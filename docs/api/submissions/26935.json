We all change how we look all the time. We dye our hair. We wear makeup. We change the style of clothes we wear. We grow or shave facial hair. We get tattoos. We get piercings. We shave body hair. We get tans. We wear glasses as fashion accessories. We straighten our teeth. We get cosmetic procedures like fillers or botox or whatever. We exercise to build muscle. Why do we consider all those things to be perfectly OK things to do that aren't reflective of some kind of deep personal hatred a person has for themselves, but if someone tries to lose weight to change the way they look that's where we draw the line as an unacceptable form of self-hate?\n\nBut secondly, it ignores the fact that there are many valid reasons for a person to want to lose weight that have nothing to do with how they look, and which have nothing to do with hating themselves. Like for me, losing weight has been the single most self-loving, body-positive thing I've ever done. It's not motivated out of self hate. It's motivated by loving myself enough to want to live longer and live a higher quality of life where I can do basic shit like walk up stairs without being out of breath, or stand on my feet all day without it feeling like excruciating torture, or wake up in the morning without chronic headaches and migraines caused by the fact that my weight was making me stop breathing in my sleep.\n\nReducing weight loss to a purely cosmetic act undertaken by vain, insecure people is ironically, in and of itself, an extremely shallow thing to do. Because, really, what's more shallow than telling people who are literally dying from obesity because they are morbidly obese that it's fine for them to be that way as long as they're still pretty, since whether or not they can be considered attractive in that state is clearly the only thing that matters, and is much more important than how long they live or what quality of life they have.", "I'd give you gold for this if I had it! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6", "If I understood how to give awards, I would definitely give you one.

She assumed that the 'lose a couple of pounds' had to do with 'beauty' and told OP she didn't need to do what OP just said she was doing ... That itself is negating and negative and rude.

Something delicate like spinach is easy for me to digest.  By contrast, kale needs to be massaged with salt and olive oil or cooked down.  Otherwise, I can\u2019t digest it.\n\nI\u2019m south Asian and can handle most rice varieties in small quantities.  I\u2019m not great with bread.  I\u2019ve recently discovered protein-enriched pastas and those have been amazing.\n\nI really like fresh fruit but have to limit my intake because I get indigestion from fruit alcohols.  I can do handfuls of berries and citrus fruit.  I have to watch my intake from stone fruits and apples because it feels like I might s*** myself.", "I think it\u2019s totally okay to come at it from a place of concern. Saying that you noticed changes (particularly with respect to behavior) and want to make sure everything is alright is okay. Helping them find resources for help is also okay. \n\nBut know that if you just met someone, there\u2019s no way to know what is going on with their body or what their eating habits or attitudes are, so you shouldn\u2019t comment. It\u2019s also not okay if you come from a place of disgust or criticism (\u201cyou\u2019re way too skinny\u201d \u201cwhy don\u2019t you eat more?\u201d \u201cYou look anorexic/like a twig\u201d)", "Also, teachers have obligations as mandated reporters, so if a child is losing a bunch of weight, they would likely have to address potential neglect.", "It also happened to someone on the news being interviewed.  Something about the neck, the front side, caught the attention of a Specialist who reached out to the news people to contact the person with a recommendation to seek a Doctor regarding it.  The news verified the Specialist, contacted the person and the person got medical attention that was very much needed that they were completely unaware of.", "Yeah literally, it's funny to me sometimes. They are so desperate to look \"good\"", "Mine is psychological. I put on weight for the first time in my life and now I look like my bitch mother. It's triggering and I hate seeing my mother in the mirror. I'm losing weight so I stop looking like her.", "Don\u2019t have my glasses on and my brain read this as \u201cJust throw the damn thing at her face\u201d\u2026\n\nAll I could think before I truly processed it was \u201cyes yes this is good\u201d", "It was none of her business and she should never broached the subject to begin with.  I AM anorexic and people commenting on it is so far from appropriate.", "It's a kind of toxic positivity, it is often used against losing weight but not with gaining.  It dismisses peoples real and medical concerns, like with OP. It's fine to promote recognizing beauty in all forms, but not to tell people not to care for their own body how they see fit, especially with no evidence of na actual medical concern.", ">That's why I said \"unless she used the words eating disorder\" (because that's not actually clear from the post).\n\nI don't know how it's not clear, OP literally said that's what happened. What would the girl be diagnosing OP with, a poor appetite?\n\nAlso, even if she didn't explicitly mention an eating disorder, talking negatively about someone else's eating habits when you know nothing about them and it's none of your business makes you an asshole. But ok, let's play devil's advocate and say there was no mention of eating disorders so things aren't as bad as they could be. Calling OP delusional about how she  regards her own body is so uncalled for and, eating dsorders mentioned or not, *absolutely* makes her an asshole. \n\n>Because where I am from it's very normal that while you're having dinner with other people, you talk about the food and what everyone is eating and why they did or didn't chose a certain thing and in that conversation certain diets also often come up and people are happy to explain.\n\nIt really depends. I think there can be a polite way to talk about these things as long as you're not being judgemental (and topics like this are probably more acceptable between friends instead of strangers). So if the girl had simply asked OP how her food was and if it was okay that they chose what seemed to be a steakhouse when she didn't seem to be in the mood, that probably would have gone over much better. \n\nPointing out how someone isn't eating a lot *can* be fine as long as you don't push the issue or have an agenda-an honest inquiry whose intention may be to just make sure they're feeling all right or something is inoffensive if you respect the other person's answer. But that clearly wasn't the case here. \n\nThe other woman really didn't start becoming the asshole until she started pushing the narrative that OP had no idea what she was talking about regarding her own body/diet and outright calling OP delusional.", "Really? Is she OP's doctor? No? Then it isn't her business.", "As long as you understood that the soup was the meal. We\u2019re not going to Mendy\u2019s again.", "On purpose? \n\u201cNo, it\u2019s in response to the chemo, but thanks.\u201d", "In fairness, I think a lot of it came from concern. I don't get as many comments as I used to so maybe there's increased awareness that it's not okay to comment like that. Or maybe it's because I'm older and have developed a don't mess with me look, who knows. If I was with friends who heard these comments they would crack up  and tell the person not to worry about me, I just have tiny bones and must be blessed with high metabolism because I am an eating machine. :)", "Years ago my husband and I ran into a friend of my aunts. She hadn\u2019t seen me in years and she legitimately said to me, \u201cI thought that was you but I said it couldn\u2019t be because you\u2019re too fat.\u201d  This was coming from a woman who was never thin the entire time I knew her.", "Thank you!\n\nI have two kids, my body is weird since the second. I hate comments, I'd never comment on someone else. And I absolutely don't want to teach my kids that it is okay to do so.", "Lol my fiance bought me a pair of sunglasses once, then the first time I wore the sunglasses he told me that they made me look like my mother. Well that was the last time I ever did that. If he had told me he was looking to waste $50 I am sure I could have come up with some fun ways that didn't give me a complex...", "Both. Both is good.", "Soup? For an Amani suit!?", "\"Oh, I instantly recognized you because you've always been fat.\""]}
