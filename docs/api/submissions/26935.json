Just slam the whole thing down on the table.", "And would have likely done absolutely nothing for someone actively in the disorder except maybe teach them to be even more sneaky so they aren\u2019t caught.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f\n\nIf you actually *had* an eating disorder, then her commenting on (and drawing attention to) it, would have very easily just been making it even worse for you.", "fr. the only comments i want on my food, or my body, is \u201clooks good\u201d. if you have anything else to say, suck it back in. nta.", "Her comments were anything but body positive", "Even if she had some sort of qualification, out for dinner with friends would not be the time to be making diagnosis and honestly, you sound just as bad as her.", "If she is a medical professional she has even LESS reason to comment on someone's eating habits without knowing their medical history.", ">NAH unless she actually used the word eating disorder, her heart sounds like it was in the right place and it sounds like a conversation that has happened a million times\n\n\n\nOr, \nYou don't focus on how an adult is feeding themself?\n\nOr, \nYou don't continue to talk about their eating after they have rebuffed your first attempt?", ">her heart sounds like it was in the right place\n\nNo it doesn't. It was *one* meal she watched OP eat, and that gave her the confidence to make comments about how much she ate? The fact that she gave no thought to the possibility that OP might have eaten more earlier in the day, or generally eats small meals througjout the day, or simply wasn't very hungry right then, or any of the other possible reasons OP was eating a *reasonable* amount of food and focused solely on the possibility OP had an eating disorder does not mean her heart was in the right place. It means she's nosy and has a complex regarding giving ppl a psychological diagnoses despite not knowing anything about them. No one in their right mind thinks one meal is representative of a person's daily meal plan. \n\n>oh I'm trying to eat light at the moment to lose a few pounds\" - \"oh no girl you look great, you don't have to worry at all\".\n\nI know plenty of ppl do have eating disorders or otherwise view themselves as less appealing depending on their weight and it's genuinely sad that it's a concern for so many ppl, but there are also *so* many other reasons a person might want to lose weight that in this day and age, unless you know the person, believeing that it *has* to be an eating disorder is starting to become a problem. There's nothing inherently wrong with wanting to lose weight-if you don't know anything about the person's nutrition intake or how they view their body image and just assume that has to be it, well, you know what they say about assuming. \n\nBut okay, there's nothing super offensive about her telling OP she's beautiful. But then OP pointed out it's not bc of insecurty but bc of mobility, which is a perfectly logical reason even if you *don't* know that OP has a prosthetic-lots of ppl have disabilities that you may not know about, and even if they don't, weight does still affect mobility albeit less severely. So for her to then go on and claim it was actually an eating disorder and that she was *delusional* is exceedingly patronizing. She outright told OP she didn't believ her reason and thought it was an excuse. That's not doing something out of the goodness of your heart, that's trying to force a narrative bc you want to virtue signal how good of a person you are for being sympathetic toward someone with eating issues.", "It wasn't her business to armchair diagnose OP with an \"eating disorder\", regardless of her lack of knowledge of the prosthetic leg.", "I mean.. that's an easy way to lose a few pounds.. but that might not help with mobility!!", "The friend jumping immediately to \u201cdiagnosing\u201d a stranger whom she has known for five seconds tells far more about her own issues than the person she assumes has an eating disorder. \ud83d\ude44\n\nETA: NTA.", "people always tell me to eat more. yes im skinny, but im not severely underweight. i dont have any problems with food. it\u2019s super annoying - plus, if i eat too much in one sitting i feel like throwing up.", "Maybe I didn\u2019t use the phrase correctly? I mean, she was trying to tell OP that they didn\u2019t need to lose weight and that they were fine the way they are. \u201cShe immediately assured me I was beautiful the way I was and I didn\u2019t need to lose weight\u201d sounds pretty positive. Then she spirals and gets diagnostic.", "That's why I said \"unless she used the words eating disorder\" (because that's not actually clear from the post).\n\nIf she was actively diagnosing her, of course that's wrong.\n\nGoing off of the comments here and your very extensive reply maybe it's a cultural thing that is rude where you guys are from that I'm just not aware of. Because where I am from it's very normal that while you're having dinner with other people, you talk about the food and what everyone is eating and why they did or didn't chose a certain thing and in that conversation certain diets also often come up and people are happy to explain.", "There was a guy who won the NCAA national wrestling championships with one leg, Anthony Robles, and he actually turned it into an advantage which was awesome. He wrestled in the 125 pound weight class but had the upper body of a 165 pounder, so he was so strong at his weight class, and was born without the leg so he had all these balance tricks that no one could figure out. Also ran a 6 minute mile on crutches. Absolute beast while being an inspiration, he ended up winning an ESPY. Not really related to OP but you talking about losing weight and mobility made me think of hi.", "I think the main point trying to be made is she didn\u2019t stop at you look great. Even if she didn\u2019t actually use the words \u201ceating disorder\u201d, OP says she told OP she must be delusional that she was very heavy and having issues walking. I agree that if it had stopped with \u201cgirl what you look great!\u201d then whatever. But sounds like she went way past that."]}
