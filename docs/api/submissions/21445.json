You tried.\n\nI was under 13, when we had to research the Roman Gods for Latin class... It wasn't pretty, but it's just a story.

She\u2019s a kid and she\u2019s got a healthy curiosity and a desire to learn new things. \n\nThe only way to protect her from what she found is to never do anything that sparks that curiosity. That would be such a waste. There are only so many years in life where we\u2019re just naturally inquisitive like that. Let her make the most of hers.", "Clearly YTA. Why didn\u2019t you invent Time Machine and destroy Greek civilization.", "NTA It\u2019s not like you handed her a list of the most inappropriate myths.

The internet is an open prairie of information on anything in any case as well.

Quite honestly at 12 she can\u2019t be far off being taught similar themes in school anyway.

Greek mythology is nothing by comparison. \n\nGarp is still my favorite book and I'm 37. I really think it helped me understand how the world works.

They are now well adjusted adults with a good background in antiquities and Renaissance art. \n\nDuring the Victorian era Charles Bulfinch wrote a concise though somewhat sanitised collection of myths. His rationale was that people needed to know the ancient stories to be able to understand references made in the writings of Milton, Chaucer, and Shakespeare among others, and to gain a fuller appreciation for the arts in general.

Her looking up Greek mythology or some of the crap out there on all social media platforms these days?", "Nta. Odds are if she was that interested in it she'd end up looking it up from school anyway. That's about the age they cover the ancient worlds in public schools, so unless she's a sheltered homeschooler, she was going to hear about it anyway. \n\nAlso if her parents are that strict in what they allow their kid to read they should have previewed the book first after you gave it to see if they felt it was appropriate.", "My dad got me an unabridged encyclopedia of Greek Mythology when I was 8, after Hercules came out (and he couldn\u2019t answer anymore of my questions!) and it\u2019s still one of my most treasured books today.

So many sex scenes in movies and TV no to mention the gore in video games. She should celebrate her daughter asking questions so she can be there to give answers and have that talk before goofy kids tell her the wrong thing. This is mom\u2019s time to shine.
