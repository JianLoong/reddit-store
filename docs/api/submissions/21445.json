You tried.\n\nI was under 13, when we had to research the Roman Gods for Latin class... It wasn't pretty, but it's just a story.

The internet is an open prairie of information on anything in any case as well.

They are now well adjusted adults with a good background in antiquities and Renaissance art. \n\nDuring the Victorian era Charles Bulfinch wrote a concise though somewhat sanitised collection of myths. His rationale was that people needed to know the ancient stories to be able to understand references made in the writings of Milton, Chaucer, and Shakespeare among others, and to gain a fuller appreciation for the arts in general.

That's about the age they cover the ancient worlds in public schools, so unless she's a sheltered homeschooler, she was going to hear about it anyway. \n\nAlso if her parents are that strict in what they allow their kid to read they should have previewed the book first after you gave it to see if they felt it was appropriate.", "My dad got me an unabridged encyclopedia of Greek Mythology when I was 8, after Hercules came out (and he couldn\u2019t answer anymore of my questions!) and it\u2019s still one of my most treasured books today.

So many sex scenes in movies and TV no to mention the gore in video games. She should celebrate her daughter asking questions so she can be there to give answers and have that talk before goofy kids tell her the wrong thing. This is mom\u2019s time to shine.

It's not that serious and I'm sure at her age or soon she'll hear worse at school. Especially, if this is the US you're in. These kids literally have lock down active shooter drills and your sister is worried about stories of zeus sleeping around and Hercules killing his wife and kids? Although I will add I was also allowed to read the adult versions of fairy tales and those are pretty messed up too. This honestly has me wondering now if my mom knew what I was reading. I'll say though I have a huge live of horror slasher movies nows.", "Good grief, I read the Iliad and Odyssey for the first time when I was in third grade and on a Greek mythology kick. I asked the librarian for more books I hadn\u2019t read, and that\u2019s what she gave me. My mom was amused, and we had great conversations about it\u2014 I suspect she was reading them while I was at school so she could discuss them with me.\n\nIf your sister wants to protect her daughter, she is being ridiculous. Just by reading the newspaper or watching the news the girl will see horrors, let alone walking down the street being cat called by older men.", "12 is the very age almost every girl got into egyptian, greek or witching era lol. She can handle it", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not like you gave her the unedited version. You gave a version of the tales appropriate for her age. Ask her mother why she wasn\u2019t monitoring the contents of her reading materials.", "NTA. At that age for some reason kids are into\"scary/gory\" stuff she will have found it with no help.\n\nI think your gift was thoughtful, and good for you to try to find a kids version. \n\nAlso, what about Disney. classic Disney movies usually come from gory stories is your sister upset at Disney too.", "NTA, I was definitely reading Greek and Norse myths earlier than that and nothing bad happened, unless you count a lifelong interest in weird stories and designing a D&D setting based on Greek City States as a school project once", "Nope. NTA. 12 is a very common age to get into Greek mythology. My kids both loved it from around this age.  And honestly if your niece is reading and watching what other kids her age are, she's already come across plenty of gory stuff.", "NTA.\n\nHave you read the bible?\n\nThere are stories that are as bad and sometimes even worse.", "She's 12 and has access to the internet, school libraries, YouTube, and various teachers and adults. \n\nYour aunt is being ridiculous, and should be using this as a teaching opportunity on how to handle stuff like this.\n\nAlso, may I recommend the \"horrible histories\" series? They're an oldie but goodie for a reason.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nIf she goes to public school, she will be exposed to mythology and all of its craziness in middle school\n\nIf she goes to church, she is already exposed to the Bible\u2019s craziness\n\nIf she spends time with insane Boomer grandparents, then your sister should be worried, as she\u2019ll be exposed to endless amounts of Faux News and THAT is extremely dangerous rhetoric and corporate sponsored propaganda", "NTA. Your gift was a thoughtful, educational, and sparked a healthy interest in other cultures and belief systems. As for age appropriateness, if your niece lives in the US then she's probably in Middle School. She'd probably learn about Greek Mythology there anyway.", "NTA\n\nIf the kid is given unrestricted access to the Internet, something like this was going to happen eventually. \n\nShe overhears a weird conversation and googles some words.\n\nShe looks up an original Disney story.\n\nShe finds adult content hidden within kid's content for various reasons.\n\nAutocorrect or a voice-to-text mistranslation goes *terribly wrong*.\n\nThe possibilities are endless.", "NTA. She's twelve, not five. She needs to start learning about the seedy parts of life. Ignorance is NOT bliss.\n\nAnd she's learning independently, which is something many kids never do. Mom should be proud. And also should be prepared to have some VERY uncomfortable conversations over the course of the next few years. How Mom reacts to this will determine whether her daughter comes to her when she's been harassed or sexually assaulted. Tell Mom that open conversations on difficult topics now will pay HUGE dividends over the next ten or more years. Experienced mom of three curious, independent learners here ..", "NTA. My 10 year old has been deep diving into Greek and Roman mythology for at least a year. He loves it, and it gets him reading and researching so I love it.", "It's your fault, but it being your fault does not the A H make.\n\nShe's twelve, I was in 8th grade at her age, and she's more that old enough to search topics on her own.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It's her parent's job to ensure she accesses age appropriate materials. You gave her a book without any of the unsavoury details included. They're just annoyed you made their job \"harder\".", "NTA - Get her the Percy Jackson series next!", "NTA   \n\n\nAs a former myth-loving child (and current shit-stirrer adult and parent), I love this. Let her discover Ovid's Metamorphoses on her own, though. So pervy!\n\nBetter she read about these things from ancient stories rather than finding stepmother porn on TikTok. I don't mean to be cavalier about this, but honestly, between Flowers in the Attic and the Jackie Collins novels my mom tried to hide from me on top of the fridge when I was 12, mythology was the least disturbing thing I could read. I mean, yeah, castration and incest and gore, but clearly storytelling. Parents these days, sheesh.", "NTA. How could you forsee she would go beyond and do research on her own? Parents should have a child-friendly search engine on all electronics, this is not on you. Your sister wants someone to blame for the awkwardness of having to explain incest and castration.", "I was reading Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology at 6-7 yrs old. My cousin who was 26 yrs old would bring me a different book every weekend, and I loved it!! NTA", "NTA. It was around 12\u201413 that my education system started introducing students to sex ed/health. If a teenager has been deemed old enough to be tought about STDs and sexual assault then the concepts and definitions of incest and, while morbid, castration,(gotta learn about Alan Turing eventually), shouldnt be beyond their understanding. \n\nEducation and knowledge are almost never a bad thing to be ashamed of. And heck, you got her the tame version, not your fault she had access to google.", "NTA.  It's like someone teaching American (Or english/French/Spanish etc) history and being upset when a kid discovers what happened to slaves, the crusades, spanish inquisition etc.\n\nIf anything you shouldn't need to water down that much for 12 year olds.", "NTA. School books had the sanitized stories in them and my dad bought me a large volume of Greek mythology in junior high because of it. It was there is discovered all the rape. So much rape.", "NTA. When I was a kid these books were in the library's kid section. My parents didn't seem to care. Maybe it's cause I was able to skip over words I weren't familiar with. You even went out of your way yo find a kid friendly book too. Still if by piquing intetest alone you might slightly be at fault but that's grasping at straws", "Curse those ancient Greeks", "It's always Zeus' fault.", "Just skip the parts in the original versions that involve murder, cannibalism, etc", "We had a \"kid's\" version of Grimm's fairy tales, with beautiful illustrations. One of the stories involves a little girl, looking for something I can't even remember what, well she finds a locked door and of course the only way to unlock it is to CUT OFF HER PINKY FINGER AND USE IT AS A KEY. WTF. Haven't forgotten that bit as long as I have lived.", "Give them the Brick bible.\n\nAll the interesting bits of the Bible illustrated with Lego blocks.\n\nhttps://thebrickbible-206843.square.site/", "Right?", "Just curious, are you German? I\u2019ve never known a native English speaker to use a comma before \u201cthat\u201d, was wondering if it\u2019s a habit carried over.", "Knowing mythology is actually quite useful\n\nMy AP class included reading sections of the Christian Bible that were commonly alluded to in literature. As someone who was not raised Christian and am still not Christian it was certainly useful to learn. My intro philosophy classes in college also included a few readings from the Bible as it helped establish the basis of some of the ideas behind some philosophies.", "A book. OP gave their niece a book. Could have been Percy Jackson, a middle grade series for children. \n\nHow is that OP's fault that she reserched further and her mother doesn't apparently have any kind of internet restrictions?", "This is like saying if you give a kid a Percy Jackson book, you've introduced them to porn. Ridiculous.", "I should add I also read less-sanitized fairy tales. In fact, as a small child I turned up my nose at the notion of the princess kissing the frog. In the version I was familiar with she lobbed him against a wall.", "Will definitely do so.", "There's *nothing* in this story *worthy* of blame.", "The red shoes is a Hans Christen Andersen story. I have his giant anthology :) \nThat story has also stuck itself deep within my memories", "Rule 34 strikes again", "At the very least, the cliffs notes.  (Had to buy them for my AP English back in the day.  Teacher referred to it as the Christian myth.)\n\nI loved mythology, I already knew most of the myths by the time I got to Mythology class in 10th grade.  Pretty sure that was my parent's fault for taking me to see Clash of the Titans when it came out and I was like 8 years old. \n\nSo is momma religious or just uptight?", "I love those books for my niece and nephews", "Yeah, my class read Antigone in 10th grade. The first time I encountered Greek mythology in a school setting was 3rd grade, and there's only so much sanitization they can do before even an elementary school kid puts 2 and 2 together.", "OP did that because they knew sister would throw a fit if the kid read the real stuff - as sister in fact did.", "That's a pretty accurate summary of Greek mythology", "According to Hera it was always Zeus\u2019 bastard\u2019s fault", "Hence the book Zeus Grants Stupid Wishes.", "Now now, let's not erase the Mycenaeans or Etruscans!", "The Red Shoes is Andersen though?", "The Cliff Notes of the Bible would probably take out all the raunchy bits...", ">So is momma religious or just uptight?\n\nYes", "You're not wrong, Ezekiel 23 has both violence and slut shaming. Verse 20 is sometimes mentioned as rather frank sex reference (There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.) but the context is not so funny", "I read the Illiad in HS and I graduated in 2006. My.kid read both the Illiad and the Odyssey, and they just finished 9th grade. They're both classical literature. Plenty of high schools require them for reading, even if yours didnt. My kid's friends at different schools in the district also had to read the Odyssey."]}
