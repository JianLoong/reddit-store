I can't wait for this child to discover the Bible!", "NTA it's so easy for kids to stumble upon crazy stuff nowadays. You could've given them a book about donald the duck and via research they'd find hentai or something.", "NTA.\n\nGet your niece her a nice edition of Grimms fairy tales by way of apology to you sister.\n\nThen everyone will be happy.", "NTA, you gave her a clean book. You tried.\n\nI was under 13, when we had to research the Roman Gods for Latin class... It wasn't pretty, but it's just a story. My crazyness didn't come from knowing, that Kronos ate children or that Zeus is terrible predator or how Aphrodite came to be according to some myths. I just think, that the Greek Gods have issues.", "Well did you put her on the internet? How dare you give her access to information.\n\nNTA. Your sister sounds lovely.", "NTA. \n\nNo, you\u2019re not to blame and at 12 years old I find it hard to believe she\u2019s never heard of the Greek gods before. She\u2019s a kid and she\u2019s got a healthy curiosity and a desire to learn new things. \n\nThe only way to protect her from what she found is to never do anything that sparks that curiosity. That would be such a waste. There are only so many years in life where we\u2019re just naturally inquisitive like that. Let her make the most of hers.", "Clearly YTA. Why didn\u2019t you invent Time Machine and destroy Greek civilization.", "NTA It\u2019s not like you handed her a list of the most inappropriate myths. Besides, your niece is almost in high school, she\u2019s probably heard worse stuff or will hear eventually.", "NTA 100%. You got her an age-appropriate gift, it's that simple.", "Just wait until she gets her hand on a bible\u2026.", "NTA\nYes she is 12 but she\u2019s curious. I do get it. The internet is an open prairie of information on anything in any case as well. Honestly, rather than condemning it, it\u2019s probably better to openly discuss it. you even went the extra mile to get a child friendly version - id rather congratulate your niece on her curiosity for wanting to know more.", "NTA. Kudos to your niece for actually wanting to learn about something. So many kids just take information for face value and never dig deeper.", "NTA- Was I the opposite of sheltered or is 12 old enough to be exposed to stuff like this during independence research? She is nearly a teenager.", "NTA, the book you got was abridged to be age appropriate so it's not on you. Your Sil might not realize that this is a subject covered in a lot of schools around this age, finding less abridged books is not exactly going to be difficult for a 12 year old.", "NTA. The same result could have come from her watching Hercules, or any Disney film and reading into the Brothers Grimm. If your sister didn\u2019t want her reading those things, she should have been monitoring what content she was being exposed to, there\u2019s far worse out there. Quite honestly at 12 she can\u2019t be far off being taught similar themes in school anyway. I went to a Welsh primary school that taught us our folklore entirely un-sanitised from around age 6 and they get pretty darn gnarly. Nobody was traumatised.", "We read Edith Hamilton Mythology in 6th grade for honors English. \n\nNTA", "Would your sister balme Disney if her daughter finds out The Little Mermaid actually dies in the original version and the guy Esmerelda falls in love w/ in Hunchback of Notre Dame tries to rape her in the book? \n\nWait till she finds out what happens to Cinderella's sisters or what Elsa (The Snow Queen) is REALLY like.\n\nNot to mention, all she had to do was watch Hercules to get interested in greek myths.\n\nYour sister can't blame you. You gave her age appropriate material. If your sister is concerned about what her daughter picks up and reads on her own than she needs to monitor it.\n\nI knew a lot of kids that were into Myths at that age or even younger. Honestly, 12 is fine for that stuff for most kids.", "NTA- Sounds like a smart kid.", "NTA. Mom is in for a rough ride\u2026.", "NTA\n\nAnd not for nothing, but better for her to learn at a young age how dumb religions can be, anyway.", "NTA. Greek mythology is very interesting and friendly for all ages . Your niece should be quite smart to search it by herself more . But i guess she found more stuff on internet that obviously her parents allow to her to use it in such a young age .so their problem", "NTA, I feel like 12 is around the age most kids start learning about some of the nastier stuff in the world like that. If she didn't learn about it through what you gave her and her subsequent research she would have learned about it from somewhere else.", "NTA.  12 is old enough even for the Iliad version.  \n\nI hope your sister has explained all of this to her daughter.  The daughter is past the age where she should have a thorough understanding of how human sexuality works.", "NTA! Sounds like the niece found a love for something and came across it in other books.", "NTA\n\nAnd now your niece will recognize the references to various Greek gods in literature!\n\nWould sis be upset if you gave your niece a watered-down version of the Bible and she looked up the real stories? Rape, incest, soft pornography, etc.", "NTA. When I was 12 my parents bought me \"The World According to Garp\" and \"Breakfast of Champions\". Those two books were formative for me. Greek mythology is nothing by comparison. \n\nGarp is still my favorite book and I'm 37. I really think it helped me understand how the world works. It's not pretty, and it's not just black and white sexually. The movie loses so much of the nuance.", "Nta, you gave her book anything beyond that is your sister to blame if your niece was able to find things on the Internet. That\u2019s a parent problem not a book problem", "Nope had the same obsession when I was twelve. My sisters was a year older and we both loved mythology so much we read all the books they had on base. NTA!  My mom never seemed to mind. I think she was just proud we read at a college level \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Kids are curious & will go searching for their unanswered questions. We read these type of books when we were 8/9 yrs old. Parents told us it was mythology. It got us all interested. Greek, Roman, Spartan, ect\u2026I got interested in ancient history. So did my brothers.", "NTA. She\u2019s 12, not 5.", "NTA.  She is 12 years-old and probably has heard of incest and/or castration without using those words.  If sis doesn\u2019t want her to look up castration and incest, she should be monitoring what her daughter can do on the internet.", "No way are you the AH. The kid is 12. I'm pretty sure by then my age group all knew about the Greek gods and their debauchery. I was reading way more risque stuff than that at that age and I went to a private Christian school.\n\n\n\nNTA", "NTA. Every single piece of mythology, religion, and even atheism has a bunch of gore and sexual related topics in them. Also, it's not your fault your niece got curious and decided to research more.

We read Greek mythology in school at age 10, and it's still one of my absolute favorite study units of all time.

Almost everyone I grew up with had a Greek mythology phase and the Percy Jackson series certainly didn\u2019t help. If your sister was that worried about what her daughter is viewing why doesn\u2019t she have parental controls on her devices since I\u2019m assuming she didn\u2019t do her research at the library but more than likely on a phone tablet laptop etc. She\u2019s 12 not 5.", "I read worse stuff in the public library at a younger age, if your sister didn\u2019t want her learning about it she should have more carefully monitored her internet usage or the books she was bringing home. Could have been a interest she explored in a child friendly way with her child too.", "An inquisitive child is a blessing, you did well NTA. What surprised me though is how a child of 12 has not already explored Greek mythology at school. It is part of the curriculum in most countries I believe", "NTA", "NTA so much! I told my godkids stories from the Greco-Roman myths at bedtime and they loved them. They are now well adjusted adults with a good background in antiquities and Renaissance art. \n\nDuring the Victorian era Charles Bulfinch wrote a concise though somewhat sanitised collection of myths. His rationale was that people needed to know the ancient stories to be able to understand references made in the writings of Milton, Chaucer, and Shakespeare among others, and to gain a fuller appreciation for the arts in general. It\u2019s appropriate for a 12 year old if anyone has concerns.", "NTA\n\nYou encouraged an enquiring mind and castration and incest are concepts that exist. \n\nIf your sister is concerned about what she learns, she should be monitoring her research more closely. \n\nShe\u2019s 12. What\u2019s going to happen because she knows about these two concepts? \n\nI\u2019m going assume you didn\u2019t give her a version which talks about ropes of Uranus\u2019 semen frothing in the ocean. \n\nShe could have just as easily seen those words in the dictionary.", "NTA \n\nAt 12 I was reading adult books. No harm done. \n\nThey all grow up.", "NTA \nI read the grim fairytales when I was 6. At 12 I was reading Romeo and Juliet, and scarlet letter", "NTA I\u2019m mean she could have researched after the Disney version of Hercules. I mean that\u2019s pretty watered down. And she\u2019s 12 I\u2019m sure she\u2019s gonna learn about soon at school.", "NTA. It\u2019s the parent\u2019s responsibility to monitor what their kid does in the internet. Also not sure it would be appropriate nowadays, but I am pretty sure I learned about greek mythology around that age with all those \u201cunclean\u201d details in history class. We also did Oedipus Rex and Antigone when we were 12 in theater class. But I guess that wasn\u2019t a big issue in the early 2000s as it would be today.", "NTA and these sound like totally normal things for a 12 year old to have a morbid curiosity about.", "Well, technically, you did introduce it to her so it would be your fault.

Rape and incest!", "NTA by that age I had learned about Greek mythology in school. I'm surprised she hasn't.", "I did my social studies fair project at age 11 or 12, I forget which, on Greek mythology, so no. I had this great mythology book that covered Egyptian, Norse, Hindu, Greek, and Roman mythology, it was incredibly detailed", "NTA lmao", "NTA. What\u2019s wrong with reading Greek mythology (and the Bible as many people have mentioned) at 12? I started reading them at 13. It was very different, no logic, just very interesting stories.", "NTA, and I\u2019m a parent. History isn\u2019t for the faint of heart but these lurid tales keep a young person interested in learning!", "We did a unit on Greek mythology when I was in 5th grade. We read Percy Jackson and of course we looked up the original stories and whatnot. NTA ask your sister if she wants to fight my fifth grade teacher too", "NTA. I mean honestly- what\u2019s worse? Her looking up Greek mythology or some of the crap out there on all social media platforms these days?", "Nta. Odds are if she was that interested in it she'd end up looking it up from school anyway. That's about the age they cover the ancient worlds in public schools, so unless she's a sheltered homeschooler, she was going to hear about it anyway. \n\nAlso if her parents are that strict in what they allow their kid to read they should have previewed the book first after you gave it to see if they felt it was appropriate.", "My dad got me an unabridged encyclopedia of Greek Mythology when I was 8, after Hercules came out (and he couldn\u2019t answer anymore of my questions!) and it\u2019s still one of my most treasured books today. NTA, go for it!", "I'm guessing this is your sister's first girl child, because LOL yeah we sure do that.  Just like boys in the stereotype like frogs and icky stuff, girls get into SHOCKING CONTENT.  Why do you think it's a cliche for women to be into true crime? \n\nI'm guessing sister didn't do a lot of research into the fairy tales she let her kid read. DonkeySkin, for example, is pretty incesty.  Bluebeard, kind of rapey.  I mean, SLEEPING BEAUTY?  \n\nNTA, girls gonna girl and what's wrong with a little knowledge?", "NTA The book you gave was age appropriate . Check out the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan if this is her interest (all his books actually). He was a junior high history teacher before becoming an author. My 13yo loves his books- great stories with lots of mythology based on accurate history.", "NTA- OMG does your sister honestly think a 12 year old hasn\u2019t read or seen worse? So many sex scenes in movies and TV no to mention the gore in video games. She should celebrate her daughter asking questions so she can be there to give answers and have that talk before goofy kids tell her the wrong thing. This is mom\u2019s time to shine. BTW- knowing mythology really helps in advance classes in HS and college.", "NTA, you gave an age-appropriate gift. Maybe your sister should be looking at why her 12-year-old is able to easily access material she finds inappropriate.", "NTA. My daughter got really into Greek myths much earlier. I highly recommend the Percy Jackson book series. Or if the niece wants to learn the myths there are Percy Jackson books on Greek gods and hero\u2019s. They give the myths in a pre teen voice.", "NTA. At her age, my friends and I were obsessed with Greek mythology and we turned out alright. We would discuss this at school and we were happy geeks.", "She\u2019s 12. I have a 12yo. He\u2019s been into Greek mythology for years. They read it in their public school.
