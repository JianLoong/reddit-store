Last Friday I had a house party and I told Jens friends that they are welcome to come but they can\u2019t bring Jen. They were like what did Jen do I was like she is black listed.\n\nJen came anyways that night, I told her she isn\u2019t welcome. She made a huge scene but eventually left. The party was still great, I didnt tell people why she was blacklisted but my roommates.\n\nThey said it was harsh, and that I embarrassed her in front of her friends. I did not see it as a big deal as I told her before she  came.

Putting that much weight on your instagram following means you definitely need a social media break. She could have unfollowed you for a million reasons. Social media is a very filtered lens.
