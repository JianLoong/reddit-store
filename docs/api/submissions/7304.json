My daughter is 2.5yrs old and they\u2019ve seen each other maybe 4-5 times in her life. So my sister is visiting in 2wks and staying with us. She called me last week and said when I visit I\u2019m taking daughter to the beach when I come. I was kinda like oh ok are you just. My sister is very pushy and very much her way or no way. I said ahhh ok then. After talking about it with my wife we both decided we don\u2019t want her going to the beach alone (without us) Our daughter hasn\u2019t ever been anywhere with anyone alone, it\u2019s always us. Not because we don\u2019t want her to, it just never happens, our car has the child seat and we just do stuff as a family or meet other family members where we need to. \n\nFast forward to today. \n\nWe had a phone call and I said Look we\u2019re not super comfortable with her going to the beach, she can\u2019t swim but is obsessed with the water and just sprints for the waves (she\u2019s 2.5yr old and been to the beach 3-4 times, she has no idea what she\u2019s doing\u2026she\u2019s a toddler lol) we struggle to keep hold of her when we take her and it\u2019s honestly just a big stress trip when we do. Happy for you to take her somewhere else, take our car etc but just not the beach, we\u2019re just not comfortable with it. \n\nShe went quiet and that was pretty much it. 5 minutes later I got a text \u201ccall me when you\u2019re free\u201d \n\nI called her and she\u2019s crying, I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t trust me to take her, I\u2019m sad that you think that of me, I\u2019d never let anything happen to her, I live on the water etc etc I tried explaining why but she just kept saying how it\u2019s no different to going to a park together and something happening there. \n\nI kept explaining it\u2019s got nothing to do with not trusting her, it\u2019s that this is the first time she\u2019s ever gone anywhere with someone without us, and we don\u2019t want it to be to a place where we struggle to keep her in check and safe. And also the first time they\u2019ve ever been anywhere together alone too. \n\nAnyway she didn\u2019t really listen and we had to cut the phone call short and now I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s even going to come, and if she does she\u2019s just going to be bitter about not going to the beach. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673675173, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bgtic/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_take_my_toddler_to/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
