I was out of town on a business trip. Hubby (37) was home alone the entire week as kiddo was with my folks because my parents helped get her to and from school. (Hubby has to be at work at 530 am, so can't take kiddo to school). \n\nOver the past 13 years, at least half of the birthdays for me have had the \"I didn't have time to get you anything\" excuse. He knows just a card is enough to me.  Just the thought of going out of his ordinary way to get a 5 dollar card,  write something nice in it and giving it to me is enough to make me feel thought about. I got home from my trip yesterday (Friday) and got the same \"I didn't get you a card because I was busy and wanted to take the kid to get you one but she was with your parents and i forgot to stop when i picked her up\" He took me out to dinner and knew I was hoping to be intimate but he was too tired to initimate, so I just gave him head and when to sleep. If i bring it up,  he'll get mad and say,  \"I cleaned the house while you were gone\" which I already acknowledged and thanked him for. We're already in a nearly sexless marriage (once a month if that) but I give him head at least once a week. He is a good provider and is a decent dad,  so I try to give him the benefit of the doubt. \n\nFor his birthday, I helped the kiddo make one of those candy bar posters, which he loved. So is not like I'm not acknowledging his birthday. \n\nWe've fought about this in the past. One year I brought up that I was disappointed that I didn't get a card (he knows o keep all the holiday and birthday cards I get) and he got super mad that I knew how stressed he was and he cleaned the house,  but I \"expect some grand gesture\" on my birthday. \n\nAITA for being upset that he didn't do anything for my birthday again when i returned from my business trip the next day?\n\n\nUpdate: I told him I was disappointed in not getting a card and he got super pissed and stormed out of the house to go get me a card.", "created_utc": 1668275768, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytdxr5/aita_another_sorry_i_didnt_have_time_birthday/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's only logical, expected *and* completely normal that your husband would take care the mess he created by himself. \n\nBuying a card is not a grand gesture. If he bought you an actual gift that would not be a grand gesture either. \n\nSleeping with you is certainly not something he should have to force himself to do if he doesn't want to - but if he isn't in the mood for sex, he should not have and keep having you blow him without him recuperating.\n\nWhat does he even bring to the table that you wouldn't receive if you split up and shared custody 50/50? And I don't mean this in any \u201cdivorce that guy\" way, I'm honestly curious. Because he seems to be neither your actual partner-in-life nor your lover.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Serious question. Are you a doormat? Do you like being a doormat?\nHe doesn't need/ want to have sex with you, because he gets off once a week becasue you blow him off. And he doesnt care to nor has to reciprocate because he knows he has a doormat of a wife who does everything for him anyway. So what of he cleaned the house whilst you were away on a work business. Why do you need to thank your partner for doing the bare minimum? Plus he was the one living in the home whilst you were away, so he was only cleaning his own mess.\nAnd the forgetting your birthday consistently shows your husband does not respect you one bit. And he knows he will get away with it because you're a doormat. He is supposed to love you. Who doesn't want to shower the person they love with gifts or even a cheap CARD to make them fee special and appreciated? \nOPEN YOUR EYES!\nsorry to be rude but situations like this piss me off, where one person is in such an unfair situation which they themselves contribute to because they never stand up for themselves because they don't want to upset their beloved partners. Wake up and realise your husband doesn't care about upsetting you. He doesn't care about you period. Doesn't matter if he says he loves. Where is the ACTION? \nACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.

Life is way too short to be unhappily married.", "NTA... nobody is too busy to buy a card... if he has such low energy that working full time and cleaning the house means he literally doesn't manage to do anything else he should see a doctor. You were on a business trip so that implies you are also working - therefore him cleaning the house is not worth mentioning, it's just a normal responsibility. He did take younout for dinner so at least he didn't completely ignore it. I understand the frustration about sex, but obviously he shouldn't feel pressured to have set if he doesn't want to.

What do you really get from this marriage? A good provider and \u201cdecent\u201d dad does not a husband make.", "NTA. It takes two minutes to order a card and gift online", "NTA. Your husband is disengaged from your marriage. Whether he just takes you for granted or has something else going on, it's not fair to you. He doesn't even reciprocate sexually. And no, he doesn't get to use the excuse that he cleaned the house while you were gone. That's just basic adult behavior. You can try a \"come to Jesus talk\" with him. You can give him an ultimatum that you will leave if things don't change. You can try marriage counseling. Or you can just give up and leave. Only you can decide, but you are absolutely correct that he's not being a good partner in aspect of your marriage so don't let him tell you otherwise.

And he was too tired for intimacy but was still happy to accept head...on your birthday. And you do that for him every week with nothing in return despite you wanting intimacy. I'm not exactly how to word this without it sounding like \"withhold oral sex until you get something in return\" but there's really no other way of putting it. He's taking and he's not giving. That needs to stop or you're going to get really resentful really quickly", "NTA. Stop expecting him to be someone he is not - a thoughtful, generous husband. He doesn't care about your love language or your libido. Buy your own card and a great vibrator as a gift, and take care of your own needs. Get yourself something gorgeous every year (ideally with his money) and then tell him thanks for the gift. BTW, I WISH I got sex once a month. But I always get a birthday card, so I guess it's all relative. Does he even deserve head? It doesn't sound like it.

I'm really starting to question what is the point of this marriage.  For so long,  he was the bread winner and when I finished my degree, I was able to make enough so he could quit the breadwinner job and take a less stressful job.  This was about 2 years ago. I've always felt like he's a best friend to me,  but im starting to question it after realizing how much I've been walked all over the past few years.", "Not rude at all.

And just because other people have it worse it doesn't mean she should settle for apathy and indifference. Also nowhere does it say she pestered him to have sex. He is the one that just wanted to get a blow*job and then get to sleep", "While we don't have that information I'll bet that the restaurant he took OP to was their usual place or something similar, where no reservations were required, and was paid for by their shared bank account to which OP is certainly contributing to. The plan to take OP there was probably also made only after they came home and received gifts and/or cards from others or directly asked the husband about it. \n\nI would agree with you about a birthday dinner being as good as a card or flowers or maybe even better - if and only if there was more than one thought and any kind of planing that went into it.\n\nYour partner was away for work on their birthday. You know they care about their birthday so you planed and booked a nice dinner at a nice restaurant for when they are back, arranged a babysitter, and made sure they had a great time? That's great!\n\nYour partner was away for work on their birthday. You did not really spend any thought on that. When they came back you realised that you did not arrange anything for their birthday even though you knew that it's important to them. You take them to some restaurant and tell them that your \"gift\" to them should be that you didn't let your shared home turn into a pigsty? Not great. Do you even see them as your partner who you love and want to be happy, or are they simply a maid and nanny that you actually don't even like all that much?\n\nSometimes it really *is* the thought that counts.", "Not every post has an art room.", "A best friend listens to you, acknowledges your feelings, tries to be supportive and thinks of you on your birthday. As far as I\u2019ve gathered from your post, your husband does none of that. \n\nOthers have already commented on the cleaning and bj, so not really anything to add there despite that I absolutely don\u2019t see why he would not be in the mood to be intimate but still want a bj. \n\nWhat are the small things he does to show you he appreciates you? Does he go down on you? Does he say thank you after you\u2019ve cleaned, cooked, done something for him (like the bj)?\n\nETA: NTA", "My best friend has never forgotten my birthday. I get a really nice card every year.", "Best friends are not pissed you want a CARD on your birthday. Please consider this marriage for what it gives you. Not much.", "Best friends don't treat you like a burden and ignore your wants and needs. You deserve better. Your kids are learning from the two of you what love is supposed to look like.
