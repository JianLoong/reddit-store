You said you were on a business trip, so obviously you work and are not a SAHM (wherein people could argue that running the household may fall solely on you). He didn\u2019t have to parent the child you share, he only had to take care of himself for a week. So \u2018he cleaned the house\u2019 aka he cleaned up after himself.

He should not be thanked or expect to be thanked for contributing to the house that he makes a mess in.

My mum was a SAHM for a few years/worked part time and my dad was often away for work. So mum did pretty much everything. But my dad stopped working away and my mum got a full time job once we were in school. And yet my dad fully expected to be praised and thanked when he did his own washing or put his own dishes in the dishwasher or vacuumed the floor that he made dirty. It really rubs me the wrong way when someone expects praise for being an adult and I think that needs to be nipped in the bud.
