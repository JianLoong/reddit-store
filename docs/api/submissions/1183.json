We were both living with our parents but he was joining the military that following summer. I love everything about him and he takes care of me and in turn I\u2019m a SAHW for the time being and we only have 1 car between the 2 of us. Which makes me feel like I lost my freedom a little bit because it\u2019s technically my car. \n\nAnyways since being home all the time and moving to a new state it\u2019s been hard for me to make friends. I\u2019ve been crying a lot and staying up all hours of the night in the living room sometimes till 9am and sleeping all day 2-4pm to make being alone during the hours he\u2019s not home go by faster.  It got to the point where I couldn\u2019t stand feeling sad and tired all the time where I ended up calling a therapist. It didn\u2019t work out and I ended up crying even more, but she ended up telling me I have major depressive disorder and anxiety. It\u2019s been this way my whole life but the difference is now I can sleep a full 8 hours (sometimes more which I know is bad but it\u2019s so hard to get up some days) and not have to worry about going anywhere or being late to anything. \n\nSo which leads me to my problem of not being able to sleep in the same bed as him. He goes to bed at a normal time 9-11pm. When I\u2019ve tried to go to sleep in our queen size bed, which is way to small for the 2 of us, it\u2019s been difficult. He falls asleep most nights in a matter of minutes and then he snores all night long, he rolls around all night which end up waking me up because I\u2019ll have a knee or elbow in my back or face. I\u2019ve been trying to sleep through the night with home because I know it makes him sad that I\u2019m not there but I\u2019ve went my whole life sleeping in peace by myself. \nAnd another thing that annoys me is he\u2019ll wake me up at randoms hours in the morning after knowing how hard it is for me to fall asleep and knowing what time I go to bed which leaves me at 9 am with 4 hours of sleep trouble falling back asleep because he had news he \u201cneeds to tell me\u201d urgently. It makes me feel like a shitty wife for not wanting to be woken up bc he wanted to tell me that he wanna race or whatever it is that day, But I\u2019m just so exhausted and I\u2019m happy to talk to him once he gets home at the end of the day About everything he did that day.

Your sleep is as important as his is, but he obviously doesn't see it that way.", "If you don't have a baby, what are you doing at home that whole time? Why are you a SAHW? You're only 21, I'm not sure why you're spending your life in your house.", "NTA, Sleep is too important to be one of those things that you \"compromise\" on, and this is something you can't really control. Maybe things will change in the future, but until then you should be allowed to get rest.", "NTA. Consider continuing to seek mental health treatment and try to convince him to take a sleep study. Sounds like he\u2019s got a solid case of sleep apnea, which can lead to a variety of other health issues and even death.", "NAH\n\nBut you really need to put some discipline back in place. That you are at home for no reason and with no purpose certainly doesn't help your quality of life.", "Yo need some structure and discipline back in your life, either a job or volunteering. Being stuck at home gives you too much time alone to wallow. And keep seeing a therapist.", "INFO:  can you drive him to work or can he carpool with a buddy?  This would allow you to get back out into the job field, get your own income in.  You are young, is this how you want to spend the next year? 5 years? 10?  Can **you start work on weekends** to start saving for that 2d vehicle?\n\nIs there any bus service if he needs a vehicle, that would allow you to go find a job?  Could you car pool when you find a job?  Could you pay someone to drive you to/from a job?\n\nPls dust yourself off, talk to your therapist even more, and *go find a job***,** do something for YOU.  My heart does go out to you coz I BTDT.  I have also known many very VERY young military spouses who just burned out fast from sitting at home all day, away from their home,  bored out of their wits.  It is not healthy for you; not healthy for your husband.", "NTA! Any good couples counselor will tell you that it's perfectly okay to sleep in separate rooms! In most cases it saves relationships. Nowhere does it say that a couple MUST sleep in the same bed at all times. You need sleep. It might make him sad, but who cares. You are sleep deprived and that's dangerous. Not only can you fall asleep driving or doing other tasks, but your immune system will tank and you'll easily get sick. \n\nWith that being said, he needs to do a sleep study. I can tell from what you say, he might have sleep apnea, which causes snoring and kicking and restless legs. He's in the military so he can certainly get that checked out right away. This will solve the problem of sleeping apart.", "Nta but i would seriously consider your position in this. I see a lot of young army marriages happen because of the benefits you receive from it while enlisted. This is obviously taking a toll on you apart from your on going sleep issues. Really take a moment to evaluate your life because as long as your isolated in some random state with nothing going on besides supporting your husband I don't see your conditions improving. Also him waking you up just because he \"needs to tell you something\" is selfish and a dick move on him. My ex was a light sleeper and sometimes we would sleep sperately because I didn't want her to lose out on sleep especially when she's had a long day and could really use the sleep. It's all about compromise.", "NTA If you can't sleep you can't sleep. But girl you're not a SAHW you are unemployed and financially dependent on a guy you met two years ago. You have zero purpose and pretty much just live for said guy and the few hours you see him after work. You are miserable. And all that at the ripe age of 21. You're barely an adult. What the hell are you doing?", "NTA", "NAH, but you need to sort your life out.\n\nThere's no reason for you to be staying up so late, and then sleeping half the morning, and it's clear that this choice of schedule is disrupting your relationship with your husband.\n\nYou don't have kids, or anything to do, so you'd be bored and lonely all day hanging around your house, and this is what has led to your awkward schedule.\n\nFix that - get out of the house. Get a job in the daytime. This will give you something to do, and also give you people to meet and interact with on a daily basis.", "OP seems a tad ungrateful, especially with the comment about the one car being hers - when she is unemployed as a \u201cSAHW.\u201d\n\nOP your sleep is important and as a fellow insomniac I understand your stress around this issue. But you should try to fix this issue about yourself rather than making it a marital issue. You are very young and very early in your relationship to throw away the intimacy of sleeping with your husband.\n\nStill, NTA, just young and stressed about not getting sleep.", "It's the army wife life my guy lol.", "Great advice.", "I know the only reason that he wakes me up sometimes is because he\u2019s excited about something or needs to vent about something bc he also has no friends. I\u2019m trying to get better I consciously know I\u2019m not well but I know my future with him will be a lot better with a few things changed", "He\u2019s the only thing the makes me happy tbh like I have severe trauma from my childhood caused by my adoptive parents it\u2019s not his fault I\u2019m this way", "You just seem like you're upset that gender roles have progressed slightly since the 1950s. (Husbands work and provide for their families so wives should just be \"grateful\" enough to be intimate with them.)\n\nIf she's a stay-at-home wife, she's already probably cleaning, cooking several meals a day, doing laundry, etc. Especially if the husband doesn't really clean up after himself, it's a job all on its own. She isn't \"ungrateful,\" she just clearly isn't happy with this situation.\n\nAlso, she's in therapy. She's already \"trying to fix this issue.\" The solution that's working is just one you don't like.", "If she has all day to do said cooking and cleaning for herself and one other person this should NOT even come close to an 8 hour workday. And how have gender roles reversed in this scenario? She is a SAHW to a military husband at 22. Her sleep disorder and attachment issues are impacting her marriage and as I said, I understand the insomnia aspect, but acting like she can\u2019t do more to better herself removes her agency in the relationship."]}
