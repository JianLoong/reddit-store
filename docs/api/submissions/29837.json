Our arrangement was to put most of our money into a joint account for all bills and shared expenses, and keep a small amount in a personal account for fun money.\n\nShortly after we were married four years ago, she had a mental health crisis and stopped working. While we had to cut significantly from our normal spending, I decided it was a good idea to keep allocating a nominal amount to our personal accounts. There were some difficult austerity decisions that had to be made, but I was happy to come through for her in a crisis.\n\nOver the next few years while my wife recovered but did not return to work, my career went well and I now make a bit more than we used to jointly, and I fund our personal accounts proportionally, but with hers at 2x mine in hopes that it will get her out of the house during the work week. We were both very happy when we found out she was pregnant last year, and I have (mostly) come to terms with the reality that our marriage will unexpectedly have brutally traditional gender roles for at least decades.\n\nSince the baby was born, I have noticed that she is spending significantly more from the joint account on stuff that usually comes from our personal accounts - Starbucks, Sephora, Alamo, creator subscriptions, etc. Then last week she got an expensive tattoo, using her personal account, and even bragged about how she saved up for it. I understand that post-baby a tattoo may feel like a way of reclaiming her body a bit, but this was a very extravagant one. While she has good taste and I like her tattoos, I'm feeling like she is embezzling from the joint account to pay for luxuries while I am still largely living with our austerity budget.\n\nThe money isn't the difference between having or skipping groceries/meds/mortgage/etc, but it is the difference between me getting double protein on my chipotle, or taking an Uber to work when it snows vs riding the bike. I feel like the majority of my personal account pays for her b'day/Xmas/vday/anniversary presents, and that maybe she has gotten a little too comfortable being a daily Starbucks mom.\n\nSo, am I a just salty bitch who resents my role in the household? Am I taking it out on her unfairly? Or is this worth bringing up? We have a strong relationship and are enjoying being new parents,  but since she stopped working money has always been an extremely uncomfortable topic.", "created_utc": 1698502087, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17iejni/aita_for_being_upset_with_how_wife_spends_her/", "score": 272, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't get distracted by judging what she spends her personal money on. However, are you also using the joint account for personal expenses? You mentioned Chipotle... Isn't that a personal expense? If you are both using the joint account in this way, you need to pull back and renegotiate what the actual terms are, and hold eachother to the same standards. NAH yet.", "NTA.

Sounds like it is time for you two to have a serious look at your finances and redetermine how you allocate them. Budgeting money for specific areas may help. It sounds like she is very comfortable not contributing financially living beyond your comfortable means. It is unclear if this is because she is not aware of the financial situation or she doesn\u2019t care.", "Maybe the tattoo is why she embezzled from the joint account, maybe monitor it a bit and see if that is the case before mentioning it.", "NTA, but you need to have a conversation with your wife about finances and what your shared goals for money are. She probably doesn't realize how expensive her habits are, and you might get a better handle on the cause of these spends.\n\nI get on the same page with my wife with regular check-ins. She'll break down her visa spending (most of her cash outflow) and I'll go over where we need to be for our vacations/mortgage/etc.. We're in the same boat as you that we don't need to watch every penny, but seeing how spending changes can affect the big picture helps both of us. We have the same goals, and this way we both know how to achieve them.\n\nIt's alright being the person who brings this up too. With most of our friends there's always one person in a couple who handles the finances. It's not a gender role thing and it even happens even when both people should be good at money (in one case *two* accountants!). You've undertaken this important chore, now it's time to steer the ship.\n\nGood luck. Not an easy conversation, but you'll be happier for it.", "You're not the asshole for feeling like you do, but if you start making a big deal about her Starbucks she's likely to start hating you, and since you're the bread winner she has you over the barrel, and I promise you she knows it.  Tread carefully.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re right, your wife is essentially embezzling from your joint account. Your arrangement is generous towards her in that she already gets twice more $ than you. Her taking money from your joint account for her personal needs is unfair and unreasonable. \n\nThe value of personal accounts is that the recipient can spend and allocate money as they wish without it affecting their partner or relationship. Your wife benefits from this in that you aren\u2019t questioning or criticizing how she spends her allocated funds. But now she\u2019s using your joint fund to supplement her own money & she should 100% be accountable for her use (as should you if things were different).\n\nTalk to your wife asap. With your new baby, you should both be looking to decrease extraneous spending - not increase it.", "Embezzlement? Seriously? YTA! Love and support your wife. Buy her a freaking coffee. She\u2019s a stay at home Mom. There\u2019s so little reward in that. You\u2019re being insulting.", "NTA; but I think it\u2019s worth having the money conversation with a trained, 3rd party mediator. I know for me money was such an emotionally fraught issue that conversations about it were EXTREMELY difficult, nigh impossible. I\u2019d shut down, cry &/or become defensive, regardless of how gently they were approached. I think engaging the services of a professional who can keep the conversation on track would be wise & worth the investment.", "NTA. yall need to sit down and have a conversation about what these accounts are for. her personal account is for her treats, the joint account is for necessities, baby stuff, and luxuries you enjoy together. i believe coffee at starbucks might be joint account, but sephora and creator subscriptions are definitely personal. these are details you need to discuss together. i also dont think its fair at all that her personal account is funded 2x yours. like...why?", "There is no conflict here. Wrong sub, go to r/relationshipadvice", "I MAY be out of pocket here but my brain says if I\u2019m a Sahm the only account I should have any access to would be where my allowance goes why does she have access to the joint account if she not putting anything in it for bills or such. I\u2019m genuinely confused and I\u2019m a woman before some one calls me a hating man or something I don\u2019t understand", "NTA don\u2019t focus on words like extravagant or what she\u2019s spending on. Focus on her spending outside of your agreed upon personal budgets. As a soft touch up oh can start by reviewing your goals and budget together. Let her see the state of the household herself", "NTA.\n\nYour wife forced you into the role of sole-breadwinner without any kind of agreement on your part. \n\nIt's financially abusive when she has money for Starbucks, Sephora, and an expensive tattoo, but you have to ride a bike in the snow because you can't afford an Uber.", "NTA. It\u2019s not an easy topic but it\u2019s very reasonable for you to be concerned about personal spending from a joint account that\u2019s not for that purpose since there already is an account for that purpose. If she won\u2019t bring it up, you should.", "Nta. Sit her down and have a discussion about how you think she may be abusing joint funds for personal use instead of using her personal account for that. Then discuss all the charges and which ones should or should not be personal and ask her if she can start only buying those with the personal fund. Maybe the line is luxury, but can get fuzzy if for example it is a basic need like food/coffee/snacks, and she might argue that other things are basic needs too, so hear her out and then discuss why you may disagree on some items. If she needs more money than what she is currently getting then she needs to ask.", "This.  Have you adjusted the household budget at all to accommodate for the baby?  Do you have a savings account for the baby's future education?  Is she spending money on the baby from her personal funds?  Maybe it's time for the both of you to sit down and reevaluate how much money goes into joint accounts vs personal accounts.", "But he\u2019s using the joint account for take out as well (\u201cdouble protein on my Chipotle\u201d). I think maybe it\u2019s that they have not defined \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cnecessary\u201d expenses. If he defines take out (probably at work) as necessary I can completely understand how a new mom can define a caffeinating break (probably while out and about) as necessary. \n\nI think this is more a NAH with a joint sit down about how they need to reallocate/redefine what they use money for. Because it does not seem like these conversations have happened yet. To make sure everything is accounted for and that reasonable but different assumptions don\u2019t turn into resentment. \n\nSince money is an uncomfortable subject, a financial planner that specializes in life transitions or a marriage counselor that does the same could be very helpful.\n\nOP, good luck if you read this. It sounds like you really love each other and your child and I promise it is worth it to have the uncomfortable conversations. And again, look into a facilitator to get you started.", "It sounds like she \"saved\" her personal money for the tattoo by using the joint account for her personal expenses, which is really not the same as saving up for a tattoo, because all she did was cheat the household for her own personal benefit.\n\nAlso, re: cutting both personal accounts, OP said that his is half the size of hers, so he's already cut his personal spending to benefit her, while she's sneaking money from their joint account to also benefit her. They have a problem, but it resides in OP's wife's spending habits, self-centeredness, and thoughtlessness.", "This. My wife didn\u2019t realize that she was spending $1k per year on Starbucks until I showed her the statements.", "Also, add to the conversation about setting up a fourth account for the kid w a certain amount going in every month.", "Yes, you both should have equal personal account money. I\u2019d also like to suggest something that works for me and my partner. We have a shared savings account and some of that money is allocated towards gift giving. For each other and family. Your personal money is mean to be spent on YOU. Decide together how much you want to spend of gifts for each other and take that money from a savings account, not your personal account.", "I agreed until I realized he's doing the same with Chipotle", "But then neither should his coffee and fast food/takeout.", "Yep. NTA, but communicate!", "I agree with you about the focus of the conversation - it needs to be on her use of joint account for personal expenses. \n\nI think OP is saying he uses his personal account for his Chipotle (and other that), but he doesn't have enough in his personal account to always go for the double protein, etc, because he's only using his personal account.", "I think the tattoo is worth mentioning if only because\u2026she \u201csaved\u201d for it? How? By using the joint account for small frivolity to better save for her big frivolity? It sorta feels like a slap in the face. And it makes a good point of \u201call of this should come out of your personal money, and if you want tattoos you need to cut back on Starbucks or wait longer to get it\u201d, etc", "I hope there are no childcare expenses, she doesn't work!", "She's not an AH for spending on frivolous nonsense from their joint account, without talking about it first, to save for a tattoo? How?", "And then when the crisis was over, she decided not to go back to work.  Funny that.  But OP, being a loving husband, doubled up her personal account, and now she is spending all that and spending on her own fun stuff from the joint account?  \n\nOP did not and seemingly still does not fully realize he has been turned into ATM, if only he'd been here reading these stories here daily he might have wised up before having a child with someone who will happily abuse him like this.  NTA but the conversation people are encouraging, while it needs to happen, is not likely to go well, her mental health may suffer not being able to go shopping with the other Starbucks moms...", "I wonder if you\u2019d have voted NAH if a guy was taking out money from a joint account to fuel a gaming hobby undiscussed where the wife was a sole breadwinner while spending the personal money for fun as well while bragging about it while the wife lives on scraps.", "He said she\u2019s recovered", "Gotta love how people deliberately misread posts to fuel their sexist beliefs.", "Absolutely right. She looks like a parasite from this text and the worst thing here that he allowed that happen and now there is nothing that could be done to fix this. She suck money and energy but don\u2019t give anything in return because she think it\u2019s just right, it\u2019s comfortable and it couldn\u2019t taken from her away.", "The callous tone towards male victims on this sub is astounding.", "Then Y T A. If you had bothered to read instead of making an assumption you would she he refers to them BOTH getting an allowance /fun money and despite her not working for 2 years!!! She got TWICE as much as him and now is STEALING money from joint account for Starbucks!!", "What are you talking about? He hasn\u2019t even brought it up yet. Why is asking her to plan finances out with him cause for divorce?", "Freaking cabelas for us. I counted up one year and almost had a stroke.", "Yes she did", "That's not what he is saying. OP is saying that the wife is pulling from the shared money. \n\nAs a result, they have less money there which forces OP to use his fun money for household things. \n\nIt isn't so bad that anyone is going hungry, but he doesn't feel good splurging on items like double meat at chipotle. \n\nOr put another way. Her use of shared money cuts into his use of fun money.", "Even if she doesn't work, she's allowed to have some child free time whether it's with a babysitter or daycare. When I was a sahm my son went to mother's day out so I could have some alone time to do what I wanted or even just go to the store unencumbered.", "Stay at home parents should get a break from their children on occasion. Being a stay at home parent is a lot of work and it's important to find a balance.", "Because woman who do something wrong should always be empathized with first and apparently cannot just be inconsiderate assholes.", "Tattoos and shopping says otherwise.", "Bruh, this is Reddit. Divorce is the first reply lol", "I uh spend a lot on GUNPLA. Like a shockingly high amount.\n\nBut I'm also a single dude whose only dependent has paws and loves belly rubs. So spending $1,500 a month on model kits isn't a big deal.\n\nI'd cut back on her spending amount to match OP's. Give them both the same amount. And lock the joint account.", "I don't think that's clear at all.", "\nI'm a mother,  I understand that. There still shouldn't be childcare costs outside of the occasional babysitter. That's what Dad is for.", "This probably shouldn\u2019t have been the permission I needed to buy myself a Gundam kit I\u2019ve been eyeing, but you know what? Happy Halloween to me. It\u2019s my first real one!", "Bro how are you spending $1500 a MONTH?! on gunpla. First of all I don't even understand how that's possible, that's like 8-10 p-bandai kits a month (or like 30 regular kits)? Do you just have entire rooms of your house that are filled up with backlog? Secondly unless you are making quite a lot of money that's entirely too much to be spending monthly on model kits (which basically lose all their value once built) no one should be taking any financial advice from you.", "Unless conversations, multiple, go poorly and there is no change, be shouldn't be locking the joint account.   That is a very, very close line to financial abuse. Sitting down to talk about the budget and what falls under what category should be the first step", "Then you should get tested for ASD", "My point was occasional childcare should not be considered mom's luxury. It's a necessity. And OP better not consider himself an occasional babysitter, he's a parent who is capable of caring for his child.", "They are very fun, relaxing, and easier to display than a puzzle haha. Have fun!", "Tons of P bandai plus I like to customize model kits a lot. Plus that's not including the other model kits I buy. \n\n\n\nI bring home north of $15,000 a month so the actual cost isn't that big of a deal. My monthly fun money budget is around $2,500.", "Looking at the comments I'm far from the only one who read it this way. Also yes, I'm autistic, no need to be a tool about it though.", "When I was a stay at home parent I met others like me and we traded with each other. That's how we got breaks. And it worked great.", "I make pearler bead things.  You know melty beads from childhood.  I haven't done it in awhile, but it's really relaxing for me.  I also crochet and get less shit for that when watching a movie than I do for just about anything else.", "Hate to say I told you so but...", "That sounds like a great idea!"]}
