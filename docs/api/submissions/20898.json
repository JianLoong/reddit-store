What non-creepy explanation is there for entering the bathroom she was in when she stated there was at least one other upstairs bathroom available?

Second it's not always... um... possible... to immediately jump up and close the door. To put it indelicately, sometimes you have to make a choice between someone seeing you on the toilet or trailing period blood and period shits to the door to close it quickly. Third, freezing when panicking is a known and common response.", "Okay. Let's say she has that. What's the excuse for him 1) violating a known house rule about coming upstairs, 2) doing so immediately after she told him she would be in the bathroom,  3) choosing her bathroom over the other one, 4) walking in if the door was open and she was in there? Even if for some reason he couldn't use he downstairs bathroom and needed to go upstairs, any non creepy person would have either used the other bathroom if it was urgent while she was in hers or waited until she came back and said, \"hey I know guests aren't allowed upstairs but I need to use the bathroom, is it okay if I use one of the upstairs one\". There's no non-creepy explanation here.", "More than likely the parents told him to go use the upstairs. While it is a rule in that house, the parents get to dictate when those rules can be broken.

But it shouldn't have come up because he shouldn't have been following her to the bathroom!", "She had the bathroom door wide open lol.", "> What's the excuse for violating a known house rule about coming upstairs\n\nThere's no evidence that \"no guests upstairs\" was a rule known to this person. \n\n>What's the excuse for choosing her bathroom over the other one\n\nYou're assuming that he chose HER bathroom. He went upstairs to use a bathroom. He had presumably never been upstairs before which means that he would be unfamiliar with the layout of the second floor. In my parent's house, for example, there is one bathroom downstairs and two bathrooms upstairs. The master bath can only be accessed by walking through the master bedroom which can't be reached without walking down the hall and past the other bathroom. \n\n>What's the excuse for doing so immediately after she told him she would be in the bathroom\n\nOP said that there were multiple bathrooms in the home which allows multiple people to use bathrooms at the same time. If a house has 3+ restrooms there's no reason to wait. As OP stated, this family friend was helping to repair a broken sink. If he were repairing a sink in the downstairs bathroom he would presumably need to use one of the upstairs bathrooms should nature call.\n\n>What's the excuse with walking in if the door was open and she was in there?\n\nAgain, she never said that he walked in the bathroom. Re-read the post. To her horror, she heard him on the stairs and he saw her naked. For this story to make any sense, those two things had to have been simultaneous. Which means he never walked in the bathroom. He may not have even gotten all of the way up the stairs. She didn't have to wait for him to leave. She just screamed and locked the door. To provide an example, at my parent's house if a naked person were standing in the open second floor (non-master) bathroom that person would be visible to anyone standing in the hallway.\n\nThis all means that it is entirely possible that this was a harmless accident. He couldn't use the downstairs bathroom. He was going to use one of the upstairs bathrooms not necessarily the one that she was in. He saw her without ever entering the bathroom. Had the door been closed he simply would have used the third bathroom.", "I fail to see how that means OP's dad didn't give him permission to use one of the bathrooms upstairs this one time.  This is especially likely given that he was there to help fix a sink which means they likely had to turn off the water to the floor the sink was on, meaning any bathrooms on that floor would be unusable.", "Closing the door is a good idea.

That means that water most likely would have been turned off.  Maybe not to the whole house, but at least to the floor the sink is on, which clearly isn't the upstairs since OP's dad didn't mention anything about the bathroom not working.  That means any bathrooms downstairs probably wouldn't be working.  If Kevin needed to use the bathroom, would he be breaking the house rules if OP's dad said \"sure, use the one upstairs in my bedroom?\"\n\n>and WALK INTO her bathroom\n\nI don't know how else to explain this to you.  If a bathroom has an entrance in the hallway and that door is wide open you don't actually need to walk in to see what's going on in there.  You'll see it, whether you want to or not, by just walking down the hallway.

That is a hard and very good thing. Do not let your parents change your behavior. Continue to speak up if you feel someone is crossing boundaries. If you think this was on purpose, I think it would also be very reasonable to not let him hug you anymore and to not want to be alone with him. \u201cI\u2019d rather not hug.\u201d Is a reasonable and perfectly acceptable response.

Depending on where the water shut offs are in the house because nearly every house is different it's possible that one bathroom may have been the only one with water.

Very disturbing.", "NTA. Family friend sounds really creepy.", "Here\u2019s the thing. It very well could be that the guy was being a creeper, but it\u2019s also possible that other circumstances were at play. I\u2019m wondering how much time went by, and if Dad gave the okay to use a bathroom up there.  It sounds kinda like the father did give the okay, in which case OP didn\u2019t want to hear it as it goes against what she knows.\u201d\n\nAgain it\u2019s possible he is a creeper, but it\u2019s also possible he\u2019s not.

But I think plenty of people are showcasing the *possibility* that he was walking by there for legitimate reasons too. \n\nI can\u2019t give judgement until I know more. I don\u2019t blame OP for doing what she normally does, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s nothing against OP\u2019s actions as that is the normal routine for them, but it\u2019s more wanting to know more info in regards to HIS actions.

These are not questions for you, but for your parents and Kevin.\n\n- How did Kevin know which room in the upstairs was yours?\n- How did Kevin know that your room has an adjoining bathroom?\n- Did Kevin enter other bathrooms before yours? What was unsuitable about those rooms?\n- Why didn't Kevin knock and ask permission before entering a teenage girls bedroom?\n- Why didn't Kevin knock on the **closed** door of a bathroom after already entering your bedroom?\n- When you announced that you needed to go to the bathroom, why didn't Kevin say something like \"I have been holding something in for a minute. Do you mind if I use the bathroom first? It won't take long.\"\n- Why did Kevin even ask why you're suddenly leaving the room? He was in your house to fix the sink, not hang out with you.\n- Kevin is an adult man. You are a teenage girl. Why do you have to be more responsible than him? Or \"smarter\" then him?\n- If Kevin thought that he did nothing wrong, why did he leave? Why did he not confront you and say \"I'm not rude\" in the moment? Leaving is suspicious. And if he was right but is so emotionally fragile that he cannot tolerate a yelling teenage girl, then what does that say about him?\n\nFor the record, I think you did nothing wrong. Kevin's behavior was highly inappropriate. In general, its not great to yell at people who aren't in immediate danger. But you have a right to tell when your own safety is threatened, especially if the person is in your private space and alone with you and you are a teenage girl.
