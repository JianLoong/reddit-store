I highly doubt the only working bathroom in the house at that time was the one with at least 1 entrance in the kid's room.  You really think the parents don't have an en suite bathroom here?\n2. Odds are he would have had to walk passed that bathroom to use the en suite bathroom in the master bedroom.\n3. Odds are, since he was there to fix a sink, that they had to turn off the water on the floor the sink was on (I'm assuming they're able to turn off the water for only specific sections of the house given no one told OP the bathroom upstairs wouldn't work).  That means any bathrooms downstairs probably wouldn't be operational.", "Okay let's say she has that. What's the excuse for him violating a house rule to go upstairs? Immediately after she told him she was going to the bathroom? And then choosing the one connected to her room instead of a different, available one, despite knowing she would be in there because she had just told him? If he had to go super bad it wouldn't make sense to go to the occupied one. The only way it makes sense to go for the occupied one is if you are looking to walk in on the occupant.", "1. It's not defending a random pervert.  Given a surface level knowledge of common home layouts and OP's description of events, it's entirely possible that this was an accident.\n2. How do you know the guy didn't ask if there was another bathroom he could use and OP's dad said \"sure, there's a 2nd one upstairs\"?  How do you know he wasn't explicitly told to it's ok to go up there by OP's dad?", ">How do you know her father didn't give him permission?\n\nIrrelevant due to the fact the guy knew the upstairs bathroom was in use and decided to go up there despite the fact.", "He knew the bathroom was use in. Reading is FUNdamental.", "It\u2019s still her house. You can\u2019t blame her for a pervert following her around to peek at her. He knew she was there. No one is to blame but the \u201cfamily friend\u201d.", "There is a big difference in someone potentially catching a glimpse through a window or a family member seeing you accidentally than being home alone with a 42 yo man who followed you to the bathroom. She's unlikely to be an exhibitionist, she's probably just, like most teens, a little lazy sometimes and feel safe to be so in her own home.", "She was in her private bathroom of her own bedroom on a floor no one was supposed to be. The pervert followed her in while he knew she was there and had no reason at all to be there. She\u2019s not at fault even in the slightest.", "They were working a sink, which may or may not have been in the bathroom. And working on the sink may or may not have rendered the bathroom unusable. But lets say there was no operational bathroom downstairs. Let's say he HAD to use an upstairs one. And let's say he had to go so badly he could not possibly wait until she got back to let her know he needed to break the rule about guests upstairs. What non-creepy explanation is there for entering the bathroom she was in when she stated there was at least one other upstairs bathroom available? Immediately after she told him she would be in there. You can't use a bathroom while someone else in it, even if you're not trying to be creepy. You would head for the one NOT connected to the teen girl's room.", ">The horror on my face when I heard the sound of Kevin walking upstairs **and going to the bathroom I was in**\n\nOkay, first off she might have heard him on the stairs and thought until he walked into the bathroom that he was going for the other one, but still be nervous because he came upstairs at all. Second it's not always... um... possible... to immediately jump up and close the door. To put it indelicately, sometimes you have to make a choice between someone seeing you on the toilet or trailing period blood and period shits to the door to close it quickly. Third, freezing when panicking is a known and common response.", "Okay. Let's say she has that. What's the excuse for him 1) violating a known house rule about coming upstairs, 2) doing so immediately after she told him she would be in the bathroom,  3) choosing her bathroom over the other one, 4) walking in if the door was open and she was in there? Even if for some reason he couldn't use he downstairs bathroom and needed to go upstairs, any non creepy person would have either used the other bathroom if it was urgent while she was in hers or waited until she came back and said, \"hey I know guests aren't allowed upstairs but I need to use the bathroom, is it okay if I use one of the upstairs one\". There's no non-creepy explanation here.", "More than likely the parents told him to go use the upstairs. While it is a rule in that house, the parents get to dictate when those rules can be broken. Theres still quite a bit missing for this to be considered some sort perverted act. Also, OP even stated that she heard him \u201cwalking upstairs\u201d and then proceeded to yell at him. Guy didn\u2019t even make it up all the way from the sounds of it. Seems to me she got way too comfy with the rule and learned that maybe its best to always close the door to the bathroom whenever using it.", "Because it\u2019s a house rule and he\u2019s NEVER been up there before!", "\u2018Assumed\u2019.\n\nThere\u2019s company in the house, you close your door.", "I'm a married man and I own my home.  One of my bathrooms is on the top floor where the bedrooms are.  I know it is entirely possible that, if I have guests over, one of them could need to use that bathroom.  From the hallway in front of that bathroom you can see into my bedroom.  So, you know what I do if I need to change when I have guests over?  I close the fucking door.", "The big difference is that, in her our words, she changes in front of a window.\n\nIn some places, being visibly naked in front of an open window is illegal and can get you arrested. \n\nLeaving the bathroom door open intentionally while changing when other also live in the house is weird.", "I mean, she should have closed the door, sure. But it shouldn't have come up because he shouldn't have been following her to the bathroom!", "She had the bathroom door wide open lol.", "> What's the excuse for violating a known house rule about coming upstairs\n\nThere's no evidence that \"no guests upstairs\" was a rule known to this person. \n\n>What's the excuse for choosing her bathroom over the other one\n\nYou're assuming that he chose HER bathroom. He went upstairs to use a bathroom. He had presumably never been upstairs before which means that he would be unfamiliar with the layout of the second floor. In my parent's house, for example, there is one bathroom downstairs and two bathrooms upstairs. The master bath can only be accessed by walking through the master bedroom which can't be reached without walking down the hall and past the other bathroom. \n\n>What's the excuse for doing so immediately after she told him she would be in the bathroom\n\nOP said that there were multiple bathrooms in the home which allows multiple people to use bathrooms at the same time. If a house has 3+ restrooms there's no reason to wait. As OP stated, this family friend was helping to repair a broken sink. If he were repairing a sink in the downstairs bathroom he would presumably need to use one of the upstairs bathrooms should nature call.\n\n>What's the excuse with walking in if the door was open and she was in there?\n\nAgain, she never said that he walked in the bathroom. Re-read the post. To her horror, she heard him on the stairs and he saw her naked. For this story to make any sense, those two things had to have been simultaneous. Which means he never walked in the bathroom. He may not have even gotten all of the way up the stairs. She didn't have to wait for him to leave. She just screamed and locked the door. To provide an example, at my parent's house if a naked person were standing in the open second floor (non-master) bathroom that person would be visible to anyone standing in the hallway.\n\nThis all means that it is entirely possible that this was a harmless accident. He couldn't use the downstairs bathroom. He was going to use one of the upstairs bathrooms not necessarily the one that she was in. He saw her without ever entering the bathroom. Had the door been closed he simply would have used the third bathroom.", "I fail to see how that means OP's dad didn't give him permission to use one of the bathrooms upstairs this one time.  This is especially likely given that he was there to help fix a sink which means they likely had to turn off the water to the floor the sink was on, meaning any bathrooms on that floor would be unusable.", "Closing the door is a good idea. Not doing it in a private bathroom, connected to a private bedroom, on a private floor of the house doesn't make her an AH. Following a child into a private floor of the house, through their private bedroom, to their private bathroom while you know they are using said bathroom makes you an AH.", "The company knew to stay downstairs", "Very often, those bathrooms that are connected to a room that isn't the master bedroom are known as Jack and Jill bathrooms because they actually have 2 entrances, either between 2 bedrooms or between 1 bedroom and the hallway.  It's more than a little likely that this guy didn't have to go in OP's room to pass by in the hallway and accidentally see what was in the bathroom.", "Okay, let's say he didn't. He still had to violate the house rule, go upstairs to go to the bathroom immediately after she told him she was going, and WALK INTO her bathroom, which he should have known was in use because she had just told him it would be.", ">He still had to violate the house rule\n\nDid he though?\n\nKevin and OP's dad were fixing a sink.  That means that water most likely would have been turned off.  Maybe not to the whole house, but at least to the floor the sink is on, which clearly isn't the upstairs since OP's dad didn't mention anything about the bathroom not working.  That means any bathrooms downstairs probably wouldn't be working.  If Kevin needed to use the bathroom, would he be breaking the house rules if OP's dad said \"sure, use the one upstairs in my bedroom?\"\n\n>and WALK INTO her bathroom\n\nI don't know how else to explain this to you.  If a bathroom has an entrance in the hallway and that door is wide open you don't actually need to walk in to see what's going on in there.  You'll see it, whether you want to or not, by just walking down the hallway.  Shit, I've been in plenty of houses where an upstairs bathroom with the door open would be in plain view just from the top of the stairs."]}
