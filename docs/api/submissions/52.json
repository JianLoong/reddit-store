Parents shouldn\u2019t have to threaten their kids to make them behave. They need to be adults and deal with the screaming kid", "NTA. Wow, what an absolute shitshow of incompetent parenting. Their child's behavior isn't your responsibility, and your appearance shouldn't be casually exploited by strangers to scare the living daylights out of children. Good on you for speaking the truth to that kid.", "NTA What she did was completely unacceptable. She had no right to drag a stranger into the situation. I understand saying things like \"If you're not good, Santa won't bring you presents\" or \"If you don't stop misbehaving, you're going to have to eat brussels sprouts for dinner.\" But using a real person to terrify the kid? No, not okay. And on top of that, it's absolutely going to give people around you the wrong idea to overhear some mother referring to a you as a bad guy. Imagine overhearing only clippets of what she said? You could have ended up in a terrible situation, all because she doesn't have the sense to stick to the usual scripts for these sorts of situations.\n\nOn top of that, it's going to just teach the kid to stereotype certain physical attributes. Another major problem that is far too common in society.", "Huge NTA!\nWhy on earth would someone use a random individual as a threat to their children? To teach them that certain features are \u201cscary\u201d and to be afraid?\nGood for you for not going along with it.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, what is wrong with those parents who are threatening their children with being taken away??? Thats emotional abuse!!\n\nSecondly, what is wrong with those parents picking on a stranger and designating them as a 'bad man' because of ---- what?? The way they look??? Thats no better!!!\n\nYou did exactly the right thing. Whether that parent wanted you speaking to their child or not doesnt matter, because it was that parent who opened the door for that communication.", "NTA, that was incredibly rude of her to pin you as the \"bad man\" to frighten her own child.  It's up there with calling medical staff \"mean\" for giving shots or a medical procedure that isn't fun.  That's instilling needless fear into a child.  If she can't handle her own kid, then she needs to work on herself.", "NTA\nThis was an awful thing for her to do to you.\n\nI have kids and have never used a stranger to threaten them.  We teach to be careful of tricky people, not strangers.  Because sometimes strangers are the only people they can go to for help.  I've seen strangers run to rescue a woman being raped and a child drowning.\n\nIt's hard enough to find a lost child.  It's much harder if they're afraid of the people trying to rescue them.  I witnessed a child lost in Costco bury themselves in fabric and crouch in an 8 inch gap behind a pallet because he was so scared of all the strangers.  The child-you-encountered's parent was wrong.", "Nta. This mother was squarely wrong to use you, a stranger, to teach a lesson to her kid\u2026 and what was the lesson? That if they misbehave they get taken away? Way to create insecurity in the kiddo ma\u2019am.", "I have a 10yo, that even before my divorce, I basically raised solo, and you are NTA. \n\nThis parent drug you into her situation without your permission. At that point you had two options, show the child that you are not \u201cbad\u201d and that you shouldn\u2019t judge a person based on what they looked like, or reinforced what the parent said and picked up the kid and pretended to run out the door with them (obviously /s to the second option\u2026 said as a joke not as a statement of fact) \n\nThis parent was the AH. First involving you just because they can\u2019t properly handle their own child, and second using your size and choice in style to enforce a stereotype for what a bad person looks like. With that mindset in a child, they will go with a stranger who is clean cut and friendly\u2026 because they don\u2019t look like a \u201cbad guy\u201d\u2026 and who knows what could happen\u2026 or they could turn down help from someone good, just cause the way they look. (I see stories all the time of these big \u201cscary\u201d bikers who do all these awesome and wholesome things\u2026 escort child victims into court to help give them confidence to face their attackers, or even stop by a child\u2019s lemonade stand en mass to help the child raise money for a good cause.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019m a parent and I would never use a random stranger to threaten my child into better behavior! That\u2019s so inappropriate and you did nothing wrong by standing up to that woman.", "NTA - what lazy parenting. Rather than actually disciplining her child she made you into a boogey-man. You had every right to clear the air, especially since you were getting the stink eye from others. She just taught her child to stereo-type people based on appearances and not to listen to her.", "Mom of 2 here. \n\nYour friends with kids are batsh\\*t crazy if they think that's not something to check in public because a parent said it. No.\n\nSay you let that slide and then a kid gets hurt in your vicinity (because kids get hurt moving, being still, sitting, standing, jumping, even picking their noses!) guess who is getting investigated by CPS? You. So, no. No no nopity no. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - what the actual fuck.  I am so offended on your behalf.  And what horrible parenting!  I am so sorry this happened to you, I don't know I would have had the patience to not go off on the mother if that happened to me.", "NTA that is just not how to parent at all", "NTA. I am so sorry that mom did that to you.  As a parent, I would never use another person as a threat.  Sorry, your colleagues are wrong to say you should have played along.  I am blown away that the mom did that to begin with.", "NTA.  Absolutely NTA.  Parent of 2 children.", "NTA\n\nI would question whether that parent was actually capable.", "NTA that moms a jerk.", "NTA. \nAnd I'm a parent", "NTA. I sympathize with (some) parents who are trying to control a child in a public space with little success, but that doesn't mean you need to drag other people into it", "NTA. A simple ' Bugger off' should do.", "NTA - You should not be used as a threat for children based on your appearance and you shouldn\u2019t have to accept it and \u2018play along.\u2019 It\u2019s disrespectful to you. It was also disrespectful for them to tell you not to talk to their child after she tried to tell him/her that you was going to take them and you were just trying to reassure the child. She\u2019s the AH. \nAs someone stated in another comment, it also sets the child up not to trust certain type of people in situations where they might have to rely on strangers to help them.", "NTA.\n\nI have a kid, and thing \"the man\" or \"the lady\" are bullshit parenting tools.  Also, fuck her for saying \"bad\" and that you'd take the kid away.  That was never going to end in anything but terrifying an disregulated child.\n\nI say you could've gone further and still not be the AH.  When she said don't speak to the kid, you would've been justified to point out __she__ involved you.", "NTA. That women and all your married colleagues are too entitled. Smear your own damn reputation", "NTA. \n\nFuck parents for putting you in that position. How dare she use you without asking, and on top of that, then she asks you not to speak to her child?! She can get rekt. \n\nPS: Not to be an asshole, but I think you meant 'cue' instead of 'queue'. I've made that mistake a bunch of times, so now I tend to be more aware of it, sorry.", "NTA.  Seriously, WTF? She can't take responsibility for disciplining her own child (like threaten to take away a privilege), she has to create a bogeyman to terrify her kid?!? Who does that!?! That kid is going to need therapy.", "NTA.  And don't listen to those other parents.  I'm a parent I would never do that my child or a stranger.", "NTA, i used to despise when people did this to me as a cashier - do not make me part of disciplining your child - and this is worse.", "I can understand playing along but actual adults thought you were causing problems.
