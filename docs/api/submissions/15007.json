Your stepmom for taking that shot at you, your dad for not quashing it immediately, and you for escalating it. That said, I'd certainly back you up and tell you that you should take a hard pass on an apology. If she wants to play with fire, she's going to get burned.

This is obvious, and shitty. \n\nBut...\n\nAs an old drama student/performer/arts worker, you need a hell of a lot thicker skin about this industry. The fact you went there that quickly is pretty indicative of someone who is gonna struggle pursuing drama (without a pretty serious attitude adjustment). There will never be a shortage of people telling you pursuing drama is a waste of money, and a lot of them will be saying it from experience. The VAST majority of acting work is poorly paid. And all of that is still stuff you have to audition/beat other actors for. It's a lifestyle you pursue for passion and not money, and being sensitive about that will hurt you in the probably-not-that-long-run.\n\nAlso the fact you went to such a specifically cruel place isn't great of you. Sure she hit first, but you hit far harder than you needed to. I suggest some improv classes, they legitimately help you think a bit faster and smarter on your feet. As an actor you need to be able to tailor your responses to the situation really well and really fast.", "Gonna go with a gentle ESH\nI understand your annoyance but your comeback was a low blow  to go for. \nStepmother shouldn't be mocking you for what you're trying to do, dad should have shut her down.

Please stop*\u2019", "Play with fire and get burned. NTA imo, dont give what you cant take.\n\nSounds like the relationship is pretty sour to begin with, she should have kept her mouth shut.\n\nTo those saying she went too far or it was too much, well, if you have things that can be easily targetted, maybe dont start attacking others because some people, like op, will bite back", "Info: Is your dad making any efforts to get his wife to apologise to you?", "NTA she was fucking around\n\n[https://youtube.com/shorts/a6eEcNlA5KQ?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/a6eEcNlA5KQ?feature=share)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The (small number) of people from drama school who made it had both enormous levels of self belief and the thickest of skins.

NTA", "Sadly I agree. I did a drama degree at one of the best unis for drama, many students went on to a postgrad at drama school - most of the people on my course wanted to pursue it as a career afterwards. The level of talent was exceptionally high. Of the 100 or so people I knew across my three years a small handful have made that a reality but mostly not as actors - a couple are successful directors, a couple more run theatre companies. There\u2019s a few who are acting professionally, mostly theatre and a few small parts on TV / in film, and a stand up. I knew within a few weeks of starting that I would never be a professional actor - I am nowhere near confident enough to get through auditions and take all the knocks, certainly not compared to the people I was there with. And boy to people like to mock those pursuing drama generally. \n\nOP, you have got to be able to take a lot more flack than this without it getting to you. If you\u2019re serious about acting, consider auditioning for the best London drama schools after your degree. Competition is fierce and you\u2019ll be up against those like my former classmates who have already spent three years in an intensive course at one of the few unis that still offer that. I know a lot of people that went through drama school - intake is small and if you can get in there you have a shot.", "Well said", "NTA \n\nBrilliant \ud83d\ude02 loved it \u2764\ufe0f", "She\u2019s the stepmom, not MIL", "NTA \n\nfuck around and find out.

It wasn't too far if her mom was mocking her life goals", ">So because many people mock me it is fine?\n\n\nI feel like this is pretty obviously not the point I'm making.", "With what info we have, without adding in our own assumptions, a step mother mocked her drama classes and she in turn mocked that person's major life choices, joylessness, and probably incredibly rough early adulthood; not to mention essentially called her child (an innocent third party) a mistake. Surely we can agree one of the two of them hit harder.\n\nAgain, I love theatre. But she's not even being mocked for picking Drama at uni level life choices, she's being teased for drama classes she's taking outside of uni. That is a life choice, and not something that deserves to be teased, but not a life choice even close to the par of motherhood. Especially motherhood at such a young age.", "100% agree. And, speaking of shoes...\n\nI used to train staff for a large call centre, and one particularly cocky newcomer was making fun of my shoes - saying they were womens shoes. I just smiled and said \"just because you saw them next to your mums bed this morning doesn't mean they're womens shoes...\"\n\nNever had him try to trash talk me or anyone again. Going a little harder with your replies to BS is a good way to fire a \"warning shot\" without devolving into a full on war. OP is NTA in my eyes, step mum was provoking and got what she deserved."]}
