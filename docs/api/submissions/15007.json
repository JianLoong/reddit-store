The fact you went there that quickly is pretty indicative of someone who is gonna struggle pursuing drama (without a pretty serious attitude adjustment). There will never be a shortage of people telling you pursuing drama is a waste of money, and a lot of them will be saying it from experience. The VAST majority of acting work is poorly paid. And all of that is still stuff you have to audition/beat other actors for. It's a lifestyle you pursue for passion and not money, and being sensitive about that will hurt you in the probably-not-that-long-run.\n\nAlso the fact you went to such a specifically cruel place isn't great of you.

A LOT of people keep telling me that this is obviously a pattern of behaviour and the mother is essentially an abusive parent (which may indeed be true) but this specific clap back is still a line I don't think should have been crossed.\n\nPeople in this thread seem readily willing and able to make the somewhat logical conclusion that this is a single event indicative of the relationship, but that's kinda where we are leaving it. We're not looking at other parts of the post to fill in needed context.\n\nThis is a drama class outside of uni, and work. So while it's a very valuable and enjoyable pursuit  (legitimately everyone should do drama classes they have huge personal and social benefits) it's hardly a life decision as large as motherhood. So a clapback at motherhood is a bigger clap. BUT this may account for severity and repetition, fair. If this is a result of a constant barrage of abusive and hurtful comments from a step mother, it's far more warranted than a one off situation.\n\nBut not many people are focusing on how the clap back is essentially \"you *chose* to be a teen parent\". Becoming a mother at 19 is rarely planned, and as OP observed essentially destroyed her step mother's chances of a happy and self directed life. The insult people are cheering on here shouldn't be something people reach for. You shouldn't be kind to people in rough situations up until they are mean to you and then go all in on a pretty openly misogynistic and brutal putdown; not only shaming their lack of personal freedom, but bragging about your own in comparison. You can go other places with it. \n\nThe 'choice' to become a mother at 19, yeah *could* have been voluntary and planned. But as we can extrapolate this step mum being a dick on more than one occasion we can also extrapolate how hard unplanned teenage pregnancies are. And I think it's a dick move to attack people on their basis. Most people on Reddit have never seen days more blatantly demonstrating how hard abortions are to get, both legally and socially.\n\nI opened my first comment with a direct criticism at the mother because she was absolutely being an inarguable arse.

Why? Like, I'm not teasing, I genuinely don't get why what I said was inflammatory.\n\nI don't think calling someone's child a mistake and the reason for their joyless life is an equivalent comeback for having your drama lessons teased (which is a solid dick move, just in my eyes the lesser dick move if viewed in a vacuum without other compounding behaviour). I'm happy to talk that out, and I'm happy to have my mind changed. But please give me some reasoning so that I actually see the perspective to change my mind.

I actually went to acting school when my older daughter ( my husband and I just had our second, now that I am 31) . \nI moved from Guatemala to Germany ( and then the USA with my husband ) to go to an acting school there with a good reputation. \nLots of work . If your step mother didn\u2019t achieve her dreams, ist totally on her. I hope she doesn\u2019t blame everything on being a young mother. It\u2019s definitely hard, don\u2019t get me wrong but if you stop trying to achieve your dreams you will get resentful. We all need to make decisions and sacrifices in life. And it seems you hit the nail on the head. If that comment was so bad for her, you hit the right spot and she isn\u2019t happy with her life. Go for  your dreams, it\u2019s your life. If you go to a reputable acting school, you can most likely get a job. I went to the Schauspielschule Charlottenburg ( acting school in Berlin ) and could always get a job. It helped me so much, to have that education. I eventually got into healthcare but I\u2019ll never regret my years in acting. I was doing Theater mostly and Telenovelas in my home country. I still take occasional parts in Guatemala, when we are there and have a small recurring part in a local soap opera like three times a year wich is great fun and nice additional income. \nIf you graduate from a good school, you should be able to get hired. It\u2019s a misconception that it is super hard to get acting jobs. Yes, most people won\u2019t become big in Hollywood but many actors don\u2019t even want that. You can earn very good money  and keep your private life by taking smaller parts or just sticking to theater. Specifically if you are good at old language and classical plays, you will get hired. And if you want to do TV and movies, you have BBC in Britain, wich often takes young , fresh talents from theater, that was my first job, a minor role in a BBC historical show and opened me doors for other things. I never got famous or anything but if that\u2019s what you want, try it, you have zero to lose. In the end I had lots of travel, fun and a much better income than most teenage mothers and was able to buy a house in my twenties. That\u2019s not a bad outcome at all. And you don\u2019t have a baby, so you can put everything you have into your dream. We often regret the things we dodo. And impossible is only that wich we don\u2019t do.  Your Step mom doesn\u2019t even know what she\u2019s talking about. She probably thinks actors have to be super rich and famous or super poor. It\u2019s not true. At least not in Europe. She is probably resentful and envies all the possibilities you have. If she had a positive mindset , she could still achieve many things since she must be still quite young. Don\u2019t ever get her negative mindset. \nI am sure you can become an actress, if that\u2019s your passion. \nNTA", "amusing... NTA", "I\u2019m a step-mom, your step-mom was the asshole here, and I\u2019m willing to bet money that this is a pattern for her. I\u2019m sorry she was so rude, there\u2019s no excuse for that. I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re putting yourself through business school, it\u2019s smart to have a \u2018safe\u2019 and solid career path and great that you\u2019re also dipping your toe into something you\u2019re excited about on the side. And brave of you to put yourself out there to see where it goes! Good for you, I hope you enjoy it. \n\nYour response to your step-mom makes you look immature, it\u2019s more of a childish impulse to retort with a pissy insult. But I\u2019m sure most people understand why you were angry with her. I have a step-parent myself, and as I matured, I didn\u2019t care enough to be triggered by their remarks and I knew that snappy comebacks wouldn\u2019t accomplish anything; being unaffected and ignoring felt like a much bigger personal win. Hopefully you get to that point, as well.", "ETA. Your stepmother shouldn't laugh at your dedication to your interests. She shouldn't have mocked you or tried to rope your dad into making fun of you. That is asshole-ish and insecure behavior.  You can/should call that behavior out, and ask her not to speak to you in that way. It's awesome that you're working to pay for acting classes and pursuing your interests. \n\nBut you shouldn't have said what you did. You attacked what is probably one of the topics about which she is most sensitive and conflicted. Your stepmother probably had to give up a lot to take care of her kid at 18.  If I were in that situation, a huge part of me would resent people who got to grow up slowly and explore their life (and a darker part of me would probably resent my kid). But I would also feel terrible for resenting my kid/others. Someone throwing that at me in a fight would break me (for a while at least).\n\nMy opinion on how you should move forward is this: Apologize to your step-mother. Be as honest as you can while trying to convey that you said something awful in a heated argument. If it feels like it won't cause another argument, you could also add that, while you know it doesn't excuse what you said, you felt so angry because acting is really important to you, and something you are passionate about pursuing. \n\nAll of this advice goes out the window if your stepmother has a pattern of making fun of you, pushing you to a breaking point, then playing the victim. I'm hoping this is a one-time argument you can both move past. Wishing you the best of luck <3", "YTA slut-shaming might feel good but it does make you TA.
