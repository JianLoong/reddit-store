Since we've moved in my roommates have all gotten into relationships, and as of September 2022 have all moved out. We are all listed on the mortgage and we still split the payments, I pay 50% and all utilities and they split the other 50% between them. Apparently they got together, without me, and decided that they no longer want to pay for a house that they aren't using (though they are still able to, as they all still have their rooms furnished, and have keys to the house.)\n\nWhen they told me about their plan, I refused. I still live in the house, and don't have the means to switch to renting. I even offered to pay more of the mortgage, 70% instead of 50, so their financial burdens would be less. They told me that we should handle it democratically and since it's 3-1, I'm outnumbered and should submit. They told me that they were researching realtor in the area and once they decided on one, they would be listing the house. It's a nice house in a great location and would definitely sell quickly.\n\nI know legally they would need me to sign off on the selling, since I am on the title, and a legal owner, but Am I The Asshole for holding out?", "created_utc": 1679699352, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12129p8/aita_for_refusing_to_sell_a_house_i_coown/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it wasn\u2019t it\u2019s a tricky one.\n\nCould it be an option for you to just buy them out entirely? Appreciate that may not be within your means. It could be worth sitting down and having a discussion with them around their reasons for wanting to sell. Like do they just not want the responsibility, is it financially straining etc. That way hopefully through communication you guys can come to some kind of agreement/compromise.

It was inevitable that different people would want to leave at different times, and you all should have agreed (and had made legal) the number of people required to trigger a sale, the mortgage burden of those not living there, etc. Not very helpful to your present situation, I know, but still... you'll know for next time.", "No one is the Asshole here.  Yet.  This is a business decision.  Pure and simple.  You have two options.  The first one is to sell with them.  Since you still live there, I doubt this option sounds good.  Your second option is to buy their parts of the ownership.  This means that you will take full ownership and the full mortgage will be your responsibility.  And if you can't afford this, then your only option is left to sell.  Not only would it not be fair to them to keep paying for a house they don't live in, but they could also make a profit from selling the house.  You could keep refusing to sell the house.  But at that point, they will likely lawyer up and a court will force you to either take full ownership (after paying your roommates a price everyone agrees on) or sell along with them.

Presumably if the other borrows don't cover those payments, the lien holder foreclose.

I guess the lesson is don\u2019t buy a house unless it\u2019s with a spouse.", "In a way, I did see it coming, but we always talked about how, if we all moved out, we would use it as an income producing venture. In hindsight, it definitely wasnt a wise choice, but I certainly didn't see it coming to this conclusion.", "You're right I have no clue what I'm doing, I don't have a lawyer, I was confronted at 4:30 and called a real estate law consultant and she tried to give me as much information as she could in as little time as possible as the firm had already, technically, closed for the day.If I had the proper knowledge I wouldn't be in this situation in the first place, as other commenters have told me.", "Potentially, I'll have to take the weekend to figure out what I want, and then take those steps later.", "Also depends on how long you've had on time payments and any changes to your credit.

It was an investment from the start and you\u2019re making this more about your personal needs.

Please explain as I\u2019m obviously not aware how it works! \n\nMy understanding was that if you own something 50/50 (e.g a married couple who owns a house together) and they sell due to divorce or what not - the money gets split 50/50.

Not pay them 400k cash.", "You know it's true because it rhymes", "Yeah, that is fair. It was eventually an income property, which makes perfect sense. Too bad it wasn't laid out in writing, once significant others get involved, it adds another opinion. \n\nSeriously though, see what you can swing and offer them what is fair, considering the ease of selling to you. \n\nIf not, take the profit. It is a huge win, and the housing market can easily crash, and this may happen in the current economic downturn.", "So when you wrote that you spoke to a lawyer, that was not true? You need to start looking at whether or not you can refinance by yourself and buy them out (it sounds like you can\u2019t). If that\u2019s the case you need to see if you can find a new co-owner who will be on the refinance with you (you can always buy them out down the line as well), or you need to consider the actual option of selling and walking away with your share of the proceeds. Don\u2019t let it get to them forcing a partition sale.

In a property arrangement where they aren\u2019t married the person who paid more into the house owns more than the people who paid less.", "Which is why I suggested finding out the motivation for selling. If they need their cash now they need their cash now. OP has to sell or buy them out. \n\nBUT if they just want to stop paying every month it opens many other options. Their mortgage payment can\u2019t be more than $500/mo if they bought for 68k. If the house is worth 320k than a room rental in the house would have to be at least $500/mo. If they get three roommates at $500/mo.

I\u2019m not saying yours didn\u2019t, but given that they didn\u2019t remotely mention a partition sale to you, I urge you to seek out advice from a different law firm in the future.", "Thank you.", "Okay, good to know, also in her defense she may have mentioned it, but again she was trying to shove a lot of info in a small amount of time and I may have just not heard it. Thanks again for the advice, I'll get a few opinions either way.", "Could you afford to buy their shares? It is understandable that they don't want to pay for a house that they don't live in anymore.

Your friends are effectively subsidising your housing situation at the moment. They are no longer willing to do this.\n\nOP can easily afford the mortgage on the original loan of about 60k. The problem is that the house is now worth about 400k. So to buy out the house, OP has to borrow another 300k (likely at much higher interest rates). I\u2019m doubtful that OP can swing this even with flatmates. \n\nIf you sell the house, my estimate is you\u2019ll come away with about 85k. Use that money to buy a house you can actually afford. As an added bonus, you\u2019ll hopefully hang on to your three friends.", "Forgetting the legal stuff, I'd say YTA.
