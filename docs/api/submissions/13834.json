She tends to curse and swear alot.\n\nI come from a family where nobody ever cursed(yes, I recognize the irony of posting in a subreddit with a title that references the AH word), as such, I am someone who never curses in their daily life at all, so it was a bit shocking to hear how liberally my wife would use the f word if she got annoyed or mad.\n\nFurthermore, if we were to have kids, my wife's frequent swearing might be a bad influence on them, and it's just not a polite thing to do!\n\nSo yesterday, I spoke to my wife and explained to her that I was concerned that she was swearing too much. I told her that I know she isn't dropping f bombs every few sentences or anything like that, but the fact is she does tend to curse alot, and it may not be a good influence when we have kids and she gets accustomed to the habit. I brought a swear jar, and told her to drop a quarter in it every time she says any curse words, so that slowly she can wean herself off of it.\n\nHer response was to loudly accuse me of being a f\\*ing dumb\\*\\*\\*, and that I was behaving incredibly childish.

News flash: they also curse. \n\nC'mon man.  I didn't let my kids curse when they were little.  The first time we heard one of them say a curse word, we explained that some words were for adults only. \n\nBTW, my parents didn't curse a lot in front of me.

I had to swerve down into a deep ditch to avoid getting hit by the dropped car. I yelled \u201cMother F\u2019er\u201d and the next thing I knew my kid called my other kid a mother f\u2019er. After I took a break (to cry laughing and call a tow truck) I explained that it\u2019s not appropriate for kids to swear in front of adults and they shouldn\u2019t teach those words to friends either. Because the reality is, almost every kid out there is going to swear, just because they think it makes them sound grown up and cool. So, they need to learn the appropriate situations where it\u2019s okay and it\u2019s not okay. When they were teenagers, they thought it was stupid that I knew they swore around their friends, their dad and I swore at home, but they weren\u2019t allowed to. I told them that I needed them to understand that there is a time and a place for everything. I can\u2019t swear around my clients, they can\u2019t swear around me.

The basic idea being that words are innately neutral but can be used to hurt, and we don\u2019t use words to hurt. So we can swear but we don\u2019t swear AT people, we can swear at home, but if we know grandma doesn\u2019t like swearing and we still swear around her that\u2019s disrespectful, etc. That\u2019s a bit more nuanced I think and would be a better fit for older children I think. Your rules sound perfect for a little one. \n\nOurs is 19mo and honestly I could count on one hand the number of times he\u2019s said a swear word (all of them repeating after me while I was gaming- whoops!) but we\u2019re definitely approaching the point where we\u2019ll need to find our approach haha", "I gave my son a similar context and he was given permission to swaer on the case of accident.  Whenever he skinned a knee or such he would very carefully select a word.\n\nAs he got older he would ask permission to swear before proclaiming something fucking awesome or such.", "My rules for swearing once the kids are a little older and can understand more nuance:\n- not AT anyone\n- not at school\n- for fuck's sakes don't let your grandmother hear you or she'll kick my ass\n\nThey generally don't, at least not where I can hear them, but I'm not going to go nuclear if I hear it.", "LMAO thats honestly beautiful. I can imagine the \n shock of whatever adult was in range of that \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, my dad swore around us growing up (my mom doesn\u2019t swear) and it was fine. We were taught they\u2019re grown up words and never repeated them until we were older. Now we all swear but all turned out fine. I do watch what I say around my nephew and niece as they\u2019re young and my niece is at the repeating all the words stage.", "This made me laugh, but seriously she needs to leave this man.", "Sorry completely misread your comment! Yes looking back it at the way she handled it, it was quite funny. I honestly thought I was a goner as soon as I swore in front of her. My older brother casually said \u201csh*t\u201d in front of her like 2ish weeks before and it was instant scary mum voice with no warning and she said something like \u201cBECAUSE YOU THINK YOU\u2019RE ALLOWED TO SAY SH*T, YOU CAN GO AND SCRUB THE SHITTER (toilet)UNTIL ITS SPARKLING\u201d\n\nThen when my brother left to go clean the bathroom, she turned to me and said \u201cdarling what do you want for dinner tonight, your brother doesn\u2019t get to chose tonight because of his behaviour\u201d. The fact that she could go scary mum to nice and sweet mum in seconds it\u2019s what I think made me try and be on my best behaviour as much as possible. So her reaction was unexpectedly funny.", "Yes this is exactly my reasoning just way better than I could describe it.  My mother was a devout Christian but she had a sharp wit and an even sharper tongue she could make you feel like you were 3 inches tall without using a single cuss word.  Swears do not have a morality.  But people do.", "I told my oldest one time \"don't repeat what mommy says\" while driving with her as a toddler.... 13 years later she still doesn't but has been allowed to cuss as stress relief or about situations around me (it's only fair and she's a great student)\n\nMy second however heard f*ck while I was driving her to daycare as a toddler and spent the rest of the day saying \"duck\" making her teacher laugh. Sigh..... \n\nEach kid is different.", "I love Mama Cusses. \n\nI've taught my son (4) that, right now, swear words are \"mommy words\" because I know how and when it is okay to use them. He hears the words but knows not to use them now. When he is old enough to understand when they are appropriate and not to use them to hurt others or when they may offend others, then we can revisit the use of swear words.", "I\u2019ve met mamacusses! She is *SUCH* a sweet and wonderful woman oh my goodness!", "There actually wasn\u2019t- he ran and told on me lmao. I just thought it was like \u201cjerk\u201d but even jerkier!", "She sounds scary", "Absolutely. You can hurt deeply without using a single swear word, and you can use swear words for good. Words are for the most part morally neutral (obvious exception for slurs) it\u2019s how and when and where you use them that matters!", "Nah I don\u2019t think she really was, think she was just a standard British mum, my friends mums were the same. My childhood friends mum was more extreme than other mums,  her go to punishment for my friend was embarrassing them in public if they were out and about with each other, if they\u2019d bump into people she knew, she\u2019d get my friend to explain what he did wrong in excruciating detail and he\u2019d get \u201ctutted\u201d at by people which is a Brits worst nightmare.", "Damn"]}
