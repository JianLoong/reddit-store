I really hope this person that didn\u2019t pick up after their dog will forever remember this and will have learned their lesson. I have called people out twice now with similar behaviour and the amount of deflecting that they did was unbelievable. Even though they deflected and tried to make me the AH, all you can hope for is that they\u2019ll think twice next time and choose to not be an AH. People suck!\n\nIn case you\u2019re curious, these were my 2 incidents:\n\n1) Sitting on my patio on the second floor, I noticed a lady walking her dog and pooping on a neighbour\u2019s lawn. She then started walking away, so I shouted \u201chey, pick up after your dog!\u201d and of course she deflected and asked why I was watching her? She continued to walk away. \n\n2) Again, sitting on my patio, I could hear a kid very close by. I looked up and a kid was taking a piss in my garden! I told him to stop right away! His dad was at the end of the driveway so I told him what his kid was doing and how this is private property and that you can\u2019t go pissing wherever you like. He proceeded to tell me to watch my mouth and that he didn\u2019t know what his kid was doing? I made sure not to swear once because a kid was involved. Of course he walked away. \n\nAnyways, all you can hope for is that people will remember that moment and will think twice before being an AH again. They probably won\u2019t, but it\u2019s all you can hope for.", "NTA - This is actually great", "NTA, you\u2019re a hero.", "NTA, sounds like she had it coming", "NTA. \n\nI would've used the bag as a glove and threw the poo directly at her.", "Nta. Find out where she lives and put her dog\u2019s shit outside her front door", "YTA .. she\u2019s very rude and while personally I\u2019m disgusted by dogs owners like that, somebody needs to point out that had you actually hit her you could\u2019ve been charged with assault. Please come up with a better way. Maybe a slingshot from a covert position. \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit: TTTF", "ESH.\n\nBeing an AH and not picking up is not OK. Nor is assault by means of a poop bag.", "ESH. Don't bring yourself down to their level.", "NTA", "NTA. Motion activated sprinkler. Get one and give her a wet surprise...", "It\u2019s frustrating for sure! And sadly it\u2019s a case of 1% ruining it for 99% of the population. Homeowners don\u2019t trust others to clean up.", "Yea that\u2019s considered assault", "I offered them a bag up front! And after they started walking away. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not the asshole here but they had ample opportunity to remedy their action.", "I would admit that I did it. I also understand that it wasn\u2019t the best way to handle the situation.\n\nI think the anger point for me was that she flat out lied. She had no intent to clean up after her pets.\n\nThe yelling match was pointless. I 100% agree with that.", "Sorry my dude, I just don't believe throwing shit at people, bagged or not, is acceptable human interaction.  I get that folks on this sub are revenge oriented but sheesh.", "You're  still that asshole. I've forgotten bags when I walk my dog and when I do I return home grab a bag and come back and pick it up. If you thew dog shit at me you would probably wish you didn't. Idk how you live in a world where you assault someone for a minor infraction and think you are justified. Grow up you do not exist to police society. \n\nHUGE YTA", "Hey, you were just returning something she (her dog) dropped", "The don't get in a yelling match. Throwing the shit just makes you a shitty person.", "I offered her a bag twice! Wouldn't you take the bag if you didn't have one? I would've saved you the trip back home!", "Then report her but someone being filthy and discourtious is not as bad as assaulting someone not to mention if they had decided to respond to violence depending on where you live it might even be lawful, at the least there would be an argument for it to be lawful. That lady's offense results in a fine yours can result in jail. Grow up and stop acting like a ridiculous vision of the neighborhood watch."]}
