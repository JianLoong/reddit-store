I really hope this person that didn\u2019t pick up after their dog will forever remember this and will have learned their lesson. I have called people out twice now with similar behaviour and the amount of deflecting that they did was unbelievable. Even though they deflected and tried to make me the AH, all you can hope for is that they\u2019ll think twice next time and choose to not be an AH. People suck!\n\nIn case you\u2019re curious, these were my 2 incidents:\n\n1) Sitting on my patio on the second floor, I noticed a lady walking her dog and pooping on a neighbour\u2019s lawn. She then started walking away, so I shouted \u201chey, pick up after your dog!\u201d and of course she deflected and asked why I was watching her? She continued to walk away. \n\n2) Again, sitting on my patio, I could hear a kid very close by. I looked up and a kid was taking a piss in my garden! I told him to stop right away! His dad was at the end of the driveway so I told him what his kid was doing and how this is private property and that you can\u2019t go pissing wherever you like. He proceeded to tell me to watch my mouth and that he didn\u2019t know what his kid was doing? I made sure not to swear once because a kid was involved. Of course he walked away. \n\nAnyways, all you can hope for is that people will remember that moment and will think twice before being an AH again.
