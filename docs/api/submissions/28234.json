We were talking about are previous relationships and flings. I told her I use to be quite a \"ladys man\" and would often get numerous phone numbers on nights out. She didn't believe me but I told her that it wasn't a lie. She then suggested a bet. Whoever could go out onto the street and get someones number first would win and the loser would have to buy dinner. At first I was hesitant about the idea because I didn't want either of us to be getting anyone elses number. But she assured me that it would be fine and we wouldn't actually be doing anything wrong because it was a little game. So I thought okay then. We went off and had to meet each other back at the car after 30 minutes. I still had that old charm in me and came back with 4 numbers. I returned to the car with a grin, but I noticed my girlfriend was there with a very sad look on her face. I asked how many numbers she got and she got zero, I told her I had gotten 4 and when she heard this she became very upset and wouldn't talk to me. I took us home and she went straight to our room and shut the door. The next few days she wasn't talking to me very much and finally I had enough and told her to sit down with me. I told her to tell me how she feels and why she is so upset over the game she said was just going to be fun and not serious. She told me she didn't think I would get any attention and that she would at least get one number, but when I came back with 4 it hurt her because she thought that I could go and get anyone and she is easily replaceable. I reassured her that I didn't want anyone else and she shouldn't worry. I told her that I love her and she is the only girl for me. This eased her for a day but she went back to not talking to me again. So AITA?

But also I've always been of the mindset that it is better to be wanted than to be needed.  You dont need to be with her, you choose to be, and that is much more commentment.  Every day you could go out get someone's number and start a new relationship, but you choose not to.  Shows a stronger relationship in my opinion.", "NTA.\n\nJust an FYI to everyone else: FAFO.   \n\n\nOP's SO did...", "Nta-your GF is insecure (most of us are).", "NTA. She wanted to play the game, hated the outcome. She reminds me of one of my exes. Toxic and dramatic, all of her own doing.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to recognize when your girlfriend is setting up a trap for you.  Just say no.  I saw a reel that the girl was asked if her partner gave her a no questions asked pass for one night who she would hook up with, she named several celebrities.  When the same question was asked to her boyfriend, he said nobody, that is a trap.  Just a lesson to learn OP. \n\nNot all women set traps, but it's better to err on the side of caution.", "NTA", "So her plan to belittle you by getting numbers from men, sure of herself that you would get none and be emerassed while she could brag, backfired. She tried a power play and failed. Thats kind of a red flag. This game was never meant to be \u201cfun\u201d but emasculate you. And now she is pulling the silent treatment. Is this a person u really want to be with? Nta", "NTA the game was her idea, she should've considered what might happen if you did get someone's number\u2014 which you did. You said you got rizz so go rizz her up, this is small problem, resolve it before it turns big. Just say \"I can get others but I chose to be with YOU so what are you afraid of\" bring out fictional men charms XD", "NTA she is butt hurt she lost. She is the one who insisted. Though you could have just gone out and did nothing and told her you got no number. It wouldn't have cost you anything to let her win in this case it would have been a tie., which would have been a win win.", "NTA. Just tell her it was only a game. You still love her.", "NTA but man I hate to see people falling for these stupid games and questions. Probably should have just told her you got one number but I think it falls into the category of don\u2019t ask questions you don\u2019t want answers to.", "Come on, dude. How exactly did you think this would play out?", "NTA but you should've known this was a trap lol", "Nta but did she answer first? If so life lesson bro, lie it\u2019s better to be happy then win especially if i could see my partner was sad and lost. It\u2019s likely this isn\u2019t even about the number you got, she is likely crushed she didn\u2019t get any. Reality sucks sometimes but damn despite a bet I would of lied. I\u2019d rather be happy then win. \n\nStill NTA", "NTA and she literally is telling you to your face that she takes you for granted. It\u2019s telling that she wants to be seen as the prize where she puts minimal effort in this relationship and you do everything to make her happy. Listen to what she\u2019s truly saying because you deserve way better than a person like that who manipulates you into a stupid game and then gaslights and ignores you. She\u2019s a bad human being objectively and you need to leave.", "If some dude bragged to me about how many chicks he could get in one night I'd say peace out.", "NTA but you are as sharp as a bowling ball.", "NAH.  umm I thought the winner was the first to get a number.  why did you keep going and get 3 more?  lol", "She wanted to show you that she was the settler and she found out you were.", "NTA but not so smart either. Your number should be the same as her. In that game only a tie makes you a winner.", "I'd be a little miffed that she basically admitted to you that she believes she's more 'marketable,' or attractive than you and was surprised you got any phone numbers. What's her deal? Is she with you because she's into you or because she always needs to have a partner? Do you feel like she thinks she's settling for you?", "ESH. The bet was who would be first. Not who got the most. You couldn't just stop after one?\n\nYou both played yourselves.", "NTA: She does get a Red Flag though. This is drama queen level stuff here.", "Is this a relationship that you care about? Why would you ever play this game? I really don\u2019t see what this would accomplish. It\u2019s a lose lose. The correct option would have been to self sacrifice and get 0 numbers. \n\nThis is the end of your relationship. She\u2019s checking out. at least you have those 4 numbers to fall back on now.", "ESH.  It's like playing 'truth or dare' and 'never have I ever', if you play that kind of game when you're in a relationship there's almost no way that the outcome will be good.", "ESH. This is a stupid game that would have ended up hurting both of your feelings in many outcomes. She shouldn't have suggested the game and you shouldn't have accepted.", "ESH. Stupid games get stupid prizes and all that. But at the end of the day, you knew it was a bad idea and did it anyways, and what she clearly wanted was some validation and reassurance, not a contest.", "You\u2019re NTA but you\u2019re an idiot. She\u2019s no better for even suggesting it though.", "Gentle ESH. When she told you her number first it would have been nice to discreetly get rid of the numbers you got and tell a white lie here. Something like \" whew, I didn't get any either, lets go treat ourselves to a nice dinner,\" would have been good. Her self-esteem took a blow and now she feels worthless to you. You didn't mean for her to get hurt but she did. However, even better would have been to not take the bet. \"Hey sweetie, you are all I need now. I do not want to see if there are other women interested. You are the only woman for me.\" Or \"I do not feel comfortable with this, I love you and do not want to compete with you.\" Things like this never go well. One of the participants tends to get hurt.", "ESH. You boasting about being a \"ladies man\" and her feeing the need to prove she can get guys' numbers too. You both brought this shitty situation on yourselves. Grow up.", "NTA but please have a little more emphatie the next time something like this happens. You saw she was sad and you had not the idea just to lie and say, that you couldnt get a number too?", "ESH. This was a stupid game that couldn\u2019t possibly end well.", "ESH -  You are both immature assholes.  Did the people who gave you their number know it was a game?", "I don\u2019t think you can say you actually won because you don\u2019t know if you got any REAL phone numbers or REAL interest.\n\nWoman will give out fake numbers or even their real number (and just block you later) to avoid an awkward and possibly violent reaction to rejection. \n\nAll you won was gender dynamics\u2026\n\nMen felt comfortable expressing their rejection and women did not, \n\nYTA", "YTA. Happy wife, happy life. Why would you wanna put her a position to feel insecure to stroke your ego? She\u2019s your girlfriend, not your bro.", "[deleted]", "NTA. She\u2019s the one who even suggested it and you were uneasy. I think she wanted an ego boost to make you feel the way she feels now which is sus in my opinion. Throwing an adult tantrum over it is also super strange.", "Her ego is bruised cause she couldn't pull any numbers and you could. MTA, but she shouldn't play games like that if she can't handle the consequences/results.", "> She told me she didn't think I would get any attention and that she would at least get one number,\n\nNTA She wanted to \"put you in your place\", and instead put herself there. This is not someone who respects you.", "Nta. She's being childish. She proposed the childish game, lost and is now pouting.", "NTA. And your girlfriend is with you while thinking you\u2019re not desirable? What? Seems like she chose you because she thought she would have some kind of upper hand in the relationship.", "Nta. She seems very immature.", "Acting like getting numbers from men and women is an even game too is hilarious. She was playing on easy and lost to a master of Rizz. Fucked around, found out", "NTA, the fact that you could and don\u2019t should be reassuring, not problematic. \n\nYou know how you feel about her and the general quality of the relationship. I wouldn\u2019t waste my time with a childish game player like her. There will always be some bs question or TikTok test you have to pass.
