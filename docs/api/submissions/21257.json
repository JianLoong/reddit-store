I have met and visited his family numerous times. They're lovely. His family asked us to visit them for a week to celebrate the 4th of July.\n\n\r  \nI declined. Here are my reasons:\n\n\r  \nI have been vegan since birth (vegetarian family + lactose intolerance). I have no desire to eat meat. My bf and his family are voracious carnivores. I have no issue with this. My diet preferences are mine alone. That said, every time we visit his family, I am left to fend for myself regarding food.\r  \n\r  \nHis parents make three-course meals and barbecues for everyone, and not even a single item is made vegan. The salads have bacon in them. Roast potatoes are cooked in lard. Rice is cooked with chicken stock. I always have to buy ingredients and then cook my meals. Because their fridge is packed to capacity with their food, I have no space to cook a large batch of food and store it, so I have to cook every day. This is exhausting, especially on a vacation. I have politely asked them if they could leave out bacon/chicken stock in salads and rice, and they agree, only to \"forget\" when the time comes.\r  \n\r  \nAnother thing is that his family is religious and doesn't want unmarried couples to sleep in the same bedroom. This means that I share a room with his sister A, and his A's partner shares the room with my bf.\n\nA married her partner of 2 years a few months ago, and they are now allowed to sleep in the same bedroom. But since we are unmarried, I was unsure what the sleeping arrangement would be like since they only have three bedrooms. I asked his parents about this, and they said I would need to sleep on the sofa in the living room.\r  \n\r  \nThis was when I checked out. This \"vacation\" is not even slightly appealing to me. I love his family, but not enough to give up every ounce of comfort. Staying in hotels is not possible since they live in a remote area without any hotels within 20 mi. I told my bf that I wouldn't be coming on this or any future vacations until they either fix the food or the sleeping situation (or both).\r  \n\r  \nMy bf insisted that I come and offered to sleep on the sofa. But I know that he has back problems and the mattress in his room is an orthopedic one, and sleeping on the sofa will fuck him up for a long time. I told him that I'd much rather save my time off for an actual vacation where I get to relax and enjoy myself without worrying about going hungry or not getting enough sleep. I encouraged him to go and spend time with his family without me, and he reluctantly went.\r  \n\r  \nSince yesterday, A has been texting me and implying that I was being a diva for not coming because of \"petty\" reasons. I was polite, but I held my ground. But a part of me is wondering if I am being an asshole since there was no other reason for me not to go except the ones I stated.\r  \n\r  \nIf I am being an asshole, I plan on driving over tonight to be there on the 4th.", "created_utc": 1688418362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14puuom/aita_for_refusing_to_vacation_with_my_bfs_family/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But my bf's family, once they learned about my diet preferences, always make sure they stock up on fresh veggies (in case I want to cook) and also make a couple of vegetarian dishes for me. They also want us to sleep separately, but they ensure that I have comfortable sleeping arrangements.\n\nWhat you described would be a dealbreaker for me too.", "NTA.

It sounds like more work than it\u2019s worth.", "Absolutely NTA. Being vegan is not a petty reason. Enjoy your time without the meatosauruses, lol, and maybe stop replying to his sister. There may be a diva in this story, but it isn't you. Have a happy 4th!", "NTA, you deserve decent food.

Perhaps your absence will finally land the fact that forcing you to cater for yourself at every meal actually is a problem.", "NTA. A vacation is NOT a vacation when you are miserable. The sleeping arrangements alone are unacceptable, let alone the complete disaster that is EVERY MEAL, and expecting you to tolerate this more than once?? Nope. No way. Life is too short to waste your precious vacation time enduring a shitty situation - no matter how lovely the hosting family may be. You have suffered enough for HIS vacation! If your bf isn't willing to compromise by staying in a decent hotel and ordering you some carryout restaurant food so that *you too* can have a pleasant experience, then I wouldn't bother to go EVER again.", "NTA - but you do realize they do this on purpose right ?\n\nThey want you to feel unwelcome so they can have your bf all to themselves and be in his ear all vacation long convincing him that you\u2019re a \u201cdiva\u201d for wanting basic comfort on supposed vacation.\n\nYou\u2019re defending your boyfriend way too much here.

It sounds like you respectfully informed your bf of your reasons and encouraged him to attend. Your reasons are entirely valid. I wouldn't want to waste my vacation days in that situation either.", "NTA. My partner has the same issue with my family. She is vegan and my family doesn't know how to eat vegetables. After 8 years they've started trying, but roasted zucchini and peppers isn't exactly a full meal. We've started bringing dishes for her when we have get-togethers. I'm positive you would feel limited in options having to cook daily when they're probably already eating.\n\nI don't blame you a single bit for drawing the line at sleeping on the couch when you could easily sleep with your bf, which I'm assuming they must know happens at home? \"My house, my rules, blah blah blah.\" It's asinine in this day and age to dictate sleeping arrangements. It was good of you to hold firm, and if anyone is being a diva it's A due to her petty texts. Don't drive there for the 4th. They may be nice and all, but you're still causing yourself discomfort unnecessarily.", "Nta. This should not be a problem \n-They made an offer and made conditions clear (well, food is iffy as they promise vegan options but always \u201cforget\u201d)\n- you evaluated and decided it wasn\u2019t worth the work and hassle of cooking every day and sleeping uncomfortably \nAll good.", "Kinda of an agile but if this triggers you it is best not to attend; it will only cause more issues", "NTA. Personally it doesn't feel like his family is accomodating to you at all. I wouldn't go either. If they know you have dietary restrictions, why can't they make even a single dish, or at least have fresh veggies, fruits, and other vegan friendly options available for you to eat? Not every dish needs to have meat or dairy products in it. Nothing wrong with plain rice made with just water and a few seasonings in a rice cooker...shit that's really easy to make and will accommodate your needs. You could bring your own food, but again that's not fair to you when food is provided to everyone else. What does your boyfriend think of all this?", "NTA. I don\u2019t blame you at all for not wanting to go.", "NTA. As a general rule, you shouldn't go places where you're made to feel unwelcome. You might like his family, but they pretty clearly don't actually like you. They are purposely failing to accommodate your diet. It is not difficult to leave bacon out of salads and cook rice with water or vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. When I have invited guests with dietary restrictions staying with me, I go out of my way to make sure they have suitable things to eat and don't feel excluded. And I'd never ask someone to sleep on a sofa. They can't even get you an air mattress or a roll-away bed? Or relax their ridiculous rule for a couple who's been together for four years?", "NTA-My sister in law is vegan and we always MAKE SURE to have food for her at every family event. If we don\u2019t have ingredients we even pay to order her vegan food so she isn\u2019t left out. We do this because we love her.\n\nHis family does not love you.", "NTA. (Vegan here as well; I completely get where you're coming from.) \n\nI don't think you're asking for much either. You're not asking for his family to not eat meat around you or change their meal plan entirely. They could truly be more accommodating and respectful towards you by either setting up some of the same salad to the side (without the meat) or putting the meat on the side. Simple things like this can go a long way. Or if they asked you if you wanted some Vegan 'hot dogs\" to include you in the BBQ. \nIt kinda comes across like they don't respect your dietary needs.\n\nYou don't come across like a diva. You just wish your boyfriends family could be more accommodating is all. \n\nIt's also okay to respect their religious beliefs in you guys not sharing a room so long as they respect your beliefs in being vegan. Relationships of any kind are give and take. \n\nSo I think if they were willing to accommodate you on the food, you'd probably be okay to not share a room with your partner. Yeah? But they weren't even willing to meet you halfway in this exchange and that sucks. \nIt's hard to have a vacation without food you can eat.\nI hope when your boyfriend returns home, you guys can have a healthy conversation about it. I'm sure there's a lot he doesn't understand about it either even though he's been dating a vegan for years.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I hate to say it, but you're making yourself a doormat for them & fooling yourself into believing you 'love' them.", "His family is making obvious statements about your lifestyle choices. I doubt it will change ever, so it\u2019s gonna be accept them bc they don\u2019t accept you unless you give in. They are pushing to stand their ground. Can you stand your ground against all of them? What happens when the little ones come? Will they try to make you look petty or foolish in front of your kids? And what if one child sides with you and another sides with them?\nObviously the bf has chosen sides. \nI think you are a solid person who has made solid life choices. I think you should keep looking. It\u2019s a lot less trouble in the long run.", "NTA, when I have guests, I feed them and put them in the most comfortable places to sleep that I can. \n\nIf I'm cooking for a large group, I *ALWAYS* make sure to include at least one thing that complies with their dietary habits. If they're vegetarian, guess what. They're getting one hell of a vegetarian dish. \n\nIf they're vegan, I do the best I can to make something that's at least edible, even if it may not be the most impressive food. I'm not very good at vegan cooking, I've tried. I made something once, and it was awful.", "Not sure that having food to eat and a bed to sleep on count as petty reasons. Seem pretty basic to me. NTA.", "NTA- my husband is vegetarian (I know it\u2019s not the same) and my family are very big meat eaters too but we still take the time to make sure HE has food he can eat that isn\u2019t contaminated by meat or byproducts. It\u2019s not hard to accommodate to make sure you have food to enjoy. \n\nIt was kind of him to offer the bed for you, and also considerate of you not to take it because of his back. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect someone to sleep on a couch for a vacation.", "Your points are valid. If I ever had a guest with dietary restrictions, I would do my best to accommodate them when I cooked. I definitely need to rethink my views.", "in the absolute most charitable read, these people are awful hosts. but i can\u2019t help but think even an awful host would remember op is vegan after 4 years. nta, this is icky behaviour from bf\u2019s family. a is part of the problem, and i\u2019m not convinced bf is not part of it as well.", "The very LEAST they could do is leave the toppings out of the salad so everyone can put in what they want.  It's not that difficult.", "My boyfriend has talked to them about it many, *many* times. He is not the problem here because he agrees with my concerns. But his family doesn't seem to care about this particular issue.", "My boyfriend told them why I did not come. It wasn't blabbing because I told him that he can be truthful (in case it helps change their ways in the future).", "People this obtuse may never get it", "Yes\n\nETA: His parents know we live together too. It's just a weird \"my roof, my rules\" situation.", "I completely agree. They are purposely and staunchly refusing to accommodate you food-wise. I'm not vegan or vegetarian, and I cook and entertain a lot. There are some very easy and delicious vegan dishes --bean salad, hummus and veggies, tapenade, grilled vegetables, etc. You can get plant based butter and nut milks and bake or have sorbet for dessert. There are vegan burgers and hotdogs. None of this is difficult or expensive.", "His family is very rude. My husband and I never really had anyone that had dietary restrictions. When my brother started dating his gf, he told me she\u2019s vegetarian. I made her some dishes at our party. It\u2019s the considerate thing to do and I\u2019d like her to come back lol.", "Then they don't care about you. Don't stress yourself worrying about people who can't be bothered to make even the smallest efforts for you.", "If he truly cared, he would stop begging you to attend and support your decisions to have an enjoyable vacation. He would tell A to stop bothering you about not attending. He would be sticking up for you.", "This is as bold as you need to be. They have to know that if they don't make you welcome, you don't feel welcome. After such an amount of time it's entirely on them to step up.", "It's wild to me that \"plant based butter\" is suddenly a thing. It's been a thing for a while, called margarine, and it was poor people food (for me and my family, we were poor lol)", "regular margarine usually has whey in it or other milk deprivatives in it actually and is not plant based at all especially the kind you probably ate growing up.", "Oh I had it as a kid, it was bright yellow and my Mom called it oleo. My hope is that the new plant based butters are lower in trans fats than oleo was.", "Trans fats have been the boogie man of the food industry for a while, so I'm sure they're a lot healthier than they used to be. And it's also easier to spread on toast than butter haha"]}
