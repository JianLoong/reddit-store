I have met and visited his family numerous times. They're lovely. His family asked us to visit them for a week to celebrate the 4th of July.\n\n\r  \nI declined. Here are my reasons:\n\n\r  \nI have been vegan since birth (vegetarian family + lactose intolerance). I have no desire to eat meat. My bf and his family are voracious carnivores. I have no issue with this. My diet preferences are mine alone. That said, every time we visit his family, I am left to fend for myself regarding food.\r  \n\r  \nHis parents make three-course meals and barbecues for everyone, and not even a single item is made vegan. The salads have bacon in them. Roast potatoes are cooked in lard. Rice is cooked with chicken stock. I always have to buy ingredients and then cook my meals. Because their fridge is packed to capacity with their food, I have no space to cook a large batch of food and store it, so I have to cook every day. This is exhausting, especially on a vacation. I have politely asked them if they could leave out bacon/chicken stock in salads and rice, and they agree, only to \"forget\" when the time comes.\r  \n\r  \nAnother thing is that his family is religious and doesn't want unmarried couples to sleep in the same bedroom. This means that I share a room with his sister A, and his A's partner shares the room with my bf.\n\nA married her partner of 2 years a few months ago, and they are now allowed to sleep in the same bedroom. But since we are unmarried, I was unsure what the sleeping arrangement would be like since they only have three bedrooms. I asked his parents about this, and they said I would need to sleep on the sofa in the living room.\r  \n\r  \nThis was when I checked out. This \"vacation\" is not even slightly appealing to me. I love his family, but not enough to give up every ounce of comfort. Staying in hotels is not possible since they live in a remote area without any hotels within 20 mi. I told my bf that I wouldn't be coming on this or any future vacations until they either fix the food or the sleeping situation (or both).\r  \n\r  \nMy bf insisted that I come and offered to sleep on the sofa. But I know that he has back problems and the mattress in his room is an orthopedic one, and sleeping on the sofa will fuck him up for a long time. I told him that I'd much rather save my time off for an actual vacation where I get to relax and enjoy myself without worrying about going hungry or not getting enough sleep. I encouraged him to go and spend time with his family without me, and he reluctantly went.\r  \n\r  \nSince yesterday, A has been texting me and implying that I was being a diva for not coming because of \"petty\" reasons. I was polite, but I held my ground. But a part of me is wondering if I am being an asshole since there was no other reason for me not to go except the ones I stated.\r  \n\r  \nIf I am being an asshole, I plan on driving over tonight to be there on the 4th.", "created_utc": 1688418362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14puuom/aita_for_refusing_to_vacation_with_my_bfs_family/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you respectfully informed your bf of your reasons and encouraged him to attend. Your reasons are entirely valid. I wouldn't want to waste my vacation days in that situation either.", "NTA. My partner has the same issue with my family. She is vegan and my family doesn't know how to eat vegetables. After 8 years they've started trying, but roasted zucchini and peppers isn't exactly a full meal. We've started bringing dishes for her when we have get-togethers. I'm positive you would feel limited in options having to cook daily when they're probably already eating.\n\nI don't blame you a single bit for drawing the line at sleeping on the couch when you could easily sleep with your bf, which I'm assuming they must know happens at home? \"My house, my rules, blah blah blah.\" It's asinine in this day and age to dictate sleeping arrangements. It was good of you to hold firm, and if anyone is being a diva it's A due to her petty texts. Don't drive there for the 4th.

Personally it doesn't feel like his family is accomodating to you at all. I wouldn't go either. If they know you have dietary restrictions, why can't they make even a single dish, or at least have fresh veggies, fruits, and other vegan friendly options available for you to eat? Not every dish needs to have meat or dairy products in it. Nothing wrong with plain rice made with just water and a few seasonings in a rice cooker...shit that's really easy to make and will accommodate your needs. You could bring your own food, but again that's not fair to you when food is provided to everyone else. What does your boyfriend think of all this?", "NTA. I don\u2019t blame you at all for not wanting to go.", "NTA. As a general rule, you shouldn't go places where you're made to feel unwelcome. You might like his family, but they pretty clearly don't actually like you. They are purposely failing to accommodate your diet. It is not difficult to leave bacon out of salads and cook rice with water or vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. When I have invited guests with dietary restrictions staying with me, I go out of my way to make sure they have suitable things to eat and don't feel excluded. And I'd never ask someone to sleep on a sofa. They can't even get you an air mattress or a roll-away bed? Or relax their ridiculous rule for a couple who's been together for four years?", "NTA-My sister in law is vegan and we always MAKE SURE to have food for her at every family event. If we don\u2019t have ingredients we even pay to order her vegan food so she isn\u2019t left out. We do this because we love her.\n\nHis family does not love you.", "NTA. (Vegan here as well; I completely get where you're coming from.) \n\nI don't think you're asking for much either. You're not asking for his family to not eat meat around you or change their meal plan entirely. They could truly be more accommodating and respectful towards you by either setting up some of the same salad to the side (without the meat) or putting the meat on the side. Simple things like this can go a long way. Or if they asked you if you wanted some Vegan 'hot dogs\" to include you in the BBQ. \nIt kinda comes across like they don't respect your dietary needs.\n\nYou don't come across like a diva. You just wish your boyfriends family could be more accommodating is all. \n\nIt's also okay to respect their religious beliefs in you guys not sharing a room so long as they respect your beliefs in being vegan. Relationships of any kind are give and take. \n\nSo I think if they were willing to accommodate you on the food, you'd probably be okay to not share a room with your partner. Yeah? But they weren't even willing to meet you halfway in this exchange and that sucks. \nIt's hard to have a vacation without food you can eat.\nI hope when your boyfriend returns home, you guys can have a healthy conversation about it. I'm sure there's a lot he doesn't understand about it either even though he's been dating a vegan for years.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I hate to say it, but you're making yourself a doormat for them & fooling yourself into believing you 'love' them.", "His family is making obvious statements about your lifestyle choices. I doubt it will change ever, so it\u2019s gonna be accept them bc they don\u2019t accept you unless you give in. They are pushing to stand their ground. Can you stand your ground against all of them? What happens when the little ones come? Will they try to make you look petty or foolish in front of your kids? And what if one child sides with you and another sides with them?\nObviously the bf has chosen sides. \nI think you are a solid person who has made solid life choices. I think you should keep looking. It\u2019s a lot less trouble in the long run.", "NTA, when I have guests, I feed them and put them in the most comfortable places to sleep that I can. \n\nIf I'm cooking for a large group, I *ALWAYS* make sure to include at least one thing that complies with their dietary habits. If they're vegetarian, guess what. They're getting one hell of a vegetarian dish. \n\nIf they're vegan, I do the best I can to make something that's at least edible, even if it may not be the most impressive food. I'm not very good at vegan cooking, I've tried. I made something once, and it was awful.", "Not sure that having food to eat and a bed to sleep on count as petty reasons. Seem pretty basic to me. NTA.", "NTA- my husband is vegetarian (I know it\u2019s not the same) and my family are very big meat eaters too but we still take the time to make sure HE has food he can eat that isn\u2019t contaminated by meat or byproducts. It\u2019s not hard to accommodate to make sure you have food to enjoy. \n\nIt was kind of him to offer the bed for you, and also considerate of you not to take it because of his back. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect someone to sleep on a couch for a vacation.", "Your points are valid. If I ever had a guest with dietary restrictions, I would do my best to accommodate them when I cooked. I definitely need to rethink my views.", "in the absolute most charitable read, these people are awful hosts. but i can\u2019t help but think even an awful host would remember op is vegan after 4 years. nta, this is icky behaviour from bf\u2019s family. a is part of the problem, and i\u2019m not convinced bf is not part of it as well.", "The very LEAST they could do is leave the toppings out of the salad so everyone can put in what they want.  It's not that difficult.", "My boyfriend has talked to them about it many, *many* times. He is not the problem here because he agrees with my concerns. But his family doesn't seem to care about this particular issue.", "My boyfriend told them why I did not come. It wasn't blabbing because I told him that he can be truthful (in case it helps change their ways in the future).", "People this obtuse may never get it", "Yes\n\nETA: His parents know we live together too. It's just a weird \"my roof, my rules\" situation.", "I completely agree. They are purposely and staunchly refusing to accommodate you food-wise. I'm not vegan or vegetarian, and I cook and entertain a lot. There are some very easy and delicious vegan dishes --bean salad, hummus and veggies, tapenade, grilled vegetables, etc. You can get plant based butter and nut milks and bake or have sorbet for dessert. There are vegan burgers and hotdogs. None of this is difficult or expensive.", "His family is very rude. My husband and I never really had anyone that had dietary restrictions. When my brother started dating his gf, he told me she\u2019s vegetarian. I made her some dishes at our party. It\u2019s the considerate thing to do and I\u2019d like her to come back lol.", "Then they don't care about you. Don't stress yourself worrying about people who can't be bothered to make even the smallest efforts for you.", "If he truly cared, he would stop begging you to attend and support your decisions to have an enjoyable vacation. He would tell A to stop bothering you about not attending. He would be sticking up for you.", "This is as bold as you need to be. They have to know that if they don't make you welcome, you don't feel welcome. After such an amount of time it's entirely on them to step up.", "It's wild to me that \"plant based butter\" is suddenly a thing. It's been a thing for a while, called margarine, and it was poor people food (for me and my family, we were poor lol)", "regular margarine usually has whey in it or other milk deprivatives in it actually and is not plant based at all especially the kind you probably ate growing up.", "Oh I had it as a kid, it was bright yellow and my Mom called it oleo. My hope is that the new plant based butters are lower in trans fats than oleo was.", "Trans fats have been the boogie man of the food industry for a while, so I'm sure they're a lot healthier than they used to be. And it's also easier to spread on toast than butter haha", "As someone who had some very similar experiences while dating my husband of 30 years, stick to your guns and continue to stick up for yourself. Also, know that this dynamic will likely never change.", "It would be a nice gesture if you drove up on the 4th, enjoyed the company with a bagged lunch that you brought yourself, and then drove home without spending the night.\n\nDefinitely NTA though.  I find visiting family sometimes exhausting, and the one thing it is not and will never be is \\*vacation\\*.  I wouldn't want to go fasting for a week while sleeping on an uncomfortable couch.  Inedible food and an uncomfortable bed? Sounds more like being in the hospital than being on vacation.\n\nI mean, they aren't providing you with either food OR a room.  Send this Reddit link to A and see what she says, because it is frankly \\*hilarious\\* that she thinks you're being a diva for wanting FOOD and a BED on vacation.\n\nIf I had to guess, by the way, I'm thinking that bf's family doesn't have any respect for vegans and think it's something you should just be able to leave behind while you're with them since they don't recognize it as a medical issue.  If you stay with BF, this is your future.  His family will never respect your veganism.  In some respects, this is kind of refreshing--at least you won't have your future MIL lying \"oh, there's no chicken stock in these potatoes...\" when there is, or A trying to suggest that these are vegan cookies even though they were made with milk and would put you in the bathroom for the whole trip.  They're lousy hosts, but at least they're honest about it!  It's unfortunate, but every trip you take with them, you have to treat it like camping: bring your own food and don't expect to have access to refrigeration or cooking facilities.  That's the price of seeing boyfriend's family.\n\nLots of families have the no-marriage-no-sleeping-together rule, by the way.  It's extremely common in the American South (where I am).  It allows everyone the necessary polite fiction that no sex happens outside of marriage.  Yes, we all know it does, but that isn't the point.  It's so parents of adult children who are forking like rabbits can pretend that their adult children remain pure and moral, and the adult children can pretend that their parents have no idea that they're generally forking like rabbits.  This avoids terrible conversations with otherwise sane people who suddenly find religion when there's a suggestion of sex outside the holy marital boundaries.", "I commend you for doing something I haven\u2019t had the guts to do, even though every time I end up looking like the asshole bc I\u2019m tired, covered in cigarette smoke, hungry, thirsty\u2026etc. Nope, if they can\u2019t do a little to accommodate you, I\u2019m with you, stay home. You\u2019re now my power animal! NTA", "When people show you who they are, believe them. They don't care enough about you to accommodate your eating preferences.", "NTA\nThey're not making accommodations for u at all. U're vegan for a reason. If I invite someone to my home and know they're lactose intolerant vegan, I'm preparing food that u can eat. It's their home so it's their rules about unmarried ppl not sleeping together. U don't have to go or feel guilty for not going. Keep in mind that if u and bf get married that's d only thing that will change with his family, u and him can sleep in d same bed. They won't b taking ur veganism seriously at all. So enjoy Ur alone time, he'll b back soon", "NTA they know you\u2019re vegan. I feel it rude of them to not try to make a few things vegan for you you\u2019re a guest. I wouldn\u2019t think of having a guest over without trying to accommodate them.", "Those are not petty reasons. At all. The food alone I wouldn\u2019t go. The sleeping arrangements are a hard no. Once I was past 18, I demand comfort.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t do things that make you uncomfortable", "It's not hard to provide a few vegan options. We did for a neighbor when we did a book club for a year. Between us we made sure that there were several vegan items each time so that she could enjoy the event. I'd expect better from family/his family. Especially after 4 years.", "NTA. Nowhere near vegan here, but if I host someone on vacation, they\u2019re going to be able to eat at my table without cooking for themselves. As to the religious shit, I don\u2019t mess those types of crazies anyways. Take the time for yourself and enjoy you time.", "NTA, but remember if you stay with him this will always be an issue.  If you have kids with him it will only escalate.", "NTA. I get their religious beliefs, fine. But not to even make an effort for your diet? Come on now. Save YOUR earned time off for when you can enjoy your time off with or without your BF.", "NTA.  What's the point of putting yourself through all of this?  Stressful, uncomfortable, hungry, tired...this is something to suffer through, not enjoy.  And why volunteer for that?  He wants to go see them?  Great, fine, he can knock himself out doing that.  You don't have to.", "NTA.  Honestly the vegan diet can be a pain in the arse.  That being said, to me it sounds like they are doing this on purpose, deliberately making food that you can't eat any of, making you sleep separately on the lounge where you would be continually disturbed, just in general making you feel unwelcome.  I am not vegan/vegetarian and never will be, but if using oil for cooking, it's usually olive oil, canola oil, some kind of vegetable oil, other than that I use canola cooking spray.  I steam my vegies a lot of the time, as for salads I don't see why they can't just put the cheese & bacon in little bowls beside so each person can add the quantity they want, dressings can be added by the individual too. Obviously things like potato salad are usually all premixed, but they could set aside potato for you to add your vegan cheese & dressings to etc.   I have never used chicken stock for cooking rice, but if they must use stock why can't they use vegetable stock.  I honestly think they are consciously making it so you can't eat a single item of food they prepare, and that's really apalling of them.", "You're NTA and you're sure as hell not a diva. But you have a boyfriend problem. Why doesn't your guy have your back?", "NTA.\n\nGenerally I find the concept of family vacations <shudder>, but that's just me. \n\nThink of it this way, even if you marry, the food situation will not change for you with that group. \n\nLet him go be with his family, and you do something else that is actually more like a vacation for a few days. Hold a couple of days back so that the both of you can go do an actual vacation for the both of you for a few days down the road.", "NTA. As you get more financially stable, consider a modest camper.  Get one with its own refrigerator/galley kitchen.  Cook food ahead of time/bring your own.  Think 'camping' for short visits (2/3 days).  You will be able to use this for other visits and vacations, also.  There is something for every budget.", "NTA. They are neglecting their duty to be proper hosts. As a hostess, i would have fun with the challenge of trying out new vegan recipes. They are TA.", "Yes, wasting vacation time to stay with people who don't care to be hospitable or care about your comfort or meals is definitely character building/s", "My friend had a small wedding. Her brother is dating someone with celiacs, 2 year relationship. My friend has met them twice for holidays with everyone meeting at the parent's house. My friend made sure that the entire menu at her wedding had gluten free options. She changed where she was getting her dessert order from so that the place sold gluten free comparable items.\n\nI want to be misjudging the situation, but your boyfriend's family is unspeakably rude especially now that his sister thinks she cant text you to complain about you not visiting.", "Look, I'm a carnivore, and cannot imagine ever being vegetarian, let alone vegan, and I also have absolutely no experience making vegan food, but if I invited you to my house for a cookout, I would ask you what you might like to eat, if you can give me any recipes/guidance, etc. \u2013 and I *damn sure* wouldn't go putting bacon in the salad or cooking the rice in chicken stock! And I don't even know you! \n\nThese people have been in your life for years, and they can't be bothered to remember these tiny things?? That is just wildly disrespectful, incredibly thoughtless, grossly unwelcoming, and frankly downright mean. ***And I'm really appalled by your bf's inaction.*** If my family did this to my partner, it would only happen once, because I wouldn't let it happen again. I think you need to speak to your bf, and he needs to grow a spine and stand up for you.\n\nI think you have weaker grounds for protesting about the sleeping situation. I absolutely understand why you wouldn't be thrilled about it, but since it's a rule they apply equally, it's one of those 'their house, their rules' things. But the food situation is utterly indefensible, and every last one of them should be deeply ashamed of themselves.", "not to mention if you did actually accidentally eat rice or something you thought was \u201csafe\u201d because they had said they would make it that way, it could seriously upset your stomach", "If your bf cared about you, he\u2019d stop asking you to go and would firmly inform his family that neither of you will be attending because they refuse to accommodate your dietary needs.\n\nNTA.", "But he is part of the problem.  If he insists on you doing this, even knowing what's going on, he's clearly letting you know he's okay with you having to go through this.", "This!

The plant based butter thing is weird to me. Just call it margarine and add something saying it's vegan to the ones that are vegan", "Trans-fats are no healthier than they've ever been. Since TFs come from partial hydrogenation (used to make vegetable oils more solid at room temperature) they solved the problem by fully hydrogenating vegetable oils. While this does remove trans-fats, it simply means that the veg oils are now fully saturated. So margarines now have no trans-fats, but more saturated fat. This is probably over-simplification of the process, but that's what I learned in cooking school.", "NTA. My SIL has allergies and a health condition. I host most family events and we have changed to lactose free and much healthier options to make sure EVERYONE enjoys our time together. It\u2019s not hard or expensive.

How can you invite someone as a guest and not attend to their dietary preference. Also ppl with this strict religious views are never good news imo one way or another they will eventually shove it down your throat and your future children if eventually get married.", "OP, he says they're petty reasons because the issues don't affect **him**.\n\nHe either needs to start respecting you, or this isn't going to end well.", "NTA. They are bad hosts. Letting a guest go hungry is not hospitality. Plus, doing it this often means it's probably deliberate.", "You guys have together 4yrs and they still refuse and yes they\u2019re refusing to accommodate you? That\u2019s wild NTA", "NTA. I would be the first person to call out a vegan for making unreasonable demands but you definitely are not. If they can\u2019t even leave space in the refrigerator for your food then they aren\u2019t trying in the least to accommodate you.", "NTA- my daughter recently started struggling with dairy- it would mess up her stomach so bad that she'd be in the bathroom for hours! So I would set aside servings for her that had no dairy in it! (Also cuz I love her to pieces, I looked up different dairy free recipes and tested them out on the fam, but but that's too much for them?) I also have a friend with celiac so guess what? When she comes over, I make sure she has snack options that are gluten free! I even make her gluten free peanut butter chocolate chip cookies with extra care not to cross contaminate with flour remnants. It's about taking the time to show the ones you love that you care. They don't seem willing to do that.", "NTA.  His family is not welcoming you.  Tell him he needs to have a come to Jesus moment with them if he wants you to spend time with them.  They aren't listening to your polite requests, so now he has to get vocal.", "NTA\n\nThis is very relatable to me. Vegetarian with all seafood allergies. My ex's father, whenever we would meet up (his place or when visiting us), would either choose a seafood restaurant or buy a salmon dish no matter where we went. When my ex's cousin got married, his dad threw the post wedding brunch at a seafood restaurant instead of at the hotel. When my ex's brother got married, the rehearsal dinner was at a seafood restaurant. I understand those events were about the bride and groom, so whatever they would like is what they should have, but he was asked to choose the restaurants, so he made these choices. He hated me (I wasn't what he had \"envisioned\" for his son) but wouldn't admit it, just passive-aggressively added hell to my life. \n\nFor the record, if I were my ex's father, what I would have done is either ordered in or asked this one single person (who couldn't participate with everyone else or have food ready to eat), to either go out or order in, and it would be on me. He paid for over a hundred meals each time, just not mine. I can pay for my own food but it's the principle of the matter.\n\nPlease don't keep dismissing things as \"little\" on \"not that big of a deal\" or \"I'll just remove myself/not participate, it won't affect me.\" There is a reason this story is about an ex and his family.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to make a few vegan dishes. Anytime I have vegan friends over k accommodate them in every way possible. Your in laws aren\u2019t good hosts.", "NTA.\n\nNever accommodating your food restrictions in a single dish is beyond rude.\n\nForcing a guest to sleep on a sofa because they can't handle 4 year couple who live together sharing a bed is weird.  But religion can be weird, I guess.\n\nIf you visit with his family in the future and you two remain unmarried, stay elsewhere.  You deserve to be comfortable and fed on your vacation. BF should be okay with that.", "NTA. It\u2019s incredibly rude of them to invite you and then do absolutely nothing to accommodate your dietary needs. You\u2019re not asking them to forgo their meat eating, just for a side dish or two that you could eat. Honestly I\u2019d be wary of marrying into this family because it doesn\u2019t seem like they respect you very much.", "NTA\n\nIf you feel that your values are not being acknowledged then to abstain is the path of least trouble.

I practice Islam and can't eat pork but my long time bfs family invite me on trips promise me food and then put..... BACON in everything.. and then bf goes on vacation and says don't be sensitive....", "NTA and they shouldn\u2019t be offended.

Yet nothing changes. You're continuously disrespected and left to go hungry. If your boyfriend *truly* gave a damn, he wouldn't go visit until they learned to treat you with basic human decency. He would stand his ground with you. Instead, he let's his family walk all over you. That's not the actions of a man who loves you.", "When I became lactose intolerant my (then bf) husband sent out a mass text of alternatives that I could use/eat. \n\nThey either saved me a portion without dairy ingredients or simply used imperial. Hell, his grandma made me an entire casserole without dairy products and other people enjoyed it as well. They did that because they cared and it was a simple request. \n\nGranted, my husband gets frustrated he has to remind people every year because they always call to ask what they can use but still, they actually care. \n\nYour bf family doesn't seem to care and you deserve better.", "Your boyfriend should be backing you until this is resolved; he should be insisting that his family accommodate you, either in their cooking or at minimum by making space in the fridge.", "Between my 3 kids and their spouses we now have: one vegan, one gluten free, one dairy free, one egg allergy, and 2 corn allergies.

But they're stubborn. And we only see them a few times a year so we mutually decided to just suck it up.", "He wasn't technically begging me to go. He enjoys being around his family more when I'm there too, so he was a little saddened by my decision to not go.", "Do you ever host them?

It\u2019s incredibly rude what she said.", "He doesn't. He has repeatedly asked and reminded his family about vegan options, but since his parents do most of the cooking, they \"forget\".
