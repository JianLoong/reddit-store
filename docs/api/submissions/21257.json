I have met and visited his family numerous times. They're lovely. His family asked us to visit them for a week to celebrate the 4th of July.\n\n\r  \nI declined. Here are my reasons:\n\n\r  \nI have been vegan since birth (vegetarian family + lactose intolerance). I have no desire to eat meat. My bf and his family are voracious carnivores. I have no issue with this. My diet preferences are mine alone. That said, every time we visit his family, I am left to fend for myself regarding food.\r  \n\r  \nHis parents make three-course meals and barbecues for everyone, and not even a single item is made vegan. The salads have bacon in them. Roast potatoes are cooked in lard. Rice is cooked with chicken stock. I always have to buy ingredients and then cook my meals. Because their fridge is packed to capacity with their food, I have no space to cook a large batch of food and store it, so I have to cook every day. This is exhausting, especially on a vacation. I have politely asked them if they could leave out bacon/chicken stock in salads and rice, and they agree, only to \"forget\" when the time comes.\r  \n\r  \nAnother thing is that his family is religious and doesn't want unmarried couples to sleep in the same bedroom. This means that I share a room with his sister A, and his A's partner shares the room with my bf.\n\nA married her partner of 2 years a few months ago, and they are now allowed to sleep in the same bedroom. But since we are unmarried, I was unsure what the sleeping arrangement would be like since they only have three bedrooms. I asked his parents about this, and they said I would need to sleep on the sofa in the living room.\r  \n\r  \nThis was when I checked out. This \"vacation\" is not even slightly appealing to me. I love his family, but not enough to give up every ounce of comfort. Staying in hotels is not possible since they live in a remote area without any hotels within 20 mi. I told my bf that I wouldn't be coming on this or any future vacations until they either fix the food or the sleeping situation (or both).\r  \n\r  \nMy bf insisted that I come and offered to sleep on the sofa. But I know that he has back problems and the mattress in his room is an orthopedic one, and sleeping on the sofa will fuck him up for a long time. I told him that I'd much rather save my time off for an actual vacation where I get to relax and enjoy myself without worrying about going hungry or not getting enough sleep. I encouraged him to go and spend time with his family without me, and he reluctantly went.\r  \n\r  \nSince yesterday, A has been texting me and implying that I was being a diva for not coming because of \"petty\" reasons. I was polite, but I held my ground. But a part of me is wondering if I am being an asshole since there was no other reason for me not to go except the ones I stated.\r  \n\r  \nIf I am being an asshole, I plan on driving over tonight to be there on the 4th.", "created_utc": 1688418362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14puuom/aita_for_refusing_to_vacation_with_my_bfs_family/", "score": 291, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you respectfully informed your bf of your reasons and encouraged him to attend. Your reasons are entirely valid. I wouldn't want to waste my vacation days in that situation either.", "NTA. My partner has the same issue with my family. She is vegan and my family doesn't know how to eat vegetables. After 8 years they've started trying, but roasted zucchini and peppers isn't exactly a full meal. We've started bringing dishes for her when we have get-togethers. I'm positive you would feel limited in options having to cook daily when they're probably already eating.\n\nI don't blame you a single bit for drawing the line at sleeping on the couch when you could easily sleep with your bf, which I'm assuming they must know happens at home? \"My house, my rules, blah blah blah.\" It's asinine in this day and age to dictate sleeping arrangements. It was good of you to hold firm, and if anyone is being a diva it's A due to her petty texts. Don't drive there for the 4th.

Personally it doesn't feel like his family is accomodating to you at all. I wouldn't go either. If they know you have dietary restrictions, why can't they make even a single dish, or at least have fresh veggies, fruits, and other vegan friendly options available for you to eat? Not every dish needs to have meat or dairy products in it. Nothing wrong with plain rice made with just water and a few seasonings in a rice cooker...shit that's really easy to make and will accommodate your needs. You could bring your own food, but again that's not fair to you when food is provided to everyone else. What does your boyfriend think of all this?", "NTA. I don\u2019t blame you at all for not wanting to go.", "NTA. As a general rule, you shouldn't go places where you're made to feel unwelcome. You might like his family, but they pretty clearly don't actually like you. They are purposely failing to accommodate your diet. It is not difficult to leave bacon out of salads and cook rice with water or vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. When I have invited guests with dietary restrictions staying with me, I go out of my way to make sure they have suitable things to eat and don't feel excluded. And I'd never ask someone to sleep on a sofa. They can't even get you an air mattress or a roll-away bed? Or relax their ridiculous rule for a couple who's been together for four years?", "NTA-My sister in law is vegan and we always MAKE SURE to have food for her at every family event. If we don\u2019t have ingredients we even pay to order her vegan food so she isn\u2019t left out. We do this because we love her.\n\nHis family does not love you.", "NTA. (Vegan here as well; I completely get where you're coming from.) \n\nI don't think you're asking for much either. You're not asking for his family to not eat meat around you or change their meal plan entirely. They could truly be more accommodating and respectful towards you by either setting up some of the same salad to the side (without the meat) or putting the meat on the side. Simple things like this can go a long way. Or if they asked you if you wanted some Vegan 'hot dogs\" to include you in the BBQ. \nIt kinda comes across like they don't respect your dietary needs.\n\nYou don't come across like a diva. You just wish your boyfriends family could be more accommodating is all. \n\nIt's also okay to respect their religious beliefs in you guys not sharing a room so long as they respect your beliefs in being vegan. Relationships of any kind are give and take. \n\nSo I think if they were willing to accommodate you on the food, you'd probably be okay to not share a room with your partner. Yeah? But they weren't even willing to meet you halfway in this exchange and that sucks. \nIt's hard to have a vacation without food you can eat.\nI hope when your boyfriend returns home, you guys can have a healthy conversation about it. I'm sure there's a lot he doesn't understand about it either even though he's been dating a vegan for years.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I hate to say it, but you're making yourself a doormat for them & fooling yourself into believing you 'love' them.", "His family is making obvious statements about your lifestyle choices. I doubt it will change ever, so it\u2019s gonna be accept them bc they don\u2019t accept you unless you give in. They are pushing to stand their ground. Can you stand your ground against all of them? What happens when the little ones come? Will they try to make you look petty or foolish in front of your kids? And what if one child sides with you and another sides with them?\nObviously the bf has chosen sides. \nI think you are a solid person who has made solid life choices. I think you should keep looking. It\u2019s a lot less trouble in the long run.", "NTA, when I have guests, I feed them and put them in the most comfortable places to sleep that I can. \n\nIf I'm cooking for a large group, I *ALWAYS* make sure to include at least one thing that complies with their dietary habits. If they're vegetarian, guess what. They're getting one hell of a vegetarian dish. \n\nIf they're vegan, I do the best I can to make something that's at least edible, even if it may not be the most impressive food. I'm not very good at vegan cooking, I've tried. I made something once, and it was awful.", "Not sure that having food to eat and a bed to sleep on count as petty reasons. Seem pretty basic to me. NTA.", "NTA- my husband is vegetarian (I know it\u2019s not the same) and my family are very big meat eaters too but we still take the time to make sure HE has food he can eat that isn\u2019t contaminated by meat or byproducts. It\u2019s not hard to accommodate to make sure you have food to enjoy. \n\nIt was kind of him to offer the bed for you, and also considerate of you not to take it because of his back. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect someone to sleep on a couch for a vacation.", "Your points are valid. If I ever had a guest with dietary restrictions, I would do my best to accommodate them when I cooked. I definitely need to rethink my views.", "in the absolute most charitable read, these people are awful hosts. but i can\u2019t help but think even an awful host would remember op is vegan after 4 years. nta, this is icky behaviour from bf\u2019s family. a is part of the problem, and i\u2019m not convinced bf is not part of it as well.", "The very LEAST they could do is leave the toppings out of the salad so everyone can put in what they want.  It's not that difficult.", "My boyfriend has talked to them about it many, *many* times. He is not the problem here because he agrees with my concerns. But his family doesn't seem to care about this particular issue.", "My boyfriend told them why I did not come. It wasn't blabbing because I told him that he can be truthful (in case it helps change their ways in the future).", "People this obtuse may never get it", "Yes\n\nETA: His parents know we live together too. It's just a weird \"my roof, my rules\" situation.", "I completely agree. They are purposely and staunchly refusing to accommodate you food-wise. I'm not vegan or vegetarian, and I cook and entertain a lot. There are some very easy and delicious vegan dishes --bean salad, hummus and veggies, tapenade, grilled vegetables, etc. You can get plant based butter and nut milks and bake or have sorbet for dessert. There are vegan burgers and hotdogs. None of this is difficult or expensive.", "His family is very rude. My husband and I never really had anyone that had dietary restrictions. When my brother started dating his gf, he told me she\u2019s vegetarian. I made her some dishes at our party. It\u2019s the considerate thing to do and I\u2019d like her to come back lol.", "Then they don't care about you. Don't stress yourself worrying about people who can't be bothered to make even the smallest efforts for you.", "If he truly cared, he would stop begging you to attend and support your decisions to have an enjoyable vacation. He would tell A to stop bothering you about not attending. He would be sticking up for you.", "This is as bold as you need to be. They have to know that if they don't make you welcome, you don't feel welcome. After such an amount of time it's entirely on them to step up.", "It's wild to me that \"plant based butter\" is suddenly a thing. It's been a thing for a while, called margarine, and it was poor people food (for me and my family, we were poor lol)", "regular margarine usually has whey in it or other milk deprivatives in it actually and is not plant based at all especially the kind you probably ate growing up.", "Oh I had it as a kid, it was bright yellow and my Mom called it oleo. My hope is that the new plant based butters are lower in trans fats than oleo was.", "Trans fats have been the boogie man of the food industry for a while, so I'm sure they're a lot healthier than they used to be. And it's also easier to spread on toast than butter haha", "As someone who had some very similar experiences while dating my husband of 30 years, stick to your guns and continue to stick up for yourself. Also, know that this dynamic will likely never change.", "It would be a nice gesture if you drove up on the 4th, enjoyed the company with a bagged lunch that you brought yourself, and then drove home without spending the night.\n\nDefinitely NTA though.  I find visiting family sometimes exhausting, and the one thing it is not and will never be is \\*vacation\\*.  I wouldn't want to go fasting for a week while sleeping on an uncomfortable couch.  Inedible food and an uncomfortable bed? Sounds more like being in the hospital than being on vacation.\n\nI mean, they aren't providing you with either food OR a room.  Send this Reddit link to A and see what she says, because it is frankly \\*hilarious\\* that she thinks you're being a diva for wanting FOOD and a BED on vacation.\n\nIf I had to guess, by the way, I'm thinking that bf's family doesn't have any respect for vegans and think it's something you should just be able to leave behind while you're with them since they don't recognize it as a medical issue.  If you stay with BF, this is your future.  His family will never respect your veganism.  In some respects, this is kind of refreshing--at least you won't have your future MIL lying \"oh, there's no chicken stock in these potatoes...\" when there is, or A trying to suggest that these are vegan cookies even though they were made with milk and would put you in the bathroom for the whole trip.  They're lousy hosts, but at least they're honest about it!  It's unfortunate, but every trip you take with them, you have to treat it like camping: bring your own food and don't expect to have access to refrigeration or cooking facilities.  That's the price of seeing boyfriend's family.\n\nLots of families have the no-marriage-no-sleeping-together rule, by the way.  It's extremely common in the American South (where I am).  It allows everyone the necessary polite fiction that no sex happens outside of marriage.  Yes, we all know it does, but that isn't the point.  It's so parents of adult children who are forking like rabbits can pretend that their adult children remain pure and moral, and the adult children can pretend that their parents have no idea that they're generally forking like rabbits.  This avoids terrible conversations with otherwise sane people who suddenly find religion when there's a suggestion of sex outside the holy marital boundaries.", "I commend you for doing something I haven\u2019t had the guts to do, even though every time I end up looking like the asshole bc I\u2019m tired, covered in cigarette smoke, hungry, thirsty\u2026etc. Nope, if they can\u2019t do a little to accommodate you, I\u2019m with you, stay home. You\u2019re now my power animal! NTA", "When people show you who they are, believe them. They don't care enough about you to accommodate your eating preferences.", "NTA\nThey're not making accommodations for u at all. U're vegan for a reason. If I invite someone to my home and know they're lactose intolerant vegan, I'm preparing food that u can eat. It's their home so it's their rules about unmarried ppl not sleeping together. U don't have to go or feel guilty for not going. Keep in mind that if u and bf get married that's d only thing that will change with his family, u and him can sleep in d same bed. They won't b taking ur veganism seriously at all. So enjoy Ur alone time, he'll b back soon", "NTA they know you\u2019re vegan. I feel it rude of them to not try to make a few things vegan for you you\u2019re a guest. I wouldn\u2019t think of having a guest over without trying to accommodate them.", "Those are not petty reasons. At all. The food alone I wouldn\u2019t go. The sleeping arrangements are a hard no. Once I was past 18, I demand comfort.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t do things that make you uncomfortable", "It's not hard to provide a few vegan options. We did for a neighbor when we did a book club for a year. Between us we made sure that there were several vegan items each time so that she could enjoy the event. I'd expect better from family/his family. Especially after 4 years.", "NTA. Nowhere near vegan here, but if I host someone on vacation, they\u2019re going to be able to eat at my table without cooking for themselves. As to the religious shit, I don\u2019t mess those types of crazies anyways. Take the time for yourself and enjoy you time.", "NTA, but remember if you stay with him this will always be an issue.  If you have kids with him it will only escalate.", "NTA. I get their religious beliefs, fine. But not to even make an effort for your diet? Come on now. Save YOUR earned time off for when you can enjoy your time off with or without your BF.", "NTA.  What's the point of putting yourself through all of this?  Stressful, uncomfortable, hungry, tired...this is something to suffer through, not enjoy.  And why volunteer for that?  He wants to go see them?  Great, fine, he can knock himself out doing that.  You don't have to.", "NTA.  Honestly the vegan diet can be a pain in the arse.  That being said, to me it sounds like they are doing this on purpose, deliberately making food that you can't eat any of, making you sleep separately on the lounge where you would be continually disturbed, just in general making you feel unwelcome.  I am not vegan/vegetarian and never will be, but if using oil for cooking, it's usually olive oil, canola oil, some kind of vegetable oil, other than that I use canola cooking spray.  I steam my vegies a lot of the time, as for salads I don't see why they can't just put the cheese & bacon in little bowls beside so each person can add the quantity they want, dressings can be added by the individual too. Obviously things like potato salad are usually all premixed, but they could set aside potato for you to add your vegan cheese & dressings to etc.   I have never used chicken stock for cooking rice, but if they must use stock why can't they use vegetable stock.

My friend not only took leftovers home, but also the food she brought in case there wasn't anything she could eat. \nIf your boyfriend cared enough, this kind of situation would be you. If his family wanted you to come, they would welcome you. They have not, so why show up?", "NTA. my vegan friend started dating this guy and the first time she went to their house they made vegan main and side dishes AND a vegan dessert just for her to take home (they live 300 miles away OOS.) also they're all developly Catholic including my friend but they let her choose where to sleep because it's their relationship. (although they did end up sleeping separately because they're waiting for marriage and they were only like two months in at that point)", "They are petty vindictive people as well as terrible hosts to make sure you can't eat the food. I'm not sure why you like these people, but NTA.", "My ex was living in a rural area on a farm. I am vegetarian since birth. His mom was not a nice lady at all, very oldschool, stubborn, overall rude towards everyone... But she always made a vegetable soup when I came to visit instead of beef, and made sure I had some baked potatoes and veggies to eat as well. And mind me, we were only a couple for two years and she didn't even like me much lol\nThey are assholes, you are not. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour BF is siding with his family unreasonably. He doesn't care about your eating and cooking style or anything else you mention--and do you think for one minute that his family would  to let him sleep on the couch even after he has agreed to it?\n\nHold your ground--and I think you need a new BF. A vacation should be fun and this one isn't going to be. He isn't listening to a word you say.\n\nDon't go.", "NTA\n\nHis family doesn't sound nice at all. If they were \"lovely\", they would be making stuff you can eat. \n\nYeah, I'm sure you love them but they don't love you. \n\nI also wouldn't sleep on a sofa with no privacy and it's not a vacation. This is also a whole fucking week, not like 1 night.", "ugh. sounds like the parents love the power trip. NTA for keeping your own authority over where you sleep and what you eat. \n\nOnly agree to see who you want to on your terms.", "> Lots of families have the no-marriage-no-sleeping-together rule, by the way. It's extremely common in the American South (where I am). It allows everyone the necessary polite fiction that no sex happens outside of marriage. Yes, we all know it does, but that isn't the point. It's so parents of adult children who are forking like rabbits can pretend that their adult children remain pure and moral, and the adult children can pretend that their parents have no idea that they're generally forking like rabbits. This avoids terrible conversations with otherwise sane people who suddenly find religion when there's a suggestion of sex outside the holy marital boundaries.\n\nOP and her bf live together and the parents know it. If they can pretend no sex happens in OPs apartment they can extend the same logic to their own house instead of forcing one of the two to endure back pain & bad sleep for several days. (And honestly, I\u2019m inclined to believe the parents house is the last place OP and bf want to have sex anyway so it\u2019s dumb to draw the line there).", "Dude if you're inviting someone over, it's basic courtesy to have at least one food item that they can eat. They can easily make salad or potatoes the vegan way. If you're not worth doing this bare minimum for- are they worth YOUR time?\n\nNTA but I think it's time to have a serious heart to heart with your bf.", "Why is your bf telling his sister things and letting her speak to you that way", "This isn't even about making any special efforts for you. They're putting bacon in the salad, FFS. They're not \"lovely\" people, they're controlling AHs who are deadset on either bending you to their ways, or removing you from their son's life to make space for a more covenient woman.", "My partner of 2.5 years is vegetarian, my family is not, but my mom always always always makes sure we have food that works for my partner because she loves him and wants to make sure he feels accepted and welcome at family gatherings. You deserve that from the family of someone you might spend the rest of your life loving.", "So they don't respect your vegan life style.   (\"A\"'s remark shows me they never \"forgot\", they just couldn't be bothered with respecting it, and therefore respecting you).\n\nAnd they don't respect your life choice of living together with their son.\n\nSo if you don't ever intend to getting married, you'll be banned to the couch even when you'll be 50 years old?\n\nChoose your comfort. Choose you. Stay home.\n\nAnd next year go somewhere nice with your BF for the 4th of July.\n\nNTA", "THIS!\n\nOP, are you reading this?", "Umm mutually? Sounds like you\u2019re the only one suffering, sis.", "Sounds like the 'mutually' part has come to an end.", "They don\u2019t change because they aren\u2019t made too, they still get to see their son and eat meat in EVERYTHING. I imagine if he stopped showing up, MIL would remember you are Vegan.", "You mutually decide to let go of a problem that affects only you? \n\nYour bf telling his family to treat you better and then letting them walk all over you is NOT standing up for you. \n\nIt\u2019s handwringing.\n\nYou are bending over backwards to defend him and he he\u2019s barely even stretching out a finger to help you.\n\nHe\u2019s fine with letting it go because it doesn\u2019t affect him. He is not being a good partner to you.\n\nYou do not have a family issue. You have a bf issue.", "Till the BF and his parents go shopping for meat.... and cook up a big meal for themselves and leave the OP out altogether.", "Her home, her rules ;).", "I don't know. It seems you know something I don't about the BFs family. Maybe you are a mind reader :)", "My husband has recently developed what we think is a dairy allergy and we LOVE anything Miyokos!"]}
