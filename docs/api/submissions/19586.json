It's not your fault she forgot them.", "NTA but it sounds like something else is going on", "NTA! Though your wife sounds like real piece of work.

What will happen if she doesn\u2019t take them for 48 hrs?", "NTA - it sounds like she may need professional help, but please if you consider asking her to see someone don't actually say she needs mental help. That will definitely not win you any points. She has some sort of anxiety it seems.", "NTA, they're probiotics, by definitionm brand cannot matter, going to the nearby chemist should have been acceptable", "She can't drive herself?\n\nMaybe y'all should consider separate vacations in the future; a little time alone. \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA, she is being unreasonable and punishing you for her mistake.  A rational person would have just gone and try to find a suitable substitute.  She owes you an apology for flying off the handle.", "NTA but you knew that. If this is the whole truth, anyway. Confused as to why she couldn't drive herself?", "NTA\n\nBut regardless, your vacation is pretty much done.  You go get the probiotics, you will be pissed, you dont go get them, she will be pissed.\n\nDid you at least check the vitamin shop, or other stores, online and see if they had the right brand?   I take it HER driving back alone is out of the question?  How about someone getting them and meeting you halfway?", "It would have been less drama to just go get the probiotics.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
