We are either close enough that you want me there to support and celebrate your actual marriage with you or we are not. In my country, everyone just combines the legal/religious ceremonies and then heads off to the reception. The celebrant just has to be registered to be able to marry you and you must say a very specific phrase for the marriage to be legal.

I don't know why they're keeping it a secret, but it removes none of the importance to the ceremony itself. The goal of having a party is to celebrate with your friends and family. That's still true.\n\nYou're overthinking this too much. What does it matter if they have signed a paper before or not?\n\nI've been to one of these. A cousin was living abroad and they got married there for tax purposes and then wanted to have a \"proper wedding\" in her home country with her family (and have a church wedding as well).

The lying is really the issue.", "NTA - While perfectly acceptable to stage a full wedding after they\u2019re already eloped, it absolutely should be disclosed to guests. The fact they\u2019re keeping it secret from 100s of guests illustrates they understand perfectly well that the guests believe the wedding they are spending their time, money, & effort to attend next year is *the* wedding. I suspect they are hiding it to keep all of their guests coming, as some would absolutely not expend that same effort for what is essentially a very late reception/vow renewal. Fact is, they are being deceptive & disrespecting their guests by hiding this. It\u2019s unlikely the discrepancy will remain hidden forever, and some guests will feel deceived & manipulated when it does come out. I understand wanting the big party, but they chose to elope. That\u2019s great. Them choosing to lie about it is just wrong though. These are supposed to be beloved family & friends yet they\u2019re lying to all of them. Do they plan on lying every time these dates are ever brought up forever? Having 2 anniversaries every year keeping one a secret?", "NTA. All those people saying that a party a year after the marriage is still a wedding are missing the point: if that were true why are they hiding it from their guests? Why is it OK to lie to people spending a lot of money to be there?", "To me the vows are the ceremony, the party is the wedding. I\u2019ve been to 2 weddings where the couple married in pricey destination weddings then had a celebration back home for the folks who couldn\u2019t fly out and stay in a pricey hotel beca they wanted those people to celebrate with them too. You are entitled to your opinion, but why do you want to ruin this for your boyfriend? He seems to be really looking forward to it.", "YTA - for this couple it\u2019s still important to celebrate with friends and loved ones.

The reason they want to keep secret is because they know the gift giving will be largely reduced for various reasons, and that's what make it shady.", "NTA.

She spent a lot of money and dressed up as a flower fairy to dance down the aisle...Just to hear that the wedding ceremony wasn't real. She was very hurt that the rest of the bridal party knew, because they were witnesses at the elopement while she was left in the dark. \n\nIF a couple elopes and surpises everyone with the fact at the party, nobody should know, otherwise they should just tell everyone, other options will only lead to hurt.

Some might not want to travel or pay as much money for a wedding that isn't an actual wedding.\n\n??\n\nBut it is actually going to be a wedding celebration/party, a celebration of the couple being married.\n\nMany people do this. I mean, I've had a couple of my friends went to the courthouse and got legally married there. Then they had the wedding party abroad. My cousin even did this, he married his sweetheart when they're around 25 yrs old, but at that time, they're both still struggling financially so it took them 5 years to save up and had a destination wedding (with family and friends flying to the location).

There's no reason to go to a wedding if you don't care about the couple, and you certainly shouldn't be worrying about a gift.", "In case you didn't know this, most wedding ceremonies aren't actually witnessing the legal part. That is typically, but not always, done in advance.", "They weren't important enough to invite to your wedding, which probably hurt them, why would you expect your party to be a priority? The brother and his fiance hete are lying to all their guests.", "To make it clear, as you're making a bit of an ass of yourself with your clueless assumptions. I went to the wedding that I referenced in my post, and I made no such comments. I *heard other guests* making the comments. Multiple other guests.  Please let me know if there is any other confusion I can clear up for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy whole point is that the deception is not necessary.  As you said, people go to celebrate the couple.\n\nAs another example, I went to a destination wedding for a friend of mine that very few went to. A few weeks later they had a big celebration after in a park by their home, and the invites literally said \"Please come celebrate with us after we return from our honeymoon!\" Making it clear hat they already got married, yet plenty of people (me included) came out to celebrate. No deception involved.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: There can be other ways to do things without involving deception.", "And this idiocy is why they lied \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I literally had a signing at a registry office with two witnesses. I did want to celebrate with my loved ones which is why I invited them. If they literally don't care enough to celebrate that occasion with you, they don't deserve an invite anyway tbh.", "My thoughts exactly. So what happens if someone celebrates their birthday after it's passed. It's just a party? Lol", "NTA. I'd be upset if I was invited to a wedding, too vacation time, spent money on travel and a gift, then learned it was more of a gift grab. People need to be honest and invite people to their reception if they're already married; they know people don't prioritize receptions like they do weddings and don't care if they alienate people when the truth comes out. They just want the gifts.", "Married and Wedding are two completely separate things.\n\nYou can have a wedding without getting married.\nYou can get married without a wedding. \n\n\nWho gives a shit when they signed the paper? Before? After? Never? A wedding is a celebration, nothing more.\nGetting married is a piece of paper, nothing more.", "I really don't agree. There's a vast difference between lying and keeping something in your private life private. In some places you're officially married with the paperwork. You've probably been to weddings where they are already officially married. People are attending the celebration honoring their commitment, AKA wedding. I can't imagine anyone actually going up after the reception and asking if this is the true legal date.\n\nMy parents got married in the 1970s and chose to elope because my mom refused to have premarital sex. A year later they had a ridiculously huge Polish Catholic wedding. I'm one of five people still alive that know they eloped beforehand. I never considered what they did to be dishonest and would never call it lying. That was simply something that most people didn't need to know.\n\nOmitting deeply personal things that only impact two people is really not lying. There are things that other people just don't need to know.", "Hard agree. I feel like this would solve most AITA questions lol -- \"let people enjoy things!\"", "So...so many people are actually technically married by the town clerk when they get their marriage certificate.  Everything else is just celebration.", "Nope. Not even close. No one in the US is married until the vows, either by clergy, courthouse, or other. In fact, you are NOT legally married until the license is signed after the ceremony. And then there's some legal stuff you can't even do until the certificate comes back. This false info could screw somebody.\n\nAlso, that stuf you do in the courthouse before the ceremony is TEMPORARY. You license expires if you don't use it in a certain amount of time. In Georgia, USA, that's 30 days. If something happens and you miss the window, you have to go back to the courthouse and repeat the process for another license.", "The reception is a party. It isn't the wedding.", "Jewish weddings have many document signings as part of the entire event, often before the ceremony, sometimes during!\n\nI don\u2019t know if OP is Jewish, but this is a standard part!", "That was my biggest fear at my wedding: that we would do something wrong, and not have a legal marriage lol. That's a silly focus on a day that's supposed to be about love and family.", "I discovered some weird shit about marriage licenses when my bestie got married a while back.\n\nThey were having a cheap wedding at their house, and had to delay it after getting the marriage license, so it was close to expiring by their wedding day. A local rabbi that they liked to chat with at their neighbourhood cafe volunteered to marry them for free (ironically they had to spend more making the wedding fit his parameters, like kosher food, but I digress). After they tied the knot and went upstairs, they he said he couldn't sign the license because his particular sect didn't believe in government, so he wasn't ordained \ud83d\ude02) They panicked a little, then came down and we had the reception, and no one was ever the wiser.\n\nThe next morning g she woke me up at 7 am, and we went out to a cafe where she told me what was going on... They were leaving for their honeymoon in 2 days, and their license was going to expire before they got back! We called around to help lines that would answer (it was a Sunday and neither of us had cellphones with browsers yet) eventually found out that if she let it lapse, they would have to go to court to get it annulled or something before they could get another one. They weren't married, but the proceeding to deal with the lapsed license was very similar to a divorce, and would have cost more than their cheap wedding \ud83d\ude43 \n\nThey had spent everything and maxed out their cards between the wedding and honeymoon (honeymoon was also cheap, but included a flight across the country to visit her husband's family) but had a whole bunch of cash and cheques they were given... But to book a city hall wedding for the next day, they had to put it on a credit card or debit, and the bank wouldn't have credited them with the money for a few days if they deposited it, so I put the wedding on my credit card, and she paid me back in cash (then i had to get on a bus back to my city for work the next day, so missed the \"real\" wedding)", "There are countries in which you have to have a civil ceremony for it to count in the eyes of the government, so if you for one reason or another end up having to do the legal one separately from the main event, you're most likely already technically married when the \"real\" ceremony starts. \n\nI'm sure a few feel cheated, but since it's the same for everybody most just see it as a fact of life and not really much different from the other hoops you have to jump through in order to become spouses. \n\nIn any case, the US is not one of those countries, but e.g. France is.", "But lying means they're likely to lose relationships with friends and family but they dgaf", "There is a significant difference between inviting people to celebrate the actual event with you and inviting people to an extravagant party for an event that took place a year ago and plenty of people would prioritise it differently. Are you likely to blow 1k to celebrate a friends first wedding anniversary?", "If they're married it's not a wedding and they're deceiving everyone. Call it a vow renewal or reception but it isn't a wedding", "But in this case, the deception is the problem", "It\u2019s not deception. You\u2019re invited to a wedding celebration. I\u2019ve never seen a wedding invitation that says \u201cjoin us for a legal signing of documents.\u201d", "They're inviting people to a wedding. They're already married", "I've gotten invitations that say \"we invite you to witness the marriage of...\" Or something like that. If the marriage already happened, what are we witnessing? Everyone knows that you have a wedding to get married. If you've done it months and months in advance and don't tell anyone, it's deception.", "But you didn't invite them to your wedding, then expect them to give you gifts."]}
