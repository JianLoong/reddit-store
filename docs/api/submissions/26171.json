It is the vows and commitment you make which really matters, whether it be in a cathedral or a backyard ceremony. We are either close enough that you want me there to support and celebrate your actual marriage with you or we are not. In my country, everyone just combines the legal/religious ceremonies and then heads off to the reception. The celebrant just has to be registered to be able to marry you and you must say a very specific phrase for the marriage to be legal.

We went to the courthouse and got legally married, just the 2 of us. I actually worked for 6 hours that day and then we went in the afternoon. One year later we had a \"wedding\" but 90% of the guests had no idea we were already married. We did it that way because we didn't live near family and my husband was in the military. There was a chance he would be deployed, and if we weren't married, I wouldn't be able to stay in our apartment while he was gone. \n\nThere are a lot of reasons couples might elope and then have a larger ceremony later.", "YTA\n\nThe wedding festivities are exactly the same. I don't know why they're keeping it a secret, but it removes none of the importance to the ceremony itself. The goal of having a party is to celebrate with your friends and family. That's still true.\n\nYou're overthinking this too much. What does it matter if they have signed a paper before or not?\n\nI've been to one of these. A cousin was living abroad and they got married there for tax purposes and then wanted to have a \"proper wedding\" in her home country with her family (and have a church wedding as well). Everyone was ok with it as everybody wanted to celebrate with them. It didn't remove anything from the thing itself.\n\nI bet they'll still have a cerimony.", "NTA.

It could destroy some relationships if the don\u2019t disclose beforehand and people find out after spending the money and time to attend under false pretenses.", "NTA.

If they wanted to elope and be married a year earlier, that's all good but they can't then lie to their guests and expect people to still throw them all the other parties (shower, Bach/bachelorette) under false pretenses.\n\nIf this was acceptable where they are, they wouldn't be lying about it.", "None of the people calling you the asshole have said anything about the hiding it part, which is really what it sounds like you had a problem with. The lying is really the issue.", "NTA - While perfectly acceptable to stage a full wedding after they\u2019re already eloped, it absolutely should be disclosed to guests. The fact they\u2019re keeping it secret from 100s of guests illustrates they understand perfectly well that the guests believe the wedding they are spending their time, money, & effort to attend next year is *the* wedding. I suspect they are hiding it to keep all of their guests coming, as some would absolutely not expend that same effort for what is essentially a very late reception/vow renewal. Fact is, they are being deceptive & disrespecting their guests by hiding this. It\u2019s unlikely the discrepancy will remain hidden forever, and some guests will feel deceived & manipulated when it does come out. I understand wanting the big party, but they chose to elope. That\u2019s great. Them choosing to lie about it is just wrong though. These are supposed to be beloved family & friends yet they\u2019re lying to all of them. Do they plan on lying every time these dates are ever brought up forever? Having 2 anniversaries every year keeping one a secret?", "NTA. All those people saying that a party a year after the marriage is still a wedding are missing the point: if that were true why are they hiding it from their guests? Why is it OK to lie to people spending a lot of money to be there?", "To me the vows are the ceremony, the party is the wedding. I\u2019ve been to 2 weddings where the couple married in pricey destination weddings then had a celebration back home for the folks who couldn\u2019t fly out and stay in a pricey hotel beca they wanted those people to celebrate with them too. You are entitled to your opinion, but why do you want to ruin this for your boyfriend? He seems to be really looking forward to it.", "YTA - for this couple it\u2019s still important to celebrate with friends and loved ones.

Bet a lot of people see it differently than what reddit thinks.", "NTA... if people think it's not an issue, why are they also ok with the secrecy? The reason they want to keep secret is because they know the gift giving will be largely reduced for various reasons, and that's what make it shady.", "NTA.

But it\u2019s not a wedding. \n\nAlso, do they plan on lying about their anniversary for the rest of their lives?", "NTA\n\nA gew weeks ago, there was a bridesmaid/ sister of the groom who was surprised by the wedding not the actual wedding, because the couple eloped. She spent a lot of money and dressed up as a flower fairy to dance down the aisle...Just to hear that the wedding ceremony wasn't real. She was very hurt that the rest of the bridal party knew, because they were witnesses at the elopement while she was left in the dark. \n\nIF a couple elopes and surpises everyone with the fact at the party, nobody should know, otherwise they should just tell everyone, other options will only lead to hurt. Even this will probably lead to drama and already has.", ">He asked me what I meant, so I said that I feel like it was shitty to hide that information from people. Some might not want to travel or pay as much money for a wedding that isn't an actual wedding.\n\n??\n\nBut it is actually going to be a wedding celebration/party, a celebration of the couple being married.\n\nMany people do this. I mean, I've had a couple of my friends went to the courthouse and got legally married there. Then they had the wedding party abroad. My cousin even did this, he married his sweetheart when they're around 25 yrs old, but at that time, they're both still struggling financially so it took them 5 years to save up and had a destination wedding (with family and friends flying to the location).

You should be able to tell him how you feel and what you think even if you disagree. \n\nIn my country, all weddings must be at the courthouse to be legal, so no courthouse = no wedding.

She can feel that way if she wants, and express it to her partner if she thinks it's relevant, whether you agree with her or not.\n\nI've been to wedding celebrations where the couple had gotten married earlier for whatever reasons. And they were great! I love to celebrate my friends and family. But the crucial part is, they didn't keep anything hidden, they were upfront about it.", "But that's the issue. Later on there is still a ceremony, the religious part. The guests still take part in the festivities. \n\nThe way I understood this story, all that is left of this wedding is the party. No religious ceremony, nothing that will make the guests feel like part of the event.", "I love all the correlaries that spring from this logic. \n\nBirthday parties can only happen on the actual birthday; otherwise you're falsifying your identity and grifting for presents.\n\nEngagement announcements cannot be a thing unless at least half of the couple is as surprised as everyone else. \n\nPregnancy announcements better involve a livestream of the first time peeing on the stick. \n\nYou can be in mourning and count on communal support for exactly 24 hours after a loved one's passing.  If you don't notify everyone who knows of your existence of the sad news within the 24 hour window, you're also deceitful.", "My husband is from China and we had two weddings, one in Australia and one in China. Only one involved the legal paperwork (the Australian one because it involved fewer notarised translated forms) but they were both weddings! Both of them were a gathering of family and friends to make a public declaration of commitment in front of our community!", "People who talk about gift grabs must either have a *wildly* different friend group to mine or have never planned a wedding, because I can assure you 99.99% of weddings are spending more per guest than they get back in gifts.\n\nWe had a CHEAP wedding (>$10k) and it was still $65 per person just for food (no alcohol included) before any other costs, and we definitely weren\u2019t averaging $130 per couple in gifts received. Which is fine because we invited them not for gifts but because we wanted them to share the day with us!!", "Why wouldn't it be as important or an even more important day to the couple though?", "I will tell people next time I\u00b4m not invited to the day of their birthday but to a birthday party the weekend after, that I will not commit to such a gift grab.", "By that logic you shouldn't go to anniversary or birthday parties unless they happen the day of when that originally occurred because any time after you're just an afterthought and it's a gift grab.", "Not telling your wedding guests that you're already married is shitty no matter what the intentions", "It's no one's business, that you are correct. But I'm sure you know that a least in this case,  the reason they are hiding is because they know two things will happen, less people going and less gifts, and that's why they keep it a secret, otherwise they would have told everyone that matters about the eloping.", "Everyone saying op is the AH is talking about how before their wedding they signed paperwork to make it official. This is not that. They planned a wedding that is still months to a year out and just decided they didn't want to wait and want to also keep it secret that they're married. OP is perfectly alright in her feelings that that's fucked up.", "Pretty entitled to think anyone is owed that info", ">They're going to still hold the large wedding next year and invite hundreds of people, many of which would travel from out of town. But they're keeping it secret that they're already hitched. The first thing out of my mouth when my bf told me was that I thought that was kind of fucked up.\n\nI don\u00b4t know where you get this from, but it clearly says the \"large wedding\" (whatever this consists of?) happens next year. Not everyone has a religious ceremony in the first place. MAybe they have an officiant, maybe they have a pastor, maybe they have a flying horse.\n\nAs long as we don\u00b4t have information on what the \"large wedding\" consists of, it is not fair to downplay it to a \"big party\". It\u00b4s obviously going to be a wedding as per the post.", "I didn't see the post say anything like this. Are there comments elsewhere that say this?", "Similarly, there are other cultures in the world where weddings don't take place the way they do in the US. In some of these cultures, if you don't have leftover cash gifts after the wedding, you did something wrong in organizing it.", "If the party doesn't happen on their 1 year anniversary, will they consider the party date their anniversary date or the day they got married? \n\nThey are free to hold their party on whatever day they want, but also the guests are free to consider that their wedding day or just a party.", "That's a very bright observation. It's totally comparable to weddings given that couples get married every year until the day they die.", "Why? What do they miss out on? What do you miss out on? What does it change about the wedding? It's still completing the full ceremony. It's still a wedding. It's still a celebration. Just don't go to weddings if you need them to be having to sign the paperwork on the exact specific date of the wedding since apparently that's the part you're going for anyway. Smfh", "I'd assume they would want people to come and celebrate with them. Plus we don't know who all has helped fund this wedding. You go ahead with your ideas though", "If you're inviting people to a party, you kinda owe them the relevant information for that party. They also need to now the time and place, even though other strangers aren't entitled to that info.", "I get that. I was curious, though, as to why even as a celebration party, you feel it would be less important than signing a legal document? Personally I think the administrative part is much less memorable than having family and friends celebrate with you.", "I went to honeymoon 1 year after my wedding. Does that count as honeymoon or was it just a holiday then?", "You miss out on the couple showing respect for you as a guest. You go to be a part of a meaningful day in their lives when they start living as a married couple. If they've already done that, they should have the decency to say that. I'm not going to a bachelorette party for a friend who's been married for a year. I would try to go and celebrate them as well, but I might not rearrange my life in the same way as I would for a wedding.", "I'm not denying that, but you pointed out another important fact, who's funding it. Will they do it or get someone else to do it under a false premise? As I keep pointing out, my issue is not eloping (I'm actually a big proponent of it), is the secrecy...", "If it was a special holiday, you could call it a honeymoon although I wouldn't. If you do that type of holiday every year or often, it certainly isn't a honeymoon.\n\nEdit: The couple can call the party whatever they want, but it's not the wedding day anymore. And if you go back to my original comment, I didn't slam the couple. Just called them assholes if they don't tell people they are already married."]}
