You both have the right to protect your children from any toxic behavior, even if it means shielding them from family.", "NTA. You have a responsibility for the emotional well-being of your children. If there is any chance that your parents will make them feel less wanted and loved because of race then you have to protect them from that, especially as they are adopted. \n\nTheir emotional needs outweigh any opinions your parents have about heritage and race.", "NTA\n\nDon't have these people around your children.\n\nShame on your parents.", "NTA- you need to protect your family from a toxic environment, even if it is family.", "NTA at all.

It must be so difficult to make this decision, no one wants to cut their own parents off. Most people can\u2019t do it and end up causing more harm. Your children are so lucky to have you as a father. Your husband is also so lucky to be married to you.\n\nI\u2019m sure dealing with race issues from the outside world is hard enough, I can\u2019t imagine how hurtful it is when it\u2019s coming from your own parents.

Genes and Skin above all else\n- no humanity.", "NTA. Until your parents have genuinely *showed* you that they do not think that way anymore, they're not safe around your kids. Their begrudgingly agreeing not to act like they do not disapprove of you, your husband, and your children does not mean anything. Something will come out or their attitude will eventually make something clear to your kids that isn't right. They're ex-fosters, too, they're going to have an overactive radar for rejection. If they were not adopted, I would suggest that you could be around them for family occasions where there's always a buffer, but with your kids' issues, that's still too risky. If your sister is more receptive, it's probably a good idea to foster a relationship between them and their aunt. I know no-contact is hard, OP. But your kids come first, and it seems like you know that. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nYour parents have proven they don't love your kids and your kids should not be around people like that.", "NTA\n\nSorry that you're going through that but your parents bigotry is not your fault, and until they can prove that they can get over it, I see no problem with refusing to expose your children to that hatred.", "Based on your assessment of the circumstances - NTA.  It would be unhealthy for the children, especially your 4-year-old daughter to experience a situation where she would feel slighted by your parents.  Little ones have a keen sense for bad vibes.  \n\n\nMoving forward, all you can do is try to remain positive about what the future holds for your relationship with your parents.  People can and do change, especially when children are involved.  Time may soften their hearts.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem your parents really changed at all. Do what lets you live in peace. Be happy with you husband and kids. Life is too short.", "NTA Sometimes you just need to cut out the infection (your parents.) \nOn another note, I\u2019m not sure where you are, but here in the US you can \u201cadopt a grandparent\u201d if the kids having a grandma and grandpa is really important to you. Basically it\u2019s a program where older adults (grandparent age) can mentor kids. It\u2019s a lot of fun and great for both the kids and the older people. Another option would be to every other week go visit a nursing home and hang out with the residents. Most of them would love it and you\u2019d still be exposing your kids to doting older adults, while teaching them great life skills too!", "NTA. How could you be? You adopted children and gave them a loving home and your parents only care about the race? Wow. It doesnt mean you hate your own race at all.", "NTA.  It may not be permanent, but they need to think it is if they are ever going to change.  Your kids have enough going on with their trauma to have to deal with AH relatives bitching that they are white.  \n\n\nCut them off and re-evaluate in a few years if you're up to it.", "Thanks a lot, but I honestly wish I did this sooner. The red flags were everywhere. When me and my husband started thinking of having children, my mother kept on prompting us to have a surrogacy with a black woman. It was really stressful to get them to accept that we were adopting instead.\n\nRegardless, again my priority is my children. My daughter in particular needs a lot of assistance and she's doing so so well. I'm not going to risk that by having difficult grandparents in her life. It's probably better to have no grandparents than grandparents that treat you as an outsider.\n\nMy children were neglected, they need all the love possible. And if my family isn't going to give that, I'll glady cut them off, temporarily or permanently", "Yeah exactly. They even had the nerve to say that my children were privileged to my sister. Children in care are some of the most disadvantaged people on this earth, my best friend grew up in care and dealt with so many unimaginable things. I'm a primary school teacher and it's heart breaking when there's a child from a bad background. I'm definitely gonna cut them off for a long while", "I\u2019m so sad that they have treated you and your family like this!! None of you deserve to feel like that. You\u2019re making the right decision, your parents are adults. They are equipped with the mental capacity to cope with this. Your children are already struggling with their own experiences and you and your husband are working hard to help them. I\u2019m so proud of you for recognizing that and putting them first. I\u2019m sad that your parents aren\u2019t considering your daughter\u2019s trauma and how their actions may impact her development.", "as someone with grandparents like that, I can assure, they aren't missing anything.

Bigotry is bigotry, and you have every right to stamp that shit out.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry your parents are racist.  It\u2019s difficult to deal with when it\u2019s family and their views are pretty horrible.", "NTA. I had a scenario play out in my life that is somewhat similar, to a degree. I'm white, have a black girlfriend, and a mixed son. I haven't talked to my mothers parents in 3 years because when they heard I had a black girlfriend they lost their fucking minds. It was a huge problem..... until they heard she was pregnant. Now all of a sudden they've changed and want to meet my family. Fuck that, my kids my priority, as your kids are yours. Don't even give them the fucking chance. They haven't changed, they're just pissed someone's finally giving them some consequences to a lifetime of being insufferable assholes. Thats the part they dont like. You've made it clear you did not like their behavior, they didn't care. Queue consequences and crying about how it's not fair, of course.", "Your parents are racist homophobes. Absolutely NTA and you should have cut them off/out years ago! Being blood doesn't give them a right to be involved in your life if they can't respect you.\nBest of luck!", "NTA. Remember, no grandparents are still better than toxic grandparents.", "NTA, you're right. Your kids don't need grandparents like that. I wish you and your little family all the happiness.", "NTA Think of the comments they\u2019d have for your kids if they were around them.", "NTA - my parents have \u201cadopted\u201d a lot of older children who now have families of their own and they call them grandma & grandpa. You are right, your children come first and they don\u2019t need them or that negativity in their lives. So if you need real grandparents, let me know so my mom & dad can be that!

I\u2019m an Indian woman, married to a white woman with a white child and a Hispanic child. My sister is child free. We aren\u2019t continuing the family line biologically. As much as I love my parents, i will never let my kids hear anything about that. Thankfully my parents don\u2019t seem to care anymore about it. Please take care of yourself and your kiddos. Lean into your husband. Good luck and be well.", "NTA Your parents are toxic. They hurt you, they hurt your husband and if they're around your children they'll hurt your children too. You're absolutely right, your children are your first priority and you are doing the right thing by protecting them from your parents. Maybe they'll change and you can have a healthy relationship with them, maybe not, but protect your kids and husband.", "NTA. None of you need that energy in your lives.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to set boundaries to protect yourself and your family. If those boundaries include distance from your parents, so be it.", "NTA. You need to do what's right for your kids, and it's clear that having your parents around is not what's right for them.", "It\u2019s cute that you have faith in humanity which can be lost.", "Seconding this -- OP, your parents' African cultural traditions don't have to be lost just because the family you've built happens to be white.\n\nRace obviously matters. It affects how you move through the world, and is deeply entwined with the cultures we grow up in. That said, your kids can still have that connection to your ancestry, whether or not it looks quite the same as yours.\n\nI'm 1/4 Asian, raised completely American, and completely white passing. Effectively, genetics aside, I'm in the same position as your kids -- white American kid with a PoC parent.\n\nIn mixed or blended families, there is no easy answer regarding race or cultural heritage. I don't think it's my genetics alone that determine my ethnic or cultural identity; having cousins with those same genetics (3/4 white, 1/4 asian) but who are PoC while I am white demonstrates this pretty clearly. I do make efforts to connect with my Asian heritage, often with my mother, sometimes on my own because it makes me a more well rounded person. In the end, I try not to think of it as either/or, but both/and.\n\nRegardless of your relationship with your parents, I think your kids would be enriched by you sharing your African roots with them, and by passing down your cultural traditions. Not everyone will understand it from the outside, but you and your family will know that love and richness, and that's what counts.\n\nNTA", "It is hanging on by a thread", "You sound like an awesome and caring dad! NTA", "I'm sorry that your parents have such a narrow view of parenthood, and that they don't seem to be able to look past skin color in order to have a relationship with children that want and need love. You and your partner are making painful choices, which is what parents do, and by doing it with love you are being terrific parents, and I wish you all the best. \n\nBut also, surrogacy is such a controversial topic because of the almost required financial inequality between the surrogate and the parents - especially amongst women of color, who have had their bodies used against their will (see here: economic coercion) for so much of history. I'm really, really happy you made a choice to adopt instead of participating in a system that I'm sure we're going to see as inhumane in a generation or two."]}
