If they were not adopted, I would suggest that you could be around them for family occasions where there's always a buffer, but with your kids' issues, that's still too risky. If your sister is more receptive, it's probably a good idea to foster a relationship between them and their aunt. I know no-contact is hard, OP.

Basically it\u2019s a program where older adults (grandparent age) can mentor kids. It\u2019s a lot of fun and great for both the kids and the older people. Another option would be to every other week go visit a nursing home and hang out with the residents. Most of them would love it and you\u2019d still be exposing your kids to doting older adults, while teaching them great life skills too!", "NTA. How could you be? You adopted children and gave them a loving home and your parents only care about the race? Wow. It doesnt mean you hate your own race at all.", "NTA.  It may not be permanent, but they need to think it is if they are ever going to change.  Your kids have enough going on with their trauma to have to deal with AH relatives bitching that they are white.  \n\n\nCut them off and re-evaluate in a few years if you're up to it.", "Thanks a lot, but I honestly wish I did this sooner. The red flags were everywhere. When me and my husband started thinking of having children, my mother kept on prompting us to have a surrogacy with a black woman. It was really stressful to get them to accept that we were adopting instead.\n\nRegardless, again my priority is my children. My daughter in particular needs a lot of assistance and she's doing so so well. I'm not going to risk that by having difficult grandparents in her life. It's probably better to have no grandparents than grandparents that treat you as an outsider.\n\nMy children were neglected, they need all the love possible.

Children in care are some of the most disadvantaged people on this earth, my best friend grew up in care and dealt with so many unimaginable things.

I'm definitely gonna cut them off for a long while", "I\u2019m so sad that they have treated you and your family like this!! None of you deserve to feel like that. You\u2019re making the right decision, your parents are adults. They are equipped with the mental capacity to cope with this.

I'm white, have a black girlfriend, and a mixed son. I haven't talked to my mothers parents in 3 years because when they heard I had a black girlfriend they lost their fucking minds. It was a huge problem..... until they heard she was pregnant. Now all of a sudden they've changed and want to meet my family. Fuck that, my kids my priority, as your kids are yours. Don't even give them the fucking chance. They haven't changed, they're just pissed someone's finally giving them some consequences to a lifetime of being insufferable assholes.

It affects how you move through the world, and is deeply entwined with the cultures we grow up in. That said, your kids can still have that connection to your ancestry, whether or not it looks quite the same as yours.\n\nI'm 1/4 Asian, raised completely American, and completely white passing. Effectively, genetics aside, I'm in the same position as your kids -- white American kid with a PoC parent.\n\nIn mixed or blended families, there is no easy answer regarding race or cultural heritage. I don't think it's my genetics alone that determine my ethnic or cultural identity; having cousins with those same genetics (3/4 white, 1/4 asian) but who are PoC while I am white demonstrates this pretty clearly. I do make efforts to connect with my Asian heritage, often with my mother, sometimes on my own because it makes me a more well rounded person. In the end, I try not to think of it as either/or, but both/and.\n\nRegardless of your relationship with your parents, I think your kids would be enriched by you sharing your African roots with them, and by passing down your cultural traditions. Not everyone will understand it from the outside, but you and your family will know that love and richness, and that's what counts.\n\nNTA", "It is hanging on by a thread", "You sound like an awesome and caring dad!

You and your partner are making painful choices, which is what parents do, and by doing it with love you are being terrific parents, and I wish you all the best. \n\nBut also, surrogacy is such a controversial topic because of the almost required financial inequality between the surrogate and the parents - especially amongst women of color, who have had their bodies used against their will (see here: economic coercion) for so much of history. I'm really, really happy you made a choice to adopt instead of participating in a system that I'm sure we're going to see as inhumane in a generation or two.", "NTA\n\nYou never stop learning I guess lol. I had to google that \"bounty bar\" bit.", "As an adopted child - no. You're putting them first and, for your daughter especially, that's so important for them to see!  Being adopted can really give you a feeling of misplacement and if there's a family member who gives you good reason to feel misplaced, well, that's not just going to vanish.

Yeah, they've got quite a few older figures in the family. My husband has 5 siblings and they are all older than him, and all really supportive, so they should be handy.", "Yeah, rejection is a big big deal for my daughter. Her and her brother were both neglected, so it's really their psychological sticking point. My sister is great, she doesn't want kids of her own but she would really love to be an aunt to my children. She already sees them fairly regularly and my daughter has really taken keen to her which is important for her to have a female role model", "They really are.

The only stressful thing in her life right now is her parents.

It was actually the first thing that got my son's attention haha, I showed him a photo of me and my husbands honeymoon photo with the elephants, and he loves elephants. I've made traditional food (Ugali) with my daughter and it helped her slowly acclimate to me.\n\nThey may not have African blood, but I'm not going to exclude them from my culture.

People will literally go to places in Ukraine to have a cheaper surrogate. Its turning a woman into a commodity, and children too. I don't see why people are obsessed about having their children be biological, I don't care in the slightest about my DNA, I see that view as archaic.\n\nBut yeah enough of my anti-surrogacy rant haha. Thanks for the encouragement!", "For sure. Even adults can if they are perceptive enough. My children were neglected by their birth parents, so that sense of rejection will be even higher and overactive for them", "More commonly, its framed as 'it takes a village'. Ugh", "Just wanted to throw in - I would do surrogacy specifically bc I was adopted. I have an amazing family, and would perhaps adopt as well, but that's definitely a personal \"goal\" I would want to do all that I could for. It's pretty unfair to dismiss that as archaic when ppl are overall mostly a result of their genes vs their parenting. That's usually said to alleviate parents of stress but I'm not sure it has that effect \ud83d\ude02\n\nNot saying anything about your choice but just pointing out you might want to temper your position. Everyone has their own reasons. I mean actual adoption is financially prohibitive for some, too.", "Oh yeah I was definitely being hyperbolic, I apologise for that.\n\nThere's many situations where surrogacy is an amazing thing for people, and yeah biological connection is important to most. Not something that bothers me but I can understand it. Even from the gay angle I understand it.

The kid learned the truth after he got into trouble at school one day and his \"mom\" came to get him; she wound up getting into a physical fight with the principal, was arrested, and then had a heart attack while in police custody and died. The bio mom kept coming to court and saying that she definitely wanted her son and agreeing to do whatever was necessary to get him back, but she never once followed through. One day, when I was there for my regular visit, he looked at me and asked why his mother didn't want him; I tell you, my heart just broke into a thousand tiny shards (I'm sure you can imagine). I had to take a few seconds to get myself under control \u2013 I didn't want to burst into tears and scare him or make him feel worse \u2013 and then I told him that I was very sorry, but I couldn't explain it to him because I couldn't understand it myself, that I thought he was wonderful, and he absolutely deserved to be loved and wanted and cherished. \n\n(He *was* a troubled kid who struggled to control his anger, but that was hardly surprising given everything he'd experienced. He was *also* very sweet, thoughtful, kind-hearted, generous, and loving. When he learned that I had a dog, he wanted to meet her; I explained to him that she had been terribly abused by her previous owner, and she was very skittish and easily scared, so if I brought her to meet him, he had to promise to be on his best behavior \u2013 calm, quiet, and gentle; no sudden movements, loud voices, etc. He promised, so I brought her, and he was as good as his word \u2013 he could not have been more gentle with her, and she loved him, and he was so happy when he started to pet her and she leaned into him and looked into his eyes and wagged her tail.)\n\nBless you and your husband for opening your hearts and your home to children who needed both, and I hope you will all enjoy many happy years together.
