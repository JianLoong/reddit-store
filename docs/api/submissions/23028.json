Their begrudgingly agreeing not to act like they do not disapprove of you, your husband, and your children does not mean anything.

If they were not adopted, I would suggest that you could be around them for family occasions where there's always a buffer, but with your kids' issues, that's still too risky. If your sister is more receptive, it's probably a good idea to foster a relationship between them and their aunt. I know no-contact is hard, OP.

Basically it\u2019s a program where older adults (grandparent age) can mentor kids. It\u2019s a lot of fun and great for both the kids and the older people. Another option would be to every other week go visit a nursing home and hang out with the residents. Most of them would love it and you\u2019d still be exposing your kids to doting older adults, while teaching them great life skills too!", "NTA. How could you be? You adopted children and gave them a loving home and your parents only care about the race? Wow. It doesnt mean you hate your own race at all.", "NTA.  It may not be permanent, but they need to think it is if they are ever going to change.  Your kids have enough going on with their trauma to have to deal with AH relatives bitching that they are white.  \n\n\nCut them off and re-evaluate in a few years if you're up to it.", "Thanks a lot, but I honestly wish I did this sooner. The red flags were everywhere. When me and my husband started thinking of having children, my mother kept on prompting us to have a surrogacy with a black woman. It was really stressful to get them to accept that we were adopting instead.\n\nRegardless, again my priority is my children. My daughter in particular needs a lot of assistance and she's doing so so well. I'm not going to risk that by having difficult grandparents in her life. It's probably better to have no grandparents than grandparents that treat you as an outsider.\n\nMy children were neglected, they need all the love possible.

Children in care are some of the most disadvantaged people on this earth, my best friend grew up in care and dealt with so many unimaginable things.

I'm definitely gonna cut them off for a long while", "I\u2019m so sad that they have treated you and your family like this!! None of you deserve to feel like that. You\u2019re making the right decision, your parents are adults. They are equipped with the mental capacity to cope with this.

I'm white, have a black girlfriend, and a mixed son. I haven't talked to my mothers parents in 3 years because when they heard I had a black girlfriend they lost their fucking minds. It was a huge problem..... until they heard she was pregnant. Now all of a sudden they've changed and want to meet my family. Fuck that, my kids my priority, as your kids are yours. Don't even give them the fucking chance. They haven't changed, they're just pissed someone's finally giving them some consequences to a lifetime of being insufferable assholes.

It affects how you move through the world, and is deeply entwined with the cultures we grow up in. That said, your kids can still have that connection to your ancestry, whether or not it looks quite the same as yours.\n\nI'm 1/4 Asian, raised completely American, and completely white passing. Effectively, genetics aside, I'm in the same position as your kids -- white American kid with a PoC parent.\n\nIn mixed or blended families, there is no easy answer regarding race or cultural heritage. I don't think it's my genetics alone that determine my ethnic or cultural identity; having cousins with those same genetics (3/4 white, 1/4 asian) but who are PoC while I am white demonstrates this pretty clearly. I do make efforts to connect with my Asian heritage, often with my mother, sometimes on my own because it makes me a more well rounded person. In the end, I try not to think of it as either/or, but both/and.\n\nRegardless of your relationship with your parents, I think your kids would be enriched by you sharing your African roots with them, and by passing down your cultural traditions. Not everyone will understand it from the outside, but you and your family will know that love and richness, and that's what counts.\n\nNTA", "It is hanging on by a thread", "You sound like an awesome and caring dad!

You and your partner are making painful choices, which is what parents do, and by doing it with love you are being terrific parents, and I wish you all the best. \n\nBut also, surrogacy is such a controversial topic because of the almost required financial inequality between the surrogate and the parents - especially amongst women of color, who have had their bodies used against their will (see here: economic coercion) for so much of history. I'm really, really happy you made a choice to adopt instead of participating in a system that I'm sure we're going to see as inhumane in a generation or two.", "NTA\n\nYou never stop learning I guess lol. I had to google that \"bounty bar\" bit.", "As an adopted child - no. You're putting them first and, for your daughter especially, that's so important for them to see!  Being adopted can really give you a feeling of misplacement and if there's a family member who gives you good reason to feel misplaced, well, that's not just going to vanish.

Yeah, they've got quite a few older figures in the family. My husband has 5 siblings and they are all older than him, and all really supportive, so they should be handy.", "Yeah, rejection is a big big deal for my daughter. Her and her brother were both neglected, so it's really their psychological sticking point. My sister is great, she doesn't want kids of her own but she would really love to be an aunt to my children. She already sees them fairly regularly and my daughter has really taken keen to her which is important for her to have a female role model", "They really are.

The only stressful thing in her life right now is her parents.

It was actually the first thing that got my son's attention haha, I showed him a photo of me and my husbands honeymoon photo with the elephants, and he loves elephants. I've made traditional food (Ugali) with my daughter and it helped her slowly acclimate to me.\n\nThey may not have African blood, but I'm not going to exclude them from my culture.

People will literally go to places in Ukraine to have a cheaper surrogate. Its turning a woman into a commodity, and children too. I don't see why people are obsessed about having their children be biological, I don't care in the slightest about my DNA, I see that view as archaic.\n\nBut yeah enough of my anti-surrogacy rant haha. Thanks for the encouragement!", "For sure. Even adults can if they are perceptive enough. My children were neglected by their birth parents, so that sense of rejection will be even higher and overactive for them", "More commonly, its framed as 'it takes a village'. Ugh", "Just wanted to throw in - I would do surrogacy specifically bc I was adopted. I have an amazing family, and would perhaps adopt as well, but that's definitely a personal \"goal\" I would want to do all that I could for. It's pretty unfair to dismiss that as archaic when ppl are overall mostly a result of their genes vs their parenting. That's usually said to alleviate parents of stress but I'm not sure it has that effect \ud83d\ude02\n\nNot saying anything about your choice but just pointing out you might want to temper your position. Everyone has their own reasons. I mean actual adoption is financially prohibitive for some, too.", "Oh yeah I was definitely being hyperbolic, I apologise for that.\n\nThere's many situations where surrogacy is an amazing thing for people, and yeah biological connection is important to most. Not something that bothers me but I can understand it. Even from the gay angle I understand it.

People might be assuming that I'm American and if that was the case they would have a point since there's a lot of black guys in America, it would look like I'm avoiding them.", "Husband making you a traitor is not really the same thing as a race traitor, though.", "The child who does not receive the warmth of the village will burn it down to feel it.", "Why/why not any child?", "Thanks so much! That actually means a lot to me haha. Its something that's good to have when you are adopting, as children can be very difficult, especially when they have trauma. Obviously it's not their fault, but it can get mentally tiring. My daughter in particular requires a lot of patience and understanding", "Yeah, I hate being African so much that I go to my homeland every 6 months, and went there for my honeymoon. My heritage is so vile that I pass it on to my children.\n\nFind someone more gullible to annoy, and stop talking about race issues when you don't know what you are talking about. Having LGBT+ POC friends doesn't give you a pass to be racist \ud83d\udc4d", "Would you mind sharing what African country this is, as I am struggling to recall one that isn't aggressively homophobic. \n\nLol. What did I say that was racist? Don't worry, Reddit is pr\u00e9dominantly white with users of limited experience, so you will \"win\" online, which is what you wanted.", "Where I live in Australia, altruistic surrogacy is the only legal kind. Before I decided against it (ironically *because* of my DNA), I was blessed enough to have three friends say to me that they would be willing to carry my child, and they all have a special place in my heart.", "First you're telling me that \"African heritage is not less than European heritage\" and now you are shaming me for being proud of my heritage by saying that my country is homophobic.\n\nYour white knighting, white saviour complex is the racist thing. Telling me, a black man, to sit down and shut up about my own experiences, because everyone knows that you, a non black person, knows infinitely more about the inner workings of black racism, and better yet, inner black conflicts.\n\nPlease, enlighten me. What should I pick? Self hating black that sells myself to white people, or self hating gay for being proud of my African heritage? Because you are clearly the expert here", "No, I was genuinely curious. The only country in Africa where the LGBTQIA+ has some rights is South Africa, and even there, there is rampant abuse against homosexual men and women. The friends I mentioned, some are African, and they cannot go, as it is too dangerous. Look up the abuses and legislation against the gay community in countries like Egypt, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Some of the major countries in the North, South, East, and West, and look at their legislation. Look at what happened when Obama went to Kenya and addressed the country for its LGBTQIA+ laws. \n\nI do not recall telling you once to shut up, nor how to feel. In addition, I never stated my race, so maybe not assume? Not sure what I am the savior of.", "This conversation is going nowhere, let's just end it here. You continue to patronise me by telling me facts about anti gay laws in Africa, as if me, a gay African, wouldn't know about it.\n\nIf you are genuinely curious, I come from Tanzania. Not pro gay at all. Me and my husband decided to have our honeymoon there, we didn't get any backlash since me and my husband never really do public signs of affection so we passed fine.\n\nAnyway, I'm done with throwing insults at each other. Let's chill out and leave it. Have a nice day/night", "NTA. Bless you and your husband for making a home for two children who need all the love and support they can get. If your parents cannot accept your children or your husband because of their race, it is best to go no-contact with your folks. It is impossible to fathom why they think they are entitled to a relationship with people they wish weren't there. \n\nI would suggest your parents fulfill their need to support the black community by opening their own home to black children in need, but from what you said, they would not be good influences on those children.", "NTA!\n\nWell done, OP!", "NTA. Your children are the priority. You are doing the right thing.", "NTA  Thank you for looking after your kids.  You're being a good dad.", "Bitching about your husband and children behind your back still, a year after the adoption, years after the marriage?  This is a really ugly situation and as sad as it is, I think you're doing the right thing keeping your folks from bringing that mindset into your nuclear family.\n\nYou sound like a wonderful, caring dad, and you're putting the welfare of your children and your marriage first.  As well you should.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are protecting your babies and your family...that's called doing the right thing. A painful, but appropriate choice.", "Protect your babies. You are NOT TA.", "NTA, wow, your parents are really racist.. yikes", "NTA", "NTA.  Protect the children - always!", "[Faith lost](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158fm4j/aita_for_forbidding_mym41_parentsm64f61_from/jtbrwm5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)", "Yuck.

Mine had all passed away before I was born. My gma\u2019s sisters acted in a grandparent capacity and I was/am extremely close with them. Additionally, my mom befriended an older couple she knew from frequenting their business and they sort of just adopted us as extra grandkids. We called them grandma and grandpa, they invited us to holidays with their actual biological grandkids, always stopped by with presents whether it was Easter, birthdays, etc. They even attended grandparents day at elementary school when our Great Aunts were unable to travel to be here for it. \n\nMy sister has an elderly couple who live across the street from her who have become an extra set of grandparents to my nieces. They have them over for dinner, gift them things, attend their school plays and sports games, take the girls on fun outings now and then, and are just trusted people my nieces can go to if there\u2019s ever an emergency, etc. \n\nIf you\u2019re willing to let them, I\u2019m sure there are people in your orbit who would gladly step up to be the grandparents your family deserves.", "NTA. It wouldn\u2019t be healthy for your children to be around grandparents who have a problem with them and might even dislike them.", "NTA\n\nLook for surrogate grandparents, people aged 60+ who do not have (grand)children of their own and whom you know and trust who are willing to take on the role of grandparents.", "NTA- no grandparents is ENDLESSLY better than grandparents who implant self-hatred for life. Don't let them weasel their way out of this.", "Nta they do know there are white Africans right?", "Are you one of his parents? You've commented more than OP under this post.", "Are you one of his parents?", "NTA. Remember, no grandparents are still better than toxic grandparents.", "Yeah, not sure why they're down voting. I get what you mean racism is about discrimination and POC can discriminate too. Structural racism is also a thing too.", "NTA in any way shape or form! Shame on your parents for being so hateful toward innocent children! Shame on your parents for being hateful toward your husband all because they are white. Come on people happiness and love are what matter! You keep on loving your family and don\u2019t concern yourself with the hate.", "NTA. \n\n>My children are my priority\n\nYour priorities are correct. The risk is too great that your parents will mistreat your children, or repeat these horrible things to them.", "NTA\n\nThis is a form of racism just FYI. As a gay man, they're treating you like a woman jn this situation. Racists of all different races and ethnicities believe that men of their race/ethnicity can date outside of it. But that women of their race/ethnicity can only date within their race/ethnicity, and not doing this is a betrayal of their race/ethnicity. Which sounds identical to what they said about you\n\nSo, they are homophobic, as they're viewing you as a woman, because you're a gay man (a very common view from 20 to 30 years back). And they're also racists for their views of racial dating", "NTA. Who know what awful things they might say to your kids in private.  Going NC makes sense now, you can revisit it later if the situation changes.", "I\u2019ve been seeing more racism from black people recently.", "It is for most people though, white children are statistically far more likely to be adopted. If you\u2019re a white child with no clear physical/mental impairments you will literally be adopted first just because of physical attributes.", "I didn't build, nor condone the structure."]}
