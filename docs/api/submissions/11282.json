I pay my boyfriend half of the market rate rent, which we update every year by looking how much the flats are being rented out for in the building complex. Which is a lot of money, but I agreed to it. Other than this, we did everything else 50-50 in the past.\n\nI got a new job with a significant pay increase and now my boyfriend says we should start splitting expenses proportional to income, because that's fair. \n\nI told him I don't think it's fair that I should start paying for more, just because I got a new job and nothing else changed. I already pay him rent - enough rent that would get me a same-sized flat a few streets away - so it's more than fair to him.\n\nHe made some -in my opinion very weak- arguments and accused me of ripping him off. That's when I told him that under no circumstances we will split expenses proportional to income.\n\nNow that I've calmed down a bit, I'm worried whether I'm in the wrong. Especially since my best friend told me that this is how they do it with her boyfriend too and my boyfriend owning the flat is irrelevant here.

There\u2019s communal expenses you split 50/50? And then on top of that you pay him half the average rent for a place that costs him NOTHING because he already owns it and it is fully paid off? So he makes money off of you?! And now he wants you to pay even more?\n\nLook, I generally think splitting bills proportionately is the most fair system. But that\u2019s when people rent a place together. Or have to pay a mortgage together. There\u2019s bills to be paid, nobody profits off the other one. Your situation is completely different and in your case there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever agree to a proportional split. NTA.", "NTA. Are you including his rent from you in his income?

I dont have a problem with him charging you some rent even if its paid off, BUT a cohabitation space should be mutually beneficial arraingement to both parties.

Your boyfriend is either very confused (if we're being extremely charitable) or he's awful. There's nothing wrong with splitting expenses proportionally to income, but there are two keywords in that concept -- \"splitting\" and \"expenses.\"\n\nWhen a couple is splitting expenses, you look at the whole pool of expenses and decide how to share them. Rent (or mortgage), utilities, car payments, food, daycare, phone, whatever. And there's tons of reasonable ways to split them. Proportional to income makes a lot of sense, especially if there's a disparity in income. But you can only agree to split expenses that way if you're not paying him rent. Rent isn't an expense you have, as a couple. He doesn't have a mortgage. He has homeowner's insurance, maybe a condo fee, and upkeep costs for the home, and it would be totally reasonable use that in the calculation.\n\nBut by paying him rent, you're probably not splitting expenses at all. If you're paying him market rent, that's paying probably all of his home ownership costs. So currently, you're paying (and this is a guess, it depends on your rent) the entire cost of insurance, all of the condo fees, the entire electric bill, the entire gas bill ... maybe more.\n\nI don't know if it's intentional, but you're being taken advantage of.

You are already figuring out what the \"market\" rental rate is for the property. Add that rate (100%, not 50%) to his estimated income, then also include that amount in your household bills to be split.  Effectively you are now BOTH paying rent to him.

If he had a mortgage, proper rent makes sense, but never to pay more than the person who owns it!!

I'm sure they're very happy with their money now though. They own 2 or three (fully paid off) homes in that extremely pricy city, so they're raking it in. \n\n***OH I JUST REMEMBERED***: When they told us about our rent raising by 50% (before we told them the law) they tried to tug at our heartstrings by telling us they had been driving an old beater and wanted to get a new car so our rent increase would help them with that. Can you BELIEVE the GALL???? They own several rental homes and we're a poor couple barely scraping by in a rental and THEY want US to feel bad for them??? WOW."]}
