My mom knew about this secret for years and had decided to keep it from me and my brother (20M).  \nThe worst part is, this affair must've happened as my brother was about 2. Mack is only a few months older than me.\r\r  \nMy mom wanted me to forgive my dad and try to accept this other family into our lives.

She deceived you and now you know (not even by them telling you but because you figured it out on your own), but it's your process how you deal with it.\n\nYour feelings are valid. It's okay to be mad and sad.  \n\n>Is it wrong for me to want some distance from my dad while I process everything?\n\nNo, absolutely not. It's actually really good to keep your distance for a while when you want to process things. And when the time comes, when you want it, you can talk to your dad. And your mom.", "NTA. Your mom was deceptive too and has no right to ask for your forgiveness. Take the time you need to process this; talk to a therapist or the school social worker. Work through your emotions, and grieve. When you\u2019ve done so, evaluate with a clearer head whether to forgive him. You do not have to forgive this: this is a massive betrayal on his part, and you said nothing about his being remorseful. Remember that, if you do forgive, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to keep him in your life.", "A mistake is something that happens and everyone recognises was wrong but it\u2019s done. A deceit is an ongoing behaviour trait. \n\nA second family is not a \u2018mistake\u2019 it\u2019s a deceit. When your parents say \u2018second family\u2019 is your dad actively partaking in a role in this family?! Why is your mother defending this? There is a possibility that your mother may have dependancy issues or something similar. This is not normal. NTA\n\nEdit spelling", "That\u2019s a lot to process!  If you\u2019re able to access therapy, that might help you work through how you feel and start sorting out what you want.  Given that big shake-up of your life, it is absolutely okay to prioritize your mental health and ask for some space to process.  NTA", "NTA i would be so pissed if i was u ong", "NTA.\n\nYou're on the edge of becoming an adult, meaning that you're old enough to decide who you want to associate with, and that includes family.\n\nYou're not obligated to forgive him, or to interact with the family both of your parents hid from you your entire life. Being related does not give someone a free pass to your forgiveness.", "NTA\n\nFirst, your mom needs to back off. She\u2019s had nearly 20 years to process her emotions, you\u2019ve had all of 20 seconds. Second, I imagine the three of you (you, Mack, and your brother) being PISSED at the degree and habit of lying the adults had to carry on all these years to keep you three apart. To know the adults were involved in actively hiding these siblings from each other is vile. You missed out on years of love, connection, and friendship (as well as squabbles and awkwardness) because of the adults in this situation. Your mother is lucky your ire hasn\u2019t included her yet (but should definitely remain primarily on your dad). \n\nAlso, if he\u2019s willing to hide the existence of at least one child, I suspect there are more (or will be).\n\nGood luck.", "NTA your family needs to give you time to process this whole mess. If your mother already knew, that means she already had her struggles and processed them. You just found out and it's all new to you. You have the right to process all of this shit.\n\nGetting out of the moralistic realm and into a more pragmatic one now. It is probably best if you don't fight against the current. If everyone else is going to accept this other family, this might isolate you from the rest of your family.", "NTA.  This is an unprecedented situation.  I think you have to handle it without your mother or anyone else weighing in on it.  No one has walked a mile in your shoes, and the fact that your mother has forgiven your father is irrelevant.  Let yourself be your guide - if you feel angry and confused, be angry and confused.  The only negative thing you can do right now is to ignore your feelings and \"forgive\" him.  Good luck.", "NTA but this kind of anger, hurt, and resentment can just end up eating you alive in the long run, and why do that to yourself?  Let your father shoulder his deserved guilt (if he\u2019s even capable of it).\n\nProtect your mental health and well being.  I\u2019m not saying \u2018right now\u2019, but you can talk to your dad and figure out your new normal.  You definitely don\u2019t have to believe anything he says and forgive him (I suspect he\u2019d just evade the truth and gaslight you anyways), but if you can approach it as doing it for yourself I think you\u2019ll navigate this awful revelation with better outcomes.", "Info.  Your father kept this from you.  Mack\u2019s parentage is apparently public, but has she always know?  Your mother knew at some point, but when?  Did your parents jointly decide to keep this from you and your brother, or did one parent demand it of the other?  Your discomfort is valid.  NTA.", "NTA. You absolutely need time and distance from him (and your Mom) while you process this. You also need help to process it. Talk to a counselor at school. Get a referral to a therapist. Don't just talk to your friends. They are ill-equipped to help you through something like this. Your brother needs the same. \n\nBest fortune to you. I know it feels absolutely crazy right now, but you WILL come out the other side of this. Listen to your heart.", "Your parents are both the ass, not you. You have every right to be upset and should give you time to even process.", "1.  You are under no obligation to forgive your father, his actions were at best despicable and the fact that he hid it from you for SEVENTEEN years shows he knew what he was doing was wrong.\n\n2.  Your mother has no right to push forgiveness since she decided to go along with this lie.  The moment she decided to help your father made her no longer the victim and just as guilty as your father imo.\n\n3.  You can\u2019t pretend like everything is okay because it is not okay.  This is a huge punch in the gut and it\u2019s not fair for everyone to expect you to just go back to some semblance of normal.\n\n1000000% NTA.  Your parents have some nerve!", "NTA. \n\nSomething like that is not a one time \u201cmistake\u201d it\u2019s a LIFETIME of lies. It\u2019s a whole fine and well that your mother forgive him, but that does not mean you have to. My dad tried so hard to force a mother daughter relationship between me and his affair partner. He overlook all of the terrible shit she didn\u2019t said to me just because he wanted a happily blended family.

Your therapist could have your parents in for part of a session  to support you in making this request. \n\nThis is an unexpected disclosure which definitely rearranges the picture you had of your family. It is a lot to deal with, for sure. But you are also catastrophizing a bit. \n\nRegardless of the circumstances which led to Mack\u2019s conception, that was an issue between your parents and they dealt with it as a couple almost two decades ago.

You need your therapist to guide you through exploring and sorting out these feelings.\n\nYour parents\u2019 decision to not reveal to you that you had a sister may not have been the best decision but maybe it was for them. I think you\u2019re old enough to have a therapist assisted discussion with them about that aspect of it. Your parents are the same people they have always been. But now you know more about them.\n\nI think you misunderstand what having a second hidden family means. Is he living with them part of the time? Is he still in a romantic and sexual relationship with Mack\u2019s mom? Does he support them beyond paying child support? Does he go on vacations with them?

You're reeling with the shock and trauma of discovering so many layers of deception in what you up until now believed about your family. Your mom may be willing to rug sweep, but that does not create an obligation for you to negate YOUR feelings. She's been complicit in this deception.

That\u2019s a lot to process, and you deserve some space to figure out what you need, what you want, and how you want to communicate those things to him and anyone else in your life affected by this.  I think it\u2019d be healthy to tell him that that\u2019s what is going on, so he understands that you\u2018re not punishing him, you\u2019re just working through things.\n\nKinda like how there\u2019s a difference between giving someone the silent treatment to punish them and asking for some space because you\u2019re having big feelings you want to sort through before you talk again.  Punishing with the silent treatment is an immature and unhealthy way of dealing with conflict, but taking space to sort out your feelings can be a very mature way of keeping conflict under control."]}
