Kids do not need to spend every day with - forgive the blunt language - a dying man. That'd be pretty rough on them, actually.\n\nI guess it would depend on the person, but I think there's a good chance your FIL also doesn't necessarily want the kids to see him every day in his increasingly bad state or feel like he has to be 'on' for the kids when he's... dying. Surely he'll want rest too?\n\nThey also shouldn't have to wonder why their dad 'doesn't want to take them anymore' because that's how it will feel.\n\nI say NAH because your ex is overwhelmed with the impending loss and she's projecting her desire to have as much time as possible with her dad onto her kids and this request. It's not reasonable, but it's not coming from an AH place either.", "NTA.   I think your kids will need the break much more then they will need the extra time with grandpa. Hospice is stressful at home, much more so then many people realize.   I was an adult when i had to deal with it and I needed breaks, children should absolutely have them.", "NTA. I\u2019d stay flexible. If while he\u2019s still feeling well enough to do things and they want to schedule something, be open to switching up a day for them to do that thing with their grandfather. Other than that, I agree with you that in general the consistency of being with you as the custody order states is pretty important. Maintaining their relationship with you and getting a break from what will be an ongoing stressful environment. As things get worse, keep that open communication. Things may need to shift, watch the kids\u2019 reactions, it may be valuable for your ex and you to consider different days/times to accommodate the children\u2019s needs. She may find out there are days/weekends it would be best for everyone for the kids to stay with you just due to the circumstances. \n\nLots of life changes, feel for everyone involved, but things are going to evolve. Making a drastic and non-flexible decision now will only hurt the kids in the long run.", "NTA specifically because you are correct that it will not be healthy for you kids. They are going to need a safe space to decompress from the grief they are going through watching a beloved family member slowly pass on. \n\nI want to point out that i think your ex has good intentions, but probably fails to realize how much of her attention is going to be focused on her father. Losing time with you will hurt them far more than spending a few extra days with their grandpa will help them. You\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NTA, they have a set routine and you were reasonable in offering to sharing holidays and birthdays. You are right, kids also need time to just be kids despite the tragedy of slowly losing their grandfather and having 1 day a week and every other weekend away is a great break for their mental health.", "NGL OP I was fully expecting to say YTA- but I\u2019m glad I read fully through your post because NTA.\n\nYour Ex is asking for a big ask and I think you\u2019re compromising well with spending holidays together. It\u2019s also a big ask for the kids to spend every weekend with their sick grandpa when they\u2019re so young, and routine is very important especially during a time when emotions are running high. \n\nI would assure your ex that if there is a special occasion or holiday that falls durning your time that you will be more than happy to make accommodations. I would also tell her that if her dad unexpectedly declines quickly and the kids are with you, you will be more than happy to take them to see him. \n\nShe\u2019s hurting right now as it sounds like her dad was an amazing man, and she will be a bit touchy. Losing a parent is so hard at any age and grief is so cruel", "NTA\n\nYou could get hit by a bus tomorrow. No one ever knows how much time they have with their loved ones, but **PARENT** trumps **GRANDPARENT**. If you only get 8 days a month, that\u2019s cheating you out of your time that is *just as precious*, if not more so, because again, YOU ARE THE PARENT. \nSometimes, as a parent you have to be \u201cselfish\u201d and by \u201cselfish\u201d, I mean, not be a People Pleaser and say \u201cI\u2019m important too.\u201d \nThey have considerably MORE days to visit with Grandpa without stealing yours.

I know plenty of divorced idiots who refused to co-parent at all, so holidays were always a really difficult time for the kids. \nI don\u2019t understand why your ex feels that she shouldn\u2019t have to give up HER TIME with the kids for HER father, when she gets so much of it.", "NTA The father in law may be dying but it isn\u2019t your responsibility it is good for them to see him before it ends and children aren\u2019t emotional support animals it is good for them to see him but you are still their guardian you even made reasonable offers", "NTA. Children are not emotional support animals. I get why he'd want them around with his father dying (and sympathy to him), but that's not really what is best for the kids. You even offered to share holidays and that's a perfectly reasonable offer.\n\nIf he gets them 5 days a week and you only have weekends his request wasn't reasonable anyway. Not even giving up a single day.", "NAH She's not an AH for asking, but you're also not an AH. Your reasoning of giving them respite from dealing with his illness is valid. However, if you notice that the kids seem especially sad when they're away from him on your days, be open to the possibility that *maybe they would* rather spend as much time with him as possible and adjust your stance on your ex's request. Just remain flexible.", "NTA. I get that your ex wants the kids to know and remember their grandfather, but that doesn\u2019t mean they should sacrifice getting time with their other parent. Especially when you\u2019re offering to change holiday schedules. \n\nPlus, they\u2019re kids. They know what\u2019s going on, but they don\u2019t fully get the grand scheme of it all. If she forces them to stop seeing their other parent and uproot their schedule for the grandfather, chances are they\u2019ll end up resenting both him and the mother. \n\nAs a kid of divorced parents, I remember getting annoyed when schedules shifted around. Stability and consistency is important when you\u2019re at that age \n\nAnd like others have said, the kids aren\u2019t there to be the ex\u2019s emotional support. They deserve to still be kids. Getting time with you away from all the grief is important in and of itself.", "NTA. Those kids will need a break from being around their dying grandfather.  Don't give in.  That's not healthy for them.", "Just my honest AH opinion but you need a new custody agreement right now. \n\nHave you ever dealt with hospice care? This is nothing that young children should be around a majority of the time. If anything, they should be with you during the week and visiting her and grandpa on the weekends. \n\nThat is too much for little kids. Their mental and emotional well being should come first. That isn't in a house with someone dying. That sounds miserable for children. \n\nNo running, playing or making noise because grandpa is sleeping. And what if he passes and one of them are the ones to find him? Hell no. \n\nYour kids absolutely do not need to be there even more than they already are. F that!\n\nNTA but I understand your ex asking because she's thinking about limited time yadda yadda but...not at the expense of the kids emotional and mental wellness.", "NTA \nIt's a difficult situation, of course, but I agree with you. They're with them the whole week and they need a break, too. \nYou could, if you want, ask for your kid's opinion. But at the end, kids need their father and only a few hours every other day it's not enough.", "NTA. agreeing to shared holidays is more than enough.", "NTA, this might be the last time you ever get to see your ex father-in-law.", "NTA. It\u2019s too much to ask. If he had a month left I\u2019d feel differently, but she can\u2019t reasonably ask you to give up 90% of your time for half a year or more.", "NTA. But if you can make an effort to build more time with their grandfather into your time with your kids, I recommend it.", "You are NTA. You have the right to time with your children. It is very kind of you to agree to changing holidays and birthdays. We did hospice for my parent at their house when my children were a little younger than yours. It is hard to see. Your children need the stability of time with you and also brief time away from their house as things get more difficult in my opinion. The Invisible Thread was a great book we read together during this time.\n\nI am sorry your ex-fil is suffering. Your ex-wife might just be trying to find control anywhere she can right now.", "NTA, it was OK for her to ask but not her reaction. Children thrive with a regular routine, you would be doing them a disservice to change things since you have no idea how long grandpa has. \nYou are correct in thinking they need a break as well, although they love grandpa this will be a very difficult time for them and they can decompress at your house.", "NTA\u2026 he could live years, you never know & you can\u2019t be expected to lose that time with your children. Further, it\u2019s probably a nice break from a potentially stressful, somber household to spend time at your home.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "So your FIL is dying and your first instinct is to put yourself first rather than him? You cannot change your schedule? \n\nCongrats on being an AH. Karma is real, you'll find yourself in the future being stuck in a hospital bed with no family to give a shit.... when or if that happens, just remember how you didn't care about your FILnor did you put anyone first before your selfish feelings.

Hope you all get through this ok, stick to your guns and try to be empathetic as possible. Maybe tell her that it's good for kids to keep routines when other things in their lives are changing.

Her expecting you to give her custody 85% of the time, for an indeterminate duration, when she already has it 70% of the time, is totally unreasonable.

It gives them some sort of normal and structure in an time that is very uncertain. \n\nAnd I also think both grandpa and the mother will need an break from the kids from time to time. It\u2019s going to be an hard time, it\u2019s going to be painful and stressful. For them as well it would be better when there are periods of time that the children are not around.

She may not want to be alone in the house with just her dad. Maybe that's too much time for her to be solely focused on him, his deteriorating health, and his imminent demise.

My son came home on the 6th late at night after the summer with his dad, his dad refused to change and a few hours later my dad died. \n\nI will literally NEVER forgive my co parent. \nMy son said he will NEVER forgive his dad for being so selfish. \n\n$15,000 later\u2026. in family therapy, co parenting therapy, therapy for my son, lawyers, etc - we finally can be slightly friends again - 3 years later. \n\nMy son, whom is a pre teen - hasn\u2019t decided if he\u2019ll go fully NC on his dad when he\u2019s 18 simply because he can\u2019t believe how selfish he was. I think they\u2019ll get through it, but it\u2019s not a guarantee.\n\n\nETA: I was willing to pay for my ex to come stay here - I offered flight, hotel, compensation, wage replacement\u2026 I offered giving him an entire Thanksgiving break he wouldn\u2019t normally get to compensate for time missed, etc.", "You know if you give that time up that custody time you legally were awarded, she could argue for full custody and use that as example/leverage?

You get so little time with them, you want them around.  Plus, the kids do need a break from watching their grandfather die.  It isn't pretty.

However asking you to drastically reduce your time with your kids for an indeterminate amount of time is not.

It\u2019s extremely difficult to watch someone you love die, and the kids will need breaks from that. They don\u2019t need to be there when it happens, they will be there enough. Never give up what little custody you have. That could be used against you in the future.", "NTA.

Your kids do not and should not be forced to be around to be the emotional support of an dying person.  She wasn't the AH for asking, but calling you selfish and unkind was.  She gets plenty of parenting time,  and I think she is being selfish to demand you give up what little time you already have.\n\nOne day a week will remove half of your time with them. She either needs to make up that time for you,  or she needs to concede and not press the matter.  \n\nThe kids are very young,  and having to watch someone deteriorate is very unkind to those children. Most parents keep their kids away from the grandparents if the grandparent is deteriorating to the point of almost being unrecognizable. \n\nI watched my grandmother get taken by COVID in a ICU,  and I was 24. It killed me to see her so pale,  thin,  and weak (she was a very robust,  cheerful,  and rosy cheeked lady). I can't imagine how a 5 and 7 year old would feel seeing something similar.  \n\nYour absolutely right that the children deserve respite from all of that.

My mom and i worked opposite shifts, so one of us was always home with my son and step dad. If there were some way my son wouldn't have had to witness it all, i would've given anything for it.

I don't know if she's that kind of person, but I personally know several people who have had it happen to them, and the partner they ceded their time to was smart enough not to leave a paper or digital trail so the supporting partner had no proof that it WASN'T abandonment.  It's a sad, terrible situation, and I feel for her.  But they live every day with grandpa, they can play with him as much as possible then.  Missing weekends so that they can spend time with their dad isn't cruel.  They need you more than they need grandpa.

Third, and probably most importantly, doing so is going to destroy what otherwise appears to be a fairly amicable co-parenting relationship, regardless of the outcome.

Though she is asking to cut their father out.  We're not talking like your robbing them of ever seeing him again.  We're talking about being able to see him 90% of the time to 100% of the time.  I feel like there's some gaslighting going on here.\n\nPLUS.  I don't know what your divorce situation is with your ex.  And I'm not saying that she's doing this.

It could be a year.  And then that detail gets lost when your in court trying to explain why you barely see the kids because you were trying to play nice.

Movie days? Something where you AND your children spend time with grandpa, or if it's fesible go out to eat, ect. \n\nJust... Make memories as a family?\n\nYou're in no way obligated to do this. That being said, it sounds like you and your ex are amicable and her dad is a decent man. So it would be NICE for you to come up with some kind of compromise. Like one outing as a family during \"your time\" every week. Mini golfing, swimming, whatever- all 5 of you, as a family, go out and do something fun. \n\nYour ex is absolutely being unreasonable wanting the kids all the time. That being said, she is grieving the upcoming loss of her only parent and grappling with the fact she will watch him die and be powerless to stop it. So she is probably not thinking rationally at the moment. When I went through this with my brother, I was a fucking wreck and thinking in black and white all the time. I was so tired and stressed it was eother good or bad, no in between. \n\nThat being said- I'd call your ex and propose some sort of compromise. Ie you all come over and hang out or go get dinner together. Again, you would not be TA for not doing this, as it's going above and beyond- but your ex is going through some shit right now, and to be honest with you- those kids are probably going to be the last good thing their grandpa has in his decline.\n\nALSO- you need to keep your eyes and ears open. Death is not pretty. It is messy, merciless and cold. If you can compromise with your ex and offer whatever support you're willing to give her, she will be able to (hopefully) seek you out for support and make appropriate choices as her father nears the end. \n\nBy that, I mean as her dad declines, the kids will probably spend a lot more time with you. Caring for a dying person is physically and mentally exhausting, and by keeping yourself involved in the situation you can step in and offer to help your ex by taking the children out of adult situations when necessary. \n\nAs grandpa declines, kids should visit but it is not an environment they should be in 24/7. Think of it this way- spend some of \"your time\" sharing your kids with ex and her father now while he is able to enjoy them. Then later, as he declines, you end up getting that time back and keeping the kids more so they don't have to see hospice. Dying is an active process and not pretty to witness. \n\nIn conclusion; NAH. Everything sucks here.

Soon as I could express myself I said \"Grandpa, I love you!\" He got all flustered and gruff and demanded who told me to tell him that, my response was no one, I just did. He was quiet for a long time and then with tears in eyes said he loved me too. My dad has told me that story many times since I was about 2. But I remember there wasn't a day I was at my grandfather's side that he didn't tell me he loved me, and each time my dad cried, because he never said it to his own kids, he showed them but never told them.\n\nGrandpa was a robust, strong man. He was a master mechanic, and brilliant when it came to wood working. Came from a long line of ship builders. He was diagnosed with cancer when I was 6 and was dead in 3 months. He went downhill so fast. He died at his home, stubborn man refused to be in a hospital, and my parents made the decision that I shouldn't see my beloved Grandpa wasting away.

Your ex is probably just scared and doesn't know what to do/expect.", "OP is NTA.  Having worked hospice yearssssss ago, I would imagine the grandfather could use that quiet time to relax.  And OP'S ex can use that time to sit with her father, hold his hand and have some daddy daughter one on one time.  And OP, your kids will need a break from watching someone they love die.  They're too young to understand all this.", "NTA and you made a good point about letting the kids have a break from that environment. \n\nImho tell her you\u2019ll make a concession if it\u2019s on a weekend and he\u2019s actually dying, so they can be there, but her ask is way too big.", "NTA Your kids won't be the ages they are right now again. Sharing all the holidays and special occasions is totally fair, but asking you to give up making your own memories with the kids during this time is deeply unfair. Put down the selfish ask as a manifestation of her grief, but don't give up your time.\n\nAlso, be prepared for the aftermath of his death. She may not be able to take care of the kids properly for a while, but will still need to see them.", "NTA and maybe NAH? I think she is thinking with her feelings.  When my dad died I made all kinds of decisions that revolved around my feelings of desperation about losing him.  After awhile I was able to look back at those times with more clarity and recognize what I was doing/had done.  It's not right of her to ask you to sacrifice so much time with the kids, and the kids probably do need a break from the situation but she probably can't even think about anyone else's perspective right now because she is like grasping at any chance to create more time with him.  I don't think she's doing it maliciously. Losing a parent is not unique in that most people have or will experience it but it is unique in that we can't quite prepare ourselves for how it feels until it happens.  I sympathize for you all.", "NTA the kids well being will be supported by the normal routine as well as getting a break from the hospice environment.", "Absolutely NTA.  Stand your ground.  I've been through this, and your ex doesn't seem to grasp the emotional toll it can have on children.  They need to continue to live their lives and distractions should be welcome.  My guess is that she just wants them to be there when he's passing to say their goodbyes.  You will probably find your ex relying on you more as the time passes.  Remember that bond with your FIL and do what you can to help.", "NTA\n\nBesides the fact he's living with them and they see him all the time, don't set that precedent.  Also, he may enjoy the \"extra quiet\" days when the kids aren't there.", "She\u2019s using your guys kids as a emotional support. Kids needs time away from all that to not have the stress of having to be quiet and calm. Tell her while you understand how devastated she feels, kids need a break from this as well as you spending your slotted 8 days with them.", "And Grandpa may not want them there as he dies. I am a hospice chaplain and have had multiple patients express a strong desire to stay at home until they start to transition and then they want out of the home because they don\u2019t want young grandchildren or sometimes great-grandchildren there as they die. One expressed to me that their only fear of the dying process was that they would pass in the night and be found by a grandchild (the youngest usually came down before their parents). Has OP\u2019s ex even asked her dad what he wants?", "> think there's a good chance your FIL also doesn't necessarily want the kids to see him every day in his increasingly bad state or feel like he has to be 'on' for the kids when he's... dying.\n\nTo add to that... This *could* also last a very long time... Ive know a few people who were told that they won't make it 6 months and they stayed around for a few years!", "I did too, at age 7. I wouldn't say it was traumatising but it wasn't exactly great either. \n\nWatching her wheeze and struggle for breath wasn't exactly a time for creating great memories, y'know? It's not a terrible loss of time with their grandfather to spend a few days a fortnight away from that.", "Yep, when my grandma was dying of cancer it was kept a big secret from the grand children in the family until she was pretty much on the brink of dying. Not a single one of us isn\u2019t pissed about how it was handled now that we\u2019re all adults, and we resent the way our family members hide their health issues to this day.", "They should have the chance to say goodbye, but the last days in hospice are rough. Quite often, the person has already left their body, but the body hasn't caught up. That's not something anyone should be forced to witness. Those of us who have stayed for someone in that situation knew what was happening, and we intentionally made that choice. A little one doesn't understand, and they need a break from living around imminent death. Grown adults do too, which is why you see family taking shifts during hospice time. That gives everyone a break, while still making sure there's someone there with the patient. It's cruel to have a child there the whole time. Obviously, sometimes there's no choice, so you send them out to play with their friends, have a family member take them out, put a movie on in a different room, something besides standing vigil and waiting.", "I'm sorry for your loss - please know that your reaction wasn't bad or wrong. We all process news of a loved one's death differently. There's no right or wrong way to react. You love her, and she knew it. That's all that matters, not your reaction on hearing the news.", "The fact that he\u2019s on hospice with no prognosis is highly suspicious too. They usually won\u2019t offer hospice WITHOUT a time frame of less than 6 months.", "My bad, I thought it said she spoke with her", "NAH", "NTA because they see him 6 days a week.", "Nah. I get why she\u2019s asking but it is very unreasonable. But her emotions must be wild right now. But he lives with her AND the kids. He gets plenty of time with them. If anything he may need a few days of quiet if he truly is that weak. He may love them to death but it doesn\u2019t mean a 5 and 7 year old are easy on the head. And they may need a break too. Watching their grandfather die has to be painful and probably super depressing. They need some time away too", "I\u2019m gunna say NAH, she\u2019s NTA for asking and you\u2019re NTA for saying no. Although I do not think she\u2019s an AH, I am leaning towards your side. Hospice care can be intense and the kids can definitely use the break and their father\u2019s support.\n\nI do wonder\u2026.. I heard on another legal advice Reddit that agreeing to something like this could backfire against you? I\u2019m no expert here but is there potential for that? For example she can say the kids have been spending more time at her place and argue for more official time with them.", "NTA as a cancer patient(and divorced with custody agreement) I find my son needs that time away from all this and decompress. They need time with their dad and have normalcy.", "Watching their grandfather die is going to be hard. The kids may enjoy the time at their dads to unwind and not worry about disturbing their grandfather or mother too.  Being at their dads gives them time to just be kids and not walk on eggshells.  It also gives the grandfather time to not feel he has to hid how he\u2019s doing or gives him time alone with his daughter.  Tte ex may find those days without her kids dats she can fall apart privately and not stress about feeding/entertaining the kids. \n\nIf the grandfather lives with them, the kids are getting plenty of time with him. They need time with their father too.", "Agreed.  The only way OP would be an AH is if the kids asked, on their own accord, to spend a weekend that should be his with their grandfather.", "Yep, she wants him to give up his limited time because her dad is dying. But did OP think about what will happen once her dad does pass? She will demand to keep that extra time because she is grieving her dead dad. It would be cruel of OP to rip her children from her in her time of grief. etc, etc. By the time she is \"well\" again, he may have missed out on 2-3 years of his children's childhood.", "no reading comprehension methinks", "NTA. Stick to your current schedule. If they are up to it, make sure your kids have some fun times when they are with you, or just be there for them if they just need to be with you. Watching their grandfather decline can be very hard and confusing for them. They may need something planned for fun, or they may just need to be with you to make them sure that they aren't losing you also. Take all of your days together and be there for them, no matter what.", "NTA. The kids will need to get away from the situation. It is unfair of your ex to force them to stay there through it all.", "Your ex is being unreasonable\u2026..and this opinion is coming from someone in your ex\u2019s shoes. I have full custody of my son. It sounds like his dad has the same visitations as you. My father was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer in 2016\u2026..and is still very much alive. Hell, he may out live us all \ud83d\ude42. You should definitely try to accommodate some deviation from holiday schedules as a good human, but within reason. You should still be able to see them. Just split up the time. As far as the weekends go. Who the hell wants to hang around  at the ex\u2019s place. That isn\u2019t the quality time you are entitled to. That sounds like supervised visitation. It is absolutely ludicrous that she would propose that. You can be flexible without giving up your right to have and see your children.", "NTA, that\u2019s not a reasonable request on her part."]}
