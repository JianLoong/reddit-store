Kids do not need to spend every day with - forgive the blunt language - a dying man. That'd be pretty rough on them, actually.\n\nI guess it would depend on the person, but I think there's a good chance your FIL also doesn't necessarily want the kids to see him every day in his increasingly bad state or feel like he has to be 'on' for the kids when he's... dying. Surely he'll want rest too?\n\nThey also shouldn't have to wonder why their dad 'doesn't want to take them anymore' because that's how it will feel.\n\nI say NAH because your ex is overwhelmed with the impending loss and she's projecting her desire to have as much time as possible with her dad onto her kids and this request. It's not reasonable, but it's not coming from an AH place either.", "NTA.   I think your kids will need the break much more then they will need the extra time with grandpa. Hospice is stressful at home, much more so then many people realize.   I was an adult when i had to deal with it and I needed breaks, children should absolutely have them.", "NTA. I\u2019d stay flexible. If while he\u2019s still feeling well enough to do things and they want to schedule something, be open to switching up a day for them to do that thing with their grandfather. Other than that, I agree with you that in general the consistency of being with you as the custody order states is pretty important. Maintaining their relationship with you and getting a break from what will be an ongoing stressful environment. As things get worse, keep that open communication. Things may need to shift, watch the kids\u2019 reactions, it may be valuable for your ex and you to consider different days/times to accommodate the children\u2019s needs. She may find out there are days/weekends it would be best for everyone for the kids to stay with you just due to the circumstances. \n\nLots of life changes, feel for everyone involved, but things are going to evolve. Making a drastic and non-flexible decision now will only hurt the kids in the long run.", "NTA specifically because you are correct that it will not be healthy for you kids. They are going to need a safe space to decompress from the grief they are going through watching a beloved family member slowly pass on. \n\nI want to point out that i think your ex has good intentions, but probably fails to realize how much of her attention is going to be focused on her father. Losing time with you will hurt them far more than spending a few extra days with their grandpa will help them. You\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NTA, they have a set routine and you were reasonable in offering to sharing holidays and birthdays. You are right, kids also need time to just be kids despite the tragedy of slowly losing their grandfather and having 1 day a week and every other weekend away is a great break for their mental health.", "NGL OP I was fully expecting to say YTA- but I\u2019m glad I read fully through your post because NTA.\n\nYour Ex is asking for a big ask and I think you\u2019re compromising well with spending holidays together. It\u2019s also a big ask for the kids to spend every weekend with their sick grandpa when they\u2019re so young, and routine is very important especially during a time when emotions are running high. \n\nI would assure your ex that if there is a special occasion or holiday that falls durning your time that you will be more than happy to make accommodations. I would also tell her that if her dad unexpectedly declines quickly and the kids are with you, you will be more than happy to take them to see him. \n\nShe\u2019s hurting right now as it sounds like her dad was an amazing man, and she will be a bit touchy. Losing a parent is so hard at any age and grief is so cruel", "NTA\n\nYou could get hit by a bus tomorrow. No one ever knows how much time they have with their loved ones, but **PARENT** trumps **GRANDPARENT**. If you only get 8 days a month, that\u2019s cheating you out of your time that is *just as precious*, if not more so, because again, YOU ARE THE PARENT. \nSometimes, as a parent you have to be \u201cselfish\u201d and by \u201cselfish\u201d, I mean, not be a People Pleaser and say \u201cI\u2019m important too.\u201d \nThey have considerably MORE days to visit with Grandpa without stealing yours. SHE is being selfish by asking you to give up precious time with your kids that you\u2019ll never get back, when the time you get is so small to begin with. I think it\u2019s enough that you\u2019re willing to share holidays. I know plenty of divorced idiots who refused to co-parent at all, so holidays were always a really difficult time for the kids. \nI don\u2019t understand why your ex feels that she shouldn\u2019t have to give up HER TIME with the kids for HER father, when she gets so much of it.", "NTA The father in law may be dying but it isn\u2019t your responsibility it is good for them to see him before it ends and children aren\u2019t emotional support animals it is good for them to see him but you are still their guardian you even made reasonable offers", "NTA. Children are not emotional support animals. I get why he'd want them around with his father dying (and sympathy to him), but that's not really what is best for the kids. You even offered to share holidays and that's a perfectly reasonable offer.\n\nIf he gets them 5 days a week and you only have weekends his request wasn't reasonable anyway. Not even giving up a single day.", "NAH She's not an AH for asking, but you're also not an AH. Your reasoning of giving them respite from dealing with his illness is valid. However, if you notice that the kids seem especially sad when they're away from him on your days, be open to the possibility that *maybe they would* rather spend as much time with him as possible and adjust your stance on your ex's request. Just remain flexible.", "NTA. I get that your ex wants the kids to know and remember their grandfather, but that doesn\u2019t mean they should sacrifice getting time with their other parent. Especially when you\u2019re offering to change holiday schedules. \n\nPlus, they\u2019re kids. They know what\u2019s going on, but they don\u2019t fully get the grand scheme of it all. If she forces them to stop seeing their other parent and uproot their schedule for the grandfather, chances are they\u2019ll end up resenting both him and the mother. \n\nAs a kid of divorced parents, I remember getting annoyed when schedules shifted around. Stability and consistency is important when you\u2019re at that age \n\nAnd like others have said, the kids aren\u2019t there to be the ex\u2019s emotional support. They deserve to still be kids. Getting time with you away from all the grief is important in and of itself.", "NTA. Those kids will need a break from being around their dying grandfather.  Don't give in.  That's not healthy for them.", "Just my honest AH opinion but you need a new custody agreement right now. \n\nHave you ever dealt with hospice care? This is nothing that young children should be around a majority of the time. If anything, they should be with you during the week and visiting her and grandpa on the weekends. \n\nThat is too much for little kids. Their mental and emotional well being should come first. That isn't in a house with someone dying. That sounds miserable for children. \n\nNo running, playing or making noise because grandpa is sleeping. And what if he passes and one of them are the ones to find him? Hell no. \n\nYour kids absolutely do not need to be there even more than they already are. F that!\n\nNTA but I understand your ex asking because she's thinking about limited time yadda yadda but...not at the expense of the kids emotional and mental wellness.", "NTA \nIt's a difficult situation, of course, but I agree with you. They're with them the whole week and they need a break, too. \nYou could, if you want, ask for your kid's opinion. But at the end, kids need their father and only a few hours every other day it's not enough.", "NTA. agreeing to shared holidays is more than enough.", "NTA, this might be the last time you ever get to see your ex father-in-law.", "NTA. It\u2019s too much to ask. If he had a month left I\u2019d feel differently, but she can\u2019t reasonably ask you to give up 90% of your time for half a year or more.", "NTA. But if you can make an effort to build more time with their grandfather into your time with your kids, I recommend it.", "You are NTA. You have the right to time with your children. It is very kind of you to agree to changing holidays and birthdays. We did hospice for my parent at their house when my children were a little younger than yours. It is hard to see. Your children need the stability of time with you and also brief time away from their house as things get more difficult in my opinion. The Invisible Thread was a great book we read together during this time.\n\nI am sorry your ex-fil is suffering. Your ex-wife might just be trying to find control anywhere she can right now.", "NTA, it was OK for her to ask but not her reaction. Children thrive with a regular routine, you would be doing them a disservice to change things since you have no idea how long grandpa has. \nYou are correct in thinking they need a break as well, although they love grandpa this will be a very difficult time for them and they can decompress at your house.", "NTA\u2026 he could live years, you never know & you can\u2019t be expected to lose that time with your children. Further, it\u2019s probably a nice break from a potentially stressful, somber household to spend time at your home.", "[deleted]", "ESH. The ex maybe over reached, but you are totally TA. Learn to communicate and adapt instead of looking at it as legal gamemmanship that can be \"won\". Your kids are going to turn out like shit and hate one, or both, of you if you refuse to be at least a little dynamic with their relationships with family.\n\n\nShame in you.", "So your FIL is dying and your first instinct is to put yourself first rather than him? You cannot change your schedule? \n\nCongrats on being an AH. Karma is real, you'll find yourself in the future being stuck in a hospital bed with no family to give a shit.... when or if that happens, just remember how you didn't care about your FILnor did you put anyone first before your selfish feelings.

Hope you all get through this ok, stick to your guns and try to be empathetic as possible. Maybe tell her that it's good for kids to keep routines when other things in their lives are changing.

Her expecting you to give her custody 85% of the time, for an indeterminate duration, when she already has it 70% of the time, is totally unreasonable. Your point about the kids needing some respite from exposure to palliative care is also a good one.

The kids\u2019 relationship with you is important and you need to be able to have that relationship outside of her home.", "NTA. They are spending the majority of their time with him as it is.

It gives them some sort of normal and structure in an time that is very uncertain. \n\nAnd I also think both grandpa and the mother will need an break from the kids from time to time. It\u2019s going to be an hard time, it\u2019s going to be painful and stressful. For them as well it would be better when there are periods of time that the children are not around.
