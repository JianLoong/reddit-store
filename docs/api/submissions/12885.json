Kids do not need to spend every day with - forgive the blunt language - a dying man. That'd be pretty rough on them, actually.\n\nI guess it would depend on the person, but I think there's a good chance your FIL also doesn't necessarily want the kids to see him every day in his increasingly bad state or feel like he has to be 'on' for the kids when he's... dying. Surely he'll want rest too?\n\nThey also shouldn't have to wonder why their dad 'doesn't want to take them anymore' because that's how it will feel.\n\nI say NAH because your ex is overwhelmed with the impending loss and she's projecting her desire to have as much time as possible with her dad onto her kids and this request. It's not reasonable, but it's not coming from an AH place either.", "NTA.   I think your kids will need the break much more then they will need the extra time with grandpa. Hospice is stressful at home, much more so then many people realize.   I was an adult when i had to deal with it and I needed breaks, children should absolutely have them.", "NTA. I\u2019d stay flexible. If while he\u2019s still feeling well enough to do things and they want to schedule something, be open to switching up a day for them to do that thing with their grandfather. Other than that, I agree with you that in general the consistency of being with you as the custody order states is pretty important. Maintaining their relationship with you and getting a break from what will be an ongoing stressful environment. As things get worse, keep that open communication. Things may need to shift, watch the kids\u2019 reactions, it may be valuable for your ex and you to consider different days/times to accommodate the children\u2019s needs. She may find out there are days/weekends it would be best for everyone for the kids to stay with you just due to the circumstances. \n\nLots of life changes, feel for everyone involved, but things are going to evolve. Making a drastic and non-flexible decision now will only hurt the kids in the long run.", "NTA specifically because you are correct that it will not be healthy for you kids. They are going to need a safe space to decompress from the grief they are going through watching a beloved family member slowly pass on. \n\nI want to point out that i think your ex has good intentions, but probably fails to realize how much of her attention is going to be focused on her father. Losing time with you will hurt them far more than spending a few extra days with their grandpa will help them. You\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NTA, they have a set routine and you were reasonable in offering to sharing holidays and birthdays. You are right, kids also need time to just be kids despite the tragedy of slowly losing their grandfather and having 1 day a week and every other weekend away is a great break for their mental health.", "NGL OP I was fully expecting to say YTA- but I\u2019m glad I read fully through your post because NTA.\n\nYour Ex is asking for a big ask and I think you\u2019re compromising well with spending holidays together. It\u2019s also a big ask for the kids to spend every weekend with their sick grandpa when they\u2019re so young, and routine is very important especially during a time when emotions are running high. \n\nI would assure your ex that if there is a special occasion or holiday that falls durning your time that you will be more than happy to make accommodations. I would also tell her that if her dad unexpectedly declines quickly and the kids are with you, you will be more than happy to take them to see him. \n\nShe\u2019s hurting right now as it sounds like her dad was an amazing man, and she will be a bit touchy. Losing a parent is so hard at any age and grief is so cruel", "NTA\n\nYou could get hit by a bus tomorrow. No one ever knows how much time they have with their loved ones, but **PARENT** trumps **GRANDPARENT**. If you only get 8 days a month, that\u2019s cheating you out of your time that is *just as precious*, if not more so, because again, YOU ARE THE PARENT. \nSometimes, as a parent you have to be \u201cselfish\u201d and by \u201cselfish\u201d, I mean, not be a People Pleaser and say \u201cI\u2019m important too.\u201d \nThey have considerably MORE days to visit with Grandpa without stealing yours. SHE is being selfish by asking you to give up precious time with your kids that you\u2019ll never get back, when the time you get is so small to begin with. I think it\u2019s enough that you\u2019re willing to share holidays. I know plenty of divorced idiots who refused to co-parent at all, so holidays were always a really difficult time for the kids. \nI don\u2019t understand why your ex feels that she shouldn\u2019t have to give up HER TIME with the kids for HER father, when she gets so much of it.", "NTA The father in law may be dying but it isn\u2019t your responsibility it is good for them to see him before it ends and children aren\u2019t emotional support animals it is good for them to see him but you are still their guardian you even made reasonable offers", "NTA. Children are not emotional support animals. I get why he'd want them around with his father dying (and sympathy to him), but that's not really what is best for the kids. You even offered to share holidays and that's a perfectly reasonable offer.\n\nIf he gets them 5 days a week and you only have weekends his request wasn't reasonable anyway. Not even giving up a single day.", "NAH She's not an AH for asking, but you're also not an AH. Your reasoning of giving them respite from dealing with his illness is valid. However, if you notice that the kids seem especially sad when they're away from him on your days, be open to the possibility that *maybe they would* rather spend as much time with him as possible and adjust your stance on your ex's request. Just remain flexible.", "NTA. I get that your ex wants the kids to know and remember their grandfather, but that doesn\u2019t mean they should sacrifice getting time with their other parent. Especially when you\u2019re offering to change holiday schedules. \n\nPlus, they\u2019re kids. They know what\u2019s going on, but they don\u2019t fully get the grand scheme of it all. If she forces them to stop seeing their other parent and uproot their schedule for the grandfather, chances are they\u2019ll end up resenting both him and the mother. \n\nAs a kid of divorced parents, I remember getting annoyed when schedules shifted around. Stability and consistency is important when you\u2019re at that age \n\nAnd like others have said, the kids aren\u2019t there to be the ex\u2019s emotional support. They deserve to still be kids. Getting time with you away from all the grief is important in and of itself.", "NTA. Those kids will need a break from being around their dying grandfather.  Don't give in.  That's not healthy for them.", "Just my honest AH opinion but you need a new custody agreement right now. \n\nHave you ever dealt with hospice care? This is nothing that young children should be around a majority of the time. If anything, they should be with you during the week and visiting her and grandpa on the weekends. \n\nThat is too much for little kids. Their mental and emotional well being should come first. That isn't in a house with someone dying. That sounds miserable for children. \n\nNo running, playing or making noise because grandpa is sleeping. And what if he passes and one of them are the ones to find him? Hell no. \n\nYour kids absolutely do not need to be there even more than they already are. F that!\n\nNTA but I understand your ex asking because she's thinking about limited time yadda yadda but...not at the expense of the kids emotional and mental wellness.", "NTA \nIt's a difficult situation, of course, but I agree with you. They're with them the whole week and they need a break, too. \nYou could, if you want, ask for your kid's opinion. But at the end, kids need their father and only a few hours every other day it's not enough.", "NTA. agreeing to shared holidays is more than enough.", "NTA, this might be the last time you ever get to see your ex father-in-law.", "NTA. It\u2019s too much to ask. If he had a month left I\u2019d feel differently, but she can\u2019t reasonably ask you to give up 90% of your time for half a year or more.", "NTA. But if you can make an effort to build more time with their grandfather into your time with your kids, I recommend it.", "You are NTA. You have the right to time with your children. It is very kind of you to agree to changing holidays and birthdays. We did hospice for my parent at their house when my children were a little younger than yours. It is hard to see. Your children need the stability of time with you and also brief time away from their house as things get more difficult in my opinion. The Invisible Thread was a great book we read together during this time.\n\nI am sorry your ex-fil is suffering. Your ex-wife might just be trying to find control anywhere she can right now.", "NTA, it was OK for her to ask but not her reaction. Children thrive with a regular routine, you would be doing them a disservice to change things since you have no idea how long grandpa has. \nYou are correct in thinking they need a break as well, although they love grandpa this will be a very difficult time for them and they can decompress at your house.", "NTA\u2026 he could live years, you never know & you can\u2019t be expected to lose that time with your children. Further, it\u2019s probably a nice break from a potentially stressful, somber household to spend time at your home.", "[deleted]", "ESH. The ex maybe over reached, but you are totally TA. Learn to communicate and adapt instead of looking at it as legal gamemmanship that can be \"won\". Your kids are going to turn out like shit and hate one, or both, of you if you refuse to be at least a little dynamic with their relationships with family.\n\n\nShame in you.", "So your FIL is dying and your first instinct is to put yourself first rather than him? You cannot change your schedule? \n\nCongrats on being an AH. Karma is real, you'll find yourself in the future being stuck in a hospital bed with no family to give a shit.... when or if that happens, just remember how you didn't care about your FILnor did you put anyone first before your selfish feelings.

Hope you all get through this ok, stick to your guns and try to be empathetic as possible. Maybe tell her that it's good for kids to keep routines when other things in their lives are changing.

Her expecting you to give her custody 85% of the time, for an indeterminate duration, when she already has it 70% of the time, is totally unreasonable. Your point about the kids needing some respite from exposure to palliative care is also a good one.

It gives them some sort of normal and structure in an time that is very uncertain. \n\nAnd I also think both grandpa and the mother will need an break from the kids from time to time. It\u2019s going to be an hard time, it\u2019s going to be painful and stressful. For them as well it would be better when there are periods of time that the children are not around.

Because he hasn\u2019t passed yet, there\u2019s also a kind of mania to make every second of time remaining left with him COUNT. Encourage your ex-wife to plan special things with her father on those days, just the two of them or maybe their own nuclear family. If he isn\u2019t mobile, could be as simple as a board game or even just going through old pictures, or maybe journaling about his life, especially his life before her. Are you obligated to do anything of the sort? No, but what a wonderful lesson for your children to see their father be kind to their mother during such a difficult time. They may not fully understand now, but they will later. \n\nI hope that you also take some time alone with your FIL. I know he\u2019s technically your ex-FIL, but you seem to think very highly of him, and he was a very important relationship in your life, at least once upon a time. Your marriage may have soured, but don\u2019t let that stop you from that closure, both for you and for him. \n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong here. But I also don\u2019t think your ex-wife is thinking clearly right now, and certainly she isn\u2019t acting maliciously. \n\nBest of luck. I wish you all peace and kindness during the coming months.\n\nETA: maybe you could gift your ex-wife a legacy journal similar to this, and encourage her to use those private days when the kids are with you, filling it out with her father? And then the important memories and details that she may not know or remember or think to ask, will live on. Much more precious to your children in the long run than a few extra days per month of seeing their grandfather deteriorate. Again, are you obligated? No. Would it be kind (and maybe help smooth things over)? Yes. \n\nhttps://www.duncanandstone.com/products/legacy-journal-charcoal", "NAH. If the kids express that they want more time at home with their grandad, let them. Otherwise stick to the current arrangement", "NTA.\n\nAll I\u2019m hearing from your ex is what she thinks is best for your children. Do your children even want to be there? I would have hated to have been present for my grandparent\u2019s hospice care. Dying is not always dignified and your children should be shielded as much as possible. 7 and 5 is old enough for them to contribute towards these decisions. At least you seem to have their best interests at heart. I understand mother is grieving but she is not making good decisions for her children.", "NAH. I think your reasoning makes a lot of sense. You may want to sit down separately with your kids to talk about what's going on and see what they want. They should have some say, though maybe not the final decision. \n\nFor everyone's sake, see if there's anything else you can do to make things easier for your ex-wife and kids. Compromising a little will pay off in terms of your relationship with your ex and kids down the road.", "NTA you\u2019re right. The kids need a break from dealing with grandpas cancer", "NAH - I understand her ask, but you're also right to say no. You've acquiesced on the holiday issue, you should be keeping your weekends. They already live with a very sick man in the house- they deserve a break! They deserve space to let loose, to talk about uncomfortable feelings, and to not worry about their grandfather, or their mother's feelings. You're doing the right thing, and your wife may come around, but be prepared to hash this out repeatedly.", "NTA. \n\nFrom just a \"think of the children\" perspective, five and seven is very young to watch a person die of cancer. That shit was terrifying as an adult I can't imagine being a kid. Your kids don't need to have that shoved in their face 24/7 and will definitely need respite from it. Their time with you is perfect for that. This is a conversation you (and just you at first) need to have with them.\n\nAside from that, you should not have to surrender your time, especially so early. Maybe close to the date would be understandable. But, if you consider it at all, say you expect the time to be compensated after (you get the same amount of extra days and holidays with the kids)\n\nEither way, shower those kids with love!", "As someone who was in a situation like this all i can say is. Talk to your kids for f\\*\\*\\*\\* sake man.   \n\n\nWhen my grandmother died my father tried everything to get more time and basically pushed to have me and my brother whenever he was entitled to it.

He was at home until he was hospitalized and passed a week later. The viewing the day before the funeral was very long. Of course as a child and being around the casket and so many people with sadness and crying, I was highly emotional. I cried and felt awful during those hours. I also had two sister, 11 and 7. \n\nA family friend, with my mom\u2019s permission, took us for a break to the convenient store that was within walking distance. She let us pick out snacks and drinks. We hung out outside with our food and were able to just be kids. We definitely needed a break from all that.  \n\nI write this to help you understand that while I loved my father its not healthy or easy for kids to be around grief 24/7. They need to get a break from it all. Having weekends away will help them with the process of losing their grandfather.", "Lets go NAH. Your ex is grieving but she's not asking for something reasonable here. There is a deal to be made to accommodate her now in exchange for making up the weekends and holidays in the fall after her father has passed.", "NAH.  I can objectively view both points of view.  OP doesn't want to limit his visitations to two times a month.  Ex is losing her father; she wants her children to spend as much time as possible with the granddad, but the children need consistency in their lives right now.  \n\nDepriving them of visitation with dad, during this period, could have negative consequences.  The granddad is in Hospice right now, that is not an environment the children (5 & 7) need to be subjected to 24/7 until he passes.  Let them be children.  \n\nWhen my dad was in Hospice in 20/20.  He loved seeing his adult grandchildren and yes, the younger ones brought a smile to his face, but as he got closer to his passing, it made the younger ones very sad and a little depressed, probably because we were sad and depressed.  If anything, let them spend a little more time away from that environment.  She's focusing on her own loss, which is difficult to face at this time. As he starts fading away, he won't even be aware the children are there.", "Nta- My grandmother lived with my family when she\u2019s was going through cancer treatment, she got better. Then it came back a year later, but widespread. I watched cancer destroy her, till she was a withered thing of herself. Just stuck in bed. I was around 13 at the time, let me tell you I would not wish for someone young to deal with that. My parents didn\u2019t let me or my brother in the room, when she was actively dying. Still it changed me.", "NTA she has plenty of time with them already.", "NTA. She already has the kids majority of the time, asking for more is unreasonable", "NTA. You're their parent. You have every reason to spend as much time with them as your custody agreement allows, especially during a stressful time like this. They need to maintain a relationship with you and know without a doubt that you love them and want to spend time with them.\n\nI think it's both kind and generous of you to be willing to bring the kids to her place to visit during days when they are with you. Since she thought you visiting them at her place instead of them staying with you would suffice for you to have time with them, she has no plausible argument for why them visiting her place wouldn't suffice for their grandfather.\n\nYour ex might not an AH for asking, but she is definitely an AH for not taking no for an answer.\n\nThe reason I said \"might\" is because although her request could have been motivated solely by a desire to maximize the time her and the kids have with her dad, she could also be trying to leverage the situation to weaken your relationships with your kids. If I were you, I would find it hard to believe that she has no ulterior motives.", "NAH if I were to see my kid so little I wouldn't give up on that either, is there a way you could completely switch custody schedules? so  she gets them the 1 day per week and 2 times a month and compromise on holidays? 50/50?", "Soft NTA, I don't think you're at all the AH but I do have some empathy for ex's point of view. It's an unreasonable request and she's projecting her want to spend as much time with her dad onto her kids. My kids are the same age (a little older actually, 6 and 8) and they would need breaks. When you're taking them be sure to do things that they want to do and make sure they're able to blow off steam if they need to. Their living situation right now is probably tense and sad and confusing for them. Having you continue to take them when you do is really healthy for them.", "ESH- I wonder why your ex cannot see that YOU are also a father and want to cherish the time you have with your kids, life is complicated and no one knows how long theirs will last. I understand she is grieving and probably not thinking as clearly as she may normally think.... But at the same time, I'm curious why there could not be a compromise of some sort to give her a little more time than usual? I don't think that would be asking much from her.", "NAH - maybe consider including grandfather in some weekend plans (on your weekends) while he is not bedridden and create core memories if you can.", "NTA.", "NTA - your ex needs to abide by the terms of the custody agreement.", "NTA my son has the same schedule as you and he really values his time with his child, and vice versa. \n\nThe children are seeing a lot of their GF. I don't think anyone's being deprived.", "NTA.  What she is asking is unreasonable when it appears that your ex FIL will live 6 more months.

I would suggest talking to them and letting them tell you how they feel so that they can express whatever feelings they have.

Good luck and my condolences for the loss of your ex FIL", "No one is an a-hole here.  But, what do the children want?", "INFO: 7 and 5 are young but not too young to be unaware.

Rough, I know, but the 2 of you must have a plan in place for the kids.", "I understand that time is fleeting and your ex wants her kids to get as much time w their grandfather as possible before his passing. It makes sense, and her heart is in the right place. I can understand her request to temporarily have you join holidays w her family during this time (which you also say is fair and workable), and that's fine. The fact that you're willing to do that much already marks you NTA.\n\nNow, here's where I'm going to ruffle a feather or two.\n\nAsking you to have holidays over there is entirely understandable. Asking you to give up your one day a week, however, is selfish and rude. There's a point where she's grieving and asking for some leeway, and then there's a point where she's just taking advantage of the situation. And she's crossing into the latter.\n\nIf any of this is in text form, save that shit. Because if she tries to use this later in court, you have proof that she was trying to minimize your visitation/custody arrangement.", "NTA- they are there for the majority of the time. Her request is odd and her reaction is even weirder. It's almost as if she is projecting her grief onto you and the custody agreement. There is no reason why the children should be tethered to a dying man 4/7 and denied the right to see their father. I think she is trying to use this to manipulate the situation. After a few months ahe would be able to tell the judge you voluntarily gave up your visitation and thus she should get more money and you should have less rights. Who knows what is going through her mind. Maybe she is just wanting to inconvenience you somehow because she feels like you were supposed to be with her when this happened and it isn't fair that you get to be free of any type of inconvenience when she is experiencing so much heartbreak. Idk... but something is very off here and you should not listen to her.", "You're the asshole.  You said the father is an amazing man, and you really bonded with him.  One would think you'd want to spend time with him as well.  (If he's in hospice, I'd be surprised if he makes it *to* summer, never mind past it.)  Your ex isn't saying you can't see the kids, just spend your time with your kids at her house.  It's only for a few months, and compared to a lifetime, that's nothing.  What's strange to me is that you're so concerned about not seeing your kids (even though you will be able to), but apparently not so concerned about them that you (and your ex) put them through a divorce in the first place.", "Hi! I\u2019d like to give perspective. \n\nFor rule purposes, YTA. \n\nMy dad was dying of cancer. My son whom I co parent for, was his best friend and Vice versa.

My son, even desperately begged. He said no. \n\nI filed an emergency motion for a temporary change. 3 judges said he was 100% a crap parent for refusing, but they didn\u2019t have any legal standing to change it without making our co parenting journey more resentful and full of anger. \n\n\nGuess what happened? My son came home on the 6th late at night after the summer with his dad, his dad refused to change and a few hours later my dad died. \n\nI will literally NEVER forgive my co parent. \nMy son said he will NEVER forgive his dad for being so selfish. \n\n$15,000 later\u2026. in family therapy, co parenting therapy, therapy for my son, lawyers, etc - we finally can be slightly friends again - 3 years later. \n\nMy son, whom is a pre teen - hasn\u2019t decided if he\u2019ll go fully NC on his dad when he\u2019s 18 simply because he can\u2019t believe how selfish he was. I think they\u2019ll get through it, but it\u2019s not a guarantee.\n\n\nETA: I was willing to pay for my ex to come stay here - I offered flight, hotel, compensation, wage replacement\u2026 I offered giving him an entire Thanksgiving break he wouldn\u2019t normally get to compensate for time missed, etc.", "You know if you give that time up that custody time you legally were awarded, she could argue for full custody and use that as example/leverage?

And please share this with her u/aslan245 : I come from a very large, generationally spread family. I started dealing with long term, terminal illnesses in loved ones before kindergarten. There never wasn't someone dying my entire childhood and adolescence, and I can tell you right now, dealing with that with no real respites required a lot of therapy when I reached adulthood. Keeping your custody days right now is in the best interests of your children, so they can have respite. \n\nI agree with the comment that your ex is projecting. But, having every possible moment is also not healthy for her either. Your ex needs breaks as well", "Heck, i'm a whole adult and my mom told me after the last time she and my dad went to go see my grandfather when he was dying a few years ago that she was glad i didn't go with them.", "I was 20 when my father died. I still can't bear to look at photographs of him from the months before he passed. My older brother was unavoidably overseas at the time. Over 30 years later, I still feel he was lucky not to see Dad like that. If I found it hard to see my ill father at age 20, I can't imagine how much harder it would be for younger children.", "Hearing this makes me feel bad. My grandmother died maybe when I was 13 years old and when I heard the news I felt nothing despite the fact I love her more than anyone in the world even my mother", "Agree. The holidays I could understand as it'll be the last opportunity for then to have this moment with their grandfather. But asking OP to give up his already limited custodial time for months was an AH ask, grief or not.", "Honestly, yes. At least temporarily. I am jaded and probably projecting a bit, but I personally lean towards her gunning for sole custody by asking this of him - her dad is just a convenient excuse.\n\nThere is NO WAY someone living in a hospice house wants two little kids running around making a ton of noise and being, well, kids. It's an emotionally tense and stressful time. The kids should be allowed to relieve their own anxiety and fears about death and how scary things are with Grandpa. They can't do that, if they're *never allowed to leave*. \n\nI just can't see any of this coming from her in any capacity except to gun for more custody. \n\nIANAL, but now is the time for OP to do what is best for the kids, which is for them to NOT be in a terrifying, constraining environment. Mom and grandma should still see the kids, but maybe on a swapped schedule or 50/50 schedule, instead.", "I last talked to my grandpa before he had his leg amputated and it was a great conversation. He went downhill so fast after the surgery that my mom called and said to not call him to check on him - he wouldn't have known who I was and she didn't want me to experience that heartbreak because we were so close.

Reality comes in many shades of gray.", "Because she\u2019s not acting maliciously, she\u2019s just sad and grasping at straws.

I still believe that asking OP for his custody time going forward for several months, without offering anything up in return, makes her an asshole, regardless of the lack of malicious intent or the fact that she's grieving.", "Not sure if you meant to reply to me or the other person, but yeah, agreed. Malicious intent is not a requirement for asshole behavior.", "I agree, people can be arses without malicious intent. However, the thing you have to try and remember here is her dad is dying. She's probably heavily grieving and wants some semblance of control. OP is well within his rights to say no but she hasn't demanded it, she's just asked. \n\nYes it is a pretty unreasonable request but she's worried about losing time between her kids and their grandfather. Grief makes people do funny things and I would always try and give them the benefit of the doubt.", "Haha you are right I meant to reply to other person.", "So the kids live with the grandpa and he wants to take away what little time they have left with their grandpa, who must be a big part of their life, at his ex\u2019s and kids most vulnerable time? \nIf he wants to split custody there are better times to do it in the future.\nthis smells like he\u2019s just paying her back and trying to hurt her by claiming concerns for the kids and his legal rights.
