All our kids get along well, and we have a good relationship with each other\u2019s children.\n\nMy parents are very doting grandparents to my 3 bio kids but have always been standoffish with my stepsons. There has been lots of little things over the years that have shown how little they care for them. They have never once bought them a birthday present (my wife's parents get my daughter's gifts) and at Christmas they are always given the most pathetic/cheap gift. It's not always bad as there has been times when, my dad in particular, has been good at engaging with them. In November he came with me and the boys to watch a football game and go out for lunch and everybody had a great time.\n\nLast week my mom stayed with us as it was my daughter's 10th birthday. She stayed in the 17 year olds room and he slept on an air mattress in his brother's room. Not only did she never think to thank him, but she also tried banning him from going in the room at all when he occasionally needed to. One morning he knocked on the door to ask if he could go in to grab his sneakers and she said no and wouldn't even pass them to him. I had to intervene and get them myself. Despite this he was nothing but polite to her face. If I listed every passive aggressive thing she said/did to the boys during her stay it would make this post to long.\n\nOn Friday, the 13 yo and toddler were playing outside with a basketball. At one point 13 yo threw the ball a little too hard at his brother and knocked him over. My mom had been outside and saw what happened and started to berate the 13 yo and grabbing him hard by the arm. When his mom came outside to see why the baby was crying my mom continued to say foul things about my stepson and called him an awful brother and dangerous to her grandson. When stepson told his mom what he had accidentally done, my mom started raving about him doing it on purpose.\n\nWhen I got home my stepson was sulking in his room. My wife had told me what had happened, so I went to see him, and we talked. He vented about how my mom had made him feel the whole week and asked me why she hated him and his brother. This made me angry and after talking with my wife, I decided to ask my mom to leave and told her she wouldn\u2019t be welcome back until she corrected her attitude towards my stepsons. Of course, she didn\u2019t take this well and after she argued with me for over an hour she left. Later I got a call from my dad who was livid, he wouldn\u2019t let me explain myself, so I hang up.\n\nI feel I did the right thing to protect my stepsons, but my siblings are also upset with me. They think I\u2019m an ass for treating our mom badly and overreacting. Even my wife thinks we shouldn\u2019t have kicked her out but instead talked to her and given her a chance to change her behaviour.

I got an uncle Ben, and he has a cousin named Ben. Some names are really good I guess.", "She grabbed him. She has no right to touch him or discipline him. \n\nYou did the right thing. There is no reason  a child shouldn't be comfortable in their own home. \n\nShame on her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. A good parent protects their family, which you are doing. No one should treat children poorly or differently from other kids in the home.", "NTA. And your wife is weak. Her sons will see that she didn't have their back and they'll always remember it.", "NTA, not a drop. They've been treating them so visibly less than for some time, what she did to the 13 year old should have been absolutely the last straw.", "NTA, good job.", "NTA. You did absolutely the right thing. It sounds like your mother was borderline abusive towards your stepkids and that is not okay. I have noticed a pattern where people who are abusive and their enablers say that someone is \"overreacting\" when you are just setting boundaries and protecting your family. \n\nThanks for being an awesome stepdad! The world needs more like you.", "NTA, your mom was way out of line!", "What your mom did was abusive.  You were absolutely right to throw her out, and I'm proud of you for being such a good stepdad.

Not the \u201csorry you felt that way\u201d kind of thing. \n\nEven then, I probably wouldn\u2019t allow her back to stay.

She needs to apologize *sincerely* to the boys.", "When she wouldn\u2019t let him get his sneakers I\u2019d have at least kicked her out of his room - out of the house would\u2019ve been better.

She is a guest in somebody else's room and she can't even be decent enough to allow them to get their belongings? She is openly saying \"you're not even worth being decent to.\" NTA.

The fact of the matter is that those boys ARE your children now, and she's treating them like garbage because of some bullshit ideas about blood.\n\nI guarantee your wife is only saying that you should have talked to your mother again because she's worried about being blamed by your family for the situation, or her boys being further outcast. Reassure her that you will do what it takes to protect and support her and your boys from your toxic family.", "NTA Go you, you are awesome", "NTA.

I have a \u201cstep\u201d daughter who\u2019s only 9months younger than me & she\u2019s treated like she\u2019s my sister in a way from my parents cause the grand daughter part is odd feeling given the close age. But her kids & her step son so great grandkids to my parents have been welcomed with open arms. My dad was even at the hospital for the youngest\u2019s birth. Blood doesn\u2019t mean family. They are all your children no matter what & should be treated equally by all!!!", "NTA.\nThere is NOTHING Worse than an adult making kids feel unloved. Except when no one calls it out. \nHow would your mom feel if your Bio-children were treated this way by your ex-wifes new husband's family? \nThe fact that she thinks it's okay to treat kids like this says a lot about her. \nGood for YOU!!!", "NTA.

Don't give people chances that they won't use and will only exploit you further.", "NTA", "NTA, those are your children and she\u2019s treating them like shit.

Kids remember things like this, and hold onto it, whether for good or bad.", "NTA. \nIt's not the first time that she has done something like this and so she has had multiple chances to correct the behaviour.

You handled it fantastically.\nIt's clear though,\n no matter how you talk to her about it.\nYour mom clearly won't change.\nThe fact she feels she has the right to even rough handle them is disgusting,\n I don't see that mentality changing", "Not just apologize, but also prove to both you and your stepsons that her behavior has permanently changed. She needs to do a lot of work from a distance to rebuild trust with them, or every interaction with her will strain their relationship with you and their mom if they feel pressured to accept her back while they still feel unsafe and attacked \n\nNTA and I'm really glad you stood up for your kids.", "Agreed. And write your Dad and siblings a comprehensive list of the things your mom has done, until her assault and unwarranted accusation against you stepson brought things to a boiling point.", "I would also make sure the rest of the family knows the real story of what happened and how she's been treating them. If they still side with her, I'd say it's time for a period of NC.", "I mean, most married couples have family that isn't biological: their partner.", "NTA. I think it's time to change your relationship with your mother for quite a while by distancing yourself until you think she gets the point that you are very serious about her behavior toward your stepsons. When you feel like she can behave properly, you should talk to her about what is and is not acceptable behavior and you must continue to stand up for your stepchildren. Great job.", "You DO have the right to protect your stepsons. They\u2019re kids, your parents should behave like kind grandparents, not Cinderella\u2019s stepmother. You did the right thing. \n\nShe might have been worried about the toddler, but after a week of being mean to your step kids, maybe her motives were not so pure.", "1. Do you really believe that she would actually change her behaviour just by talking with her?\n\n2. Do you believe that your mother told your father and sisters the truth about what happened?\n\nPeople like your mother tend to be... resistant to changing how they behave, because they are certain that they are in the right... and that, in this case, you are the one being unfair and unreasonable. They also have very... selective filters in how they see and report confrontations , especially when they are sure that they are right. Which is always... not that they are right, but that they feel they are.\n\nI wish you the best of luck. You are right, you are NTA... but you are in for a long and unpleasant conflict with your mother, and probably your sister and father too.", "NTA  You deserve dad and step-dad of the year award! I'm surprised that your wife would want someone in the house that would emotionally abuse any of the children. That part is sad.", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for your stepkids. They shouldn't  be treated like that in their own home.", "NTA  \nI know I'll get some hate for this...But I feel like YTA for letting them suffer this abuse for this long. How do you have a list sooooo long about the awful things she's done to them, but have not done a thing to actually protect them? Both you and your wife.   \n\n\nAnd now it could be that your whole family will start to mistreat them too, sounds like they've already started tbh...you're going on about how much you love your stepsons but how did it even get to this, that you have to get them their shoes from their own room for a whole week because they're not allowed in their own room? Getting shit presents or no presents at all. and then they know their grandparents treat their step/half sibling well but they're being treated like shit from their half/step siblings grands/aunts/etc? You love them, but why is this happening to them then? I'm genuinely confused.", "NTA. You\u2019re a top step-dad and your stepsons are lucky to have you. \nYou\u2019re a good role model to them.", "NTA and good for you. My parents repeatedly do small things that highlight that they don't think of their step-grandchildren (my sibling's step kids) as equal to their grandchildren. I have to call them on it often. Mainly pointing out that *I* am a step kid and how insulting it would be to me if my step-grandparents treated me like that. They seem surprised at that logic every damn time.", "NTA  \nYour kids are very lucky to have a stepdad like you. I would do the same if that happened to me.  \n\n\nIf it was the first time that she was treating your stepsons like this then kicking her out would be too much. But since she always had those problems and it makes the boys upset, you handled it fine.", "NTA. But I would recommend talking to your siblings about what actually happened. It seems like they (and your dad) have gotten a different storyline. Maybe if they actually understand, they might be useful in making your mom realize the error of her ways.", "NTA!! It is so blatantly clear that she holds some form of dislike/resentment toward them. Talking to her about her behavior may have been an option BEFORE she started harassing your stepson.", "NTA. Your mom owes and apology to every single individual in the household, detailing every single reason why she\u2019s apologizing. She can even apologize to the 2 year old for treating their siblings in a horrible manner!", "Yes you did the right thing! I applaud you!", "She was intentionally harming a child physically & emotionally, while lying about them. You did right thing. Make clear to dad & siblings they all will be NC with you all if they don't see her abuse for what it is & apologize. Don't give your mom another chance to harm those kids, bc she will.", "NTA. You are an amazing step-parent! You have demonstrated to them how to behave well: Have your kids backs (even non-bio ones), discuss issues with your spouse and be a team, listen to your children and take them seriously, hold people accountable for their behavior no matter how they are related to you. Stick to your guns OP, this behavior isn't going to change with just a conversation with her and kicking her out gives tangible consequences to her behavior. Respond to all the criticism with the same statement over and over and just repeat yourself until they get it: Your mother behaved poorly as a guest and consistently made your step-sons feel bad about themselves, unloved and unwanted by their step-grandparents and less than your other children. \n\nI wish you luck!", "NTA", "NTA but only just.\n\nThis should have been nipped in the bud long ago.\n\nYou're now at scorched earth, where a few years ago you probably could have had a conversation with Mum first.", "I don\u2019t have enough wheels on my house to fully appreciate this post.", "NTA. She had at least few years to change her behavior. Good for you for standing up to your kids.", "I\u2019m not sure how long you\u2019ve been married but it was way past due you put a stop to this awful treatment your stepsons have been exposed to by tour parents. \n\nAnyone who disagrees can join being banned as well. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all. You know that. Your mother is horrible. You know that too.", "NTA She isn\u2019t even neutral to the the boys. She\u2019s actively mistreating them. She\u2019s refusing to do things for them that she would (probably) do for a random stranger, like passing out the shoes. She acts like she sees them as threats and interlopers. She should not be welcomed back until she can treat them with common decency and respect at the very least", "The part I don't like is the wife sort of siding with the grandmother who is harassing her blood children. For me, such treatment would get the Mama bear out of me, not trying to keep peace with my children's abuser", "Which is honestly a pretty big thing. I would say OP is to blame for allowing this to continue so long. He should have made it clear a LOT sooner that his parents needed to treat his step-children equally. Why did you let this slide so long, OP?", "Exactly\u2026 mum can go stay with them \n\nI\u2019d be replying - \u201cif you think as a parent I would let anyone continue being nasty to children, my stepsons, in their own home, then you are part of the problem too. We are all upset by mothers behaviour. She owes X and Y a huge apology\u201d\n\nNTA", "Hell to the fucking this. I don't care who you are, don't you put your hands in anger on a child. Kids roughhouse and play and sometimes they accidentally get hurt. It sounds like the little one was fine. Absolutely no reason for such a reaction."]}
