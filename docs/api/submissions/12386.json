All our kids get along well, and we have a good relationship with each other\u2019s children.\n\nMy parents are very doting grandparents to my 3 bio kids but have always been standoffish with my stepsons. There has been lots of little things over the years that have shown how little they care for them. They have never once bought them a birthday present (my wife's parents get my daughter's gifts) and at Christmas they are always given the most pathetic/cheap gift. It's not always bad as there has been times when, my dad in particular, has been good at engaging with them. In November he came with me and the boys to watch a football game and go out for lunch and everybody had a great time.\n\nLast week my mom stayed with us as it was my daughter's 10th birthday. She stayed in the 17 year olds room and he slept on an air mattress in his brother's room. Not only did she never think to thank him, but she also tried banning him from going in the room at all when he occasionally needed to. One morning he knocked on the door to ask if he could go in to grab his sneakers and she said no and wouldn't even pass them to him. I had to intervene and get them myself. Despite this he was nothing but polite to her face. If I listed every passive aggressive thing she said/did to the boys during her stay it would make this post to long.\n\nOn Friday, the 13 yo and toddler were playing outside with a basketball. At one point 13 yo threw the ball a little too hard at his brother and knocked him over. My mom had been outside and saw what happened and started to berate the 13 yo and grabbing him hard by the arm. When his mom came outside to see why the baby was crying my mom continued to say foul things about my stepson and called him an awful brother and dangerous to her grandson. When stepson told his mom what he had accidentally done, my mom started raving about him doing it on purpose.\n\nWhen I got home my stepson was sulking in his room. My wife had told me what had happened, so I went to see him, and we talked. He vented about how my mom had made him feel the whole week and asked me why she hated him and his brother. This made me angry and after talking with my wife, I decided to ask my mom to leave and told her she wouldn\u2019t be welcome back until she corrected her attitude towards my stepsons. Of course, she didn\u2019t take this well and after she argued with me for over an hour she left. Later I got a call from my dad who was livid, he wouldn\u2019t let me explain myself, so I hang up.\n\nI feel I did the right thing to protect my stepsons, but my siblings are also upset with me. They think I\u2019m an ass for treating our mom badly and overreacting. Even my wife thinks we shouldn\u2019t have kicked her out but instead talked to her and given her a chance to change her behaviour.

Not your parents or their feelings.", "NTA and thank god cause I needed a good step dad story after the last post.  \n\nAnyways: Your mom doesn\u2019t need to love the kids exactly the same but if she can\u2019t treat them the same she shouldn\u2019t be around them and while it\u2019s rough I\u2019m sure the kids will appreciate you having their back.", "You are a good man, standing up for your children.", "NTA protect ALL your kids. She essentially assaulted your SS.", "NTA. You did the right thing and all the children will always remember it.  I guess your mom doesn't have enough love to go around.", "NTA. I got an uncle Ben, and he has a cousin named Ben. Some names are really good I guess.", "She grabbed him. She has no right to touch him or discipline him. \n\nYou did the right thing. There is no reason  a child shouldn't be comfortable in their own home. \n\nShame on her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. A good parent protects their family, which you are doing. No one should treat children poorly or differently from other kids in the home.", "NTA. And your wife is weak. Her sons will see that she didn't have their back and they'll always remember it.", "NTA, not a drop. They've been treating them so visibly less than for some time, what she did to the 13 year old should have been absolutely the last straw.", "NTA, good job.", "NTA. You did absolutely the right thing. It sounds like your mother was borderline abusive towards your stepkids and that is not okay. I have noticed a pattern where people who are abusive and their enablers say that someone is \"overreacting\" when you are just setting boundaries and protecting your family. \n\nThanks for being an awesome stepdad! The world needs more like you.", "NTA, your mom was way out of line!", "What your mom did was abusive.  You were absolutely right to throw her out, and I'm proud of you for being such a good stepdad.  Those boys are your kids just as much as your other three.  \n\nThis is the easiest NTA I've ever seen.", "I would make sure it was a real apology too. Not the \u201csorry you felt that way\u201d kind of thing. \n\nEven then, I probably wouldn\u2019t allow her back to stay. It\u2019s doubtful that she will have changed her mindset on a fundamental level and it would probably just be her trying to play the quick\u201cfix\u201d response that she believes will get her back to her \u201creal\u201d grandkids.", "Yes, and she doesn't just need to apologize to you and your wife.  She needs to apologize *sincerely* to the boys.", "When she wouldn\u2019t let him get his sneakers I\u2019d have at least kicked her out of his room - out of the house would\u2019ve been better. What a vile human she is.", "Agreed. This went on too long.", "Sadly, probably trying to \"keep the peace\"", "I don't have any of my own. But put a hand on one of my nieces or nephews (some of whom are whole ass grown human beings with Littles of their own). I dare you.", "So your dad and siblings are fine with your mother verbally and physically abusing a child? \nNTA well done for standing up for all your kids tho a little shame you didn\u2019t do so earlier with her treatment of the kids for years.", ">Even my wife thinks we shouldn\u2019t have kicked her out but instead talked to her and given her a chance to change her behaviour.\n\n>Of course, she didn\u2019t take this well and after she argued with me for over an hour she left.\n\nSounds like you did give her a chance. \n\n\n>One morning he knocked on the door to ask if he could go in to grab his sneakers and she said no and wouldn't even pass them to him.\n\nStep or not, child or adult, that is really like a slap in the face. She is a guest in somebody else's room and she can't even be decent enough to allow them to get their belongings? She is openly saying \"you're not even worth being decent to.\" NTA.  I would be NC until your stepsons got a real apology and even then it would go to LC or stay NC.", "NTA.\nYou did the right thong, kudos on being a good father and husband.", "NTA you didn\u2019t a great job standing up for your stepson", "NTA I just wish you had kicked her out sooner.\n\nYour mother is a monster, and it's your job to protect your children. The fact of the matter is that those boys ARE your children now, and she's treating them like garbage because of some bullshit ideas about blood.\n\nI guarantee your wife is only saying that you should have talked to your mother again because she's worried about being blamed by your family for the situation, or her boys being further outcast. Reassure her that you will do what it takes to protect and support her and your boys from your toxic family.", "NTA Go you, you are awesome", "NTA. Her casual cruelty to your stepkids in their own home is intolerable. Not letting him retrieve shoes from his own room is inexcusable and insane.", "There\u2019s no changing her behavior. She will always be this way.", "NTA you did the right thing. Not all family is biological. I love my chosen family just as much as my bio family.", "Your family relationship is giving me hope! \n\nIt's really nice to finally read about a happily blended family here. It's absolutely heartwarming to hear about how you stood up for your stepson and especially how he felt safe to communicate with you.\n\nWhatever you and your wife are doing is working for your family. Don't let your mother or anyone else hurt the family you've built.", "NTA. Protect your stepchildren. You are failing as a parent if you allow your parents to alienate half your family.", "Finally a r/AITA post involving a blended family where one of the parents does the right thing to support step kids. NTA.", "You did awesome defending your stepsons. NTA at all!!! Your mom needs to apologize or never be allowed around any of them.  I have a \u201cstep\u201d daughter who\u2019s only 9months younger than me & she\u2019s treated like she\u2019s my sister in a way from my parents cause the grand daughter part is odd feeling given the close age. But her kids & her step son so great grandkids to my parents have been welcomed with open arms. My dad was even at the hospital for the youngest\u2019s birth. Blood doesn\u2019t mean family. They are all your children no matter what & should be treated equally by all!!!", "NTA.\nThere is NOTHING Worse than an adult making kids feel unloved. Except when no one calls it out. \nHow would your mom feel if your Bio-children were treated this way by your ex-wifes new husband's family? \nThe fact that she thinks it's okay to treat kids like this says a lot about her. \nGood for YOU!!!", "NTA.  People have to want to change their behavior.  Don't give people chances that they won't use and will only exploit you further.", "NTA", "NTA, those are your children and she\u2019s treating them like shit. It\u2019s your absolute duty to be the one who stands up for them. Maybe when her temper cools you can have a conversation where you explain that they are your family and she should treat them as such but no, I would have done the same thing. NTA", "NTA\n\nAll of your children will remember you treating them equally and protecting them. You might want to point this out to your wife once everyone has cooled down. Kids remember things like this, and hold onto it, whether for good or bad.", "NTA. \nIt's not the first time that she has done something like this and so she has had multiple chances to correct the behaviour. I'm of the opinion that as parents (to biological or stepchildren as there is no difference to me) we have to protect our children before we satisfy parents petty behaviour and feelings.", "NTA\n\nPresents are another issue.\n\nBut she has no excuse for putting a child down.\n\nUnforgivable.", "Nta, poor lads. You handled it fantastically.\nIt's clear though,\n no matter how you talk to her about it.\nYour mom clearly won't change.\nThe fact she feels she has the right to even rough handle them is disgusting,\n I don't see that mentality changing", "Not just apologize, but also prove to both you and your stepsons that her behavior has permanently changed. She needs to do a lot of work from a distance to rebuild trust with them, or every interaction with her will strain their relationship with you and their mom if they feel pressured to accept her back while they still feel unsafe and attacked \n\nNTA and I'm really glad you stood up for your kids.", "Agreed. And write your Dad and siblings a comprehensive list of the things your mom has done, until her assault and unwarranted accusation against you stepson brought things to a boiling point.", "I would also make sure the rest of the family knows the real story of what happened and how she's been treating them. If they still side with her, I'd say it's time for a period of NC.", "I mean, most married couples have family that isn't biological: their partner."]}
