{"id": 12386, "submission_id": "11s9wyy", "title": "AITA for asking my mom to leave my home because of how she treated my stepsons?", "selftext": "My wife has two sons with her ex-husband (13 & 17), I have two daughters with my ex-wife (10 & 12), and together we have an almost two year old son together. All our kids get along well, and we have a good relationship with each other\u2019s children.\n\nMy parents are very doting grandparents to my 3 bio kids but have always been standoffish with my stepsons. There has been lots of little things over the years that have shown how little they care for them. They have never once bought them a birthday present (my wife's parents get my daughter's gifts) and at Christmas they are always given the most pathetic/cheap gift. It's not always bad as there has been times when, my dad in particular, has been good at engaging with them. In November he came with me and the boys to watch a football game and go out for lunch and everybody had a great time.\n\nLast week my mom stayed with us as it was my daughter's 10th birthday. She stayed in the 17 year olds room and he slept on an air mattress in his brother's room. Not only did she never think to thank him, but she also tried banning him from going in the room at all when he occasionally needed to. One morning he knocked on the door to ask if he could go in to grab his sneakers and she said no and wouldn't even pass them to him. I had to intervene and get them myself. Despite this he was nothing but polite to her face. If I listed every passive aggressive thing she said/did to the boys during her stay it would make this post to long.\n\nOn Friday, the 13 yo and toddler were playing outside with a basketball. At one point 13 yo threw the ball a little too hard at his brother and knocked him over. My mom had been outside and saw what happened and started to berate the 13 yo and grabbing him hard by the arm. When his mom came outside to see why the baby was crying my mom continued to say foul things about my stepson and called him an awful brother and dangerous to her grandson. When stepson told his mom what he had accidentally done, my mom started raving about him doing it on purpose.\n\nWhen I got home my stepson was sulking in his room. My wife had told me what had happened, so I went to see him, and we talked. He vented about how my mom had made him feel the whole week and asked me why she hated him and his brother. This made me angry and after talking with my wife, I decided to ask my mom to leave and told her she wouldn\u2019t be welcome back until she corrected her attitude towards my stepsons. Of course, she didn\u2019t take this well and after she argued with me for over an hour she left. Later I got a call from my dad who was livid, he wouldn\u2019t let me explain myself, so I hang up.\n\nI feel I did the right thing to protect my stepsons, but my siblings are also upset with me. They think I\u2019m an ass for treating our mom badly and overreacting. Even my wife thinks we shouldn\u2019t have kicked her out but instead talked to her and given her a chance to change her behaviour.

Good for you for being a good step dad", "NTA because you finally took action to stop her behavior, but you're trending on the asshole side based on this continuing for years without response.\n\nIf you back down, you will be an asshole because this is purely bullshit behavior you've overlooked far too long. Your bar for your dad being a good companion on an outing is such an underwhelming standard. You knew your mom was heinous and an asshole while a guest in your son's room before she laid a finger on your other son or maligned his character and integrity.

Your siblings can just put a sock in their opinions--they weren't there and they haven't been having to deal with her crap on this issue.  You were being a good, supportive stepfather and not letting your stepson be abused or marginalized by your mother and I'm sure he very much appreciates your support.  Please keep on being that good stepdad and don't let your mother back in the house or make your stepchildren deal with her until she corrects that nasty attitude of hers and make appropriate apologies.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
