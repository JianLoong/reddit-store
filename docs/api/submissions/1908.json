His sister and her husband just had a baby at 30 weeks via emergency C-Section due to severe preeclampsia. Now the baby has a lengthy NICU stay ahead. They started a GoFundMe to help pay for the hospital bills. This was a planned pregnancy (the sister posts excessively on social media about absolutely everything in their personal lives).\n\nThe family has asked if I would donate, and instead of lying and saying that I don\u2019t have the means to donate, I said I wasn\u2019t comfortable with donating, so now they\u2019re curious as to why. \n\nFirst, they have health insurance through their employer. A lengthy NICU stay is undoubtedly more expensive than the out of pocket maximum on their health insurance. So they aren\u2019t asking for help to pay for the baby\u2019s entire NICU stay. They\u2019re asking for help to pay their out of pocket maximum. This is a known amount when you sign up for health insurance, and I feel any wise person takes this into account when selecting a health plan. In my experience, when you are selecting your health insurance for the year, you have a choice between a low cost plan with a high deductible / high out of pocket maximum, or a high cost plan with a low deductible / low out of pocket maximum. So they either made a poor decision by selecting a plan with an out of pocket maximum they can\u2019t afford, or maybe their employer just doesn\u2019t offer very good health insurance, and they didn\u2019t have an option for a low out of pocket maximum.\n\nEither way, when they were signing up for health insurance and saw that the out of pocket maximum was more than they can afford, why not sign up for hospital indemnity insurance? It is extremely low cost. So even without knowing their specifics, I feel confident that their poor decision making / planning contributed to them being in this financial hole.\n\nThe second element as to why I am hesitant to donate is because I feel like they are asking for a handout instead of making a reasonable effort to address the problem themselves. I can\u2019t imagine the out of pocket maximum for their insurance is any more than $20,000. Anything higher is unheard of. They have been homeowners for 4 years, and regardless of how much money they put down, they have a good chunk of equity based on how much property values have gone up in this area. At the current WSJ Prime Rate (7%), a $20,000 HELOC would cost $117/month for 10 years (interest only payments) and $232/month for years 10-20. I see their lifestyle on instagram daily. They can absolutely afford this, and could probably pay the HELOC off in 5 years or less. But instead of taking responsibility for their poor decision making / planning and paying it off themselves, they\u2019re asking for a handout.\n\nAm I the asshole for not donating?\n\nEdit: I have not shared my reasonings for not donating with the family. I have just stated that I\u2019m not comfortable with it", "created_utc": 1668021206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqsgtc/aita_for_not_donating_to_a_friends_gofundme_for/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you know what kind of additional expenses they may face with a pre-mature baby?  Long term complications?  No one plans for all this despite their best planning, insurance, etc.  Babies are expensive even when things go well.\n\nStop being so judgmental and petty.  Throw some dollars their way.

They really don't need to be punished because they didn't have the foresight to get every layer of insurance out there, and that's how you seem to be treating this.\n\nUltimately you're not punishing them by not donating, but if you start lecturing them on what they \"should\" have done then I'm definitely changing my opinion.", "NTA for not contributing.

You are under no obligation to donate, but good lord does this come across as extremely cold and unfeeling. \n\nYou seem blissfully unaware of the kinds of unexpected things that can happen in life. I have all of those things as well (insurance, savings, supportive family, etc) but I also know that shit happens. Covid was a perfect example of how you can think you\u2019re ready for anything and then you get a curveball to the head. \n\nIt is very presumptuous and short-sighted of you to have this kind of take.

I live in Canada and didn\u2019t pay a dime for her stay, but we rolled through our emergency savings and more. Most expensive month in recent memory. \n\nGas to get to the hospital every day. Food (more than usual if the mother lactates, but nobody has energy or even time to cook). Bills. Insurance.

Therapy for the trauma of going through NICU. Medication to manage the extremely high likelihood of one or both parents developing PPD/PPA/PPP\n\nFrom personal experience, the only thing more traumatizing than having a baby in NICU is never leaving the hospital with the baby you walked in with. Funds to apply to literally any of these incidentals can make a huge difference. I would probably not be here if I had had to worry about any sort of financial strain from the hospital stay on top of everything else. \n\nYou have every right not to donate and would not be the asshole for not donating, but the logic you\u2019re using as your reasoning lacks humanity and a broader view of the situation.\n\nEdit: removed the word \u201cgentle\u201d before my judgement after I read this out loud to my husband.", "YTA not for refusing to donate, but for not having the social grace to do anything else except criticize people going through a serious health issue during pregnancy for what you perceive as bad financial decisions.

I would also take some time to examine why you have zero empathy.", "It\u2019s okay not to donate to a Go Fund Me but your reasoning makes YTA.", "**ESH**\n\n...and let me be abundantly clear, it has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with your decision not to hand over money. You are NEVER EVER an AH for choosing not to donate to a GoFundMe. And neither are the family AHs for asking for help, in general, from friends and family in a difficult situation that is going to cost them potentially tens of thousands of dollars. This would pretty much be a neutral N-A-H situation except for two things, both of which, unsurprisingly, involve people being unable to keep their mouths shut or behave like decent human beings: \n\n1) The family are AHs for specifically approaching individuals such as yourself and asking you to donate. Totally inappropriate. Having a GoFundMe so that people can help with a massive medical debt is not an AH thing to do. The reality is that we're living in the 21st century and people have to start off their baby's life having incurred a massive medical debt to begin with, or having to pay tens of thousands of dollars for their child to be born safely under challenging and dangerous medical circumstances. But putting individuals on the spot by asking them (in this case you, and I'm sure others) to donate is not only tacky but aggressively inappropriate because it makes it difficult for people to say no, which is not okay. People should be afforded the OPPORTUNITY to help, not be made to feel like they are OBLIGATED to help. \n\n2) You are an AH because you aren't required to help, but no one asked you for your opinion about whether or not this family \"can absolutely afford this\" (which, BTW, no you cannot accurately assess based on anecdotal social media posts). No one asked you to hold forth in an incredibly condescending manner about how you feel the medical debt incurred in the course of their child's traumatic birth was because of \"poor decision making\" on their part (I'm sure your hindsight is, in fact 20/20; congratulations). Every word of your unasked-for assessment and breakdown of what they did wrong and what they should have done instead reads as not only deeply arrogant but shockingly lacking in empathy, and completely unnecessary.  No one asked. All you had to do was say, \"I'm sorry but I cannot donate right now.\" If pressed for a reason, the appropriate response is, \"That's personal and I would rather not discuss it.\" The end. \n\nESH.

Seems kinda entitled to assume that all insurance through work are the same when they really aren't.  \n\nThe total lack of empathy is just the worst though.  It is purely a blessing that it seems OP has never had to have an emergency major surgery (all forms of birth are considered a major surgery the last I checked) which followed up with an unclear hospital stay.

I just want you to better understand the reality of most people. It's a systemic issue, and crowdsourcing medical bills is certainly not sustainable. But I promise their employers have already paid multiple times their out of pocket, and yet that cost is still passed on to us.

No, we can\u2019t foresee things like this NICU stay usually, that\u2019s why we buy insurance. It\u2019s the fact they\u2019re essentially affluent and asking for handouts I find appalling. The go fund me thing has gotten outta hand.  I\u2019m with you. And no is a complete response, and leaves your judgment out of it. NTA in my book.

First, one or both parents will be out of work much longer than originally planned. Their income will be impacted in ways they never expected with this pregnancy. Second, all the travel to/from the hospital in the coming weeks will add up super fast.
