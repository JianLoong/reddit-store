Besides just plain being rude by talking shift about your family that is taking care of her & the baby, She\u2019s acting entitled.\n\nI was a teen mom who was working before I got pregnant & stayed working afterwards, so I understand a lot more than some people but she doesn\u2019t deserve anything besides support (financially, emotionally, mentally). She could stay at the house but it\u2019s not exactly where she wants to. Your mom even gave her money to help.
