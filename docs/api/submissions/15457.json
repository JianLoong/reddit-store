When we were kids, she made my life a living hell. She was abusive. She would steal, call me names, and bully me and many other kids, among other things. My parents tried everything; school counselling, grounding, sending her to stay with a relative for a short time, therapy, medication, doctors. Everything. She continued to act out, to an unnatural degree. She would scream at me or my parents, and would routinely leave my mother in tears. Our entire extended family couldn't stand her because she acted this way toward our cousins, aunts, uncles, and other family members as well. They often left our family out of events, causing my mother especially to feel even more isolated.\n\nShe would lock herself in the bathroom and scream insults when they tried to take her to therapy and refused to see the counsellor. She snuck out and destroyed things when they grounded her. Refused to take anything the doctors prescribed, and would refuse to go to appointments. The whole thing came to a head when she was 18. I won't go into detail, but it involved a lighter, and the family cat. My parents had enough and kicked her out because we had other pets and a young cousin who would come and stay often. They decided she was too much to take care of.\n\nFast forward 6 years and none of us have heard from her since she was 19 and stopped coming around and harassing random family members. She reached out to me and seems to be doing better, not that I actually trust her or want to meet her. She wants me to put her in contact with our parents. I don't think that's a good idea. They don't want to see her.  She was a horrific bully, and none of us really feel it would be good to have her around. Maybe I'm being harsh, but it was a lot of years of abuse to put up with. My parents nearly got divorced because of her lying about my dad having an affair, and my mother is still seeing a therapist to deal with the way my sister treated her. So am I.\n\nI told her our parents don't want to see her. She got upset and demanded to know why, saying things about how\" they have to talk to their own child\" and how they abandoned her and all that. I told her that her actions were too much for them and that they don't have to ever speak to her again. AITA?\n\nEdit: I have told my parents, and they declined because my mother would not be able to handle it. I am speaking for them for the same reason. I should've mentioned that.

Not sure if that's the case here, but could very well be.", "*They decided she was too much to take care of*\n\n**They realized that they couldn't keep others safe if she were in the house** is my take on this statement.\n\nYour sister sounds very frightening, and who knows what her motives are to reestablish contact.  My first wayward, alarming thought was the discussion in another thread today about life insurance killers.\n\nDocument every contact with her, even if it seem innocuous.  Watch for patterns.  Hope that you gather enough information to get a restraining order.\n\nI knew someone with a difficult relative who demonstrated bizarre behavior, and they finally just moved halfway across the country to get away from them.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\n> She wants me to put her in contact with our parents.\n\nShe's an adult and fully capable of contacting them on her own. She has already been abusive to you, so don't let her push you around or try and manipulate you into thinking it's your job to get them re-connected. \n\nWhether she wants to re-connect with them for financial reasons or  to make amends, let her be responsible for once. If she's getting angry and demanding things of you, then she probably hasn't done anything to work on herself.", "NTA\n\nit sounds like your sister has ODD or something similar. your parents tried, she refused. cutting her off was valid, and it's up to them if they want to welcome her into their lives again.", "NTA and cut off contact. Finish therapy then decide if you want contact with her. Focus on yourself now.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to work to regain trust and contact and responding to you in that way when you said no is not indicative of someone who is fully in control of their behaviours. She wasn\u2019t abandoned, she was 18, a adult and refusing the treatments that she needed. \n\nI hope your whole family finds healing in their own way and time, and reintroducing her before their ready isn\u2019t healthy.", "I think her response to your refusal is all the info you need. If she had truly made progress and become more rational, she would understand others' unwillingness to meet with her. That she immediately got upset shows she's still where she was.\n\nYou should let your parents know that she's contacted you. You don't want them blindsided if she finds another way (besides you) to get in touch with them, but you have no obligation to make the connection between them and her.\n\nNTA.

Seems like she still needs lots of help.", "NTA With her past history it's very likely she wants to contact them because she is in trouble and wants to use them for money. She showed zero remorse or accountability for her past behavior, so it's very unlikely she has changed her ways. I wouldn't trust her.", "Personally, and especially if the poor cat survived the.. lighter... incident, you are making the smart decision. I think if you keep in contact with her let her know that you will only let your parents know of her contact info when she's proven to you that she has grown and has taken accountability (doesn't sound like she has) for herself in the past. Until then, you aren't doing anything wrong by protecting them and yourself from her.\n\nNTA", "If she is demanding to get her way and trying to guilt you, she hasn't changed or at least hasn't changed enough for it to be a good idea.

She hasn't changed much if at all if she's playing the victim by saying they abandoned her. Especially considering what you mentioned about the cat. There is no coming back from something that heinous.\n\nEta:  Warn your parents though.

We Need To Talk About Kevin kinda shit. I\u2019d keep away", "NTA\n\nI'd be like, you got memory problems?  You know exactly what you did and if you want forgiveness, it's gonna be on their timetable, not yours.  Gimme a contact number and if they call you, fine.  If they don't call you...well, you're just gonna have to live with it.  It's not up to you if you get forgiveness, but you can get therapy to acknowledge your guilt, because you *know* why they didn't want you home.", "NTA! Your sister is toxic to the entire family.

Sister/daughter or not.", "So much NTA. My brother is like this, and it is awful. He's on medication, in therapy, in every program avaliable to us and nothing is helping.

I can also share that I\u2019ve seen it manifest from SA that wasn\u2019t reported. I hope that\u2019s not the case here. It was, in my extended family\u2019s case.
