This kid will grow up with food issues if left to that woman.", "Is this an actual comment or satire? Honestly it's hard to tell its so stupid", "\"It doesn't sound like you have a valid reason to include them\" Maybe she had a sandwich with them in? \n\nShe's old enough to be in the kitchen prepping her lunch, she's old enough to not eat them if she doesn't want them or if they do infect make her smell bad.", "What exactly is OP supposed to do here? If the mom is hell bent on being unreasonable what exactly are OP's choices?", "Onions are delicious.", "What is this treachery? The thunderdome it is!", "I think you're fighting a losing battle my friend. Everyone knows onions are the best thing ever. Hamburgers need those onions to survive dude.", "Damn, I never thought I\u2019d find a fellow onion hater (besides my cousin, but he\u2019s family). Do you by chance also hate garlic?", "How??? He\u2019s feeding her a food she likes with no allergy or health concerns. This isn\u2019t a reasonable thing for her mother to control", "OP never states that daughter has any allergy to onion or anything, so I am failing to understand what concequence the daughter would be facing here?", "What\u2019s the point of posting here with your terrible assumptions and horrible lack of reading comprehension? Are you the ex???", "I don't think letting the co-parent dictate the kids life with bullshit stuff like \"you stink eating something you like\" a good parent wouldn't be complicit to that bullshit and give the daughter the impression that what the mom does it totally normal and fine.", "NTA but save yourself a headache and let your ex know you won't be engaging in conversations about food any longer. You have every right to feed your daughter what you want to in your home, so just use the gray rock method and refuse to give any energy or emotion to this topic.\n\nex: You fed her food that was on the no-no list!\n\nYou: I'm not going to discuss this topic with you any further.\n\nex: How dare you! You are going to cause her to be bullied...\n\nYou: Again, I will be ignoring all comments on this topic from now on. And then follow through and do not respond at all.", "Onions are some of the best food, don't let your daughter miss out on them.", "Also, I never like onion, or anything related taste wise, until close to adulthood. My sweat still smelled like sour onions, so it's probably not the onions that make your daughter smell bad, if she actually smells bad at all.", "If the daughter really liked onions, why were they left over? Are you sure daughter didn\u2019t take them off the meal herself?", "As long as it isn't a health/allergy issue she cannot control what you feed your own daughter on your parenting time", "I'm guessing the reason is control. It's *her* daughter so OP better do what *she* wants.", "I was the same way, literally until i was 18 I was such a picky eater bc my parents never forced me to try new foods. Then I decided I was gonna make myself try everything and learn to like new things and now I love onions on everything lol", "I have a 10-year-old at home and sometimes they smell. This is about the age for kids start needing to wear deodorant. And hormones are weird, meaning that sometimes they really need to wear deodorant and other days they could skip it and you wouldn't notice.\n\nI'm betting that Mom noticed a smell one day and is trying to connect the dots where there are no dots.", "Actually the food-sweat odor link *is* a thing!\n\nBut the more important thing here is that the behavior OP describes here is not \"munchausen's\" at all. I realize this is just a random comment on an aita thread, but it's still important not to place labels like this one incorrectly.", "> munchausen's by proxy\n\nAre you for real?\n\nEating onions (and many other foods) really does affect your smell by the way.", "My poor niece is suffering with this and she got it from her dad. Hopefully the two younger girls don't but I feel so bad for her, if she doesn't check the labels on everything she can randomly end up with a body odour issue that her family struggles to be around and she can't do anything until it all sweats out.", "She\u2019s olde enough to decide what she likes then", "Oh good lord. NTA\n\nYou handled it beautifully, I'd say. It's friggin *onion,* Mom. This isn't a health or safety issue, and it certainly isn't one of those big, important issues that separated coparents need to agree on. Good. Grief. Let the kid eat, make sure the kid bathes -- two separate issues that your ex is trying to combine into one for the sake of her own projected insecurities.", "Not allowing your daughter to have onions because they make her smell bad is a really bad excuse. Onions have amazing health benefits such as being packed with antioxidants and vitamin c. They are also anti-inflammatory. The only way a person \u2018smells\u2019 bad after eating onions is if they eat them in huge quantities. If she is not allergic then she needs to eat the rainbow of vegetable for health reason. Your ex is creating problems where there are none.", "What?", "Out of pure morbid curiosity, what other foods has your ex deemed unacceptable and does she have even more ludicrous reasons why? NTA btw.", "I expect it was this line \"It pisses me off when she tells me what to do, so maybe that is clouding my judgement.\" It sounds like he is primed to say no to his ex purely because it pisses him off to be told anything. And, sometimes, things are going to have to be told to him.", "Just create a list with all the food that is not on the mothers list and give it to the mother.

You don't have to give her any control or energy. Just smile and give her the same amount of control as you would a random stranger in the grocery check-out line. \n\nIf a child has a controlling parent, she'll see it soon enough. Be the parent who she can feel safe with. And whatever you do, don't comment on your ex's behavior. At all. Your future self will thank you. So will your daughter.", "Talk to the mother in private and maybe, just maybe get a third party like a therapist or so involved. But if they continue like that, the girl will always be torn between the parents. And that's just plain horrible. The adults here should act as adults, not like toddlers who don't get what they want. *Both* parents need to find a solution, together. And be responsible, for *their* daughter. If that needs a third, helping party, they should do it. Maybe making a contract about their parenting. A base on wich they all agree and can life with", "You know why you cry when you cut onions? It is your body rejecting such heinous organic form.", "Onions gave disgraced humanity for far too long. Let's evolve all human race by ceasing the consumption of such horrible plant.", "A losing battle, probably. But still worth fighting for :)", "Hi fellow onion hater. Know you are not alone.

The most terrible thing that can afflict a youngun. /s", "You can't \"let\" a co-parent do anything.

Heaven forbid the child eats a vegetable she likes.", "I eat raw onion daily   At breakfast and lunch   Approximately 1/3 of medium onion per day.  Yeah, my breath stinks but it\u2019s not the end of the world", "Exactly, just make sure she\u2019s brushing her teeth and she should smell fine lmao.

I eat slivered onions on all kinds of things.", "It really could be just slivers. Or it could be that the kid takes the onion off and just keeps the peace with dad by not saying anything. Maybe Mom is trying to not throw kid under the bus while also advocating for kiddo. \nJust a different perspective .", "Odd isn\u2019t it lol. When I had my morning onion slices today I left a couple little slivers on the plate.", "Unless she's afraid of her dad", "The horror!", "Not joking, but I puked when I tried them haha", "I wish this is a crusader kings joke haha\nNot weaker, instead: superior tastes", "It is only fit for demons and lower life forms like worms.  \nI loved your comment", "Unfortunately they always seem to forget. Specially fast food places (Mac Donald's I'm talking about you). \nMy problem stands more for home cooked meals. Everyone seems to only know how to make sauces and others using onion. There are lots of great alternatives that don't make me ill, but the answer most common is: it is impossible to make hotdog sauce without onions. If you are from the US you probably don't know about onions in hot dogs, but in Brazil it becomes disgusting", "Wow you're such a jerk! Feeding yourself onions even though you obviously don't like them. And they make you smell bad.", "Why jump to that conclusion? She could be so scared of her mum that she's afraid to say that she does want to eat onion.\n\nThe fact is, neither of us have enough information to assume such a thing, so such assumptions should not be made.", "You mean her mom", "Hey, pro tip here, just because you are unfortunate enough to not like something delicious, that doesn't mean you should shit on other people for what they enjoy.
