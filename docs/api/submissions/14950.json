Wow you just avoided a coercively controlling relationship. Love bombing on the first date!!! Glad you noticed the red flags, they all were. I\u2019m so glad you are safe glad, don\u2019t ever get in a pushy man\u2019s car! \n\nYou NEVER owe someone like this an explanation, you did the right thing.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t ever speak to that guy again and don\u2019t feel bad about it.", "NTA. He chose to pay for the whole bill when you were away from the table without even discussing it with you first, and then threw that back at you when you wanted to go home at the end of your date. What a weird, aggressive thing to do. Sounds like this date was purely transactional to him. \n\nPersonally, I think you would be better off not ever contacting him again. I would be wary of someone who loses their temper so easily and gets very angry and sulky about not getting their way, especially with someone they literally *just met.* I'd stay far away from him.", "NTA - glad you got out of there safely.", "NTA - He sounds like a very entitled guy. Buying your date dinner doesn\u2019t entitle you to anything else, especially if he offered to pay. Don\u2019t feel bad about blocking him, I\u2019m glad you found out early on what kind of person he is.", "NTA. I personally always split bills, but in this case he paid while you were in the bathroom and clearly didn't care about paying when he disgustingly assumed he was getting laid. Noone \"owes\" anyone else sex.", "NTA. A man who only is willing to pay for his date's dinner if she sleeps with him is treating his date like a hooker.\n\nWhile I've luckily never needed to try the online dating scene, I would personally call out that behaviour out specifically before blocking. \"You chose to tell the waitress one bill, you don't get to change your mind about paying for my meal because I didn't want to go home with you. I'm not a cheap hooker, dinner wasn't payment for future sex that didn't happen.\" (Block immediately).\n\nIn terms of your noncommittal answers during the date... do be more upfront in the future when you already know you don't plan to go home with a guy when he's making suggestions while still in a public place. It's much safer for you to get cussed out in a restaurant and potentially stuck with the bill than having to explain to a guy you're not going home with him when you're already in his car. I'm not going to call you an asshole for not handling that perfectly, though, it didn't sound like you were doing so to manipulate him into paying the bill but because you were nervous about saying it to a guy who was bleeding red flags?", "NTA. if he wanted to go dutch, that should've been established prior to him paying for the bill. im so tired of people thinking if you dont follow them home on the first date you just wanted a free dinner.", "NTA\nHe chose to pay and it seems it was conditional on you sleeping with him.  This guy sounds like a total creep. Block him and get far away.", "NTA\n\nBut the very sad truth is, I would always split or outright pay for a first date, because there are too many men who believe that by paying for your meal or drinks, that you owe them 'something' in return, and as soon as it is clear they aren't getting that, they start to get nasty.\n\nIt shouldn't be that way and I'm not saying that anyone else should feel compelled to do the same as I do, but unfortunately that is the way I approach things to make myself feel that bit safer (I also don't ever get picked up or dropped off, I make my own way to the date and my own way home).", "NTA. He paid for it and said nothing about splitting. Also he sounds like the worst.", "NTA keep him blocked.  It was his idea to pick up the check and sounds like you would have split it anyway.", "NTA.

We texted a bit before the date and the conversation was nice. He said he was looking for something that would eventually lead to a serious relationship and I said I was looking for the same. \n\nThe date was fine, but right off the bat he came on a bit too strong by being too handsy (touching the small of my back, thigh, etc.). I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable with this much physical contact this early on, and he apologized and said it\u2019s because his love language is physical touch. Throughout the date he kept saying how wonderful I was and how he wanted us to keep dating during the summer so he could show me all his favorite spots, he said he\u2019s already feeling \u201cprotective\u201d of me. In hindsight there were a few red flags and I probably should have stopped the date much sooner. \n\nAnyway, towards the end he kept asking me if I wanted to go home with him, not because he wanted to sleep with me but just because he wanted me around and he didn\u2019t want the date to be over. I deflected/said I\u2019d think about it every time he asked. \n\nHe picked up the check while I was in the bathroom and asked if I was ready to leave when I got back. We got into his car and I asked if he was still willing to drive me home or drop me off somewhere along the way (he'd offered earlier in the date to give me a ride since he picked the place and it was a 50-minute subway ride for me). He seemed super taken aback, and said \"I thought the plan was to go back to my place, what are we doing?\" and \"well your neighborhood isn't on my way at all and I wasn't planning on going out there\". I asked if he could drop me off to the subway station 5 minutes away instead but if he couldn't that was fine too. He very begrudgingly agreed. Aside from a couple backhanded comments, he didn't say anything else the whole drive. I asked if he was okay and he said \"mhmm\". I thanked him for the ride and for dinner (he said \"yep\"), and I got out. \n\nLess than a minute later, he sends the following back-to-back texts:\n\n\"70 bucks is your for tonight is your half\" (verbatim)\n\n\"I'll send you my venmo\"\n\n\"What's your venmo\"\n\n\"That's cool. Just one of those looking for a free meal\"\n\n\u201cGood luck with that\u201d\n\n\u201cYou suck\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't be an asshole\u201d\n\nI didn't see his texts until the 4th message and he was typing the 5th. I started feeling really anxious and a little afraid that he would come to the subway stop and confront me. I blocked him because I felt like the messages would keep getting nastier and it was really getting to me. If he had asked me at the bar to split the bill I would have done it, but he chose to pay while I was gone and didn\u2019t say anything until after I\u2019d gotten out of the car. And then I guess he assumed I owed him sex in return. \n\nThis all happened last night and I haven't unblocked him or done anything yet, and I really don't want to engage with him again.  WIBTA if i left this as it is and didn't reach out to get his venmo and pay him back?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That precludes any guilting from dudes.", "Agree with the rest but OP should not contact him at all. The only safe procedure here is to block him.", "Huge lapse of judgment on my part getting into his car. It makes me anxious thinking of how badly that could have ended", "I'm sexually deprived and would never consider acting this way, lol. This guy is embarassing to the real men out there.", "This was what I was struggling with. I think not paying is an AH move, and if he would have asked for the bill while i was still there I\u2019d have offered to split. But I don\u2019t at all feel safe reaching out to him now. I even changed my venmo username to remove my last name in case he looks me up there to request I send money, changed my instagram to private, etc. I don\u2019t want him to be able to find me because he seemed really unstable", "This is a good take.", "The real shame is that we have to think that way at all, and certainly don't blame yourself for getting in the car, his behaviour is all on him.\n\nI will say though, that despite the bad experiences, you absolutely can meet good people on dating apps, my partner and I met on tinder of all places and have been together very happily for nearly two years now, so don't let this put you off.", "I agree that was a mistake. An Uber would be safer. Most women have had at least one encounter like this. You're safe and you've just learnt to be more careful next time.", "100% I'd feel the same way, and safety takes precedence here.", "How sad that you had to do any of this.", "Don't feel bad. That guy is potentially dangerous.", "I'm of the opinion first dates you split the bill,  or at least offer to pay your own way, but this should be discussed BEFORE the bill comes. He chose to pay, that then becomes a him problem and he can't retroactively say you need to pay because you didn't fulfill the contract that was all in his head. Keep him blocked and don't give your venmo. \nAlso, I'm glad you safely got dropped off."]}
