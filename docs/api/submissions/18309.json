After the ceremony was over as I was walking out I was stopped by my Mom and her friends and they told me they wanted to get a photo of me and my sister which I refused. My mom's friends caused a scene accusing me of ruining my sister graduation.

It seems very childish. Were you diagnosed by a doctor, or did you diagnose yourself? Siblings fight and pick on each other, unfortunately, but most people don't claim to have PTSD.", "NTA.

I hope you find a safe person to confide in and sort out the relationship issues, and that you get support for your mental health.

I wish you all the best.", "Hmm, I think it might be time to look at some other points of view. \n\nFirst of all, your sister is younger than you. She's not as developed as you are. Sometimes it's important to take that kind of stuff into consideration. \n\nAlso, although you both seemingly are growing up in the same home, it does not mean you have the same experiences. If your mom has an issue with you, it's really something your sister could have picked up unknowingly. \n\nAll that said, it's just a picture. Little things like that won't kill anyone and it might be something you want in the future, should you two develop a better relationship, or (not what we want) something traumatic happens. \n\nIt's very easy to think in forever, but most things aren't forever. \n\nESH", "Yep.

Also she\u2019s in middle school\u2026. Idk you guys are young and I agree with a lot of peoples comments if you think you have PTSD get diagnosed, also get diagnosed if it is because of her or not. Lots of people are into Self diagnosing so before making a claim get it checked. (Not saying you are but making a statement)", "Some people just dislike their siblings from the jump. My earliest memories of my sister are her telling me how much she hated me and wished I would die. She followed that up with tons of verbal and physical abuse including cornering me with her friends to berate my appearance, trying to break my arm, trying to drown me in a creek, and trying to talk me into discharging myself to Jesus.
