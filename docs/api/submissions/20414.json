There's absolutely nothing wrong or weird about not wanting to live with anyone other than your partner. It's an extremely common preference.

It's a red flag that they can't afford to rent on their own. They might not be able to make rent, or they might mooch off the groceries you pay for. Maybe you should just get your own place and let your boyfriend live with them.

Are they going to be roommates until you are 40? It sounds like your bf is the one who needs to think about it before jumping into that kind of scenario.", "NTA. When you agreed to move in together, it was under certain terms (which were completely reasonable). Now he wants to change the terms and still hold you to the agreement.", "NTA, but his apparent inability (or refusal) to live on his own should be a huge red flag for you.", "NTA\n\nif Lord Bountiful wants to help out his friends, then why not give them money directly so they can rent their own place?   I'm glad you're saying no to this and I don't blame you in the least.  \n\nEven if you knew these friends, it's a whole different bag of worms to live with another couple in a financially uneven situation (evictions aren't fun and freeloaders can get really pissy when you try to kick them out)\n\nSounds like you should just start house hunting on your own and let Mr Moneybags and his freeloaders sort themselves out.", "NTA - I totally get it.

You have every right to choose how you want to live your life. It\u2019s unfortunate that his friends are unable to afford to live without roommates but it is not your responsibility to to fill that role.

Yes, being able to afford your own place is definitely a privilege in this day and age. That being said, it\u2019s not wrong to want to exercise that privilege\u2014acknowledging you have something and having it anyway doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. You\u2019re not obliged to downgrade your comfort for someone else, especially since, sorry to say, but if they\u2019re still needing a flat share at nearly 40, there\u2019s probably no solid end date in sight.", "NTA. Good God, OP. He's not worth the trouble. Who could suggest something so stupid! Run", "couples sharing a house or a flat is not for everyone.  You don't it.  No is a complete sentence.\n\nYour BF is a not respecting your wishes.  \n\nNTA", "NTA.  More flatmates, more drama, and you will be miserable.  You know yourself and what your needs are; he\u2019s literally asking you to set yourself on fire to keep his friends warm.  Now that you know that he thinks you\u2019re a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d, do you really want to live with him, either?  It is clear his verbal abuse and attempts to manipulate you and destroy your boundaries are not going to stop.  Is this something you can tolerate long-term?", "NTA he's acting like a child who can't have his friends over. Are you sure you want to have a life with some one like this? If so you need to sit down and talk about why he's completely unreasonable. Also you might need couples counciling as I thing he needs to learn that \"no I don't want to\" is a complete and fair sentence to this situation", "NTA\nGood thing you've only been dating a year. A 35 year old man shouldn't want to have friends living in his home when he has a romantic partner there. Wouldn't that kill the vibe? Especially since y'all don't need the extra money to pay bills.\nIdk, that sort of thing is normal when you're a kid, or in your 20s and money is tight, but he doesn't fit those scenarios. \nSeems like he's codependent in regards to friends/family if he can't seem to handle not living with them. I don't think he's mature enough for you.", "NTA. I can even understand having such good friends you prefer to share even if you don't need it financially (been there, done that). But everyone should not just agree, but actively want it, or it won't work out. So your bf had to drop this after you've said no. \n\nBesides, the whole is just so super weird. I presume the friends aren't currently homeless, so they obviously are able to solve their housing problem independently. Or they are Adam's current flatmates and he's dragging them into his new relationship? Is the rent not a problem for each of you separately or just for you or you and Adam together, but not for Adam alone? Honestly, I get the vibes of him \"helping\" his friends with your money.\n\nOverall, it's not bad that Adam has friends he cares about so much. What is bad is that he doesn't care about his GF at all. Your relationship are less important for him then his friendship, and it's up to you to decide if this is your cup of tea. But you need to keep in mind that he'll never put you first if he doesn't now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I waited longer to move out until I could afford an apartment all on my own, and the closest I\u2019d ever consider to having roommates would be a \u201cmother in law\u201d apartment where it\u2019s basically completely separated. They have upstairs, I have downstairs. But sharing common spaces like kitchens and living rooms? Or even _bathrooms_? Noooooooope.", "I think that pales in comparison to bringing the friend to the house showing. He\u2019s literally trying to bully her into his decision. This is toxic AF.", "That's hardly a red flag in this economy", "And he resorted to name calling and cursing when he didn\u2019t get his way. OP is NTA and needs to rethink this whole relationship. Mature adults in loving relationships don\u2019t call each other names.", "No. Uh uh. We don\u2019t hear our people who insult us.", "i have a place with 3 bedrooms. my partner and i sleep in different rooms (i have disabilities). we have a spare room that is a guest room and the only people who have ever lived there have been my brothers in a pinch. it is rarely used these days. i keep it solely for one brother to visit and to use for emergencies. years ago one brother had to get out of a very bad situation (my partner and i did see it coming so prepared) and i got him out with 10 mins between getting the call and leaving the house.\n\ni recently had someone suggest i rent the room out to make money. i replied that the room was dedicated to giving my brother a sense of stability if he was on the verge of homelessness again. i live in an expensive area with lots of students and a rental/homelessness crisis so people can be judgy abut it. a while back someone even suggested my partner move into my room then we could provide housing for 2 people and because of this of course they should only have to pay a fraction of reasonable rent...oh and they had people in mind.", "Incorrect.  OP has set a boundary, and a perfectly reasonable one.  He's the one ignoring and attempting to stomp that boundary when he does NOT even need flatmates.  She is not allowing him to prioritize unneeded complications to their relationship.", "First let\u2019s clarify something: OP doesn\u2019t \u2018feel like\u2019 Adam insulted her\u2026Adam ACTUALLY insulted her.\n\nOP is 100% allowed to tell Adam that roommates are a non-negotiable dealbreaker for her. She heard him out and clarified her reasoning why that doesn\u2019t work for her. \n\nAdam is also allowed to say that subsidising his buddy\u2019s housing and having them live with Adam and OP is a non-negotiable requirement for Adam. That would make it no AHs and they would just be incompatible. \n\nBut Adam threw a fit and insulted OP\u2026he didn\u2019t insult her stance, he attacked OP as a person by calling her a spoiled brat and a selfish AH.  That definitely makes him an AH. \n\nThen Adam took it a step further by refusing to go to scheduled showings and when he deigned to show up to another showing, he brought his buddy. The one who wants OP to subsidise housing for him and his gf because they can\u2019t afford anything on their own. This shows that Adam isn\u2019t interested in respecting OP\u2019s boundaries and is perfectly willing to steamroll over her in any instance where they don\u2019t agree. \n\nAdam is clearly the AH in this scenario.", "Some people just talk that way, and it\u2019s acceptable to them. And if they\u2019re on the same page then more power to them, but for me? Nope. Calling me names (especially in anger) is unacceptable and I will not stand for it. I\u2019d probably give someone _one_ chance depending on the severity of what was said, giving them a \u201cno. You do not talk to me that way\u201d response. But if they kept doing it or just went really bad from the get go I\u2019d absolutely dump them for it", "That\u2019s my feeling too. He has already promised them a room in the new apartment.", "Then break up with the guy! That's fine! No one said OP has to marry him. His insults are definitely grievous, but it's also bad to expect him to stay with you and accept being overruled without being heard.", "My money is on OP having to pay for food and utilities too.", "I suspect this is more about the BF's commitmentphobia -- hard to push for marriage and kids when you're housesharing like you're 22. But also, yeah, I'd be worried about finances because if anything happens with the other couple or him, he's going to expect her to cover it because \"you can ask your parents\", hes teeing that up already.", "And if god forbid you need to rent out to help out; don't just charge rent to cover what expense they might cause. Charge them enough rent, utilities, and deposit to where you make a solid profit and is a definite benefit to you even if they end up screwing you.", "Down-low situations happen all over the place on the daily. Someone is the oblivious partner. \n\nCould be OP.", "She never said she expected him to stay. She took a stand on her needs and he\u2019s welcome to do whatever he wants to with that.", "Exactly.  They\u2019d bring it up if it wasn\u2019t a fucked up situation.", ">He said his friends can\u2019t afford to rent on their own and we would be doing them a favour.\n\nYou are not obligated to do this *fucking huge* favor for his friends. I wouldn\u2019t do it either. NTA.", "NTA.  Also he\u2019s never lived completely alone?  A red flag \ud83d\udea9 in that it often goes a certain way with people who have never had to fully rely on themselves.  \nI\u2019ll be awaiting updates on how it goes when you guys eventually move in together.", "NTA. Your boyfriend sounds codependent. His friend\u2019s housing situation is not his problem to address, and it certainly isn\u2019t yours.", "ESH.\n\nYou're both used to your own comfort. He's used to living with people, you're not. You clearly will not mesh well together in terms of living as things stand.\n\nSo at this point I'd advise you to have a serious talk with him, figure out where do you want to go and decide whether it's something you can do together.\n\nEither way, waiting until you're literally moving in together to bring up the fact you want to live with other people in the same house as your loved one does make him suck quite a bit more. I won't pay attention to the insults because we are getting a one-sided story after all.", "NTA for having a preference.\n\nYTA for how you expressed your preference.", "And if he wants to help out his friends who are struggling, just imagine what the rent situation would be.  They would not carry their weight and when OP wants to boot them it would be 3 against 1.  \n\nDo not move in with this guy.  Time to hit the brakes and get some time away from him and his ridiculous ideas.", "Yep. In fact, any time there would be a disagreement, it would be three against one.", "NTA - This was my thought also, who wants to give up their independence to move into a situation where every decision will be 3 against 1.It will cause OP to resent everything about her relationship, and possibly be stuck for the length of the lease.", "I know that friend was \u201chinting\u201d for themself. Also knew they\u2019d be a terrible roommate. Hard no.", "I have no \u2018empty spare room\u2019, no lounge/sofa and only a semi comfortable blow up mattress for precisely this reason. \n\nI like my own space and my own company and I bought my place for me. \n\nNo one has ever stayed longer than 2-3 nights and even that is a strain on my temper.", "I agree. Where I live I could easily make a quick Buck sharing my space. But I don\u2019t want too!\n\nI have one friend who has struggled and there is writing on the wall that her rent controlled building is going to get sold and torn down- I\u2019ve told her I would help her. But we have both lived alone for too long.", "The issue isn\u2019t that she isn\u2019t allowing him \u201cto prioritize unneeded complications\u201d.  She specifically says, \u201cI am not willing to sacrifice my lifestyle and comfort to share a house with other people.\u201d  This isn\u2019t a \u201ctheir relationship\u201d issue, this is an issue of she wants and doesn\u2019t care what he thinks.  She wasn\u2019t even willing to listen to him at first.  She didn\u2019t care; it wasn\u2019t how she felt or what she wanted so she wasn\u2019t going to listen.  He had to push the issue for her to even give it any real thought.  How she felt was the only thing that mattered.  Even now OP doesn\u2019t seem to care about what matters to him, only about whether or not she is TA.\nMaybe she\u2019s right, maybe she is \u201ctoo used to independence\u201d, and making a sacrifice for someone else is above her.  After all, a relationship requires relinquishing independence and building interdependence.  Maybe she is above that \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think this is it. He\u2019s trying to get some \u201cinsurance\u201d for when they inevitably break up. He doesn\u2019t want to get the boot", "I know it's a Reddit cliche to build a conspiracy out of nonexistent info but this situation just seems very weird to me.\n\nPart of me thinks OP is just a sugar Momma to her BF. It's just odd that this guy is full on set on having a place with this other couple because \"they need the help.\" I can just picture the convo to the guy. \"Yeah I really don't like her much. She makes good money though. I could probably convince her to go in on a place for all of us.\"", "i spent 10 year in shared accommodation. that was enough. if i did take in a renter it would be a nightmare since the smell of certain foods cooking make me vomit. my partner went from eating eggs daily and fish several times a week to going up the road to have his eggs and eating tinned fish in the backyard.\n\nwould be miserable for everyone.\n\nmy grandfather has two spare rooms (a block from a university) and people frequently try to move in, he also gets told he has to downsize. he's 91 and bought that house because he can stay there until he dies, he will not go into nursing care. had a relative a week ago say it was mean and his kid was having trouble finding a rental so he should move out. it's fucking insane what people will say. he uses every inch of his home, wouldn't even cope in a place of average size like mine, let alone a nursing home.\n\ni hope your friend finds a wonderful place soon and the dates line up so she doesn't get stuck", "I was wondering this too.", "Last time I checked, you didn\u2019t need to factor in the needs of two roommates to build a relationship. Does she need to be interdependent on them, too? I wouldn\u2019t live with a roommate either. Living arrangements aren\u2019t something she should have to compromise on.", "Nah man. Moving in with other people is a two yeses / one no situation. If you don\u2019t need the money, a relationship should move towards just the two of them, not the other way around. \n\nIf there was a really compelling reason, he would be pleading with her instead of calling her names.", "That's fine. That's great in fact, the part about taking a stand. If this is a dealbreaker it's a dealbreaker. Just don't use this script for people you want to stay in your life.", "I\u2019d bet the convo went somewhere along the lines of ;\n\n\u201cHey bro, I know you guys are looking for a place, think you can find one my and my gf can room with ya? We can\u2019t afford it on our own, but we\u2019ll pay what we can rooming?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah bro that shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. Very much a young persons way of thinking. Or at least someone not thinking of any of the actual details.", "He\u2019s 35 though, not exactly that young", "Which is concerning!", "And he\u2019s not an AH for dismissing OP\u2019s want to live alone??", "The next showing would have the friend AND his gf show up, making it 3 against 1...", "And those people are never going to leave... You'll be 55 and still living with all of them because now it's \"like you're family\"", "Ya I totally agree. When your partner says something is important to them responding with \"No were doing what's important to me\" without even thinking about it is wild to me. \n\nI couldn't date someone who communicates like that personally. Though I do think bringing the friends to the open house and the insults are even worse communication lol.", "And that is a huge red flag too. If your partner unilaterally makes big decisions like this with other people, and not communicating with you, it does not bode well for the relationship. \n\nOP you are NTA", "This. They\u2019re both legit lifestyle choices. Though the BF\u2019s name-calling of OP was assholeish.", ">Her boyfriend isn't mature, nor is he a safe partner to keep around considering how he's bullying her.\n\nI\u2019m surprised more people haven\u2019t commented on his name-calling. If that\u2019s a pattern, she should consider running, not walking, away from this.", "Exactly.", "Nah his communication is even worse. But I do agree she is the asshole for acting like her word is law without even thinking about it.", "And even if they move out, how long til the next friend needs help? \nNTA. Get your own place at least. He's never going to put you first. One day he'll.invite friends with kids in because they are struggling then you will end up babysitting because they deserve time off and struggling, cleaning up after them because they are tired and struggling etc \n\nJust no", "He wants his buddy to move in so they can hang out all the time. They will stop paying at some point. You shouldn't trust your boyfriend because he changed everything. You do not have to live with others if you don't want to.
