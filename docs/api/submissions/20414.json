There's absolutely nothing wrong or weird about not wanting to live with anyone other than your partner. It's an extremely common preference.

It's a red flag that they can't afford to rent on their own. They might not be able to make rent, or they might mooch off the groceries you pay for. Maybe you should just get your own place and let your boyfriend live with them. He is clearly not willing to live with just you right now and he shouldn't pressure you to share a house with them.", "NTA.\n\nI was going to say N-A-H, because neither of you are wrong for wanting or not wanting to share your space--it's just an incompatibility.\n\nBut then \"selfish brat.\" He can fuck all the way off for that.", "Look, at 35, there is absolutely no shame in sharing a flat or a house with somebody.

Some people don't understand how nice it is to not have to worry about catering to the schedule and activities of others in a shared space. Your bf is trying to help his friend out, but he's asking you to make a substantial sacrifice to do so.\n\nAlso, has your bf even considered how long this favor is supposed to last? Are they going to be roommates until you are 40? It sounds like your bf is the one who needs to think about it before jumping into that kind of scenario.", "NTA. When you agreed to move in together, it was under certain terms (which were completely reasonable). Now he wants to change the terms and still hold you to the agreement.", "NTA, but his apparent inability (or refusal) to live on his own should be a huge red flag for you.", "NTA\n\nif Lord Bountiful wants to help out his friends, then why not give them money directly so they can rent their own place?   I'm glad you're saying no to this and I don't blame you in the least.  \n\nEven if you knew these friends, it's a whole different bag of worms to live with another couple in a financially uneven situation (evictions aren't fun and freeloaders can get really pissy when you try to kick them out)\n\nSounds like you should just start house hunting on your own and let Mr Moneybags and his freeloaders sort themselves out.", "NTA - I totally get it.

You have every right to choose how you want to live your life. It\u2019s unfortunate that his friends are unable to afford to live without roommates but it is not your responsibility to to fill that role. BTW, Adam seems to have jumped around quite a bit, always living with someone. I would expect someone in their thirties to have the emotional bandwidth and financial means to be independent.

Yes, being able to afford your own place is definitely a privilege in this day and age. That being said, it\u2019s not wrong to want to exercise that privilege\u2014acknowledging you have something and having it anyway doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. You\u2019re not obliged to downgrade your comfort for someone else, especially since, sorry to say, but if they\u2019re still needing a flat share at nearly 40, there\u2019s probably no solid end date in sight.", "NTA. Good God, OP. He's not worth the trouble. Who could suggest something so stupid! Run", "couples sharing a house or a flat is not for everyone.  You don't it.  No is a complete sentence.\n\nYour BF is a not respecting your wishes.  \n\nNTA", "NTA.  More flatmates, more drama, and you will be miserable.  You know yourself and what your needs are; he\u2019s literally asking you to set yourself on fire to keep his friends warm.  Now that you know that he thinks you\u2019re a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d, do you really want to live with him, either?  It is clear his verbal abuse and attempts to manipulate you and destroy your boundaries are not going to stop.  Is this something you can tolerate long-term?", "NTA he's acting like a child who can't have his friends over. Are you sure you want to have a life with some one like this? If so you need to sit down and talk about why he's completely unreasonable. Also you might need couples counciling as I thing he needs to learn that \"no I don't want to\" is a complete and fair sentence to this situation", "NTA\nGood thing you've only been dating a year. A 35 year old man shouldn't want to have friends living in his home when he has a romantic partner there. Wouldn't that kill the vibe? Especially since y'all don't need the extra money to pay bills.\nIdk, that sort of thing is normal when you're a kid, or in your 20s and money is tight, but he doesn't fit those scenarios. \nSeems like he's codependent in regards to friends/family if he can't seem to handle not living with them. I don't think he's mature enough for you.", "NTA. I can even understand having such good friends you prefer to share even if you don't need it financially (been there, done that). But everyone should not just agree, but actively want it, or it won't work out. So your bf had to drop this after you've said no. \n\nBesides, the whole is just so super weird. I presume the friends aren't currently homeless, so they obviously are able to solve their housing problem independently. Or they are Adam's current flatmates and he's dragging them into his new relationship? Is the rent not a problem for each of you separately or just for you or you and Adam together, but not for Adam alone? Honestly, I get the vibes of him \"helping\" his friends with your money.\n\nOverall, it's not bad that Adam has friends he cares about so much. What is bad is that he doesn't care about his GF at all. Your relationship are less important for him then his friendship, and it's up to you to decide if this is your cup of tea. But you need to keep in mind that he'll never put you first if he doesn't now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
