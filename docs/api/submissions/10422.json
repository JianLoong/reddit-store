But but elders\n\nETA:  I think what makes it so hard for these elders not getting the \u201crespect\u201d they deserve (in their minds) is that the old cultural norms are fading.  The advent of internet and social media has changed the outlook of their younger generations.  Almost feel for their confusion at not being awarded the respect they gave their elders.  In the US you see many first generation immigrants breaking away from their parents cultures. Some are let go easily, others forced to marry because they couldn\u2019t stand yo to them.  Then divorce and parents lose their control. One post said that some cultures have kids to care for them in old age and it\u2019s not happening.

(You did get them separate rooms, right? If you shoved grandparents and uncle into one while enjoying a suite to yourself, yeah, you're going to cause bad feelings) I feel like it could have easily been smoothed out with some placating and spinning this in a complimentary way.

We thought you'd be more comfortable with a private space and not having everyone popping in and out!\"\n\nAlso, if it was going to be as big a deal as to ruin the entire trip, why did no one just go upgrade the room?
