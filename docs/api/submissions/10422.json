British English uses 'the elderly' but I don't think it has the same meaning or idea.\n\nThe idea of 'respect' should be universal but just because something happens to me as an old bloke doesn't mean people are being 'disrespectful'. If this is the only argument you have for the vicissitudes of life, you have no argument at all.\n\nTell them that if they wanted a suite, they were welcome to pay for it.

But but elders\n\nETA:  I think what makes it so hard for these elders not getting the \u201crespect\u201d they deserve (in their minds) is that the old cultural norms are fading.  The advent of internet and social media has changed the outlook of their younger generations.  Almost feel for their confusion at not being awarded the respect they gave their elders.  In the US you see many first generation immigrants breaking away from their parents cultures. Some are let go easily, others forced to marry because they couldn\u2019t stand yo to them.  Then divorce and parents lose their control. One post said that some cultures have kids to care for them in old age and it\u2019s not happening. It\u2019s hard for them but the younger ones need to stand firm.\n\nETA.  A Korean woman I was. Friendly with has 2 sons.  Ohhhb she said number one son he good boy.  He follow rules and he do right .  Buy #2 son, he bad. He no follow rules he does what wants.  So what you are telling me he is Americanized and she was boot happy.  I just said I suppose you came hoping for more opportunities  can come some bad.  I don\u2019t think he was bad  by our terms.
