I believed the picture was only a joke as the kid in the picture was very odd looking and it seemed like it was from the internet. Thinking it was a joke i replied \u201cLMAO your brother looks just like you, with his oversized nose\u201d when i got a reply my heart sank. Apparently her brother had died earlier this year, and i made fun of him without knowing. My friend still hasn\u2019t opened my message of me apologising and im hoping our friendship will last through this.

She probably didn\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s traumatic for her. You not knowing doesn\u2019t make what you said hurt less. Try to apologize and learn about her brother if she\u2019s willing to ever open up to you. If not, please let this be a lesson to be more careful about making jokes about things you don\u2019t know about. I lost my dad when I was a little younger than her and it was really hard for me to talk about it, so no one knew for a long time or until we were really close so I can relate to her in that aspect.", "YTA - unless you\u2019re being paid as an insult comic, don\u2019t comment on people\u2019s appearance, let\u2019s just start with that.

And, you sure as heck shouldn't made comments like that on what is clearly a very serious and personal post remembering a loved one that is gone to soon. Hopefully you will learn something from this and not repeat it in the future.", "If someone accidentally punches you in the face you still got punched in the face.
