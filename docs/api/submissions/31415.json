I don't know the right word) and he introduced his girlfriends(22f and 23f) to my wife(47f) and I yesterday. I'm so proud of my son because both of his girlfriends are pretty, and the first thing I did was have a beer(the legal age where I am is 19) with him. They had dinner with my family, and they went home. I was curious about the dynamics of a three person relationship. When my son lived at home, he lived with my ex(his mom), and, I admit, I wasn't there as much as I probably should have been. I regret it, but I'm proud of who he is now. Today, my stepson(21m) started complaining about how unfair life is because he can't keep a girlfriend and how hes still living at home, yet my son has 2 girlfriends and lives with them. He kept complaining and whining about how my son has everything figured out while he doesnt. I had enough. My stepson has always had this victim mentality. He's been in 3 relationships, and all three of them ended with him  cheating. He cheated on his first girlfriend with his second, his second with his third, and he tried to cheat on his third girlfriend with her cousin. He spends almost every day partying, and he hasn't been able to keep a job for more than a month at a time. I snapped. I told him that all of that was his fault and to stop blaming everyone else for his mistakes. That pissed him off, and he called me an asshole and left the room. My wife thinks I'm an asshole too.\n\nAITA for telling my stepson to stop blaming everyone else for his mistakes?\n\nETA: I've tried giving him advice before, and he always disregards me. He keeps complaining and complaining and doing nothing to fix it, and I snapped.", "created_utc": 1700533376, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18064z9/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_to_stop_blaming/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's cheated on two girlfriends and tried to cheat on a third?! He needed the tough love here. He absolutely is the only one to blame for being single, and he's acting like women are commodities. \n\n(Please don't communicate to your son that you're proud of him specifically for having two pretty girlfriends, though. That also treats women as possessions or trophies. )", "NTA for what you said to your step son but ewwwww, the comment about being proud of your son cause his 2 gf are pretty, that's creepy dude, don't ever say that to anyone else ever.", "YTA - you\u2019re proud of your son because his girlfriends are pretty? I hope this is a language barrier thing because being proud based on how good looking your kid\u2019s sexual partners are is quite a low bar.  Maybe your stepson feels that you treat him inferior to your son because to you, your son can do no wrong.  \n\nThis is such a weird post.", "NTA The stepson sounds tiresome. It's his own fault for having no respect for women, or himself by the sounds of things. Boy needs to grow up.", "NTA,\n\nThats what one would call (adult) parenting, not to be a shitty person and make good life choices and actions. Cheating is not one of them\n\nShame it hasnt happened enough in the past.", "NTA about the stepson thing but it\u2019s pretty weird that you\u2019re proud of your son bc his girlfriends are pretty and not because, say, they\u2019re smart, successful, kind, or because the triad is healthy. idk, i might assume from that, that maybe you being around played a part in shaping your stepson to be so misogynistic that he thinks he\u2019s entitled to a girlfriend after cheating on 3 of them and it seems he also thinks that getting a girlfriend will solve all his problems, which it will not and will only cause more problems for her since he doesn\u2019t have any of his shit together. in which case, your son probably has better game BECAUSE you weren\u2019t around much, so he has his mother\u2019s influence to thank. but thats neither here nor there and again, you\u2019re nta with the stepson thing regardless, but still, just an observation", "You\u2019re a pig.", "NTA. Your stepson clearly wants relationships to be spoon fed to him and doesn't want to put an effort to maintain his relationships. \n\nYour wife's reactions show that she was responsible for molly coddling him and is major cause for stepsons refusal to take responsibility. Now that you know both the losers habit, instead of helping your stepson, better learn to ignore or shut him up because he will not learn anything good from you nor improve himself.", "YTA. You're proud of him because the women are pretty? So nothing about their personalities and how they treat him, you're just focused on their looks? And seeing as how you weren't even there for your son when he was growing up, you're not really in the best position to be giving advice to your stepson.", "NTA", "NTA.", "Firstly, YTA. \nYou\u2019re proud of your son because he has two pretty girlfriends? Get tf out of here. \nSecondly, your step son wasn\u2019t blaming anyone. He seems to merely be complaining\u2026 about himself. He has no malice or hostility towards your son. He merely said it seemed like your son had it figured out. \n\nAlso\u2026 Something is wrong with you if that\u2019s something to be proud of regarding you son.", "NTA. The truth hurts", "NTA! A trio-relationship may not be an ideal scenario for most people but your step-son has absolutely no leg to stand on. \n\nHe has cheated 2 times and almost got a trifecta on the 3rd one but got caught. That's some serious character flaw. \n\nHe sounds immature and petty, someone who takes absolutely no accountability for his life or actions.\n\nYou were well within your rights to tell him, someone had to.", "NTA you spoke straight facts and nothing less", "NTA", "Nope. The truth hurts.", "YTA.  Being *right* doesn't absolve you from being an AH.  You're absolutely not wrong.  It's easy for you and me (and almost certainly his mom) to see that he's the problem.  The question is if how you want about things is going to cause change or make things worse.  I'm reasonably certain he's not going to go \"oh, shoot!  You're right!  I will change immediately!\"\n\nSo what's the right thing to do?  Show him a good example, give him every opportunity to make good decisions, if he has medical issues help him to get treatment, and when you choose to answer his questions honestly, do so with empathy and kindness.", "yta. It's tough love, but calling him out like that won't help. Lead by example, offer support, and be kind when giving advice.", "yta. being right doesn't excuse being a jerk. sure, he's got issues, but calling him out like that won't help. lead by example, offer support, and be kind when giving advice.", "yta. it's tough love, but approaching it with empathy and kindness would have been more effective in the long run.", "Yeah folks are really jumping on that latter part to call OP TA, but for the stepson portion there\u2019s nothing wrong with what OP did. Cheating THREE times? You deserve a harsh discussion about that, totally unacceptable to not recognize the faults in your ways.", "I think weird is an understatement.", "Could not agree more. What\u2019s sad about it is the \u201cdads\u201d post is about his steps sons lack of self awareness, which the dad appears to have an equal amount of.  \n\nNot only is it a low bar, it\u2019s also misogynistic. His step son is upset cause he can\u2019t keep a girl, as if they should put up with his bs. And the dad isn\u2019t proud of the women\u2019s achievements, drive, etc. he\u2019s proud he scored to pretty girls. \n\nThis is all gross", "I came here to say exactly the same. How weird that he is proud because the girls are pretty... disgusting behaviour", "If my son was hooking up with 2 pretty ladies, I would certainly feel like I had done something right as a father.\n\nStop being so uglynormative", "[removed]", "I've tried giving him advice and offering him support.
