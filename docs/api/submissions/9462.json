{"id": 9462, "submission_id": "10x0sqz", "title": "AITA For Changing My Mind and Not Allowing My Kid to Spend a Month With My Mom?", "selftext": "  \n\nI (34m) agreed a month ago to let my son (8m) spend four weeks with my mother (58f) in South Carolina this summer.\n\nMy son and I visited my mother recently. My mom lives 4 hours away. It\u2019s a different state, so not close, but not too far. Although I grew up religious (Evangelical Christian) I am no longer. I'm open about that fact with my family. My son is exploring the idea of religion, which is fine by me because I know it can bring comfort. My mother is very religious. She's had a rough life (much of her own making) and clings to religion like a lifeboat.\n\nDuring our visit, my mom invited my kid to church. Son said yes and I said ok. When my son came back I asked him what he learned in church that morning. My son said he learned he needed to protect himself \u201cfrom the evil people in the world\u201d. My mother clarified that the sermon was on guarding against doubt. I then asked my son \"who are the evil people?\". And then he said \"Evil people are people who don't believe.\"\n\nWell my mom was quick to jump in to say \"Wait, no no. That's not what they said.\" I don't know, but it was clear that's the message he received. I didn't say anything at the time because I didn't know what to say, but I was not happy thinking my kid was being taught that I and people like me are evil for not being Christian.\n\nA few days later I decided to rescind my approval to let my son spend a month with my mom this summer. I think it would be wrong of me to tell my mother she can't go to church while looking after my kid. She would either have to skip church for that whole month or leave my kid alone at her house for two or three hours each Sunday. My mother also has a track record of asking forgiveness rather than approval and not telling me things. She pretends I didn\u2019t say anything, she didn't understand, or that she forgot, or if those excuses don't work, say \"it's not a big deal.\" So I think she would take my kid to church even if I said no to it.\n\nI also justified my decision to rescind based on my mom's boyfriend. She's broken up with him multiple times now because of his anger issues. But she keeps going back to him. I don't want my kid around him without me. My mom won't stand up for herself around him. I know because my dad and stepdad were the same way and my mom's choices exposed me to a childhood filled with emotional abuse. I don\u2019t want that for my son.\n\nAnyway, now my kid is sad. My mother is telling me I made her cry, I'm taking away her grandkid, and she can't understand how I would do this to her.  Basically, she\u2019s calling me the AH. AITA?\n\nNote: Yes, my mom is welcome to stay at my house this summer. She's welcome any time.", "created_utc": 1675870549, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x0sqz/aita_for_changing_my_mind_and_not_allowing_my_kid/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But the church thing - can your mom do an online service for the month? Hire a sitter for Sunday? Just forego it? It's not forever, just a month and your mother needs to figure out what's more important.  I would impress if she tries to sneak it by and take him to church anyhow it's a deal-breaker and on her. As far as your son goes it's a good time to discuss that all religions are different and not everyone believes the same, then discuss what your family believes. I think a lot of people have a good idea of him doing a week with grandma and seeing how it goes. 8 is a little young for a full month anyhow, my grands can do 2 weeks and after that they miss home.", "NTA\n\nAnd.. I'm sure I'll be downvoted for this but, idc: I'm a Christian. I go to church as often as my disability allows. I doubt that the message your child received from the sermon was the way it was intended. I've never heard it espoused that way. However, I do know that there are \"Christians\" who have just... the most un-Christlike views on anyone who isn't Christian. So it's possible.\n\nI also have a child. They're 13 and currently agnostic, leaning toward atheist. I have the greatest respect for any parent, of whatever religion, allowing their child to explore and decide for themselves what they believe.\n\nI also believe that said exploration needs to be supervised, to an extent. Because whatever they are exploring, children do often take things out of context, or might be radicalized one way or the other, without *neutral* guidance.\n\nIt doesn't sound like your mother was supervising what your child took in at church. There should have been questions about whether your child understood what was being said, long before they arrived home. It's typically best to address *any* new experience with children that age right away. This would have been a convo at the church or in the car for me.\n\nI'm wondering if either of you took time to explain the difference between what your mother believes was said, and what your child took away from it... *to* your child?\n\nOr what your mother believes the message was? Even in context of your post, I read it as, like...: \"We need to guard ourselves against evil. Evil will try to put us in doubt.\" and then a lot about what doubt is, and how we should have faith in our beliefs, and then sometime later something about \"Non-believers will question things, because they don't have faith, they have doubt\" or something...\n\nWhich... even then, easy to see the meaning your child got from it! Even though that's not, in my experience, calling the people evil.\n\nANYWAY, not trying to preach, just saying, to *truly* allow your child to experiment and explore, you still have to interpret some things for them.\n\nAn example, from my own life, I had to explain to my child, after they'd read a book on Buddhism, *why* some people believe in these... well, things I don't believe in. \n\nWe had a long discussion which is mostly a bunch of questions. \"Honesty is an important value in any religion. But not all religions focus on/dictate such total honesty. Why do *you* think these principles are highlighted so much here? Why do you think some people follow this belief? Do you believe they are right or wrong on this point?\" \n\nThat sort of thing.\n\n>My son is exploring the idea of religion, which is fine by me because I know it can bring comfort.\n\n>Anyway, now my kid is sad. \n\nThis is the bit that prompted me to reply so in-depth. I'm not assuming you haven't, because I know... character limits and brevity are often the reason it's not mentioned, but...\n\n*Have* you had a sit down with your son, about this?\n\nBecause I can see from a kid's perspective, him sitting there like \"I said something I heard at church. Grandma said I heard it wrong. Now parents are mad, grandma is sad, and I can't go to grandma's anymore!\" being... pretty scary and confusing at his age.\n\nI don't think you're the AH whichever choice you make, and Grandma is a bit of an AH for trying to manipulate your emotions with the whole \"taking away my grandkid\" bit, but... I'm just checking in cause sometimes we forget the kids don't see the events the same way we do!\n\nAnyway, goodluck!", "NTA - you sound like a good dad!!", "I really hope you sit your son down and have a serious talk with him about religion and how different people/groups approach it. Go over Galileo and his contributions to science and the backlash he experienced from the church, if nothing else. It\u2019s a good example of what happens to people when the church refuses to bend. Point out that while solar centrism was correct, the church refused to believe that things weren\u2019t Earth centric and had any who claimed otherwise labeled as heretics.\n\nMany things are wonderful in moderation and with careful consideration, but we must acknowledge the mistakes and weaknesses of the past so that they do not repeat!\n\nGood luck, NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. Your mom is trying to guilt trip you. Don\u2019t doubt yourself. You made the right choice.", "NTA, literally one Sunday and they were filling your son's head with hate. Your mother will have your son in there every Sunday.", "Absolutely NTA.  All factors included - extremist religion, angry boyfriend, no respect for boundaries- your mother should not be trusted with your 8 year old alone.  That boyfriend situation alone would put a stop to it for me, the church thing is just hell no.  Invite your mom to visit instead.", "NTA.  You can offer your mother to come stay with you for a month?", "Nope, NTA.\n\nAlthough you say your child is exploring religion, what he took in from your Mom\u2019s church is the wrong message. There are good people in this world who either don\u2019t believe or they reside in a different religion. Neither of those traits make them evil.\n\nOn top of that, your mom has a tendency of allowing a toxic man in and out of her life. If she won\u2019t stand up for herself to that man, she won\u2019t do the same for her grandchild if her boyfriend decides to take his anger out on your child.", "So your child willingly went and enjoyed it so you stop it because you don't?", "ESH Her because she can't be trusted to not take him to church while he's there if you made that a condition for him coming. You for lying about your reason for not wanting him at her house. If it's the church thing, tell her it's the church thing. Why lie about it?\n\n(And no, I won't respond to anyone but the OP. You all have your opinions. You can state them. I have mine. I stated mine. Isn't life grand? :) )", "NTA, no question. It sounds like your son wouldn't be protected and would be turned against you (religion-wise) at an impressionable age. Your mom's hurt feelings are her own to deal with.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure that your mother will agree to anything that you want her to in order to get her way, but I also think you are right to believe that she will ignore your wishes and take your son to church anyway. You have already given her a chance and look how *that* went. I would focus less on your mother\u2019s feelings about this and more on your son\u2019s feelings because now this whole drama with her has resulted in him being upset, conflicted, and confused. I would be worried about how an entire month with your son would allow her to influence him. It does not sound like a stable or healthy environment for him. I think you have the right idea in having her visit you instead. With careful supervision.", "NTA - your kid said the intended message of the sermon without the adult human filter to speak around the bigoted stuff. This just sounds like your mother is trying to bring your kid into the church and you as well later on when your kid calls you an evil sinner for years because that's what he learned in church", "I think you should ask your son what he wants. Does he want to spend time with grandma? Does he want to go to church? He is old enough to decide. If a month is too long, give him 2 weeks. You should also consider letting him go to church where you live, if he is interested.", "NTA\n\nYou need to protect your son. Your mother\u2019s church is horrendous and her relationship with her partner is dangerous. Your child doesn\u2019t need a front row seat to either of those things.\n\nYou also need to talk to him about how Grandma is a bad judge of character. She can\u2019t stop herself from yo-yoing back to her crappy partner, and she can be a sneaky, tricky person by asking for forgiveness instead of permission. It\u2019s not airing dirty laundry, it\u2019s helping your son learn to trust his gut and be real about people. You\u2019ve taught him your mother is a safe person to know and love, but the reality is that she isn\u2019t. She belongs to a bigoted church and she\u2019s addicted to the drama of her abusive boyfriend. Even if she dumped him, she would find another man with anger and abuse issues because that\u2019s who she looks for in a partner.\n\nWatch Tangled with your son and talk about Mother Gothel. That\u2019s your mother.", "Of course your child shouldn't stay with her when her boyfriend has anger issues, and for a whole month? Not sure why you would have ever agreed to that but of course it's good you have said no. Your kid may be upset with you but you just have to deal with that."]}
