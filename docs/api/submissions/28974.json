They made the same offer to my brother but he turned them down. I was curious to hear what they had to say so met up with them. I hadn't seen them since I was 11ish. I'm now 22. We met up and they told me that my half siblings had ended up in the care of one of my aunts last year after having a shitty time in foster care.\n\nThe background is my mom cheated on my dad during their marriage. She got pregnant after me and thought the baby was his, until she was 7 months pregnant. They broke up and she moved in with the other man. My brother and I were young at the time but not so young that we couldn't put things together. My mom ended up having two kids with the other man. He died suddenly when the kids were babies. Mom died when I was 11. She died from an asthma attack. \n\nThe kids paternal family wanted nothing to do with them and refused to take custody. My aunts were my mom's only family and they both had young families at the time and did not feel like they could take on two additional children who were so young. My dad was also asked and he didn't take them either. So the kids went into foster care. Apparently they were never adopted and did not end up with good families. My brother and I never saw them after mom died and we didn't see our aunts afterward either because they were so mad at our dad that things became too toxic.\n\nMy brother and I never resented/blamed/hated our dad for not taking our half siblings. Heck, we didn't even really miss seeing them. We didn't bond with them while mom was alive and we weren't even that close to mom after the affair and her moving in with the other man.\n\nMy aunts have hated my dad all these years for not stepping up and keeping the four of us together and giving the kids a loving home. They said they couldn't do it and they hated that, but pointed out that our dad had money, he had the space in his home, and he could have, but he wanted to punish kids for our mom's actions. They said it was evil what he did. They were really intense about their hatred of him and made it clear they were reaching out because they thought my brother and I would hate him too and would be part of the family with our half siblings. Not being interested in that and not liking how they talked about my dad, I told them they should stop taking their guilt out on my dad and they should accept that my dad was the last person who had any obligation to the kids.\n\nMy aunts were like how could you say that over your poor little siblings and didn't I hate what happened to them and didn't I miss them and wish I'd had them in my life. They asked how I could say he had no obligation when he was mine and my brother's dad and he was the reason we were separated from our two younger siblings. I left and they texted me after saying the same stuff and saying how awful it was that I had that attitude.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697389242, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178jrhr/aita_for_telling_my_maternal_aunts_that_they/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I think I could be wrong for what I said, and TA in this interaction, is because I rushed to defend my dad but never really said how sucky it was for my half siblings. I also probably added to any guilt my aunts feel after learning what happened to their youngest niblings when they had too much on their plates to help them back then.

Seriously. Why do your aunts feel that your father should have any obligation to his ex wife's spawn?   \nHe has no connection to them and no obligation towards them.

While it is heartbreaking what happened to your half siblings, it's not your father's job to raise them.

Those kids fell through the cracks because the first, second, third, right on down to the 50th person who **should** have stepped in, didn't. Your aunts are vastly more to blame than your father ever could be.\n\nWould it have been a charitable act? Sure. However, charity is and should be voluntary. Him having \"money and space\" does not equal a moral obligation just because two women who didn't want to take the financial burden opted not to. They probably could have found a way, and they know it.\n\nIt's also really fuckin disgusting that they only contacted you so they could commiserate on how much they hate your father, and think he's evil. What was even the point of this? Did they think it was entirely him poisoning you? Did they think they were saving you? What absolutely wretched women.", "Right? Like yeah, there are some people who take the kids in and raise them if the alternative is foster care. But not everyone could do that. Some people would not be able to provide those kids with a happy home and to pressure them or lay that responsibility to do so on someone who has no relationship to the kids is so wrong. Why not go after their paternal side with such force? It's shitty to me.", "Furthermore, how could the father realistically be expected to care and raise two children who are literally a reminder of his ex-wife's infidelity? I'd expect he'd resent the hell out of those kids and would struggle at best to be a decent caregiver.", "I think they wanted us to turn on dad and get to know our half siblings and be part of things.", "They feel he had an obligation because he's mine and my brother's father AND because of the money he has. They feel it should have been easy for him and something good he should have done.", "Yeah, I don't get this at all\n\nThey just expected your dad to take in two kids that weren't his because..?\n\nI mean, yeah, it would have kept you and your step-siblings together\n\nBut your dad had zero obligation towards those kids \n\nThe paternal family of those kids though?  They DID have an obligation and said no, and that's okay with your aunts?\n\nWhy?\n\nI think this is moreso about the fact that your aunts recent your dad for not staying with your mom, than it is about those kids, tbh", "If that was their goal for how they wanted you to respond, they may have had a deeper reason for why they wanted that... guilt.\n\nThey may want to make it sound like your dad was the one that let your half-siblings go to foster care. But they also chose to not take those kids in.\n\nIf they could get you and/or your brother to turn on your dad, it could help them to feel better about their choice to not take the kids in. Especially if they got you two to start spending time with them (your aunts) in the process. They could tell themselves that if you doing these things means they were right all along.\n\nThey wouldn't be right, but it is one way some people try to justify their poor choices and actions. Get others to side with them.", "Your aunts aren't that smart, are they?", "Yeah. He's your father. Not theirs. Do you really think he would have treated them well, all things considered? They would've gotten the basic necessities, and not much else. If anything, they'd be looked at as a burden and not family, and he'd be right. They're not his family, even if they're related to you. Your aunts are delusional.", "It could also be that dad has money. He has always been financially stable and in theory yeah, he would have had no financial issues if he took them in or the fact he didn't offer them money so they could take them or something. Maybe even anger that he never gave mom any money she wanted. I know mom had asked him for money after the divorce. Not for us. Just for stuff in general.", "Nope. It's not like my brother and I were so close to them either that they would have had us even if our dad wasn't doing much other than feeding them. I'm not saying that wouldn't have been better than some of the stuff that happened. But it wouldn't have been good either. It's likely it would have been psychologically very hard to be in a home where they weren't loved but saw dad love on us and us love on dad."]}
