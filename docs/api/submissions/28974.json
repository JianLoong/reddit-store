They made the same offer to my brother but he turned them down. I was curious to hear what they had to say so met up with them. I hadn't seen them since I was 11ish. I'm now 22. We met up and they told me that my half siblings had ended up in the care of one of my aunts last year after having a shitty time in foster care.\n\nThe background is my mom cheated on my dad during their marriage. She got pregnant after me and thought the baby was his, until she was 7 months pregnant. They broke up and she moved in with the other man. My brother and I were young at the time but not so young that we couldn't put things together. My mom ended up having two kids with the other man. He died suddenly when the kids were babies. Mom died when I was 11. She died from an asthma attack. \n\nThe kids paternal family wanted nothing to do with them and refused to take custody. My aunts were my mom's only family and they both had young families at the time and did not feel like they could take on two additional children who were so young. My dad was also asked and he didn't take them either. So the kids went into foster care. Apparently they were never adopted and did not end up with good families. My brother and I never saw them after mom died and we didn't see our aunts afterward either because they were so mad at our dad that things became too toxic.\n\nMy brother and I never resented/blamed/hated our dad for not taking our half siblings. Heck, we didn't even really miss seeing them. We didn't bond with them while mom was alive and we weren't even that close to mom after the affair and her moving in with the other man.\n\nMy aunts have hated my dad all these years for not stepping up and keeping the four of us together and giving the kids a loving home. They said they couldn't do it and they hated that, but pointed out that our dad had money, he had the space in his home, and he could have, but he wanted to punish kids for our mom's actions. They said it was evil what he did. They were really intense about their hatred of him and made it clear they were reaching out because they thought my brother and I would hate him too and would be part of the family with our half siblings. Not being interested in that and not liking how they talked about my dad, I told them they should stop taking their guilt out on my dad and they should accept that my dad was the last person who had any obligation to the kids.\n\nMy aunts were like how could you say that over your poor little siblings and didn't I hate what happened to them and didn't I miss them and wish I'd had them in my life. They asked how I could say he had no obligation when he was mine and my brother's dad and he was the reason we were separated from our two younger siblings.

I'm not saying that wouldn't have been better than some of the stuff that happened. But it wouldn't have been good either.

None of _them_ are OP's father's responsibility either.", "To decline to take care of kids that are not yours is not at all the same thing as punishing them.\n\nThe aunts are displacing their own guilt onto OP's dad.", "I agree, mostly. \n\nThere was an obligation from the dad though, it was less than that from the aunts, less than that from the young children's father and his family, but they're was an obligation. He was obliged to care for his children, and the best way would be to ensure the step- siblings are cared for. That doesn't necessarily mean take them in as his children but he could have tried to figure something out. The aunts could have tried too.\n\nIt sounds like all the adults, plus whatever other family from the father of the babies were around, dropped the ball here. It's a shame because there was money and I'm sure they're was manpower to care for so the kids, but no one stepped up to coordinate.", "They could've become foster patents snd gotten paid", "Maybe they made too much to qualify.", "They're not OPs dads obligation. Raising 2 kids as a single parent is hard enough, even if your financially stable and you expect him to raise 4? It would also be a painful constant reminder to him of the affair and the fact that his biological children were pretty much tossed to the side for the moms new family.\n\nI feel for those kids, it sucks that they're in that situation, but it's not the dads responsibility.", "They need to alleviate their guilt and Dad is the only other adult around. They are those kids family, not OPs dad. They've probably been reached out to again and are going to say no again. None of that is OP or dad's problem.", ">But not everyone could do that.\n\nIf someone could take in these kids is one aspect. Another aspect is, if someone wants to take them.\n\nYes, your dad had the funds and the place, so he could take them. But clearly, he didn't want to. They're not his kids. They're the kids from your mom's affair. Maybe, your dad was really much hurt by the fact, his wife cheated on him. So, chances are, he has strong feelings against these kids. So, even if he would take them, they probably wouldn't have a good relationship with him, no home, where they're loved.\n\nWhy can't your aunts understand this?", "You're absolutely right. The paternal family should have stepped up or even your aunts themselves. My guess is that the reason they wanted your dad to take them so much was because \"your dad has money\". \n\nAnyway, NTA.", "Everything you said and more \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n\nYour aunts should go after the kids\u2019 paternal family. It\u2019s not ok they thought your father, who has no relation to those kids, should have anything to do with them. It\u2019s actually quite sick of them. It\u2019s like they were ok with your mom cheating and breaking up the family. Where were they and their big mouths when that happened?!!\n\nNTA OP. Keep defending your dad. Good for you!", "You're wiser than your aunts, OP. They've spent a decade avoiding guilt at all costs, don't let them lay it at the foot of those who weren't wrong for saying no.", "Right, you'd think she'd have named a guardian for the two kids she had custody of once her partner died. Also I am very unclear how OP's dad would even be allowed to take those kids in even if he'd wanted, he is not related to them in any way, he'd literally be a foster parent. You can't just give children to whomever you want, that's not how anything works. NTA", "I disagree here\n\nI don't think he was obligated at all\n\nThose kids were the product of his wife's affair \n\nI mean, sure, his kids lived with them 50% of the time (I'm assuming, based off of usual custody splits)\n\nBut it's still not his obligation \n\nWould it have been a nice thing to do?  Yes\n\nObligation?  No", "I don't understand why you think the dad has any obligations to the other kids whatsoever.", "He had no obligation to them just because they were his children's half-siblings.", "The kids are not his responsibility by any means. He divorced already whe she had them. They were not related at all to him.", "Yup", "Then they shouldn\u2019t have put the kids in foster care.", "Plus raising four kids on his own and dealing with that. Plus dealing with his kids grieving the loss of their mother.", "Or convince your dad to at least fund their care.", "But why 11 years later? What has changed in 11 years?", "Personally, I think money might have been a motivating factor", "He had no obligation.", "Sounds like they're a couple of aunts-with-a-c, so to speak.", "> They just expected your dad to take in two kids that weren't his because..?\n\nNot even two strange kids, the children of his wife's affair partner.", "These hypocritical aunts had just as much obligation as the paternal side of those kids to take them in. They just want to blame OP\u2019s dad bc they know they should have taken these kids in and they refused. Easier to blame someone else than to point the finger at themselves.", "The aunts had a sister who married well and had a couple of kids. Then she blew it by having an affair and getting pregnant. She got involved with her new family and let her relationship with her first set of kids fall by the wayside.\n\nThen she and the new guy both died and left behind a couple of young kids. Both their dad's side of the family and their mom's side (the aunts) refused to take them.\n\nYeah, the aunts are pissed that their sister blew off a good situation and they want to pretend that that relationship didn't get blown to bits by her.", "I do wonder what the story is with that other family", "Dad isn\u2019t the only other adult around, Dad is the only adult around, other than OP, of course.", "I can see that point. I think we all have an obligation to help children, be they related to is our not. But I understand not everyone thinks community before self so I get it.", "Because I think community is important. Because I think family is important, even if it's not family directly related to me. The children were all related, and the father is related to (some) of the children directly.\n\nI get why people don't think community is important. I disagree, but society has told us we should be \"rugged individuals\"", "Sure, if we discount obligations we have to family that isn't directly related to us, or even the the community at large, then he had none.", "Are they related to his kids?\n\nSo are you saying my BIL's parents aren't my family? Even though they are my niece's grandparents?\n\nWhy are people's idea of family so narrow?", "Quite honestly, I feel like there's much more information here than is being given.", "very delulu i think.", "One of the aunts recently took in the kids (they were in foster care before that).\n\nLast sentence of first paragraph in OP:\n\n>We met up and they told me that my half siblings had ended up in the care of one of my aunts last year after having a shitty time in foster care.", "Your mom had balls to ask your dad to help support her and her kids after divorce.", "Assuming your dad never remarried, I imagine it would be hard to raise 2 kids as a single dad, but 4?  And knowing those kids were the result of your wife stabbing you in the back?  I don't think it would be fair for him or those kids to be put in an emotionally difficult situation where their caretaker might unintentionally feel resentment or hurt while trying to care for them.", "Kids don't just need money, they need love and support. Your dad would have to be some kind of saint to offer that to two kids who were living reminders that his wife cheated on him and left. It's absolutely insane to even contemplate asking him to do it. You can know logically that it's not the kid's fault but still, he's only a human being. \n\nIt's sad that your half siblings didn't get a good outcome from the care system, but you don't have to be sad about it. And it's not your Dad's fault", "NTA.  I'd lose their numbers.  Your aunt's can only blame themselves.  It wasn't about the money.  They could have taken those kids.  The kids get Social Security Death Benefits and the state pays for foster care.  They just didn't want to be inconvenienced.", "Sure your dad could have supported them. Was it his responsibility? No. And seriously, why do people never think about the consequences of growing up in a family that resents them. That can be super damaging to kids as well. The thought of thinking hey you should raise the kids of your ex-wife and her former affair partner is just kind of insane to me.", "That's just a recipe for disaster", "Yuuup exactly", "Personally I believe that the dad taking the kids would be a very bad idea considering they represent his exwife's infidelity.", "First, they aren't his family and secondly there is no obligation that he go above and beyond in adopting them 'for the community'. The only ones with any type of obligation would be the mother's or father's relatives such as the Aunts. Even then I don't blame them for not adopting at that point due to their own situation at the time.\n\nThe kids were dealt a bad hand in life but that's just how the world goes sometimes.", "The husband's kids from previous marriage are family by marriage. They are step niece. In the event of divorce, they are actually not related. OP BIL has no obligation whatsoever toward the kids from previous marriage.\n\n OP daughter is BIL's niece for she is his wife's niece. His wife is blood related to OP daughter. Even if they got divorced, the wife is still related to the daughter.\nHe also has no obligation toward OP daughter but chose to do so out of his kindness to help OP who was a single mother \n\nTo ask the BIL to pay for the step niece education is just ridiculous.", "Let's face it, they choose NOT to care for their sister's children, their own biologically related nieces and nephews. They are trying to **relieve their guilt** by blaming your father, who had no emotional, biological, or legal reason to care for his ex-wife's children by another man.", "And I definitely think the aunts would be singing a different tune if the roles were switched and their sister (OP's mom) was the one who was cheated on."]}
