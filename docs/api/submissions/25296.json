I can think of two things in response.\n\nFirst, when he calls himself a traditional masculine husband, is he doing it to needle you or to brag himself up? Does it chip away at your sense of femininity or self worth when he says it?  If it does, then the proper response is to tell him so, not respond in kind. \n\nSecond, it's  irrelevant that he makes crap comments. Your actions are your actions, not his. When you make an A comment, it doesn't matter that you did it after him instead of before. You still did it. Now it's two people being TA", "It is absolutely hypocritical, but that doesn't change the fact that your husband feels inadequate as a \"provider\" and making these comments is not a helpful solution. Would you be able to honestly say to your husband \"I love you the way you are and I am happy with you. I don't need a traditional man to provide for me, I am happy with a partner that shares our burdens?\" If so, he has a little holdover of old fashioned ideas and you need to talk through them. If not, if you are resentful that you are working three jobs, he is probably picking up on that, and you need to talk with him about it. The key is that you should talk with him about why he feels the need to harp on the \"traditional masculine\" thing.", "Nuance and perspective \n\nI get out in the world and engage with a ton of people.

Best to you!", "He might also low-key be fishing for compliments because I bet his self-esteem is a little bit low watching you bust your ass so much while he\u2019s struggling to find better work.

Part of this issue though is that because he grew up privileged reality sometimes doesn\u2019t set in with money. So he doesn\u2019t want me to get the other job and wants to just wait until he gets a better paying one. However that could be next week or next year, and in the mean time we\u2019re barely scraping by. As someone who grew up very poor I prefer to just go out and work, even if I work myself into the ground, because I know how much it sucks not having any money and constantly stressing about it.\n\nWe do talk pretty openly about money, it\u2019s mainly that he thinks just waiting is the best solution.

OPs comments are harsh and uncalled for, but I 100% see the frustration in her husband branding himself as such while she is working more to help them. \n\nSounds like husband and wife need to have a sit down about why both of them feel the need to make those comments. He very well may be making them because he doesn\u2019t like OP working so much and bringing in more income than him. Both their egos are clashing.", "Okay, yeah fair enough. Part of me does think the comments are made more for his own benefit than towards me, and I\u2019m just quick to react", "Yes definitely. We have spoken about money etc and we do regularly and I have said that I\u2019d love to be in a situation where one day I don\u2019t HAVE to work and I can do it for pleasure. I mean who doesn\u2019t? But I personally think because he comes from a privileged background, not having money is effecting him more. I\u2019m very proud of my career and he\u2019s always known I don\u2019t want or need a \u201cprovider\u201d it\u2019s sort of something he\u2019s just decided. I feel like these old fashioned ideas are so engrained sometimes because his parents were similar, and their very systemic ideas", "We both earn more than the average income where we\u2019re from (which isn\u2019t even that much) however we both rent, have 2 cars, have debts etc. so I would say for our age we earn pretty good amount, it\u2019s just that we should actually be earning far more for what we do, and the cost of living crisis as well as multiple bad lucks means we\u2019re struggling. So having to suddenly move, multiple car issues etc. I haven\u2019t gone in holiday in 6 years, we don\u2019t have fancy or new cars, or live in a very nice place.

Part of me also feels like that is unfair, why am I feeling guilty for trying to make enough for us to survive. \n\nI definitely do think the comments are coming from an insecurity and I\u2019m just adding to it with my replies", "I mean if the things your husband says are so horrible that you feel the need to dunk on him like that then sure.\n\nIf anything, it is clear that you have a problem with your current situation and feel like your husband is not measuring up to what he thinks he is so you pop his bubble any chance you get. Tough spot to be in but some straight forward communication is better than \"clapping back\" at remarks by your partner that were not meant to be offensive. You're only breeding more resentment on top of that which already exists. It's clearly not good.", "It sounds like he feels like less of a man (something he's not used to feeling) and is kind of reaching out for reassurance, maybe? He doesn't come from a background of \"just do it,\" so he wants things to be easier but no clue how to go about it, and he's seeking validation from you instead of asking HOW to help. \n\nI'm like you, I've done the multi jobs. I actually work WITH my husband. It used to be sort of as his assistant, but now I'm an equal level and still assist. I got a second job for space, and we needed the money. My choice, he didn't want me. I absolutely resented him for it anyway. I didn't mean to, but it is HARD to work your ass off like that and not be resentful of a partner if they aren't pulling their weight in other areas. \n\nI made him go to therapy with me. Helped us tremendously.", "It honestly sounds like you are taking pot shots at each other. Rather than trying to undermine what he's saying because it's wrong try talking to him about why it bothers you and why you think it's wrong. This may be tough in the short term but long-term hopefully it will create a stronger bond.", "Oh I assure you there\u2019s a market for Peggy hill feet lmao and you seem like you have a great sense of humor so that\u2019s gotta count for something too", "Borderline NAH.

If he's being demeaning too, well he should knock it off too.", "I can see how that can come across, but it\u2019s actually the other way around. I don\u2019t expect that from him, I don\u2019t need him to measure up to anything. He\u2019s the one that has put these traditional standards into his head.

That sure is something happy people do. And ofc it's healthy for your relationship cos who doesn't like getting dunked on. If you have a problem with him calling himself masculine then talk to him about it. If he is wrong and you like a feminine man then tell him about it. You ignore all other aspects of masculinity and immediately jab at him in the areas of traditionality in which he is lacking. To me YTA. You may have some feelings that you're not acknowledging and to me it seems like it is resentment over the work you have to do. Stop sabotaging your own relationship and actually explore your own feelings and communicate with your husband instead of dunking on him for temporary feelings of high. Are you in this together or are you enemies? Jesus Christ.", "Some people find it hard to communicate, and they share little nuggets hoping to prompt a conversation. His comment about other women may be because someone - at work maybe - is softening him up and seeding the doubts. What about saying, \"Tell me more.\" Then, sit and listen.

Everybody wants to be an \u201calpha\u201d until it\u2019s time to actually hunt. I think the traditional marriage is a farce and inefficient way of living in this day and age. A working wife who\u2019s willing to get out there and bust ass is what a man really needs because at least you know if something happens to you, she can take care of herself.

I don\u2019t have to be an alpha to take care of business.", "I'm not ready to say YTA but I think you are misreading the situation. I think your husband actually feels bad about himself and needs reassurance.  And instead you basically do the opposite.
