{"id": 20597, "submission_id": "14j1hhr", "title": "AITA for having my SIL and her two kids escorted away by security because she refused to RSVP?", "selftext": "Last week was our daughter's 16th birthday. We decided to go all out on her party for a variety of reasons. This would include a private tour of a place she's wanted to go to and we rented out a room to have a catered dinner. This should all have been just a smooth ride, Right? Enter my SIL.\n\nMy wife and her sister do not get along. They can keep up a causal relationship for the sake of family but that's it. It doesn't help that my experiences with my SIL have been incredibly dramatic. She's quick to play the victim and gaslight. SIL has two daughters who are practically best friends with my daughter. So obviously she wanted to invite them. \n\nOne big issue with SIL and her family is that when it comes to coordinating anything with them, they are unreliable on a good day and like trying to communicate with a blind deaf person who does not speak the same language as you on a bad one. They are never on time, sometimes hours (or in one case a day) late, and will not communicate at all if they are planning to show up. The thing I hate the most is that she will just text you randomly after an event started saying they decided not to come, or show up when they said they said they can't make it.\n\nBecause my wife does not get along with her, I told her I would handle it. I sent two emails, and three texts, and had a 20-minute phone call with SIL months ago telling her what we were doing for my daughter's birthday. Because of what we were planning, we needed to buy tickets for everyone and tell the caterers how many they were serving. I needed an RSVP as soon as humanly possible to organize this stuff. She either needed to be on time or tell me she could not make it. I told her if she ghosts me, there will be no tickets for her and her kids. \n\nShe ghosted me. I didn't buy her and her kid's tickets.\n\nSIL and her kids showed up (on time somehow) for the event. \n\nMy wife was livid, so I handled the situation on my own and told my SIL and her kids they need to leave because we did not get tickets for her. If she wanted to join us for the tour it would cost quite a bit to get new tickets, and the caterers do not allow alterations after a certain amount of time out from the event. At first, she tried to say she did RSVP with me, and then eventually started to shame me. Our guide called security and in the end, she and her daughters were escorted away.\n\nThe event was great, but my SIL's entire family has blown up at me and my wife. The event was 2 hours away from SIL's home and they say it was heartless of me to turn her away after the trip. Along with this, her daughters have now stopped talking to my daughter. Telling her that I kicked them out of her party. I explained to my daughter the situation and she called me a dick. My wife has told me to ignore her family and that daughter will realize we're not in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1687737531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14j1hhr/aita_for_having_my_sil_and_her_two_kids_escorted/", "score": 2088, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Once doing so, it would be reasonable to only take that RSVP from SIL, herself, and not because \u2018daughter said cousin said SIL said\u2019 they would be there.", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences.

It\u2019s honestly her choice to seek blame in the situation in the first place. I can understand the hurt of learning my loved ones were escorted from my birthday party; however, I\u2019d want to know what happened instead of looking for someone to be upset with.

The important relationship at risk here is your daughter and her cousins. You aren't in the wrong here as there really wasn't much you could have done. There wasn't food for them, there weren't tickets for them. The venue wouldn't have accomodated them even if you wanted to. I think that's the part that's important for your daughter to understand: even if you had tried to welcome your sister-in-law and her kids with open arms, the venue would have sent them away.

I\u2019m sure D would have said to her cousins that her parents need to know and that their mom had to let them know, that they weren\u2019t taking the cousins word for it. \n\nOr call the SIL the night before final numbers had to be in and just ask.

Which he hasn\u2019t answered.\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole for not getting them tickets. I do think he upset his daughter at her birthday.

That sounds like involving her in a sneaky way which I\u2019m sure would\u2019ve caused more problems if the SIL is already willing to ignore a request for an RSVP and show up anyway.

My parents threw me a sweet 16 and I fully understood at that age what RSVP meant, and shut down any last minute stragglers.

All it would take is for SIL to say you left out her RSVP in the \u2018proof\u2019 and OP would be back to seeming like the AH to SIL\u2019s family. \nYou can\u2019t \u2018prove\u2019 she didn\u2019t RSVP.", "To keep the peace for his daughters birthday? To not ruin the friendship between their daughters? You saved some money but you wrecked the family, I don\u2019t think that was a good deal \ud83d\udc80", "\u201cThat\u2019s not how the world works\u201d \n\nActually it is. That\u2019s the common sense approach. Expecting flaky people to stop being flaky because it\u2019s an occasion you care about is illogical. It\u2019s really dense asf.", "I'd state my case. Then move on - no more mental energy on the matter.", "Can't imagine they need proof as it'd be pretty surprising if the rest of the family aren't aware of SIL's behaviour. They choose to believe her, needing proof is irrelevant.", "He can prove he asked repeatedly for an RSVP. SIL would then have to prove that she did RSVP.", "I assume they where told by their mother that they were kicked out for no reason.", "Honestly, idk how good of an idea it is to rely on 15/16 year olds to convey such important information.", "Which perpetuates the attention on her, she gets to be the center of the drama and all eyes are on her. Giving her exactly what she wants. \n\nBest off just dropping it and not feeding into her ego.", "All of that is shitty behavior. If you have a good reason for being late thats all fine. Happens to all of us. But if its a pattern you just dont care and I have a right to be pissed because my time is not less valuable then yours.", "In this case, it seems like it couldn't be worse than just talking to the SIL. I think hitting it from both fronts, parents to SIL and daughter to cousins, would've given slightly better odds (assuming the cousins realize their mom's problem)", "its a 16 year old, not a 6 year old, they're reliable, especially if it's something they'd care about like a big birthday party with their best friends", "This is kind of the point, though. The party was for her. Hand it over to the daughter to deal with, get her involved in the decision making. Because this is how she learns on the importance of such things. As it stands, the whole thing was a mess, and nobody has learned anything.\n\nOP could have even explained to the daughter - \"I need confirmation from your cousins and aunt within the next 3 days, or the special birthday celebration for your 16th will not include them. Can you get them to commit to it? Make it clear - if they say they are coming, they have to come, and if they can't say they are coming, then they aren't coming.\" That way, the daughter shares the frustration and makes the call herself. It's basically about her party. As it stands, the whole argument is between SIL and OP, when it should be about the daughter if it's her birthday.", "I grew up brutalized by my dad. My siblings and mom were, too. Thanks for not being a POS, it\u2019s heartening to see different parental approaches that don\u2019t result in the need for years of trauma therapy", "You can\u2019t say that here\u2026", "Yep your \u2018fine\u2019 is called Stockholm syndrome."]}
