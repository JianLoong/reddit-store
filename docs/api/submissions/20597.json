{"id": 20597, "submission_id": "14j1hhr", "title": "AITA for having my SIL and her two kids escorted away by security because she refused to RSVP?", "selftext": "Last week was our daughter's 16th birthday. We decided to go all out on her party for a variety of reasons. This would include a private tour of a place she's wanted to go to and we rented out a room to have a catered dinner. This should all have been just a smooth ride, Right? Enter my SIL.\n\nMy wife and her sister do not get along. They can keep up a causal relationship for the sake of family but that's it. It doesn't help that my experiences with my SIL have been incredibly dramatic. She's quick to play the victim and gaslight. SIL has two daughters who are practically best friends with my daughter. So obviously she wanted to invite them. \n\nOne big issue with SIL and her family is that when it comes to coordinating anything with them, they are unreliable on a good day and like trying to communicate with a blind deaf person who does not speak the same language as you on a bad one. They are never on time, sometimes hours (or in one case a day) late, and will not communicate at all if they are planning to show up. The thing I hate the most is that she will just text you randomly after an event started saying they decided not to come, or show up when they said they said they can't make it.\n\nBecause my wife does not get along with her, I told her I would handle it. I sent two emails, and three texts, and had a 20-minute phone call with SIL months ago telling her what we were doing for my daughter's birthday. Because of what we were planning, we needed to buy tickets for everyone and tell the caterers how many they were serving. I needed an RSVP as soon as humanly possible to organize this stuff. She either needed to be on time or tell me she could not make it. I told her if she ghosts me, there will be no tickets for her and her kids. \n\nShe ghosted me. I didn't buy her and her kid's tickets.\n\nSIL and her kids showed up (on time somehow) for the event. \n\nMy wife was livid, so I handled the situation on my own and told my SIL and her kids they need to leave because we did not get tickets for her. If she wanted to join us for the tour it would cost quite a bit to get new tickets, and the caterers do not allow alterations after a certain amount of time out from the event. At first, she tried to say she did RSVP with me, and then eventually started to shame me. Our guide called security and in the end, she and her daughters were escorted away.\n\nThe event was great, but my SIL's entire family has blown up at me and my wife. The event was 2 hours away from SIL's home and they say it was heartless of me to turn her away after the trip. Along with this, her daughters have now stopped talking to my daughter. Telling her that I kicked them out of her party. I explained to my daughter the situation and she called me a dick. My wife has told me to ignore her family and that daughter will realize we're not in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1687737531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14j1hhr/aita_for_having_my_sil_and_her_two_kids_escorted/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Turning away my SIL and her kids from my daughters birthday after she drove two hours for not RSVPing with me.\n2.) The blow back i'm receiving is ls larger than i thought would happen. my wives family and my daughter are on my SIL's side. So i'm wondering if I should have atleast bought more tickets for the tour, despite them being incredibly expensive for single admission at that point.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You sent out emails, texts and had a discussion over the phone about the rsvp. SIL is the AH and so is the rest of the family that are her side", "NTA.  You gave her more than enough chances.  \n\nThe one point I would say Y T A on is not explaining to your daughter ahead of time that if her aunt didn\u2019t RSVP, her cousins wouldn\u2019t have a place at the party, and why.  Once doing so, it would be reasonable to only take that RSVP from SIL, herself, and not because \u2018daughter said cousin said SIL said\u2019 they would be there.", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences.  You gave her every chance not to fuck it up.  And she fucked it up.  That\u2019s on her.", "NTA. Her daughters are going to end up just like her\u2026 acting entitled their whole entire lives. Your daughter may be upset with you right now, but one day she will realize why you did what you did.", "NTA. If it was a regular party then that\u2019s different, but you clearly explained to her you needed to know so that you could plan and spend accordingly. I don\u2019t know who in their right mind would read that, ghost you, and then show up on the day of. I\u2019d be pissed and I\u2019d do the same.", "NTA. You needed to confirm numbers for the tour and the catering. You\u2019ve tried and tried to get confirmation and got ghosted. There was only so much you can do to include them. The guide called security (not you). Your daughter is currently hurt from losing her best friends. Probably you and your wife can try explaining things to her again later when everything has calmed down. Show her proof of the conversation if required.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL deserved it.\n\nIncredibly poor behavior - if anything she owes you and your daughter an apology for causing a ridiculous about of drama.", "NTA\nYour wife is right, ignore her family. Entitled people are a pain and not worth the energy. Good for you for saying no!! \n\nYour guide called security, lol! Must have been quite the show :/ Why would you have bought her last min expensive tickets??", "I say NTA on all fronts. If it\u2019s your responsibility to plan the party with what you had by asking for RSVPs, then it falls those who want to go to RSVP no matter the relationship the birthday person has with those who decide they\u2019re automatically exempt from extending a simple \u201cyeah, I believe we can make that!\u201d You explained to your daughter  with transparency. It\u2019s honestly her choice to seek blame in the situation in the first place. I can understand the hurt of learning my loved ones were escorted from my birthday party; however, I\u2019d want to know what happened instead of looking for someone to be upset with. It looks like she still has to learn that (which is okay and will come with understanding). I think you did the best you could.", "NTA. SIL\u2019s daughters are likely aware of their mother\u2019s behaviour and are probably happy she finally got treated appropriately.", "NTA.\n\nShe was trying to weaponize her willful incompetence.", "NTA\n\nHOWEVER, you do have damage control to do and maybe need to make compromises. The important relationship at risk here is your daughter and her cousins. You aren't in the wrong here as there really wasn't much you could have done. There wasn't food for them, there weren't tickets for them. The venue wouldn't have accomodated them even if you wanted to. I think that's the part that's important for your daughter to understand: even if you had tried to welcome your sister-in-law and her kids with open arms, the venue would have sent them away. You didn't call security on them. Regardless, if theres anything that can be done to help make amends, I would ( within reason) attempt to make things right with the kids for your daughter's sake.", "im sorry your 16 yo daughter called you a dick?? never in my black household\ud83d\udc80", "Info: How much time did you give her to reply? When she says she did try to rsvp, is she straight up lying or is there a chance there was an attempt that got thwarted by a technical glitch?\n\nIf your daughter is so close with her cousins, did she not tell them they need to have their mom rsvp or else they won\u2019t be able to come?", ">I explained to my daughter the situation and she called me a dick.\n\nFor this I say YTA. It was your daughters birthday and these were two very close friends to her. You didn't seem to take her feelings into consideration and made this about adult drama.", "NTA.", "NTA show you daughter everything, tell her the truth of their lack of communication, cite previous events. Tell her you are sorry they didn't get to go, but it would have cost X hundred dollars to buy them tickets without even knowing if they would turn up.", "Or they\u2019re sick of their mom\u2019s behavior being late to everything, and will be the opposite.", "She had at least a month from the phone call where I invited her to the last text asking for some status. She never gave me a proper answer, mostly \"I'll check our schedules and let you know!\" The last text I sent her was never responded to.   \n\n\nHer daughters undoubtedly knew their mom would need to RSVP but the problem is they are just like their mom. They will just ghost my daughter the same way their mom does others.", "Was I supposed to just leave her in the dark? All I told her was that I received no word if they were coming or not. I was paying nearly 60$ per person for the tour and dinner and I never got a full confirmation from them so I didn't buy the tickets.", "Her daughters stopped talking to his daughter, so I doubt it.", "NTA. This situation was entirely avoidable. You gave her ample time to rsvp.", "Let me ask you this: Did you let her know in advance you hadn't heard from her cousins? Did you let her know in advance that, even if they showed up, they wouldn't be let in?", "Out of their own volition, or because SIL isn\u2019t allowing it, or is untruthfully bad-mouthing her?", "Thats what I wondered. I\u2019m sure D would have said to her cousins that her parents need to know and that their mom had to let them know, that they weren\u2019t taking the cousins word for it. \n\nOr call the SIL the night before final numbers had to be in and just ask. It\u2019s now or never, yes or no.", "Not OP, but common sense dictates that if you are going to a party, where event tickets are needed, and a dinner is being catered for everyone, you need to RSVP.", "Great question\u2026 unfortunately either answer sucks.", "I'll  bet she didn't tell her daughters she didn't RSVP", "Yea this seems like the adults got caught up in their own drama and forgot about how this would impact her.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t seem all that upset his daughter (whose party this was) was upset by it", "I'm not talking about the friends, I'm asking if he let his daughter know that her best friends don't have tickets and didn't RSVP.\n\nOr did she find out at the party?", "Indeed.", "So then it\u2019s his daughter\u2019s responsibility to make sure they were at the party by that logic? If it\u2019s op\u2019s responsibility to tell their daughter their cousin\u2019s mother isn\u2019t responding that gives the implication that the daughter is then obligated to make sure, through the cousins, that their mother RSVPs. You don\u2019t think that\u2019s bringing the daughter into adult drama??", "It\u2019s HER party and HER close friends.\n\nYea, I think he should have let her know if advance they didn\u2019t get tickets for them.", "And make her tell their mother to stop being petty and RSVP?", "Did I say that?\n\nHis daughter was clearly upset by this (something he doesn\u2019t seem concerned by). I asked him a pretty simple question of whether or not he informed her in advance they didn\u2019t have tickets. Which he hasn\u2019t answered.\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole for not getting them tickets. I do think he upset his daughter at her birthday. It seems like he explained it to her afterwards and she didn\u2019t know they would be turned away.", "Just want crystal clarity on your viewpoint", "That still sounds like bringing her into adult drama to me. If you heard \u201cso I hope you know that if your aunt doesn\u2019t RSVP you\u2019re cousins won\u2019t be able to come to the party\u201d won\u2019t inadvertently push you to talk about that to your cousins? That sounds like involving her in a sneaky way which I\u2019m sure would\u2019ve caused more problems if the SIL is already willing to ignore a request for an RSVP and show up anyway. That may be an assumption, but I\u2019d rather call it an educated guess. OP can let us know if SIL wouldn\u2019t have been upset that their daughters were being brought into this inadvertently."]}
