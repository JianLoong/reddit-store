{"id": 20597, "submission_id": "14j1hhr", "title": "AITA for having my SIL and her two kids escorted away by security because she refused to RSVP?", "selftext": "Last week was our daughter's 16th birthday. We decided to go all out on her party for a variety of reasons. This would include a private tour of a place she's wanted to go to and we rented out a room to have a catered dinner. This should all have been just a smooth ride, Right? Enter my SIL.\n\nMy wife and her sister do not get along. They can keep up a causal relationship for the sake of family but that's it. It doesn't help that my experiences with my SIL have been incredibly dramatic. She's quick to play the victim and gaslight. SIL has two daughters who are practically best friends with my daughter. So obviously she wanted to invite them. \n\nOne big issue with SIL and her family is that when it comes to coordinating anything with them, they are unreliable on a good day and like trying to communicate with a blind deaf person who does not speak the same language as you on a bad one. They are never on time, sometimes hours (or in one case a day) late, and will not communicate at all if they are planning to show up. The thing I hate the most is that she will just text you randomly after an event started saying they decided not to come, or show up when they said they said they can't make it.\n\nBecause my wife does not get along with her, I told her I would handle it. I sent two emails, and three texts, and had a 20-minute phone call with SIL months ago telling her what we were doing for my daughter's birthday. Because of what we were planning, we needed to buy tickets for everyone and tell the caterers how many they were serving. I needed an RSVP as soon as humanly possible to organize this stuff. She either needed to be on time or tell me she could not make it. I told her if she ghosts me, there will be no tickets for her and her kids. \n\nShe ghosted me. I didn't buy her and her kid's tickets.\n\nSIL and her kids showed up (on time somehow) for the event. \n\nMy wife was livid, so I handled the situation on my own and told my SIL and her kids they need to leave because we did not get tickets for her. If she wanted to join us for the tour it would cost quite a bit to get new tickets, and the caterers do not allow alterations after a certain amount of time out from the event. At first, she tried to say she did RSVP with me, and then eventually started to shame me. Our guide called security and in the end, she and her daughters were escorted away.\n\nThe event was great, but my SIL's entire family has blown up at me and my wife. The event was 2 hours away from SIL's home and they say it was heartless of me to turn her away after the trip. Along with this, her daughters have now stopped talking to my daughter. Telling her that I kicked them out of her party. I explained to my daughter the situation and she called me a dick. My wife has told me to ignore her family and that daughter will realize we're not in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1687737531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14j1hhr/aita_for_having_my_sil_and_her_two_kids_escorted/", "score": 978, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Once doing so, it would be reasonable to only take that RSVP from SIL, herself, and not because \u2018daughter said cousin said SIL said\u2019 they would be there.", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences.

Your daughter may be upset with you right now, but one day she will realize why you did what you did.", "NTA. If it was a regular party then that\u2019s different, but you clearly explained to her you needed to know so that you could plan and spend accordingly.

Probably you and your wife can try explaining things to her again later when everything has calmed down.

It\u2019s honestly her choice to seek blame in the situation in the first place. I can understand the hurt of learning my loved ones were escorted from my birthday party; however, I\u2019d want to know what happened instead of looking for someone to be upset with. It looks like she still has to learn that (which is okay and will come with understanding). I think you did the best you could.", "NTA.

The important relationship at risk here is your daughter and her cousins. You aren't in the wrong here as there really wasn't much you could have done. There wasn't food for them, there weren't tickets for them. The venue wouldn't have accomodated them even if you wanted to. I think that's the part that's important for your daughter to understand: even if you had tried to welcome your sister-in-law and her kids with open arms, the venue would have sent them away.

I\u2019m sure D would have said to her cousins that her parents need to know and that their mom had to let them know, that they weren\u2019t taking the cousins word for it. \n\nOr call the SIL the night before final numbers had to be in and just ask.

Which he hasn\u2019t answered.\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole for not getting them tickets. I do think he upset his daughter at her birthday.

That sounds like involving her in a sneaky way which I\u2019m sure would\u2019ve caused more problems if the SIL is already willing to ignore a request for an RSVP and show up anyway.

My parents threw me a sweet 16 and I fully understood at that age what RSVP meant, and shut down any last minute stragglers.

My take is that you knew in advance the outcome and you decided to go ahead with it anyway. Yes you are a dick and it burns you because you have been called on it.

This was a situation the adults let their pride get the better of them, and the kids suffered. Hope your daughter learns to forgive you.", " NTA. I love a good FAFO.\n\nTime to stop invite this inconsiderate to future events. The rudeness here is astonishing", "ESH. You should have had the mom whip out her card to pay for the extra spots and then given her a talk about the RSVP & being better about plans. I get the retribution feels good, but my sister is like this as well and I *hate* it, but if it was my kid's party, my dislike comes second to my kid having a good time. The mom could have not gone of the tour to get food for her girls so when it came time to eat, they had a meal, too. There was an everyone wins situation here that you didn't bother to utilize it. You could have still bricked her and said \"well, this is what you have to do since you didn't RSVP. That's why we have RSVP.\"\n\nIf you knew she was like this and your daughters are BFF with her daughters, why not ask your daughter to text her friend?? Why try going through the flaky mom??", "Dude.  Wtf???\n\nYou need to tell anyone one very simple truth.  You didn't kick them out of the tour.  The place you were touring did because they didn't have tickets.  You didn't kick them out of dinner.  The restaurant did, because they had no way to know they were coming.  It would not have mattered if you wanted her there or not, shit was out of your hands.  nta", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo let me ask....for the people who are mad at you OP. What could have been done so they could enter? Pay for tickets? Where the original tickets going to be paid for by you or them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all she was told to RSVP and she did not. She KNEW she did not but showed up anyway. She has a history of being late and other drama so this is nothing new it seems.", "Nta", "Your nieces and nephews are absolutely screwed with a mother like that.  It might be better to not socialize with the SIL.", "NTA. Ask everyone who is giving you a hard time which three people should you have removed so that SIL and her daughters could have stayed? Perhaps you and your wife and the birthday girl would have been awesome choices? You told her the consequences of her inactions. She didn't believe you.", "NTA\n\nYou did everything possible by writing so you have the recipts to show she failed on her end", "NTA. Similar situation: I am also best friends with my chronically late cousins. Idk where you\u2019re from but if I was having MY 16th birthday and my cousins/best friends were invited I PERSONALLY would\u2019ve texted them and managed the invitation and made sure they were there. Your daughter has no right to call you a dick when, from the looks of it, she knows how they are and didn\u2019t do anything for the situation. She\u2019s 16 and that\u2019s high age to also take responsibility for her friends and these cousins are also her friends.", "NTA you handled this appropriately. I didn\u2019t love you comparing her shitty communication style to blind and deaf people though - in my experience, they communicate just fine.", "NTA. \n\nSIL sounds like a bully, possible personality disorder. Don\u2019t fall for her tricks. Sleep soundly knowing you did everything you could to include them. The rest is on SIL.\n\nDon\u2019t expect a just-turned-16 to *fully* grasp concepts like justice, boundaries and respect for self and others. But this could be a great learning opportunity! Stand your ground to set a good example. Make clear that you would\u2019ve loved to include the daughters. Explain the venue rules and the lengths you went to to communicate all of this to SIL. Their exclusion was a direct result of their mother\u2019s choices. \n\nIt was not your decision. It was hers.", " NTA. She didn\u2019t rsvp, and she\u2019s flipping out over the consequences.", "Your daughter *will* realize with time.\n\nAnd so will her kids.\n\nSome people just think rules don\u2019t matter for them.", "INFO: The kids are 16 and have their own phones. Why didn\u2019t you or your daughter just contact them directly and asked jf they were coming? No need to go through your SIL.", "Why?  why do people think being  late or not replying and assuming they are fine is ok. ?  Respect manners decency.", "I actually think you were TA here. It was your daughters birthday, not your chance to teach your chronically disorganised and overdramatic SIL a lesson. \nFor your daughter\u2019s sake, and hers alone, SIL was the mountain that needed to be moved. That\u2019s just the way it was. All your reasons for being hardline might be justifiable to your mind, but you still have a hurt birthday girl.\n\nI do find it hard to believe your 16 year old daughter had no idea whether her \u201cpractically best friends\u201d were coming ahead of time. Does she not have a phone of her own? Was it a surprise party? A 16 year old staying out of her own party organising & inviting seems quite odd. \n\nSlightly off topic but it sounds like SIL might have ADHD.", "NTA for turning SIL away when she hadn\u2019t rsvp\u2019d but where\u2019s the rest of the story? Your daughter is turning 16. Does she not have email, a phone, facebook messenger, any other social media with messaging so that she can contact her cousins who\u2019s she\u2019s apparently so close to? I came from a dysfunctional family, and yet back in the early 2000s my cousins and I still stayed in touch by msn when our parents were NC. How hard could it have been for your daughter to contact her cousins and ask them if they\u2019re coming or not?", "NTA - however, I would have taken things further. I would have allowed the kids to come in but not her, it's not the kids fault their mom is like this. But definitely would have left the Sil what outside", "INFO: how did this reach the level security got called? We\u2019re you guys yelling at each other? At any point, did you say you wanted them removed?\n\nAlso, you never informed your daughter her favorite cousins weren\u2019t going to be at her party before this happened?", "I find it intriguing why you didn't consider getting your daughter to invite her cousins since they are close. I assume they are close in age, ie teens. Vs you (supposedly neutral) and your wife (contentious) inviting your SIL. \n\nAre you in a way setting them up to fail, knowing how unreliable SIL is? \n\n\nThis problem could have ended at your generation, but now the cousins are affected as well.", "So no, YTA technically\u2026 but it seems like you and your wife made this about your SIL instead of your daughter.", "NTA. This is a pretty clear case of the consequences of her own actions. She is being petty and lashing out because someone called her out on her shit and didn't cave in and make accommodations for her. Obviously, the situation is a bit sticky with your daughters being so close, but I would throw her in the trash and say good riddance to bad rubbish.", "Your wife is correct. Sorry you had to deal with that mess but your daughter will understand soon enough. NTA", "Did you ever send messages to the daughters?", "OP should send a mass email to the family with proof of these exchanges to prove his point.", "Agreed NTA though I do wonder if SIL could have been the one to pay to have her kids on the tour or if she wasn\u2019t willing to pay for them and wanted op to pay", "I\u2019m kind of surprised the daughter wasn\u2019t more involved. If I was besties with my cousin\u2019s we would be talking about the party all the time, and maybe would tell them to make sure their mom doesn\u2019t drop the ball!\n\n I also feel like if all the girls are close, maybe the cousin\u2019s could have spent the night before hand or something so they could remove flaky mom from the equation, because although I agree NTA it really sucks that all of the girls missed out\u2026 maybe they live too far away or something", "There's no reason to think the cousins new what their mom was up to. If SIL is this thoughtless, I would assume she just lied to her daughters and told them whatever story served her needs in the moment. No reason I would have questioned my mom at that age \"But did you remember to RSVP mom?\" Plus, they are not exactly getting a good example on the necessity of an RSVP.", "He said they still could have gotten tickets at an increased price. Just pointing out that they could have been included.\n\n(OP stated this in his Judgement Bot explanation of why he may be the AH.)", "I echo that. NTA with hesitation. Given the way you talk about that relationship with SIL. were you \\*really\\* open to reaching them? If the cousins are your daughter's besties, then not reaching out in a way that works for them (probably not 'months in advance' and a single phone call) means you are creating a no-win situation for yourself/family. She sounds like a person that's unable to plan ahead. I totally get your daughter's reaction and bet she's basing it on other things you've done as well. I encourage you to admit to her you have some doubts about how it went down and talk through ways you both could have done better. Could she have taken responsibility for any of the planning (I sure would not have let my parents plan the guest list!), and so forth.", "Why do I hear this sentiment all the time attached to race lmao. \"Not in my good dominican-hispanic-virgo household!\"", "Because paying for the tickets the day of the tour would be a pretty pretty big price increase that OP would have to fork out because the SIL and cousins are a bunch of flakes. Plus, since the catering already had a headcount, there wouldn't be food for the three of them.  \n  \nIt may be the daughter's birthday, but since she's not paying for a single thing, she's going to have to suck it up and learn that the world doesn't revolve around what she wants.", "For real. I literally cannot believe all these N T A responses. It was his *daughter's* birthday. And he went scorched earth on the SIL and her daughters (who he proclaimed in a comment are \"just like their mom,\" so apparently he doesn't have much love for them, either) and had them physically removed from his *daughter's* party, knowing full-well she would want them to be there. This entire situation is insane to me, and it's even more insane that literally no one on this thread, basically, sees any problem with it.\n\nPut your feuding aside for one night for the sake of your daughter. You know, the birthday girl.", "He finally got back at her...by somehow making her not RSVP when he tried to confirm with her on multiple occasions???  \n  \nTour tickets the day-of would be much more in price. Unless SIL was going to fork over the money, then they only have themselves to blame.", "Bingo! SIL seems to be a master manipulator. I think SIL was also the more favoured one between her and OP's wife during their childhood which has led to the resentment and bitterness between the two to this day.\n\nOP is NTA but I think he needs to sit with daughter along with his wife and explain her the whole situation and also teach daughter not to call her own dad a 'dick'.", "Yeah, I was wondering why OP tried:\n\nOP -> SIL\n\nInstead of\n\nOP -> Daughter -> Cousins -> SIL", "they do live about 2 hours away so that's probably why I'm assuming", "Her non-answer answers and ghosting are effectively saying \"no\", but she clearly expects them to be treated as a \"yes\". You're NTA.\n\nThe only way you could have *maybe* been more clear & communicative would have been to specify a date you needed an answer by (which you probably did and just haven't mentioned here) **and** send a follow up text on that date to the effect of \"since didn't hear anything, I'm taking that its a 'no'\".\n\nIf you have to deal with her like this in the future, that clear deadline & clear \"deadline has passed\" message combo if she's playing the ghosting game might start to teach her that rsvp deadlines actually mean something to other people.\n\nIt might still take a few rounds of her showning up anyway and being told the prior communication was sincere, but it should eventually sink in.", "Yes, but I've learned not to be too disappointed with Redditor judgments, as you see some of the pettiest, most immature people on here. Good to see selfless people, though:)", "Never got a \"full confirmation\"..? That implies that you did, in fact, get some sort of halfway confirmation. What type of sort-of-confirmation did you receive? \n\nIt was your daughter's birthday. Even if it would have costed more to add their tickets on the spot, you said it yourself that you were already going all out for her sweet 16 party, so why could you not have just stifled your annoyance for one night and purchased the extra tickets? Or given them the chance to get their own tickets?\n\nI thought the point of this whole sweet 16 blowout party was to make your daughter happy. You put yourself and your resentments ahead of what you knew she would want on her birthday. That alone makes you in the wrong in this situation, not even bringing up the fact that you had them physically removed by security.", "oh for sure the daughter is also an AH in this situation in my opinion. i\u2019m a 17m and i would never for the life of me call either of my parents a bad name, ESPECIALLY after taking me out for my birthday to a place i\u2019ve always wanted to tour and catering dinner. that is so luxurious and i\u2019d be so lucky but to call my dad a dick for (rightfully) kicking out my two cousins who im close with? never in a million years\n\nedit: spelling", "2 hours away from the venue/ tour is what I read. But they could all live in different places or closer to each other.", "We never spanked. We did, however, take away privileges\u2014and he lost quite a few that day and for quite awhile. You don\u2019t have to hit kids to get them to respect you.", "I got hit in the mouth if I ever said something sideways to my parents and I\u2019m perfectly fine", "You know that assessment describes you and the whiny child above you as well, right?", "I guess a middle way is to not allow sil to participate. Only the daughters. SIL can go read a book somewhere and wait.", "Ahh good point", "My apologies for the unfair assumption. I read between the lines and I was wrong.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Or this will remain a bad memory of how her parents didn\u2019t communicate with her and upset her on her birthday", "It does suck. Having said that, my mother was EXACTLY like this SIL. If I had tried to communicate someone after she made a martyr of herself, it would\u2019ve been a \u201cbetrayal\u201d, leading to abuse. We truly do not know what goes on behind closed doors; from the outside looking in, my own family looked \u201cperfect\u201d- nice house, cars, upper class, pious, active in the community, successful, etc. Meanwhile, the actual reality of the dynamic was horrific. While their behavior isn\u2019t polite, without knowing what their home life is like, it\u2019s probably best to reserve judgement until they\u2019re out from under her thumb. (I just mean for not communicating, especially on a phone where their mom could have a key logger installed or parental software. If they\u2019re treating OP\u2019s daughter badly outside of the lack of communication, that\u2019s a different story.)", "You would think that, if they're such good friends that missing her birthday would be so traumatic, daughter herself would've *communicate* with them for a \"I will be there\" answer.", "And how do we know they didn\u2019t tell his daughter that they would be there?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like Dad told her they didn\u2019t RSVP"]}
