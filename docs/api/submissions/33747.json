We all get together, have food, and open presents as a family.\n\nI drank quite a bit that day. I had a beer, 2 cups of wine, and cocktails. I was definitely not in a very coherent state while we were opening presents.\n\nMy entire family got me dresses and make up.

I went to the living room and went onto a crisis line since I was not in a very good spot.\n\nMy dad saw me in the living room on my phone and told me to join the family and be more respectful to everyone. I lashed out and told him that I did not want to be around my family anymore \u201cbut fine i\u2019ll do what he says\u201d\n\nMy father said that I was an Asshole for not being in the christmas spirit and being rude during a time of happiness and gratitude.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n  \nInfo: I am 15 years old. I was drinking because christmas is a known rough time for me because of some trauma related stuff so my dad decided to let me have some drinks so I was less of a bitch to be around I suppose.

You deserve better", "Trans man to trans man, It will get better. You are absolutely not the asshole. I came out 5 years ago in December and at first I dealt with exactly with what you\u2019re going through. For years after I came out I got birthday cards with \u201chappy birthday daughter\u201d and all that. It almost felt like my family would intentionally do things like that just to upset me and drive the point home that they would never see me as a man. Eventually they did come around although it was a long road with many hiccups. Continue living your truth and be strong. You will find people who will love you and respect you for who you are. Hang in there dude.", "You\u2019re 15??? If this is real, then right from the get go, your dad is the asshole for letting you drink. You\u2019re underage! That\u2019s just messed up. He also should have let you have your alone time when he needed it, especially since he knew you were drunk. I don\u2019t know if your family are complete assholes because I don\u2019t know how well they know you, but if they do know you are a trans man or even if they at least know you don\u2019t like girly things, then buying you makeup and dresses to try to turn you into a pretty girl was just cruel, and if they don\u2019t know you\u2019re trans then they were still really misguided for thinking new dresses would fix the problem if you are visibly not taking care of yourself.

Not even at godawful family holidays where everyone is being shitty, because alcohol creates far more problems than it solves.", "NTA, I am a cisgendered woman and if someone bought me makeup and dresses along with a comment that I should take care of myself better to conform to THEIR beauty standards I\"d have a huge problem with that, and I don't have to deal with dysphoria on top of that.
