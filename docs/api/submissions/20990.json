Adam is insisting on the surprise wedding however, and says he will ask Sara's sister to distract her the day of instead.\n\nI told him I feel obligated to tell her, as I know she hates surprises and I want her to feel prepared not ambushed at this event.

More importantly, this isn't just a surprise - he's taken hostage an entire wedding assuming she'll agree to it under the guise of a surprise.
