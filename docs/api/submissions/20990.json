More importantly, this isn't just a surprise - he's taken hostage an entire wedding assuming she'll agree to it under the guise of a surprise.

Because, EVEN if she LOVES the surprise, dont you think shed want the opportunity to pick a dress and get her makeup done? even if her sister casually takes her out for stuff that would accomplish that, its not the same as getting to pick your wedding dress and having your makeup done with your bridal party.", "In Aus that would certainly be true, but laws vary so wildly around the world, who knows?\n\nIf you want to reduce the chance of drama, u/west_journalist4611, ask the bf whether he's got a marriage licence.", "In Canada only one person needs to be present. You just need both birth certificates. So if they live together he could sneakily get the license assuming access to required documents.", "TRUE!!", "I would bet that Adam senses that Sarah is pulling away from him and he\u2019s throwing a surprise wedding with everyone one present to push her into the commitment.", "I honestly hope this post is fake, I really want to believe that there aren\u2019t that many stupid people in this girls life, that think, even if she was the queen of surprises, that she would want \u201cthe happiest day of her life\u201d to be a damn surprise that she had ZERO say in", "Or he could feel her pulling away or seeing the signs that things are not great in the relationship, and he is trying to do a big gesture to save the relationship\n Still the wrong way to go about it, but he could be aware that there's issues in the relationship.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s missing the signals at all. He\u2019s feeling her pulling away and is attempting to force the issue.", "you\u2019re very gracious, thank you goddess", "IS A DICK LIKE GASTON", "You have to apply for a marriage license with both parties present. That is done at the county up to 3 months before the wedding. It is really more like an application to get married, and it doesn't go in to effect until the wedding officiant signs off on it (and it has to be submitted back to the county).\n\nSo yes, it would be a fake wedding until she agreed to go to the court house to do all the paperwork", "Yes most people sign at the wedding, but you still have to go to the city hall or whatever government building to get the marriage certificate and that *usually* requires both parties to be there.", "BC here - I picked up ours alone, no ID needed 7 years ago.  I had even ordered a new birth certificate for myself and was told it wasn't needed.", "For me is eerie familiar with this other story. And the main complains of the bride: she hate surprises, the peer pressure of every person on the place (I think it was a backyard ceremony and the groom wanted to do the paperwork few days later) getting angry with her for saying no till she left, and the lack of preparedness (she was wearing something very inadequate)", "This sounds very similar to one I read a couple months ago. I think it\u2019s fake.", "I don\u2019t know if both have to be present to apply. In my state, the application is online, and does not require documents or identification to be submitted, as long as you have all the required information on each person, which includes Full Names, Date of Birth, Gender, Place of Birth, SS numbers, Current address, Names and Places of Birth of parents, ethnicity, race, education level, and phone number. Most of which he could acquire if family is really into the plan. We also electronically sign which is considered appearing in court for the application.", "Ok good to know, I imagine the break-up will be real thiugh", "I applied for a marriage license online. Once we received it, we got married and we signed it right after.", "My wedding did not require this, so rules do vary depending on jurisdiction. I know this because it's about the only thing my husband was asked to take care of (he was in charge of the tuxes, the hotel room, and the marriage license) and he got it done completely without me.", "yeah.... so just an unoriginal troll hopefully, with no poor woman actually being thrown a surprise wedding lol. Its SO obvious that nobody would want this.", "That\u2019s honestly kinda horrific? Like I can imagine a lot of horror scenarios that could play out", "What state do you live in?! I've never heard of not needing to submit identification and the process in your state sounds terrifying.", "I mean, yeah, I was definitely surprised to learn this, but both parties do have to be in attendance for the officiant or judge to sign off on the marriage, this is just an application.", "I mean, you do submit information about your identification on the application, you\u2019re just not required to submit the documents. They can use your information to find birth certificates and verify validity, so maybe it\u2019s to prevent forged documents passing through the system."]}
