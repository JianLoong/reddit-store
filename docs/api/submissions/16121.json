They asked me to hold the baby whilst they get their food and I said sure but I didn\u2019t know how to hold the baby because she didn\u2019t tell me so I was just sitting their like with my hands underneath the baby. Then the baby started rolling and fell out of my hands onto the floor and she cried and my relative starts berating me about it and I cried of course because I\u2019m being shouted at and everyone was mad at me for dropping the baby so I just went to my room and stayed there the entire time. Never held a baby after that out of fear that I will drop them.\n\nI still don\u2019t know how to hold a baby properly so I just said one final no and went to my room and I could hear my aunt from the living me calling me disrespectful and that I\u2019m disgusted by her child.

It's your right to express your boundaries; others should respect them. You did show interest in the baby and the aunt, so it's not like you ignored or disrespected them.

They're probably trying to train you for being a free babysitter somewhere down the road is what it seems like to me.

Lol! Unless you really despise  babies or the parents, I would say yes, but tell them you know nothing about babies, sit down and have them show you how to pick up, hold, and put down a baby.

You set boundaries and stuck to them. \nNTA.", "NTA of course \ud83d\ude42\nYou said no and that's awful they did not respect your boundaries.\nDouble awful noone bothered to even show you how to correctly hold a baby.

I wouldn't even let my husband have my baby half the time and she's demanding people who don't even want the child to hold the child?? Maybe it's a cultural difference but to me this lady is just crazy cakes", "NTA, when my kids were babies I didn't gave them to hold to anyone who wasn't comfortable with holding them.

Like I have my own I'm good lol", "NTA\n\nI loved holding my babies and really did not want to pass them around. I\u2019ll hold other people\u2019s babies momentarily if that is their vibe, but I quickly hand them off (usually there is someone in the crowd clamoring for their turn).", "NTA\n\n\"No\" is a complete sentence and your family needs to respect your bodily autonomy. Idk why your aunt, or some parents in general, think that everyone just would love holding their baby. I don't hate kids or babies, but I don't want to hold them!\n\nAlso, if your aunt tries that \"OP thinks my baby is disgusting!\" nonsense, just tell her you don't think her baby is disgusting, you think he/she is breathtaking.", "NTA\n\nMy guess is that the aubt had noticed that OP is not terribly excited about kids and not eager to bond with them. For some people, if you are a woman, this hits the nerve. Really dunno why.\n\nSo maybe if even though OP is very young she is annoyed about her reluctance for having kids. Atleast I would assume it is not the next step for OP and likely will never been. So she has been looking for an opportunity to get offended and say there is something wrong with OP. Which there of course isn't!\n\nHolding baby is very intimate, ofcourse you can say no! I once hold 2 week old and hated the whole minute. OP you do you, great work at keeping boundaries!

She's wrong on two counts.", "NTA\n\nI don't hold babies under 6 month because they're kinda \"fragile\" and I'm hella scared to drop a baby.\n\nThey traumatized you and didn't respect your boundaries.

There is nothing wrong with not enjoying kids and \u201cno\u201d is a complete answer.", "And why can't parents respect other people's bodily autonomy?? No means No!", "Methinks that had OP been a boy, she wouldn't have asked you to hold the baby or called you disrespecful.", "She doesnt need to provide them any back info for her discomfort holding babies. No should be lore than enough reason. \n\nLearning to hold a baby properly doesn\u2019t guarantee the anxieties she developed from that bad experience will go away. \n\nShe can and seemingly does enjoy her niece as it currently is without needing to hold her. So why pressure eventually into learning to do something she flat out isnt comfortable with? \n\nHow exactly is not holding a baby who wont even remember their infant years harmful to their relationship?", "NTA.\n\nI have two children of my own (well, they are both adults and parents themselves now). I love my kids, and my grandkids, but don't like babies, especially other people's babies (my own kids terrified me when they were babies). This is relevant.\n\nMy nephew is 7 years younger than my youngest child. At a family gathering, my (at the time) BIL tried to get me to hold my nephew (I think he (nephew) was about 4 months old at the time). I said no. He (BIL) laughed and kept on trying - I still said no. He brought nephew over and put him in my lap, expecting me to hold him. I put both hands in the air and told BIL he'd better grab his kid before he rolled off my lap. BIL grabbed kid and grumped off. Everyone else there (including my sister/his (then) wife) all berated him and told him I absolutely meant it when I told him no, and he was in the wrong. He was grumpy for the rest of the day, but my family just said 'Meh - she told you no, we all told you she'd say no, you didn't listen, sucks to be you'.\n\nI still don't like babies.", "NTA.\n\nDid you tell your aunt why you didn't want to hold the baby, by the way?

Explain to your mom that you\u2019re still scared because you dropped the last baby. I don\u2019t know why people insist you hold their babies either. Think of all the diseases going around.", "NTA and the adults in your life have apparently always been out of line. No one should've expected a child to know how to hold a baby, nor should they have left you and the baby unattended. They were neglectful and projected their failure onto you.\n\nNow, they still expect you to magically know what to do. A good parent would never want their child to be held by someone who doesn't want to or doesn't know how to. Babies aren't objects, they're human beings who deserve better than to be passed around like a souvenir.", "I'm a bit confused how you could have possibly held a baby so incorrectly that it rolled out of your arms? You said the baby was almost a year old so wouldn't the baby have been able to sit on your hip or keep themselves somewhat upright?", "NTA. I used to never want to hold babies either because I was afraid something would happen. And as a parent now, I NEVER made anyone hold my babies if they didn\u2019t want to. It\u2019s just weird. What sort of power play is that? HOLD MY BABY OR ELSE? It\u2019s odd. You don\u2019t need to touch or hold anyone\u2019s kid.", " NTA I always offer my baby to friends and family, just because I know most people want to hold him, with the exception of my sister who I know is terrified of babies. If anyone ever says no then that's fine, I don't want to hand him off to someone that isn't prepared to hold him properly/ safely. Anyone that has been around babies should be able to tell when someone doesn't know how to hold one properly, so it is totally that other relatives fault that their baby got dropped when you were 10, they should have made sure to tell you and show you how to hold baby before walking away and leave an experienced adult with you.", "I\u2019ve got a baby nephew I absolutely adore but I don\u2019t always want to hold him. When he was really little I was also scared of somehow hurting him and now that he\u2019s getting bigger he likes to jump/wiggle which can be a bit of a work out to keep him in your arms. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all disrespectful to decline holding someone else\u2019s child for any reason as long as you aren\u2019t rude about it which it doesn\u2019t sound like you were.", "NTA but I have a feeling this was about your attitude and tone more than your refusal.", "Nta. I would never force anyone to hold my baby. And I would always make sure my baby is safely held.\n\nWith a younger kid who wants to hold but is not comfortable there are ways like doing it sitting on the floor. I always check my baby is correctly held even by my 30yo friends who don't have kids.", "NTA.", "NTA, some people just don't know how to act.

Jeeez...\nEntitled mothers out there...", "Heck, I am 36, a mother myself, I know how to hold a baby, yet I haven\u2019t held any other baby that isn\u2019t my kid.
