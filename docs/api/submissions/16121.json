I will play with them if they\u2019re bored but I won\u2019t go as far as to shout no at them instantly. I just prefer to be in my room when I know my baby cousin\u2019s are over. I\u2019ll say hi as well like to be respectful and stuff but not chill if you get what I mean.\n\nThe other day, my aunt came over with her newborn baby girl that she recently gave birth to like a couple months ago. She\u2019s cute and stuff and I said hi and asked all the questions about life with the new baby to be nice. Then she asked if I wanted to hold the baby and I said \u201cno thank you\u201d and she got very aggy with me about it and kept insisting I hold the baby even though I said I didn\u2019t want to. My mum tried to tell me to hold the baby but I didn\u2019t want to do I said no.\n\nA little backstory, when I was like 9-10 another relative brought over their baby and they were like almost a year old. They asked me to hold the baby whilst they get their food and I said sure but I didn\u2019t know how to hold the baby because she didn\u2019t tell me so I was just sitting their like with my hands underneath the baby. Then the baby started rolling and fell out of my hands onto the floor and she cried and my relative starts berating me about it and I cried of course because I\u2019m being shouted at and everyone was mad at me for dropping the baby so I just went to my room and stayed there the entire time. Never held a baby after that out of fear that I will drop them.\n\nI still don\u2019t know how to hold a baby properly so I just said one final no and went to my room and I could hear my aunt from the living me calling me disrespectful and that I\u2019m disgusted by her child. I\u2019m not I just don\u2019t want to hold the baby, imma just look from afar. \nMy mother thinks I\u2019m an asshole for not wanting to hold the baby even when I reminded her about that incident in the past. I don\u2019t think I was the asshole but maybe I should have went along with it and held the baby. I\u2019m not sure how my tone came across when I said no either but maybe it was rude.\nNot sure any help would be great", "created_utc": 1682938306, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134j412/aita_for_not_wanting_to_hold_my_aunts_new_baby/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t get why every new parent thinks everyone wants to hold their infants. I\u2019m 32 and I will avoid holding a baby unless there is no other option.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe it to anyone to hold their baby. Your mom and aunt are the AHs because they didn\u2019t respect your choice of what to do with your body.", "I'll never understand people who get offended that you don't want to hold their baby. NTA at all. You politely declined and she got upset. That's on her, not you.", "NTA and it's weird to want a non-parent to hold your child that desperately IMO", "NTA, \n\nNo means no. If you want maybe your aunt can guide you how to hold a baby properly and assist you?", "Honestly what is it with people who demand others hold their child?\n\nYou didn't want to. Not that you need a reason to justify it, but you also had a good reason. \n\nNTA", "NTA it's your decision and you don't have to do something you don't want to. No explanation needed. But for your own it maybe nice to work around the traumatic incident, if you at some point would like to have your own child.", "NTA - Your body, your choice and it is understandable you would be unwanting to hold the baby after what happened to you in the past. \n\nThat time when you dropped a baby was not your fault you know and the way your family reacted is very OTT imo. To shout at a 9 yesr old who has never held a baby before, who was never showed how to hold a baby properly and the baby was in the \"I am learning to move and roll around stage\" is unfair. Not your fault.", "NTA. People should stop trying to get other people to hold their babies if those people are uncomfortable. No is a full sentence.", "nta. the baby is the parents responsibility especially if you or anyone said no to holding it", "NTA\n\nIts your own decision how you will interact with the baby. \n\nYou may consider to try to hold a baby, first could be with a doll so you can learn how it feels now. \n\nDont let you push! \n\nNo is no, what ever other people may talk about.", "NTA. It's your right to express your boundaries; others should respect them. You did show interest in the baby and the aunt, so it's not like you ignored or disrespected them. Maybe you can talk to your aunt and explain that you love her and the baby, but you are uncomfortable holding it and scared of accidentally hurting it. \r  \n\r  \nI find it strange that the aunt insisted so much on you holding the baby.", "NTA\n\nI have a child and I have very little interest in holding someone else's baby. The only reason I do it is that I remember what it was like to just want someone to take mine off me for a few minutes. But that is not your problem.\n\nIt's entirely your prerogative and I don't understand why they, as actual grown ups, have a problem with it.", "NTA - a mother really shouldn\u2019t want someone who isn\u2019t keen on it to hold their baby? That\u2019s so weird. Also you\u2019re totally valid to genuinely fear holding one with that background, and personally I would thank you for your honesty rather than holding my child and them being at risk. \n\nI wish everyone was like you, I hated when people wanted to hold my baby (so did he) and I\u2019m not looking forward to it again now that I\u2019m pregnant\u2026", "NTA You don\u2019t want to hold babies? Don\u2019t hold babies.

Holding my perfect infant is the solution to all your problems in life and if you don't WANT to hold my progeny, you are a seriously disturbed, hateful and selfish individual...\"  I don't think that she feels THAT extreme about it, but that's just so strange. They're probably trying to train you for being a free babysitter somewhere down the road is what it seems like to me. For your aunt AND your mom to get super snarky over not wanting to hold a baby is just cringy in SO MANY WAYS. Feel free to use my absurd sarcastic quote above the next time they go all wonky for you not holding the baby. \n\nGo, live your life,, and may you always be as baby free as you wish at every moment henceforth!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It would be nice but not necessary if the day came soon so you can enjoy your niece. Avoidance is only good for harmful and not harmless relationship building things", "The message I got, was more than not liking kids!  She is a little afraid of them and worried she might inadvertently hurt them- the fact that she hides in her room means she hasn\u2019t seen the baby with newer people and how they handle them. I don\u2019t care if Op wants children out wants to babysit other people\u2019s  children But please learn how to pick up, hold and put down a baby!", "NTA , but I see a lot of harsh YTA toward parents who want you to admire and fall in love with their baby, who happens  to the best baby ever!!!  Lol! Unless you really despise  babies or the parents, I would say yes, but tell them you know nothing about babies, sit down and have them show you how to pick up, hold, and put down a baby.  I think your dislike of babies comes from your early experience / sounds like everyone was new to babies at the time and overreacted.\n Newborns are not that tiny and new for very long, I would hate to see you miss out because of an old fear.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt is not yours - you do not have to hold it.\n\nI do think you might need to work on what puts you off, as you will need to hold a baby if you have your own.", "NTA. I wish these parents would learn that not everyone wants to hold their baby. Hell, I had the opposite problem. I had to tell total strangers at Walmart that they couldn't just pick my daughter up. You set boundaries and stuck to them. \nNTA.", "NTA of course \ud83d\ude42\nYou said no and that's awful they did not respect your boundaries.\nDouble awful noone bothered to even show you how to correctly hold a baby. You think they would at least do that for both the babies safety and your piece of mind. \nTeam No Kids and Happy here \ud83d\ude09", "As a somewhat new mom WTH is wrong with that lady. I wouldn't even let my husband have my baby half the time and she's demanding people who don't even want the child to hold the child?? Maybe it's a cultural difference but to me this lady is just crazy cakes", "NTA, when my kids were babies I didn't gave them to hold to anyone who wasn't comfortable with holding them. And I don't like holding babies of others people, I had my own and I'm done with small babies.", "Nta", "NTA. I think its so weird when parents are like this. I hated when I'd go somewhere and people expected to play pass the baby with my kids and get mad when I didn't let people hold them. I also don't like when people insist I hold their baby. Like I have my own I'm good lol", "NTA\n\nI loved holding my babies and really did not want to pass them around. I\u2019ll hold other people\u2019s babies momentarily if that is their vibe, but I quickly hand them off (usually there is someone in the crowd clamoring for their turn).", "NTA\n\n\"No\" is a complete sentence and your family needs to respect your bodily autonomy. Idk why your aunt, or some parents in general, think that everyone just would love holding their baby. I don't hate kids or babies, but I don't want to hold them!\n\nAlso, if your aunt tries that \"OP thinks my baby is disgusting!\" nonsense, just tell her you don't think her baby is disgusting, you think he/she is breathtaking.", "NTA\n\nMy guess is that the aubt had noticed that OP is not terribly excited about kids and not eager to bond with them. For some people, if you are a woman, this hits the nerve. Really dunno why.\n\nSo maybe if even though OP is very young she is annoyed about her reluctance for having kids. Atleast I would assume it is not the next step for OP and likely will never been. So she has been looking for an opportunity to get offended and say there is something wrong with OP. Which there of course isn't!\n\nHolding baby is very intimate, ofcourse you can say no! I once hold 2 week old and hated the whole minute. OP you do you, great work at keeping boundaries! You will have this kind of situation in the future so don't listen to anyone saying you should be different.", "Exactly, I'm 50. Have 2 kids of my own, held them. Other than that, unless I really really have to I won't hold other people's kids and the crying from children that aren't yours, OMG, so fucking annoying.", "Personally, when I was a new mom I didn't *want* everyone holding my baby. So this pushy thing is just kind foreign to me.", "I think she was so insistent because she\u2019s taken pictures of others with her kid and posted on social media about it. I don\u2019t like pictures that much either so that was definitely a no.", "That's worse. Not everything has to be on social media. She's wrong on two counts."]}
