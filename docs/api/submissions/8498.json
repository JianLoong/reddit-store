He's white and I'm a dark skinned black woman. Our parents were an interracial couple and our family had some unique challenges over the years but our parents did their very best by us and tried their hardest to get us as much information as possible with our birth families. It was a little easier with mine because I was orphaned and I had two older living birth relatives who were just incapable of caring for me and needed care themselves. My brother had a very different story and he had no information at all.\n\nWhen he was 20 he met his wife, they married after two years of dating. She always gave me bad vibes. Around the time they got engaged he told me she kept bringing up his birth family and how he should find them before the wedding. I had told him he didn't have to do anything but he knew mom and dad would help him and he'd have my support. She went behind his back to find him via DNA and it was a shitshow. But for some reason he forgave her and decided to meet the people which she was thrilled about. It was around that time she told me to get lost because he had sisters who were actually related to him and not (you can guess the slur) who always made his life more difficult. She told me I was crazy if I thought I'd be in HER wedding photos. She also said our parents should get used to having only one child. My brother had already started to pull away by then and because I was hurt and angry, I never told him what went down between his now wife and I. I chose to not attend his wedding and I know from our parents that the day was very messy.\n\nSix years of no contact happened and then he reached out and apologized for letting anything come between us. We have been back on speaking terms for over a year now. It took a while but we are doing so much better. I always loved my brother but was hurt by the stuff that went down between us and me and his wife.\n\nA few days ago my brother's family ended up in a shelter. He lost the job he had for many years and took a huge pay cut in the new one at the same time that his former landlord decided to illegally kick them out by changing the locks. My brother did contact a lawyer but nothing is as fast as they show in TV and the movies and they have no place to go. I live in the same city which would allow him to keep what job he has now at least and so he asked if they could stay. I said I would help him and the kids and they could stay. But his wife is not welcome in my home. He told me he would take that which did surprise me some.\n\nHis wife is PISSED. She came after me about separating her children from her and how unhealthy it will be for them to see her in a shithole while they're safe and comfortable with me. She called me all kinds of names like petty and bitchy and an asshole. But it was the comment about the kids that got me questioning.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674893377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10n9w0k/aita_for_telling_my_brother_i_will_help_him_and/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have offered a safe place for the children which as a mother she should be thankful for.", "NTA, tell him what she did and said. I bet you would have wanted your brother to tell you what your spouse said if the roles were reversed. Keeping him in the dark is unfair to him. And of course you are well within your right to refuse to house racists. We should all refuse to house racists.", "NTA and karma something is a cruel mistress tell her you don't want to live under the roof of of a *****(what she called you)", "NTA. She was rude, hurtful and racist towards you. You\u2019re not obliged to help her in any way. Besides, your brother understands and is okay with that. She\u2019s one heck of a psycho fr", "NTA", "NTA. I think you've been taking it easy on her. It's hard to believe you can be silent about things and he doesn't see what an awful person she is, anyway. If I were him, I would want to know everything. Always glad to cut racists out. They are usually horrible people in other ways so being racist just makes it easier to cut ties.", "NTA\n\nI would sit down and talk to your brother about what happened. However, I have a funny feeling that he knows she wronged you in a way. That's probably why he apologized for letting things come between you two. The fact that he accepted the no wife at your house with no opposition situation is very telling. I think it's time to have a heart to heart with him about this.", "NTA and it sounds like the kids will be better off away from her.", "Nah she\u2019s a racist\u2026your brothers ain\u2019t any better but nTA", "With how she reacted, she really showed that she hasn\u2019t changed in the slightest.

It\u2019s not about her being close to support her kids. She thinks SO LOW of you that she truly believes that after everything that happened you still have an obligation to take care of her.

That maybe she's the one who made your brothers life harder after all these years?", "NTA do not budge. Also tell him every single thing she said before they move in. It's essential. Also she doesnt set a foot in your home - he takes the kids elsewhere to visit their mother.  Also you tell him any racism is not tolerated and they will be out - if his wife sends you any more abuse.", "NTA - she is a horrible racist.

I was wondering if it was the same family being mentioned hmmm.", "Because I would have told him, sometimes people don\u2019t want to listen and I wonder if the brother would have listened. I would tell him today that the woman he loves is a racist and that is why she isn\u2019t invited into the home.", ">  I said I would help him and the kids and they could stay. But his wife is not welcome in my home. He told me he would take that which did surprise me some.\n\nGiven the brother took up the offer without arguement, I suspect he already knows exactly what his wife is and her racist attitude to his sister.", "Possibly. Which makes me rather disappointed with the brother.", "He might not have known when thet got married but after they went NC, the wife probably felt more comfortable to share her racist views", "Maybe, or maybe not. The fact that his wife encouraged the distance between sister and the parents kinda sends signals. Granted he may not want to see them or chose to ignore it. Either way ignorance is not an excuse and it\u2019s also an environment you shouldn\u2019t want to bring your kids up in. Especially when he comes from an interracial family - who gave him the best start in life. He should know better and be hyper aware of racism towards his family."]}
