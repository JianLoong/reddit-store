He's white and I'm a dark skinned black woman. Our parents were an interracial couple and our family had some unique challenges over the years but our parents did their very best by us and tried their hardest to get us as much information as possible with our birth families. It was a little easier with mine because I was orphaned and I had two older living birth relatives who were just incapable of caring for me and needed care themselves. My brother had a very different story and he had no information at all.\n\nWhen he was 20 he met his wife, they married after two years of dating. She always gave me bad vibes. Around the time they got engaged he told me she kept bringing up his birth family and how he should find them before the wedding. I had told him he didn't have to do anything but he knew mom and dad would help him and he'd have my support. She went behind his back to find him via DNA and it was a shitshow. But for some reason he forgave her and decided to meet the people which she was thrilled about. It was around that time she told me to get lost because he had sisters who were actually related to him and not (you can guess the slur) who always made his life more difficult. She told me I was crazy if I thought I'd be in HER wedding photos. She also said our parents should get used to having only one child. My brother had already started to pull away by then and because I was hurt and angry, I never told him what went down between his now wife and I. I chose to not attend his wedding and I know from our parents that the day was very messy.\n\nSix years of no contact happened and then he reached out and apologized for letting anything come between us. We have been back on speaking terms for over a year now. It took a while but we are doing so much better. I always loved my brother but was hurt by the stuff that went down between us and me and his wife.\n\nA few days ago my brother's family ended up in a shelter. He lost the job he had for many years and took a huge pay cut in the new one at the same time that his former landlord decided to illegally kick them out by changing the locks. My brother did contact a lawyer but nothing is as fast as they show in TV and the movies and they have no place to go. I live in the same city which would allow him to keep what job he has now at least and so he asked if they could stay. I said I would help him and the kids and they could stay. But his wife is not welcome in my home. He told me he would take that which did surprise me some.\n\nHis wife is PISSED. She came after me about separating her children from her and how unhealthy it will be for them to see her in a shithole while they're safe and comfortable with me. She called me all kinds of names like petty and bitchy and an asshole.

You see, bigots, scammers, con artists and other sleazy characters learn how to manipulate people's minds. They practice early on how to mix in truths, half truths and outright lies to mess up with people's minds and get them to do what they want.\n\nIn this case, \"you shouldn't separate children from their mother\" is a basic principle (I'm remembering Jane Austen's \"it's a truth universally acknowledged\") that most societies accept. But it's not an absolute truth. It's a principle, applicable with a healthy dose of ifs and buts. The reason why CPS and other agencies exist is because of all horror stories of abusive parents. Therefore, it is perfectly possible to separate children from their parents. It depends on the circumstances.\n\nThat woman may be good at keeping her children fed, clean and warm, but her disgusting racism is surely not healthy for their upbringing. Also, she's not going to lose parental rights for a couple days or weeks. Her children won't forget her, she'll have time to get a job or something.\n\nYou're a wonderful sister. Your parents are the best. And your brother... let's hope your brother comes out of the FOG some day. And kicks her to the curb of sad history where she deserves to be. And he gets full custody.\n\nPS: I wonder where her close ring of \"confederate daughters\" is now when they need help", "Well can his birth family not help her out? Lol nta", "NTA but you definitely should tell your brother about the racist behaviour and shitty comments she gave you back then - and now.", "NTA for this situation, but *slightly* YTA for not telling your brother what she said when she said it. If he was unaware of her racism, you just let him marry her blind. You had vital information that he needed to make an informed decision about who he spent his life with, and withheld it.

Maybe she should ask your brother's biological family for help since they are apparently so amazing. You owe her nothing. Your brother at least tried reconnecting to you. And the kids are, like I previously said, innocent to actions committed by their mother, which were committed before they were even born. Letting them stad with you would be understandable.

So many years later and with the help you are now offering to HER CHILDREN, your brother's wife still shows no gratitude and no remorse for her past extremely racist behavior.\n\nYou are not being petty. Instead of weaponizing her children to manipulate you to  HER benefit, your SIL should be thanking you, apologizing, and promising you that she will earn your trust with reformed behavior.
