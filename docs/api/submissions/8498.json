It was a little easier with mine because I was orphaned and I had two older living birth relatives who were just incapable of caring for me and needed care themselves. My brother had a very different story and he had no information at all.\n\nWhen he was 20 he met his wife, they married after two years of dating. She always gave me bad vibes. Around the time they got engaged he told me she kept bringing up his birth family and how he should find them before the wedding. I had told him he didn't have to do anything but he knew mom and dad would help him and he'd have my support. She went behind his back to find him via DNA and it was a shitshow. But for some reason he forgave her and decided to meet the people which she was thrilled about. It was around that time she told me to get lost because he had sisters who were actually related to him and not (you can guess the slur) who always made his life more difficult. She told me I was crazy if I thought I'd be in HER wedding photos. She also said our parents should get used to having only one child. My brother had already started to pull away by then and because I was hurt and angry, I never told him what went down between his now wife and I. I chose to not attend his wedding and I know from our parents that the day was very messy.\n\nSix years of no contact happened and then he reached out and apologized for letting anything come between us.

I always loved my brother but was hurt by the stuff that went down between us and me and his wife.\n\nA few days ago my brother's family ended up in a shelter. He lost the job he had for many years and took a huge pay cut in the new one at the same time that his former landlord decided to illegally kick them out by changing the locks. My brother did contact a lawyer but nothing is as fast as they show in TV and the movies and they have no place to go. I live in the same city which would allow him to keep what job he has now at least and so he asked if they could stay. I said I would help him and the kids and they could stay. But his wife is not welcome in my home. He told me he would take that which did surprise me some.\n\nHis wife is PISSED. She came after me about separating her children from her and how unhealthy it will be for them to see her in a shithole while they're safe and comfortable with me.

They are usually horrible people in other ways so being racist just makes it easier to cut ties.", "NTA\n\nI would sit down and talk to your brother about what happened. However, I have a funny feeling that he knows she wronged you in a way. That's probably why he apologized for letting things come between you two.
