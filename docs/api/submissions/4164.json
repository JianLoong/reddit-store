Needless to say we are all very close and interact with each other on the daily, even hang out outside of work.  \n\nMy, f26, coworker, f45, had a bad experience with last years secret Santa. We had it split into 3 weeks for the last three weeks of December. Week 1- trinket, week 2 - trinket, week 3- final gift, exchange and staff dinner. \n\nHer first two gifts came the following week, which ruined her experience of looking for her gift and waiting for it to appear in the designated week, and she also felt that her final gift was below budget and not thought out (a wallet). As everyone was having their own experience, admittedly we didn\u2019t notice how bad her\u2019s was. \n\nThis year October we selected the names for secret Santa. This is when she told everyone about her experience and how terrible it was, mentioning it multiple times to different people and saying that she does not want to be involved this year. \n\nIn charge, I still put her name in the generator, me and one of the bosses hoping to persuade her as we made a rule in the generator her and her past Santa would not get each other. It did not work. \n\nInstead I asked her to show me who she got, and decided to get the gifts for both her and my original person, without telling her Santa that she was not participating. This was done so that she could still receive a gift , without having to put in the effort.\n\nLate November, after people started buying gifts she made a comment stating that she does not only does she not want to be a part of it but if she gets a gift she will leave it there at work. \n\n There is NO WAY that she would not receive a gift. Either I would have 3 secret Santas, or the bosses would still get her a gift. \n\nIt would be terrible for the next 3 weeks for all to be excited about a surprise gift knowing she\u2019s not involved or receiving. Her past Santa would feel guilty and not be able to enjoy the festivities. We would feel awkward brandishing gifts with her right there. The final brunch would be weird after we closed work to exchange the last gifts.\n\n I understand her stance, but I feel that we should at least be able to make it up to her- stress free on her end, so that everyone can enjoy the festivities . \n\nMy thoughts have even gone as far as thinking she is selfish because she knows how small work is and how it will impact the holiday season. Just accepting the gifts graciously is fine because we are only doing it to make her feel included, and to make up for last year! We aren\u2019t forcing her to buy anyone a gift. \n\nAs her gym partner , and someone who hangs out with her outside of work- I could never receive a gift and be excited to talk to her about it knowing she can\u2019t enjoy it as well- and she\u2019d have 2 bad christmases at work. But maybe I\u2019m being selfish? \n\n\nAm I the asshole for ignoring her wishes and including her anyway?", "created_utc": 1670414005, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zeza77/aita_for_including_my_coworker_in_secret_santa/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This coworker clearly told you they didn\u2019t want to participate in the secret Santa exchange. Instead of listening, you doubled down and created contingencies so that they would participate or their experience would be elevated. How much money have you spent? Why is this so important? I think your mistake was in pushing this on her. Next time, respect her wishes and she may see others enjoying the exchange and want to participate another time. Times are tough and secret Santa exchanges can put pressure on already strained budgets. The key to a good holiday season is not buying the right gift but making memories. Good luck!", "YTA.

Second, instead of simplifying & making it clear that if someone participates they, as Santa, can\u2019t leave their recipient left out, you continue to make this about her non-participation. \nIf you want some type of gift exchange in the office do a themed white elephant on a set day with some refreshments. Only people who want to participate bring a gift, you don\u2019t have to worry someone is left out, and no one has to stress about finding a perfect t gift for a singular person.", "\u201cWe are only doing it to make her feel included\u201d when she does not want to be included. \n\n\u201cI feel that we should at least be able to make it up to her,\u201d but instead you\u2019re going to make her go through the same situation once again.  \n\nShe made her position very clear.

You're doing this for your sake, not her's, so much so that I wonder if you don't like her.\n\nSeriously, you do realise you are so wrong here, on so many different levels, don't you? Do the right thing, respect her wishes and leave her out completely.", "I got lost in the detail in this, my first thought is you all take secret Santa way too seriously.

She has expressed her boundaries, respect it and stop forcing her to get involved. Your workplace sounds toxic and exhausting. Forcing people to spend money on each other when they are just colleagues, during a cost of living crisis, for the sake of \"fun\" is a shitty way to treat employees. Maybe the gift giver last year was non-compliant and untimely, with a poor gift choice, to protest how dumb Secret Santas are for grown adults in a professional environment. If your workplace truly wants to value their employees, then they should stop expecting them to pay out of their own pockets for gifts for non-friends, and the boss can reward good work with a nice Christmas bonus or Amazon gift card...", "YTA\n\nOne of the fastest ways to make a person feel disrespected is exactly what you have done. She very clearly said it made her unhappy, she did not want to participate, but you decided you knew what she wanted better than she did.

Your narcissism is showing.", "YTA she made her stance clear  and you ignored her. If I were her I would involve HR.", "YTA I hope she goes to HR", "YTA. The mental gymnastics you went through, to make her seem like a selfish and bad person are astounding!

Even to paying the extra person this year. \n\nSo clearly this year was a fumble and I\u2019ll just not be doing anything work culture related next year. I stressed myself out all year and still have a lot of growing and learning and maturing to do", "I'd probably hand it to a homeless person.", "What we do for birthdays at our place is have the person whos birthday was before plan and get the cake etc. This way the task is rotated and doesnt fall all on one person. \n\nI think it seems your doing alot of 'social sec' type roles which arent really fair to be lumped all on you. Try to learn to say no. \n\nUnfortunately I do think you are the ah in this situation but I also feel alot of this is because you were pressured into organising stuff like this and so feel pressure to make it 'perfect'. Unfortunately perfection is different for everyone."]}
