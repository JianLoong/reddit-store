I know how that feels as I also had an ex pass and it\u2026was a lot.\n\nNTA. Everyone grieves in their own way. But besides that, you fell asleep, not a big deal. It\u2019s not like you cheated.\n\nBut for him to write your feelings off when you just experienced a loss was a real asshole thing to do. He may be a great guy 364 out of the year but that day, he was a dick.\n\nI\u2019m not the type to tell people \u201che sucks leave him\u201d buuuut he really whipped out a huge red flag by dismissing your feelings during a moment like that.\n\nDevil\u2019s advocate: what if he exploded the way he did because he was concerned for you having been gone so long? Not making excuses but sometimes people express how they feel about something by acting out with completely different actions because they don\u2019t know how to process. Make sense?", "NTA my sweet, you are dealing with grief, shock, and misplaced guilt.  Your bf is so wrong in this.  Grief is exhausting and draining.  Please take care of yourself.", "Your bf is an asshole. Who gets mad about someone\u2019s grief over somebody they once cared and even loved? Wtf! Don\u2019t move back in with him, he\u2019s shown you his true self & it\u2019s not pretty", "I'm going to get downvoted for this, but NAH.\n\nYou've mentioned you've been getting drunk a lot since she died.  You literally went to sleep sitting next to her grave. \n\nI think your bf was worried about you. I think you have been giving your bf cause to worry. \n\nI think you maybe need to go back, talk to your bf, commit to going to see a therapist to talk through your feelings about what's happened, especially your feelings that maybe you were responsible for her death.  If someone I loved were reacting like this over the death of an ex I'd be getting very, very worried about them - especially if it culminated in their literally going to sleep next to their grave on the day of the funeral, and not getting home til after two in the morning.", "YTA", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I hope you are able to process your grief in a safe and healthy place. Take care of yourself!", "NTA.\n\nGrief is a weird thing at the best of times, and this is someone who was a major part of your life. I'd have weird feelings about it if I heard my first girlfriend died and I haven't spoken to her in twenty years.\n\nYour boyfriend is being an ass, but you're both young and maybe he'll grow out of it. (Maybe he won't, and you're not obligated to stick around to find out.)\n\nYour ex's death was not your fault.\n\nThe grief will get easier to handle in time. It may still hit you occasionally, and that's okay too.", "It's very understandable that you're hurt. You're grieving and harbouring what seems like a lot of guilt.\n\nYour partner could have spoken better about this, but (only from the snippets you've shown here) it could be coming from a place of worry that he can't express. He shouldnt have yelled, but coming home at 2am is frightening.\n\nI hope you seek therapy and healing. You can't hold yourself to blame for what happened to her. It *is* terrible that it happened, but you have no idea what was going on that night. \"It's not your fault\" can feel empty to hear, and you won't believe it just because I'm saying it. But I hope you in the very least allow yourself some grace and mercy.\n\nReach out to your people, your family (chosen or otherwise), your support network. Be honest that you're struggling. Talk to someone rather than trying to drink through it.\n\nSending you love.", "NTA - you were with her for 8 years, and you had the missed phone calls. This is how you are grieving. There is no right way to grieve and this is not a wrong way to grieve. If the boyfriend was initially \"mad\" because he was worried and that was how he expressed fear momentarily, then I would understand his reaction. But, to say that you were over reacting in your grief, that is just heartless.", "Oh honey NTA and I am so sorry for your loss. This woman was a huge part of your life for ONE THIRD of it. You aren't going to just \"get over it\" in a day, a week, or a month. Take all the time you need to grieve. If your new boyfriend is that threatened by your previous long-term relationship, it may be time to re-evaluate if he is the type of partner you want.", "You were dealing with grief and fell asleep by mistake. I don\u2019t think your the asshole. I think your boyfriend was mainly just mad that you were gone so long and, likely sense you were asleep, didn\u2019t hear from you for a while. You were with the girl for 8 years and had just broken up, even if you were over her and felt ready for a new relationship, hearing that someone you used to date for so long is suddenly dead is still a \u201cwait what?!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss bud, hope your doing ok.", "NTA. I hope you have other ppl in your life besides your bf that you can lean on for support right now. So sorry for your loss!", "NTA\n\nSorry for your loss. Just because you have broken up with her doesn\u2019t mean those 8 years of memories just disappear. Since this woman was with you for like a third of your life, I\u2019d understand that it would take a long time to grieve considering you still cared about her even though you were over her. Your boyfriend is being an AH. saying that you\u2019re overreacting in your grief. He should be supporting you, not escalating your feelings at this point.", "NTA. Everyone handles death differently. No two people will mourn the same way or in the same amount of time. You do what you need to do for yourself and tell others to just butt-out. You experienced a tragic loss. Don't let anyone tell you you're being ridiculous.", "Sorry for your loss OP.\n\nNTA. You\u2019re allowed to mourn as much as you need. You were dating her for 8 years. That\u2019s a long long time. Even if you broke up. To have her suddenly be killed and be struck with feelings of guilt as a result makes it even worse. I mean you grew up with her presumably. So again makes it even worse. I\u2019m kind of surprised you fell asleep out there but I\u2019m sure it was emotionally and physically exhausting for you and I don\u2019t blame you for it, nor do I think you are somehow overreacting.\n\nHopefully your bf is just feeling insecure and was just worried about you. Obviously that was completely over the line.\n\nIf you feel the need to explain, it should be obvious that even if you are no longer dating someone, you can still be upset when they pass away or worried about them in some way. My mother was divorced from her ex husband for 20+ years and he still attended my fathers funeral to support her. They still had a friendship. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all. \n\nYou can apologize if you want for worrying your bf but I think he should apologize for not being supportive of your feelings and his accusatory remarks.", "I don't know if I can say that it's healthy. Since the funeral I've blown through probably 6 to 8 bottles of teramana tequila. We always used to do tequila shots together and her Mexican family always used to like getting me way too drunk.\n\nTeremana was her favorite. I never liked it much", "This. You have a lot of heavy shit to work through. A therapist will at least listen, and you can work through your thoughts with help.", "Damn I meant what you said but you said it better lol"]}
