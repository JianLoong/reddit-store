My wife (21 F) works full time and studies full time and she does an amazing job. I'm so proud of her and want her to stay comfortable and relaxed through this difficult time because I've been through the same and worse (working 14 hours a day and studying full time as well). \n\nBut here's the thing, I work 2 night shifts a week, so I don't really get to see my wife as much as I want to because I leave at 7 pm and get home by 9 the next day which by then she'd have left for work till 4 then class till 9 pm right after that. So I want to get every chance I can alone with her. The problem is her younger sister (17 F) constantly knocks on our door and walks into our room. Now she knocks, a few weeks ago it would be free waltzing into the room. So whenever my wife and I are having alone time or an important discussion, we're interrupted by her and my wife is okay with it. This happens every day. Every. Single. Night. And other incidents also piss me off but I keep my mouth closed \n\nI've talked to my wife about this multiple times to set boundaries, and it's gotten a bit better (like she waits till we say yes or no, but if it's a no, she asks why why why until we give in and she walks in). My wife says we need to give her attention because she's gone through a tough time before and is sensitive. But I still want no interruptions until I'm done with my time with her. \n\nIt happened last night again and I've had enough. So after getting interrupted, my wife goes to shower and I prepare myself for bed and don't continue the conversation. We say our goodnights and I love you's and go to bed. I know it annoys and upsets my wife that we don't talk before bed, but I get tired. I want my full hours of sleep to make it through the day and night. \n\nMy wife called me out and said I'm being selfish because her sister needs more attention than the other siblings. I think we give her the right amount of attention, and she still wants more. So AITA?\n\nEDIT: We don't have a lock because her dad took them off when they first moved in and lost the keys now...

Your bedroom should be off-limits. Once you two go into it, that is it, no more interaction with the rest of the family.

She could be having a hard time her sister is all grown up now but your wife is enabling this..\n\nIt's absolutely reasonable to want alone time and peace at night after working and to spend time together.", "NTA:\n\nYour wife is fully capable of understanding the situation so that you and her will have more time together. I feel that the sisters interruptions are on purpose consider my that she is 17 and is also fully capable of understanding the situation.  She should be able to stay alone with herself for at least a couple hours. However, I also believe that you and you wife should make more time for each other because time is key in a relationship. If there is no communication, there is no marriage.\n\nSorry if there are any mistakes, I am fairly young.", "NTA. Sister is 17 and obviously knows what she's doing. You need to tell your wife to stop allowing her sister into your room period. Wife needs to take the lead on this", "boundaries are a good thing and while you are with the parents, it's going to be really tough.  NTA for asking and pushing for your time with your wife.  The little sister needs to learn boundaries too.", "NTA.  Get a lock on the door.  Hang a Do Not Disturb sign on the door knob when the two of you are having one on one time together.  That way her sister knows that it isn't a good time to knock.", "NTA\u2026.however, you have a problem with boundaries and you\u2019re not on the same page as your spouse. That needs to be your focus. While moving out will help in that regard, it won\u2019t solve it and your SIL will likely just step on your boundaries in a different way. Of course I don\u2019t know the whole backstory, but getting married so young and without financial stability was probably unwise. Even though I got married pretty young myself (we were both 23), I would never recommend living with parents as newlyweds, in part because it makes boundaries complicated and difficult to enforce.", "NTA - the 17 old needs to learn boundaries.  Have you thought about a lock on the door?  Keeps people out.", "NTA\n\nSIL is 17 yrs old and should know better, plus wife isn't helping by constantly putting sisters needs before any of yours.", "NTA - As long as it stays civil, it's not unreasonable to request alone time.  Maybe your wife doesn't want to say \"no\" to her sister, but maybe she'd be okay if you did.  This sounds like a good place to seek a compassionate compromise among the three of you.  Good luck.", "NTA. You are reasonable for wanting to be able to have private time with your wife without interruption. Particularly when you don't get much anyway. And there are two nights a week where you're not home anyway.\n\nOne way to approach this, using an \"I feel\" statement, might be: \"Every time you interrupt a private conversation we are having because your sister needs attention, I feel that I am less important to you than she is.\". Or a similar statement about how you feel when these things happen.\n\nYour wife may not be meaning to send such a message. But, if your time together always takes a back seat to your SIL then that would sound like the message being sent. She just may not realize it.\n\nBTW, if FIL still has the lock hardware, and it's just the keys that are missing, that's pretty easy to deal with. No need to get new locks. Just take the existing hardware to a locksmith. They can pull out the cylinder and either measure the existing pin settings to cut a key for it or just reset the pins to a new pattern and cut a key to match. Odds are it will be cheaper than a whole new lock.", "It sounds like a door stop would work.  But this is not a technical problem.

But you're the interloper in this living space, and this is a very minor annoyance.\n\nHonestly why did you even get married at your young age if you have to live with someone's parents? That's a recipe for stress and conflict.

You are now married.

Since you chose it, you should prioritize your marriage. If you want it to last, that's a must.\n\nYour FIL is TA, for not immediately letting you get and install a lock, once you moved in as a married couple.\n\nYour SIL is TA for not given you two some space. I don't care if she is sensitive. She's 17, not 7.\n\nYour wife is TA for not prioritizing your marriage either, and it might be a hard adjustment for her to make (or even see that she needs to make), while she's still living in her childhood home.

She should know better. And you can get married for like $150 at a courthouse. My wedding was like $1,000-2,000 total. Not that it ahs anything to do with the question posed."]}
