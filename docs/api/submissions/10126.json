My wife (21 F) works full time and studies full time and she does an amazing job. I'm so proud of her and want her to stay comfortable and relaxed through this difficult time because I've been through the same and worse (working 14 hours a day and studying full time as well). \n\nBut here's the thing, I work 2 night shifts a week, so I don't really get to see my wife as much as I want to because I leave at 7 pm and get home by 9 the next day which by then she'd have left for work till 4 then class till 9 pm right after that. So I want to get every chance I can alone with her. The problem is her younger sister (17 F) constantly knocks on our door and walks into our room. Now she knocks, a few weeks ago it would be free waltzing into the room. So whenever my wife and I are having alone time or an important discussion, we're interrupted by her and my wife is okay with it. This happens every day. Every. Single. Night. And other incidents also piss me off but I keep my mouth closed \n\nI've talked to my wife about this multiple times to set boundaries, and it's gotten a bit better (like she waits till we say yes or no, but if it's a no, she asks why why why until we give in and she walks in). My wife says we need to give her attention because she's gone through a tough time before and is sensitive. But I still want no interruptions until I'm done with my time with her. \n\nIt happened last night again and I've had enough. So after getting interrupted, my wife goes to shower and I prepare myself for bed and don't continue the conversation. We say our goodnights and I love you's and go to bed. I know it annoys and upsets my wife that we don't talk before bed, but I get tired. I want my full hours of sleep to make it through the day and night. \n\nMy wife called me out and said I'm being selfish because her sister needs more attention than the other siblings. I think we give her the right amount of attention, and she still wants more. So AITA?\n\nEDIT: We don't have a lock because her dad took them off when they first moved in and lost the keys now...

Which means his time with her is more limited to than the sister to begin with.\n\nPlus, SIL was previously just walking into their room. Which could have gotten really awkward if they had been in an intimate moment.\n\nNow, she knocks, but does not accept \"No\" for an answer. Which is actually worse, in some respects. And OPs wife is supporting it.\n\nIf anyone is acting entitled here, it is SIL.\n\nI also find it ironic that OPs wife is happy to allow the sister to interrupt them when they're talking privately. But gets upset when after SIL leaves, OP doesn't want to continue talking, because it is late and he wants to sleep. That she's upset because they didn't \"talk before bed\", when that's what they were doing when they got interrupted.\n\nAnd finally, nobody is saying \"slam the door in SILs face\" or \"ignore her completely\". What OP is asking for, and his wife and sister are failing to respect is a boundary that when they're in their room and spending private time together, that they not be interrupted. (Betcha SIL can manage that when it comes to her parents.)\n\nAnd really, how hard would it be for SIL to say to herself \"they've gone to bed, I'll talk to sis tomorrow\" or even before OP and his wife go to bed say \"hey sis can we talk?\"? And why does it have to be older sister every time? Why not mom? Or a friend?\n\nOPs wife should be jealously guarding the limited time they're able to spend together currently, but, as I commented to OP elsewhere, she's sending a message that their time together is less importamt than her time with her sister.\n\nOh, as for \"have patience, it will get better when you move out\"... Really? What makes you think so? If OPs wife is unwilling to protect any of their private time now, what makes you think it will get any better when they're in their own place? That won't stop sister from calling every time she needs her big sister's attention. She might even show up on their doorstep.\n\nIf anything, with the current lack of boundaries, I could see moving out making it worse. The wife may start arguing \"sis doesn't see me every day like you do.\" as further justification for continuing the behavior pattern that has developed and the boundary stomping.\n\nOP, if you see this, remember that point. If good boundaries are not established now, they are unlikely to develop just because you have moved out. You could move hundreds of miles away and still feel like you're in the same place in this respect.", "Ah cool. NTA mb"]}
