Your wife is at risk of turning into a sleep deprived mom-zombie while driving your kids.

They basically sleep 3-4 hours stretches day and night. So it's not just one hour she gets to nap with the baby like comments are suggesting. I've been a stay at home mom with a kid that didn't sleep. After 7 years of being a stay at home mom, I went back to work. My job is physical, manual labor. Trust me, working and then taking care of a child is worse then just being at home with kid whole day. I also just sit down and can't move for 1-2 hours after work. So you people need to dial it down a bit with your attacks. But OP, you also need to work out a better schedule. Take over at 6 but don't get her up at 9. Do the bath and feeding and putting the baby to sleep so she'll have until 9+ that first sleep baby takes. Melatonin for your wife so she can nap during the day when baby sleeps if she can't fall asleep on her own. \nYou should also take over the night feedings when you don't have work the next day.
