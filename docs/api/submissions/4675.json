Your wife is at risk of turning into a sleep deprived mom-zombie while driving your kids.

I've been a stay at home mom with a kid that didn't sleep. After 7 years of being a stay at home mom, I went back to work. My job is physical, manual labor. Trust me, working and then taking care of a child is worse then just being at home with kid whole day. I also just sit down and can't move for 1-2 hours after work. So you people need to dial it down a bit with your attacks. But OP, you also need to work out a better schedule. Take over at 6 but don't get her up at 9. Do the bath and feeding and putting the baby to sleep so she'll have until 9+ that first sleep baby takes. Melatonin for your wife so she can nap during the day when baby sleeps if she can't fall asleep on her own. \nYou should also take over the night feedings when you don't have work the next day.

He\u2019s a police officer and it\u2019s simply not safe for him to be sleep deprived since he\u2019s driving all day and if a crazy call comes out he needs to have a sharp brain to make split second decisions. So I had ALWAYS done night shift and that\u2019s by choice. He would take shifts if I asked but I refuse. But our daughter(second kid) recently went into a sleep regression where she\u2019s up ever 30-45 minutes so we split the night in half. He stays up til midnight with the baby while I sleep. Then from midnight to 6am he sleeps. It gives me the opportunity to get a solid 3-4 hours straight then I handle the rest of the evening and he still gets 6 hours of sleep. That\u2019s enough for him to function at his job. I believe it\u2019s time for you to step up and help care for the baby that you helped create. At least take a shift once per night. But your wife also needs to utilize nap times regardless if it doesn\u2019t feel right because she doesn\u2019t have another child at home during the day so whenever baby naps she can nap. I\u2019ve found putting baby in bed with me for naps helps them nap longer(I know safe sleep hazard but I think you can do it safely for naps) But you guys need to start acting like a team during all of this.

Yes, sleep interruption comes with the job, but she\u2019s not a single parent and it shouldn\u2019t all be on her.  Her running on like 3 hours of a sleep a day is not sustainable long term.

This may be because the baby is essentially using the nipple as a soother when falling asleep. Try introducing an actual soother. We all say we won't do this or that when planning a baby. Life happens and things change. Plans fall apart in the face of reality. \n\nIt's ok to use a soother and it's even ok to stop nursing earlier than planned. If doing things one way isn't working, finding another way is common sense. I'd suggest your wife visit a doctor about her chronic fatigue. Pregnancy and birth take a heck of a toll on a body and she won't have fully recovered yet. Guess what helps a body recover? Sleep! See if the doc has any suggestions. \n\nYTA OP.

Your wife might be a SAHM but on that little sleep it's frightening to think she's caring for another little human, the little human you guys created together, because when people get too little sleep that really rocks them mentally and physically.

You should be shouldering some of that sacrifice too. Not just expecting her to. She will resent you if you keep that up. If you love her and respect her, make that sacrifice and let her get more sleep. It makes so much more difference than you could ever realize without being the one going through it.
