This isnt the first incident ive had with them. Last year a couple of times when i was outside smoking weed and listening to music, one of me neighbour came over and asked me to stop because the child was outside. I said no because weed is legal in this state and im on my own property and they smoke it aswell. So back to the child coming into my yard i asked the parents nicely at first to keep them off my property and away from my dog. They said they would, in a kinda I don\u2019t care type of way. It was fine for about 5 minutes then i had to go into my house to get something. When i came back out a minute later the child was in my yard again chasing my dog. I put my dog inside then went over to the neighbours and said \u201ckeep your crotch goblin out of my yard, and teach it not to chase after other people dogs\u201d. They called me an asshole then went inside with there child. So i wanna know am i the asshole in this situation?\n\nEdit- I understand I shouldn\u2019t have insulted the child i was extremely angry. Also my dog is a pitbull and im his 4th owner he doesnt do well with people chasing him.

The dog has the right to be in the yard to get fresh air and exercise. I wouldn't be surprised if your neighbor is trying to force you to get rid of the dog or move because they are against pit bulls by making it impossible for you to keep him in the yard.
