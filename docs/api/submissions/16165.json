This isnt the first incident ive had with them. Last year a couple of times when i was outside smoking weed and listening to music, one of me neighbour came over and asked me to stop because the child was outside. I said no because weed is legal in this state and im on my own property and they smoke it aswell. So back to the child coming into my yard i asked the parents nicely at first to keep them off my property and away from my dog. They said they would, in a kinda I don\u2019t care type of way. It was fine for about 5 minutes then i had to go into my house to get something. When i came back out a minute later the child was in my yard again chasing my dog. I put my dog inside then went over to the neighbours and said \u201ckeep your crotch goblin out of my yard, and teach it not to chase after other people dogs\u201d. They called me an asshole then went inside with there child. So i wanna know am i the asshole in this situation?\n\nEdit- I understand I shouldn\u2019t have insulted the child i was extremely angry. Also my dog is a pitbull and im his 4th owner he doesnt do well with people chasing him. I don\u2019t have a fence because of the county but he is on a chain.\n\nEdit 2- I didn\u2019t realize i had to explain why my puppy has had 4 owners. So my uncle\u2019s friend had him first who eventually died and my uncle got him who also eventually passed so my grandfather took him and passed away so i have him. He is in no way aggressive unless provoked by a stranger. I shouldn\u2019t have to put my dog down because of that, he has been through more then most of you have. He is only 5. I live with my grandma who needs care. And  finally im looking into bushes and big rocks to put around the yard.\n\nEdit 3- to everyone telling me my dog deserves better. My dog lives a very happy life with me. I bake him doggie treats all the time, take him to the vet, play with him, pet him, feed and water him, hes only on his chain to go the bathroom or if im out there with him. I understand his needs and he understands mine he\u2019s basically my unofficially untrained emotional and physical support dog. And yes i used to joke about how my dog has a curse on his male owner because they die after a year. And the child didnt hear me unless the child has supersonic hearing.", "created_utc": 1682978749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1352t2j/aita_for_telling_my_neighbour_to_keep_her_crotch/", "score": 1193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
