People only learn when there are consequences for their actions.", "NTA having your dog unleashed in a public area is dangerous. It doesn't matter how well the dog is trained, they are animals and sometimes the unexpected happens. Being able to immediately address the issue with leash control is really important. It's also bizarre that he unleashed the dog again after the initial altercation with your dog. A good dog owner would recognize that aggressive reaction and be extra careful around that dog in the future (walking away).", "NTA\n\nHe's lucky if he gets away with just someone shouting at him. Another person might have gone straight to the cops and tried to get his dog put down.", "NTA\n\nThere is a special place in hell for people who let their dog off leash when they know they have an aggressive streak. Keeping the other dogs and people safe is important. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong. What if there had been a child? \n\nLeash rules exist for a reason. Even if the off leash dog isn\u2019t aggressive, there\u2019s no guarantee the dogs it wildly runs up to aren\u2019t aggressive. It\u2019s just not safe.", "Fuck that guy. This time it's your dog but next time it might be someone's kid or grandma.", "NTA that dog should be leashed or muzzled. We have a leash law in our town, but i rarely even want to walk my dogs anymore, as there are often loose dogs, and some of my dogs have been attacked before. One of my dogs is a bully breed, and she would most likely defend herself...it could get ugly fast. My old departed pit bull would usually just pin them down and then let them run off...one little dog came right back at him. I was scared because we were near a playground and i didn't want any little kids to see a bloodbath. I kept yelling at the house for the people to come get their dog, but nobody came out. I would have yelled at the guy like you did, too...and I have. Dog fights are no joke, plus it's kind of an adrenaline dump.", "NTA\n\nIf your dog is dangerous and you don\u2019t leash it then you don\u2019t deserve to have dogs.\n\nWe had a neighbor like that and the dog straight chomped down on our little lady. We were pissed too\u2026", "NTA\n\nPlease call animal control.  The dog attacked your dog and the owner is 90% of the problem because he doesn\u2019t think leash laws apply to him.", "NTA.  Maybe you could've said something to him after the first time, but you can't change that now, and his choices are endangering your dog and everyone else's dogs that live there, and possibly his own as well if it goes after the wrong dog.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My neighbor doesn\u2019t leash his dog and it led to a bite.\"  And this should lead to a police report.", "NTA, please, please report him to animal control, as intentionally, repeatedly loosing a known aggressive biting dog is grounds for a citation at the very least and if he refuses to control the dog it should be taken from him before it seriously injures someone else or their dog.", "Your last line should read, \u201cI feel bad for blowing up at him when his dog bit mine.\u201d You didn\u2019t blow up at him just for breaking the rule but when his breaking the rule led to an attack.\n\nNTA and he deserves any fallout.
