I'd suggest that you speak to them, and tell them exactly how you feel, and make it clear that going forward you will not be around said sibling period.Then focus on finishing school and being independent, and going forward if your sibling ever raises one finger to you , do not hesitate to call the police", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wanna know how I learned it? My wife's mother turned up, similar situation to yours (her sibling is the \"golden child\"). My wife had earlier that day told them she didn't want to hear from them. Her mother turned up. It was raining so after she rang the doorbell for TWENTY MINUTES I let her  in. At which point she became hysterical. It took two police and an ambulance to get rid of her. And then she made up a police report that I'd attacked her. Even though - remember \u2014 it was ME who called the cops. I spent a year in and out of lawyers and police stations trying to clear my name, the stress made me attempt suicide. I now know that her behaviour is called an \"Extinction burst\".

The parents devote a hugely disproportionate amount of effort and attention to the damaged kid. The \"functional\" kid is expected to cope on their own and to basically suck it up. This happens waaaay too often.  Google \"glass child syndrome\" and a lot of your life will start to make sense.  \n\nYour parents have failed you badly, over and over. Moving out was the best thing you ever did. Talk to the university about how you could survive if your parents cut you off financially.  And as soon as you can possibly cut them out of your life totally, do so. Good luck.", ">  I just read your history\n\nsweet jesus.
