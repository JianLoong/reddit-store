Finally I show up unannounced and my niece lets me in, then excitedly ask me, \u201cwanna see our new kitty?\u201d I say yes, and she shows me an exact identical cat, of mine. Definitely my cat. I call my cat by it\u2019s name and she came running to me. The only difference between the cats were someone did a horrible job shaving this one\u2019s face (it\u2019s long haired) My sister came in yelling that I couldn\u2019t just walk in her house (even though I\u2019ve done it a million and one times before.) I told her I wanted my cat back, and she denied it being mine.\n\nI went home and did a lot of research and was looking into lawyers, and evidence I needed. I then texted my sister today (I lied) and said I had a lawyer and I would be taking her to court for stealing my cat.

What's she going to do?  Call the police?

I doubt this issue would ever end up in a court room.", "Did you have the cat chipped?   That would be all the proof you need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnybody who owns a cat or dog and does NOT have them chipped is making a big mistake.", "NTA. If you're sure it's yours report it stolen. Though frankly even with photos etc unless the animal is chipped then you're likely out of luck.\n\nLong and short of it, your sister stole from you. Report the theft.

I hope you can get your cat back :( Do whatever you need to do!", "NTA. If the cat is in fact not yours, she will have evidence of getting it, and she'll bring it to court. Easy solution.", "You left the cat there? The poor cat. Go get her with the police. DO you have records? Photos? Bet she doesn't have adoption records. \n\nYou are only TA if you don't get your cat back.", "NTA. She\u2019d be lucky if that\u2019s all you did because if someone stole my cat and then had the audacity to try and play me like a fool to my face like I wouldn\u2019t recognize my own damn cat, I\u2019m catching charges.", "People need to microchip their pets. also the relationship or legal sub may be better for this.", "NTA\n\n\nSorry your sister is such a raging AH OP.", "Go to the police and file a report.

Find your micro chip or vet paperwork and texts about your sister agreeing to take care of your cat and then saying it died. Take it to the cops. When they show up at her house and give her the choice of returning your cat or getting arrested for theft of property she'll give the cat back. Then never let your sister in your house again.", "NTA. \n\nAt worst, you are the victim of extreme coincidence. Your sister should be able to clear this up swiftly, either producing receipts or papers. If she rescued the cat herself, she should have taken it to the vet before letting her young child with it. There should be evidence to support her story. \n\nBut, you know what your cat looks like. An owner can distinguish between at cat and a cat-that-has-similar-features. If you are certain, then that's that, you have no reason not to believe yourself, that you are not the victim of coincidence but more likely of theft. \n\nHopefully your critter has been microchipped, or perhaps you have other vet records to lend more legitimacy to your claim. \n\nFamily doesn't get a moral freebie.", "I'd bust in there and take my dang cat back.

Call the cops and/or take her to small claims. If that's outside your budget, steal it back.

Like bury it in the backyard or have it cremated at the vet?", "Report your cat stolen as well as filing a report with shelters.\n\nIf you have documentation of taking your cat to the vet who often take photos of the animals for their files, this will help prove ownership. If microchipped, slam dunk.\n\nGo to your sister's, with your documentation in case she calls the police, and get your cat back. Then never speak to her again.", "NTA", "NTA steal if back girl", "NTA but you likely won't get the cat back even if you sue and win. Cats are property. The most a court is likely to award you is the cash value of the cat. If it's not an expensive breed, you're likely to be awarded $100 or less, and she'll still have the cat.\n\nShe stole your fur baby. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't be worried about whether she might forgive me for taking my cat back. I would just take the cat and be done with it.", "NTA\n\nIMO though showing up unannounced and coming inside the house without her permission was wrong. If you had a suspicion that she stole your cat, it would have been better to confront her about it first, then maybe filing a report. I think its crazy she told you that it got hit by a car.", "NTA\n\nBut are you sure it's your cat? \n\nStealing a cat for a sibling you have contact with is just stupid (not that stealing cats from strangers are ok). Talk again with your sister and give her a chance to clear things out.\n\nI'm not saying you're delusional, this just remember me a vase from a Patient, but with a Dog, it weren't siblings but neighbors. The lost of the dog impacted so much my patient, that she started believing the neighbors stole her dog, the dog had a chip and was easy to prove it was the neighbors dog.
