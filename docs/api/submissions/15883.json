It has been a crazy whirlwind experience for us. I am a childhood cancer survivor who was told I was infertile due to the treatment I received. My husband and I spent many years trying for a baby anyway with no success. We also started to save money for IVF to see if there was any hope for us to conceive. We had gotten close to our goal when I learned I was pregnant. My doctors were surprised because they knew I had tried and knew the treatment I went through means it's so rare to get pregnant at all, let alone naturally. To learn it was twins was an even bigger surprise. Someone we know suggested that not actively trying and focusing on other things might have allowed my body to let it happen. I'm not sure. But we were grateful for the chance to be parents to these babies. Even with a complicated pregnancy I felt like I had won the lottery and the fact I was able to deliver two healthy babies is incredible to me given everything.\n\nThe problem is my ILs. My husband is an only child because MIL suffered a placental abruption when she was 34 weeks pregnant and it required an emergency c-section and my husband being born early. Their side is big on honor names so he has four names, all after his four grandparents (exact names of his grandfathers and male variants of his grandmothers names). My ILs were expecting us to do the same, and thought it would be even easier for us since we had twins, and we had a boy and a girl. But we wanted to give our kids their own names. We wanted them to have names we love and chose for them. So we named them Caelan (our boy who also has a nod to the Irish side of my family) and Summer (a nod to my husband and myself and our anniversaries, both of first meeting and marrying). We waited until the babies were born to announce the names and my husband received many calls from his parents afterward, saying that they were hurt we chose not to honor them and how could we give the only children we will ever have random names instead of loving family names. It has been pretty consistent.\n\nMy husband went out to buy groceries for us the other day and I was home alone with the babies when my ILs called me to bring the topic up to me for the first time. They asked how I could name our miracle babies anything but the names of their four loving grandparents and did I not care about the fact these would be their only grandchildren ever. I told them they should appreciate having grandkids, given the circumstances, instead of acting insulted that we didn't name them after them. I told them these babies were a huge surprise but we loved and wanted and they should enjoy them now that we have them. They told me I couldn't just dismiss their feelings like that and hung up...they told my husband I insulted them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682679080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131o85o/aita_for_telling_my_ils_that_they_should/", "score": 4599, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Selfish.\n\n*I told them they should appreciate having grandkids, given the circumstances, instead of acting insulted that we didn't name them after them.

You didn't do anything wrong.**\n\n*They told me I couldn't just dismiss their feelings like that and hung up...they told my husband I insulted them.*\n\n**They consider not getting their demands complied with as being insulting?**  Wow.  **The entitlement is strong** with these two.  \n\nYou absolutely can dismiss their feelings like that.  **Their feelings about this are unreasonable and entitled,** crossing all kinds of lines that shouldn't be crossed,  expecting that you will give over your parental rights to them.

I'd have at least one adult per child with you when they visit, so that you can use bathrooms and such and not have the ILs have unsupervised time.

I had a difficult father at my first parent-teacher conference who was literally screaming at me for giving his kid a B in choir (note:  that kid would have failed my class now since she had to be removed almost every day and eventually had to be removed from the program.  That B was way too generous. I was your typical too-soft first year teacher.)\n\nMy principal pulled me aside and said, \u201cCPSue, you are going to have times when a parent is going to be upset about something that has happened in your classroom.  Sometimes you have a collaborative conversation in which you will work together to find a solution, usually meeting in the middle.  Other times, you need to take stand for whatever reason\u2014classroom policy, school or district policy, or perhaps their expectations are unreasonable.  In those situations, invite them to share their thoughts with you.\n\nHere\u2019s how this is going to go:  Ask them to talk first.  You\u2019re going to listen and not respond, no matter what.  You maintain eye contact. You may make noncommittal noises that show you\u2019re listening.   When it looks as if they are winding down, you ask if there\u2019s anything else they\u2019d like you to know, and you repeat this process until they are sure they\u2019ve said everything they want to say.\n\nThen you firmly, but politely, tell them how it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nIn 34 years of teaching, I never lost a parent in tough discussions.  They felt heard, and I calmly told them the reasons why it was going to be the way it was.  Occasionally, I slightly modified something if I could, but there were also times  I absolutely could not change the policy or alter what I was doing.  Once, it took an hour and a half of my time to talk down a very upset parent, but she eventually got there (and ended up being one of my biggest supporters later.). I\u2019d listen, tell them why I wasn\u2019t going to do what they wanted, listen again if necessary, and reiterate that I understood they disagreed, but this wasn\u2019t going to change (I also had a number of times when they understood my reasoning after they\u2019d had a chance to share and I responded with my reasons for why they weren\u2019t going to get that they wanted.). Often, we agreed to disagree and move on.  BTW, I frequently used this strategy with students as well.\n\nSounds like it\u2019s time for you and your husband to sit down with his parents, listen to everything they have to say, all of the grievances, the hurt feeling, etc.  Put your sympathetic game face on and listen until they run out of words.  Then tell them that while you love them and recognize they feel hurt about your decision, these are your reasons for why you made this decision (list them\u2014if they try to interrupt, remind them they had their turn), your reasons are not up for debate as you are the parents and this decision belongs to you alone, your decision is final and you won\u2019t be discussing this any further.  Then disengage and refuse to have the conversation again.\n\n(The rest of the story of the kid who got the B and was eventually kicked out:  About a month after she got kicked out of choir for constantly destroying the rehearsals, she and her friends were busted at a drug, alcohol, and sex-fueled party (they were all 9th graders), and the dad who screamed at me because he was sure his daughter was an innocent victim got to deal with the reality that his kid was seriously messed up.  Now I look back and realize that the signs she was high in my class every day were right there, but I was a 22-year old sheltered first year teacher.  I didn\u2019t recognize the signs.

I mean, someone is informing you, they aren\u2019t asking your opinion ( unless they actually say, \u201cWhat do you think of . . .\u201d) I was even more surprised to learn that backlash is rather common. I just assumed everyone knew that the parents are the only ones whose opinion matters. Silly me. That was decades ago but I\u2019ve never forgotten.", "\"Babies should not have old lady names, Ursula.\"", "Do people scream and shout? I hate that!", "OH AMEN!!!!   My late wife and I moved 4 states away from her parents and a few hours away from my mom who I am extremely LC now.", "Or random made up names, like Arnold and Ursula. That has a nice ring to it, in my opinion.", "I'm 42 years old why is that shit so funny \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80"]}
