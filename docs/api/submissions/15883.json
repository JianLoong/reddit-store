It has been a crazy whirlwind experience for us. I am a childhood cancer survivor who was told I was infertile due to the treatment I received. My husband and I spent many years trying for a baby anyway with no success. We also started to save money for IVF to see if there was any hope for us to conceive. We had gotten close to our goal when I learned I was pregnant. My doctors were surprised because they knew I had tried and knew the treatment I went through means it's so rare to get pregnant at all, let alone naturally. To learn it was twins was an even bigger surprise. Someone we know suggested that not actively trying and focusing on other things might have allowed my body to let it happen. I'm not sure. But we were grateful for the chance to be parents to these babies. Even with a complicated pregnancy I felt like I had won the lottery and the fact I was able to deliver two healthy babies is incredible to me given everything.\n\nThe problem is my ILs. My husband is an only child because MIL suffered a placental abruption when she was 34 weeks pregnant and it required an emergency c-section and my husband being born early. Their side is big on honor names so he has four names, all after his four grandparents (exact names of his grandfathers and male variants of his grandmothers names). My ILs were expecting us to do the same, and thought it would be even easier for us since we had twins, and we had a boy and a girl. But we wanted to give our kids their own names. We wanted them to have names we love and chose for them. So we named them Caelan (our boy who also has a nod to the Irish side of my family) and Summer (a nod to my husband and myself and our anniversaries, both of first meeting and marrying). We waited until the babies were born to announce the names and my husband received many calls from his parents afterward, saying that they were hurt we chose not to honor them and how could we give the only children we will ever have random names instead of loving family names. It has been pretty consistent.\n\nMy husband went out to buy groceries for us the other day and I was home alone with the babies when my ILs called me to bring the topic up to me for the first time. They asked how I could name our miracle babies anything but the names of their four loving grandparents and did I not care about the fact these would be their only grandchildren ever. I told them they should appreciate having grandkids, given the circumstances, instead of acting insulted that we didn't name them after them. I told them these babies were a huge surprise but we loved and wanted and they should enjoy them now that we have them. They told me I couldn't just dismiss their feelings like that and hung up...they told my husband I insulted them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682679080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131o85o/aita_for_telling_my_ils_that_they_should/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They really need to get over themselves. The title sums it up beautifully.\n\n>They told me I couldn't just dismiss their feelings like that and hung up\n\nYes you can. This is nonsense.", "NTA obviously, and congratulations! Let them talk, they're just moving air. Enjoy those precious but quick moments (I have my 2 months old sleeping on me atm) and let hubby handles his parents.\n\nMoreover, who would want to name their babies after people that entitled, and selfish enough to annoy you 2 weeks into postpartum?", "NTA. You are totally correct in that they should be happy both babies are healthy and loved. The names are lovely btw.", "NTA. Just because your in law's named your husband Joe Josephine George Georgina Bucket doesn't mean you two have any obligation to do similar with your own two bubs.\n\nCongratulations on your twins, and well done picking such lovely names.", "NTA. No one has the right to tell you what to name your children. But because of family tradition, they have had these expectations in their minds.  First, your husband is the one who needs to handle his parents.  Second, it needs to be explained to them that you named your children for the reasons in your post.  It was not a statement against them.\n\nAnd congratulations to you both!", "NTA\n\nEven your husband didn\u2019t want to name them after grandparents\u2026\n\nThey seem very selfish as the only thing they care about is \u201clegacy\u201d and \u201ctradition\u201d - instead of being happy for this miracle that happen for whole family.", "NTA \\~ Congratulations!! Beautifull names!  \nThey will now sabotage your relationship with your husband by telling lies, shows their real face. I hope your husband will be at your side and not be manipulated by them.  \nHorrible family.", "NTA. Congratulations on your babies. I am stunned that the ILs can\u2019t just be happy.", "Nta and you need to have a serious talk with your husband about how he needs to shut this down, since it's his parents. You also need to be careful that these people don't start calling your kids by the wrong name as they get older. I've read stories on here about that happening, and the best thing for everyone at that point was no contact.", "NTA. Congrats on the babies!

No one else.", "NTA.   \nTheir entitlement is astonishing.\n\nGo LC, and see if they start appreciating their grandchildren.", "NTA and congrats on your miracle babies! It's their tradition... doesn't mean it's you and your husbands. New families have a way of making their own traditions.

Unless there was some immaculate conception thingy going on that is.", "NTA, and you are exactly right. I don't mean to sound morbid, but I have relatives in my extended family who have lost children or suffered late pregnancy loss. It infuriates me when people like your ILs want to start stupid fights and introduce unnecessary strife into what SHOULD be a joyful time for the family. Imagine having such a ridiculous ego that you can only see the negatives in having healthy newborn grandbabies!!\n\nAnyway, you and your husband seem to be handling this well, but I think you've got to stop entertaining the discussion. Your babies' names require the approval of you and your husband only, not a committee vote. I think it's time to start hanging up the phone or ending visits as soon as they start in on the name issue. \"Mom, Dad, we've made it clear our decision is final and we're not discussing this further. If you can't move on to a different topic, I'm going to have to end this call/visit.\" I know that's kind of ruthless way to speak to your own parents/ILs, but I think entertaining the discussion just makes them think they have a right to try to \"negotiate\" the babies' names with you. Cut it off, make it clear the topic is closed and not up for discussion. Hopefully, once they realize they are getting nowhere, they will get over it.", "2 healthy little poppets! Congratulations!", "Nta. Your kids. Naming them is upto you and your husband. Not them.", "Also my petty ass immediately thought \u201cif you did ever end up pregnant again/chose to have any other in any way, please name it only after your parents\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nYour inlaws are a bunch of entitled aholes and you\u2019re right, they should be happy to have grandkids.", "NTA your kids, you and husband name them.", "NTA. Your kids, your decision. \n\nI'm actually in the process of changing my middle and last names. I do not have any relationship with my family, and my dad gave me a family member's middle name, and I've ALWAYS hated it. Stupid old person name \ud83d\ude21\n\nAnyways, if it was me, I'd just say I considered it, but decided against it. You don't need to explain any further. They will get over it if they want a relationship with those kids. If not...I don't think your kids would be missing out that much... \n\nTime does tend to heal these kinds of wounds. Maybe just let them be angry, don't feed into it, and move on...\n\nI'm sorry OP but I am definitely on your side here!", "NTA.

The second paragraph I spent with a look of total bewilderment on my face. The entitlement of your in laws!!! You chose gorgeous names by the way, I hope you  and your little babies have a wonderful life together.", "NTA. Honour names are so weird, and the entitlement is through the roof.", "NTA, what raging jerks. Not only can they not put aside their values (I use the term very loosely here) and hurt feelings but they also are bombarding BOTH of you with them?! With newborn twins? They clearly care more about the imagery of the whole situation than the kids themselves. My in laws are like this, we are NC but they like to pretend all is well with their son and with our son and will steal pictures from him if they can find them and print them out so it seems like they\u2019re involved grandparents with him. They did it with all their sons, just wanted to LOOK like good parents instead of being them, only ever actually worried about themselves. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry they are adding stress to something that\u2019s supposed to be amazing for your family. \n\nI hope if they bring it up again you say something similar until they get the message.", "NTA \n\nI mean, they are your kids and you get to name them. Your husband presumably knew how big of a deal this was to his parents, so he should have covered it with them. His parents feelings are hurt and he needs to address it so they quit taking it out on you.", "NTA personally I never liked the idea to name children after living (or dead) grandparents/relatives. Unless there is some big sentimental value to it and not just \u2018we already did it this way and so let\u2019s go on. That said to each it\u2019s own and to you your OWN decision on how naming your children.", "NTA", "NTA, though maybe a bit on how you spoke to them. But I can imagine this was a pure response to a hostile attack. So, still a NTA. \n\nYou have no obligation to name the kids after anyone. You chose great names and they will learn to love and accept them. Maybe, when you're ready, please consider talking to them. They will be in your kids life for a long time.", "ESH.\n\nYou for telling them to \"appreciate\" their grandkids, no one is owed to appreciate any one, if they grow up to be decent human beings and add value to the grandparents life they will be naturally appreciated.\n\nThem for being nosy, when the name of the child has nothing to do with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
