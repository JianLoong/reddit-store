It has been a crazy whirlwind experience for us. I am a childhood cancer survivor who was told I was infertile due to the treatment I received. My husband and I spent many years trying for a baby anyway with no success. We also started to save money for IVF to see if there was any hope for us to conceive. We had gotten close to our goal when I learned I was pregnant. My doctors were surprised because they knew I had tried and knew the treatment I went through means it's so rare to get pregnant at all, let alone naturally. To learn it was twins was an even bigger surprise. Someone we know suggested that not actively trying and focusing on other things might have allowed my body to let it happen. I'm not sure. But we were grateful for the chance to be parents to these babies. Even with a complicated pregnancy I felt like I had won the lottery and the fact I was able to deliver two healthy babies is incredible to me given everything.\n\nThe problem is my ILs. My husband is an only child because MIL suffered a placental abruption when she was 34 weeks pregnant and it required an emergency c-section and my husband being born early. Their side is big on honor names so he has four names, all after his four grandparents (exact names of his grandfathers and male variants of his grandmothers names). My ILs were expecting us to do the same, and thought it would be even easier for us since we had twins, and we had a boy and a girl. But we wanted to give our kids their own names. We wanted them to have names we love and chose for them. So we named them Caelan (our boy who also has a nod to the Irish side of my family) and Summer (a nod to my husband and myself and our anniversaries, both of first meeting and marrying). We waited until the babies were born to announce the names and my husband received many calls from his parents afterward, saying that they were hurt we chose not to honor them and how could we give the only children we will ever have random names instead of loving family names. It has been pretty consistent.\n\nMy husband went out to buy groceries for us the other day and I was home alone with the babies when my ILs called me to bring the topic up to me for the first time. They asked how I could name our miracle babies anything but the names of their four loving grandparents and did I not care about the fact these would be their only grandchildren ever. I told them they should appreciate having grandkids, given the circumstances, instead of acting insulted that we didn't name them after them. I told them these babies were a huge surprise but we loved and wanted and they should enjoy them now that we have them. They told me I couldn't just dismiss their feelings like that and hung up...they told my husband I insulted them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682679080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131o85o/aita_for_telling_my_ils_that_they_should/", "score": 823, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
