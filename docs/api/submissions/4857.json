You gave plenty of notice not to attend, so it's OK not to go but let's face it, this won't traumatised your 3 months old who let's face it is more interesting in eating and sleeping.

Same as being someones friend doesn't automatically give you the title of spouse, same as just being adopted doesn't give you the title of sibling, same as just being bossy doesn't give you the title of boss.

My other sister also sees him as her dad, despite her bio dad being around for her whole life (he just sucked).

It\u2019s good that you stick up for them but unless they see it they will just believe what they are blamed for- that their fighting calling everyone by specific names means you won\u2019t be there at christmas.

I had some trauma going through something similar. These kids need therapy, and understanding\u2026not a replacement family shoved down their throats.

My dad died when I was young.  My mother remarried many years later.  His name was \"J\", and I called him Papa \"J\".  He was a big part of my life and family and calling him by his name didn't feel right, but it was never even a thought to call him dad.  I had a dad and he was amazing and no matter who the \"new\" person in the family was, I wouldn't have called him \"dad\".

I don\u2019t know how long your brother\u2019s been with his wife and her kids but he doesn\u2019t suddenly get dad rights. There are kids who will never call stepparents \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d and that\u2019s perfectly fine. They still miss their dad and will probably never stop missing him.

He had no right to force the issue and should\u2019ve got to know the children first. \n\nI would ask him why he doesn\u2019t care about that what the children want?

You could stand to be ruder and more judgmental tbh.\n\nThey should be horrified at their behavior and the damage they are causing those kids.

This sub is filled with horror stories from that exact situation. If your brother and parents hadn't of been so pushy about it and just let a relationship form naturally those kids may have developed a loving relationship and one day truly thought of him as their dad.
