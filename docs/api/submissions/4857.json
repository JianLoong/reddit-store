You gave plenty of notice not to attend, so it's OK not to go but let's face it, this won't traumatised your 3 months old who let's face it is more interesting in eating and sleeping.

Same as being someones friend doesn't automatically give you the title of spouse, same as just being adopted doesn't give you the title of sibling, same as just being bossy doesn't give you the title of boss.

My other sister also sees him as her dad, despite her bio dad being around for her whole life (he just sucked).

It\u2019s good that you stick up for them but unless they see it they will just believe what they are blamed for- that their fighting calling everyone by specific names means you won\u2019t be there at christmas.

I had some trauma going through something similar. These kids need therapy, and understanding\u2026not a replacement family shoved down their throats.

My dad died when I was young.  My mother remarried many years later.  His name was \"J\", and I called him Papa \"J\".  He was a big part of my life and family and calling him by his name didn't feel right, but it was never even a thought to call him dad.  I had a dad and he was amazing and no matter who the \"new\" person in the family was, I wouldn't have called him \"dad\".

There are kids who will never call stepparents \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d and that\u2019s perfectly fine. They still miss their dad and will probably never stop missing him.

You LET THE CHILDREN decide if he will be OUR NEW DAD, who should NEVER try to take away the memory of THEIR REAL DAD.", "You are so NTA, this is the first year as a father and important time for you and wife. There us nothing wrong with wanting a quiet Christmas.\n\nI\u2019m sorry but your parents and brother have created this situation in attempting forcing the kids to call him dad and been seen as grandparents and like new cousins. It may come from good place, but it is actually hurting the kids. \n\nThey obviously remember their father and as such, he can\u2019t be replaced whether alive or dead. The kids are saying how they feel, they need to go at kids pace and they should be listened to. If your brother and parents didn\u2019t force it, there would not be these issues and it\u2019s more likely to cause estrangement later on, rather positive blended family.\n\nYou have clearly stated the reasons, as for your parents comment about being rude and judgmental and welcoming the kids, actually you are doing the opposite and resort acting their wishes and feelings. It\u2019s them who are being rude and disrespectful to the kids snd their dad", "NTA. Your brother,his wife and your parents  sure are.  AITA will be getting a letter in about 7 years  from the oldest step-child \"AITA for Ghosting my abusive step-father and enabling mother\"  I feel so bad for those kids.  The kids need to make the decision to calll him Dad. They need to decide who they call Aunt,Uncle,Grandparents.  IF your parents truly accepted them they would respect those kids decisions.  I see all three kids going NC with their mother and step-father in the future.", "The regretful thing (apart from the whole deal) is that that there won\u2019t be any keeping the channels of communication open, at the very least so those kids know they could have a safe space with you if they so chose. That they can be themselves and speak their minds without fear of reprimand.\n\nBut whatever you decide, you are NTA. It is totally okay not to want to engage.", "NTA", "NTA. You can not, I repeat, CAN NOT! Force a kid to call you anything they don't want without long last resentment coming from it. The fact their mother is completely ok with all of this going on is absolutely atrocious. Your brother just popping in and going: Call me daddy! Makes him an ass, your family not only agreeing with it, but trying to force it onto children who are literally telling them no, we don't want this. Makes them a bigger asshole. If this keeps up those kids are going to have a lot of what could have been preventable issues because your family is fucked up.", "NTA. You are being VERY accepting of them by allowing their feelings for your family to come naturally rather than forcing them. Everyone needs to back off with the pushing. You are a good step-uncle.", "NTA. Your wisdom in this situation unfortunately is being ignored. You can't really force these sort of things on kids who have their minds made up. You are right to avoid exposing your kid to this show.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to those kids. Your brother and his wife should let nature take its course, and the situation will evolve organically. Forcing this is only going to turn those kids against your brother. Your parents need to chill, too, and give those kids respect.", "They're trying to erase every part of these kids' dead dad and honestly have no idea why the kids are so resistant. Insanity.", "Right! And they don't understand why the kids are so resistant to having their father *completely erased.*\n\nWhat do you want to bet all the pictures at home are gone, too? To \"move on.\" Those poor kids.", "Maybe offer to babysit while they have date nights. You could let the kids know you feel for them and think this behavior is wrong. I'd also recommend asking them what they remember about their father. I'm gonna take a wild guess that no one asks them about their dad.  Sometimes just talking about it other than to each other can be very comforting.\n\nEDIT: Obviously NTA", "The mom and brother seem pretty content to act like the kids never had a family before this, so if op framed it as grief counseling to get past the bio dads death and accept new dad they would likely be in board. Anything to make it easier to shove the kids in the happy family mold", "NTA. And wow, your family is a bunch of abusive pricks who in a few short years will realize that the problem will solve itself because those three kids will go NC with all of them the second they turn 18 yo.", "NTA - You are correct. The kids should decide if they want to call your brother \"Dad\" and your parents \"grandpa\" and \"gandma\" etc. The older kids would for sure have memories of their biological father. They are now being told that their biological father doesn't matter...which isn't right. I get that your brother and family may now want to play a role in the kids life, but they need to respect the fact they had a father that died and they may still be grieving.\n\nThe funny thing is, they are going to just resent your family more because of this. They probably would of been much more accepting of your brother and your family if they were left alone and were able to make the choice for themselves...so what if they never choose to call your brother dad...that wouldn't of meant they wouldn't of loved him and viewed him as a role model...I mean they won't now...they are only going to view him as the guy who said there really father never mattered.", "NTA they need reality shoved down their throats. Those poor kids.", "NTA, but wow, a lot of step-parents suck, guess there's a reason for the cliche.", "We have to wonder what impulses are behind this. Usually we have a widow with kids, and she's inclined to think that any man who looks twice at her is any port in a storm. So they get married, and here's a grown male with another man's son living in his house, and we can't have that. So there is a ton of pressure on the boy to, basically, forget that he's the son of another man. \n\n(Here's a problem that goes back to the ancients, although in the Greek literature the adult man would have killed the dead father.)\n\nThe setup is doomed from the start. I certainly see examples in my family and community. If you remember Bill Clinton, he was born William Jefferson Blythe, and his birth father disappeared. Mr Clinton married the widow, adopted little Billy, and fathered his own son Roger, who was a total loser. Mr Clinton beat up on little Billy a lot. President Gerald Ford\"s birth father died, his mother remarried, and the new husband changed little Leslie's name to Gerald Ford, Jr. Somewhere in there is a nice, please-the-wife impulse, but jeez, it gets perverted.", "NTA at all. Good for you for reading the energy and responding like an adult.", "NTA  thank goodness those kids have someone who can empathize with them. Obviously even their own mother isn\u2019t.", "What would be in this for them? A miserable Christmas?", "I think most of the time the mother loves the kids, but they'd be in the street without this guy rescuing them. She forces the kids to do what they need to do so they don't threaten the new husband by reminding him that this other guy used to sleep with his wife. It's really primitive, these motivations.", "We get letters about this stuff, from the affected children, a lot. Generally when they reach high school age. And yes, they are miserable, have a ton of unresolved grief, and the rage, OMG. Out the door at 18!", "Last names, probably, not first.", "Lots of people in this country have(some) therapy included in their insurance coverage. In the eyes of corporate America, his brother's step kids might as well be Martians because they wouldn't be coverable by his insurance. So OP would have to pay the uninsured rate for these benefits, which would be high. He'd have to be rich to afford such a gift!", "Hey mom and dad.  You know how I'm telling you that you need to change how you are treating the kids and it's not right.  And you just keep arguing and fighting back with me no matter what I say, I can't change your mind.  You just keep digging your heel into the ground refusing to give up any ground.  Right? Well guess what these kids are doing. The exact same thing. You aren't going to change their minds by force. You can only change their minds by being the kind of people that they want to be associated with period.  The more you try to force them into doing what YOU want, the more they are going to dig their heels into the ground and be defiant.  So if you want them to respect you, you first must respect them period.\n\nNTA", "NTA! Those poor kids will never accept your brother as their \u201cdad\u201d after the trauma your family put them through!! \n\nBest to stay out of it!", "You, your wife, and the kids are the only ones who aren't AHs here.  Those kids had a dad and lost him.  No one else will ever be their dad unless the kids decide to gift him that title.  My cousin \"Joe\" married \"Jane,\" who had a son, \"Jake.\" Joe's mom told Jake he could call her whatever he wanted as long as it was respectful.  Jake called her by her first name until Joe and Jane married.  Joe wanted desperately to adopt Jake, but Joe's mom told him to take it slow and easy and not to raise the issue, that it should be a decision that Jake made.  Six months after Joe and Jane married, Jake shyly asked if Joe would adopt him.  Joe was over the moon and Jake was thrilled because he'd never had a dad of his own before. The day the adoption papers were signed, Joe became \"Dad\" and Joe's mom became grandma, titles they both proudly wear today, even though Joe and Jane are separated after over 20 years of marriage.  Kids need time to adjust, especially to a major change like the death of a parent.  The adults who are pushing for your brother to be \"Dad\" are the AHs here.  They will only make those kids resent your brother (and everyone else pushing them) all the more.  The adults need to spend some time with a family therapist in order to understand the dynamic they are creating here.", "NTA. Your son is lucky he has a dad like you.", "NTA You are being judgemental? Me thinks they protest too much", "NTA. Though those kids could use an advocate like you in their corner to speak for them to the rest of your family.", "Frankly it's already been years of it so it's probably too late to mend what they broke. He should still stop it, of course, but he's already irreparably damaged his relationship with those kids", "Because the pushiness was about a particular situation to do with the stepkids and the want to erase their dad from their lives.  It may not extend to the OP's kids.\n\nBut if you read the rest of what I wrote, I said that it does sound like the parents have issues and that the kids may be better off not being exposed to their grandparents because there sounds like there is more to the story.", "Parents have to consent for minors. This would not work.", "NTA. \nI just don't get it. I don't get how people think they're going to force a familial bond. It either happens, or it does not.  \nYour brother cannot tell these kids that he's Dad 2.0. It does not work that way, and all it's going to do is cause resentment.", "NTA. \n\nOut of all the things you\u2019ve chronicled, I can\u2019t get over the fact your brother had a conversation with you and your family about changing his step-kids names.  While they were already 5, 7 & 8!", "NTA. Definitely need to keep your family away from that lunacy.", "I hope so. But even still, it should be up to them.\n\nAlso...if they're in the US, the kids *can't* be adopted without their consent, above a certain age (most states anyway, I'm not positive about all.) Changing their names, I'd think, would face similar legal difficulties if they aren't legally adopted.", "**NTA** \\- I think that you and your nuclear family are entitled to enjoy Christmas with being participants in, or even witnesses to, the step-family drama, and there is apparently no way of avoiding it if you are with your family.\n\nMaybe you can visit your family members, except perhaps your brother, in small groups, if they are willing to agree to disagree.\n\nI sympathize - I broke with someone because I simply couldn't bear to watch how they treated some other people, but also didn't think that I could meaningfully intervene.", "NTA.   And congratulations", "> I remember it coming up that they wanted to change the kids names and all\n\nLike rehomed dogs? Wtf, NTA.", "Oh, they can be very open to suggestion, that's how all the batshit gets in. I agree with you though, just being pedantic."]}
