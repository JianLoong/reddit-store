The biggest AH here is your brother\u2019s wife. She should be protecting them. Are the kids getting grief counseling? I think your brother\u2019s family and your parents could all use family therapy. The least you might be able to do is mention it and that they might want to do some research instead of just creating their own reality.

Those kids, who have gone through a trauma already, need therapy and support. This family needs a family Therapist ASAP. Certainly their dad needs to be acknowledged because all your family is doing right now is building resentment. It is lovely that your all family wants to see them in the same way than any biological kids, however there is a difference between having a male role model/father figure in your life, and completely erasing the memories of their I guess loving dad. You gave plenty of notice not to attend, so it's OK not to go but let's face it, this won't traumatised your 3 months old who let's face it is more interesting in eating and sleeping. He really does not care. It could also be good for those kids to know that they have someone in their corner. I would also ask your brother how he would feel if it was one of your parents dying and suddenly he was asked to completely forgot them and call someone else mum/dad.", "NTA this dynamic isn't healthy for those children. This is just poor parenting", "NTA but are you cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\nHave your parents and brother always been like this.  Your SIL's kids are in a very different situation to your child.  Essentially your whole family wanted to wipe the kids memories of their dad and replace them with your brother instead.  That's an arse move.

At each new stage of development, they grieve for that parent over again. Your family might think they're helping raise the kids well by enforcing respect for authority.

Everyone with right brain and some empathy would say that kids who are half orphans are the most fragile creatures. And their new family should walk on eggshels and walk very slow, because kid's mourning can be longer and deeper than we stupid adults can even imagine. It's kind of nice that your bro wants to adopt them and stuff, but he has zero patience obviously. And he obviously hates to be in someone else's shadow, deceased or not. Poor kids. I won't be surprised if they would start to run from home maybe only in try to reach out some paternal side of family, or just because they don't feel safe. And what about maternal grandparents of those kids? Are they still alive? What's their opinion?\n\nETA: Please don't leave those kids alone with all those mental sharks. Go attend for their sake, take them aside and explain them that they must not do what they doesn't feel to do (like call you uncle etc) and that they can go to you and your wife if everything happens. Tell them you're sorry for their loss and you're sorry for your family behavior, try to explain them that you understand them and you don't agree with your family too.  \n\n\nETA2: I didn't notice you mentioned their maternal GP so ignore my questions or exchange maternal for paternal, because it is what I would like to know.", "NTA.

They Don't care enough to recognize that these children are Their Own Individual Selves.  They want to force them to be part of their happy hallmark belief without ever putting in the work to Earn that result and are actively Bullying these children to try and make it happen.  In about 7 years the oldest will leave, probably dropping contact, possibly offering his siblings the option to get away from a bunch of emotionally abusive assholes who try and Force a relationship.  If you think I'm being too harsh in that statement lets replace only two words in what they're doing. \n\n \"They are demanding the kids call him dad.\"  \"They are demanding she call him husband\"  \"They are demanding he call her sister\"  \"They are demanding you call him boss\" If these demands showed up without having earned the relationship that warrants the title would you be saying \"oh that's just how they are\" or would the response be \"get the fuck away from that person they are clearly a problem/danger\"\n\nAlso for the record No, just physically taking care of children who are biologically related to your spouse doesn't remotely count as doing enough to \"earn\" that title.  Same as being someones friend doesn't automatically give you the title of spouse, same as just being adopted doesn't give you the title of sibling, same as just being bossy doesn't give you the title of boss.

He didn't push it though, and didn't get mad at her for it. Now she sees him as a third parent, because he allowed the relationship to naturally develop. She still calls him by his first name, but he gave her away at her wedding, along with her bio dad. My other sister also sees him as her dad, despite her bio dad being around for her whole life (he just sucked).

No wonder they say it's just them and their mom. \nQuestion where is the mother in all this why is she not standing up for her kids and inform the audits they need time to decide who is family to them. \nAs for OP you had a kid 3 months ago (congrats) but are not going to the family Christmas because you don't want to expose your son to them. He's still a baby and is biologically yours how can they be pushy about that. \nThis should be a talk to your brother about giving these kids space from being told who family is and that maybe a break from Christmas party for the step kids is needed as they don't enjoy it at all.", "Congrats on your child.\n\nNTA. I support you not going.\n\nAt some point next year, see if you can spend time with the children. Let them know that you and your wife support them.\n\nOr try to spend time with your brother's family and allow them to not call you aunt and uncle. Tell your brother that they have a dad and he may be gone, but that doesn't mean he never existed. \n\nOne day these kids will leave and never come back. Until having a safe adult who supports them will be something that gives them a respite. \n\nAgain,  NTA. Even if you never see them again NTA.", "This. NTA & congrats", "NTA.  Your family and the kids mother will be cut out if these kids lives as soon as they can.  This is abuse and your little family is better off NOT there."]}
