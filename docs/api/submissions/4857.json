They told the kids to call me uncle and my two sisters aunts. I remember it coming up that they wanted to change the kids names and all. That first Christmas they were married were spent with his wife's family, but they ended up estranged because her parents wanted them to let the kids decide if he was dad or not.

I feel sorry for those kids who have not only lost their dad but are also forced to accept a new man into their lives who they should call dad from now on.\n\nI understand how you want to protect your own child and yourself from that negativity.", "NTA. You gave them plenty of notice but they have persisted. They demanded reasons but when you gave them they decided they didn't like them. You have done well to establish this boundary as they would expect you to go every year if you went once with your child.\n\nAs for being pushy, it would only be a matter of time before it's your child who has to conform to their expectations. Family members can get to know each other without your parents being there.", "NTA and you are off to a stellar beginning as a parent \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a", "NTA. You are seeing all of this very clearly. It seems the children who lost their father aren\u2019t being allowed to grieve and will never accept your brother as \u201cdad\u201d if it\u2019s being pushed on them. The biggest AH here is your brother\u2019s wife. She should be protecting them. Are the kids getting grief counseling? I think your brother\u2019s family and your parents could all use family therapy. The least you might be able to do is mention it and that they might want to do some research instead of just creating their own reality. However, my experience with people who create their own reality is that they usually aren\u2019t open to suggestion.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJeez I feel awful for those kids.", "NTA. Those kids, who have gone through a trauma already, need therapy and support. This family needs a family Therapist ASAP. Certainly their dad needs to be acknowledged because all your family is doing right now is building resentment. It is lovely that your all family wants to see them in the same way than any biological kids, however there is a difference between having a male role model/father figure in your life, and completely erasing the memories of their I guess loving dad. You gave plenty of notice not to attend, so it's OK not to go but let's face it, this won't traumatised your 3 months old who let's face it is more interesting in eating and sleeping. He really does not care. It could also be good for those kids to know that they have someone in their corner. I would also ask your brother how he would feel if it was one of your parents dying and suddenly he was asked to completely forgot them and call someone else mum/dad.", "NTA this dynamic isn't healthy for those children. This is just poor parenting", "NTA but are you cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\nHave your parents and brother always been like this.  Your SIL's kids are in a very different situation to your child.  Essentially your whole family wanted to wipe the kids memories of their dad and replace them with your brother instead.  That's an arse move.  If I were the kids I would've screamed at your parents too.\n\nJust what you write suggests there's a controlling to your parents which your kid may be much better off having little to do with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At each new stage of development, they grieve for that parent over again. Your family might think they're helping raise the kids well by enforcing respect for authority. But by forcing relationships that haven't yet developed, they're forcing adult timelines onto children. They're encroaching on their space to grieve and they're inspiring resentment for the step-parent: the exact opposite of their own intended goal.", "NTA and this is a good argument that your new born not he exposed to such hostile environment where someone can hate him for no reason!", "NTA. I would tell them this: if I attend I will be constantly calling the family out for disrespecting their boundaries. I would ask sil to her her face why she's allowing her children to be bullied by adults. I would call brother a child for throwing a tantrum over bit bring called \" dad\".

That comes with time and respect. At this point those kids will go NC as soon as they're old enough. All the adults pushing this need therapy. If you manage to stay around stand your ground. These kids need someone that gets it.", "NTA, i'd suggest to your brother that those kids get into family therapy.  I had stepkids who's mom died when they were 7 and 9.  I never expected them to call me mom, even though i was the mother figure in the marriage.  Your brother and SIL are thinking of themselves and not the kids.  As soon as they are old enough, they'll go NC", "NTA but I wouldn't be sitting calmly to know how poor kids are mistreated with them not be allowed to miss their dad, being practically erased of all their dad's existence... Everyone with right brain and some empathy would say that kids who are half orphans are the most fragile creatures. And their new family should walk on eggshels and walk very slow, because kid's mourning can be longer and deeper than we stupid adults can even imagine. It's kind of nice that your bro wants to adopt them and stuff, but he has zero patience obviously. And he obviously hates to be in someone else's shadow, deceased or not. Poor kids. I won't be surprised if they would start to run from home maybe only in try to reach out some paternal side of family, or just because they don't feel safe. And what about maternal grandparents of those kids? Are they still alive? What's their opinion?\n\nETA: Please don't leave those kids alone with all those mental sharks. Go attend for their sake, take them aside and explain them that they must not do what they doesn't feel to do (like call you uncle etc) and that they can go to you and your wife if everything happens. Tell them you're sorry for their loss and you're sorry for your family behavior, try to explain them that you understand them and you don't agree with your family too.  \n\n\nETA2: I didn't notice you mentioned their maternal GP so ignore my questions or exchange maternal for paternal, because it is what I would like to know.", "NTA. What a mess. Stay away from that craziness", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nI understand not wanting to watch or unwillingly participate in that brainwashing sessions. Poor kids.", "You were rude. Sometimes you have to be.\n\nNTA. I'm glad those kids have you on their side.", "NTA. I hope you can get through to your family because they're doing nothing but hurting those kids. And you were judging your family-rightly so, but it doesn't sound like you're judging the kids. \n\nThis story is so sad. \n\nCongratulations on the birth of your son. You're on the right track as a dad.", "You're a great not-uncle.  Trying to force steps to treat each other like real family is a sure-fire way to make them never think of each other as real family.
