She enjoys educating people about her Japanese culture, despite the fact that she knows nothing about it. Sometimes she spreads wrong information about Japan.

I told her, \"Just because you're Japanese by blood, it doesn't mean you're actually Japanese. The only reason why you consider yourself \"Japanese\" is because of your obsession with Anime. Changing your last name to your Mom's maiden name is fucking stupid.\" She blew up on me and said \"You're so fucking white it's embarrassing\" and left.\n\nShe sent me a text yesterday saying \"So you're not going to apologize to me?\".

My friend called me \"white\" because she calls everyone who acts American \"white\". No, I'm not lying about my race. Sarah even calls her mom \"white\" because her mom acts too American. She always says as a joke, \"My mom is so white.\"   \n\n\nAlso, I wouldn't have a problem if my friend doesn't use her race as a source all the time. She's always like, \"I'm right because I'm Japanese\" on the internet. Even on her instagram bio she says she's 100% Japanese.

It doesn't matter if she is wrong, she is still Japanese.", "INFO: You realize she is Japanese (unless there is an adoption we don't know about). Why are you determining being 'Japanese' by factors (e.g., blood, culture, citizenship)? I think she is simply getting on your nerves and instead of convey this this you blew up.", "YTA. She is Japanese, and she is actively working on knowing the culture. So what if she is wrong once in a while ? No one is always 100% right about their own culture.", "YTA. Her nationality may be American, but she\u2019s ethnically Japanese.

In the literal first sentence you said you became friends with her because of her Japanese heritage.", "YTA.  My question though is why does it bother you so much as to what she does?  What she does may annoy you, but you give no indication in your post that it\u2019s causing anything more than just an annoyance to you.\n\nYes, she may be \u201conly\u201d half Japanese, but you do not have to be 100% of a nationality to be considered that nationality.  While being Japanese is half of her heritage, it\u2019s still her heritage and one that she seems to be proud of.  Her wanting to change her last name to reflect that has absolutely no effect on you therefore in this situation, you should have kept your opinions to yourself.", "YTA. Japanese American woman here. It\u2019s hard enough to be Asian American in the USA sometimes, we really don\u2019t need to be making it harder on our fellow Asian Americans. Most Japanese Americans didn\u2019t grow up closely tied to Japanese culture. I think it\u2019s due to the racism and internment camps during and after WWII and there was more pressure on Japanese Americans to act \u201cwhite\u201d to prove they were Americans. It was a completely terrible situation but I can\u2019t blame those generations for acting how they did, they were trying to make things better for the children and grandchildren in this country. My parents don\u2019t speak any Japanese and neither did my grandparents. I never went to Japan until I traveled there for work in my 30s.  But I\u2019ve noticed that my generation (my cousins) and their kids have grown closer to Japanese culture (my cousin\u2019s kids have Japanese first names, which no one has has for a few generations) which I think is great. Everyone has their own journey to discover themselves and their heritage, and it sounds like your friend is doing that. Who cares if she initially connected to Japan through anime? Give her space to explore her identity and stop gatekeeping. Personally I say that I\u2019m American, and if asked my heritage I say I\u2019m Japanese.

Holy fuck. Someone being uneducated about their culture is not the same as not being Japanese.  So she's not connected to Japanese culture...Did it ever cross your mind that she's changing her name because she's aware of her disconnect, feels alienated due to her lack of roots, and wants to get more in touch with that side? Or does she need to get a permission slip from you, oh True Arbiter of Japanese Diasporans, to do that? \n\nHonestly you should know this already: but being mixed in a predominantly white society is hard and weird. You're an other because of your Japanese heritage and you're an other among Japanese people. It was genuinely awful for you to assume that her name change is about her liking anime and it makes me wonder if you like or respect her at all. \n\nYes, she should stop saying unfounded things about Japan. No, this does not give you the right to deny she's Japanese and belittle her for trying to get in touch with her roots. I'm biracial (wasian)and also identify more with my Japanese side because of the racism I and my family have experienced from white people. It is a perfectly valid and common way for mixed people to see their racial identities.\n\nApologize to your friend and stop projecting your weird internalized racism into her.", "YTA. Look you had a good reason to educate your friend, but you completely messed up. Your friend is Japanese. You cant argue her ethnicity. What you should have done and focus your attention on was correcting her about her information about Japan. Its completely fine that she got interested in japan due to anime but she could have at least spread the correct information instead of the wrong kind because since she is Japanese, people will believe her even though she's never been to Japan. I got interested in japan through anime but it soon became a genuine interest because the culture is so fascinating and I'm learning different things all the time.

You say in comments you\u2019re half Mexican and half Japanese and that you look more Mexican. You also say you became friends with this person because you both related to your Japanese heritage. I\u2019m feeling like this is insecurity on your part, because your friend might look more Japanese, and her attempts to connect more with that part of your shared heritage by changing her name are gonna take her further from how you relate to her as being biracial. That\u2019s not something you can gate keep. She has every right to pursue whatever avenues she wants in order to connect with her heritage. Nothing is stopping you from doing the same.

It's a way of feeling like you're connecting or belong to something in a country that continually others you. \n\nThe ongoing battle between Asian Americans and Asians in Asia is well known, of them also giving folks in the US that same sense of alienation. You don't need to add to your friend's sense of not belonging. Your dad is also not the authority on how someone gets to identify themselves.

We are constantly being told we aren\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d of something to be a part of a particular community. You said you bonded being biracial.

If that\u2019s the case then wtf is she?\n\nAlso saw your comment about her not speaking Japanese - it was incredibly common for Japanese Americans to not teach their kids (especially baby boomers) the Japanese language due to trying to their parents trying to assimilate after all the prejudice they faced during WWII in the US.

My parents are from India and I will never presume to call myself an Indian. It is completely different being raised as American and being raised as Indian. Ethnically, we may be one thing; but nationally, we can be another. There\u2019s a reason that nationality and ethnicity are separate. Your friend sounds like she doesn\u2019t even know the first thing about living in Japan, let alone true Japanese culture. My guess is that she is the typical anime or K-pop fan that thinks she knows everything about Japan based on that and nothing else. And I feel your pain, because they\u2019re so annoying.

It's not her fault her upbringing didn't include a better understanding *of* that heritage but it's not your place to deny her an identity she comes by genuinely and her wanting to develop that connection more isn't a bad thing regardless of the impetus.

One of the big identity issues with being biracial (or also bi-cultural ie: Asian American) is that many people from both side see you as not one or the other so they don't recognize you as  such.
