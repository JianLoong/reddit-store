It doesn't matter if she is wrong, she is still Japanese.", "INFO: You realize she is Japanese (unless there is an adoption we don't know about). Why are you determining being 'Japanese' by factors (e.g., blood, culture, citizenship)? I think she is simply getting on your nerves and instead of convey this this you blew up.", "YTA.

What she does may annoy you, but you give no indication in your post that it\u2019s causing anything more than just an annoyance to you.\n\nYes, she may be \u201conly\u201d half Japanese, but you do not have to be 100% of a nationality to be considered that nationality.  While being Japanese is half of her heritage, it\u2019s still her heritage and one that she seems to be proud of.  Her wanting to change her last name to reflect that has absolutely no effect on you therefore in this situation, you should have kept your opinions to yourself.", "YTA. Japanese American woman here. It\u2019s hard enough to be Asian American in the USA sometimes, we really don\u2019t need to be making it harder on our fellow Asian Americans. Most Japanese Americans didn\u2019t grow up closely tied to Japanese culture. I think it\u2019s due to the racism and internment camps during and after WWII and there was more pressure on Japanese Americans to act \u201cwhite\u201d to prove they were Americans. It was a completely terrible situation but I can\u2019t blame those generations for acting how they did, they were trying to make things better for the children and grandchildren in this country. My parents don\u2019t speak any Japanese and neither did my grandparents. I never went to Japan until I traveled there for work in my 30s.  But I\u2019ve noticed that my generation (my cousins) and their kids have grown closer to Japanese culture (my cousin\u2019s kids have Japanese first names, which no one has has for a few generations) which I think is great. Everyone has their own journey to discover themselves and their heritage, and it sounds like your friend is doing that. Who cares if she initially connected to Japan through anime? Give her space to explore her identity and stop gatekeeping. Personally I say that I\u2019m American, and if asked my heritage I say I\u2019m Japanese.

Holy fuck. Someone being uneducated about their culture is not the same as not being Japanese.  So she's not connected to Japanese culture...Did it ever cross your mind that she's changing her name because she's aware of her disconnect, feels alienated due to her lack of roots, and wants to get more in touch with that side? Or does she need to get a permission slip from you, oh True Arbiter of Japanese Diasporans, to do that? \n\nHonestly you should know this already: but being mixed in a predominantly white society is hard and weird. You're an other because of your Japanese heritage and you're an other among Japanese people. It was genuinely awful for you to assume that her name change is about her liking anime and it makes me wonder if you like or respect her at all. \n\nYes, she should stop saying unfounded things about Japan. No, this does not give you the right to deny she's Japanese and belittle her for trying to get in touch with her roots. I'm biracial (wasian)and also identify more with my Japanese side because of the racism I and my family have experienced from white people. It is a perfectly valid and common way for mixed people to see their racial identities.\n\nApologize to your friend and stop projecting your weird internalized racism into her.", "YTA. Look you had a good reason to educate your friend, but you completely messed up. Your friend is Japanese. You cant argue her ethnicity. What you should have done and focus your attention on was correcting her about her information about Japan. Its completely fine that she got interested in japan due to anime but she could have at least spread the correct information instead of the wrong kind because since she is Japanese, people will believe her even though she's never been to Japan. I got interested in japan through anime but it soon became a genuine interest because the culture is so fascinating and I'm learning different things all the time.

I\u2019m feeling like this is insecurity on your part, because your friend might look more Japanese, and her attempts to connect more with that part of your shared heritage by changing her name are gonna take her further from how you relate to her as being biracial. That\u2019s not something you can gate keep. She has every right to pursue whatever avenues she wants in order to connect with her heritage. Nothing is stopping you from doing the same.

Your friend sounds like she doesn\u2019t even know the first thing about living in Japan, let alone true Japanese culture. My guess is that she is the typical anime or K-pop fan that thinks she knows everything about Japan based on that and nothing else. And I feel your pain, because they\u2019re so annoying.

One of the big identity issues with being biracial (or also bi-cultural ie: Asian American) is that many people from both side see you as not one or the other so they don't recognize you as  such.

The third gens here would absolutely be classified as American if they ever went back to their native countries, and it\u2019s honestly a bit grating when they act like absolutely authorities on a culture they don\u2019t fully understand and a country they\u2019ve never even been to. \n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s disingenuous to divorce any minority from their cultural identities given the struggles they\u2019ve faced being seen as \u201cdifferent\u201d in the U.S. Regardless of whether or not the girl truly understands Japanese culture, she is Japanese-American. The hyphen is there for a reason. Her Japanese identity, regardless of how small, exists. It doesn\u2019t hurt anyone for her to want to learn more and connect with her culture, or change her name. OPs comments were completely unnecessary. She is not the absolute authority on what makes someone Japanese, nor is she the surname police. She is not even full Japanese herself. Had she expressed her opinions politely and respectfully, I would have said n-t-a. Sadly, her immature response here makes her an AH.

In world war 2, when they were pre teens, the government decreed them, their entire family, and community, a threat to national security due to their race, seized all their families property, businesses, and money. Then transported them to the middle of nowhere and forced them all to live in an internment camp, in tin shacks, surrounded by barb wire. This includes children and the elderly. Despite being naturalized citizens of Canada, being ethnically Japanese was enough for the government to decide to steal their livelihood and lock them up like animals.\n\nSince you're clearly baffled by the idea of people being proud of their ethnicity/culture when not having as much connection to it, here's your answer to why that exists: we were Japanese enough when they decided put us in a camp.\n\nEdit: why'd you dirty delete the bulk of your comment? \ud83e\uddd0", "\n\n>There's a wide difference between growing up in the culture and having it in a distant bloodline.\n\nSo fucking weird and wrong for a non Japanese person to call being half a \"distant bloodline\".", ">This is gonna blow your mind too: an ethnically non-Japanese person that was born in Japan but raised in a non-Japanese household is ALSO Japanese.

Nationality, ethnicity, race, and culture. You can be a mixed bag of all different things. \n\nBeing Japanese or Mexican can be different things to different people. \n\nMy parents were born and raised in Z country, but they have lived in the US longer than their home country at this point.

You also express frustration at the obvious racism in Americans and the effect it has had on your cousins and I suspect you too.  Finally, you\u2019ve mentioned what your father has always told you quite a bit in your comments which leads me to think that his statements about who you are have left a deeper effect on you than you realize.\n\nIs it possible that your frustration with your friend\u2019s desire to be more in touch with her Japanese heritage is not because of her actions but because of your experiences?  And even so, you still haven\u2019t answered the question as to why her choosing to change her last name has anything to do with you.", "An American by virtue of parental citizenship born and raised in Japan isn't likely to ever be considered \"Japanese\", either.", "This is actually a really big difference across cultures. You're right that Americans especially tend to place a lot of emphasis on what someone's ethnic or racial heritage is, when it comes to classifying identity. It has a lot to do with our history as an immigrant country. \n\nIt's actually the opposite in Japan tho (I say this as someone who lived there for over a decade). There's a large population of Koreans, for example, who are born and raised in Japan going back two and even three generations sometimes... and yet many people don't consider them \"real\" Japanese, they will always be seen as Koreans. Even if they've never been there and don't even speak the language. \n\nAnyway, I totally get why you're annoyed by your friend, and that some or what she does/says seems cringe to you. But it's not your place to decide how she's allowed to experience her own identity. It sounds like you struggle with being seen as Japanese over American -- which is absolutely frustrating-- and that's affecting your reaction to your friend, and making you take it really personally. \n\nMaybe you see her as someone who has thr privilege of being seen as \"American\" by others, without the constant *but where are you reeeeeeaaallly from??* And it feels to you like she's making light of that. \n\nYTA", "\u201cEthnicity\u201d is not DNA.
