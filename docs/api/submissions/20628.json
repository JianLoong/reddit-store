Jane lost her fiance 5 years ago, when she was pregnant, which was devastating news for our entire family and I know it was really tough on her.\n\nI'm a huge Taylor Swift fan and at the time her Reputation concerts were going on. Me and my friends bought tickets a long time ago and took a road trip to go. The dates clashed with Jane's fiance's funeral so I didn't go. I realize now that wasn't right but I was younger then and the concert was more important. This impacted mine and Jane's relationship and at the time I also thought she was overreacting, and we didn't talk at all for months. After a while we got back in contact and I've apologized to her many times over the years, but our relationship isn't really like before.\n\nI got married in 2021 and gave birth to our first baby in April. I asked Jane to be my MOH but she refused, came to the ceremony but left early. When I asked her later why, she said because she had more important things to do. I was really hurt but didn't argue with her.\n\nMy daughter is a couple of months old now, Jane sent a gift basket but still hasn't come to see her. All of me and my husband's families have. A few days ago I called and asked casually when she planning to come visit us. What does Jane say? Only her famous line, that she'll come when she finds time and she has more important things to do.\n\nI sort of blew up and said I apologized to her, she's dragging this on for one thing I did years ago and if she could let me know when she'd stop hold grudges. Jane got pretty pissed at me and said what she does isn't any of my business.\n\nEdit: I've apologized to her a lot. I accepted what I did was wrong and I wouldn't do something like this again. Jane never gives me a straight answer on where we are", "created_utc": 1687779240, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jeum2/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_sister_after_she/", "score": 365, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can\u2019t just apologize and consider everything ok.  Now you\u2019re surprised that your sister doesn\u2019t care at all about you?", "YTA. You showed your sister where she rated in your life on one of her most horrible days. You may have apologized but that does not mean you get the relationship you want back.\n\nShe honestly will never get over this. She will always hold you at arms length. She is taking your lead and does not prioritize you like you didn\u2019t prioritize her. \n\nYou can\u2019t be mad when YOU set the dynamics of your relationship. Your sister is entitled to prioritize people who where there for her when she needed them. And simply wasn\u2019t you. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to do a very shitty thing to someone you claim to love then get a pass because\nYou apologize and say it was because your where young and dumb! Fact is actions have consequences and your sisters reaction to major life events is the consequences of your own actions.\n\n\nIf you can\u2019t support your sister at her lowest darkest times then don\u2019t expect her to drop everything for you. \n\nYour child isn\u2019t the center of everyone\u2019s world. They don\u2019t have to prioritize her even if you didn\u2019t do a shitty thing to your sister. She still doesn\u2019t have to drop everything to gush over your child.\n\n\nEdit: I seen your edit that you apologize and your sister won\u2019t tell you where you stand. \n\nBless your heart she is telling you! But you haven\u2019t changed. Your still the self center selfish person who choose a road-trip and a concert over supporting your sister during a horrible time.\n\nSo stop playing the Victim and making your sister out to be the bad person in this! You did this! Not her!", "YTA, you fucked up royally and she doesn't have to forgive you. Apologizing doesn't magically make it better. You are acting entitled.", "YTA - You will always be the asshole. Your sister lost the love of her life and you couldn\u2019t be bothered. She doesn\u2019t have to ever be close to you again. She will most likely always have her guard up with you for showing who you were at her worst life moment. That\u2019s on you, Boo Boo.", "YTA.\n\nFirst- close relationship and you still prioritised a concert over your sister's fianc\u00e9's funeral. Holy shit.\n\nSecond- Just because you apologised doesn't mean you're entitled to be forgiven.What you did was shitty (as shitty as can be). \n\nYour relationship with your sister is in ruins because of YOU. Live with it.\n\nEdit: just got to know from her comments, OP was about 29 years old when she did this ????? This is ridiculous. You're a bad sister and should be grateful for whatever semblance of a relationship you have. I'd cut contact w you tbvh.\n\nEdit 2: not only were you 29, but you're also 2 years OLDER to Jane? Holy hell. This is just ?????????", "YTA\n\nYou destroyed your relationship with your sister.  It's gone.  No amount of crying or begging will get it back.  This is not about a grudge.

She's written you out of hers.", "YTA\n\nOut of curiosity, what have your apologies been like?\n\nA good apology\n\n* admits exactly what you are apologizing for\n* undoes what damage is possible to do. (in your case there is nothing you can do.)\n* explains exactly what you have done to make sure that you don't repeat what you did\n* finally shows true remorse and says you are sorry.\n\nI think it is time for you to understand exactly how deeply your selfishness and immaturity affected your sister. She is allowed to never forgive you.", "YTA for skipping her fiance\u2019s funeral for a Taylor Swift concert. You acknowledge this caused a rift. Yes, you did apologise but she\u2019s not obligated to accept it. You\u2019re the one that fucked up here and have no right blowing up at her for not wanting to forgive you and move on.", "Go ask Taylor to come see your baby since you like her so much..", "YTA. You made your bed.", "YTA. She lost her fianc\u00e9 when she was pregnant with their child, and you, the person who by admission said was a close family member, ditched her at possibly the worst moment of her life to see Taylor Swift. You put her, her baby, and your family below a pop star who will never know you at such a terrible time. You destroyed that relationship, cut that tie, quite frankly I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll never get it back no matter how much you apologize. \n\nAnd now you expect her to put that behind her, a MEASLY FIVE YEARS LATER (I can\u2019t believe you think she\u2019d be over this by now. You just barely finish an undergrad degree in that time) and put you and your baby and your husband for an EVENT SHE NEVER GOT TO HAVE WITH HER FAMILY?? And for somebody who trashed her during her familial crisis? \n\nThat\u2019s so twisted and cruel. \n\nI hope you see these comments and genuinely repent, and realize that not only did she show grace by even sending anything and showing up to your wedding, but you blowing up on her was a top tier asshole move. YAH all the way. I\u2019m so sorry to this poor woman.", "You skipped her fiance's funeral for a concert then are upset she hasn't seen a baby in 2 months but sent a gift? Yeah this isn't real.\n\nETA: judgment YTA but I don't want to believe someone could do something so horrible to someone then turn arand get mad that person isn't lining up for something so unimportant as seeing a baby. It's not like the baby has any idea what's going on that it has to meet people within an immediate window.", "Yta. You showed her that Tay-Tay was waaay more important than being there for her when she needed you most. She can accept your apology but doesn't erase what you have done before.\n\nDid you even check how she was? Or see how she is", "For sure YTA. For all the reasons already mentioned. But have you stopped basking in your own desires to consider that maybe she doesn't want to visit your baby because of the emotional impact it may have on her. She lost her fianc\u00e9 while pregnant! An empathetic person can foresee it may be difficult to visit your baby, with two parents present. Her child will never have a father and that is something she has to emotionally address every single day. Maybe she's not ready to visit because your family situation stimulates her grief.", "YTA\n\nI think you know exactly where you stand with her. She's sending gifts and making appearances at your important events because that's probably easier than cutting you off completely. If she wants a relationship or to visit your baby, she'll let you know but don't hold your breath.\n\nHow did her pregnancy go? Did she have any issues? Being pregnant and planning your husbands funeral can't be a good combo.", "YTA. Just because you apologized doesn't make everything better. Leave her alone and let her come to you when/if she's ever ready.", "YTA\n\nEveryone else has explained why regarding the funeral, I'm looking at the recent stuff. \n\nYou are still making everything about you, do you realise this? You asked her when she was coming to visit you. Did you consider asking if she would like to come and visit the baby? \n\nEvery time something self centred comes out of your mouth, she is going to remember the one, really big huge heartbreaking time you chose yourself and your interests over her, when she was at an extremely low time. \n\nStop making this about you, and start making it about her.", "INFO: Did she know you were trouble when you walked in?", "INFO: what do you mean \u201cI also thought she was overreacting?\u201d How did you express this? It wasn\u2019t **just** missing the funeral was it?\n\nEdit: YTA based on your reply. I think it\u2019s time to let it go. Take whatever relationship she is offering, respect her boundaries, forgive yourself, and move on. You will not have the type of relationship you want with her and that\u2019s just what it is.", "YTA.  It think it\u2019s pretty obvious where Jane is in terms of this relationship.  You are a sister with whom she has a cordial relationship, but you are no longer close.  You don\u2019t seem to get how deeply you hurt her and why she does not trust you anymore.  If you didn\u2019t talk for months, were you around when she had her baby?  How much of an effort did you make to help her out when she had a newborn and was still grieving the loss of her fianc\u00e9?", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m gonna try to put this nicely even when I think that was you did at the time was extremely cruel.\n\nLook, you can recognise that what you did is wrong, you can mature and change your ways and actually become a better person. You can apologise 1000 times over and over again until your voice fails you, but you\u2019re forgetting an important aspect of a sincere apology: the hurt/affected person *doesn\u2019t owe you forgiveness*. Your sister could hate you for the rest of her life (and it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s that bad, since she still sends gifts and made an appearance at your wedding), *and you have to deal with it*.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it will obviously suck for you, even if and maybe *because* you think that you\u2019ve changed so you want to show her that change. You might have actually become a better person, but your sister just doesn\u2019t owe you her forgiveness and part of apologising is to accept that. Give her time and gracefully try to earn her trust and forgiveness, because it takes one moment to ruin an entire relationship and part of becoming a better person is learning to accept that it might take a lifetime for things to get better.", "YTA. You reap what you sow", "YTA, even now you say that the concert was more important than being there for your grieving sister. She lost the love of her life, the one she was going to marry. But you brush it off as if you accidentally killed her plant or something.\n\nI assume her \"famous line\" is also something similar to what you told her when she needed you the most and you failed to be there for her. I hope the concert was worth the relationship with your sister! She doesn't owe you anything.\n\nI assume the only reason she doesn't cut contact with you completely is because of your parents tbh.", "YTA - You made a decision that impacted your relationship with your sister. She is not punishing you or holding your actions against you. She simply stopped seeing her relationship with you as a priority. You are not entitled to a relationship with your sister. Your actions have consequences.", "YTA for acting so entitled after treating your sister like garbage. Your apologies don't come across as honestly remorseful of your actions, and therefore your apologies don't justify forgiveness on your sister's part.\n\nThis post just screams ME ME ME ME ME ME.", "YTA. Even without the other stuff, no one has a duty to come see your baby. It's your sister's right to not be interested in your kid.", "YTA. You can never undo what you did to her. You may as well move on bc you lost your sister.", "YTA\n\n  \nI understand you apologized. You may well truly be sorry, but the fact here is that the stunt you pulled is so cruel, your sister will probably never forgive you. Or maybe she has forgiven you but is keeping you at a distance, I don't know, but she's well within her rights to do whatever she wants in terms of a relationship with you.\n\n  \nNothing wrong with being big fans of celebrities and enjoying their work, but when these people who have no idea you exist and frankly don't give two shits about you start mattering more than the people actually in your life, there's a problem.\n\n  \nTaylor didn't care you were at her concert. You decided supporting an extremely rich woman (who doesn't know you) by giving her more money so she could sing some songs about her exes, was more important than supporting your pregnant sister who had to bury her partner.", "wow, blow for the past, i remenber the original post, everyone told you this would happen, you choose getting early to a concert that going to you bil funeral, and you were rather close to him if i remenber all right, you played stupid games and won the price, i would never see you again if i were her, i wonder though if you have the chance to go to more concerts, or maybe another bil funeral?\n\nlive with the consecuences yta", "Yes, YTA. What you did to her is unforgivable. If I were in her shoes, I doubt I\u2019d answer your phone calls or send any gifts. You\u2019d be dead to me. The best part about close relationships, family or friend, is knowing that person has your back 100%. There\u2019s love and comfort in knowing that. You cannot provide her with that feeling of trust anymore.", "YTA. Did she lose her pregnancy as well or is she now a single mom? Because either way you\u2019re a complete asshole. \n\nAnd I say that as a MASSIVE Taylor swift fan - wtf is wrong with you?!", "YTA and apologies do not guarantee forgiveness. Did it occur to you that the things you are pressuring her to participate in (weddings, pregnancy, babies) could be extremely traumatizing to her due to the circumstances of her loss?", "YTA\nYes you\u2019ve apologized but now you need to wait for her to come around. She has recognized your daughter\u2019s birth so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s completely ignoring you.\n\nClearly she\u2019s still hurt and while it will fade over time you can\u2019t force her to feel close to you till she is ready", "Info: you say Jane was pregnant when she lost her fiance.\n\nDid she have the baby?\n\nIf she did or did not (for any reason), were you there for her then? If she had the baby, when did you visit? If she didn't, when did you visit?", "YTA, clearly and without doubt. She doesn\u2019t have to forgive you for missing her fianc\u00e9\u2019s funeral for a damn concert. She\u2019s being civil with you, but it\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t want a sisterly relationship with you. You can\u2019t take back what you did, but she isn\u2019t obligated to accept your apologies. You\u2019re now living with the consequences of your selfish actions. That \u201cone thing you did years ago\u201d is something I would never, *ever* forgive you for either.", "YTA\n\nYou permanently damaged the relationship, it will never be the same.  Your sister is being civil, she hasn't completely cut you out and she's set boundaries for how much she'll interact with you.  You need to accept that this is your relationship now.", "I just want to know how involved you are with this niece/nephew. I mean if you\u2019re never asking to have kiddo for a weekend or putting thought into gifts for birthdays & gifts\u2026\n\nI can see why she\u2019s a total Elsa. \n\nBut all of this-from a Swift fan to another-YTA.", "INFO: When you say you've apologised many times over the years, how sincere has it been? How have you tried to make it up to her?\n\nAlso I think your sister sending a gift was her trying to mend the relationship, and you've blown up at her after her trying to fix things.", "YTA\n\n>I've apologized to her a lot. I accepted what I did was wrong and I wouldn't do something like this again.\n\nThat does not matter. You could give Jane the most genuine heartfelt apology every day from now until the end of time. That does not change the fact that you hurt her very deeply and she will never look at you the same way again. And it can take more than an apology to heal the level of pain you caused your sister. Give her space. Either she'll come around or she won't, but pushing her to get over her \"grudge\" just to see your baby is only going to make things worse between you.", "Swifty YTA and Taylor would agree", "YTA. I hope it was the concert of a lifetime for you, because it cost you your relationship with your sister. The damage you did may very well be irreparable. You're lucky she's keeping things civil, which she may be doing for the rest of the family's sake rather than yours. Given how she feels about you  she probably decided it's best for her not to develop a close relationship with your daughter, which is fair. Don't expect her to be a present aunt. It doesn't matter how many times you've apologized, you can't undo what you did. I can't blame her for telling you she has more important things to do when you yourself straight up said the concert was more important to you than being there for her at the funeral. You made your choice. You cannot make it up to her. What's done is done.", "Yta, I dont know what else to say that everyone hasn't said, you betrayed her trust and she hasnt, probably will not forgive you. Sure you were young and dumb, But sometimes there are things that are unforgivable. Blowing up at your sis is likely confirming that your more interested in yourself and instead makes the situation worse. Apologies mean nothing as your actions speak much louder.", "Yta, and I hope everytime it's you or your kids birthday or any other celebration for y'all that your sister has a concert or something more important to attend to instead", "MASSIVE YTA. \n\nUnless you were 9 when you went to the concert, there\u2019s no age where you think \u201cyeah missing the funeral of the love of my sister\u2019s life and her child\u2019s father is less important than seeing t-swizzle\u201d makes sense. \n\nSecond of all, who are you to dictate that she doesn\u2019t actually have more important things to do. May be she is just firing your stupid reason at you over and over again. Or maybe she\u2019s justly decided, you\u2019re not her priority, so she really does have more important things to do. \n\nShe came back into contact with you, but maybe she has complicated feelings about that too. Maybe she thinks it\u2019s the right thing to do cause your sisters. Maybe she doesn\u2019t actually want to be involved in your life and she just participates because \u201cblood is thicker than water\u201d (I know the real saying). \n\nYou said yourself, the relationship isn\u2019t the same. That\u2019s really unfortunate, but it is what it is. \n\nShe went to your wedding and she sent you a baby basket. Just accept that. \n\nAlso that was a really tactless thing to say \u201chey tell me when you stop holding grudges\u201d you could have phrased it differently and been gentle, but firm. \n\n\u201cIt seems you and I still have things that need to be worked out. If you need your space from me, please take that time. I hurt you badly, and if there are still wounds that need to be healed, please take your time. I will be here if you are ever ready. And if you are not, I understand and accept that.\u201d \n\nYou may have apologized, but she does not have to accept it. And even if she accepted it, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not still hurting.", "YTA. Apologizing will never erase the fact that you showed your sister how little your relationship with her meant at the time. Honestly, I never understood people who chose concerts over family.", "YTA. From the way you\u2019re describing it, you do not come off like a pleasant person to be around and it sounds like you believe that you are entitled to a lot. You\u2019re entitled to her forgiveness, her time and effort, her love and affection etc. It does not sound like you give her anything, you only expect to receive. It has only been 5 years since she lost her partner and her child\u2019s father, and you chose a concert over emotionally supporting her. \n\nYou do not get to decide if and when she forgives you,  and you do not get to decide what kind of relationship she wants to have with you going forward. Get over yourself.", "Oh YTA alright. You say \"I was younger then\" as some poor excuse for abandoning your sister at the worst point in her life to go a concert but you were 29. 29!! That's quite quite old enough to know that what you were doing was bang out of order.\n\nYour sister seems to have been quite gracious and civil about this over the years and that's frankly more than you'd get from me in her position.\n\nI'm afraid you broke this relationship with your sister, and I'm not sure if it can be repaired. I completely understand that you've apologised but apologising doesn't un-do the hurt you caused, and she has no obligation to accept. You even call this \"holding a grudge\" like it's some petty, small thing. I'm not sure you understand how much you've hurt her.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA  \n\n\nNot because of the past (which was clearly bad, but not the topic at hand) but because you are still thinking about how this impacts on you, and not thinking about how difficult it would be for your sister to see you and your husband getting to experience what she lost out on.  \n\n\nLet her decide when she is ready.", "She is not holding a grudge, she is holding you accountable for your shit behavior. The audacity of you to blow up at her is really something else. YTA all day.", "YTA, but if you were 14 at the time I might think differently. In either case, this isn't something you can fix, I'm sorry to say. Most of us past a certain age have someone we no longer are close to after they crapped out on a funeral. \n\nApologizing is good, but realize an apology doesn't erase what happened. You don't have any right for her to resume her relationship with you, and after you blew up at her there's probably zero chance she ever will.", "INFO: how old are you n your sis? Did she go through her pregnancy or did the stress cause any issues? How close do you two live? Is she with someone else now or potentially raising a kid by her own?", "YTA", "You were AH once and sometimes that\u2019s all it takes if the person needed you. Your decision broke that bond and she has no obligation to forgive you for it despite your apologies. I\u2019m sure it sucks, but you get what you pay for and sometimes end up with buyers remorse.", "YTA. Part of apologizing is accepting that someone may not accept your apology or they may only accept it on certain terms. An apology is for the person you\u2019ve hurt, not you. It sounds like your sister has decided to have a surface level relationship with you (talking), but not a deep sisterly one and you pushing for more while only coming back with \u201cI apologized!\u201d is a problem. You\u2019re making the apology about you. \n\nIf you want a deeper relationship you should probably ask her what she wants or just accept she doesn\u2019t want that. Have you just apologized or have you really dug into what you did and how exactly your hurt your sister? Are you just paying lip service to an apology? You let her down at a time when she was incredibly vulnerable and you can regret it a lot, but that doesn\u2019t change it. Accept your actions have consequences even if you were younger and want to move on.", "Unfortunately YTA. I\u2019m interested to know how old you where when this concert/funeral happened? 15? 20? That makes a difference. What about your family. No one told you that was absolutely out of line and you would do long term damage? \n\nIt seems like you damaged your relationship beyond repair. She\u2019s being civil by coming to your wedding and maintaining contact but she does not want to be your MOH or or sit with your new baby. Remember she was in the deepest darkest pit of her life when she had her baby and you abandoned her. That\u2019s a hurt that will likely never go away. You need to accept the role you played and stop pushing her to have a deeper relationship.", "Some things can't be forgiven with just a \"sorry\".  It is up to her when/if she ever fully forgives you but you need to realize it isn't up to you when that is.  Really this is rather unbelievable cause to just skip out on your sister in what was the worst time in her life by a large margin is just beyond selfish.  I think you are lucky she even talks to you at all I certainly wouldn't.  YTA", "YTA. Apologizing sometimes is not enough. You can't fix things in this category with an apology and then expect trying to go back to normal because you apologized.\n\nGreetings from someone whose sister threw a tantrum when I cancelled on a concert because my boyfriend had an accident that left him with permanent brain damage. She apologized too, but not before it became inconvenient for her that I went LC. I accepted her apology as half heartedly as she delivered it.\n\nI understand you would do better now, which is good, but you are not entitled to anything regarding your sister.", "Honestly it sounds like your relationship will never be any kind of close again - more like distant cousins a few times removed that are nice to each other but you wouldn\u2019t call them in an emergency or to share important news.\n\nLook, I get that you were younger and chose to go to a concert blah blah blah, but you did so on ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING DAYS of your sisters life. There is no coming back from that. One of the few days she really really needed you, you prioritised your friends and a concert - there is NO coming back from that. She knows she cannot trust you to be there so why should she be there for you, you abandoned her when she most needed you. \n\nYou can apologise a million times, it does not turn back time and put your arse in a seat in the church/crematorium/wherever it was held.

Jane lost her fiance 5 years ago, when she was pregnant, which was devastating news for our entire family and I know it was really tough on her.\n\n  \nI'm a huge Taylor Swift fan and at the time her Reputation concerts were going on. Me and my friends bought tickets a long time ago and took a road trip to go. The dates clashed with Jane's fiance's funeral so I didn't go. I realize now that wasn't right but I was younger then and the concert was more important. This impacted mine and Jane's relationship and at the time I also thought she was overreacting, and we didn't talk at all for months. After a while we got back in contact and I've apologized to her many times over the years, but our relationship isn't really like before.\n\nI got married in 2021 and gave birth to our first baby in April. I asked Jane to be my MOH but she refused, came to the ceremony but left early. When I asked her later why, she said because she had more important things to do. I was really hurt but didn't argue with her.\n\nMy daughter is a couple of months old now, Jane sent a gift basket but still hasn't come to see her. All of me and my husband's families have. A few days ago I called and asked casually when she planning to come visit us. What does Jane say? Only her famous line, that she'll come when she finds time and she has more important things to do. \n\nI sort of blew up and said I apologized to her, she's dragging this on for one thing I did years ago and if she could let me know when she'd stop hold grudges. Jane got pretty pissed at me and said she'll do whatever she wants.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You made a life-altering decision AS A 29 YEAR OLD ADULT (not a child who could use the excuse of being young and stupid) and now your life is altered. Your relationship with your sister will never go back to what it was before you skipped the funeral, when you could have justifiably gotten angry at her for not visiting your baby. You defined your relationship with that decision years ago and you'll continue to be TA if you don't face that.", "YTA. My sister and I had a close relationship for decades, I came out as gay and she was very supportive\u2026 One Thanksgiving my fianc\u00e9 and I took a flight to see them (they had moved across country), we booked a hotel and when I let her know we had arrived at the hotel she told me she would \u201clet me know, because a friend from HS was visiting with their kids and they weren\u2019t comfortable with gays around their kids\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor. I started crying in the lobby of the hotel that the person I would chat with almost every day would suddenly tell me my and my fianc\u00e9 presence was unwelcomed because of our orientation. In 2015! I wanted to see them after a year of them being gone, I wanted to see my nephews and have Thanksgiving with them. \n\nShe snubbed us. We had thanksgiving at an outback. I stopped talking to her for MONTHS and she wouldn\u2019t even initiate a conversation. About two years later she reached out to apologize and I forgave her, but our relationship was completely changed. We don\u2019t chat anymore, our interactions are short (I grey rock her) and I\u2019ve only seen them twice since then and very briefly. \n\nShe hurt me so deeply that it showed me that she was just an ally when it was convenient for her, and I would never put myself in the situation where she would be able to fuck me over that way. \n\nYou\u2019re the asshole. No matter how many times you apologize the damage was done. It\u2019s like gluing a broken vase, you\u2019ll always see the cracks, and you were 29?! Twenty-nine? When you ditched her fiance funeral?! You should be lucky she even answers the phone.", "YTA\n\nReally? Taylor Swift is more important than your sister?", "YTA. She's not holding a grudge. Your selfish actions irreparably damaged your relationship. The fact that you were 29 when you did this makes me think she's definitely right to not want to be close to you again.

Just because you say you have apologised countless times doest mean she has forgotten about it.

I\u2019m shocked she even speaks to you.", "You were 29 when this happened!? Absolutely unforgivable! You make it sound like you were a teen who doesn\u2019t fully grasp right and wrong, the importance of putting someone ahead of yourself! TWENTY NINE years old and you didn\u2019t see how majorly messed up that was at the time!? \nIt\u2019s a miracle she even speaks to you! \nYou irreversibly destroyed your relationship with your sister. Over a concert. This is the consequence. You will never have the relationship you had. It\u2019s done. You burnt that bridge.", "Wait, you said you were young and dumb but you were 29?!?! You'd been a fucking adult for over 10 years at that point! I'd never forgive you either", "I knew you left out the ages for a reason. Claimed you were \"young\" when you pulled that shit when you were almost 30 years old, absolutely ridiculous. The fact that you purposefully left out exactly how old you were while saying that you were young (implying that you were in your late teens/early twenties based on the lack of maturity that would cause someone to pull the bullshit you did) just proves that you still aren't taking this seriously.", "Whoa. So you were 29 or 30 when this happened?! That's not a case of \"I was young and didn't have my priorities straight.\" That's 100% \"I'm a self centered asshole who only cares about me.\"\n\nYou should be grateful she's speaking to you at all now. You abandoned your sister during the absolute worst moment of her life to go to a concert. No artist is that important. He drix could have come back from the dead to play a one night only show and I would have still been there for my sibling.\n\nYTA. You've shown no true remorse over your actions and will forever be an asshole.", "You were knocking on THIRTY when you skipped your BIL's funeral for a fucking Taylor Swift concert??????\n\nLet me help you, since you can't seem to accept a \"non-straight\" answer from Jane about where you stand: things are really bad, and she may never forgive you, tbh. Whether or not you are sorry or regret it.", "You\u2019re disgusting. You no longer have a sister, you have an acquaintance.", "Says a lot that your behavior is something to be expected of a teenager but you were 29 and should've known WAY better. YTA.", "you were in your late 20s when you did that?!\n\nOf course she will never *ever* let this go. Stop asking her to. Stop asking her to make time for you. Be grateful she is willing to interact with you at all", "You are way way too old for thinking it\u2019s ok to be a self centered asshole for the last 5 years.", "Lmao you are older and a straight up adult when you chose Taylor Swift over family", "If at 29 you couldn\u2019t grasp the gravity of the situation, you\u2019ll never grasp it now at 32. You\u2019re broken, you\u2019re ruined. \n\nYoull need so much therapy and help to even begin to understand why you arent worth maintaining a relationship with. Maybe one day you\u2019ll get it, but you need to put in so much work to get there, and you seem too selfish to do it.", "Wow. No I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s unforgivable. OP you were very misleading saying you were \u201cyounger\u201d then. Obviously you were younger than you are today but you were not in a young, stupid, my frontal lobe isn\u2019t fully formed phase. That\u2019s truly horrible.", "Who says that kid liked his stepdad  though?", "oh you mean the man who served time in prison for stalking a complete stranger", "Same!!", "No, I stand by what I said. Taylor Swift makes it that much worse", "It matters because it's at least the third AITA I see with a Taylor Swift fan being a big asshole since yesterday, which means it's fake, and somebody is just having fun bashing TaySwift.", "Exactly. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re upset that I didn\u2019t come to your fianc\u00e9\u2019s, who happens to be the father of your unborn child\u2019s, funeral.\u201d", "I noticed that, too", "Apologies without actions are bullshit designed to alleviate guilt.\n\nYTA", "Yes! This is something I learnt when I was in NA. I did some pretty awful stuff when I was using, so when it got to step 9 to make amends my sponsor told me that you can sincerely apologise and mean it from the bottom of your heart but that does not mean the person you're apologising to has to accept your apology. That took a lot for me to understand, because I thought if I say sorry it's all forgiven. But I eventually learned that saying sorry doesn't mean you're forgiven, people are complex. \nSounds like OPs sister can't get past what she did, not truly, and OP needs to really understand this. \nWhat she did really hurt her sister on such a deep level.", "No I said that because that's what I thought at the time, not now, and I realized I was wrong", "OP did this at 29??! Honestly there is no age where doing this would be normal. But 29!??", "I just read through her comments to find this, because I assumed she was maybe 16 when that happened. But 29? OP, stop expecting her to forgive you just because you apologized. You're still acting like a spoiled, entitled brat. She'll forgive you if and when she's ready, not when you decide she should. And honestly, your relationship will probably never be the same.", "This comment made me go find where she mentioned her age.......SHE'S THE OLDER SISTER!!! She blew off her pregnant younger sister's fiance's funeral. It was awful to begin with, but that makes it worse for me.", "Omg I assumed OP was like 15 when she did that! What kind of adult chooses a concert over someone they love who is at their lowest and needs them?!", "I mean, I like Taylor Swift, but you still get an upvote from me because I can't imagine ever, at any point in my life, missing my pregnant sister's fiance's funeral for a concert, no matter how obsessed I may have been with the artist. That's an incredibly selfish move. OP clearly realizes now what she did was wrong, but the fact that she couldn't realize it at the time, regardless of her age, shows what kind of person she is. OP doesn't say how old she is, but even if she was a teenager at the time, teenagers are perfectly capable of being decent, empathetic humans. Maybe she has grown and changed now, but that doesn't change the past or the hurt she caused.\n\nYTA", "Wait until you find out OP was 29 years old when she ditched her sister to see T Swift. And OP's older than her sis...", "She\u2019s gotta take a look what she\u2019s done", "Lol yeah. Would have played look what you made me do in full blown stereo and off her with sleep deprivation.", "As the eldest sister, this grates at me. If the love of my little sister\u2019s life and the father of her child died, I wouldn\u2019t be anywhere else in the world but by her side. The only thing that could pry me away from her side is death itself. \n\nI literally have no words cause all I would say are mean things that would hurt OPs feelings", "I legitimately thought she must have been 20. And I was wondering why the parents didn't raise hell. 29!", "Holy shit, I guess I wasn\u2019t paying attention but assumed OP was the younger sibling and like 20 when this happened.", "Omg OP is the elder sister?! \n\nChrist on a cracker, she's a gigantic AH.", "Oh I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t that fussed given he was straight onto Only Fans after asking for thoughts and prayers.", "Certainly not his behaviour.", "I showed up to funerals for people I disdained because I loved the people who were there and needed support. He could have thought of his mom.", "Does he like his mom though, the woman married to the guy?", "That was my point!!!! Everyone's all mad but they don't know!", "You entitlement in this thread makes me think you haven\u2019t realized how wrong you were. You feel more sorry for yourself than horrified by your selfishness. Reflect harder. Act better. You\u2019re not there yet.", "Do you understand that you have hurt her very deeply? Beyond 'I'm sorry'. \n\nIf my sister had done that to me, I would have a hard time forgiving her EVER. You're not the person she thought you were - the person in her corner. \n\nPerhaps you should acknowledge that this is a relationship that will take years to repair. You need to give her space and tell her that you understand - but only if you truly do. I don't think you've really been introspective because you're essentially saying 'can't you get over it?!' \n\nIf you were the person that she wanted in her corner, you would be asking how you can help her, checking how she's feeling. Instead, you seem to be focused on the fact that's she's not there for you. You're still thinking about yourself.", "You were 29 when you did that. You are pathetic.", "It kind of seems to me that she reached out with the intention of holding onto that grudge and using your own line against you as a reason for not being completely present for milestone events.\n\nWhile that's not the most mature way of handling things (I'm not saying it's completely immature because she *did* show up to your wedding and she *did* give a gift basket for your baby), what you did, albeit years ago, was incredibly self-centered.\n\nIt's also possible that she's just trying her best to remain as civil as possible.\n\nYes, you've apologized, but you also expect her to put on a brave face from start to finish for your wedding after her loss.\n\nWhile it's sad that she won't move her schedule around to see her niece, take this as a very strong hint that your relationship will never recover from your choice to see a concert rather than be there for your sister when she needed you most.\n\nYou have to look at it this way: nothing will be the same. Expecting her to keep that trusting and loving sister energy when you abandoned her is unrealistic and she's been telling you that through her actions.\n\nStop asking/expecting things to be as they were just because you apologized a lot.\n\nYou fucked up. Accept that she can't trust you the same way as before. It's not that hard.", "I hope this is true.", "You\u2019re still wrong.", "She is also the oldest sister as well.  The OP left her younger sister to deal with grief.  Yes, she was 29", "My thoughts exactly. I\u2019d initially thought she might have been 15 when she did this and that might make it a bit more forgivable. \n\nOP YTA for all the reasons already posted here.", "She is also 2 years older than her sister", "It would be normal at like age 15, to be fair.", "OP was incredibly misleading in her post. She mentions she made the choice to go to the concert when she was younger and she\u2019s grown since then blah blah blah, but if you aren\u2019t paying close attention (or don\u2019t know or care when the fuck the reputation tour was) you\u2019d think she was 19/20 at the time. Which I did. \n\nStill downplaying it, huh OP? YTA", "OP was 29 when she ditched her sister for a concert.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine this was the first time she was so self-absorbed. It was just the last straw for her sister.", "Cause now they\u2019ve got bad blood (hey!)", "yeah I was like \"it sucks but 16yr olds are selfish sometimes\"", "We all grieve in different ways. /s", "Maybe he hates he too lol", "Maybe she just needs to apologize 4 or 5 more times and that will do?", "Right? That\u2019s the actions of a damn 14 year old, not someone pushing 30. Honestly it\u2019s even more disgusting.", "Wait, what? She wasn't 16?", "I missed that part.i was thinking she was 18ish...\n\nNow I'm doubling down on my vote", "Can we get this upvoted!!! So everyone realizes that this was a grown adult woman!!!", "I think this is it. I think her sister needs to tell OP where she is but I think OP just needs to accept her sister is no longer her friend or close sibling and that she can no longer rely on her for that relationship.", "Now they have problems and I don't think we can solve em", "I thought she had to be under 18 but not almost 30 AND the older sister!", "Right? She says she is 34 now. That happened 5 years ago. She's a horrible human", "Yeah, she made it seem like she was 16 or 17, NOT almost  30", "OP made a really deep cut"]}
