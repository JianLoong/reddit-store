It was extremely tough on me and my entire family. I was her only child and was very close with her. \n\nMy dad M(46) got re married a little over one year after my moms death. It wasn\u2019t easy for me to accept that my dad has to move on. He got married pretty soon into his relationship which was also not easy for me to come to terms with. His wife F(35) was one of his former co workers and she\u2019s nice but has been a little pushy for me and her to have a relationship. I definitely didn\u2019t like her in the beginning because I was still not done grieving my mother. \n\nHer and my dad have 2 kids together and sometimes when we\u2019re in public or in social settings they obviously call her mom but I call her by her name. She\u2019ll say you can call me mom and I say thank you and don\u2019t because she isn\u2019t my mom. In the beginning she talked my dad into removing all of my mom\u2019s pictures in the house, we didn\u2019t but her asking rubbed me the wrong way. We moved from our old house and the only pictures of my mom are in my room now which I\u2019m ok with.\n\nRecently my 17th birthday passed. We had a little party at the house just the family and my step grandparents and her sister. After we did dinner and had cake they all set up a surprise in the living room. My dad and her were sat on the couch and my s-aunt was recording. The surprise was her asking to adopt me and become my mom. I didn\u2019t instantly react but I just started crying I couldn\u2019t control it. I didn\u2019t say anything and walked away. Later that night my dad came to talk to me and said I should accept her proposal and merge the family. He told me locking myself in my room and not saying anything to her was rude and I told him I wasn\u2019t accepting bc I have a mom and don\u2019t need her to replace her. I felt it was wrong in my heart and that I\u2019ve accepted she\u2019s my step mom but I don\u2019t have to call her mom or act like I\u2019ll ever love her as a mom. \n\nThe next morning he told me she cried and I need to apologize for how I reacted and reconsider my decision. I spoke with her that day and explained how I didn\u2019t want to do it and she said she\u2019s very hurt and that it\u2019s rude of me to not accept her even after so many years. I feel like accepting would be like erasing my mom from my life I know she\u2019s not here but giving my step mother that title feels wrong.", "created_utc": 1679104871, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ubcku/aita_for_not_wanting_my_step_mom_to_adopt_me_and/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is manipulative and incredibly cruel of them. She did this on your birthday, in front of an audience on purpose because she was trying to trap you into saying yes. The best advice I can give you is to work on emotionally distancing yourself from them and focus on moving out ASAP.  Your dad, I fear, will never have your back the way that you need him to but perhaps if you were to go to therapy together, that might help? Your step mother sounds truly awful. I'm sorry about your mum xx", "Absolutely NTA. She could ask, sure, but this is YOUR choice. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that the adults in your life are forcing this on you. It doesn\u2019t sound like you did anything wrong. Do you have any other family that you talk to? Maybe your mom\u2019s side of the family?", "NTA. Its only been 5 years since you lost your mom in a truly devastating and traumatic way. There is no schedule on grief and just because your father was able to move on so quickly does not mean you should. They should be ashamed of themselves at trying to coerce you into this.", "Nta. Your dad and step mom are the assholes. They should have known you wouldn't want that. That's what step mom wants. Not appropriate to have brought it up as some sort of \"present\". \n\nYour dad is the asshole for asking you to apologize and to accept. Your step mom is the asshole for trying to push for it, esp when you're 17. I wouldn't trust her to not have ulterior motives for it. Like idk but maybe legally if she was to adopt you and your dad to pass, it would make it where she gets everything as opposed to you and her having to share . (Not a lawyer I don't know just seems funky)", "NTA.  Your Dad and his wife are, though.  They knew you didn't want her to adopt you but thought that if they surprised you in front of a crowd that you would cave in.  They should be doing the apologizing.  Stand your ground.   Make sure that you have duplicate or digital copies of your pictures of your mom.  No telling what they might do in retaliation.  They probably figure they now have less than a year to wear you down.", "NTA\n\nYou *have* accepted her: As your stepmother. That's what she is to you, and that's okay.\n\nFor them to push you in this way is horrible. \n\nI'm so sorry that you lost your mom. And I'm sorry that you were pressured to get through it before you were ready.\n\nI agree with the other comment about distancing yourself even more. \n\nAnd I hope things aren't too bad there until you can get out of her sphere of influence.", "Oh, you poor thing!  You are absolutely NTA, not at all.  They ambushed you, OP, and that makes them TA here.  They should never have done that to you.  You are NOT responsible for \u201cmerging the family\u201d.  They don\u2019t get to put that on you.  I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this.  You are allowed to love your mom and hold her in your heart.  They should encourage it, not try to stop it.", "NTA. Your feeling are entirely valid, and it doesn\u2019t sound like your dad really listened to you at all. A lot of people feel the exact same way as you.", "NTA. It was really calculating of them to \"surprise\" you with this at a family gathering  instead of talking to you privately. You can let her know you appreciate her without being adopted. I'm sure her feelings are hurt, but that's not your fault.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t feel it\u2019s right, don\u2019t do it. I understand your position except it was my dad who passed away. It doesn\u2019t erase them but you do what feels right to you.", "NTA If she genuinely cared about you, she would want to do what makes you happy -- instead, she only cares about herself.", "Ugh! Your father and stepmother are the absolute worst! Putting you on the spot like that. On your own birthday.\n\nAnd no, you are not being rude by saying no to a relationship you don\u2019t want. NTA.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not as if your mom passed away while you were an infant.  You definitely had an established relationship with her and hold her memory close to your heart.  Its one thing to want a bonded family but she really backed you into a corner by the method in which she presented the option.  It\u2019s troubling that your dad seemed more concerned about her crying instead of taking your feelings into consideration.", "NTA.  You\u2019re still grieving your mom (I\u2019m so sorry) and there\u2019s no time limit to that.  This woman is not your mom.  Your dad and your stepmom are definitely TAs for expecting you to just go along with this.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry", "NTA. It\u2019s not rude, it\u2019s how you feel. Don\u2019t let them negate your feelings. They are emotionally manipulating you. Ask them to stop. Trying to force a relationship doesn\u2019t work, it has to grow organically", "NTA\n\nStep-mom is an AH but your dad putting all that guilt and pressure on you is the biggest AH here.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry for your loss and that you\u2019re in this situation. So sick of reading about steps, boyfriends and girlfriends feeling entitled to the descriptors of mom and dad by simply existing in your home.", "Send your dad this link and let him read it cause he is so wrong.  Plus, as an adult, I'm suspect about a few things.\n\nWas there an insurance payout or a wrongful death suit?  I'm wondering if some of this is actually yours because you were a minor.  Especially things like SSI.\n\nI don't buy the relationship timeline. \n\nLast, your smom could be a friend and mentor, but it doesn't require her to take your mom's spot.\n\nOf course NTA", "NTA. In any way.\n\nIn proud of you for refusing to answer. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do the same when I was 17.\n\nThat was an incredibly shitty situation for them to put you in. I don\u2019t think you have anything to apologize for\u2026they do.\n\nYour mom is always going to be your mom. And love you so so deeply.  \n\nAs a mom, I know I\u2019d want my own daughter to find peace if I was gone, but I lost my dad and I\u2019m still trying. It\u2019s really really hard. Time softens it but I still have things happen and think, \u201coh I can\u2019t wait to tell dad!\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that they sprung this on you, I do not think it\u2019s appropriate.  Keep doing what you feel is right.  Your mom is always with you in your heart and in your memories.", "NTA\n\nwhat? \n\nYour dad sounds sus, especially for marrying so soon after your mom passed... You don't need to accept someone as your mom just because they're married to your dad. It doesn't sound like you're mean to her or anything either. How long until you're 18? It's weird that she's bringing up adoption papers now, especially when you don't even call her mom.", "NTA", "NTA.  They need to apologize to you.  Their public production was a terrible way to suggest the adoption.  That really should have been done privately with you, your stepmother and your father.  Frankly, I am rather baffled that they would even suggest the idea since you do not even call her mom and are 17 years old.", "NTA\n\nWhat is wrong with the adults in your life?\n\nYour father and stepmom actually thought you'd agree to be adopted by a woman whom you've refused to call \"Mom\" for your entire relationship!\n\n I'm wondering if they were hoping to social pressure you into saying yes and then use the video recording against you in court when you try to back out later, like \"I know she's saying 'No' to the adoption right now in front of you, Judge, but that's because we just got into a  fight. She really does want the adoption. Just watch this video where she said 'yes'. \"", "NTA. Your dad and step mom are TA!!!!!! It\u2019s absolutely revolting what they are doing to you.", "NTA.  It is not your job to make your stepmom feel good.  It is not your job to soothe her ego.  You are not a pet, you are a whole human being.\n\nShe's supposed to be an adult and instead of being a parent she is acting like you're responsible for her mental state.  Afaic, this is akin to parentification.\n\nYou are a CHILD.  A parent supports and nurtures a child, not the other way around.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss, and that you're dealing with assholes on top of it.", "NTA, at all.  You are right to feel how you feel, and not want what you don't want.  They're both horrible for tryingnto force this on you.  I do agree with someone else's thought on money involved.  I would see what you can find out about that as well.  Ask your grandparents about that, as well as asking for a lawyer if there was something financial from your mom's passing.  A lawyer can make sure no one has touched what is yours.  I wouldn't trust your father or your stepmother at this point.  They tried to force your hand by doing that in front of other people.  Sending you virtual hugs.", "NTA. So glad your grandparents are stepping up", "NTA You don\u2019t have to replace your mom.

My mom made the rules for me & my sisters (though if it cost money, stepdad had a say since they shared finances).\n\nI do address him as my dad now, but it's a different circumstance to yours -- I was not close to my dad at all, and have few memories of him, despite being 11 when he died. My stepdad has been in my life more than twice as long as my real dad was (and counting). He was the one who was there for me, who supported me financially and emotionally, he was the one who walked me down the aisle and danced with me when I got married. And I didn't start referring to him as 'Dad' until I was over 30. It took 20 years.\n\nNTA - it might have been different if your mom had died before you had real memories of her, and your step mom actually raised you, and acted like your mom all or most of your life.
