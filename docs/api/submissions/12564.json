It was extremely tough on me and my entire family. I was her only child and was very close with her. \n\nMy dad M(46) got re married a little over one year after my moms death. It wasn\u2019t easy for me to accept that my dad has to move on. He got married pretty soon into his relationship which was also not easy for me to come to terms with. His wife F(35) was one of his former co workers and she\u2019s nice but has been a little pushy for me and her to have a relationship. I definitely didn\u2019t like her in the beginning because I was still not done grieving my mother. \n\nHer and my dad have 2 kids together and sometimes when we\u2019re in public or in social settings they obviously call her mom but I call her by her name. She\u2019ll say you can call me mom and I say thank you and don\u2019t because she isn\u2019t my mom. In the beginning she talked my dad into removing all of my mom\u2019s pictures in the house, we didn\u2019t but her asking rubbed me the wrong way. We moved from our old house and the only pictures of my mom are in my room now which I\u2019m ok with.\n\nRecently my 17th birthday passed. We had a little party at the house just the family and my step grandparents and her sister. After we did dinner and had cake they all set up a surprise in the living room. My dad and her were sat on the couch and my s-aunt was recording. The surprise was her asking to adopt me and become my mom. I didn\u2019t instantly react but I just started crying I couldn\u2019t control it. I didn\u2019t say anything and walked away. Later that night my dad came to talk to me and said I should accept her proposal and merge the family. He told me locking myself in my room and not saying anything to her was rude and I told him I wasn\u2019t accepting bc I have a mom and don\u2019t need her to replace her. I felt it was wrong in my heart and that I\u2019ve accepted she\u2019s my step mom but I don\u2019t have to call her mom or act like I\u2019ll ever love her as a mom. \n\nThe next morning he told me she cried and I need to apologize for how I reacted and reconsider my decision. I spoke with her that day and explained how I didn\u2019t want to do it and she said she\u2019s very hurt and that it\u2019s rude of me to not accept her even after so many years. I feel like accepting would be like erasing my mom from my life I know she\u2019s not here but giving my step mother that title feels wrong.", "created_utc": 1679104871, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ubcku/aita_for_not_wanting_my_step_mom_to_adopt_me_and/", "score": 1085, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is manipulative and incredibly cruel of them. She did this on your birthday, in front of an audience on purpose because she was trying to trap you into saying yes. The best advice I can give you is to work on emotionally distancing yourself from them and focus on moving out ASAP.  Your dad, I fear, will never have your back the way that you need him to but perhaps if you were to go to therapy together, that might help? Your step mother sounds truly awful. I'm sorry about your mum xx", "Absolutely NTA. She could ask, sure, but this is YOUR choice. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that the adults in your life are forcing this on you. It doesn\u2019t sound like you did anything wrong. Do you have any other family that you talk to? Maybe your mom\u2019s side of the family?", "NTA. Its only been 5 years since you lost your mom in a truly devastating and traumatic way. There is no schedule on grief and just because your father was able to move on so quickly does not mean you should. They should be ashamed of themselves at trying to coerce you into this.", "Nta. Your dad and step mom are the assholes. They should have known you wouldn't want that. That's what step mom wants. Not appropriate to have brought it up as some sort of \"present\". \n\nYour dad is the asshole for asking you to apologize and to accept. Your step mom is the asshole for trying to push for it, esp when you're 17. I wouldn't trust her to not have ulterior motives for it. Like idk but maybe legally if she was to adopt you and your dad to pass, it would make it where she gets everything as opposed to you and her having to share . (Not a lawyer I don't know just seems funky)", "NTA.  Your Dad and his wife are, though.  They knew you didn't want her to adopt you but thought that if they surprised you in front of a crowd that you would cave in.  They should be doing the apologizing.  Stand your ground.   Make sure that you have duplicate or digital copies of your pictures of your mom.  No telling what they might do in retaliation.  They probably figure they now have less than a year to wear you down.", "NTA\n\nYou *have* accepted her: As your stepmother. That's what she is to you, and that's okay.\n\nFor them to push you in this way is horrible. \n\nI'm so sorry that you lost your mom. And I'm sorry that you were pressured to get through it before you were ready.\n\nI agree with the other comment about distancing yourself even more. \n\nAnd I hope things aren't too bad there until you can get out of her sphere of influence.", "Oh, you poor thing!  You are absolutely NTA, not at all.  They ambushed you, OP, and that makes them TA here.  They should never have done that to you.  You are NOT responsible for \u201cmerging the family\u201d.  They don\u2019t get to put that on you.  I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this.  You are allowed to love your mom and hold her in your heart.  They should encourage it, not try to stop it.", "NTA. Your feeling are entirely valid, and it doesn\u2019t sound like your dad really listened to you at all. A lot of people feel the exact same way as you.", "NTA. It was really calculating of them to \"surprise\" you with this at a family gathering  instead of talking to you privately. You can let her know you appreciate her without being adopted. I'm sure her feelings are hurt, but that's not your fault.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t feel it\u2019s right, don\u2019t do it. I understand your position except it was my dad who passed away. It doesn\u2019t erase them but you do what feels right to you.", "NTA If she genuinely cared about you, she would want to do what makes you happy -- instead, she only cares about herself.", "Ugh! Your father and stepmother are the absolute worst! Putting you on the spot like that. On your own birthday.\n\nAnd no, you are not being rude by saying no to a relationship you don\u2019t want. NTA.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not as if your mom passed away while you were an infant.  You definitely had an established relationship with her and hold her memory close to your heart.  Its one thing to want a bonded family but she really backed you into a corner by the method in which she presented the option.  It\u2019s troubling that your dad seemed more concerned about her crying instead of taking your feelings into consideration.", "NTA.  You\u2019re still grieving your mom (I\u2019m so sorry) and there\u2019s no time limit to that.  This woman is not your mom.  Your dad and your stepmom are definitely TAs for expecting you to just go along with this.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry", "NTA. It\u2019s not rude, it\u2019s how you feel. Don\u2019t let them negate your feelings. They are emotionally manipulating you. Ask them to stop. Trying to force a relationship doesn\u2019t work, it has to grow organically", "NTA\n\nStep-mom is an AH but your dad putting all that guilt and pressure on you is the biggest AH here.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry for your loss and that you\u2019re in this situation. So sick of reading about steps, boyfriends and girlfriends feeling entitled to the descriptors of mom and dad by simply existing in your home.", "Send your dad this link and let him read it cause he is so wrong.  Plus, as an adult, I'm suspect about a few things.\n\nWas there an insurance payout or a wrongful death suit?  I'm wondering if some of this is actually yours because you were a minor.  Especially things like SSI.\n\nI don't buy the relationship timeline. \n\nLast, your smom could be a friend and mentor, but it doesn't require her to take your mom's spot.\n\nOf course NTA", "NTA. In any way.\n\nIn proud of you for refusing to answer. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do the same when I was 17.\n\nThat was an incredibly shitty situation for them to put you in. I don\u2019t think you have anything to apologize for\u2026they do.\n\nYour mom is always going to be your mom. And love you so so deeply.  \n\nAs a mom, I know I\u2019d want my own daughter to find peace if I was gone, but I lost my dad and I\u2019m still trying. It\u2019s really really hard. Time softens it but I still have things happen and think, \u201coh I can\u2019t wait to tell dad!\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that they sprung this on you, I do not think it\u2019s appropriate.  Keep doing what you feel is right.  Your mom is always with you in your heart and in your memories.", "NTA\n\nwhat? \n\nYour dad sounds sus, especially for marrying so soon after your mom passed... You don't need to accept someone as your mom just because they're married to your dad. It doesn't sound like you're mean to her or anything either. How long until you're 18? It's weird that she's bringing up adoption papers now, especially when you don't even call her mom.", "NTA", "NTA.  They need to apologize to you.  Their public production was a terrible way to suggest the adoption.  That really should have been done privately with you, your stepmother and your father.  Frankly, I am rather baffled that they would even suggest the idea since you do not even call her mom and are 17 years old.", "NTA\n\nWhat is wrong with the adults in your life?\n\nYour father and stepmom actually thought you'd agree to be adopted by a woman whom you've refused to call \"Mom\" for your entire relationship!\n\n I'm wondering if they were hoping to social pressure you into saying yes and then use the video recording against you in court when you try to back out later, like \"I know she's saying 'No' to the adoption right now in front of you, Judge, but that's because we just got into a  fight. She really does want the adoption. Just watch this video where she said 'yes'. \"", "NTA. Your dad and step mom are TA!!!!!! It\u2019s absolutely revolting what they are doing to you.", "NTA.  It is not your job to make your stepmom feel good.  It is not your job to soothe her ego.  You are not a pet, you are a whole human being.\n\nShe's supposed to be an adult and instead of being a parent she is acting like you're responsible for her mental state.  Afaic, this is akin to parentification.\n\nYou are a CHILD.  A parent supports and nurtures a child, not the other way around.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss, and that you're dealing with assholes on top of it.", "NTA, at all.  You are right to feel how you feel, and not want what you don't want.  They're both horrible for tryingnto force this on you.  I do agree with someone else's thought on money involved.  I would see what you can find out about that as well.  Ask your grandparents about that, as well as asking for a lawyer if there was something financial from your mom's passing.  A lawyer can make sure no one has touched what is yours.  I wouldn't trust your father or your stepmother at this point.  They tried to force your hand by doing that in front of other people.  Sending you virtual hugs.", "NTA. So glad your grandparents are stepping up", "NTA You don\u2019t have to replace your mom.

My mom made the rules for me & my sisters (though if it cost money, stepdad had a say since they shared finances).\n\nI do address him as my dad now, but it's a different circumstance to yours -- I was not close to my dad at all, and have few memories of him, despite being 11 when he died. My stepdad has been in my life more than twice as long as my real dad was (and counting). He was the one who was there for me, who supported me financially and emotionally, he was the one who walked me down the aisle and danced with me when I got married. And I didn't start referring to him as 'Dad' until I was over 30. It took 20 years.\n\nNTA - it might have been different if your mom had died before you had real memories of her, and your step mom actually raised you, and acted like your mom all or most of your life.

What a fake, uncaring step mommy you have!  \n\nI hope she is reading this thread and realizes what a mistake she has made over the past 5 years in not working to develop a friendship with you instead of thinking she automatically gets to step into the mommy role.  If she had worked at being a friend to you, you may have developed some trust and respect for her.

It also drives me bonkers when the bio parent prioritises the step parents feelings over the child, it's messed up.\n\nHoney you are absolutely NTA, and you did nothing wrong. You don't owe either your father or his wife an apology, they owe you one. Don't let them trample over your boundaries, or make you feel like the villain.

That tells a lot about him.\n\nIt's perfectly understandable that you don't want to be adopted. \n\nAt 17yo, you are almost an adult.

If this was a Chines novel, the stakes of step-mom being behind the car accident would be 99.9% too (obviously it isn't, because that's just a fictional trope)... but definitely, the step-mom was at least already flirting with her dad when the mom was still alive.\n\nIt sucks she doesn't have maternal relatives with her, because she should be able to consult an attorney on possible inheritance/insurance conflicts the step-mom may be trying to get her hands on by becoming the legal mom.", "I would wait to be 18 and confront them about suspecting they were actually together before mom was killed and that's why dad has been ok with all the shitty things step-mom has done, starting by trying to erase mom's presence in your life.\n\nI can't just get this suspicion out of my head, it's not just the possible money/assets step-mom may steal from her if she gets adopted.", "YES.\nThey are too calculating.", "Yeah, ask him if he hated your mom so much he couldn't wait to bring in his mistress after she was brutally killed and now he lets her do as she pleases even thinks she can become your legal parent. \ud83d\ude20", "It looks like she wanted to do that even when her mom was alive. 1 year after her passing + co-worker, we've all read enough sub-reddits and know enough people to not suspect it.", "I'm glad you have someone that understands.

By then it will be too late.", "Hun, your grandparents may suspect the same thing I do or even know it: she was the mistress from the start.\n\nIt sucks you can reach out to your maternal family.

I lost my mom when I was a bit older than you, and the hole that leaves behind never really goes away because you'll go through all your big life events without her there (and nearly 2 decades later, I still see things that make me think of her). I'd riot if any woman my father saw after tried to even ask this in private, much less make it a spectacle on my birthday.", "This is a very valid concern. OP I would try to check with family on your mother's side, whether your mother had a will and left something to you. The timing of this \"surprise\" seems very suspicious to me, since you will be a legal adult soon and they know your feelings regarding your stepmom.\n\nDefinitely NTA. \n\nDon't agree to this. The way they went about it is manipulative and wrong in so many ways. I believe that things like adoptions or marriage proposals shouldn't be sprung on people out of nowhere as a \"surprise\". This is emotional manipulation to put someone on the spotlight in front of an audience, in hopes of them doing what you want. Awful! \n\nIf they really cared about your feelings there would have been a lengthy private conversation prior to this, and probably hints and talks over the years before that, and then if the other person agrees and would enjoy a grand gesture like that you can make a spectacle on their birthday. It's not something I would do, but maybe some people would like it.", "Very sad to hear how quick your father was to cast aside any memory of your mom, and that he was so eager to remarry and throw himself into the joy of a new relationship without (it seems) considering his daughter's feelings or needs.

She\u2019ll say you can call me mom and I say thank you and don\u2019t because she isn\u2019t my mom. In the beginning she talked my dad into removing all of my mom\u2019s pictures in the house, we didn\u2019t but her asking rubbed me the wrong way.

Or, rather, what is your relationship to stepmom outside of her just being \"the woman your dad replaced your mom with\" to you? How were you close with your mother in ways that you are not with your stepmom? \"Mom\" doesn't have to be such a literal term, and it seems clear that your stepmom is looking for your love, or, as you put it, your acceptance.\n\n>After we did dinner and had cake they all set up a surprise in the living room. My dad and her were sat on the couch and my s-aunt was recording. \n\nThis really rubbed me the wrong way. I don't think it was fair of them to gang up on you like that and I find it incredibly tacky that they had a camera on you like that like you're some kind of dog. Just from what you describe, it kind of feels as though stepmom and her family are into big displays or are just kind of pushy people and maybe you are not. Four years is enough time to learn how a young person prefers being treated/celebrated by someone who wants to call themselves your mom.\n\n>The next morning he told me she cried and I need to apologize for how I reacted and reconsider my decision. I spoke with her that day and explained how I didn\u2019t want to do it and she said she\u2019s very hurt and that it\u2019s rude of me to not accept her even after so many years. I feel like accepting would be like erasing my mom from my life I know she\u2019s not here but giving my step mother that title feels wrong.\n\n(See paragraph 1, how is it that his wife's feelings are something he needs to stand up for and not those of his daughter?) Your father and his new family are not being emotionally generous to you at all and acting as though they're the ones who need to be cared for when you're still essentially a child. It might be worth considering some of the questions in paragraph 2. Try to honestly reflect on your relationship to your stepmom thus far. Again, \"mom\" (unfortunately, unlike \"dad\" lol) is not just a title. She probably has a lot of pent-up feelings about not being called or acknowledged as someone other than the woman your father has remarried.

So sorry to hear about your mother's passing.", "Why everyone is concerned of her cries and not your's", "Ur dad and stepmom r being emotionally manipulative asking u apologize for how u reacted to being blindsided.

Your step-mother is very rude for trying to force this on you so many years after you've made it perfectly clear that you said no to anything more than what she already is. Plus, you're clearly still grieveing. The way she's been acting has rubbed me the wrong way. It's highly inappropiate, tacky, and disgusting honestly. How can you even get to know her enough to call her your mother anyways when it's clear she's not even making an effort to know you as a daughter and blatenly ignoring what you want.", "NTA. Your dad and stepmom are though.", "So you're supposed to apologize when she cried, but no one needs to apologize for hurting you? Definitely NTA.

I'm so sorry.", "NTA. I would consider telling your dad that trying to force you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do just to make his wife happy is damaging his relationship with you.

It\u2019s about your feelings too and it seems like that\u2019s the last thought.

I'm so sorry, and I'm glad you have grandparents who support you and your feelings. My littles lost their father and I remarried a few years later. My husband is a wonderful man who loves and supports all of us, but he is firmly stepdad especially to my oldest. Here are a couple things I've learned/seen: grief goes through many stages but it is lifelong; honoring and remembering a deceased parent is important and healthy; step-parents can be great friends and support systems (or not, unfortunately), but they're not replacement parents; any attempt to force or coerce kids to feel something they don't is destined for heartbreak city. \n\nSmall mantra suggestion for you: your feelings matter. your feelings matter.\n\nYour stepmom's?

This sounds EXTREMELY sus to me: she or both of them might want to screw you over inheritance from your mum, or she or both might want that she gets his inheritance if he passes. You being 17 leaves them a tiny period of time for your potential adoption by her until you are 18 and an adult legally, where you receive any inheritance from your mum that he may currently be guarding (if that's the term). You might not be even aware of the existence of any inheritance, since you were 12 when she passed.\n\nSince I gather you're American, inheritance laws differ by state as far as I'm aware, so def seek out an appointment with a lawyer **without telling your dad or stepmum**. You need to protect yourself in case somebody is trying to screw you over.\n\nIf you can't afford money for an appointment with a lawyer, save or ask your maternal grandparents for financial help, if that is an option. Or just simply keep on refusing the adoption, no harm can happen if you actually don't get adopted. Don't reveal your concern about inheritance to them, as they may become hostile and make your life hell until you move out. And PLEASE don't give in the pressure! I cannot imagine how hard it must be for you, but if it comes to that, better to legally emancipate from your dad and live with your maternal grandparents as they seem to support you.\n\nReally sorry for what happened to your mum.
