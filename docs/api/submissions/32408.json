So my friend has a cleaning business and as she\u2019s gained more work that she can\u2019t do all alone I\u2019ve been working for her.

During this time there\u2019s been plenty of times she\u2019s not paid for me some cleans, and other times where she\u2019s not paid me until weeks later, I\u2019m constantly having to ask to be paid and even after I ask it\u2019s days later she pays me. So 3 weeks ago she told me she was going to pay me more, brilliant I thought! So I\u2019ve since then done 2 cleans for her amounting to 6 hours work. After I done the work she told me she couldn\u2019t actually afford to pay me more so would be paying me \u00a360 for the work. I was fine I accepted it but I was annoyed. I asked when she would pay me and since then she\u2019s paid me \u00a320. I\u2019ve asked three times and I\u2019m still waiting for the rest. I think this is wrong of her and I\u2019m now refusing to work until I\u2019ve been paid.

They're taking advantage of the fact that you don't want to ruin the friendship so won't push as hard, bring legal action, or quit like any other employee would.\n\nI'd gather as much documentation as you can to prove the hours you worked, how much you got paid, and what you are still owed.

You've given them the one thing you can't get more of - your time - and they're treating like it's nothing.\n\nNTA. Don't work for free, and get the other money she owes you.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" is using you and literally stealing your wages that she promised. Try to find a different employment, if you have experience with cleaning work there are usually agencies that are also looking for employees for that. And confront your friend. Tell her, calmly but clearly, that you are working for her without being paid on time and this is ruining your friendship and relationship. If she cannot be a just employer, you will look for employment elsewhere before this has completely destroyed your relationship.", "NTA, no pay no work, otherwise she will continue to take advantage.", "Stop working for your friend.   Demand payment, and then don't go back.  She's not a friend at all.  She's a user.  NTA", "NTA.
