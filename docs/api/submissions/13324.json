I know you're in a hard situation right now but we had a similar thing not too long ago. My grandma, who was living alone for the past 25 years after my grandpa died, had some kind of \"dementia attack\" (idk how to translate it to english; basically her condition suddenly worsened drastically) and from one moment to the next she was unable to stay in her home any longer. We had no alternative but to take her in, even though our house doesn't have any guest rooms. \n\nWhat we ended up doing was having my grandma sleep on the pullout sofa in the living room and my father (her son) on a mattress on the floor next to her. He also switched to working remotely during that time, so she was never alone, until we found a spot in a nursing home for her. At no moment during that time was it even up for debate that me, my sister or my mother had to give up or share our private spaces.\n\nHaving someone elderly sleep in the living room isn't cruel but sometimes the best solution for everyone involved - but it seems like your parents simply don't want to be inconvenienced and try to pressure/guilt you into giving in so they don't have to change anything for themselves.", "You guys should move to a three bed...", "NTA.

Is the only option throwing him in a ditch?\n\nPretty sure your mother was hoping to delegate a lot of the responsibility of caring for your grandfather on you, because that would definitely be the result of putting him in your room.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMAybe you can stay with aunt?", "NTA. It\u2019s her father, not yours. If she wants to move him in, she can move him into HER room or make space in the basement or living room.
