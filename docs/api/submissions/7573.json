I lived there for over 40 years, but I can only go back in the winter because my allergies are so severe. Read up on the unpredictability of allergies, your family does NOT realize they are actually harming your health with the cats. Try to keep your room as cat free as possible so at least you have a place that you can somewhat let your body get away from the allergens. \n\nHere is just one link on the unpredictability of allergies, I urge you to learn more. Go to MEDICAL websites, not some youtube fly by night kind of \"mind over matter\" type of place. Allergies can KILL YOU, they can also be VERY MILD and never get worse, but you NEVER KNOW,  because the human immune system is one of the least understood things in medical science today.

Not your cats not your responsibility Of course you brother and sister think your an AH they are children and want someone else to cover their responsibilities...but it is their responsibility not yours. Notice Mum the adult in the house agrees with you.\n\nI would suggest you keep your bedroom door shut. There is no reason for cats to be in there. Cats also don't like certain smells eucalyptus, lavender, lemongrass, and peppermint pick one you like the smell of and get some essential oils and mark your door way or have a diffuser. Lavender is great for bedding because it's a sleep herb. Don't get them directly onto your skin without a carrier oil They also don't like white vinegar or Rosemary or Thyme.\n\nBit of cat behaviour advice.....The tendency if you don't like cats is to not look at them normal human reaction. In cat language that is actually very polite and nice come over here. That's why cats always end up sitting on the person who doesn't like them.  If you want to keep the cats away from you stare at them. Eyeball them often and regularly.

I love cats like crazy so I get your mom and siblings. I brought home my first cat unannounced and it worked out fine, but I imagine it would\u2019ve caused some strife if anyone had been allergic. It\u2019s inconsiderate of them to ask you to take care of them and they should understand if you want to limit your interaction with them. I think your siblings will understand when they are older.

He was my shadow, followed me everywhere, slept on or in my bed, ate only when and where I ate. He woukd curl up, watching tv together etc He would even walk to the corner shop with me and back. Whenever I was low, he was always there, purring. I miss having that friendship", "NTA but keep your bedroom door shut.  Don't let cats in your bed where you sleep.

I don\u2019t think you should have to take care of them at all but I also don\u2019t think a kid should have veto power over bringing pets into the home. If you are allergic, then they should have considered that and not brought them home. A rubber doorstop does wonders. Also, you can get a flip latch for 50 cents from Home Depot and install it on your door to keep them out while you\u2019re home. Conversely, if your door doesn\u2019t latch right, you may just need to adjust the screws on the strike plate.", "Ahh hell, NTA. I have pretty bad cat allergies & my parents got cats after I moved out. But they always at least make sure to vacuum and keep them out of the spare rooms when I come over. I love cats, but living with them and my allergies are a pain, so I really sympathize. \n\nI think you should talk to your mom about how to manage better with the allergies. If yours aren\u2019t awful, then they can probably be mitigated with being diligent. For example\u2014-not cats in your room. Get a door stopper, lock, whatever you need. If they\u2019re shedding hair where you sleep, that\u2019s gonna make things worse. Are you taking any kind of medication? If not, I would look into getting some OTC allergy meds. Have a conversation with your mom about making sure the house is clean and as free of pet dander as you can make it. You can rope your siblings into helping out with that. After all, they wanted the cats, so\u2026.\n\nIf you want any more allergy maintenance tips, feel free to DM me.

It might be worth trying? NTA, in any case.", "NTA", "What the shit. Your family brought pets into the home when they know you are allergic? AND they are expecting you to care for them?\n\nMate, I'm so sorry this is happening to you. This kind of abusive behavior from family is NOT normal, and I hope you get to experience better as you grow older and forge your own relationships.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - The title is misleading and I was leaning YTA until I read the post.  They are not YOUR cats, they are the other family member's cats.  You should not have to take care of an animal that is not yours, and they should have \"Asked\" your feelings on it especially since you are allergic.", "NTA and get a lock for your room since it appears people are letting cats into it? Also ask your mom to go to the doctor and talk to them about allergy meds.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t buy them, they\u2019re not your cats, allergies don\u2019t just go away", "NTA lock your door", "NTA. My uncle has such bad seasonal allergies that he moved to a different state in the late 70s. Poor guy couldn\u2019t even drink a beer in our home state without his face swelling up (hops).

I don\u2019t blame him.\n\nYou should not have to be responsible for pets you didn\u2019t want. Period. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you can\u2019t talk about getting allergy meds, but see if you can find a free (general health) clinic in your area. They don\u2019t charge a fee, they are real doctors, and may even be able to supply you with the appropriate allergy meds. I hope this helps!", "NTA, not your cats, not your responsibility.

Why should OP welcome them in their life and tolerate some level of inconvenience when that was never their desire to begin with? OP doesn't even need to be allergic to renounce all responsibility for those animals. OP did not want the cats, did not vote for it, nor buy it. The pet owners are other able bodied people.

I\u2019m allergic to both cats and dogs. Had my druthers I\u2019d have a couple of both because animals are rad and I love them. And I did have dogs for ages, got by just fine with an allegra every day and just got cuddles anyway. (Allergy meds every day always isn\u2019t\u2026 great? For your body? But doable, for sure.)

Allergy testing showed that I had a fairly serious reaction to cat dander, and after moving out, I was happy to learn I don\u2019t have to carry tissues with me all the time.

Your allergies may never EVER get bad, but then again, they are really unpredictable. Mine sent me to the Emergency Room MANY times since I was just a toddler. My dad had the same type of pollen allergies and would have sneezing attacks, runny & stuffy nose and that's all. My dad's lessened as he got older, mine have gotten worse.

She may as well embrace the inevitable.", "But have your tried spending time with them?\n\nI was constantly itching for 16 years and had to have a lot of medication creams, but it was worth it.  \n\n\nCats can sense when they are not liked, but if you spend time, even just playing a feather with them, a ball, or whatever toy they have, its ....

While I don't think they need your permission to get cats, I do think you shouldn't help out with them and need to figure a way to keep them out of your room.

My roommates who are also in med school almost wanted to drag me to the ER because of anaphylaxis concerns. I used my inhaler and it got a little better, but my lungs were in pain for the rest of the day. \n \nYour parents don't know how bad your allergies are. And cat allergies can be really serious. It's kind if irresponsible to do this when they know yoi have an allergy", "NTA they are not your cats you are just sharing space with them,  you should be able to screen your windows and shut your door do they cannot get in your room.  You shouldn't be expected to look after them in any way.", "NTA They're not your cats.  You should keep your bedroom door shut to keep the cats out and give yourself a low-allergy place  to sleep and spend time.", "NTA", "Nta and honestly if it\u2019s your room by yourself I would lock them out of your room because you don\u2019t wanna deal with that shit when you sleep especially if you\u2019re allergic it\u2019s hard to breathe start locking them out of your room so they won\u2019t be here there at least you can run to your room if you do start getting overly allergic and I guess get some Benadryl but they decided to get the cats not you it\u2019s not your problem", "NTA.

Don't get pets if one household member living in the same house is allergic. NTA.", "I'm also \"mildly\" allergic.  What will really help is keeping them out of the room where you sleep.  That means the door stays shut, the bedding and carpet stays cat-hair free, and you get to breathe freely at least while you sleep.

If the cats aren\u2019t yours, then you shouldn\u2019t have to clean up after them.  I personally absolutely adore cats, but they do create work, of that I am well aware.

As for the mess the cat makes in your room, I recommend you keep your door closed, get a lock if you need to.\n\nAllergies are not nice, even mild symptoms will make you irritable.
