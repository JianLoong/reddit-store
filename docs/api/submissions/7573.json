I lived there for over 40 years, but I can only go back in the winter because my allergies are so severe. Read up on the unpredictability of allergies, your family does NOT realize they are actually harming your health with the cats. Try to keep your room as cat free as possible so at least you have a place that you can somewhat let your body get away from the allergens. \n\nHere is just one link on the unpredictability of allergies, I urge you to learn more. Go to MEDICAL websites, not some youtube fly by night kind of \"mind over matter\" type of place. Allergies can KILL YOU, they can also be VERY MILD and never get worse, but you NEVER KNOW,  because the human immune system is one of the least understood things in medical science today.

Not your cats not your responsibility Of course you brother and sister think your an AH they are children and want someone else to cover their responsibilities...but it is their responsibility not yours. Notice Mum the adult in the house agrees with you.\n\nI would suggest you keep your bedroom door shut. There is no reason for cats to be in there. Cats also don't like certain smells eucalyptus, lavender, lemongrass, and peppermint pick one you like the smell of and get some essential oils and mark your door way or have a diffuser. Lavender is great for bedding because it's a sleep herb. Don't get them directly onto your skin without a carrier oil They also don't like white vinegar or Rosemary or Thyme.\n\nBit of cat behaviour advice.....The tendency if you don't like cats is to not look at them normal human reaction. In cat language that is actually very polite and nice come over here. That's why cats always end up sitting on the person who doesn't like them.  If you want to keep the cats away from you stare at them. Eyeball them often and regularly.

I love cats like crazy so I get your mom and siblings. I brought home my first cat unannounced and it worked out fine, but I imagine it would\u2019ve caused some strife if anyone had been allergic. It\u2019s inconsiderate of them to ask you to take care of them and they should understand if you want to limit your interaction with them. I think your siblings will understand when they are older.

He was my shadow, followed me everywhere, slept on or in my bed, ate only when and where I ate. He woukd curl up, watching tv together etc He would even walk to the corner shop with me and back. Whenever I was low, he was always there, purring. I miss having that friendship", "NTA but keep your bedroom door shut.  Don't let cats in your bed where you sleep.

I don\u2019t think you should have to take care of them at all but I also don\u2019t think a kid should have veto power over bringing pets into the home. If you are allergic, then they should have considered that and not brought them home. A rubber doorstop does wonders. Also, you can get a flip latch for 50 cents from Home Depot and install it on your door to keep them out while you\u2019re home. Conversely, if your door doesn\u2019t latch right, you may just need to adjust the screws on the strike plate.", "Ahh hell, NTA. I have pretty bad cat allergies & my parents got cats after I moved out. But they always at least make sure to vacuum and keep them out of the spare rooms when I come over. I love cats, but living with them and my allergies are a pain, so I really sympathize. \n\nI think you should talk to your mom about how to manage better with the allergies. If yours aren\u2019t awful, then they can probably be mitigated with being diligent. For example\u2014-not cats in your room. Get a door stopper, lock, whatever you need. If they\u2019re shedding hair where you sleep, that\u2019s gonna make things worse. Are you taking any kind of medication? If not, I would look into getting some OTC allergy meds. Have a conversation with your mom about making sure the house is clean and as free of pet dander as you can make it. You can rope your siblings into helping out with that. After all, they wanted the cats, so\u2026.\n\nIf you want any more allergy maintenance tips, feel free to DM me.

It might be worth trying? NTA, in any case.", "NTA", "What the shit. Your family brought pets into the home when they know you are allergic? AND they are expecting you to care for them?\n\nMate, I'm so sorry this is happening to you. This kind of abusive behavior from family is NOT normal, and I hope you get to experience better as you grow older and forge your own relationships.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - The title is misleading and I was leaning YTA until I read the post.  They are not YOUR cats, they are the other family member's cats.  You should not have to take care of an animal that is not yours, and they should have \"Asked\" your feelings on it especially since you are allergic.", "NTA and get a lock for your room since it appears people are letting cats into it? Also ask your mom to go to the doctor and talk to them about allergy meds.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t buy them, they\u2019re not your cats, allergies don\u2019t just go away", "NTA lock your door", "NTA. My uncle has such bad seasonal allergies that he moved to a different state in the late 70s. Poor guy couldn\u2019t even drink a beer in our home state without his face swelling up (hops).

I don\u2019t blame him.\n\nYou should not have to be responsible for pets you didn\u2019t want. Period. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you can\u2019t talk about getting allergy meds, but see if you can find a free (general health) clinic in your area. They don\u2019t charge a fee, they are real doctors, and may even be able to supply you with the appropriate allergy meds. I hope this helps!", "NTA, not your cats, not your responsibility.

Why should OP welcome them in their life and tolerate some level of inconvenience when that was never their desire to begin with? OP doesn't even need to be allergic to renounce all responsibility for those animals. OP did not want the cats, did not vote for it, nor buy it. The pet owners are other able bodied people.

I\u2019m allergic to both cats and dogs. Had my druthers I\u2019d have a couple of both because animals are rad and I love them. And I did have dogs for ages, got by just fine with an allegra every day and just got cuddles anyway. (Allergy meds every day always isn\u2019t\u2026 great? For your body? But doable, for sure.)

Allergy testing showed that I had a fairly serious reaction to cat dander, and after moving out, I was happy to learn I don\u2019t have to carry tissues with me all the time.

Your allergies may never EVER get bad, but then again, they are really unpredictable. Mine sent me to the Emergency Room MANY times since I was just a toddler. My dad had the same type of pollen allergies and would have sneezing attacks, runny & stuffy nose and that's all. My dad's lessened as he got older, mine have gotten worse.

Put it on flat surfaces you want them to stay off.\n2. They absolutely hate citrus, especially orange, but mint and lavender (or other strong botanical scents) also work. You could get an air freshener plug-in and put it right next to the door. Don\u2019t use essential oils, though, because they can be highly toxic to cats.\n3. Since you don\u2019t have a lock yet, you could (with permission) probably install a hook-and-eye latch by yourself. That\u2019s what we use to keep our cats out of certain rooms\u2014they can unlock and open doors, so a lock might not be the ultimate solution for you \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n4. Alternately, since a hook-and-eye latch would have to be screwed *into* the doorway, another temporary option would be rigging a latch up with two heavy duty damage-free wall hooks and a sturdy rubber band. As long as they\u2019re attached properly, they should be able to withstand pressure from the cats.\n5. Also, yes, those motion-sensitive air canisters work wonders. If you put one inside the door, that would teach them that your room is off limits.\n\nGood luck! Your family should be taking your allergies seriously, it can be dangerous to ignore them. Particularly because not all allergic reactions resemble hay fever\u2014there are other symptoms that may have gone unnoticed.

I take allergy medicine but that's my choice, not everyone elses.)", "NTA but you do need to learn to shut your door.  If \u2018that\u2019 is not allowed then the cats need to be enclosed in a room.  Also \u2018try\u2019 liking the cats.  I have had cats (love them) and cats KNOW when someone dislikes cats and want to be all over them esp if have slight allergies.  Even antisocial cats are like this.  Now if you kept calling them over. Wanting to pet or cuddle they will run the other way", "Theyre not your cats. And your allergic to them. NTA", "You should be allowed to close your door to keep the allergens out.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nWe have 2 cats, and, the dander causes the same reaction, for me. BUT, I am an adult, and made the choice to rescue them, despite my allergies. Your mom insisting your allergies have passed, is insane, to me. And, quite selfish.", "Not just weird, but cruel.", "Really. How do they know what she is physically feeling???", "I agree NTA but I don\u2019t agree on calling a 10 and 13yo toxic over this.  They\u2019re wrong, but I feel like them being upset that OP doesn\u2019t want to be involved with the cats is partly just due to a child\u2019s mindset", "The OP Is 13 that\u2019s why I\u2019m not agreeing with everyone saying NTA.", "The allergen is usually proteins in the cat's saliva. (Hence why it's on the fur). It's why for a lot of us there's no such thing as a hypallergenic cat - yes, including breeds like sphinxes.", "Yeah my allergy went from \"pretty itchy and sniffly\" to \"out of school for a week,  cant breathe or sleep due to bronchitis\" with one unfortunate hike", "Hook latch will help that", "Use something with an orange smell. Or collect orange peels (like from tangerines) and make potpourri bowls using them. The strong orange smell will have them avoiding your room.", "OMG lol my husband was talking about doing that to our counter tops", "Just be careful of this and monitor your cats' reaction.  Citrus oils are very toxic to cats, but not all cats are repelled by it.  I tried lemon oil once and thankfully monitored my kitties' response closely, because while my older cat acted as expected, the younger cat *loved* the smell and was strongly attracted to it/wanted to lick it.  So that was very, *very* much not an option to keep her out of things she didn't belong in - like the Christmas tree, chewing Christmas tree lights.  Ultimately the tree just had a topper (a rather dapper hat) for her safety, lol.  A naked tree was better than a hurt cat, y'know?\n\nBut yeah, she does *not* have the typical/expected response to citrus oils, and that's potentially dangerous.", "Being around an allergen can make it worse. I\u2019d check with your doctor and get them to confirm the allergy, and to see what you can do to help with your symptoms. You also need to monitor your symptoms. If your allergy can be safely treated that\u2019s one thing, but if it gets worse rehoming them might have to be considered for your health.\nNTA", "NTA They are not your cats and you are allergic. Shame on your mom for acting like you are not. You should be able to keep your door closed to keep the cats out of your room.", "NTA- not your pets. Theirs. This is pretty clear and you explained it very well. Sneezing and itching are an allergic or intolerance response by your body. Get some allergy meds!", "**AITA For Not Helping Take Care Of** **~~My~~** **somebody elses Cats**\n\nFixed the title for you.", "NTA. \n\nYou shouldn't need to, but if you want to prove them wrong and you have insurance, ask for an allergy test. I'm pretty sure cat hair/dander/whatever it is will be included in the panel but let them know you're there because of cats, so they know it's the most important one. The test is easy, no.blood draw or anything like that. It feels like little, very light scratches on your back while they're doing the test. It's not painful, it's mildly uncomfortable but it doesn't take long and you'll have the safety of knowing exactly what you are allergic to so you won't get sick, with the added bonus of proving them wrong.\n\n It shouldn't matter, but do you think they may be a little more careful if they knew you truly were allergic? \nI feel like keeping your room cat free should be a priority. You shouldn't be laying in something your allergic to, trying to sleep. It *should* be the owners responsibility but it'll probably be on you to find a way to keep your door locked when you're not there.", "NTA, you are allergic to them and that is a valid reason. They invalidated your allergies which can be very dangerous. I feel your pain in a way. I once went to a friend's apartment and she had a cat. Around 30 or so minutes of being there I felt my eyes getting extremely watery but my mom didn't believe me. We left after an hour when I was sneezing like crazy and she finally believed me, but has still tried to get me to go back. Honestly I love cats and hate the fact I'm allergic to them.", "NTA since they aren\u2019t your cats. Is there any way to convince your family not to allow the cats outside? They shouldn\u2019t be allowed outside anyway and that would solve the mud problem.", "op=NTA\n\nmistitled--NOT your cats\n\nNot your cats--not your responsibility.", "NTA but the \u201cwithout my permission\u201d bit.\nYou don\u2019t say that you co-own this house (apologies if you do) so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s your mom\u2019s. Her house her rules, she doesn\u2019t need your permission for squat.", "Who's cays are they????? NOT YOURS, NOT YOUR PROBLEM.", "To be fair, some allergies do disappear over time (when I was a kid, I was allergic to sooooo many things, and almost all of them disapeared by the time I was 14.)\n\nThat said, not all of them do, and it's easy enough to find out.  A doctor can check to see if you're still allergic, or not.\n\nNTA though... OP's mom should have checked to confirm that the allergy was gone before getting cats.  Doing so was an AHish move on mom's part...", "It\u2019s her house but I think it\u2019s very irresponsible for a parent to bring an animal their child is allergic to into the house. Constant exposure can worsen the allergy and antihistamines might not be enough to handle it, or come with nasty side effects. I personally wouldn\u2019t want to care for an animal that\u2019s going to make me I\u2019ll either.", "TO cope with the allergens- You (or your mom) need to look into a room sized HEPA filter, and replacement filter cartridges.  And try taking Zyrtec to reduce allergic reaction symptoms.  It is the one antihistamine that supposedly does not cause drowsiness.  And  it may not work for you- but might be worth a try.\n\nAnd they are NOT your cats.  They are your mom's and siblings cats.  They can care for them- shut your door and keep them out.  They will fuss at a closed door at first- but over time, they adapt to not being allowed in certain rooms (cat owner for nearly 40 yr here- LOVE them.  But NO ONE else is responsible for their care but me).  And that was tru when I was 7 and got my first cat- I had to feed, water, and take care of litter daily. Only things mom and dad helped with was vet care. Your cat- your responsibility.  \n\nNOT your cat, not your responsibility!!! (NTA)", "This. I love cats, including my housemates', but I am very allergic.  It is understood by the whole house that the cats don't go in my room, especially not at night.  NTA for not wanting allergens in your own home, but decent housemates (family or otherwise) can find a compromise.\n\nIf these aren't your pets, why are you helping take care of them?  Isn't pet care traditionally the job of the kid who wants the pet in the first place?", "Hmm interesting. TIL", "Get a latch to make it stronger.  And put a chair in front of it when you are in there.", "Can you keep your door closed? I had a roommate who was allergic to cats but by keeping his door closed he had a cat free space.", "When I was a teenager my entire family decided to get a cat. Even dad was on board. I was not. \n\nI said clearly that I didn\u2019t want the cat & wouldn\u2019t look after the cat. And I never did - nor for the second cat either. \n\nCats were fine - they had many people to love & fuss over them, and empty their litter tray. \n\nI figured out when I left home that I\u2019d been allergic to the cats all those years (I guess I just assumed sneezing & itching was a normal part of growing up..!?) - so my subconscious maybe knew something from day 1\u2026!? :-)\n\nI didn\u2019t discover a love of pets until my 40s. Then I was willing to help with litter trays.", "Not your cats = not your problem.", "NTA. But I\u2019m wondering what tasks are required to take care of cats? I have 2, and other than dumping some food in their bowl, making sure they have water, and scooping the litter box a couple of times a week, they are pretty low maintenance. Surely the other 3 family members can manage it without your help? You should definitely talk to your mom about keeping the door to your room shut while you\u2019re away so the cats don\u2019t go in, and maybe ask her about getting you some kind of allergy pill so you don\u2019t itch or sneeze in common areas.", "[Purina Pro Plan LiveClear](https://www.chewy.com/purina-pro-plan-liveclear-adult/dp/302471?utm_source=google-product&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=12791446238&utm_content=Purina%20Pro%20Plan&utm_term=&gclid=Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr4_4WTRnToaB236STl-3CJ6pbRZuMd3TPlthgA2UEBd_SSYLIDoFuYaAsdKEALw_wcB) is catfood that reduces the allergens the cats create.

I grew up with cats my whole life, but things can change. Exposure can increase your reaction. I went through it myself.\n\nI learned there's a protein in the cats saliva and urine that causes an allergic reaction. For that reason, you should absolutely avoid the litter box. \n\nI hope you can get some relief!", "If closing the door is not an option, make bed and put a large sheet over entire bed, including pillows as soon as you get us. Cats will still get on bed, but you can just pull back the sheet when you go to sleep, which will help with both allergies and dirt.", "After you get the lock, wash all of your bed linen and give your room a good dust and vacuum.  You need to get all that hair/dander out of your environment.  I'm sorry you're going through this.  And your siblings are selfish little shits.", "Cats tend to hate the smell of oranges so if you can find an orange based air freshener or something you can spray a line of it on the opening to your room. Kinda like creating a barrier. Worked for my cats."]}
