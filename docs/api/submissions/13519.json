I just want to come back on here to give you guys an update! First and foremost before I go to the update, I just want to thank you all for your helpful advice. it really helped me and my fianc\u00e9 get a clearer perspective on what to do. Now for the update!\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I decided to just have a basic elopement. No celebration, no after dinner, nothing. We might go on a honeymoon afterwards. We aren\u2019t sure where to go, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fun with no drama! We also decided to postpone the date of our elopement for a later date. \n\nAs of the conversation with my mother: A couple days after I posted the original Reddit post, I talked to my mother. I told her I am not having my cousin at my wedding or any future important events of mine. I don\u2019t care that she will be upset, it\u2019s my day and I say who goes and who doesn\u2019t. After I told her, she just sat there in silence. When I mentioned everything my cousin did to me in the past and told her that she did nothing about it, she got defensive. She said she tried everything that she could but I really don\u2019t believe that.\n\nA couple days ago I went on a hike with my father (parents are divorced) and I told him the situation briefly. He decided to give me the full rundown about my mother\u2019s family. Which was a very long conversation. He did not hold back. To no surprise, my father said throughout the marriage with my mother, she always chose her siblings and her mother over my father and her children. There was no boundaries on my mothers side. Everyone was in everyone\u2019s business. He told me about the bullying I received from my cousin from his perspective. For a long story short, my cousin was a horrible child. \n\nHe told me it\u2019s not worth arguing with my mother about these things because she is delusional and she will always take the side of her siblings instead of her children.\n\nI\u2019m going to keep my distance from my family and keep working hard to save my money so I can move out for my mothers house. I understand now that I cannot be around my mother\u2019s side of the family at all. It would be a very unhealthy environment for my future children and husband. I don\u2019t want to make the same mistakes my mother made. I want to be the best role model my family could have. \n\nI will update more if there is anything else to update. I just wanted to thank you guys again for giving me the best advice to follow and keeping up with my story.

No one needs this kind of toxicity in their life.  You have to make your choices just as your mom made hers.

I hope you have a lovely wedding and a nice honeymoon!", "Good for you and good on your dad. After my mother passed, my dad filled me in on allllllllllll the family dirt. It really explained a lot of things that happened. It\u2019s a shame that things like this have to be kept under wraps to \u201ckeep up appearances\u201d.", "I'm glad you father was able to help you get clarity.", "Yay team elopement!  (We eloped back in 1995, and haven't regretted it even slightly since.)", "First and foremost, I'm really sorry for\neverything you've had to go through and the stuff you've found out. It can't have been easy. Clearly your mum has a lot of issues that she probably doesn't even realise. While that's really sad, good on you for realising the impact it has had on you and your dad, and the impact it could potentially have on your husband and kids in the future. \n\nI think you're absolutely doing the right thing. And I hope that you manage to move out of your mum's place ASAP so that you can start your new life with your husband. I wish you all the best!", "Elope.  Save your money", "Good for you. You and SO go somewhere neat like Hawaii and get married and have a romantic honeymoon.", "Blessings on your elopement. Do whatever makes you happy. So glad that you have more clarity on the big picture. Take care of yourselves.", "Congratulations!  We are also firmly on the \"tiny wedding team\" and I wouldn't change anything we did, even after over 25 years together.\n\n  \nToo often, people forget - it's about getting married, not about having a wedding. \n\nGood for you for having figured out your priorities and knowing what is important for you. Happy wishes for you both!", "I didn\u2019t elope but husband and I just had his parents and my mom at our wedding. It was what we wanted. His brother and my younger sister gave us some half-hearted shit about it for a time, but when they say \u201cwe weren\u2019t invited to their wedding\u201d we just agree and say no one was but the parents.\n\nWe had a big party months later and everyone got invited to that.

All the best!", "You damn well better update more!", "I know someone who got eloped. They picked a spot, got dressed up, bride had a bouquet, and they hired a photographer & officiant. The photos of her walking out from behind the trees (it was set in a forest) was beyond beautiful. They then had their own time afterwards. Yes, family was upset but the couple was happy.", "You\u2019re the kind of person that breaks toxic generational patterns. I\u2019m so proud of you.", "just curious why can't you move I. with your dad in the meanwhile you save your money?", "Good for you OP. Hope you get out of your mom's house very soon.", "Happy that finally someone from your family decided to clue you in cause this sounds like the type of info you would have benefitted having sooner... nonetheless looks like your mom is more the problem than her family and I'm really sorry that you have to deal with this instead of planning for a great party with your loved ones - she made her choice, nothing else to do other than move on and build your own healthier family.", ">She said she tried everything that she could\n\nNext time (*if there is a next time*) she says something like that, ask for examples.\n\n\"You tried everything you could? Okay, \"everything\" is a lot, so tell me 5 things you did to try and stop her bullying? Better yet, tell me 3, Go ahead, i'll wait......\"\n\nI can promise you that she won't be able to tell you 1 thing other than \"i told her to be nice\" (*or something similar*).\n\n>My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to just have a basic elopement. No celebration, no after dinner, nothing.\n\nIf that's truly what you both want, Go for it, have fun and enjoy it.\n\nBut if it's to not have to deal with the BS of the \"family\".......fuck em, just don't invite them, hire security to keep your wedding safe from them.\n\nBut either way, ENJOY it!!!", "Thank you so much! :)", "It was definitely an eye opener. So much stuff that I didn\u2019t even know about came into light. My mothers side of the family is like a \u201ccult\u201d. I always thought it was normal for them to be in each others business and make people forgive each other in the circles for the sake of family, until I realized it wasn\u2019t.", "I told my mom i was going to go visit my husband. I came back a married woman. She was not pleased but accepted it and told everyone i had eloped xD", "Thank you. My mom is really something else\u2026", "Honestly, we wanted to elope in the first place. It was just both of our families trying to convince us to have a celebration in the first place, even if it was small. Once we knew that our boundaries weren\u2019t going to be respected (with my moms family) we just decided to have the elopement, like we originally planned. \n\nI think it\u2019s for the best and most people who I know that eloped have strong, healthy marriages. Also congratulations on 25 years of marriage! That\u2019s amazing :D", "Thank you! My father thinks they had it out for him because he didn\u2019t like what was going on so they always painted him as a bad guy.

For right now, we\u2019re stuck in the state and are looking for a apartment to rent out temporarily. But it\u2019s better than being stuck in a toxic environment.", "There\u2019s no point in arguing with her at this point because she believes in her head that she did everything she could, but in reality she didn\u2019t. She tried to keep the peace with her family and she failed me", "Good for you!  I\u2019m in the same family I think.  I think I\u2019m the only one is 3 generations who understands boundaries.  Good luck to you!", "It's not normal, but unfortunately it's very common. My family is like that too and it took far too long for me to realize and reduce contact.", "Yes!  Awesome!\n\nIn our case, almost everyone was delighted instantly, and even both mothers eventually got over it, in just a few years.", "Aww this is so cute! Congratulations to you both :D", "oh. that sucks. I'm sorry.", "I think the reason why I stayed in the circle for so long is that my mom conditioned me to. My dad said I had bad social skills growing up because she did not let me hang out with my friends for the most part and brought me around my cousins (this included my bully cousin) instead", "Same! We just celebrated 2 years and his mom and i are close", "It\u2019s okay! I\u2019m just trying to keep everything under wraps for now. I don\u2019t want my mom finding out I know about everything", "I don't blame you. good luck with everything and I wish you nothing but the best with the next chapter in your life.", "Thank you, you too!", "Good luck!", "No offense, but your mother and her side of the family sucks. She failed you and enabled that bullying. \n\nI wish you a wonderful life away from them!", "OP- good for you. Hope you and your fianc\u00e9 have a beautiful life together", "This all sounds great! I do want to encourage you (if you don't think it'll be too much drama, if you do then totally feel free to disregard) to have some sort of celebration (whatever would make you happy) with those you do want to be there. I just feel sad that you feel like you can't include those you do want to be there because of this. But either way, have a happy elopement!", "Good job you!! And way to go dad for telling you the while truth.", "I think you're absolutely doing the right thing.", "Absouletly right!", " I wish you all the best!", "Yep! 1st marriage was the big church wedding. It was kind of a fun day, but the planning and little dramas(I am youngest of 7 and he is youngest of 10), not so much. It didn't last. 2nd marriage...my husband jokingly asked for a date he could remember, I said no problem...I picked April 1st\ud83d\ude42, it was a Thursday. We had the mayor of a tiny nearby town marry us(he was all excited because he had never been asked to perform a marriage) with only my sister and his parents with us. It was so much fun!!! So relaxed and informal, then we went for dinner and were able to really enjoy the day. That was 24 years ago and we are still enjoying our life together.

I always wanted to go to St Lucia :)", "I avoid my mother and her whole side of the family for lots of similar reasons. It has been much better for my mental health.

It was a relatively(no pun intended) fun day for us, but the planning and the dramas (I am youngest of 7 and he is youngest of 10)were stressful.

Rather than spend money to throw a party and be stressed, you just remove yourself from a stressful situation and put the money where it matters - towards a new home for you and your fiance. It's a smart step to take. \n\nI came from a family like yours and I moved away from my mom and her family so I could grow into my own person. My mother will always choose her parents and her siblings over me and my brother and she will never change. Your mother will never change, either, so it's best to leave her to her own choices so you can start afresh with you and your fiance. Good luck and how awesome to hear you got some needed information from your dad. Sounds like the conversation you had with him opened up a new level of closeness with him!", "Can't the dad have the conversation before ?", "Someone said recently that if you had a shitty or abusive parent, the best punishment is to never let them meet their grandchildren. That's when she'll suddenly start caring about you and your child, but she doesn't get to be a part of that.", "Well just spend the money u gonna spend on wedding to honeymoon create memories with ur husband stress free", "After a bad I guess family resentment. Still friends though.  But showing that, I dunno, slight resentment at anyone I dated and talking shit to my partner I have since like avoided bringing my girlfriend around my half sister.i think that justifies why she didn't get invited but due to biological reasons her sister did.", "OP my husband and I got married on a small hidden cove in Bermuda with just an officiant and a photographer and it was honestly perfect.\n\nIt was strictly just about my husband and I which made it so much more intimate and special. We have beautiful photos of the event. \n\nI do not think you will regret your elopement at all.", "Wait, your mother knew that your cousin was mentally and physically bullying you, and her reaction to that was to\u2026keep you isolated with her? That is so messed up. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re now with a supportive partner and getting away from that incredibly toxic situation. Healing can be a difficult process, but I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re on it.", "That's literally cult shit. isolating you from society to keep you controlled."]}
