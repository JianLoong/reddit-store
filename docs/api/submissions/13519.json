I just want to come back on here to give you guys an update! First and foremost before I go to the update, I just want to thank you all for your helpful advice. it really helped me and my fianc\u00e9 get a clearer perspective on what to do. Now for the update!\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I decided to just have a basic elopement. No celebration, no after dinner, nothing. We might go on a honeymoon afterwards. We aren\u2019t sure where to go, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fun with no drama! We also decided to postpone the date of our elopement for a later date. \n\nAs of the conversation with my mother: A couple days after I posted the original Reddit post, I talked to my mother. I told her I am not having my cousin at my wedding or any future important events of mine. I don\u2019t care that she will be upset, it\u2019s my day and I say who goes and who doesn\u2019t. After I told her, she just sat there in silence. When I mentioned everything my cousin did to me in the past and told her that she did nothing about it, she got defensive. She said she tried everything that she could but I really don\u2019t believe that.\n\nA couple days ago I went on a hike with my father (parents are divorced) and I told him the situation briefly. He decided to give me the full rundown about my mother\u2019s family. Which was a very long conversation. He did not hold back. To no surprise, my father said throughout the marriage with my mother, she always chose her siblings and her mother over my father and her children. There was no boundaries on my mothers side. Everyone was in everyone\u2019s business. He told me about the bullying I received from my cousin from his perspective. For a long story short, my cousin was a horrible child. \n\nHe told me it\u2019s not worth arguing with my mother about these things because she is delusional and she will always take the side of her siblings instead of her children.\n\nI\u2019m going to keep my distance from my family and keep working hard to save my money so I can move out for my mothers house. I understand now that I cannot be around my mother\u2019s side of the family at all. It would be a very unhealthy environment for my future children and husband. I don\u2019t want to make the same mistakes my mother made. I want to be the best role model my family could have. \n\nI will update more if there is anything else to update. I just wanted to thank you guys again for giving me the best advice to follow and keeping up with my story.

No one needs this kind of toxicity in their life.  You have to make your choices just as your mom made hers.  You are going to be off to a much better start in your married life removing those who don't really care about you from your personal universe.  I hope you have a lovely wedding and a nice honeymoon!", "Good for you and good on your dad. After my mother passed, my dad filled me in on allllllllllll the family dirt. It really explained a lot of things that happened. It\u2019s a shame that things like this have to be kept under wraps to \u201ckeep up appearances\u201d.", "I'm glad you father was able to help you get clarity.", "Yay team elopement!  (We eloped back in 1995, and haven't regretted it even slightly since.)", "First and foremost, I'm really sorry for\neverything you've had to go through and the stuff you've found out. It can't have been easy. Clearly your mum has a lot of issues that she probably doesn't even realise. While that's really sad, good on you for realising the impact it has had on you and your dad, and the impact it could potentially have on your husband and kids in the future. \n\nI think you're absolutely doing the right thing. And I hope that you manage to move out of your mum's place ASAP so that you can start your new life with your husband. I wish you all the best!", "Elope.  Save your money", "Good for you. You and SO go somewhere neat like Hawaii and get married and have a romantic honeymoon.", "Blessings on your elopement. Do whatever makes you happy. So glad that you have more clarity on the big picture. Take care of yourselves.", "Congratulations!  We are also firmly on the \"tiny wedding team\" and I wouldn't change anything we did, even after over 25 years together.\n\n  \nToo often, people forget - it's about getting married, not about having a wedding. \n\nGood for you for having figured out your priorities and knowing what is important for you. Happy wishes for you both!", "I didn\u2019t elope but husband and I just had his parents and my mom at our wedding. It was what we wanted. His brother and my younger sister gave us some half-hearted shit about it for a time, but when they say \u201cwe weren\u2019t invited to their wedding\u201d we just agree and say no one was but the parents.\n\nWe had a big party months later and everyone got invited to that. (Married in Feb, party in June)", "So much money saved for the honeymoon and life together afterwards and the option to just have a couple of loved ones who matter as witnesses. Yay!\ud83d\ude0a"]}
