They offered me to play with them, and considering it was with my brother, I decided sure why not?\n\nUnfortunately, my brother seemed to have gotten a bit of a bully problem, and she (let's call her Julia, and she's a year younger than me and 2 years older than Matt) then came along and grabbed his beyblade. He begged her to give it back, and she made fun of him for liking a \"kids game\". \n\nI got really mad at her, and noticed she was wearing a necklace, so I ran to her and yanked it off her. She yelled at me to give it back, then I told her that if she gives back Matt's bey, I'll give back her necklace. She started getting upset and actually started crying a little, telling me that her mother actually willed it to her after she passed, and then I said \"If it's that meaningful to you, then you really need it back hmm? Give Matt back her beyblade and you will get it back.\"\n\nShe tossed back Matt's beyblade, and took her necklace back before running off crying. When we got home, Matt told our mother of it, and she actually got kinda mad at me, saying I should never have held a dead person's memory hostage. I told her that Julia never should have stolen his beyblade.\n\nWas I right here or AITA and I went too far?", "created_utc": 1668102775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrmm2b/aita_for_taking_my_brothers_bullys_necklace_until/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't start crap if you don't want crap done to you.  It doesn't matter if this was a momento from her deceased mother (if that's even true.

But you hope she considers going forward, that the way she feels when something precious was stolen from her, that's how anyone feels when their stuff is stolen.  It's how your brother felt when his beyblade was taken.  Nobody wants to feel like that, so it's not good to make people feel like that.  \nThen like ask if she understands what you're saying, and give her a hug or shake her hand or something.  \n\nBasically the goal here is to show her other people are good, and it always feels bad to be fucked with.", "NTA, damn good big brother move.

You never know what or why something is valued - so don't touch or take other people's property. End of story. \n\nI will caution you on using force to take things off someone when you are 18.

You did the right thing and I hope you continue to defend your brother and that this bully knocks it off!", "NTA. \n\nYou are an awesome brother though. You gave her a lesson in \u201cfuck around and find out\u201d.

Think what'd happen if her family decided to make a big deal of it, and the school and the police decided it'd be fun to make you life as bad as possible!\n\nYou exposed yourself to a bunch of danger.

You practically assaulted that girl. She should report you to the school and Matt should report her.  \nOP, did you say anything before grabbing the necklace. I can't see an indication in the post that you attempted to use your words before assaulting her. Your brother did.  \nFinally, if you were close enough to get her necklace why didn't you reach for your brothers toy instead?", "Esh. You can't just rip necklaces off without breaking them and hurting the wearer. You, and adult, assaulted the girl, a minor, and damaged her property. Did she need to be taught a lesson about bullying? Of course. Is there a better way where you actually get to keep the moral high ground?

If she stole it off the ground/whatever surface they were playing on, it's just theft/harassment. \n\nOP is not the AH but he should try to be careful.

When my son responded in kind to a bully, he would up being accused himself, and thankfully 4 teachers testified on his behalf even if the administration wasn't behaving properly.
