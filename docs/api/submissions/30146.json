This house was basically my dad\u2019s whole life goal and cost us greatly, it means a lot to my family. \n\nAnyway, we were recently fortunate enough to add another room to this house, some of my family members live there to take care of it, and whenever we go to visit we usually have to sleep on air mattresses or the couch. We have only used this new room once, however, my dad hasn't even seen it in person due to some traveling issues.\n\nMy uncle and his wife are planning to go on a trip there to see some family, his family had begged him for years to buy a house there. He blatantly refused, not because he couldn\u2019t afford it, he\u2019s just really, extremely, cheap. (This is also not in the US so houses are not expensive compared to the states). I also think he had never bought a house there because he never felt the need for it, I think he has always relied on my father's house instead of doing something himself. \n\nWe get the news that he and his wife will be taking a vacation, for a few weeks, not days. And guess where he plans to stay, my house. I feel like this is just very convenient timing, a new room means more space I feel like they might be taking advantage of it. And like I said, my father hasn\u2019t even stepped into this new room. \n\nSo instead of him and his wife staying in my new room, a couple of family members currently in my house will be staying in my new spacious room and I will be putting my uncle and his wife in a regular one. My family members who live in my house have helped me tremendously to keep my house intact and beautiful, I owe them a lot. I don't like the idea of my uncle feeling entitled to stay in my house in my new room just because he\u2019s my uncle when he has not helped me a bit with anything. \n\nSo AMITA for not allowing my uncle and his wife to stay in my new room and putting them in my old one?

He also has a personality that come of as very defensive and entitled, he didn't even ask me to stay in my house, he just said he will be staying there.
