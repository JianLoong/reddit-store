The game has four players, and you would have included her if one dropped out. \n\nDespite going out together, she left you to see some friends at the party. You left and did your own thing, while she did hers. Nothing wrong there. She just sounds jealous.", "NTA \n\nIt seems like you genuinely didn't try to exclude her and it's not like you turned her away completely. I think this situation could be sorted out with a simple conversation\n\nAlso, your cousin does have a weird energy towards you. Talking about how you look, giving an unnecessary comment. That's very odd. If you're deciding to talk to her, I suggest bringing that up too because that's a very weird thing to say", "NTA\n\nSHE sounds like a pick me. It seems like she's insecure and acting like an entitled prick.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, she up and left *without saying anything to you* (unless that was left out), so you occupying your own time elsewhere is completely justified. The comments she made are like totally mean for what? I don't understand the need to come for you. \n\nDon't even want to presume, but she sounds bitter.", "NTA at all! I don\u2019t know what she really upset about because it\u2019s not the game, it\u2019s something else.", "Do you think you excluded your cousin by starting up a 4 person game while she was otherwise engaged or you think you excluded her because she accused you or excluding her?", "NTA. Maybe she didn\u2019t think of you as a sister as you did. Which is ok. Sometimes being apart from someone makes you realise things about your yourself and your relationships. From what you wrote, it doesn\u2019t seem like you did anything wrong. Just play it by ear, maybe she was having a bad day.", "NTA - What game were you playing? She really couldn\u2019t wait till next round? There gotta be more to this story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
