I am blessed to have a husband who makes a great living, but I enjoy making a bit of my money and working at the family business. There are a few guys who work in the back doing miscellaneous jobs like fixing tools, putting together larger pieces for customers, etc. \n\nLast year, one of those guys, Luis, started kind of inappropriately flirting with me. He was texting me all hours of the night, sending selfies in bed, sending super suggestive texts, etc. I\u2019m a bad people pleaser (which I\u2019m now in therapy twice a month for) so I didn\u2019t really reciprocate but tried to be nice and laugh it off. He started flirting with me at work, bringing me food, and telling me I looked beautiful, but nothing that was WAY over the line just really uncomfortable). Both he and I are married and he has two children with his wife. No matter how often I asked about his wife he would literally flirt with me in the next sentence.\n\nI mentioned this in conversation to my dad and he got really uncomfortable (I didn\u2019t like sit him down for a talk or anything). In the past he has always brushed stuff like this off and I get the feeling that he\u2019s annoyed at me (and everyone involved) that it\u2019s happening and just doesn\u2019t want to deal with it. He just mumbled something then changed the subject and the vibe was that I need to not mention it again. His reaction made me feel kind of shitty so I handled it myself by kind of shutting him down - hard for me but it eventually worked. I\u2019m very careful not to give him even a hint of attention now.\n\nNow, a woman customer came in and ripped into my dad because Luis did the same thing to her when she wasn\u2019t reciprocating. She said it\u2019s inappropriate and is harassment and he needs to stop texting her. When my dad told me that, I kind of laughed and said it was going to happen eventually, and why didn\u2019t he deal with it when Luis did it to me? Both my dad and mom got upset with me and told me I need to be supporting the business and were angry that I laughed at it. We kind of got in a fight and I told them they care more about the business than protecting their daughter, while they said they know Luis is just an in appropriate flirt but is not dangerous. We are currently not speaking and my husband is pretty upset with them at this point (I asked him to let me handle it beforehand).

Why would they want ANY inappropriate behaviors to happen in their business? \n\nAre inappropriate inventory methods allowed? \nInappropriate safety standards? \nWhat about inappropriate payment methods.

Shocked Pikachu face moments are always funny.\n\nLuis stole the customer\u2019s information from the store so he could methodically harass her. That is dangerous behavior. That\u2019s an INSANE line to cross. Customer information is NEVER to be used for anything but business purposes, and NEVER shared without a subpoena from the government or waiver from the customer.\n\nThey need to fire him. Immediately. Maybe even press charges.\n\nI don\u2019t understand what they expect you to do. What do they mean by \u201csupport the business\u201d?", "NTA, but your father sure is one, in a major way. He should have handled/fired Luis immediately when he found out about Luis' highly inappropriate behavior.

You were right to laugh at him.", "NTA\n\nYour father didn't want to deal with an uncomfortable situation that his *own daughter* was going through - So he shouldn't be surprised that it escalated to someone else.", ">Does your dad want a lawsuit, cause this is how you get a lawsuit\n\nLawsuit and loss of business when word gets out.

I think even with the customer my parents will brush it under the rug - apologize to her but not do anything. It feels so unethical to me but everyone here is making me realize it\u2019s a serious legal problem too", "*\"Your dad is setting himself up for a lawsuit.\"*\n\nExactly. Op's dad is gonna have his shocked Pikachu moment when he realizes an inappropriate flirt *is* dangerous, especially to a company.", "He seems to think that because Luis is not really physical at all, just inappropriately flirty, that there\u2019s no issue. Which is wild to me because its just not true", "Good point. They wouldn\u2019t allow any of those things. They\u2019re very strict with safety measures and will easily correct any employee on that. But somehow they can\u2019t quite do it for these things. I think they actually don\u2019t have the emotional capacity to deal with it and understand that it\u2019s really bad if he\u2019s doing that to a customer. But yeah while I wasn\u2019t in any danger (there are always multiple employees present who I\u2019ve known since I was born, Luis is younger) I definitely am very hurt and I think that\u2019s where my laughter came from", "That might've been good enough the first time, but now he's got a customer complaining about harassment. Luis needs to be gone.", "He\u2019s sexually harassed a customer and the owner\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s beyond belief he\u2019s still working there .", "Yeah I\u2019m definitely seeing my parents in a new light. This all just went down this week so I\u2019m still processing but I agree about future kids. It\u2019s just insane to me how they wouldn\u2019t want to protect their kids? Even from minor things. Even if they advised me on how to deal with it myself I would feel much better than all the rug sweeping and \u201cdon\u2019t talk about that\u201d vibes", "I did think about sending her screenshots, but I feel weird because 1) I\u2019ve never met her and 2) I really think she must know. I don\u2019t know, I just can\u2019t imagine him being that obvious and her not eventually finding out since he does it to a lot of people. The other issue is that it would blow up everything at work for me and I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to work there anymore because it would be so uncomfortable. If he left or I left then I definitely would do that", "And like, the fact that he\u2019s harassing women who are saying no and are clearly showing that they want him to stop doesn\u2019t make me think very highly of him and definitely doesn\u2019t make me think he\u2019s harmless.", "I mean it\u2019s kinda shitty to place the onus on the person being harassed rather than the one doing the harassment.", "I get what you\u2019re saying. I definitely should have done a better job shutting it down. I\u2019m working on it now and do have a lot more personal power so hopefully I wouldn\u2019t let something like that happen again", "Even if he was right, he's still wrong. It's bad when it's another employee. It's worse when that employee is also your daughter, but somehow it's still even worse when it's a random customer. This could destroy his business. Luis needs to be unemployed...immediately. I seriously doubt this is the first customer that he's done this with, this is just the first one who was vocal about it. Luis is going to destroy his business if he doesn't do something.", "Then ask your dad if that means he also would force his attentions on women.

But why is he still working there?! And why are you willing to still work there if he is there?! Your dad knows he\u2019s harassing his daughter and is liability with customers! He is failing to protect you and to protect his clientele. I would refuse to work there until he does something (honestly I would cut contact with my dad all together if he did that). It\u2019s not a safe place for you or any woman.", "It's not harassment though is it, she hadnt communicated with him. He thought she liked the attention. Now she has communicated to him he has stopped.", "It's not harassment though is it, she hadnt communicated with him. He thought she liked the attention. Now she has communicated to him he has stopped.", "That's good.\nIf the guy keeps going after you've made it clear it is not wanted then I would expect your dad to take action and sack him then.", "Op mentions being married and I would assume that not flirting with a married woman is common sense, but after op finally did put her foot down, he immediately went and did the same thing to a female customer. \n\nThe fact he\u2019s married makes his behavioral issues even worse.", "There both married, what kind of person would think that that's wanted attention? And on top of that he's doing it to other people.", "He's not going to, he's useless.", "As soon as op made it clear, he stopped. Therefore it is not harassment, simple.\nIf he was texting the female customer, one would assume it's because she gave him her number.", "Plenty of people have affairs unfortunately, and if she didn't shut it down, then he may assume she's like him"]}
