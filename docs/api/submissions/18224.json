I am blessed to have a husband who makes a great living, but I enjoy making a bit of my money and working at the family business. There are a few guys who work in the back doing miscellaneous jobs like fixing tools, putting together larger pieces for customers, etc. \n\nLast year, one of those guys, Luis, started kind of inappropriately flirting with me. He was texting me all hours of the night, sending selfies in bed, sending super suggestive texts, etc. I\u2019m a bad people pleaser (which I\u2019m now in therapy twice a month for) so I didn\u2019t really reciprocate but tried to be nice and laugh it off. He started flirting with me at work, bringing me food, and telling me I looked beautiful, but nothing that was WAY over the line just really uncomfortable). Both he and I are married and he has two children with his wife. No matter how often I asked about his wife he would literally flirt with me in the next sentence.\n\nI mentioned this in conversation to my dad and he got really uncomfortable (I didn\u2019t like sit him down for a talk or anything). In the past he has always brushed stuff like this off and I get the feeling that he\u2019s annoyed at me (and everyone involved) that it\u2019s happening and just doesn\u2019t want to deal with it. He just mumbled something then changed the subject and the vibe was that I need to not mention it again. His reaction made me feel kind of shitty so I handled it myself by kind of shutting him down - hard for me but it eventually worked. I\u2019m very careful not to give him even a hint of attention now.\n\nNow, a woman customer came in and ripped into my dad because Luis did the same thing to her when she wasn\u2019t reciprocating. She said it\u2019s inappropriate and is harassment and he needs to stop texting her. When my dad told me that, I kind of laughed and said it was going to happen eventually, and why didn\u2019t he deal with it when Luis did it to me? Both my dad and mom got upset with me and told me I need to be supporting the business and were angry that I laughed at it. We kind of got in a fight and I told them they care more about the business than protecting their daughter, while they said they know Luis is just an in appropriate flirt but is not dangerous. We are currently not speaking and my husband is pretty upset with them at this point (I asked him to let me handle it beforehand).

Ask him why does he want to risk his business on some fool because eventually Luis is going to harass the wrong person and shit will hit the fan.  BTW unwanted inappropriately behavior is sexual harassment and is still illegal....tell him that.  Key word is ***unwanted***!!!\n\nYou tell him you ARE supporting the business.  You are trying to protect it and if he wants to keep his business he should too.  \n\n[https://www.eeoc.gov/sexual-harassment](https://www.eeoc.gov/sexual-harassment)\n\n[https://www.score.org/resource/blog-post/what-every-small-business-owner-needs-know-about-sexual-harassment](https://www.score.org/resource/blog-post/what-every-small-business-owner-needs-know-about-sexual-harassment)", "INFO: How did Luis get the customer's #? If it was through the business, would your dad not fire him just for that?", "what will your father do when the husband or father of luis next victim shows up? maybe with a bat or tire iron or a couple of friends names Smith & Wesson? and word gets out there was a pattern of behavior and the business owner did nothing?", "I think it\u2019s important to consider that if Luis has this massive lack of boundaries, that he may seek you out when there is no-one around. Like, what if he waited for you by your car at the end of the day, or followed you after work?  \nMTA but be very careful not to be alone with this guy. (The customer also has every right to be very angry and probably quite afraid too.)", "OP, maybe have your parents (especially your dad) watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTvSfeCRxe8). Jackson Katz does an amazing job explaining the how and why men who stand idly by on issues concerning women\u2019s safety are just as complicit as those who commit inappropriate acts.", "He knows his buddies are are shielding him. I can guess that's why he's so bold but I can only guess.", "Honestly, if I found out that my friendly family owned business was dismissing sexual harassment complaints because they were made by members of the family it would 100% put me off of going there. People usually pay slightly more to support local businesses instead of going to big-box stores ... but at least Home Depot has an HR department that won't victim-blame over family dinner.", "Not reciprocating and mentioning that they\u2019re both in relationships is all the communication you need. But you\u2019re probably one of those \u201cunless she\u2019s screaming no she\u2019s just playing hard to get haha\u201d types which is worrying", "exactly."]}
