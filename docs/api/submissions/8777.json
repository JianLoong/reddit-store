I agreed to and she sent them.\n\nIt was fine for a first draft. It had a few mistakes here and there, and some parts where the story lulled a bit, but those can all be fixed. The main issue I had with it was that every character in the book is a vegan.\n\nIt\u2019s not explicitly stated in the text, but it\u2019s heavily implied. At one point in the story the character is ordering food and there\u2019s only vegan options, another adds oat \u201cmilk\u201d to his coffee, and earlier on someone has scrambled tofu for breakfast.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s a small part of what she\u2019s written and she doesn\u2019t linger on the food too much, so it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s the focal point of the story, but it\u2019s noticeable.\n\nWhen I gave her the feedback I ended it with mentioning how it was unrealistic for everyone in the book to be vegans. She said okay and thanked me for the feedback and that was the end of it.\n\nI talked to her the day before yesterday and asked her, out of curiosity, which characters she was planning on changing from a vegan to a meat eater. She said none.\n\nWhen I asked her why and she said that she didn\u2019t want to write people who ate meat. And when I pressed she kept dancing around the question until I told her that she asked for feedback, so why would she ask and not take my advice?\n\nShe told me that she appreciated my feedback and she took some of it, she claims to have made some revisions and cut some scenes, but her characters being vegan was something she wasn\u2019t going to change. That she didn\u2019t agree with it morally and she wasn\u2019t going to write is as the norm, much less have her protagonists eat it.\n\nAfter she said that I reminded her that not everyone in the real word was vegan, and making all of her characters be vegans was going to alienate potential readers and make them uncomfortable. At this point she started getting defensive and asked if them being vegan made me uncomfortable, I told her they didn\u2019t but it did break the immersion for me because of how unrealistic it was. Then she made a snide comment about how I write fantasy, despite the fact that that\u2019s a completely different situation.\n\nAt this point I started being a little harsh. I told her that if she was going to be so stubborn she\u2019d never get her books published, because publishers won\u2019t take a chance on her when she\u2019s filling her books with nothing but wish fulfillment.\n\nWe went back and forth for a bit until she ended the conversation with a rant about how meat eating writers rarely, if ever, take vegan\u2019s into consideration when writing characters, so why should she, and hasn\u2019t responded since.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1675182369, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10q3clc/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_she_shouldnt_make_all/", "score": 677, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tofu is a common food, especially in certain cultures. Even for omnivores. People can have milk allergies and use oat milk. Vegan restaurants exist.\n\nAlienates potential readers? It\u2019s not that deep. And what about vegans? Do they just have to read about Omnivores and feel alienated?\n\nBut fantasy works?\n\nAlso - many books get published that are just flat out *wrong*.

She's doing just that. It was fine that you included the supposed vegan issue in your critique,  it's not okay that you assumed she was required to follow your advice and then argue with her about refusing to listen to you. YTA", "YTA for hounding her about this.\n\nSo what if not everyone in the world is a vegan? I've read books with mostly vampires as characters and yet, I'm pretty sure there are no vampires in the world. \n\nThe important thing is to encourage her to keep writing, which is the opposite of what you're doing.", "YTA I read books that are based in the 2050s and 60s. EVERYTHING is soy based because of how expensive meat is. The only people who eat real meat are the people who can afford to. \n\nThe thing about books is that they can be about LITERALLY ANYTHING. you don't like that all the characters are vegan, then don't read the book. \n\nIt's called having an imagination.", "YTA shes 17 and writes about what she knows. Also, the fact that its not explicitly written, but youre not in doubt that the character is vegan is just an example of what good writing is.", "Steven King doesn't morally agree with murderers killing people, but he still writes about them.\n\nN T A for giving advice, but back off now.  YTA for how you keep pushing this.\n\n\" I told her that she asked for feedback, so why would she ask and not take my advice?\"\n\nYou don't understand what advice and feedback means.  A person is allowed to ignore advice  if they don't agree with it.  Even if they're the ones that are wrong.  Advice is not an order.   Back off.", "YTA for pushing it. The initial critique was very fair as that is part of the writing process. But once she said she changed none you should've let it go. People aren't always going to use every piece of feedback. You overreacted.", "YTA. She doesn't have to take your advice; get over it. \n\nYou don't know how publishers will respond to her work. Don't push her to change something just because you think everyone will think the same as you do.", "YTA. You have not described an excessive number of vegan meals for characters to eat in a book. That's not going to make or break her writing career. But the quality of the feedback isn't really why you're TA, it's that you kept pushing it. You gave her (slightly silly) feedback, she politely accepted it, you brought it up again and then got huffy and condescending when she didn't agree with you. This one's definitely on you.", "YTA, she asked for feedback, and you gave her feedback, then a lecture when she didn't take every bit of advice you gave. Feedback is asking for perspective, not for you to \"fix\" her writing.", "Yta who cares what they eat. Non vegans can eat scrambles tofu aswell.\n\nAlso genuine question, but why does it offend you that a character or even multiple are vegan? Is she otherwise preaching about it? Saying meat eaters are less then vegans? Or are they just eating however they want and letting others be? I just don't understand. Not a vegan myself btw", "Mentioning it once is fine harping on abt it n saying she's gunna fail makes YTA", "Its funny, vegans have a rep for asking their eating habits to be a central theme in everything, but if she's presenting her characters as people doing people things, who happen to be vegan (or even just avoiding dairy),it sounds fine.  YTA for calling her out, and being the one judging the non existent lifestyle issue of fictional beings.", "YTA. It\u2019s a BOOK. Its a fiction book. It\u2019s inherently not going to be 100% realistic because it\u2019s all fake. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s the main plot point of her story and idk why it bothers you that the characters have oat milk and scrambled tofu, but being so overly critical about it is comical", "As a meat eater, Yta\n\nI don't need to see myself in every book I read, I actually think that the recent need to turn every character into self inserts is killing a lot of genres. I've never stopped reading a book because people ate foods I didn't like, and I could never see myself in a world where no one ate the food I wanted, because that would be an incredibly shallow thing to judge a book on.", "YTA if your immersion is broken by vegans existing in a book and interacting with each other I shudder to think how you'd react to a book where all the characters aren't white, or are all lawyers, or are all struggling with ADHD, not drinkers, or anything that may not apply to you.", "YTA\n\nIt's her story. She took your feedback and did what she wanted with it.\n\nIt doesn't matter if all her characters are vegan. It's her story. Her world. Her characters, her plot her IP.\n\nYou didn't mention that you're a published author... so do you really think you have any credibility on telling someone what will or won't get their boom published?", "YTA - Just because you gave her advice doesn't mean she has to take it. It is her book and she can write however she wants.", "Yta let her characters be vegan! It\u2019s her world that she is building! Stop pushing meat just because it\u2019s fits your norm!", "Yta - feedback and curiousity are fine. Pushing someone to write what they don't want to - not okay. In the real world, people cheat. I don't write about cheaters. It was 3 meals in the course of an entire book. Apologize and let it go.", "YTA.  If you ask someone for feedback and they give it to you, it doesn't obligate you to take it.  Why would you assume that she would change her characters' diets because you don't like that they're all vegan?\n\nAlso, I would not be alienated if all of her characters are vegan when I am not.  I also wouldn't assume that publishers would shy away from her.\n\nThe question here is are you anti-vegan or are you jealous?", "YTA, your cousin was being quite nice saying how she appreciated your feedback, you shouldn't have hounded her to change something so peculiar.\n\n>At this point she started getting defensive and asked if them being vegan made me uncomfortable, I told her they didn\u2019t but it did break the immersion for me because of how unrealistic it was.\n\nWhy do you care so much about the characters being vegan?? it really has no impact on the whole thing, you said it yourself it's only mentioned here and there\n\n>Then she made a snide comment about how I write fantasy, despite the fact that that\u2019s a completely different situation.\n\nNo, it's not. If you can write a book about dragons/warlocks/... then she can write a book about vegan characters. It's that simple.\n\nThe moment she told you she wasn't going to use your feedback, you should've just said \"alright\" and kept the rest to yourself.", "YTALook at it from this perspective: White people have been writing books populated exclusively by other white people for centuries, in spite of the real world being far more diverse. And they've been published and made money for their authors.\n\nJust because she asked for your advice doesn't mean she has to take it. Her book, her choices. A publisher may tell her that she must make changes before her book can be published, but unless you're that person, apologize for being harsh and let it go.", "YTA, it's her book, if she wants to write about a world where everyone is vegan, good on her, let her build that world. I think it's much more creative than just writing about the shit world we all see everyday", "yes, YTA. Telling her once was good. Telling her twice was enough already. Telling her repeatedly and getting harsh with her is completely out of line.", "YTA\n\nJust because something isn\u2019t or hasn\u2019t been done doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t. I, a happy meat eater, wouldn\u2019t have a problem being immersed in a story without meat eaters. I\u2019d be far more interested in the substantive content of the story/plot. And even if there were scenes that revolves around vegan diet it\u2019s not inherently bad just because *you* don\u2019t care for it.\n\nBooks are gateways to new types of thinking for a lot of people. YA novels often focus on what makes a character different from the crowd and that can be positive and a driving force behind the success of the book. Maybe vegan kids and adults will appreciate being represented the same way PoC or LGBTQ, etc are when they read characters that look/act like them.", "YTA. Just because you offer feedback doesn't mean anyone is obligated to take it. Your words are not manna from Heaven. Your anti-vegan feelings are your problem, not hers. At 17 she may not even be considering wide publication. Even if she was, most of us as readers wouldn't reject a book for vegan characters.", "OP, YTA. It\u2019s her novel, if she wants all of her characters to be vegans, that\u2019s her choice. Regardless if it doesn\u2019t happen that way in real life, you\u2019re her family and she trusts you enough to provide feedback, so instead of putting her down, boost her up.  Who knows, maybe this story might be the next big thing amongst young vegans, who can relate to the character, and like you said it\u2019s such a small aspect of the novel. (And this is coming from a guy that owned a bbq restaurant)", "YTA - Her book her choice.  She could could market the novel to vegans only. [P.S](https://P.Si) i eat meat myself but i get   that to each person there own choice.", "YTA. Just because someone asks for your feedback doesn't mean they have to take it. If she wants her character to eat tofu scrambles, then let her do it. You said your piece once; you didn't need to keep harping on it.", "YTA, also a book featuring an explicitly vegan cast would probably set itself apart a bit and might be helpful", "YTA - I say this as a pro writer and as a writing teacher.\n\nFirst, when you offer critique, the writer is under no obligation to change their work based on your feedback. It's up to the writer to synthesize useful feedback and also to discard anything that doesn't fit into their vision.\n\nIf you go around saying to other writers \"Why ask for my feedback if you aren't going to take it\" then you will soon find yourself very lonely in the writing world. That's rude as heck.\n\nSecond, it's not a big deal for characters to be vegan. Hell, I put oat milk in my coffee and I'm not one. You said it didn't make you uncomfortable, but clearly it did and you need to own that. Very few readers are going to be turned off by vegan characters unless the characters are obnoxious about it.\n\nYou are extrapolating your own reaction out to the wider world, another big no no when it comes to giving feedback.\n\nThird, as a fantasy writer myself, your friend made a good point. If you can put dragons or elves in your story, she can make her characters vegan. It's not that unrealistic. I live in Portland, OR and if I chose to, I could surround myself with nothing but vegan friends.\n\nIn the end, this is her book, not yours, and you should not be trying to dictate to her. Offer feedback and then step back.", "YTA. There's nothing wrong with having an entire book of vegans. As the example stands it doesn't even read all vegan. I'm vegetarian and eat tofu scrambles (I eat eggs, too). I use oat milk as do many non vegans (but I use regular milk too). There are restaurants that are only vegan and shock meat eaters go to them as well. There are entire universes created that are vegan/vegetarian in future settings and no one cares. If the mentions above make someone so uncomfortable they have some serious issues.", "YTA\n\nYes she asked for feedback, you were nice enough to read and give her your thoughts.  She thanked you for that. It sounds like she appreciated your time and feedback especially regarding the lulling/errors.  \n\nBUT just because somebody gives their opinion doesn't mean the writer needs to do everything that person says.  You've given her something to think about but ultimately it's her choice. \n\nOf course in the real world a lot of people eat meat.  But if this writer doesn't want to deal with that - it's fine. From what you've said it isn't preachy, it doesn't linger on the Vegan food, and if it's a good story I doubt this will turn people off.  Unless this is a biography or historical piece - a writer can create any world they want.  \n\nWrite what You want and let your friend write what she wants.", "I mean I get the logic, but at the end of the day it is her book. \n\nSo I'm going with a YTA.", "YTA. I don't think your feedback was necessarily wrong, but you gave it and you should have left it there. There was no reason for it to become and argument or for you to expect her to change her story based on your feedback and pushing the issue is what makes you the AH in this situation.", "YTA - She asked for your advice, not for you to write the novel for her. Then you\u2019re taken aback because she applies your advice, but not all of it. \n\nI understand you might think you \u201cknow better\u201d when it comes to writing, but ultimately it is her book and she will write it how she wants. Be appreciative that she applied any of your advice at all. That in itself is a compliment. \n\nLet the publishers and people buying the books tell her whether the vegan character approach is one that is satisfying to audiences. \n\nThe more you press your disappointment in advice not being taken, the less you might find yourself being asked for it.", "YTA; you ask why she is so stubborn but you\u2019re the one who appears most stubborn\u2026\n\n\n\nHer book; you gave advice; she doesn\u2019t have to take it", "YTA. One comment to her that you found the frequency of references to plant based food distracting would have been feedback. Hounding her about inserting meat-eating into her writing to please you is out of line.", "YTA.\n\nAn important thing to consider is that those food items aren't only for vegans.", "YTA. You gave your opinion, that's where you should have stopped. \n\nI also think you're very wrong that it would alienate most readers. A couple, sure, but I always find it interesting when a writer flips the script on what I tend to consider normal, it's not a bad thing to be forced to notice that your assumptions of normal aren't the only way things could be.", "YTA\n \nYou gave her your notes.  There is  no need to push one above the others.\n\nShe might have a market. It won\u2019t be huge if she does . It is likely that her first few will be self-published.  She has your feedback.", "YTA. You gave criticism. It was heard. Job done. Honestly, she\u2019s not wrong on two points; writing from her own experience, and writing something she endorses. I wonder, did anyone bother to critique George RR Martin because most people don\u2019t shag their brother? Idk, that high horse must have a nice view though!", "YTA -   Unless she is writing historical non-fiction involving real life people whose non-vegan diet was integral to the story, then why tf does it matter?   I can maybe understand bringing it up, but to insist on in it to the point where you're being \"harsh\" is completely unnecessary.", "YTA. the first piece of feedback was fine but she is in no way obligated to change it. people write about slightly different worlds all the time. And you do sound terribly condescending. If someone asks for your feedback that means they want to CONSIDER what a reader would think. But your perspective is not the only perspective and she decided this wasn't something she wanted to change, even if it lacks 'realism'.\n\nIf she took your advice while disagreeing with you I'd consider *that* the sign of a poor, anxious writer. Let her experiment geez", "> I told her that she asked for feedback, so why would she ask and not take my advice?\n\nI think you misunderstanding what's feedback. \nYes your opinion and they think about it, adapt the new pov and then make the change *they* think was good. \nThey don't obligated to do everything you say, you're not giving them commands. \nYou are just giving them something to think about. \n\nAnd the fact that you keep hounding her about it shows you are very weirdly emotional about it for some reason. \nYTA", "\u201c..so why would she ask and not take my advice?\u201d\n\nBecause she doesn\u2019t believe your suggestions help. It\u2019s not your book. You expect too much when you think others would change their books to suit your taste. \n\nYTA, not for suggesting character changes, but for being upset that they weren\u2019t changed.", "YTA, bro, your feedback is not law. If you were a real published author, not a hobbiest writer looking to sell whatever you can, you'd know that creative feedback is not law, and an artist's integrity to what they feel their work represents is just important. \n\nYou're not even knowledgable enough about the market to know that vegan fiction is a legit genre, and it's typically a story function in scifi and dystopian novels because meat is incredibly resource inefficent at scale.", "There are plenty of books with no meat eating characters,  and she chose a subtle and appropriate way to convey that hers was one.  Sounds like you are the militant one here.  YTA", "YTA\n\nI'm guessing you are not a professional publisher, proofreader, or editor. If so it sounds like your cousin asked your opinion, and didn't pay you for a professional one. She asked for notes. You gave her notes. She took some. She ditched others.\n\nGranted *if* she tried to get the book published and the publisher gave her the same notes, and she didn't take them then, and her book doesn't get published...*now* she really can't complain if that's a hill she wants to die on. Then she died on said hill.", "**YTA**\n\nAs an actual former literary agent, I can guarantee that despite referring to yourself as \"a writer\" (I mean, I guess so is anyone who writes words, then?) and pretentiously doling out \"advice\" to your cousin, you definitely haven't been published, and probably never will be. Which, BTW, isn't necessarily an insult. Most aspiring writers will never be traditionally published authors. There's nothing wrong with just writing because you enjoy it, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're any good at it, that you understand that it's a business, that there's an audience for what you write, or that it's meant to be your career.\n\nBut my point is: you clearly DON'T understand fiction writing from a business or marketing point of view if you think that something as utterly negligible as whether someone's characters eat vegan food is remotely important. Unless it's a major plot point, or weirdly incongruous to every other aspect of the character, no one actually CARES what a character eats. Like, at all. Most people aren't even going to notice or pay attention. The fact that you do just tells me that you're paying attention to all the wrong things. \n\nYTA because you're not only discouraging a young aspiring writer from being true to her own characters and writing what she feels (always the best course of action), but because you're doing it from up on a high horse that you haven't earned. You haven't indicated that you are a publishing professional of any sort, or that you have any justification for the nonsense you're telling her. You're just being patronising and discouraging for its own sake, which is awful. Shame on you.", "YTA\n\nDude, get over yourself. You gave feedback, it's up to her to decide what to do with it. And I doubt she'll come looking for help from you again.", "Lol", "YTA for hounding her to change it.\n\nYour points are valid, but it's her work and her choice to stick with it or change it.\n\nYour friend is gonna have to learn her own way.\n\nIs her book just a modern day fiction or something more beyond all vegan? I'm just wondering cause if it's just a modern day story her fantasy comparison kinda falls flat.\n\nBTW I do agree about the immersion being broken if she goes out of her way to describe a character pouring oat milk  if they have already been described as vegan. People tend to get too caught up in characteristics and think that is a characters character, it's a part of it but should not be it (goes for many people/characters)", "YTA - if it\u2019s not critical to the book itself, just let ir be.\n\nLet the editors, critics, readers, and sales be the commentary on this one", "YTA\n\nLet the harsh reality of the publishing world chew her up and spit her out.", "ESH\n\nJust let her be a shitty writer, man. Don't even worry about it. This preachiness is gonna seep into more and more of her writing, and she's eventually gonna hear the same thing you told her from different sources. Just ride it out.", "ESH\n\nYou: Pushed the issue too much.  You gave your feedback and while inquiring if she took any of your feedback to heart was okay, you shouldn't have had a frickin debate about it.  Let her learn the hard way. If the rest of the story is really good, I doubt this would actually scare off any readers.  And I say this as an avid meat lover.  Yeah I might find it annoying if that was a quirk of an author but I don't see it as being a total deal breaker myself.  For example, it really greatly bothers me that Judith McNaught writes so many forced intimacy scenes in her books.  But because the rest of the story is so good, I have read more than one book by her.  But I also have made that a reason to choose Amanda Quick or Julie Garwood over her when I'm picking a book so yes that annoying tendency of hers has caused me to choose another author over her when it came time to pick a book to buy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer: She's being totally unrealistic here.  I think you're right that sooner or later her readers might pick up on this quirk of hers and it may well alienate readers who might have otherwise read more stories from her but will avoid it since she's giving the appearance of being a vegan crusader which is NOT why people are trying to read her books.  Alienating people when you write isn't really a good thing.", "NTA. It\u2019s up to her to write crappy stories and books. \n\nVeganism, for some (not all), is an evangelical religion and they\u2019ll stick to it even more so than the people who believe that the earth is flat or that there\u2019s a bearded old man in the sky telling us to not be gay or kill fetuses. It\u2019s the same thing and it\u2019s based on the same amount of science, none.\n\nIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s right to eat what they want, but it\u2019s none of their right to evangelize and push their thoughts on everyone else.\n\nJust leave her be.

That she didn\u2019t agree with it morally and she wasn\u2019t going to write is as the norm, much less have her protagonists eat it.\n\nAfter she said that I reminded her that not everyone in the real word was vegan, and making all of her characters be vegans was going to alienate potential readers and make them uncomfortable. At this point she started getting defensive and asked if them being vegan made me uncomfortable, I told her they didn\u2019t but it did break the immersion for me because of how unrealistic it was. Then she made a snide comment about how I write fantasy, despite the fact that that\u2019s a completely different situation.\n\nAt this point I started being a little harsh. I told her that if she was going to be so stubborn she\u2019d never get her books published because publishers won\u2019t take a chance on her when she\u2019s filling her books with nothing but wish fulfillment.\n\nWe went back and forth for a bit until she ended the conversation with a rant about how meat eating writers rarely, if ever, take vegan\u2019s into consideration when writing characters, so why should she, and hasn\u2019t responded since.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Its not a problem that not in the world is vegan. Its a fictional world that she created and that should make her happy. As a non vegan I would not care if all characters in a book are vegans. If the book isn't about veganism/animal rights altogether I don't think she will alienate anyone by what people eat.

Maybe her books will appeal to a niche market of vegan readers.  \n\nAlso, I will add, friend groups sometimes form around shared interests and values.  If the characters in the books are all part of the same friend group, I wouldn't necessarily call it unrealistic for them to all be vegan (maybe they were drawn together because they shared those values).

It's weird that you think it is. \n\nFor example: My friends and I often ask each other for their advice. But we don't just do what the others say; we use it as extra information and data, and it helps us realise what we want.

(I'm guessing you're neither in publishing nor even an English major. Right or wrong, you don't know what you're talking about.) But more importantly, what matters most is that you're having fun and getting exercise. There are plenty of benefits that have nothing to do with getting a professional contract.\n\nYour cousin is doing something she enjoys. She's honing her skills as a writer (something that will come in useful in college and probably in whatever job she gets). If she does end up as a published author, it's very likely it will be self-published, or it will be a small run with a minor press that cares more about artistic quality than marketability.\n\nMaybe she will hit the jackpot and get a deal with a major press who cares about the number of vegans in her book. It's almost certainly not going to be with *this* book. But it will be with skills she began to develop here, and a love for writing she's going to develop now.\n\nUnless her asshole of a cousin makes the whole process so unpleasant that she stops writing.", "A soft YTA on this one - one of the first things they say for writing is \"write what you know about\" if your friend is vegan, it's natural that their characters display vegan tendencies. If it's not a overt thing with every character taking ten pages to monologue on why they chose to be vegans and the sins of the meat industry then it should be fine.\n\nI myself am not vegan but I still enjoy eating tofu from time to time, the local Chinese takeout does some delicious tofu dishes and I will treat myself to a portion of szechuan tofu pieces alongside my crispy chilli beef and egg-fried noodles. I've never liked cows milk because in my personal opinion it smells rather funky even when fresh, but a dollop of hazelnut milk makes a really interesting hot chocolate and I enjoy it. I'm sure I'm not the only person in the world who does this, and if the rest of your friend's story holds up then let them have it", "YTA.

Seriously, your response to her disagreement makes me wonder how receptive you would be to an editor's feedback yourself.", "Writer here, and YTA. It was fine to give her a note on all the characters being vegan, but her asking for your input isn't her asking you to write the story for her.

She said none.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would that be a question? You know that YTA", "YTA. Your intense concern over this minor detail is very weird.", "YTA.\n\nI get your point here-- in an otherwise realistic and set-currently story, all the characters being exclusively vegan can potentially come off as *uncanny* to the reader. If the story is meant to feel like it represents reality, it could possibly create a little bit of a feeling that something is slightly off from reality, even if the reader doesn't explicitly notice it, which might create a dissonance between what she intends to communicate and what the reader interprets. Like a Twilight Zone episode where you get a sense of wrongness from something the whole episode, and you sit there suspecting that you're going to find out the character was abducted by aliens and this is all a simulation or something. It's valid for you to share that impression the story left on you so she knows it's there, unintentionally or not.\n\n(But you haven't even shared with us whether she's writing a story set in \"reality\" or a fantasy story. This uncanny feeling would honestly probably only be an issue in stories set in more real settings. A fantasy reader is just going to think \"oh this culture is vegan\" not \"this feels slightly off\".)\n\nAnd regardless, once you've told her \"this caused me to get this impression,\" then you need to back off and let her decide what to do with that. There isn't just one way to handle it-- removing mentions of specific foods so that it's unknown whether anyone is vegan, explicitly mention that the protagonist's friend group that makes up the cast is all made up of vegans because they all met at an event with no vegan options and bonded over the fact that they all were suffering together, or the cast is all Hindu, lots of options here-- the problem isn't all the cast is vegan, it's that a happens-to-be-all-vegan cast would feel uncanny in a realistic story, but there are realistic ways to end up with a friends group that shares your values. It's her choice on how to handle it, or to not handle it. Once you've handed over your feedback draft, back off, a beta-reader isn't a co-writer.", "YTA. It looks like you are the one making the food a focal point and having issues with vegan vs meat thung. I am a meat eater, and the way you told she presented how the eating and food is portrayed in the book, i would not bat an eye if i would read that someone is having tofu for breakfast and drinking oat milk.", "YTA. You do realize technically the entirety of Star Trek (and similar shows/franchises like the Orville who use anything like replicator technology for most food production) are low key vegan? Lots of fantasy stories too? \n\nAdvice and feedback is just that. No one is obligated to take someone's note and use it. You're not even published yet either, why do you think your opinion is the end all be all? Get over yourself. \n\nAlso high five to your cousin for her clapback. She's right, others don't take her into account in their writing, so why should she take others into account in hers?", "YTA\n\nLook, I eat plenty of meat, too.  You're overstepping here and need to back off.\n\nIn the world she's creating, people are vegan.  Just because she trusted you to ask for your input on her work, that doesn't mean she has to take it as a command from on high and onboard every word of it.  And she *did* take some of it on board!\n\nShe responded very politely to your input.  She did not lecture you about meat eating.  She only brought up meat eaters in response to you being, frankly, rude to her.  And even then it was just to point out how often in the mainstream, the vegan perspective isn't considered.  You probably *wouldn't* notice if a work (similarly \"unrealistically\") featured no vegans, and every meal description included meat.  She also, once pressed, mentioned her personal moral and ethical stand on the matter, but without attacking you.\n\nIn the world she's creating, people are vegan, so that's part of her vision and will not be changing.  You don't get to dictate this.  Heck, you aren't even her editor.\n\nThis is how fiction works.  It's her work, her world.  It's not going to align perfectly with the real world.  It will align to a degree, in ways both intended and not, with her values.  \n\nOf *course* it's wish fulfillment to some degree.\n\nAnd though I like to eat meat, I cannot *fathom* being offended by reading a work in which the characters or society presented happened to be vegan, even a world which differed from the real world in basically only that way.  Wouldn't alienate or make me uncomfortable.  Why does it offend you so much?", "YTA. she asked you for some feedback, not to be hounded and harassed about something no one else will care about.", "YTA\nShe accepted your feedback without attitude.\nShe is under no obligation to agree or to change her story based on your advice.\nYour overstepping.", "YTA- in Star Trek the earth is mainly vegan, and Star Fleet ships only have vegan food from the replicators.

BUT that\u2019s always the writer\u2019s choice.\n\nI\u2019m childfree and the characters in my novels are childfree (unless they need to be parents for the plot). Is it realistic to have that many childfree characters? Not really, but I do it because that\u2019s what I know. Being a mother is not part of my background and experience, so it would be a challenge to write an MC who\u2019s a parent. Could I do it? Sure!

The issue in that case isn't so much that the characters being vegan makes meat-eaters uncomfortable, but the fact that the reality depicted is slightly \"wrong\" can make all readers feel a bit like the story is uncanny, which could harm the reading experience of a story meant to feel \"real\". \n\nBut this isn't necessarily true of every way to portray an all-vegan cast in every genre-- if the story is fantasy, making an all-vegan cast would just feel like it's a detail about the fantasy world, or in a scifi it could feel like a statement about the sustainability of diets which include animal products on a spacefaring race, ect ect.

But that's as far as it goes - it's not a particularly big deal, just something that might be off-putting to some readers. Which is why, third, by getting \"harsh\" you guaranteed that you're the AH here.  \n\n\nAnd I think she's right that characters being vegan makes you uncomfortable. You say the food is a small part of the writing and the characters' veganism is implied. And yet that was enough to make it worth it to you to not only offer feedback about (which was fine) but to insist she has to take your feedback, argue with her, and by your own admission get harsh. That's fucking wild dude. Think on that", "Wow YTA majorly. If she wants all of her characters to be vegan then that\u2019s her in-world universe and her choice.

For example, there's not 104 year-olds running around that have skin that sparkles like diamonds in the sun\n\n>and making all of her characters be vegans was going to alienate potential readers and make them uncomfortable.\n\nYeah, I feel _super_ alienated and uncomfortable that no one is eating meatballs or a bacon butty at any point. I really felt alienated when the Cullens ate animals instead of humans, because I just really couldn't relate\n\n>asked if them being vegan made me uncomfortable, I told her they didn\u2019t but it did break the immersion for me because of how unrealistic it was.\n\nAgain: _fantasy_ my dude\n\n>Then she made a snide comment about how I write fantasy, despite the fact that that\u2019s a completely different situation.\n\nAhahahaha. No it's not, it's completely the same situation \n\nYTA, it literally does not matter that they're all vegan", "Lol!!!

I know if I read it, I would find it strange, and if it is really cast in your face, especially as morally superior, the book would quickly go back on the shelf. Someone is vegan? Fine.

As long as she's not ranting about the Vegan lifestyle what is your problem?\n\nA person writes the story they want to write.  You as a beta reader can make suggestions, but the best advice to anyone getting plot/story suggestions(as opposed to grammar) is for the WRITER to follow THEIR vision of the story.   What you did is try to bully her into writing YOUR vision of her story.  \n\nSo if a fellow writer decided to write a story with an all Asian cast or all Black cast, you'll tell them to rewrite it because the REAL world isn't populated with just Asians or just Black people?  If a publisher, likes the work a few vegan foods are not going to put them off of the story.  At worst they'd ask them to offer some more neutral suggestions.  Just as you could have done.  \n\nThere are TONS of \"vegan\" acceptable foods that also work for Omnivores.  Like PASTA or If made with the correct brands a Peanut butter and Jelly sandwich could be vegan.  There are vegan versions of cookies, and many \"traditionally\" meat dishes.

Your advice is just that--something to think about and evaluate if it helps her writing.\n\nAnd that you write fantasy--the ultimate wish fulfillment but criticize her writing as such is rather ironic.  \n\nApologize to her, And if you truly thing this could hold up her being published suggest that she include some foods that would be popular with both omnivores and vegans as a SOP to the publishing world.  Otherwise, don't expect her to share her work with you again because you've judged her and NOT the quality of her writing.", "YTA. You gave her feedback about them not being vegan that's cool. Then you decided to push it and became the AH.", "ESH - If she is looking to publish traditionally your advice is probably sound enough.  But it is quite easy to self publish a book.  Sure the market is much more diluted and there is no marketing budget like a big publisher would have, but you also don't have to make concessions.  If she is targeting her work specifically to the vegan community it might even do pretty well.\n\nAs a side note if I was reading a book about regular every day people and everyone was vegan it would also break immersion for me.  It isn't realistic, and actually kind of off putting/propaganda-y.  But I have yet to meet a vegan that wasn't insufferable, so it might cloud my judgement.

Speaking as another writer, 99% of the time I write only and exclusively queer characters in my stories, and the people reading them have never commented \"don't you think there's not enough cishet characters?\" because they know the I'm the one writing the story.

I think that is fine but you need to temper expectation with regard to popularity and you need actually tackle the moralistic problems with meat eating.\n\nJust shoving vegan eating into the story is going to alienate a larger majority of people than just removing the identifiers, and if you aren't actually adding any meaningful discussion to the discussion it comes off as grandstanding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://twitter.com/TheVeganRD/status/1501952234426286086](https://twitter.com/TheVeganRD/status/1501952234426286086)\n\nVegan people see veganism as something more than a personal dietary choice, and take the moral high ground for choosing the morally \"correct\" decision.

One of the series centered on one group being viewed as \"barbarians\" because they ate meat. They had been part of the bigger group and left to colonize a planet. That first year they ran out of acceptable food, so it was either eat meat or die. Some of the original settlers choose to die for their principles, but others chose to survive. Those who came after them couldn't grow the plants needed to maintain a healthy vegan diet so continued to eat meat. When they were eventually reunited with the main group there had been several generations and they had evolved to live on the planet their ancestors had ended up on with higher gravity. So they were large, needed way more calories to survive, and ate meat.

OP is being not only dramatic, but narrow minded; rn a growing movement towards making stories where different folks can immerse themselves in like black, asian, gay or trans characters... is obvious to assume there's a whole market for vegan people that feel put off for moral/ethical reasons and she's writing for them.", "I love that scene!
