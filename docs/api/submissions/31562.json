Robin is obviously out of line, but why is Julie so deeply hurt by this?", "ESH - The woman calling herself your \"Utah Mom\" is delusional but she is not in your life apart from a few posts on social media. She's not going to stop and you can't control that. \n\nBut I don't understand why Julie is getting so upset about the posting. She's won the competition if there even is one - she gets the glowing posts from you on social media and she gets your love and respect in the real world. And she isn't your \"Utah Mom\" either - she is your mother-in-law and a very important part of your life.\n\nI think you need to stop letting crazy live in your heads rent-free. This woman won't stop because she doesn't really care about you. She wants to look good for helping a neglected child and connected. Her words shouldn't be taken seriously - more with compassion as everyone with real knowledge knows the truth.\n\nUtah is a big state - do the social circles of these two women collide at all? If they do, you might want to put up a once-off post about the situation explaining how you know Robin and how you've drifted apart.", "I think it's more important that Julie realizes you have no control over this person and that you don't sanction what she says and that is that. She should unfollow Robin and not pay any more attention to her. Honestly I'm not even sure why she would be hurt by anybody saying anything. She ought to know how much you mean to her if you tell her, so that should be all she needs.

The way you word this you\u2019re more worried about her being upset than being directly upset about it.\n\nYou can have multiple moms or mother figures.  I had a \u201cwork mom\u201d for awhile-was a fun joke but also acknowledged she looked out for me just starting out.  My mom isn\u2019t so insecure as to be mad at that.  And in this case you\u2019re not even actively involved, it\u2019s past.  \n\nIf Julie cannot trust you when you say Robin is doing that unprompted and really isn\u2019t reflective of your relationship anymore, that\u2019s a trust issue between you and Julie imo.  Robin being stuck in the past is unfortunate but truly Julie should trust you and also, seriously its ok to have multiple \u201cmoms\u201d even if it was active relationship", "Julie sounds nice, but I really don't understand why she's so \"hurt\" by this stuff.

Setting boundaries doesn't make you an asshole. \n\nEnforcing boundaries doesn't make you an asshole. \n\nNot listening to someone's boundaries like Robin is doing makes her an asshole. \n\nAlso if she loved you that much she'd tell her husband to shut the fuck up and she'd respect your pro-nouns and chosen name. \n\nJulie sounds amazing and you should tell her the internet loves her. \u2764\ufe0f", "Block the person calling herself your Utah mom and her flying monkeys on every platform you can. \n\nYou have tried being nice, it didn\u2019t work.", "NTA.\n\nSomething, something, boundaries, something.

You can just ignore her.  That Julie can\u2019t to me is the concern as why not if you have a true relationship?", "Robin may have been kind on my childhood but she's been unkind in adulthood, which is why I struggle so much with this concept of being my 'utah mom' since when I moved to Utah she basically stopped being a mother to me. \n\nI'm beginning to understand that Julie is being a bit strange about it too.", "Hey I'm not saying this to be a jerk--but this comment along with your OP.kinda gives me the vibe that Julie is a little problematic. \n\nI had a fucked up upbringing too--different than yours, but I've learned over the years that it's often easy for me to overlook dysfunction that is less intense than what I dealt with growing up.\n\nJulie is being possessive over you, and I think she's actually probably leaning into your concern about her feelings in order to manipulate you a bit (keeping in mind that people don't have to do it \"on purpose\" in order to be manipulative). \n\nIt's weird that she's so threatened by someone else casually labeling themselves your \"Utah Mom\"--that's actually pretty harmless and just friendly and lighthearted.", "[deleted]", "FYI, if you were trying to quote that text above you just need to add a \u201c>\u201d before the text.

I also have a hard time feeling like I\u2019m \u2018allowed\u2019 to cut someone off if they haven\u2019t been blatantly and overtly toxic to me. If it makes a difference, take this as a sign that all of us internet users are \u2018giving permission\u2019 for you to block her. You don\u2019t officially need our permission, but maybe it will help?", "That was my thought too; I get that it irritates OP but I didn't understand why Julie was so upset over the FB posts. Kinda strange", "I feel the exact same way. Idk why Julie needs to make it a competition/exclusively thing.", "Agree. Julie has never met this women and is letting a light hearted sweet statement bother her. Why cant op have 2 utah moms? Why does Julie have to be so controlling?
