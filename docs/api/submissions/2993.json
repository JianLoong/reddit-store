You can eat when you are hungry. This is a bad sign. Are there other areas in your relationship when he behaves like this.", "Your bf is an immature controlling ahole that might never grow up \u2026 only manipulative people do these kind of actions to \u201cpunish\u201d you for actions and btw you are free to eat whatever you want whenever you want \u2026 I hope you can figure out how to move on from this jerk and soon", "NTA that is a weird overreaction on his part", "NTA and you bf is weirdly controlling. Lots of people snack while they cook. It wasn't like he was cooking and you proceeded to eat and then not have dinner.", "**NTA**, but here's what you really need to consider and understand about your boyfriend's behaviour vs. yours:\n\n>What if I had a breakfast burrito but still planned on eating the dinner? When is it actually considered rude is my question.\n\nNothing. Nothing you eat is considered rude as long as you were still going to be hungry enough to sit down and eat with him afterwards. Not cereal, not a burrito, NOT A THREE-COURSE MEAL WITH DESSERT. Because what you snacked on - what you eat in general - is none of his business and not for him to control, opine on, or punish you for. HE IS NOT AN AUTHORITY FIGURE IN YOUR LIFE, HE IS YOUR PARTNER. \n\nRude would be you eating so much that you weren't hungry to join him for the meal you had prepared for both of you.\n\nRude was HIM allowing you to spend time and effort preparing a lovely steak dinner for the two of you and then refusing to eat it because . . . you had a snack, and he felt like he had a right to punish you for HAVING A SNACK. I'm sorry, but you are a grown-ass woman. You don't need his permission to have a snack. Ever. \n\nYou are NTA, sweetheart. At all. But take it from someone more than twice your age: he is not just an AH, he is controlling, emotionally abusive, and on a very unhealthy power trip. Please be careful. Someone who takes your snacking personally enough to punish you for it like this is not someone you can trust with your well-being in more serious situations. I would be concerned.", "NTA\n\nHe went to his room like a child (instead of using his words). \n\nIt was not rude by the way. You can do what you want.", "NTA, He is wackadoo.", "What the hell?  Your boyfriend flipped out over that?  Of course you're NTA.  A rational person would have been like, \"Hey, that looks good, I'll go pour myself a bowl!\"", "NTA. Your boyfriend is an overgrown toddler. His selfish behavior likely won\u2019t improve. Seriously think about what the future with him would be like.", "NTA. Get a new bf. The f out of here with that stupid behavior", "Does your boyfriend often blow things way out of proportion? Refusing to eat dinner cuz you snacked on some cereal while cooking is incredibly strange. NTA", "NTA\n\nHe keeps acting like this stop cooking for him.   He missed his last meal ever made by you.", "NTA, that's such an overblown reaction of his.", "NTA - this is absurd. If he behaves this way towards you regularly over such ridiculous non-issues, that\u2019s a major red flag.", "NTA I snack a lot when I cook because I forget to eat sometimes.", "NTA. Why did your BF get so mad for you having a snack?!?\n\nPerhaps something triggered him somehow? Maybe try to have a serious talk with him once he has calmed down to determine why the idea of you eating a snack on your own (especially when you are already cooking for the both of you, so... not so selfish, eh) upset him so badly.", "You=NTA Boyfriend=HUGE CONTROLLING AH. Now I want you to imagine having children with this man. You are just taking care of the kids like you do, bam babby daddy goes astral because you didn't do it according to his rules. The punishment would begin. Yep, life would become hell. I have been married 3x's. Twice to a form of your AH BF. Don't be a hard learner like me.", "NTA. God how old is ur boyfriend 9?? I snack all day long and my boyfriend doesn't but never stops me from eating. I get it having dinner together is intimate and loving.

I'm always way hungrier later if I've eaten cereal than if I had eaten nothing at all. In fact, I usually eat cereal at some point in the evening because my husband works nights and we sometimes don't have dinner until after 10 pm. \n\nNext time eat your dinner **and his** while maintaining intense eye contact. Then dump him.", "NTA. Eating is intuitive. You eat when you know you need to eat. He could have grabbed a bowl of cereal himself as an appetizer too, but he chose to have a strop and not eat dinner at all! And made you eat dinner without him even though he was annoyed you'd eaten without him...", "NTA, I do that all the time. Your bf behaviour is childish and immature, maybe you need to reconsider your relationship", "NTA \nbut WTF did I just read? ! You don\u2019t need his permission to eat a snack. The fact that you are even asking this question on Reddit makes me wonder how much you have already internalised his weird controlling behaviour. Also very interesting that you were the one cooking dinner. What was he doing ? Besides throwing a tantrum ?", "NTA That's a massive overreaction.", "NTA - I tend to snack while either my husband or I cook and still eat what\u2019s made. Not a big deal. A super immature reaction on his part.", "He\u2019s willing to intentionally starve himself to make you feel bad because you *ate a snack* while cooking. Gonna say NTA", "Ding Ding Ding.  Out with the old boyfriend and in with a new one.", "NTA.\n\nBut I find curious that you think it is a snack. Maybe it is just me, because sometimes I just eat that as dinner, or most of the times, it is my breakfast.\n\nIt is just a curiosity.", "NTA. It's not considered rude under any circumstance. I could maybe see the argument if you weren't planning on still eating with him at all, but you were literally cooking for him. He should be grateful for that regardless. \n\nThrowing a hissy fit, refusing to eat and refusing to speak to you is the behavior of a child, not a 25 year old man, and is cause for concern. Does he do this often?", "Has your boyfriend never heard of appetizers? NTA", "NTA. Whoa your boyfriend\u2019s behavior is incredibly problematic. Does he often try to control you? Does he often make everything about him? Does he often lock himself in the bedroom? Does he often punish you for not getting his way? Is he often ungrateful?\nThese aren\u2019t simply red flags, these are dealbreakers.", "NTA \n\nDid you eat the cereal with milk ? I wouldn\u2019t consider cereal w/ milk a snack at least for me cause I\u2019ll get full but without milk it\u2019s snack honestly either way it doesn\u2019t matter he definitely overreacted it\u2019s not like he cooked it and you \u201cwasted\u201d his time", "NTA and maybe NAH\n\nThis argument just made me think boyfriend was equally ravenous, but was not snacking before meals because he was raised to believe that it is \"bad behavior\". Maybe talk. If his stomach is clawing at his back and he grabs a snack while you are cooking dinner you are not going to get mad and think he did a bad thing and ruined his appetite.\n\n>Is cereal with milk not a common snack?\n\nIt is not a common snack where I am from(Western USA), a bowel of cereal with milk is a meal a handful of dry cereal, or a cereal bar is a snack.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have low blood pressure, so many women do.  I can't cross that with low blood sugar without really bad results.   Cooking is work.  Standing,  chopping,  constantly on the move from the fridge to the chopping block to the stove.  And your brain has to be able to think logically.  Food helps achieve these tasks.   Just explain that you were too depleted to do the necessary tasks for supper without a snack.  If he wants to help with supper,  he should.", "NTA.

He is a grown man showing you that he has no impulse control, and no ability to regulate his own emotions or behaviour. That makes him dangerous.
