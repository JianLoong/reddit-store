What\u2019s the shocker is that you would accept these panic attacks just to keep this horrific relationship? You\u2019ve learned a valuable lesson. This is why you don\u2019t buy a house with a roommate. One person buys the house the other pays rent. That way, there\u2019s always an out.", "Why his mother still owns a key after all this shit she pulled, is beneath me. I\u2019d run away from this family. NTA", "NTA.  I was iffy until I saw bed bugs.  If anyone gave me those once let alone twice I would never ever ever interact with them again", "NTA.  You didn't set up these boundaries because you are crazy, you set them because your personal and private property was suffering as a direct result of people coming and interfering in your space.\n\nAdd to that, the mental issue, compounded by a very real pandemic making everyone more on edge in this kind of regard....\n\nIs a complete ban on people a bit extreme?  Absolutely.  Do the circumstances here warrant it?  Quite possibly.\n\nI'd be pretty miffed myself if I'd had to pay MULTIPLE TIMES to have my place fumigated as a direct result of someone coming over uninvited.", "NTA. Have no idea why these other people are allowed so freely in your home. They should not have keys!\n\nAnd LEAVE your BF! Calling you \"crazy\" is straight up gaslighting! A good friend just got out of a marriage with a husband who was doing the same thing to her; she waited too long, and it took over two years for the divorce to be settled, but now she's free. Look after yourself!", "NTA but please seek some help.\n\nAs far as you not wanting your boyfriend's mother in the house, why on earth, given the circumstances of her actions re-decorating, snooping and introducing infestations, have you and your boyfriend not taken back the key or changed the locks so no one can enter whilst you are not present?\n\nAnd frankly, whilst you've had a rule since 2020 of no visitors to the house due to the anxiety this has caused, a lot of people have been doing that, or at least significantly restricting visitors, for much of the same timeframe due to Covid concerns anyway. So I don't see that he would have significantly missed out.", "NTA, and personally I think you're with the wrong guy. If you had to fumigate 5 times he obviously has or doesn't want any control over his mother. I swear I got PTSD from fleas, I feel your pain", "Ok, so first things first, NTA. But you do need therapy because if you ever have kids do you know how much they are going to despise not being allowed to have their friends over? Your problem is with one specific person: your mil and maybe your in laws in particular. So what you are doing is trying to make very specific house rules to target those people rather than just dealing with the problem, which is the MIL. \n\nAnd what\u2019s worse is that your bf knows that his mom is the reason that you made such a bizarre \u201crule\u201d in the first place and he\u2019s trying to play it off as if he thinks she\u2019s the exception to the rule. Lol. He has to know that you won\u2019t buy that excuse, so he tries to gaslight you instead. No, I\u2019m sorry but this guy has to go. He\u2019s the real AH", "NTA - Pardon my French, but fuck that guy and his entire family. Right all the way off. That was so disrespectful I can't even. This is your home, not theirs. And if your boyfriend can't respect your boundaries that his own family has made you enforce, I would seriously reconsider your relationship. And calling you names is just so immature that it's almost funny. That is something I would expect from a child. Calling you crazy is a huge red flag for future problems. I can see him disregarding any issues you experience. I would run. Hell, in my own life, I waited too long to leave when my own partner started doing that. It's just the first step towards worse behavior. \n\nAnd the mom just coming over and basically contaminating your home is just disgusting. Makes me skin crawl. \n\nIf he want's \"HIS FOLKS\" over so much, he could go see them. He isn't trapped in the house like Rapunzel in the tower.", "NTA in this, your hubs is TA.  Also, talk to a locksmith, get a new lock installed where YOUR COPY of the key is the only one that can be copied.  And possibly think about a lawyer.  Because if he knows how this affects you, and he still does this, how much does he care for you?  He\u2019s showing no respect for your boundaries, and neither is your MIL.", "NTA though you need more communication with your boyfriend, maybe even with a counselor, to arrive at a unified decision you both can live with.  Your house should be your sanctuary, and if they are going to interfere with that, out they go.  I get that it's a home to both of you, but he should be able to see that they're not behaving like proper guests, and what it's doing to you.  You shouldn't even have to ask, beyond that.", "NTA - your home is supposed to be a safe space and you that\u2019s continuously been violated to where it\u2019s become the opposite. \n\nAlso, major red flags with your BF for referring to you as crazy for having panic attacks. That\u2019s not proper treatment from a partner and shows that he\u2019s not there to support you and that\u2019s unlikely to change.", "NTA. So let me get this straight, you both own this property together. That gives you as much of a say in what happens as him. They turn up when you're at work and start rearranging your belongings without notice or permission?\n \nYour boyfriend needs to set boundaries. None of our families have keys to our house, and even if they did they would never do anything like this.\n \nAs an aside, I do think therapy would be beneficial if you're making your BP that high, but I understand completely why you'd freak out over it, especially when they're bringing infested crap over.\n \nI'm sorry to say that if your boyfriend won't budge on this, I'd be rethinking the long term sustainability of the relationship. I'm really angry for you.", "NTA\n\nyou didn\u2019t say no people for no reason. His mom caused you to have to fumigate your home *5 times*, that\u2019s wild!! I can completely understand why you reacted the way you did. \n\nThink really hard if this is a man you want to stay with. He doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries, he calls you crazy and stupid, he doesn\u2019t care that his actions caused such a bad panic attack, he doesn\u2019t really seem to care about you at all. \n\nIf a man called me crazy and stupid I\u2019d be gone.", "Oh no, this sucks. It sounds like this marriage is not going to last. NTA", "NTA. You had a panic attack about people coming into your home without your knowledge and wrecking your shit... Because people were coming into your home without your knowledge and wrecking your shit.\n\nDitch your BF. He's either an AH, stupid, or a stupid AH. However you shake, you need and deserve better.", "NTA\n\nYour husband knew his mother was one of the reasons for your panic attacks and did it anyway.   You aren't isolating him if he's free to visit them when ever he wishes.\n\nHead on over to r/JUSTNOMIL. check their sidebar and look for resources on how to get your husband's head out of the FOG.   Or get a divorce lawyer.", "NTA.  I hope your name is on the deed, I would call the relationship off.  Not allowing people in the house when you are not there is not working", "NTA..you should feel comfortable and clean in your own home. Honestly,  decide now if these types of situations are something you wanna deal with forever before you get married,  if that's on the table. They're always going to be his family. If he's not willing to take your feelings into consideration and compromise in some way, then perhaps it's not the relationship you wanna be in. Just my two cents", "Nta. His behavior is abusive. This is divorce level \nAbusive. I left my last relationship due to this level of disrespect. If his mom is at the level you described you should call APS. She needs help.", "Not the asshole. I understand that he might feel offended but ultimately your in laws are treating your house horribly and cause you a lot of stress. That's not okay. It sounds like you gave them multiple chances and if they keep doing this then your reaction is fair", "NTA, and I don't think your boyfriend is good for you, you may want to figure out a way to live separately from him, at the very minimum get a separate room from him and have locks on the door only you can open because he clearly doesn't have any grasp on privacy and how having your space not only invaded, but altered in many uncomfortable ways is a big violation. Also, those are horrible relatives, guests shouldn't behave that way ever even if they are related.", "NTA. Yeah, it's your BF's house too, but he's blatantly disregarding your feelings and putting his family ahead of you  and your health. Do you really want that in a partner?", "NTA\n\nGet some professional counseling. I went through something very similar. I had awful postpartum and I stopped cleaning my house. Since I was a single mother by choice, there was no one else to help me with it. I was too ashamed to ask for help. The house became worse and worse over the years. NO ONE was allowed in my house. Not my friends, not my family, not my son's friends. NO ONE.\n\nI finally asked some friends to come help me clean it and it has stayed that way for over two years. I still have minor panic attacks when I think about someone coming inside my house, even though I'm keeping up with the housework. My house is cluttered because I'm still terrible about putting things away but it's not bad by any means. But if someone comes inside, my eyes are suddenly landing on anything that's out of place and I find myself reverting to that shamed state and profusely apologizing for the Lego on the floor or the coffee cup left on the dining room table.\n\nIt might also be time to kick your boyfriend to the curb. It's pretty clear his mother does not respect your privacy or your space and he happily enables her. If neither of them can respect your wishes, then there's a level of disrespect there that can be overlooked.", "NTA- having had to have the house fumigated only once because of his \u201cfolks\u201d is too much! You are perfectly rational to not permit these boundary-stomping, filthy, pest-ridden folks in YOUR home! Your BF can\u2019t have them in his home without them being in your home too. \n\nI agree with breaking up over this. Boundary respect is fundamental.", "ESH.\n\nYour BF needs to set better boundaries for his mom. He's an asshole for not doing so.\n\nYou for unilaterally banning any and everyone from coming over. Want to ban the person who keeps getting bugs in your house so you have to fumigate? That's fine. Want to ban the person who keeps coming over unasked and moving your stuff around, changing the decor? That's also fine. But it's not fine to unilaterally ban everyone. It's your BFs house, too.", "NTA but you shouldn't have bought a house together. See a lawyer. You will likely need to sell the house. I hope your name is on the deed.", "NTA\n\n\nHis mother is disrespectful to your home and has required you to fumigate your home 5 times that has resulted in creating anxiety.\n\n\nYou agreed to the rules, and he not only let them in but screw with your stuff.\n\n\nDude doesn't respect you, put the house up for sale and dump his ass.", "NTA\n\nYour rule is overkill. By a lot. And you need to get some help for your panic and anxiety.\n\nBut he absolutely should not have done that in that way. That was insanely disrespectful. Also, the thing with your MIL is nuts. That\u2019s not cool. Either take the key back or change the locks.", "N t a but the easy solution would be instead of banning anyone from your home you could just ask that your mil does not have a key and that no one is allowed to\nBring boxes or bags of crap\n\nEdit to change judgement on op.

Yet your bf sees absolutely no issue with this? He also has no issue that your mental health has been impacted by his own mother, then has the gall to call you crazy. \n\n\nI have read your replies and you pay most of the household costs and do all of the cleaning so what does your bf really bring to the table? \n\n\nYou also say he has refused to go to therapy or couples counselling, so clearly he has no intention of ever setting boundaries with his mother and her dirty fingers. \n\n\nDo you really want to spend the rest of your life in this situation.

How dare they treat your home like that!! \n\nBoy Friend - it\u2019s totally understandable that he wants to have his own family in his own home, (and trying to stop him is a bit of an AH move, and is possibly abusive) but he knows how upsetting that is for you, and should have managed it better.

Dont complain if you are not doing anything about it.", "So you set a clear boundary, he broke it while you were at work without talking to you, then they did exactly what you were afraid they would do - make a mess out of your personal belongings? \nNTA. \n\nIf something, I think the boundary should be \"nobody comes in, ESPECIALLY your family.\"\nOther people might be more respectfull of your belongings. (Although they should still respect your boundary, of course.)", "YTA - I can understand not wanting certain people over based on their behaviour (i.e. \"please don't invite x over, last time he was here he dix xyz\") but banning everyone?

Keep the spare key in your desk at work and wear the other one around your neck on a shoelace.  It sounds awful, but until you can leave or fix the issue, at least you have your own space that your asshole boyfriend's asshole mother cannot mess with.

Also the boxes etc.\n\nThat said it\u2019s also not right to have panic attacks because people visit the house. You need to see someone about that. Nor is it really right to ban him from having visitors. They shouldn\u2019t be touching your stuff but that\u2019s a separate argument to allowing them to be in the house in the first place. Spying on him via the ring doorbell to see if he has visitors is simply mad behaviour.", "ESH. I understand where you are coming from but it IS his home too and to ban all company from the home is extreme. You need therapy to deal with your own issues. But his family shouldn't have a key.

I'm going to have nightmares just from reading this. Let alone his family coming in when nobody is home, snooping through their stuff, rearranging their stuff, etc. NTA. Your bf is the AH for putting you down, calling you names, not siding with you, etc. If he's going to side with his family over this, he's ALWAYS going to side with his family, including when you have children. His mom will be in the delivery room. She'll be the one raising your child. Please think about whether this is the kind of relationship/marriage that you want, with your bf not being a true partner with you and instead siding with his family.

We lived there less than 5 days. I'm highly allergic to bed bugs. We found out about the allergy on day 3 and got our deposit back the next day. It was the absolute worst month and a half of my life....that's how long it took for the bites to heal. I'm hyper aware of those blood sucking bastards now....damn my skin crawling now, i need 5 hot showers asap.", "Maybe it is time to break up, sell the house, split the money and move on.

If your husband not explicitly consented on this houserule of yours, it doesn't apply to him, period. \n\nBut thats completly irrelevant here. The question you need to answer for yourself is if you will ever feel at home again in your own house and can spend your free time in peace. If not, i think you need to end this relationship, if yes you need to work on a compromise. \n\nEither way i would highly recommend therapy. Not allowing anyone in your home bc of one single visitor is an extreme reaction. I guess most ppl would have simply talked to their partner if its ok to take their mothers key back since she is invading your privacy. \n\nBut honestly, it doesn't sound like you guys have a caring and loving relationship. He gives out keys to your home to ppl you don't want to enter your place on their own, you do unliteral decisions for the house you don't own alone, he calls you crazy and doesn't take your feelings serious... this is just unhealthy overall.", "uhm leave the dude wtf", "Dump this AH, he doesn't respect you. If he did, he wouldn't let his family trash your home. Sell the house and dump him. NTA", "NTA and you need an exit strategy. If you have a joint account your paycheck goes into, end that. Create your own account your paycheck goes into and sock as much money in there as you can. If you\u2019re in the US, you actually may be able to force a sale of the house same as if you\u2019re divorcing - you could do a consultation with a divorce attorney to get more clarity (they\u2019ll have answers even if it\u2019s not a true divorce). Call a domestic violence hotline if your state has one - you qualify - deliberately inflicting a panic attack, financial control, isolation (controlling when you see friends) - all these qualify.

That\u2019s actually disgusting. Also, the fact that they were there a couple hours tops and left the place in such a state just goes to show what an awful family they are. Like when I visit relatives from out of town we sit and chat in the living room, maybe play some board games if the kids are there. We don\u2019t set frogs loose in the house and trash the place. \n\nOP you\u2019re doing yourself a disservice if you continue to allow these people in your life. Get yourself a lawyer and start collecting statements from everyone who saw you break down over this filthy family\u2019s actions.

Your boyfriend is being verbally and psychologically abusive. His mom literally brings bed bugs and roaches into your home. That\u2019s disgusting. End the relationship, sell the home and move on.", "Nta. Dump him and get rid of the house. You have a partner that isn't much of one. As a separate aside, I'm not sure if you're in treatment but it would tremendously. This step would be for you and not him or this specific issue.", "NTA. Sell the house and get away from these people.", "NTA. Dump the bf, change the locks, sell the house and be your best self. You don\u2019t need this stress in your life. It says a lot when your employer cares more for your mental health than your own partner does. \n\nYour boundaries, while extreme, are warranted here. Your bf time and time again has stepped all over them and has completely disregarded your feelings and mental health. What about him makes this relationship worth your time, love commitment and effort when he clearly does not do the same back? \n\nWe know where he gets stepping all over boundaries from when his own mother does it. He won\u2019t change his ways because he doesn\u2019t see it as a problem. \n\nI do think you need some support and help from a therapist though OP. Your panic attacks sound terrifying and dangerous. Not allowing anyone in your home isn\u2019t healthy for you or others living there. Having boundaries and banning certain people is one thing but to go so extreme isn\u2019t healthy nor sustainable but I totally see why you didn\u2019t feel like you had any other choice. \n\nYou do have a choice now though. This isn\u2019t going to change and you have to choose whether this is something you can live with or something you need to cut from your life altogether. YWBTA to yourself if you didn\u2019t choose your own health and happiness over his train wreck of a family and his need to constantly walk all over you and your boundaries.  I don\u2019t like telling people to break up but he has shown he doesn\u2019t care, he doesn\u2019t see a problem and so doesn\u2019t want to change. Break up, give him X amount of time to get his stuff and move out. Change the locks and prioritise YOU.", "NTA.\n\nAnd buy him out or make him buy YOU out, then split up.\n\nI'm wondering if he's doing this to try to destroy you so he gets the house without paying you for it?", "I agree with this persons comment, OP.

I\u2019m doing that on our next hotel stay.", "I had a relative that had an absolutely horrid infestation of roaches. Every place they moved to, the roaches did as well because they refused to just- metaphorically- burn the house down and just leave everything behind and start over. It was so bad, they managed to infest their vehicle as well. Any time I rode with them, I was in a constant state of anxiety, worrying that one would crawl or fall onto me. Anytime this relative would visit, none of their belongings were allowed inside. We used to let them bring in their bag, but we once saw a roach come out of it. Not long after that we \u201ccoincidentally\u201d ended up with a very- thank the universe!- contained infestation, but it was in the absolutely worst possible place- our fucking kitchen!

That is abuse. You gotta get out of there.", "Fixed it thx", "My cat had fleas and it took months to get rid of them. The marks from the bites on my feet and ankles took ages to go.
