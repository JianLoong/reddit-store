I grabbed her phone and laptop and told her she is grounded for 2 weeks and can't have her phone back for a month.\n\nMy wife thinks I overreacted to a kid's joke and I'm an asshole but she embarrased me in front of everyone and I believe she deserves her punishment", "created_utc": 1702312793, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fyq9x/aita_for_punishing_my_stepdaughter_for_a_joke/", "score": 3040, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean, clearly you\u2019re always just itching for an excuse to be mean to this girl. The fact you went through so much effort to detail your relation to her when it has nothing to do with the incident just shows you\u2019re an AH. \n\nShe made a joke. Was it appropriate? Not really, but you can have a conversation about that. \n\nAnd did you punish your son for saying something that\u2019s pretty inappropriate in front of a bunch of people? 9 year olds shouldnt be talking candidly about anyone\u2019s penis in public like that. \n\nBut was her joke at least true?", "YTA. This was a joke from a kid. You embarrassed yourself by overreacting. Also, by your post, you seem to be a terrible step dad.", "Well she was hoping for a reaction and you exceded her expectations. Nice job!\n\nJesus, you don't have to like that your wife is trying to help her abandoned, troubled kid, and I was almost gonna root for you, but if the worst thing she's done is make a crass joke about you and her mom (well look at that, she didn't even put quotation marks around her \"\"\"step-mother\"\"\"), then she's not worse than a healthy teen.\n\nStop being such a cranky, judgemental grump for two seconds and learn to laugh a little. No wonder your step-daughter thinks you need to be taken down a couple notches, I do too.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nThis child has been part of your life for 10 years and you do not consider her part of your family? She is just as much your daughter as she is your wife's at this point. \n\nEither way, you SERIOUSLY over reacted. 15/16 year old girls can be callous brats. Her comment was rude. Your butt-hurt over reaction made you look like a massive AH to the rest of the family. Had you simply rolled your eyes, shook your head and moved on, everyone would have forgotten about it. Then, deal with the consequence later.\n\nThe consequence should be for rudeness. Not your embarassment. Kids embarass us. \n\nToday sit down with your wife and discuss an appropriate consequence. Honestly? Additional chores for a period of time will carry MUCH more weight than grounding. Losing her phone for a month? Do you have ANY idea how much phones are used these days in the classroom? Like DAILY my daughters are expected to scan QR codes. I can see a week. She'll be able to navigate around it for a week, but a month? That is overly harsh.", "Come on OP, such a small thing should not be the reason for getting so much upset", "YTA, \nFFS. She joked that your penis was small, which in context of that stupid game was both appropriate and funny and you went completely off the reservations. \nJust so we\u2019re clear because of your massive over reaction everyone at the party and reading this now thinks your penis is small. \nAlso check what it means to chose invisibility as a a super power. Also your 9 year old singling that body part out really has me questioning you all together", "Uh,  your SON is the one who should be punished!  Wtf is a nine yo doing making such a comment to his father!!  You\u2019re invisible but for your penis?!!  He invited such a retort from anyone!  Your daughter just took the bait. Since you Evidently approved of this game, you should have just laughed it off. YTA.", "YTA  \n\n\nIf anyone should be punished, your son should be. He's the one who started the inappropriate joke. Sounds like it's true based on how you are reacting as well, cause every other guy I know would laugh along with it and shrug it off. A month grounding from her phone isn't fit to the crime, nor is even 2 weeks. It's not her fault the joke was accidentally true, if anything that falls on your wife for going around telling people, especially kids, about your shortcomings in that department.   \n\n\nYou are so cruel, treating her like this over a joke but not the son for also joking that way. So it's okay for a 9 year old boy to make penis jokes, but not a 16 year old girl to make them? Taking the genders out, why is it okay for a 9 year old to but not a 16 year old? It's not \"cuter\" when a smaller child does it.   \n\n\nStop punishing a kid for your dang insecurities. It's not their fault that it was true. Give her her stuff back and apologize to her, you owe it to her for how you treated her. Be a parent figure and instead sit down with her and your son and explain that some jokes can be hurtful instead of grounding. From sounds of it, she hasn't made this joke before, so she couldn't have known it would be hurtful. And your son should also hear this convo as well. Teach them about how to determine if a joke will be hurtful or not sooner. It'll go further in the long run then unjustly grounding one of em will.   \n\n\nTLDR: You went over the top. Your wife is part of the problem for sharing that stuff, your son started the joke. Stepdaughter had no way of knowing that that would be hurtful.", "LOL OP small ween confirmed\n\nYour son is funny, your stepdaughter is funny, you're TA\n\nTbh I had decided that by the time you start dissing your stepdaughter -- should be easy to tolerate the emotional problems of a child **abandoned by her parents** but your shit isn't together enough is it", "YTA. Holy crap. People who act like this shouldn't be parents.", "Do you and your son typically make jokes like this? have you ever considered that you might be making your 16f live-in clearly not-daughter uncomfortable?\n\nI would argue that this girl has probably been through a ton, being abandoned by her family and now having to live with a man who clearly doesn't like her. It must be incredibly uncomfortable and difficult for her. And add teenage hormones to that. Yikes. \n\nYes, YTA. If you don't want the teenager making penis jokes, don't let the 9yr old make penis jokes either. It has to be fair across all the kids.", "Well, and now you've outed yourself to Reddit that you have a small penis.\n\nYTA", "YTA Learn how to take a joke and commend her quick wittedness!", "YTA here bud, feels like you have a few insecurities to deal with. Yea punish her and ground her but you were excessive.", "YTA.\n\nYou have completely missed the part where your 9yo son set you up for that.  He has either s been playing this game with his friends for some time, or he's a genius at improvisation.\n\nHe is the one who brought your penis into the discussion. Why no punishment for him?\n\n\"Technically\" this girl is your niece as well as your wife's niece.  But if she took her in before you got together, I can see how you would consider her a step daughter.  \n\nMy wife and I are parents and step parents.  Our rule was always that the parent made the rules and applied any discipline, and the step parent supported them in front of the kids and made any concern known in private.   I suggest you leave any discipline to your wife.", "ETA E-S-H -  To - YTA.\n\nYou completely ignored the fact that your son started the joke. Besides he should have been stopped the moment penis was uttered. Jokes involving it don't really end well.\n\nYour daughter piled on to your son's joke. So in theory your son deserves punishment too. Your differential treatment of your son vs your daughter is a recurring issue and that clouded your judgement.\n\nYou should have discussed the consequences with your wife before handing out a harsh punishment. \n\nThe way you speak about her is telling of the resentment and disdain you hold for her.", "My partner would have retorted back something along the lines of \"well, this tiny thing is gonna nail yo mama tonight.\"\n\nWhich is almost sure fire way to send teens scattering. \n\nReally? You got all huffy over a joke from a teen? Did she hit home?  I don't get it, lol", "OP, explain why it was 100% OK for your son to talk about your p*nis but your daughter gets a harsh punishment for the follow up? YTA", "YTA if only because you feel the need to clarity it's \"not really her daughter\".\n\nAlso, you're saying she teased you \"in front of everyone\" after saying it was a small party, family only. Yes it was rude but you're over-reacting.", "It's really not a good sign that you have to outline the ways this girl is not only not related to you, but also the ways you believe she's not *really* your wife's, either.\n\nBrutal.\n\nYou are determined hold this kid at arm's length, and make sure everyone knows she is not your kid.  Even if she's as bad as you say... she got abandoned.  She needs professional help in addition to a supportive family.  I mean, pushing away step kids sucks, but to even try to distance your wife from her is a whole other level.  I wonder how long she's lived with you?  Every kid is inclined to be bratty, rude, and annoying without active parenting-and that includes involvement, affection, and encouragement, privacy and space just as much as it includes punishment and rules.  Sometimes, when people complain about the kids under their care, it's hard not to view it as them shouting in the mirror.\n\nBut even aside from your relationship, why it's bad, how it got bad, whether or not you can do anything about how stepdaughter behaves, whether you want to change how you view her, etc- yeah, YTA.\n\nIt was a rude joke, but you always could have just said, \"That's rude, and you definitely shouldn't be making jokes about grown men like that.\" Maybe sent her off without her laptop or phone for an hour or two, but besides that, went overboard. If she really is this awful, then everyone present is used to her popping off and wouldn't really think twice about her saying something rude again, so although being embarrassed isn't something you can help, acting on it in an extreme way to make a show to everyone else is something you can choose not to do.  Also kind of inappropriate for your son to start with the penis joke to begin with, but I notice that doesn't seem to be a problem.\n\nI mean, you don't really care what stepdaughter thinks about your junk, right?\n\nRight?", "YTA - If you had simply rolled your eyes, it would have given her joke no traction. Because you overreacted the way that you did, you basically told the whole world that you are insecure about the size of your penis.", "Son makes joke about Dad's penis \ud83d\ude06\n\nDaughter makes joke about Dad's small penis\n\n# RAGE\n\nIf it wasn't clear YTA and sounds like you have either have issues with your body or women.", "Probably YTA tbh. That sounds like a hilarious roast to me and I feel like you could have just laughed it off.\n\nI say probably, though, because we don't really have enough info. In some families that kind of humor might feel appropriate and in others not. If your wife accepts and encourages that kind of humor in your step daughter and you don't like it, that's a conversation you have to have with your wife \u2013 and then separately with your step daughter.\n\nAlso, the fact you don't seem to have a problem with your son talking about your penis but you do have an issue with your step daughter making a joke about it also makes it seem like you might have reacted because 1. You felt emasculated 2. You just don't like her.\n\nMain issue, though, is that we don't know if you have previously tried to establish boundaries around this type of humor. If you reacted that way without ever having set any boundaries for that type of behavior then definitely YTA.", "YTA \nIt was a joke\u2026", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 the way you're just confirming to everyone how insecure you are about how small your dick is with this post makes me so happy. I'll vote officially YTA but leaning toward everyone sucks here cause I find it unlikely mom doesn't know you treat her daughter differently which means she's allowing it by staying with you. You just suck for being so insecure about your dick size you have to bully and dominate children to feel powerful in compensation.\n\n-edited to make it clear I'm mocking him for being so insecure about his size he has to attack a child, not his size himself. All dick sizes deserve love.", "YTA. Let\u2019s just be real - from the way you\u2019ve written this, it\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t like this child. She will never win with you - your son could have made that joke and you would\u2019ve laughed. You just don\u2019t like her, and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t like the joke.", "YTA. Have you ever spoken to a teenager before? I\u2019d admit it\u2019s a bit of a weird thing to say, but she was just joining in with her little brother. Teenagers say innapropriate stuff, and it shows a little favouritism that you punish her not your son who brought it up. Also, it was kinda funny and you just made it a lot worse for yourself by reacting, as more people will have taken notice.", "YTA\n\nYou over reacted\n\nBossman, let's talk.\n\nDid your wife actually tell your daughter you have a small penis or was she just having a larp? Did you publicly punish her? If you wife is having conversations like that with a child, you need to talk to your wife.\n\nThat being said, you shouldn't punish her for this. It's clear that this girl has no rules or structure in her life. You need to punish her when she is breaking rules. This is something you have a chat about, and if it happens again you punish her.", "YTA.  Seriously, you can't have a battle of wits with a 16 year without going all 'I'm in charge, yer grounded'?  \n\n\nAnd seriously, you got emberassed by a 'yer penis is small, herrr herrr' joke.

A 16 making a small dick joke is pretty par for the course. Was it rude? Sure. Was it true? Almost definitely based on that reaction. And now everyone knows. \n\nBTW, why was it cool for the blood related child to make a dick joke but not the adopted one? It can\u2019t be due to blatant favoritism. No way.", "YTA\nFirst of all it was a joke, whether you thought it was funny or not. But my thing is you don\u2019t seem to consider her your kid therefore it\u2019s not your place to dole out a punishment for her. Leave that to your wife.", "YTA -  Your son was far more out of line, and you should have shut this down after the word penis.   He was far more out of line.", "You 'try to tolerate her', do you? That's very big of you. YTA", "YTA. I\u2019d be more angry at your son. I can just imagine the favoritism that you run your house with.", "YTA. Jesus, that was actually a funny joke, given the silliness of your son choosing to say you'd have a visible penis. You were actually embarrassed? Are you kidding? Maybe get a little thicker skin. I honestly cannot understanding being okay with your 10 year old making the joke he made, and not be okay with the 16 year old chiming in. In the context of the conversation/game, there really wasn't anything wrong with what she said.\n\nYou have a big chip on your shoulder when it comes to this girl and you took it out on her. It's actually disgusting given you've been married 10 years- is that how long she's been in your lives? Because if so, you are her dad figure and you are acting like she's just some annoyance you put up with, rather than a child that is functionally your own. Maybe take some responsibility for how she's turned out. If not, she's a teen that was abandoned by her parents and she likely needs therapy and loving support.\n\nThat was a major over-reaction, and you are a major a-hole to go grabbing up all her electronics and demanding a 2 week punishment for a silly joke. You're an even bigger AH for no doubt ruining the party with your sh\\*tty attitude.", "YTA. You totally overreacted and gave this teenager exactly what she was looking for - a big reaction. \n\nMy god, men and their penises... nobody else thinks they're as special as you do, ok? Nobody else is as concerned... \n\nYour reaction caused more embarrassment than the joke - immature jokes are expected from teenagers... immature reactions are not as expected, and therefore more memorable.", "YTA\n\nI absolutely agree what your step-daughter said was rude. And I'd also understand if you wanted her to get in some sort of trouble for it.\n\nHowever, the blatant favoritism here is ridiculous bull. *Your son* is the one who started joking about your dick. Your son is the one who started with the embarrassing you in front of everyone by joking about your dick.\n\nYet . . . he's not in any trouble at all? And only your step-daughter is a brat? What a double standard.\n\nYou overreacted to your step-daughter and underreacted to your son. She should hate you and will keep being rude, since you're unlikeable and unfair to her. (You may well be likeable to other people you treat fairly or spoil, like your rude son who gets away with it.)", "YTA\n\nDude, just.....dude.  Your son is allowed to talk about your penis and make a funny joke about it, but your stepdaughter can't?  Come on.  Now the whole internet knows you have a tiny penis and are insecure about it.\n\nYou way overreacted.  Grow up.", "YTA. She made a joke and you immediately punished her hard. Even your comments of her being the bratty, rude and annoying are taken with a big grain of salt right now.", "Are you as angry at your own son who set up the joke? If he gets a pass because \"boys will be boys\" or bc you think she's old enough to know better then I think your issues with your wife's \"adopted\" daughter are personal. It also could be that she's picked up on the fact that you don't like her and saw it as an opportunity to get a good dig in at you. I remember once at a time in my life I was achieving some health goals going to dinner with friends/acquaintances. One person casually pointed out that I looked great \"except for my arms.\" I have to be honest and admit that her comment bothered me for a long while. In my mind I thought, *what's wrong with my arms, what do you even mean*?\" But I never said a word to her about it ever. She was a grown up who sometimes could say provocative things and thrived on drama. Best to not react and move on. In your case, we're talking about children here who are honestly just learning how to sort out what's appropriate and inappropriate and skirting the lines for sure! Your reaction revealed much about your insecurity. And your punishment was about your wounded pride rather than her actual offense, and that's a terrible place to be if you hope maintain any degree of self respect. You may not actually care about having her respect because you don't like her, but you're setting a terrible example for your son who will either grow up to emulate or resent you.  Or both. If you could find it in your heart to actually care about this girl instead of merely tolerating her, you might be able to help create the safety and emotional support she needs to thrive. Instead of just demonstrating that most of the adults around her are emotionally immature and hold her to standards they cannot seem to meet themselves. YTA", "YTA.   \nYou totally went overboard to a teenage joke. Your \"daughter\" is a child is allowed to make mistakes in taking a joke too far. You chastise them and tell them the joke was inappropriate so they learn to not do it again. They are just learning what the rules are when it comes to humor and need to learn by making mistakes where the lines are not to cross. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis incident says a lot about your lack of ability to handle shame and embarrassment. You are an adult and should have already learned the life lessons needed to recognize that your punishment does not fit the crime. Your brain should have recognized that there wasn't any real threat from her unfortunate joke, but instead, you had a full-on fight or flight response as if you were being attacked by a saber-tooth tiger. Your over reaction and desire to punish is an indication that you lack empathy for others. It doesn't matter that this child is not yours biologically. You are punishing a child for making a mistake instead of helping them learn from it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are teaching this child that they cannot trust you and cannot count on you to behave appropriately. You're actually increasing the chances that they will not respect you, but now not just in a joking way based on a generic joke that isn't even about you, but because you are actually not deserving of their respect. You are trying to force them to respect you by inflictng this punishment. But respect needs to be earned.", "Yta I was ready to make a Nta judgement based on the first paragraph, but why she got grounded is some real pencil dick energy. Just because the joke was true, it was true by accident. Or was it?

And you should have been consistent and either punished them both, or not at all.\n\nBesides that it sounds like therapy might be a good idea if your stepdaughter hasn't already had some after being abandoned like that. That abandonment probably did a number on her and might be a driving force behind her behavior.", "YTA for overreaction.

If you must, discuss later (in a CALM manner) why this comment was inappropriate and ask that the child be more considerate in the future.

It's sort of like verbal tag. \n\nWith that in mind: could be she's figuring out boundaries and what's generally funny and what's only fun if everyone is playing, and what you need to be careful about because it could go too far...\n\nI'm not saying that's definitely what happened here - I'm just saying I'm not certain it's *not* what happened here.", "Does \"haha pee pee\" need to be addressed?", "spanking wouldn't have such a bad rap, if all followed Granny's advice.
