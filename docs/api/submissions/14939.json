Just some background on expenses \u2014 We\u2019re planning to pay out of pocket for most things, specifically so we can make decisions on expenses without feeling bad or feeling like we owe anything to anyone. My parents are a bit traditional so they expected to pay a significant chunk, but I told them they didn\u2019t have to and they could buy my dress if they really wanted to contribute (I haven\u2019t started shopping yet so the cost is irrelevant at this point).\n\nMy mom has always loved decorating cakes. Sometime in her teens or 20s she took a cake decorating class and she\u2019s done a lot of cake baking/decorating but just for small family and friend events (birthdays, anniversaries, etc.). Her cakes are generally aesthetically great with maybe some minor imperfections once in a while. Structurally \u2014 pretty sound and she\u2019s done multiple tiered cakes too. The one thing is that I cannot really remember a time when she\u2019s made a cake from scratch. She usually uses some sort of boxed cake and a tub of the premade buttercream.\n\nMy mom has been thinking about the design for my wedding cake, and even had a dream about how it would look. My fianc\u00e9 and I really want a baker to make the cake for vanity reasons, and hell\u2026 we want to have fun sampling some really good freaking cake. We have friends and family traveling in from out of state, and we want every detail of the wedding to knock their socks off.\n\nMy aunt is also getting remarried and when my mom offered to bake the cake my aunt declined saying she \u201cwanted a really specific look for the cake.\u201d If I also declined I feel like I would really hurt my mom\u2019s feelings. \n\nI\u2019m terrible with confrontation so I\u2019ve been holding off on this conversation. I\u2019ve thought of her doing the cake topper for us, then having a baker mass-produce individual cupcakes. Having a destination wedding so transport isn\u2019t feasible. Not having a cake and doing other desserts. Anything to keep from crushing my mom, but I think I\u2019m either going to have to suck it up and tell her or have her make the cake. \n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I tell my mom I don\u2019t want her to make my wedding cake?\n\nUPDATE: Thanks all for all the feedback. I talked to my fianc\u00e9 and we decided we\u2019ll have my mom make a small display/cutting cake for him and me, then we\u2019ll have multiple cupcake flavors from a baker. It\u2019ll also go best with our dessert table/ice cream station we plan on having. I like the look of florals on cakes so we think this will be a great opportunity to have her involved with the baker AND the florist. I\u2019m also going to tell my mom I need her help the week of with decorations. She made beautiful centerpieces for my aunt\u2019s fall wedding (pumpkin-shaped lanterns with faux plants), so I\u2019m excited to see what we\u2019ll come up with for my spring-time wedding.

I would tell her, honestly, that weddings cause a lot of stress and tension and arguments among family and you love her too much to put that kind of potential strain on your relationship.", "NTA. Just tell her you want to enjoy the day and not to worry about the cake.", "NTA, it is your wedding, so you get to pick who does what for your wedding. Would you be OK with your mom baking a groom's cake? That might be a way to include her.", "NTA and tell her you don\u2019t want her to be stressed baking.  Maybe invite her along cake tasting to involve her in the cake.", "NTA\nAre you having some kind of wedding/bridal shower? Ask her to make a cake for that.", "NTA but maybe offer an alternative need for her skills so she feels like she contributes? We not only had a wedding cake but platters of cookies at our wedding to take home. Can she maybe do cupcakes beautifully decorated? Or can she do a cake instead for your bridal shower? Or for a rehearsal dinner?", "NTA. Tell her that you want her to enjoy the wedding and days leading up to it and don't want her to worry about baking, and you want to have memories of her in those days, not being stuck baking or decorating and/or being upset because the cake doesn't look how she wants.", "NTA\n\nIf you want really tasty cake for all the guests and you want to do cupcakes (already perfectly portioned with no need for anyone to cut it), then hiring a pro baker for cupcakes makes a ton of sense and you can even have multiple flavors... then your mom can make a tiny cake for the two of you to cut with a top layer to save if that is a tradition you follow.  That sounds like an excellent (and possibly cheaper) compromise.", "Why not have two cakes?  one for you and for the groom.  \n\nNAH", "How about asking her to make a cake for the rehearsal dinner or a wedding shower or something? And then she will be able to enjoy the wedding without the burden.", "NTA Explain to her that you want a very unique flavor for your cake and can see yourself being a bridezilla about it. Offer to let your mom help you deal with the baker since she\u2019s a cake expert.", "Have (your) cake and eat (hers) too", "NTA. It\u2019s a kind offer, but aside from not necessarily being what you want; it\u2019s a lot of work to bake, decorate, and transport a wedding cake, and it\u2019s not something you or your mom probably want to be worrying over on your wedding day. \n\nYou can always offer to have her make a small cake for the rehearsal dinner or to make a groom\u2019s cake for the day of, or even find her a different way to be a part of wedding preparations in a meaningful way.", "NAH but I absolutely cannot comprehend. I'm not a wedding vision/vain person so I'm definitely not calling you an AH, I know how other women are about their weddings and how perfect they have to be. I would never stop talking about it if my mother made my wedding cake. Serving everyone I love a piece of cake my mother made just to show how much she loved me. I'd never stop talking about it. I'd probably ask her a thousand times if she was serious, if she was sure, tell her she could change her mind if it was too much trouble...I'd brag to everyone I ever met. \n\nAsking her to make a smaller cake is a great compromise. I'm sure she'll be flattered and your guests will have a dessert that looks and tastes better.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine to want a professional wedding cake.", "FYI, deep into Reddit is a confession from a home baker who makes celebratory cakes.

Love this!", "Also, I have seen wedding hack videos where the decorators share their secrets, one of them is that they make sheet cakes in the back to be plated and served right after the official cake cutting, the main layers of the big tiered cake are actually made of Styrofoam or something and decorated just like the topper... so if you wanted a \"big cake\" look, you could still do that with her only making a tiny cake.", "I did mention to her that we might want some unique flavors like a lavender or hazelnut or chocolate ganache, and she enthusiastically said she could make it.\n\nBut having her involved with the baker is a good idea. Others have suggested having her make the \u201cdisplay cake\u201d for my fianc\u00e9 and me, then having a baker mass produce cupcakes.

That way no hurt feelings.", "Sounds like you've already made a decision, but you still have another option. My mom bakes and decorates fairly well, but I wanted a professional for many reasons.
