In no way meant to be an insult, but YOU are a child still, you shouldn't be taking care of her kids.

I\u2019m sorry you are going through this and your mother is clearly a selfish person. NTA. You should contact CPS. They can probably help you out with finding an alternative place to live.

Best of luck to you xx", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like you are very responsible and in need of your own space and own life.", "Not the asshole. Go live with your dad.

They won't remove them unless things are super bad, but if it needs done, then know it's for *their* safety. It's also anonymous, so they won't tell her you called. I know this is hard to hear, but you probably don't have a clue what life is really supposed to be like at your age anymore because you're taking care of these other kids. You will not be able to grow and build a nice life for yourself in this situation. Your siblings will also suffer and have to go through it if you continue to let this happen. It'll happen to the next youngest. And then the cycle will keep on. I know you love your sibs, but do you wish this upon them?", "NTA\n\nYour mom is not only taking advantage of you, this is abuse.

This is male bovine fecal matter, in a big stinking pile from which I would very much recommend removing yourself.", "NTA, you're not responsible for your mother's mistakes\nThis just reminded me of an article I read about people who have too many children, and how they actually like babies but not toddlers and children, so they keep making more to relive the thrill of the baby and then proceed to neglect the kids they already have.

I\u2019m a 41 year old female and do not have children because I had to take on that role starting around 6-7 yrs old.

My mom worked late shifts and my dad didn\u2019t do anything house or meal wise cause that was \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d work. I\u2019d go to school all day and have to come home and clean up the house if it was messy, start homework, make dinner and put things away after, finish homework and then be forced to practice the piano for 30 minutes every night.

My mom is my best friend and so proud of her for finally standing up to him!", "Young OP, I am sorry to read your post and I assure you are NTA and not a bad or selfish child wanting out from this. You have been parentified for too long and it has to stop. Your mum is the parent not you. You are 15 and you are supposed to focus on school, after school hour activities and have a normal life that every 15-year-old should have.\n\nI hope you are able to move to live with dad and grandma or your sister soonest. This cannot go on longer tbh. What is gonna be next once you turn 16 or 17? You having to neglect your studies having to care for the other kids to the point your academic results are affected and might blow your chances going to college/university? OR you having to quit your part-time job or a once in a lifetime internship just to look after the younger siblings?

Whatever happens this is on your mum and it is never your fault", "go already, you should have left yesterday  \n\n\nGo be a kid, hang out with friends, study hard at school.", "I would say you should leave now OP. Before she gets pregnant again.

Why are you raising your siblings ? I am sorry but your dad should have pulled you out of this situation ages ago , if you are feeling too guilty about these kids that are not yours.

It\u2019s NOT YOUR FAULT if she does relapse (God forbid) but you gotta do what\u2019s right for you and that\u2019s leaving\u2026 it\u2019ll also put things in perspective for your mom with all those kids without your help and if she\u2019s not actually already pregnant maybe she will think twice\u2026 sending love !", "This is 100% what this means. A 15 year old wouldn\u2019t have that thought if the situation was different.

You owe her nothing", "I think she pretty clearly is serious.", "Call CPS on your way out too OP. She is only going to pick a new abuse target once you are gone", "When there is neglect and abuse, CPS can take the kids away, place them elsewhere, and get court orders that mother go through psych evals and follow all recommendations, and take a parenting class. They also can require mom and her boyfriend of the week take criminal history checks and deny returning kids based on BF\u2019s criminal or CPS history (if he has any).", "Yeah, but better to have it on hand, rather than hoping her dad did what he was supposed to. Would just make life a little easier at times needed when you have for example your own original social security card on hand rather than dealing with red tape to get it later."]}
