Anything less than that requires the consent and cooperation of the family. So it's remove, or no remove. Generally speaking, you try not to remove. And let's say you do remove. Then the kids are in foster care. Are their lives better than they were before? As I said before, CPS is not a parent. Putting kids in foster care scares them, harms them emotionally, disrupts their education, and interferes with their sibling relationships. So before you talk about removing kids, you have to ask, is the cure worse than the disease? Because, CPS is really good at stopping abuse and connecting families with resources. It's really bad at being a parent, even worse than a lot of rotten parents.\n\nThis whole idea of \"calling regularly\" doesn't make sense. If there's an issue, one or two calls will do it. Regularly calling and saying, \"By the way, these parents are still clueless jerks who are making their kids babysit their other kids for free, and don't have a plan or resources or a future,\" doesn't help. Either one report triggers an investigation, or it doesn't. It's also really painfully obvious when a particular family members keeps making \"anonymous\" calls because they expect a particular result, and they are just not accepting that what they want is outside what CPS can provide. In the UK, as opposed to the US, services have a little more authority and can do more prior to removing the children, but it's still just degrees of the same problem. \n\nThere is no way to just yank people out of a bad home and put them into a good home and go, \"Okay, now these children are fine, case closed.\" The idea there are foster intant-families out there to fix these problems is a fantasy. You ever see the old SNL skit about the insurance company providing a replacement dad/husband when the old one dies? That is about how realistic this concept is.", "I too have worked in child welfare. I also grew up in an abusive home and despite my parent\u2019s arrest for child abuse, the state never acted to remove me. Regrettably. \n\nThe  entire CPS process is about addressing deficiencies in parenting while keeping children safe. As you should know, family reunification is the goal\u2026. And relative placements are preference placements. \u2026.But if the state does nothing (as I did in my case) the abusive/neglectful parent will continue to abuse her children. \n\nI don\u2019t know what state you\u2019re in, but in my state there are processes for legally removing parental rights (putting the children \u201cin care\u201d of the court) while keeping the children placed in the home and court orders on the parent. CPS is the only route OP has to help her siblings.\n\nYou said CPS isn\u2019t a parent\u2026. No, but neither are a lot of people who have babies.", "I 100% get what you are saying. What I am pointing out is that in this particular story, I don't hear anything that would trigger removal. Making lots of babies, sitting on the couch watching YouTube, and making your teenagers babysit the younger kids you are bored with... sucks. But it doesn't place the children in immediate danger or expose them to chronic trauma. CPS might be able to get other agencies involved, but CPS itself generally does not have the toolset or mission to deal with stuff like OP is talking about.", "We are in sibling-cousins, uncle-daddy territory\u2026 I get the vibe there may be some other serious issues going on that we haven\u2019t been told about.", "Always a concern.
