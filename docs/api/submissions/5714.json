While I want my mom to be happy it makes me feel really weird and sad for my younger cousin. it is an understatement to say that her side of the family is angry. Not even a week after her bringing him home she tells me they plan to get married very soon. I told her that If she had another one I will leave. She thought I was joking. About a month ago she found out she was pregnant but miss carried. After that she says she feel\u2019s something missing and that they\u2019re gonna try for another one. The fact that she is trying to have one after nit even fully raising the ones she already had kind of angers me. I wouldn\u2019t treat that child as if they were my sibling and I feel bad for saying that bc it\u2019s not their fault but I wouldn\u2019t.

Your mother is irresponsible and escapist. Do you have somewhere safe to go?", "NTA. You\u2019re 15, your job shouldn\u2019t be to raise children. This sounds like a messy situation all around and getting out of it altogether may be the best option", "NTA, absolutely.  Kiddo, you're a child.  You are not supposed to be your own mother's unpaid nanny.  You should be concentrating on schoolwork and preparing for adulthood outside your assigned role as stand-in parent.  She is being irresponsible.  Sounds to me like she loves babies and can't figure out what to do with children...also, she is lousy at picking partners and/or at being one.  All of these are her problems and she should never have made them yours!\n\nVery quietly find your vital documents (where I am that is birth certificate, proof of insurance, and Social Security card) and put them someplace your mother doesn't look in.  Then tell your dad you need to get out.", "NTA\n\nThat's basically self preservation at this point. Yikes.", "NTA if you can, leave. What she's doing is not okay, it's not your job to raise your siblings, you're a child yourself", "NTA, she\u2019s willing to sacrifice many of her relationships for this man and to try another baby. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this situation", "NTA, from an outside perspective it almost sounds like they're having kids just to fill an emptiness, which doesn't help them, doesn't help the 7 kids that are already there and doesn't help the potentially future kid, it's just a lose-lose situation.", "NTA\n\nIf your father can provide a better and more stable living situation for you, then go. At 15 you should not be responsible for raising your siblings.  With that said, a new child will be your sibling regardless if you like it or not. Shunning the new baby serves no purpose but again it should not be your responsibility to raise the new baby.", "NTA you're only 15, you shouldnt be raising babies at your age! If you have somewhere safe to go, i don't blame you for getting out", "NTA  Leave now, let her actually have to raise her children with out the help of her slave.", "NTA. Your mom is being really selfish and unfair to put it mildly. You are not wrong for expressing your feelings to her and I wouldn't blame you if you went to live with your father. I just hope that that's a safe and positive place for you to be.", "Absolutely NTA\nGo save yourself. What is your mum thinking, getting a kid from every new guy like other people get snow globes from holiday destinations.", "NTA. Don't wait, go now.", "NTA\n\nGet out if possible. Sounds like your mom uses you as a babysitter.", "NTA\n\nIt's your mothers job to raise her kids and not yours, It's unfair of her to take away your childhood, leave as soon as you can and enjoy your teen years as much as you can", "Absolutely 100% NTA \n\nYou have had to endure so much. You\u2019ve lost so much due to the parentification you\u2019ve suffered, (yes this is a very real and very serious trauma issue if not dealt with). It\u2019s not fair your whole life has been affected and large parts ruined by missed opportunities due to you raising your siblings. Not only should you move out but you should call authorities to ensure your sibs get help. You\u2019re allowed a life and you\u2019re allowed to act your age. You deserve to be happy and carefree and to feel loved and cared for rather than the live in nanny", "NTA. If you think your dad\u2019s place will be a better home environment for you, then you should do what\u2019s best for you. Your mom has no right to treat you like a second parent for your siblings just because you\u2019re the eldest daughter. Move to your dad\u2019s house and enjoy the last 3 years of your childhood. \n\nDon\u2019t feel like you need to justify yourself or argue with your mom either; if she asks why you\u2019re leaving, you can give her an excuse about spending time with your dad or any other reason that will get her off your back.", "NTA at all!\nA fifteen year olds first priority shouldn\u2019t be taking care of their siblings. You have bigger things to focus on, and are nearing (if not in) highschool! This situation is sucky because you are related to these kids and may feel a responsibility towards them, but if you are always taking care of them there isn\u2019t going to be time to take care of yourself. Moving to your fathers may even give her the wake up call she needs.", "NTA. You're in a bad situation. You'll be better off getting out. Your mom needs mental help. There's no reason to want to have kids over and over with different dad's. But it is NOT on you to get your mom help. She has to realize she needs it herself.", "NTA.\n\nYou are a child yourself. You have no obligation to care for your mothers other children.  If leaving is the best way for you to break out of that cycle then you should do it.", "NTA. I know you love your siblings but you have the right to be a kid, not a nanny. Your mom may need therapy since she seems to have feelings of inadequacy.", "NTA you need to leave this toxic household", "NTA  I'm hoping as I'm writing this you're packing and on your way to your dad's house. Your mother will continue as long as you enable her and I'm sure when you turn 18 you'll be expected to work AND watch her kids. Please go now and block your mother's number for at least a month or two - do NOT let her guilt you into staying.", "NTA. It sounds like your mom only likes the beginning of things. You deserve to live with someone that lets you act your age.", "My biggest thing on why I haven\u2019t left yet is that she\u2019s been doing really good lately outside of this situation and the constant fighting with her boyfriend. I don\u2019t want to leave and make her mad or put her under to much stress to the point that she relapses and than my siblings really aren\u2019t in a safe environment. As far as Cps we all have been in foster care for about 2 years besides the younger 2 and my little brother really wasn\u2019t treated right.", "Nta.", "NTA. Leave this situation. Your a child. You shouldn\u2019t be raising her children, and for the good of the other children I would encourage you to get authorities involved if you think they won\u2019t be cared for when you leave.", "NTA. Leave and then call CPS.", "Just go ahead and leave. NTA.", "NTA you need to move in with your dad asap. Your mom has a mental health problem and staying will only enable her behavior.", "NTA", "YWNBTA.  But get out.  This is a toxic situation for everyone and you will have to help yourself first, before you can even contemplate helping your siblings.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your job to take care of the children. If your mother is already uncapable of taking care of seven children, why is she even having more? Give her a condom and explain how to use it.", "NTA. Leave while you can. It won\u2019t get better. You don\u2019t need that crazy burden in your life at 15. Consider joining the military when you turn 17 or 18. They\u2019ll take good care of you and you\u2019ll be fine making it on your own after that point.", "Info- why didn't you leave when she announced she was actively trying for a baby?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
