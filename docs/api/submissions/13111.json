I personally did not like Evelyn or her how she treated Natalie. Their friendship ended 12 years ago but Evelyn and Natalie have recently rekindled. At first, it really seemed like Evelyn had changed. We went out with her and her husband and things were fine. I'll say their marriages seemed on the rock but they were still civil. \n\nNow my wife's birthday is coming up but since it was spring break for our kids I decided to book a cabin at a resort as an early celebration. When I told Evelyn she said her and Natalie use to talk about family vacations together when they were younger, so she may like it if Evelyn and her family joined. She promised to even watch our kids one night so we can have our own date.\n\nThis didn't happen. When we got there Evelyn and her husband were fighting. Natalie and I were going to take our kids to the pool and somehow Evelyn's kids got pawned on us because of the fight. Several hours later we came back and they were still fighting. Evelyn didn't ask about her kids or anything, she instead dragged my wife to the bedroom to cry to her about everything. I was left watching all 7 kids by myself. \n\nThe next day everyone but Natalie and the kids were miserable (she's always optimistic). We went to the pool again and Evelyn was very passive aggressive to her husband, making comments he was disgusting in his swimsuit, she couldn't look at him, put his shirt on, ect. In retaliation he got drunk at the swim up bar. The fighting started up again.\n\nNatalie and I were suppose to have our date night later that day, but after we got ready Evelyn insisted she couldn't do watch the kids anymore and to not even ask. \n\nSo in summary, my wife's birthday trip was a disaster. I've been bitter about the whole thing and have questioned if it would be wrong to ask for some money back because of all the free babysitting they received from us.

She behaved selfishly and with no regard for the well being of her supposed friend in your wife, and I\u2019m totally on your side if you want to insist that she never joins you for holidays or social events again.\n\nI will, however, suggest that trying to pursue her for reimbursement is a bad call.  She won\u2019t pay, you won\u2019t be able to recover the money by legal means, you\u2019ll just be inviting more drama that ultimately brings you no benefit.  Take the hit, write off the holiday as an unfortunate loss, learn from the experience.  It\u2019s the only reasonable way to put this behind you.", "NTA You should definitely ask for some money back, imo. Not because you deserve it but because I really want to see what happens next lol", "Info: did you pay for the entire vacation or did they pitch in at all? If so,  what percentage?", "I don't think you'd be an AH, but I wouldn't do it either. Or, if you're insistent on doing it, talk it over with your wife first.\n\nEdit: I see that your wife wants nothing to do with Evelyn anymore either. If she doesn't want to salvage the relationship, go ahead and ask. You won't be getting any money back, but it'll torch the bridge, and you'll be rid of Evelyn.", "I say go for it.

You're NTA.", "YWBTA\n\nI don't think you are one, though.\n\nThis is one of those situations where you just need to draw a line in the sand and accept this is the way some people are, and it's a lessoned learned.\n\nHow far are you willing to take this? Are you willing to come out looking like an asshole (even though you're in the right)? Are you willing to go to court? \n\nI bet the answer is no. \n\nI think you just need to keep your distance from these people and move on.", "NTA but just write it off. I get your mad but since your wife doesnt want to be friends anymore just move on. \n\nThink about it this way atleast the kids had a good time or they enjoyed it.", "NTA Although, unfortunately, bringing it up may not be worth the headache Evelyn will no doubt cause. I just wouldn't make any plans with her/them again.", "INFO: Who funded this trip? Was it solely you or did Evelyn and her husband pay their portion?", "Meh. NTA but you will become TA if you start asking for money.\n\nHey people plan trips they don't always go as planned. It was ruined for Evelyn and her husband also since they were fighting the whole time. IDK it seems kind of petty after the fact to ask for money for what, babysitting? When they were planning to babysit for you but that didn't happen.  All your plans went awry but I personally wouldn't ask for money, just chalk it up as a lesson learned and never travel with those people again.", "Yes YWBTA if you asked for money. It is up to your wife to decide to cut ties with this person.\n\nEdit - Actually on second thought, asking for money back on food/items/activities spent on her children is totally acceptable.", "Not exactly the asshole, but I cannot imagine any legal standing there, because you allowed yourselves to get drawn into it. Cut your losses and learn from the experience.", "I would actually like to see this on a daytime TV Court program... if you had credit statements for everything you paid for for their kids I bet a judge Judy type would rule in your favor. Bonus points if you have texts of your agreements for them watching the kids for you and your wife to go on a date and extra bonus for photos of them being awful to each other", "I'd say you would be the TA just insofar that you're inviting more drama. My advice is to cut your losses, don't ever do something like that with them again, and enjoy the peace of mind that it won't ever happen again.\n\nAlso, hire a babysitter for a night and go bowling or something with your wife.\n\nEdit: typo", "Ywbta if u demanded money back\n\nBUT!\nUre Not TA for feeling bitter or pissed about this\n\nNow you should have deep talk to your wife about that vacation.\n- Evelyn didnt respect ur wishes and broke off the deal of watching the kids.\n- Evelyn bring toxicity to this vacation\n- Have Natalie ever told her to put her toxic attitude aside? Told her that this vacation is about NATALIE'S BDAY not yelling at husband, crying vacation?\n- Explain to her and let her see from ue pov, u wanted a beautiful vacation and date. \n- She need to tell her friend how to act since this vacation 60% paid by u.\n- Tell Evelyn that this is gonna affect a trust issue between her and u and ur wife (if Natalie also feeling the same) and she shouldnt be invited again unless she act like decent adult and own up to her promise.", "NAH. You can try, but don't hold your breath.

Good luck, sound like you'll have better luck getting blood from a turnip.", "NTA you should be compensated for all that free babysitting the other couple got out of it since they were too drunk or absent to care for their kids. This friendship would be done in my book you dont need that negativity in your life.", "ESH. Are you prepared to lose this friendship? Because that's what's going to happen if you ask her to reimburse. If you want to draw that boundary you have every right, but don't be shocked when that's the last time you talk to her.", "YTA in my opinion. I understand you're bitter but turning this into something about money isn't the solution. Making this about money would tarnish that friendship forever and also might strain your and your wife's relationship. \nI would suggest having a talk with your wife about it and explaining how upset you are. If you decide to keep these people in your life (maybe encourage them to get a divorce) then a talk with them is also necessary. If you decide to cut them off, I'd just leave it at that and as my gran always says \"don't pick up shit just to carry it around, let it be\". \nThe best way to move through events like these are communication and a re-do with your wife, and decision on how to love forward with the friend. Unless you're strapped for money I wouldn't bring that into it, it just seems petty.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
