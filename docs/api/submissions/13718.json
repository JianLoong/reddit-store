I was parentified badly, expected to care for and teach and be the \"mature one\" for all my brothers and cousins (of which there are about 30, many of whom are older than me but weren't \"as mature\"). I was held to a much higher standard than all the other kids in my family, even the ones 4-5 years older than me. \n\nAll the pressure and lack of support hit me really hard when I was 16 and in my first semester of college, and I flamed out pretty dramatically and fucked up a lot of really great opportunities, and I didn't even realize I was in crisis.  Took me YEARS to get comfortable with failing as part of the learning process because of all the pressure to be perfect all the time because I was smarter and more developed than other kids my age. \n\nI'm lc/nc with a lot of my family now - NC with ones that are also racist/homophobic jerks, and lc with everyone else because while my grandpa was dying, one of my aunts and I took on the brunt of his care, and after he died, I started filling in his space because I was so much like him. I ended up moving cross country for a lot of reasons, but one of the big motivators was my mom calling me for emotional support and advice when he was gone, as though our roles were reversed. I know my mom is a person in addition to my parent, and that as I grew up, it is normal for our relationship to evolve, but I was dealing with the grief of losing grandad - the person who was effectively my dad - and I wasn't prepared to take on a parental role with my own mother as she dealt with the grief of losing her father. My stepdad has been around since I was 10 and is a really nice, supportive guy who has lost both of his parents at that point, and she has 4 siblings, gets on well with three of them and their two living spouses, and on of the spouses (my favorite uncle, husband of the aunt who was caring for grandad) is also a great dude who had also buried his dad, so it's not like she didn't have other people to go who could relate.", "NTA, but she does not sound like a very good friend. Her rose colored glasses are affecting her vision.", "Oh my God, this reminds me of an old friend of my ex's, who tried on more than one occasion to tell me my then-nine month old son was deaf.

The worst two contenders for the Baby Olympics in my first mums' group turned out to have kids on the spectrum. One is so severe, sadly he isn't in mainstream education and will never live independently.\n\nEnjoy your nice, normal kid... he'll do just fine in life. NTA", "NTA.\n\nTo be honest, I'm scared for little Zoe. No child should ever be treated as if they are \"special.\" This is how narcissists are raised. Not only are they confused that the rest of the world doesn't treat them as special, but they grow up feeling inferior and frustrated. They may also be abusive to their family and friends. It may be time for you to end this friendship. And it sounds like there's absolutely nothing wrong with your child. 2 years old IS a baby.", "NTA. Love your response to her! Also, she\u2019s no longer a friend, just fyi.", "She's been my friend for about 20 years and I can count my friends on one hand, mostly due to unrelated things (i.e. my divorce and my resulting trust issues) so I'm not quick to cut someone off.", "Unrelated but thank you for being a male early educator. People don't appreciate how important it is for little boys to have men in the classrooms from early on!", "Part of that is sexism in parenting and toys.  Toys touted for boys encourage physical play-trucks, sports.  Toys touted for girls encourage more life skills, cooking, cleaning, parenting.", "Been friends for over 20 years and this is relatively new behaviour from her, at least to me. It's hard to just throw away 20 years of history and everything we helped each other through.\nHonestly I'm side eyeing the new boyfriend because he's really the only new thing in her life.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "So you just like use her for a friend ? That\u2019s pretty mean of you.", "I\u2019m sure your son will be able to figure it out in a few years", "At least the friendship is over now", "That\u2019s so annoying. Imagine if you called her child lazy", "It is hard to end a long-time friendship.  I ended my friendship with my childhood best friend a few years ago.  This was a 40-year friendship.  It was not until I called it quits on her and looked back at the last dozen or more years, I saw how toxic she had become.  Our lives were very different.  She had taken the stay-at-home mom route while I went to college and built a career.", "I knew a mom like OP\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d, and her kid was a miserable husk by second grade. She once told me that our seven year olds had an *inordinate* amount of free time at school, and that might be fine for some kids, but her precious genius needed *much more* mental stimulation.", "Nope. Actually the only thing early walking is correlated with is ADHD", "We've been friends for 20 years, it's hard to just cut someone off when this behaviour is only very recent. We have a lot of history.", "Don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be your choice", "I know a mom who had her kid enrolled in violin class and Latin classes because she was so smart.  Her mom told everyone who would listen that she would be going to medical school on scholarship. Then the kid failed her grade literacy test that every grade 10 kid in Ontario has to take. Then she got into university, not medical school, and dropped out in first year. By 25, she was unmarried and had three kids. That\u2019s what braggy moms get.", "NTA. If she\u2019s so good at training, maybe she can start a career as a dog trainer. \n\nHer kid may be smart, however, it sounds like a lot of the stuff she\u2019s bragging about are trained behaviors that are fueled by her own ego. Her self esteem is derived by her daughter which is sad and not your problem. Good on you for calling her out.", "NTA and I feel so bad for Zoe, that girl's going to be ***way*** past burned out by the time she finishes high school, but because she'll be labeled gifted there's no way her mom would let her not go to college. She won't know how to chill out until she goes off the walls in rebellion.", "ESH. Julie's behavior is obnoxious, but your verbal sucker punch went a little too far. You should have just distanced yourself from Julie when she started making all the condescending remarks about your child. She is obviously biased towards her own child and determined to build her own child up by making others feel inferior.\n\nJulie will probably drive away all her friends with this behavior. No mother will be able to tolerate it for long. The best thing to do is start quietly disengaging. Put some space and distance between you and just slowly drift off. Be busy when she wants to make plans. Slow down your response to texts and phone calls. Don't suggest any plans. Stop showing interest in her activities.\n\nYou don't need someone like Julie in your life. You're entitled to be proud of your own child's accomplishments, and that's going to be impossible with Julie constantly making damaging comparison's. She's not a real friend if she want's to make you feel inferior. You don't owe it to her to stick around for that kind of abuse.", "Nta. She sounds ds insufferable.", "NTA it is obvious that whatever achievement her daughter may have is not thanks to her", "I apparently started talking in full, articulate sentences very early, but even now, nearing 50, my drawing and writing look like someone broke all my fingers before they handed me a pen.", "Actually, many services can address people reaching out to them for assessments as a positive when it comes to grant writing and appealing for funds to continue to grow.", "Now I understand!!!!!!", "...and you tell kids that today they just don't believe you.", "So as soon as someone is old enough to see social norms/the culture they should partake in it regardless of what actual experts and research shows?\n\nHere we have a big problem with kids vaping/smoking, drinking and doing drugs. It's practically a right of passage at this point. According to your logic everyone should be doing those things underage because it's just a part of our culture/societal standards. See how dumb that is?", "Breastfeeding a under 2 year old is not weird. I know I was a weird kid because I was eating actual food at one year old which is definitely much weirder. Like, what kid eats broccoli raw for their first birthday?"]}
