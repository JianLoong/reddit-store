Each child is different and their growth trajectories are very unique. Identifiers are necessary to address the concerns, but comparisons are uncalled for. They are biological species, not some top of the line speced out machines to boast about (which also get outdated and obsolete with age).\n\nSurely there are genius children out there who are better than your friend's daughter (going by her innate need to compare) and there are children with lower development than your child.\n\nTell her to stop her shenanigans and you could also refrain from from talking about how irresponsible she is toward her child. Her parenting methods (good or bad) are her decisions and nobody has a say in the matter except her partner and immediate family members involved in the child's upbringing and care.\n\nYou can apologize to her if you still value her friendship, sit down with her for a talk and focus on your child.\n\nAll the best.", "NTA\n\nShe dishes it she can take it.", "NTA - this reminds of some narcissist's I know that get their ego boost buy putting others down.
