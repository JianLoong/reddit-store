I was parentified badly, expected to care for and teach and be the \"mature one\" for all my brothers and cousins (of which there are about 30, many of whom are older than me but weren't \"as mature\"). I was held to a much higher standard than all the other kids in my family, even the ones 4-5 years older than me. \n\nAll the pressure and lack of support hit me really hard when I was 16 and in my first semester of college, and I flamed out pretty dramatically and fucked up a lot of really great opportunities, and I didn't even realize I was in crisis.  Took me YEARS to get comfortable with failing as part of the learning process because of all the pressure to be perfect all the time because I was smarter and more developed than other kids my age. \n\nI'm lc/nc with a lot of my family now - NC with ones that are also racist/homophobic jerks, and lc with everyone else because while my grandpa was dying, one of my aunts and I took on the brunt of his care, and after he died, I started filling in his space because I was so much like him. I ended up moving cross country for a lot of reasons, but one of the big motivators was my mom calling me for emotional support and advice when he was gone, as though our roles were reversed. I know my mom is a person in addition to my parent, and that as I grew up, it is normal for our relationship to evolve, but I was dealing with the grief of losing grandad - the person who was effectively my dad - and I wasn't prepared to take on a parental role with my own mother as she dealt with the grief of losing her father. My stepdad has been around since I was 10 and is a really nice, supportive guy who has lost both of his parents at that point, and she has 4 siblings, gets on well with three of them and their two living spouses, and on of the spouses (my favorite uncle, husband of the aunt who was caring for grandad) is also a great dude who had also buried his dad, so it's not like she didn't have other people to go who could relate.", "NTA, but she does not sound like a very good friend. Her rose colored glasses are affecting her vision.", "Oh my God, this reminds me of an old friend of my ex's, who tried on more than one occasion to tell me my then-nine month old son was deaf. He did this on more than one occasion, until I just told him \"you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.\"  \nNTA.

If she tells her constantly how much smarter she is from everybody and how special she is, she might be in for a nasty shock when she discovers later that she\u2019s either not special at all or that if she is and gets into advanced programs, other kids in those programs will be just as gifted and special as she is.
