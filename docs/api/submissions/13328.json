I've been quite transparent/blunt with him about it over the years as for each trip I'd end up planning 80% of it (hotels, flights, things to do, etc) while he would just find a restaurant or something he'd like to see.\n\nFor a bit more/random context to try and give more insight into my frustration, two years ago he literally did not plan anything for my birthday nor gave me a small gift. We nearly broke up and I was devastated since every year I make plans on his birthday, like reserving seats at his favorite restaurant or ordering limited edition apparel from his favorite artists. Since then we agreed to set days for when we'd discuss our next trip and assign tasks for what each person should be responsible for and check in with each other on those set days for updates.\n\nContext for the current issue: Last year, he was in charge of planning the location for our anniversary in September. April rolls by, and nothing. June, (I assumed) he panics and selects location A. I do my own research and find out it's hurricane season there and not the best time to visit. Another argument occurs and I end up selecting location B. Since we did want to visit location A though, we agree that he will be responsible for planning the whole trip to it in May 2023.\n\nCurrent issue: It is now late March and the trip he's supposed to plan in basically a month and a half is in shambles. He hasn't booked the flights, reserved restaurants, booked or found things to do, etc. Two weeks ago I decided to check on him regarding it and found out he hadn't even reserved a hotel room (which he has recently done). I've told him if the week the trip is planned for rolls in and he hasn't booked the tickets, I'll be taking my own personal trip without him for the entirety of the planned dates to location A. He's telling me that would be selfish and inconsiderate of me. He enjoys traveling as much as I do and other than planning, he's perfect in every aspect and I love him to death.\n\nSo basically, WIBTA for going on a trip without my fiance because he failed to plan a trip he was responsible for?\n\nEDIT 1: For further context on Location A, it is an island that has hurricane season in September. When I brought this up to him and the possibility of experiencing tropical/rainy weather we both agreed on this was something we did not want to experience for our anniversary. After looking up the weather for Location B (which is in Europe and we live in USA) with a rough estimate of travel costs that were similar to Location A, I then mentioned it him where he agreed on going to Location B. I think \"selecting Location B\" was a poor choice of words, but I chose \"select\" as I had chosen Location B to look into and then bring to the table.\n\nEDIT 2: Fiance took it upon himself to plan the trip in its entirety on himself. Lately, I've attempted to discuss with him his current plans because the departure date is coming up, but he has not even booked the flight. Attempts to sit down and discuss it with him have failed as he says that we can talk about it another time (but never do).  \n\n\nEDIT 3: I'm 100% content with planning all trips by myself after receiving his input. For this trip he's supposed to be planning, I wasn't supposed to get involved in it as it's his project. The backup plan I've created just in case is to a city he is not interested in. Additionally, the city has exhibits that conclude in May that I'm interested in seeing and wanted to for my birthday which was in March but did not go. I have a plane ticket that I can adjust without additional charges and the time for work (I have two jobs) has been scheduled off.

Like, I can book flights and a hotel. But that whole list of things you consider essential? Exhausting, and I wouldn't know where to begin.

Him missing your birthday is unexceptable and even after you made a plan to address his behaviors discussed and discussed, and set reasonable expectations and he didn\u2019t improve on his end or try. At this point I\u2019d honestly consider if this was weaponized incompetence, it takes 2 seconds to set a reminder to set aside time to google airfare or a hotel. Go on your trip OP, this is a serious case if it isn\u2019t the consequences of his own actions. You deserve a vacation and deserve not to carry the emotional labor of planning everything. Don\u2019t bring it up again.

I shared with him my frustrations about this and since then he's been doing a lot better at it. I only had to bring it up once. All your fianc\u00e9 is doing is showing you he doesn't care.

Rethink marriage. This isn't healthy.", "So...you're counting on being able to plan and take the whole trip with only a week's notice?  If it's a week away and he hasn't booked anything, but you can still pull off the trip, then the whole reason you're so upset will be disproven: it will be possible to take the trip with short-term planning. How much do you imagine yourself enjoying this last-minute, solo, punitive trip? YWBTA.\n\nYour deeper needs for reassurance that he cares about celebrating your relationship, and for security around making the most of your holiday expenditures, and for being in an equitable partnership where both parties take responsibility, are legitimate. Focus on these and not on the deadlines and nuts and bolts of how and when you plan celebrations and holidays. Ask for specifics like booking hotels by certain dates, but accept if it's outside his capacity to do it exactly the way or in the timing you want it done.", "Expecting him to do things exactly the same way you do or care as much as you do might be natural to want, but is only setting yourself up for disappointment.  He's proven it's not his nature to plan ahead and put a lot of thought into trips/special occasions.  You've shown this is important to you and crucial to feeling valued--and that's 100% okay!  But you're not going to get that need filled by him.  Accept that and make a decision:  he might be a great guy in all the other ways, but can you live without that one thing forever?  Take it from me:  if you view him now as the irresponsible one, he will always be that to you.  \n\nI think YWBTA if you went on the solo trip anyway as a form of passive aggressive punishment and expected to stay together; however, if you took this as a sign of incompatibility and moved on from the relationship and THEN went on the trip, YWNBTA.", "YWBTA\n\nYou two clearly have different ideas on what is considered proper planning.

It just might be something to look into.", "ESH, not for going on your own trip, but for doing so as a means of punishing your partner. You're just not compatible. Some people take years to plan trips, others prefer to book the flights and hotel and decide the rest when they get there.

You should have quietly planned your own trip, knowing he was never going to get his ass in gear. Then, when it comes to the day of your vacation, I'd have skipped gleefully to the airport and let him stew in the knowledge that you chose to not micromanage him, but in doing so he proved you right as he would now be sat on his ass at home. \n\nMaybe he's annoyed that you won't just leave him to it and maybe he does have stuff planned but wants to surprise you. It can be annoying to have someone not trust you to do something and then take over so I would say there could be an argument for a YTA here. \n\nBut I'm sticking with NTA because we both know that your fianc\u00e9 couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery.", "You gave him ONE job.

It's not about just him not planning things, it's him not taking into consideration what you consider important.", "NTA.  But think really hard about what you want to do about this.  And you also need to examine your situation and determine if this something he's doing deliberately so that he won't have to, because \"you're so good at it...and look what happened when I tried to do it!\"  Is he really that scatterbrained (and does it apply to his work?  his friends?  stuff he wants to do on his own, or just stuff with you?),  or is he trying to manipulate you into doing the emotional labor?", "NTA. \n\nFirst, I can actually totally understand that your partner is otherwise amazing, and that this issue is remarkably annoying. \n\nSecond, of course he likes going on trips but doesn't want to be responsible for the planning- what a nice way to go through life!\n\nThird, this isn't just a vacation, it is also your birthday and I imagine other \"fun\" or celebratory stuff where you want a partner who can plan for you- like a birthday- and also with you, like a vacation. Being disappointed is not fun, nor is doing all the work for the fun stuff. \n\nFinally, I think you are right to call it out and go alone. You have been at this for years and you even let him off the hook last year and already talked to him about this trip, and not only has he not done stuff but thinks the next step is for YOU to plan the whole trip and take him too. He needs to see that this is a serious issue- in an otherwise good relationship- and that he can't just pass the buck and expect no consequences. \n\nSo here is where it gets tricky. You have now issued an ultimatum and he is upset about it, so now is the time to talk again. If you go without him, there will be a lot of resentment on his end, and if you go with him or don't go at all, there will be resentment on his end; you two are in a place where your otherwise good relationship might not recover, so time to talk!\n\nBe clear with him: You don't want to force him to do stuff he doesn't want to do, but if he wants to do fun things, he has to be an adult and help with the planning. That it sucks to have to be the adult all the time and follow up about plans, nag about getting stuff done, and often times realizing if you don't do it, it won't get done. That's not a partnership. And then, knowing that you are likely to be let down on special occasions because he won't plan, makes you sad and can ruin events before they happen because you worry it won't get done. So, is he willing to be a partner and an adult, and like millions of us every day, do the stuff that isn't fun so that we can have fun? How great would it be to go through life saying \"I want this\" and then just having others plan it so it will happen.

You guys could make a fun evening planning the trip.", "NTA. However, people often have different vacation styles. It seems as though you need solid plans. I can't relax until everything is planned; whereas, my partner would be fine showing up & finding a motel when we get there. He's not very picky about accommodations either.

Well it was a disaster and exhausting due to poor planning. If having a conversation with him about how you want valuable experiences in your life then there is an underlying issue here. Either he may be depressed / burned out (I was and its a struggle to get excited about moments) or just simply is a person who doesn't give a eff. \n\nEither way, see how this trip goes for you.

He hasn't booked the flights, reserved restaurants, booked or found things to do, etc. Two weeks ago I decided to check on him regarding it and found out he hadn't even reserved a hotel room (which he has recently done). I've told him if the week the trip is planned for rolls in and he hasn't booked the tickets, I'll be taking my own personal trip without him for the entirety of the planned dates to location A. He's telling me that would be selfish and inconsiderate of me. He enjoys traveling as much as I do and other than planning, he's perfect in every aspect and I love him to death.\n\nSo basically, WIBTA for going on a trip without my fiance because he failed to plan a trip he was responsible for?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You seem pretty good at it. But you took over the little he did get planned and vetoed his one selection. I really doubt this is a one off thing. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t mean to, but it probably feels like criticism and he probably already feels bad enough about having trouble with this (I doubt his lack of planning is isolated to the relationship, he probably struggles in all areas of life and likely has his whole life). So it probably feels like kicking a beaten dog to him. Being treated like that, you end up giving him because you feel like whether you try or not, you\u2019re still going to fail, so why bother. \n\nIf you really want him to help out with planning, be kind and patient with him. Work on making the plan together. Explain the steps you take.

I feel for you. Absolutely NTA in my opinion. I had a trip with a friend overseas.

She maybe gave me one comment in the eight months we were planning the trip. When time came for the trip, she kept complaining about all the stuff we were doing. Where we were going, where we were staying. She said she had wanted a different vibe for the vacation. All info which would have been useful in the prior 8 months when I was the only one actually planning anything! It was extremely annoying. IMHO, if he can\u2019t be bothered to plan, then you should absolutely plan your own vacation to where you want to go. If he doesn\u2019t want to go there, he can stay home and kick rocks. That\u2019s what he gets for asking you to let him plan a vacation and then failing at the very basics of it. If he wants to plan a vacation, then he should do that.

Mainly for this trip, I hope that he will understand the importance of getting things arranged and the consequences of last-minute planning. He knows I'm leaning towards visiting another city (NYC due to some exhibits I didn't get to see for my birthday in March) if he doesn't book the flights. He doesn't like NYC as much as I do and doesn't plan on tagging along if I go, which is fine with me.

Like I\u2019m sorry, but booking flights isn\u2019t that difficult? Booking a hotel isn\u2019t either. It sounds like he was asked to do basic stuff for their trip and couldn\u2019t be bothered. If it\u2019s a memory thing, use post its, calendar appointments to do the thing, whatever he needs to do to make himself remember. This sounds to me like he can\u2019t be bothered and expects OP to take on the mental load of the trip they wanted to do together. If that\u2019s what is happening, I think OP is perfectly reasonable to plan their own trip since if he really cared about it, he could put minimum effort into the basic tasks he was supposed to do. Like if OP is expecting him to have elaborate plans then no, that\u2019s not ever going to happen from this guy, but this sounds like very basic stuff that he just doesn\u2019t care enough to do.", "He said he wants to be able to fully take control of a trip because in the past I've always done it and he said he felt like his thoughts/opinions weren't considered.

When we arrived, I was way overdressed and we left to go to another spot that I enjoyed. It was a small step up and I let him know I appreciated the gesture and that we could visit on another day.", "\\~2 years ago he mentioned that he'd want to choose a place to visit when COVID was easing up. We were talking about something (I don't remember) but he said that I always planned the trips and chose places to go and never gave him the opportunity to do so or considered the places he was interested in.   \nI fully disagreed with him as we've been traveling together since our early 20s and whenever I tried to involve him in planning, he drags his feet until the date to leave is about 2 months out; thus why we came up with the agreement of choosing who would be responsible for what with a deadline.\n\nI'd also like to add that due to our schedules, I usually try to keep things organized due to working two jobs, a 9-5 and a part-time role, so I've always stressed to him about having trips organized where it's convenient for both of our schedules.", "I know, and although I'm content with doing all the planning personally, I dislike how he attempts to try and provide input or say he can handle the tasks associated with it.

When I've planned entire trips (which I don't mind at all, but would love input) he fully enjoys it and does find small things for us to do. The whole thing about me not considering his opinions came out from a huge argument and I was honestly surprised to hear it myself because he never gave much attention to planning the trips, thus why I'm feeling anxious and frustrated with this one because he's put very little into planning it and the date is around the corner.", "Last anniversary, we agreed that he would be responsible for choosing a destination, and I would be responsible for finding the plane tickets.

He will leave you", "After our last huge argument about two years ago, he'd say he would step up and be more involved in planning.

Obviously not if a relationship can end due to one negative trait like planning.", "LOL! \n\nAs someone who has never lived in a hurricane zone and only has very limited vacation time, I\u2019m not going to roll that dice and possibly lose money. I have friends who have had vacations massively altered or outright canceled due to a forecasted tropical storm or hurricane. Couple that personal experience with my tendency to see the glass as half empty, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019d book a holiday in an area during Hurricane season. I\u2019d go there at another time of the year, but hurricane season is a logical issue to raise for the OP. \n\nAnd yes, I know that anything can happen anywhere at any time (why I always buy trip insurance), but risk assessment is a real thing.", "For further context (lol?) my family is from and lives on another island not too far from the one the trip is planned for. Whenever planning to visit or even visiting in the later months, it's literally a hit or miss to experience tropical/rainy weather. This was not something that I'd want to experience on an anniversary and it's important to note that he also agreed.", "I agree with you 100%. There\u2019s no way that he\u2019s perfect in every other way because this is a big ongoing issue. He procrastinates talking to her about planning the trip. He doesn\u2019t procrastinate at other times? He\u2019s told her he wants to plan this trip because she always plans the others without his input. He doesn\u2019t tell her this regarding finding a place to live together? Maybe household projects? \n\nOP, this is only going to get worse. What if you have kids? Don\u2019t expect much help but do expect to be criticized. Buying a house? Are you going to wait on his input finally narrow it down to two and then be criticized for that? What he\u2019s doing points to a bigger issue.", "And would you call your partner an idiot for doing so, like OP has done?\n\n\"I have friends who have had vacations massively altered or outright canceled due to a forecasted tropical storm or hurricane.\"\n\nAnother anecdote, like mine, but not a statistic.", "I haven't actually considered his involvement in the more prominent/primary life events. Definitely something to think about, thank you.", "No, I hope I wouldn\u2019t call him an idiot. Fair point. But I\u2019ll also say that one of the reasons I\u2019m divorced is because my ex exhibited some of these same behaviors. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right about our personal anecdotes, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right to \u201ccriticize\u201d her for not wanting to travel to a specific location during hurricane season. Maybe she and her fianc\u00e9 did actually agree that this location wasn\u2019t good for them that time of year, but you implied that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cYou \u2018agreed\u2019 on this. After you blasted him for it.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sure the OP could\u2019ve handled all of this better; however, it seems that her fianc\u00e9 could\u2019ve, too. He\u2019s procrastinated, criticized, etc. She has limited vacation time and nothing is done even after he said he wanted to plan it, actually insisting on planning it. \n\nThe more I think about it, it sounds like he\u2019s set up the scenario where she\u2019s the nag and is criticized for it. Yeah, if I were her, I\u2019d go on my own trip if it came to that. But that\u2019s after I dumped him.", ">But I\u2019ll also say that one of the reasons I\u2019m divorced is because my ex exhibited some of these same behaviors.\n\nOh, I agree OP's SO is an AH.  I called them both out.  Putting all of the work on her is an AH move and they're probably not compatible.  But I'm also reading between the lines and betting her belittling him is NOT an isolated incident.  And I would do the same that he's doing in retaliation.", "I agree with you. They probably shouldn\u2019t be engaged at this point, at least until they work out some major issues."]}
