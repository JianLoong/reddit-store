In total, we are expecting 15 people for dinner, but 6 of them are staying with us for a couple nights.  Two of my wife's family members are in recovery for alcoholism.  Her uncle has been sober for almost 6 years.  But one of her cousins from a different uncle has only recently started his recovery.  He was in treatment for a couple months and finished that maybe 2-3 months ago.  Everything I've heard is that he's doing much better and hasn't had any setbacks.  Her cousin and his mom are 2 of the people staying with us.\n\nMy wife's mom and aunt (cousin's mom) told my wife that we should make sure there is no alcohol for Thanksgiving.  Not asked, told.  My wife apparently agreed without discussing it with me.  She only told me about this plan this past weekend.  We were out shopping and stopped at a liquor store and I mentioned getting a few things for Thanksgiving.  She said she \"forgot\" to tell me, but we are having an alcohol-free Thanksgiving.  \n\nWhen I asked why, she explained about her family members in recovery and that her mom and aunt think we should do this out of \"solidarity\" with them.  I told her that I understand that, but I also don't necessarily agree with forcing everyone else to change for 2 people.  She said that I can make this sacrifice for a few days and that it's not that big of a deal.  \n\nI am the one who is going to be doing most of the cooking.  Neither my wife nor anyone in her family is great in the kitchen. My wife is OK as a sous chef if I need her to be, but that's about it.  When I cook, I like to enjoy a glass of wine, a beer, or a cocktail.  Especially if I'm going to be in the kitchen for a long time cooking a huge meal for over a dozen people.  \n\nI told her that if she wants me to cook an entire Thanksgiving dinner for her family, then I should be able to dictate how I cook that meal, including having a drink while I do it.  She thinks that her request for a dry Thanksgiving is entirely reasonable and that I'm making this into a big deal when it doesn't have to be.  \n\nIt's not like I'm going to start drinking at 9am, nor do I intend on getting drunk.  But I'm going to be spending a lot of hours in the kitchen and I want to be able to cook the way I enjoy cooking.  I would even be ok without having a drink with dinner, but this compromise is not acceptable to my wife. It has to be 100% alcohol free.  \n\nI understand wanting to make sure that her family members feel comfortable, especially her cousin since this is so new for him.  But this is my house too and I'm going to be the one doing the majority of the heavy lifting.  I don't feel like me having a few drinks in my own home while I'm cooking a huge meal is too much to ask.\n\nYes, I know it's only a few days and not drinking during that time is not going to kill me.  But I also feel like if I'm going to be spending hours cooking for these people, me having a few drinks would be a reasonable concession.", "created_utc": 1668628554, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yx48sc/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_an_alcoholfree/", "score": 5831, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A couple of her family members are in recovery for alcoholism and my wife agreed to have a dry Thanksgiving without talking to me about it.  I am going to be doing the cooking and I like to have a drink while I cook, especially a large meal.  But my wife is insisting that it be a 100% dry Thanksgiving.

There is no reason why you can\u2019t have a few drinks while you cook.  And the person in recovery will never know.  Enjoy your thanksgiving!", "I have a family member who is in recovery and they have explicitly stated that changing our behaviors to accommodate her (or what WE perceive as accommodating her) actually makes her feel more anxious. She drank to self medicate the anxiety disorder. I think first of all, you need to see what these recovering addicts want first and foremost.\n\nSecondly, part of the struggle of addiction is dealing with exposure in a healthy way. It\u2019s not practical or even helpful to remove all traces of an addict\u2019s substance of choice from every scenario. Coping and learning to steer clear is something that must be learned. I understand that the person is in recent recovery, so that Skews my viewpoint a bit on this. But really, a person in recovery will need to learn how to navigate these normal everyday temptations. Don\u2019t be an AH and OFFER alcohol, of course. But I think keeping the atmosphere as normal as possible will be most helpful to the family members who are in recovery. \n\nSo NTA, your wife and mother in law are well-meaning, but this isn\u2019t the right course of action. I strongly encourage that all of you read some resources that are available (there\u2019s tons online) to family members of addicts so that they can be as supportive as possible to their loved ones.", "NTA and it\u2019s a completely unreasonable request.  \nIf the 2 alcoholics are so fragile in their recovery then perhaps a big family thanksgiving isn\u2019t the best idea for them.   They are solely responsible for their own sobriety.   No one is obligated to modify their behavior around them.", "INFO: Are the recovering alcoholics even aware of this \"request\" from MIL and your wife's aunt? Or are they just virtue signaling? It seems like something that could be super embarrassing or uncomfortable for them if people are making demands on their behalf and they don't even know. Ultimately, it should be between the relatives in recovery, and you AND your wife. Nobody else should have a say. While MIL and aunt seem to have good intentions, they also seem a bit skewed.", "1. Being a recovering alcoholic includes learning how to say no and not impact other people with your addictions.\n2. You have every right to drink in your own home if you want to. \n3. They have every right to not attend if that is a problem for them.\n4. If your wife's relatives are so weak-willed that seeing you having a glass of wine while cooking will spin them back into substance abuse, then they aren't actually in recovery.\n\nNTA, this is unreasonable. But, that said, if you choose to die on this hill it's going to make your life super rough for a while. Pick your battles carefully. I would fight this, not for the drink but for the principal of other people policing what I can do in my own home. That's a big  red flag for me.", "NTA... if you cant even SEE a drink across a room youre not \"recovered\" yet.", "NTA.  Recovering alcoholic here.  One of our (AA) principles is that it is not our job to dictate or judge or try to control others, especially \"normies\" (normies meaning normal non-alcoholic drinkers).  It is our job manage ourselves and ourselves only.  My wife is a normie, I've never once asked her to change any of her habits or consumption choices to show \"solidarity\" with me.  That's complete nonsense.  You have every right to enjoy a drink in your house while cooking Thanksgiving dinner, and someone who is in a healthy recovery wouldn't ask you to change that.  Tell them I said to talk to their sponsor and leave you alone.", "NTA.  My husband has several family members in recovery but never have they asked us to have a dry Thanksgiving / Christmas.  So not only are they staying with you, you can\u2019t even relax with a glass of wine while preparing dinner or a beer during football?  How did your wife think this was ok?", "NTA you don\u2019t have to chance your entire holiday plan over two people. It\u2019s not something they have to partake in.", "NTA - People should stop running other people's homes. If they don't like it, they can regroup elsewhere. I'm the friend who will stay sober with sober friends, but I will not force others or even suggest others do the same.", "NTA. Your compromise (you enjoy a drink in the kitchen while the guests wait elsewhere) is way more generous than others would be. \n\nWhat are her family members going to do if they hear you\u2019re having wine in the kitchen? Will they  barge in and grab it out of your hands?\n\nHave her cousin come late \u2014 after all the cooking is done. That will allow you to have a drink and then hide it all away before the cousin arrives.", "NTA - I am in recovery for addiction. Doesn\u2019t mean I make everyone else\u2019s lives an inconvenience. They\u2019ll have to learn to be around alcohol like everyone else and resist temptation.", "NTA.", "Poor your beer into a big gulp and keep on chugging IMO. NTA.", "I am wondering if anybody has bothered to talk to the cousin in all of this. I have several loved ones in various stages of sobriety.  And they all have varying levels of comfort being around alcohol. I also have a loved one who literally drank himself to death.  The cousin may not want to participate in the family holiday, with all the drama that goes along with that, Even if it is alcohol free", "NTA,  \n\n\nBut I would tell my wife : \"If I can't have my drink while cooking for your entire family better you get another person to cook.\"  \n\n\nPart of the recovery is learning to say NO and if they do not learn this they will never recover fully.", "NTA and I HIGHLY doubt your wife \"forgot\" to tell you.", "NTA. When my mom was first recovering as an alcoholic she went to parties with alcohol and just knew she needed to say no. He can\u2019t be babied forever. Temptation exist and you gave a perfect compromise. Your wife shouldn\u2019t have agreed without talking to you", "NTA, especially since the request doesn't come from the person actually affected but from their mom. If I were you, I would reach out to the cousin on the phone and have a conversation. Tell him how you want him to feel welcome and explain the usual alcohol situation (not a heavy drinking event, etc), ask for what he needs to be comfortable. Some common things would be to not be offered alcohol, to not have it too easily accessible/in view (like he might tell you he gets cravings at night and would prefer if it's not right next to the juice in the fridge), to make sure no one makes a big deal about it, etc. Visiting you for several days is likely a much more stressful situation than the actual meal so ask if there's anything you can do to ease that a bit. Tell him you're a safe person to talk to and that you'll respect his privacy.", "NTA, your wife won\u2019t even compromise by letting you put a drink in a yeti cup or something to drink while you cook? The family members wouldn\u2019t have to know it\u2019s alcohol and everyone else can stay dry if they choose", "NTA, and FYI for TG cooking having a little vino at 9AM happens (and not just to drunks or lushes, either). It's totally unreasonable and these family members (soo glad they got sober!!) must understand that they world won't change for their sobriety.", "NTA. Your wife is an A H for agreeing without running it by you. You are a partnership, not a dictatorship. This is why I\u2019m voting NTA. \n\nMy family is full of alcoholics, and I understand the holiday season is a triggering time for many. I think your compromise of only drinking in the kitchen and not at the table was great. I share your love of cooking with a glass of wine, so I\u2019m sympathetic to both sides.", "NTA have her and her family cook. If you can\u2019t cook on your terms she can and everyone can have an awful or mediocre dinner", "NTA\n\nI got addicted to various stupid shit in my younger chaos filled years (thankfully not serious drugs or alcohol) and I made the changes to cut that shit out , people including my partner still enjoy smoking , gambling around me (I told them it was fine and meant it so don't rag on them ) but MY PROBLEM IS MY PROBLEM I find it highly disrespectful to expect people to tiptoe around MY PROBLEM and change their behaviour to make shit easier for me. I have been \"clean\" for over 15 years now and the compulsion is still there so they either deal with it or hide away from every potential trigger (good luck with alcohol it's everywhere)", "NTA. If they don't want alcohol at the table while the family is eating that's understandable. But you having a drink in your kitchen while cooking for everyone should be a non-issue. At any rate, it's not your responsibility to manage their recovery. If they can't help themselves but to grab any stray drink they see then they aren't ready for social gatherings.", "NTA because she didn\u2019t discuss this with you beforehand and she is unwilling to compromise.  You are already hosting and cooking for her family which is a lot. The issue here is the unilateral decision making. An alcohol free thanksgiving to support a recovering family member is a kind thing to do, but dictating how someone else hosts a holiday is not. A lot of people are going to be focused on the alcohol aspect here, but I think the issue is others telling you how you host when you are the one doing the lions share of the work and not considering your opinion at all.", "NTA - unfortunately it doesn\u2019t sound like the rest of her family is going to Alanon - if they were, they would realize that they are trying to control the alcoholics, and the first step in Alanon is acknowledging that THEY are powerless over alcohol. They think they are helping, but they are not", "NTA. Your wife made two errors. First, she doesn't get to dictate terms to you in your own home. Period. Second, if you're cooking for everyone, you get to do what makes you happiest/most comfortable. If that means you want to enjoy an adult beverage or three, you have that privilege. (If your wife doesn't like your proposal, your aunt can take over hosting duties.)\n\nYou were kind (and correct) to offer to refrain from drinking at the table in front of someone who has so recently entered recovery. That's the reasonable compromise. If your wife's cousin and uncle are still so triggered that they can't even tolerate you enjoying a cocktail while cooking, then they're not ready to interact with others.", "NTA. The ability to be in the same space with alcohol but not drink it is part of the process.", "NTA - You \"forgot\" to tell her she's cooking Thanksgiving dinner this year.", "NTA.\n\nEverything I've heard about people in recovery is that a big part is learning how to be around it.   It's fair to ASK, but not fair to demand.  Your wife shouldn't have agreed without discussing it with you. \n\nAnd TBH, I don't know that I'd ever want to go to a dry thanksgiving with my extended family.", "My grandparents were both recovering alcoholics. I spent my whole life growing up at AA meetings, so I pretty much have heard it all, and talked to so many recovering alcoholics to know what I am talking about.\n\nThe one thing they all said was if I put myself in a situation to be around alcohol it is up to me to not drink, it is not up to anyone else to change their lives to suit me, or accomodate me.\n\nMy husband drinks beer, my grandparents knew this, We lived with them several times, for several reasons, most of them were to take care of them because of medical reasons. My husband always respected them and them being recovering alcoholics, would never drink in front of them or bring it in their home. My grandparents asked why and he told them. They told him that he had their permission , because they know they don't have to pick that drink up , and they can control themselves.\n\nThey also said that if they are visiting someone elses home they would never expect them to not have alcohol in their home, or expect them to go without. \n\nEveryone expecting you to not drink in your own home is wrong. If the cousin can't handle it in a family get together, then how is he going to be able to handle it in a restaurant or sporting event, or other get together or places. They are not helping him , he needs to be able to put himself in situations to help him make better choices, and test his strength, and the best place to do it is with family who can help him control the urge. Instead of in public and cause a scene", "NTA, while I don\u2019t drink alcohol, there\u2019s no way I can make it through thanksgiving with family sober. \n\nAlso a huge part of recovery is learning to say no when the thing you crave is right in front of you.", "NTA. I am all for making people feel comfortable as a guest, but as several people pointed out, recovery is the addict/alcoholic's responsibility. You can't hold their hand as they live life and we aren't getting rid of alcohol in the world. That's what his sponsor is for anyway. And if he can't be around alcohol - he should be the one to say his boundaries and what he can/can't handle and take it from there himself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut to keep the peace, I'd say just be subtle and drink out of a travel mug or something.", "NTA \n\nIf the cousin is that fragile in his recovery, they need to make other plans.  Holidays are a huge trigger for a lot of reasons and a lot of people.  Your drinking while cooking should not affect other people.  They are responsible for themselves.  \n\nAlso - \u201csolidarity\u201d ?!???\nSo if I\u2019m a vegan, we are now all vegan.  If I have gluten issues, we all have gluten issues. If I am lactose intolerant, now we all must stand together and have no dairy.  \n\nComing from a long line of alcoholics, I can tell you there is no solidarity.  The alcoholic will find a way to drink even if you have a \u201cdry thanksgiving\u201d if that is what they choose to do.  \n\nEnjoy your wine!", "NTA\n\n> we are having an alcohol-free Thanksgiving.\n\n\"Maybe you are, but I'm not\".  This wasn't discussed with you, nor did you agree to it.\n\nMost people need a stiff drink or two to get THROUGH thanksgiving dinner with family! /s", "*She thinks that her request for a dry Thanksgiving is entirely reasonable and that I'm making this into a big deal when it doesn't have to be.*\n\nThat's just it.  It's not a request\n\nShe already said it was going to be dry so that makes YOU the bad guy if you push back\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are an adult in your own home and it\u2019s ok for you to have a few drinks there! I know the prohibitionists on this sub are going to come out in full force claiming that anyone who wants to have a couple drinks at home on a holiday has a drinking problem, but in reality what you\u2019re doing is perfectly normal. If any of your wife\u2019s family have a problem with you having a drink in your own home then they can just go elsewhere.", "NTA - has anyone asked the cousin what he\u2019s comfortable with? Your wife, MIL and aunt are assuming that the uncle and cousin want a dry Thanksgiving, but the reality is that they don\u2019t know because they haven\u2019t asked and/or assumed.", "NTA - if the request came from one of the people in recovery, it\u2019d be different. But for other people to decide what they can handle, and expect everyone to follow that direction is both patronizing to those in recovery and disrespectful to the host (ie OP)", "NTA because there was no discussion. No alcohol during dinner is fine but a person in recovery has responsibility too. Either way she just should have talked to you before agreeing.", "NTA \n\nTheir sobriety is for them to manage and if they\u2019re not comfortable at social events where alcohol is present then they don\u2019t come.", "NTA \nTheir recovery is their responsibility, not yours.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been around the fellowships of AA an al-anon a lot as well as around people at all stages of recovery. There\u2019s a big difference in flouting alcohol, offering it, having it in every corner, taking shots, etc. than having a glass of wine or a beer on a holiday. \n\nIf a person drinks merely because they\u2019re near someone who is drinking, they\u2019re not ready to recover and they don\u2019t stand a chance in trying.

No!", "INFO:\n\nWhat's stopping you from covertly enjoying your own drink anyway in the privacy of the kitchen while you cook? If someone happens to pass by and ask just tell them you're having a juice or soda", "NTA. Part of recovery is learning how to be around others who are doing what you are in recovery for, and learning to accept it without getting triggered.", "This is squarely the responsibility of the alcoholic. I was married to one for years. His sobriety was and is his responsibility. Nothing I or anyone else did caused it, nothing I did could stop it, and nothing I do causes a relapse. The aunt and mom are terrified of them relapsing and are being helicopters flying ahead and getting alcohol out of the way to prevent a relapse. They need Al Anon to learn how to deal with their fears and how to best support an alcoholic.

Your house, my partner is in recovery and we have a dry house but would never expect or request someone else to have one. If it's too much for the person in recovery then perhaps they should sit this holiday out or find someone else's house to go to.

Keeps the oils and funk floating around in an active kitchen from getting into your drink, and keeps the contents of your cup private. No one else should be drinking from your cup. The event is being held in your home. Why is this an issue when you can have your own drink *and* keep the alcohol out of sight from recovering family? When we have events with either very religious or in recovery family around, my generation of our extended family just pulls out their reusable insulated cups and goes to the car bar. Unless someone is getting stupid and sloppy, no one that is sensitive to seeing alcohol ever has to encounter it. It's not secret, but it isn't in their faces, either. It works really well for us, so you may give it a go at your own family functions. \n\nDoesn't have to be a car, but we also enjoy sitting in the gate of an SUV catching up without very young or very old ears around to hear things they maybe shouldn't. We've done inside before, but all migrated outside to a lower person per sqft density as soon as our drinks were ready.

Their recovery is their responsibility, not yours.  \n\nMaybe offer a compromise if you feel inclined by offering to have everyone drink out of a cup/glass (not transparent) - so they won't necessarily KNOW who is or isn't drinking alcohol.  \n\nIMO - your hosting in your home = your rules.  It would be the same if they wanted to host Thanksgiving in their home.

Leave it up to her. Since she's making the decisions about Thanksgiving", "NTA. Be discrete and use a cup.", "NTA for sure. If there was a concern that the presence of alcohol would cause a relapse in any of the recoverees I'd change my mind, because yes obviously their recovery is their issue to deal with but as family, it shouldn't be too much of an ask to get some support. But, at least based on your wife's words, this is more for solidarity than for anything else. So then yeah it's pretty unreasonable for them to just EXPECT you to go along with it, even so far as trying to say you can't have a drink with cooking. Solidarity on that one btw, especially if you're the one doing most of the work. Kitchen rules are up to the chef IMO. And it's not like you'd be getting wasted either (though even if you were, still NTA).\n\nPersonally, I'd just drink while cooking anyway, because you shouldn't have to be 'allowed' to do something you never agreed to not doing in the first place.

I\u2019m curious if cousin wants it alcohol free or if mom is making a misguided request because of her own fears of relapse. I\u2019ve been in recovery for three years and for the first couple weeks, sure, I didn\u2019t want to be around alcohol or have it in my house. But now, I do not like being singled out as a person in recovery because my issues are my own. It\u2019s my job to put myself in smart situations or to maintain my sobriety with healthy coping mechanisms. His mom probably has her heart in the right place, but realistically having a big fuss made over being in recovery, especially when it\u2019s fresh, is very uncomfortable and draws too much attention to being in recovery. It can almost be triggering to have the attention and have to talk about why you\u2019re in recovery etc.", "NTA! You\u2019re cooking for a large group of people so you should be allowed to enjoy your time cooking however you seem fit. If your wife and her family don\u2019t like it, they can do all the cooking.

I'd personally ignore wife and drink away while cooking.", "I'm going to go with NTA.\n\nFirst, a guest made a demand to your wife for there to be no alcohol. Not a request, a demand. It is not the place of a guest to make demands. Next, your wife didn't even discuss it with you. It is your house as well. I get mad at my partner when he agrees to things that affect me without prior discussion. My house too, my input should be put in. Next, you're the one cooking. Cooking is a lot of work. You have a habit or a routine you like to abide by. It makes the activity more enjoyable for you. If your wife expects you to cook without any flexibility for you and what what would make the day more enjoyable, that's not fair.

In total, we are expecting 15 people for dinner, but 6 of them are staying with us for a couple nights.  Two of my wife's family members are in recovery for alcoholism.  Her uncle has been sober for almost 6 years.  But one of her cousins from a different uncle has only recently started his recovery.  He was in treatment for a couple months and finished that maybe 2-3 months ago.  Everything I've heard is that he's doing much better and hasn't had any setbacks.  Her cousin and his mom are 2 of the people staying with us.\n\nMy wife's mom and aunt (cousin's mom) told my wife that we should make sure there is no alcohol for Thanksgiving.  Not asked, told.  My wife apparently agreed without discussing it with me.  She only told me about this plan this past weekend.  We were out shopping and stopped at a liquor store and I mentioned getting a few things for Thanksgiving.  She said she \"forgot\" to tell me, but we are having an alcohol-free Thanksgiving.  \n\nWhen I asked why, she explained about her family members in recovery and that her mom and aunt think we should do this out of \"solidarity\" with them.  I told her that I understand that, but I also don't necessarily agree with forcing everyone else to change for 2 people.  She said that I can make this sacrifice for a few days and that it's not that big of a deal.  \n\nI am the one who is going to be doing most of the cooking.  Neither my wife nor anyone in her family is great in the kitchen. My wife is OK as a sous chef if I need her to be, but that's about it.  When I cook, I like to enjoy a glass of wine, a beer, or a cocktail.  Especially if I'm going to be in the kitchen for a long time cooking a huge meal for over a dozen people.  \n\nI told her that if she wants me to cook an entire Thanksgiving dinner for her family, then I should be able to dictate how I cook that meal, including having a drink while I do it.  She thinks that her request for a dry Thanksgiving is entirely reasonable and that I'm making this into a big deal when it doesn't have to be.  \n\nIt's not like I'm going to start drinking at 9am, nor do I intend on getting drunk.  But I'm going to be spending a lot of hours in the kitchen and I want to be able to cook the way I enjoy cooking.  I would even be ok without having a drink with dinner, but this compromise is not acceptable to my wife. It has to be 100% alcohol free.  \n\nI understand wanting to make sure that her family members feel comfortable, especially her cousin since this is so new for him.  But this is my house too and I'm going to be the one doing the majority of the heavy lifting.  I don't feel like me having a few drinks in my own home while I'm cooking a huge meal is too much to ask.\n\nYes, I know it's only a few days and not drinking during that time is not going to kill me.  But I also feel like if I'm going to be spending hours cooking for these people, me having a few drinks would be a reasonable concession.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There's some varying opinions on it being a problem if you can/Can't get through tasks without having a drink, but I'm not going to open that can of worms because cooking Thanksgiving dinner by yourself is a nightmare, especially when it sounds like you're not a fan of the task.  \n\nCan't there be a compromise of the sober people staying out of the kitchen while you are cooking, and the alcohol only stays in the kitchen?

That being said, I have a friend who is now sober, and she mentioned an incident the other way where someone dropped a bottle of wine on the store floor and it broke.

Unless the people in recovery are in the kitchen helping make dinner .,", "Serve beverages that you can add alcohol to discretely for yourself.

My family (except for my dad out of solidarity and seeing first hand what it did to my life) drinks around me. That\u2019s life, you can\u2019t avoid it forever. The only thing I would recommend is to be discrete. Don\u2019t get sloshed. Hide the alcohol if possible. The worst part about my family Thanksgiving (which is the day of my last relapse) is that they had loads of alcohol in every fridge and got sloshed all around me and poured drinks in front of me. Make it discrete and inaccessible to the family members and it should be fine. Your wife and her family should be willing to compromise, especially if you\u2019re not doing it openly but privately on your own time.", "NAH.

The people who, in an ideal world, shelter you with love and support? \n\nYou have every right to put your foot down and say you're not agreeing to stay sober while you cook, I guess.

In the early stages (like first 6 months ish) we never drank around him.  People in recovery cant expect to control the behaviours or temptations everywhere, so yeah, stay away from restaurants and game nights with acquaintances etc.  But I don't think it's too much to think that family can skip a drink for a couple of days to support you through the holidays in early stages (the proverbial 'you' I mean).", "I totally agree, but I almost feel like the recovering alcoholic family members might not even know the aunt is asking.

Has anyone asked them about this? I feel like a simple, \"Hey, without putting too much spotlight on your situation, I wanted to ask about something. It is common for me to have a glass of wine while cooking, and some enjoy a drink with dinner. Without knowing your current stage, is this something that could cause problems?\"\n\nAs the other commenter said, if they're truly in recovery, seeing someone have one drink shouldn't trigger them. Especially if nobody is trying to push one on them. \n\nPerhaps it's uncouth to ask directly, I'm not sure, but I feel like it could be belittling their progress to try to hide the world from them (slight exaggeration).", "hey congrats from a stranger in NY!!", "Not even the actual dinner. OP said he wanted a drink IN THE KITCHEN while cooking. For a crowd. Cousin can just stay out of the kitchen if he is that worries.", "Maybe you're right. I'd speak for yourself though.", "Honestly, most of the time my cooking comes out better when I'm a lil stoned. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nETA: Uh oh, the narcs found me and I'm getting downvoted. \u2639\ufe0f", "That is a completely reasonable argument, and it should be a fair compromise to the wife. Drink while cooking, don't drink at the table or while across from them on the couch. That should be manageable for family members who are important to you or your wife. If someone couldn't even give up the drink for an hour or two at the dinner table, then perhaps AA should be in order for that person too, but it sounds like OP has no problem with that.", "Agreed. This is weird behaviour and sneaking it into alcohol free zones (like someone else\u2019s house) is disrespectful. I\u2019m a huge fan of alcohol but haven\u2019t hidden it like that since I was a teenager and it was illegal to drink. \n\nWhat if someone drinks from your cup by mistake? Or finds out what you\u2019ve been doing? It\u2019s hard to explain this behaviour without it coming across as if you have a problem. I don\u2019t see this ending well. \n\nIt\u2019s your own house, you should be able to drink if you want to. Don\u2019t sneak it in. Talk to the alcoholics themselves and say the meal can be alcohol free if they want but that you\u2019ll do as you please in your own home the rest of the time.", "Except that's not the case presented here. OP wants to drink during an activity (cooking) that doesn't include the cousin. The cousin will not have to be the odd one out or turn down booze that's on the table.", "Good lord. That makes no sense. Hiding your drinking is a sign of alcoholism, not a trigger. She\u2019s just throwing shit at the wall to see if it\u2019ll stick", "My nephew-in-law is in recovery. My sister (my niece\u2019s mom) always has alcohol available at gatherings. Two of her step-kids smoke weed while there sometimes (we are in California and it\u2019s legal). Not once has he demanded everyone stop drinking/toking. In fact, my sister usually has sparkling cider so he and their kids can have a \u201cdrink\u201d too.", "Agreed with all of this. No one can decide for someone else what and when triggers occur. They could happen randomly, even when you have years of sobriety.\n\nRecovering alcoholic here! Just wanted to put in my 2 cents. Nobody should have a say in this except you and the cousin.\n\nHas anyone even ASKED him/her directly if he minds it? When I got out of recovery, my family thought they were doing me a favor by hiding alcohol at big events. It was a nice thought but it was unwarranted and pretty dehumanizing. They just decided FOR ME what I should be feeling and what my triggers are.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be so complicated. Just reach out to this cousin and directly ask him if he minds. Im pretty sure he would just laugh and say \u201cgo ahead.\u201d \n\nHowever, if it IS a trigger for him, tell him what your intentions are and why you want to drink. I promise you he\u2019ll totally get it and decide for himself if it\u2019s comfortable coming over or not.\n\nLiterally NO ppl should ever have a say about someone else\u2019s recovery except maybe his sponsor.\n\nYour wife and family mean well, but they are treating him like a child and, having been in that situation myself, it\u2019s very demoralizing and humiliating.", "We did this one year in support of an uncle and he said later that it felt weird, like he was being pitied more than supported. He hadn\u2019t made the request, my mom and another uncle made the decision. It came from a good place, but they really should have just checked in with him.", "That's what I'm seeing. My family is like this and I hate it sooooo much. They scheme behind someone's back in the name of not hurting or upsetting them. The problem is they're boomers with hella trauma that will never be resolved because they won't fucking go to therapy. But that's no reason to accommodate their bullshit. \n\nOp, just ask the people in recovery what they need to get through this.

Holidays are too dramatic. I have a few days off. I don\u2019t want all the bs.", "You are exactly right. I am 5 months into recovery, and my partner still drinks in our home. I chose to get sober for myself. If he wants to get sober, that is his choice not mine. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t his wife suggest that cousin and Aunt hit up some AA meetings during the day, and only be there once dinner is ready?\nSounds like a good compromise to me.", "Or, just order a bunch of pizzas to be paid for by the overstepping busybodies while you head to your favorite bar \ud83d\ude01.", "I'm such a lightweight when it comes to weed that there is no \"lil stoned\" for me.

I will happily come eat and clean your kitchen and bring a nice bottle of wine also.\n\nAnd I will also sit in the kitchen with you and pour your drinks and shit talk whoever you want. Just to be able to get out of cooking, prep work and shopping for my thanksgiving dinner.", "Has anyone asked the person in recovery how they feel? They may very well be against this entire idea and find it embarrassing. It\u2019s controlling of the aunt to make this request and seriously overstepping boundaries. It sounds like aunt needs to check out an al-alon meeting and/or therapy.", "You shouldn't even be doing the cooking a compromise would be okay I won't drink but I won't cook either. I look forward to what you all come up with on thanksgiving.", "Thank you!  My mom would never consider going to Al-Anon because of the religious/spiritual parts of it.    I think if she knows a more sience-based alternative exists it MIGHT be easier for her to consider.", "SMART is for addicts though. They are asking for alternatives to al-anon, which is for family members or close friends of addicts. Are you confusing al-anon and AA?

I wouldn't be surprised if he's not expecting anything like this of you in the first place.\n\nFor all we know he's feeling perfectly fine about the event as-is, and his mother's just being a shit-disturber.", "Definitely talk to the cousin. It\u2019s one thing to make a request for your own support, even through someone else, and another thing for someone to decide you need support that you don\u2019t need.", "It feels like Aunt and MIL may be thinking they\u2019re doing the right thing but they\u2019re also subtly setting you up to be the fall guy if cousin breaks his sobriety in the future. \u201cOh, if only cousin didn\u2019t see /u/teatotalledaita drinking on Thanksgiving, he wouldn't have drank on NYE!\u201d\n\nI think you are being incredibly generous with your time, money and home. You\u2019re cooking thanksgiving for 17 people! You\u2019re letting 6 of them stay for days! It\u2019s probably your vacation too, I say you can do what you want in your own house. Honestly, if this is MIL and Aunt\u2019s hard line in the sand, they can host instead.", "If I were one of those guests, I would be totally steamed that I can't have a glass of red with my turkey because of someone else's addiction. Are we so sure the other guests will be so thrilled with the dry Thanksgiving?", "Or just drink out of an opaque travel mug.", "He doesn\u2019t want jack or rum, he wants some wine lol. He just needs to find an opaque glass or cup and put 1-3 glasses worth of wine in it for him to sip on. It\u2019s not as glamorous as glass, and if he\u2019s super into wine it\u2019s definitely gonna affect it cause wine glasses have a specific design for a reason, but imo that\u2019s the best compromise here. He\u2019s only been in recovery for a few months and while seeing someone with a glass might be fine for most recovering alcoholics, it clearly runs in their family and he might not be able to stop himself knowing there\u2019s alcohol in the house. It\u2019s not mandatory but it\u2019d be a nice thing to do and I think even the alcoholics here are forgetting or ignoring that. Everyone\u2019s different.", "This is pretty much so how it works for me. I cook for 10+, open a nice bottle of red at 4:30 (guests expected at 5 for cocktail/appetizer hour), and the first people through the door ask what they can do to help. \"Wine me and wash these prep dishes.\" I think everyone washes something before dinner (6), and at the end of the meal everyone puts their own dishes in the dishwasher and washes another dish or two before we sit down to dessert and convo (or CAH...always good when people agree to CAH!). If no one spends the night, I'm going to have to unload and reload the dishwasher (no dishwasher known to man holds semi-formal service for 10+) and wash a few cooking dishes, so it's the least they can do! (Back in the before times I would usually have a couple/few people that would spend the night to avoid drinking and driving (smart...friends are not drinking and driving now, the crowd is just a little smaller and lives closer by), and they would clean up the last of the cooking dishes, unload (but not fully put away because they couldn't figure out where things went and everyone knows I'm anal about where things are in my house) and reload the dishwasher and turn it on again, and make or order breakfast...I miss the before times...)", "There's Smart Recovery for Family and Friends\n\nhttps://www.smartrecovery.org/family/", "Yes!
