How easy would it be for them to get hold of spare parts or get repairs done whilst they are on their trip? *Because if I get the right impression about it being a classic, then parts might be an issue.

Then gets pissed when someone doesn\u2019t want to sacrifice the many miles and west and tear on their own vehicle? Definitely NTA.", "A car is far too big a thing to loan out casually.\n\nMy son had an accident in my car this year, and it was a write off.  We were without a car for a few months, as we had already ordered a new car and were waiting for it.  \n\nMy friend offered to let me borrow her car, and I said no.  I was very uncomfortable with borrowing something so valuable, and would have been terrified the whole time that something would happen to it.  And that's just with driving it locally.\n\nWe did end up borrowing a car from my parents, as our new car took longer than expected to arrive (whole other story), but I felt that was different.  It was my parents, not a friend.  Even then, I was so careful of it.", "NTA that is a huuuge ask for someone to use your car. \n\nLike wtf am I supposed to do while you are gone with my car asshole?

With a bunch of trash inside, and no gas. That was the one time I've loaned my vehicle to someone and it was a matter of her being able to make rent that month.\n\nThis person, I would be careful of the word \"friend\" here, wants you to loan them your only mode of transportation that is sentimentally important to you for free, for an indeterminate amount of time, and it sounds like you weren't even invited on the trip. Then they had the unmitigated gall to flip out when you declined that super great offer.\n\nNTA. They can rent a car.", "NTA - Tell them to rent a car.  How are they planning a trip without a car.   That\u2019s so entitled BS.    Don\u2019t feel bad about saying no.  I don\u2019t like anyone drive car period.
