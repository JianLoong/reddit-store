One thing is to have a generic dildo and  another is have a replica of your ex\u2019s dick laying around to be used when she wants. Thats not healthy for the relationship one bit. Some serious talks about it are needed.", "Absolutely NTA. Relationships are built on trust, respect, and understanding. While everyone has a past, it's crucial to be considerate about how remnants of that past might affect the present relationship. Her keeping and using a molded dildo of her ex isn't just a matter of a preferred toy; it's symbolic and a very tangible reminder of a past lover. This isn't about your insecurity; it's about respecting boundaries in a relationship.  \nLet's flip the script. Imagine if you had pictures of your ex-girlfriends that you regularly looked at during intimate moments. Even if you assured her they were just visuals and meant nothing, wouldn't that sting? It's less about the item and more about what it represents. Your feelings are valid, and it's not unreasonable to want that specific item gone. If she values the relationship, she should at least be willing to have an open conversation about why this hurts you and consider your feelings. Respect and empathy go both ways.", "NTA - she should ditch it but you should buy her a new one.", "NTA\nWonder how she would feel if you had a mild of your ex\u2019s whoo ha???", "NTA\n\nI wonder how she'd feel if you had a mold of your ex gf's vagina.", "> Anyway, I learned recently (a few months in) that my girlfriend had a mold made of Matt\u2019s penis which she keeps and uses as a dildo once in awhile.

Ask her if she would be cool with you having a sex tape with an ex that you kept around. And if she wouldn\u2019t be, how is that substantively different.", "NTA, jfc that is so inappropriate to keep. It's not like you're jealous of a vibrator. It's literally a mold of her ex's penis. It's also creepy as far as on his side too. I would really make this a hard boundary (no pun intended) and think about whether you can be in a relationship like this if that's a boundary she can't accept.", "This relationship isn\u2019t healthy   You already broke up once   I don\u2019t think the issues have been fixed at all", "I\u2019d dispose of her.", "NTA. That's very weird to keep a replica dildo of an ex. She really should get rid of it since it makes you uncomfortable. She could go buy a generic one that would get the job done just as well. Maybe buy her a new one- or make a mold of yours and give it to her \ud83d\ude1c and say onward and upward.", "NTA. She might not be lying, dicks really don\u2019t feel that different from one another so the custom dildo thing is more for the novelty than anything else. I doubt she\u2019s actively thinking of him when she uses it, and dildos are expensive to replace. But personally I wouldn\u2019t keep something like this and I think your boundary is very reasonable.", "NTA but neither is she. She is not obligated to follow your wishes. But this relationship may be doomed because you are insecure and she is dismissive.", "NTA, but if you keep harping on it you will be the AH. \n\nI\u2019m curious; do you ever think about your past lovers during solo time? Do you fantasize about being with porn stars when you\u2019re watching them to take care of business? If so, you have zero room to talk about this. \n\nI\u2019d also assume that having a dildo molded off his dick was his idea, not hers. So I wouldn\u2019t be insulted that she hasn\u2019t asked you to make one. \n\nThe way I see it, if she was only with him for his dick then as long as she still has this dildo for when you\u2019re not available, you don\u2019t have to worry about her going back to him to get the real thing. \n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned your issue with it. She\u2019s told you she disagrees. If it\u2019s a dealbreaker for you, then leave. If other than this the relationship is good, don\u2019t let her ex ruin it.", "NTA\n\nDoes she just use it when you\u2019re not around or does she use it when in bed with you?\n\nAlso, try gifting her a new dildo to replace the one she has. It might just be that she uses it because it happens to be the one she has.", "Lol silly to be threatened by her literally keeping her exes penis in a drawer?
