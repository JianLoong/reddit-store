We partly do the same degree so have half our lectures together. \n\nBecause of this, we\u2019ve always gone for lunch together before our lectures. It\u2019s not exactly a tradition but it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve done every week without fail. Recently, my friend has started dating someone who does the other half of his degree that I don\u2019t do. They\u2019ve been dating for only a couple of weeks but he\u2019s spending more and more time with her which I completely understand. \n\nLast week, I texted him asking if he wanted to get lunch before our lecture and he declined saying that he wanted to get lunch with his \u2018gf\u2019 (they\u2019re not technically labelling it but idk what else to call her) instead. It was slightly annoying but no biggie, I texted some other people on my course and went for lunch with them instead. \n\nBecause the lecture was after lunch, I sat with them during the lecture instead of with my normal friend. He got annoyed at this and called me petty for not sitting with him. He had to sit on his own as he doesn\u2019t know anyone else on the course. \n\nIt\u2019s been a week and he\u2019s still slightly mad at me, calling me petty just because he didn\u2019t want lunch with me. I don\u2019t think I did anything really that wrong because he cancelled on me first. AITA?\n\nEdit: I sat with the people I had lunch with because I thought it would be weird to just ditch them when I got to the lecture. He got to the lecture about ten minutes later and wanted me to come sit at the front with him and leave the other people.", "created_utc": 1677421234, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cic2x/aita_for_not_sitting_with_a_friend_in_a_lecture/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does he not recognize how insulting it would be for you to eat lunch with other fellow students than dump them as you go into the lecture?!", "NTA - your friend sounds extremely immature, like elementary school level.", "NTA - Apparently high school drama doesn't end in high school. You went to lunch with and then sat with a different group of friends....you're allowed to have friends outside friendships...he needs to get over it.", "NTA\n\nHe walked into the lecture late and still expected you to join him? In the front row, no less?\n\nHe's rude for disrupting class and entitled for expecting you to drop your lunch friends to dance attendance upon him.", "NTA.\n\nI can\u2018t believe this guy is already in college. He behaves like a little child.", "NTA. He\u2019s in college but acting as if he\u2019s in preschool. You\u2019re allowed to sit with other people. It only makes sense that you went together from lunch to the lecture and therefor are sitting together. If he wanted to sit with you he could\u2019ve approached you.", "NTA. you don't expect your friend to give you 100% of his undivided attention. it's unfair of him to expect the same. it seems to me that he's one of those people who put their friends last when they're dating someone, but then turn around and expect the same quality and demand of the friendship.\n\ni would express this to him. if he realizes the error of his ways, cool, and if this situation happens again, you can always invite him to sit with the group.", "NTA, presumably he knows how to get up and come over to sit with you - he could have even met your friends so he would now know more than just you at that lecture. He's being childish and petty and assuming the same of you.", "NTA he could have come sat with you or asked you to sit with him instead of just expecting you to sit with him. not automatically siting with him when you guys didn't come to the lecture together like you do after you guys have lunch does not make you the ah", "NTA, you set with the friends you were going to lunch with because it was easier and you guys could just head to lunch together.", "NTA. Have a conversation with him about it so it doesn't fester and run the friendship.\nHe's probably seeing it as an act of revenge for him declining lunch invitation so getting everything out in the open can let you and he say what needs to be said so you can move on.", "NTA -he could\u2019ve just sat beside you guys if it bothered him that much?", "NTA - he needs to grow up. You can sit with whomever you want. Him not knowing anyone else isn't your problem.", "Why didn't he sit with you and the new group?", "NTA", "NTA", "NAH.  Friends come and go and he has no reason to bitch or whine at you because you\u2019re not his gf.", "INFO: Sounds like he felt like your not sitting with him was about him and his declination of the lunch. Was it?", "\nNAH you have no obligation to sit next to your friend during the lecture, he however is also allowed to feel disappointed when he has to sit alone. Maybe save him a seat with you and your other friends next time?", "[deleted]", "Leaning toward ESH.  You said you invited him to lunch before the lecture and he declined. Then you said you went to lunch with your friends after the lecture. \n\nIf you went to lunch with your friends before the lecture, then it would make sense that you would sit together in the lecture, as you were arriving at the lecture hall together. \n\nBut if you went to lunch after, then I don\u2019t see why you didn\u2019t sit with your friend as normal and then meet up with your other friends outside of the lecture hall to proceed to lunch.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Childish.", "NTA\n\nIt would have been rude for you to get up and leave the people you were sitting with once he got to the lecture hall. Relationships change, and that's what is happening here. What is surprising, is the fact that he is the one changing the dynamics of the relationship, yet he is the one who seems to not be handling it very well.", "Nta", "Looks like he wants to gradually move away from you as his other relationship heats up but doesn\u2019t want you to fill in the empty space with other friends. \n\nMay be he has wanted you to be a romantic partner all  along and had hoped his new girlfriend would make you chase him.  Your easy agreement about not having lunch followed by evidence that you can easily fill his vacancy was him seeing you aren\u2019t hurting.", "NTA\n\nTHEY ARE NOT SIAMESE.\r  \n\r  \nIMPORTANT PART OF CONFERENCES IS NETWORKING.\r  \n\r  \nIF YOU DON'T KNOW OTHER PEOPLE YOU WILL NOT GROW WORKFORCE", "Info:  Was the lecture before lunch or after lunch? You say two different things.  This factors into my judgment.", "It honestly wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to ditch the people I had lunch with so I sat with them. He got there about ten minutes later so there wasn\u2019t really any seats nearby in the lecture.", "He\u2019s a big boy.

Definitely NTA! How can you sit with him when he's the one who arrived after? You were already there! Did he expect you to get up and go sit with him? That's ridiculous. \n\nHe can't have his cake and eat it too. Bails on lunch which is totally ok and then gets upset that you didn't get up and go sit with him.", "He can, he did! He was upset, I would be too. Would I have got upset with my friend in his shoes? Probably not but there\u2019s no harm in saying \u201chey I would have liked to have sat with you at the lecture anyway\u201d", "Did you have to ditch them to include him?", "She also wrote that invited her friend to lunch before the lecture.", "Then I think ESH. There was no reason for you to not sit in your normal seat next to him. I think you have a crush on this guy and that\u2019s why you were irritated that he didn\u2019t want to have lunch with you. And I think that\u2019s why you are so informed about the exact status of the relationship.", "Agreed. But I feel like he\u2019s turning it to be all about him (at the same time OP wrote this so is she making this about him\u2026?) I wonder if she really was a little petty to turn on a routine where they sit with each other. He just declined one lunch to be with a girlfriend. They\u2019re lucky I\u2019m in college and I eat lunch alone in my car", "And?\n\nShe asked her friend if he wanted to grab lunch before the lecture, he wanted to go with gf instead, so she asked other people to go to lunch.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t change the time the lecture starts, and in the next paragraph she writes that the lecture was after lunch.", "> no reason for you to not sit in your normal seat next to him\n\nlegit question: by this logic, why couldn't the guy have joined OP where she was sitting if normal seating didn't matter? since surfing to the edit it reads as if he got there after her.", "I remember being at university and feeling quite upset when my friends left me to sit alone at lunch. It\u2019s harder for some than others being away from home for the first time! I try and take these posts with a pinch of salt. It just sounds like he reasonably wanted lunch with his gf but still wanted to sit with his friend for the lecture", "Suggests that lunch was before lecture. That\u2019s the and.\u201d  \n\nLooks like just poor writing. She should\u2019ve said \u201clast week I texted him before our lecture and asked him if he wanted to get lunch.\u201c \n\nInstead, she said \u201cI texted him and asked if he wanted to get lunch before our lecture.\u201c", "Legit question: where did I say that normal seating didn\u2019t matter?\n\nPresumably, they chose those seats for a reason; perhaps to be closer to the front of the class. just because he got to the lecture late doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not going to sit in his normal seat if it is still available.", "Agreed. I\u2019m wondering how OP truly handled the situation with him. If she let any pettiness seep in her convos with him after the lecture.", "Lunch was before lecture", "You asked what the \u201cand\u201c was and I explained it to you. The sentence was poorly written.", "My friend is like this but we are 16 and still in highschool, so to see people older than us acting like her about the seating place is kinda funny", "I\u2019m genuinely curious, if we were the same gender would you still have said I had a crush on them?", "I\u2019m genuinely curious if you are aware that only 3.5% of Americans identify as gay?", "I mean I\u2019m not even American but I still don\u2019t really get your point? It\u2019s the fact that you\u2019ve automatically assumed because it\u2019s a guy and a girl that one of them has a crush", "Do you have a crush on him yes or no?", "NTA. I had a friend (now ex friend ) get angry at me because I didn\u2019t see her when she was walking through the hallway. She said accused me of being petty because she had other friends. I outlined the various friend groups I had and said I hadnt seen her. It was just weird. Does he normally make mountains out of mole hills?", "Didn't know you could get degrees in JUNIOR HIGH!
