Neither of us like kids, she has some health conditions that make pregnancy dangerous for her, so we're both pretty sure of it at this point. I got fixed at 25 to make sure, and I still get it checked yearly to make sure I'm barren down there.\n\nMy sister (32F) has two children (4F) (0M). She knew well before she even got pregnant that I'm not babysitter. Our house is not, nor will it ever be babyproof, and so it's probably better if she doesn't bring the kids over, which she doesn't. We never host any family events, since there are other family members with kids as well, but we don't complain when we're around others kids, we aren't neurotic about it.\n\nNow here's the issue, since my nephew was born around thanksgiving, my sister has understandably been stressed. Our parents both moved to Florida a few years ago for retirement, and none of the rest of the family lives close enough for them to visit regularly or vice-versa, my sister and I live about 10 minutes apart.\n\nSis calls me Friday sobbing, saying she's at the end of her rope and just needs to vent, which I let her. She tells me that she can't take it (She works part time and does all of the childcare, my BIL is deployed) and she needs a break. She asks if she can just come by with the kids for a little bit so she has some company. I reminded her we have a childfree house, and I'm not a babysitter. She offered to pay me to spend a night over there, not to help just for company, I refused, I'm not a therapist. \n\nIn the end I told her that her children aren't my concern, and that it isn't my fault she can't cut it. She hung up and blocked me. My wife thinks I was too blunt, but I don't want her to keep asking.\n\nEdit: Ok I get it, I'm the AH. I clearly came off as too harsh, despite not trying to do that. When/if my sister unblocks me I'll try to explain more gently why I don't feel it's my responsibility to help her parent her children.", "created_utc": 1675033649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10olngv/aita_for_not_allowing_my_niblings_in_my_childfree/", "score": 1060, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's a flashing neon warning sign, and all you care about is that she has kids? That's petty as hell, and honestly almost sounds envious/jealous. \n\nShe lives 10 minutes away from you. *Go and visit her*. Take a meal for the two of you and her oldest kid. Sit, chat for a bit, let her have grown up time. Maybe watch the kids for 5 minutes so she can shower.

I can understand not feeling comfortable having kids in your home, especially little ones, this just seems like the sort of thing that would be easily remedied by going to her instead, or making some arrangement so that the two of you can be together.\n\nThe poor lady sounds like she's deeply lonely and stressed. And while no, it isn't your FAULT or RESPONSIBILITY that she had children and is now struggling to drum up the energy and sanity to care for them entirely on her own, it sure would be kind of her brother to lend a supportive hand when she's in desperate need. Everyone needs help sometimes, and all they can do is ask and hope that their support network is available, and in a position to give it.\n\nIf you don't want to, fine. Don't. No one can make you.

Not only are you child-free but now you\u2019re sister-free too. She wasn\u2019t asking for you to take care of the kids. She made very clear by repeating she just needs company. Being essentially a single mom with NO adult interaction outside of work is *draining*. She offered to *pay you* for gods sake. And you *still said no*. She is clearly desperate for adult company and the chance to engage in adult conversation.

I think this is probably a troll as he's obviously unlikeable and using a bunch of trite reddit tropes as ways of saying things, but if he's real YTA.\n\nI don't just disagree with how he said it I disagree with the actual content of what he said. \n\nImagine you are a normal human being and love someone (like a family member). They are very stressed and call you sobbing saying they are at the end of their rope. They ask to come over so they aren't alone/have some company. And you'd . . .\n\n1) Say nope, they can't come over. Not beacuse you're busy, you just don't want to have to deal with keeping them company in their toughest time. You don't volunteer to go over to keep them company either, or meet somewhere, so it's not the \"childfree house\" excuse he just does not care a normal amount about others. I literally care more about acquaintance coworkers I see for a few minutes a couple times a week more then this guy does his family. In fact, I think I care more about strangers then he does his family. If I saw a women I didn't know holding a baby with a 4 year old and she was sobbing, saying she couldn't handle it, and could I not leave her alone if I was free I'd probably stay for at least a bit to figure out who she could talk to or something. Again, he tried nothing to help at all, didn't call his parents and ask his mom if she could visit and help out since OP can't be bothered to ever do himself, or anything. \n\n2) \"her children aren't my concern, and that it isn't my fault she can't cut it\". The message is \"I don't love you, I don't love your kids, I don't care about you, and also you are a failure as a parent for struggling and should feel bad.\" There is no way to say this that makes it good. We all have times in our life we feel sad or overwhelmed. Telling her this means she can't cut is completely unnecessary there's no way to say it that makes OP less of an asshole.\n\nWhether or not I wanted children I wouldn't want to be married to someone who was so callous to those he supposedly cared about. He gives off strong \"leaves your wife when she gets cancer\" vibes. It's a problem to be married to someone who only ever cares about his own problems and lacks love or empathy when it dosen't benefit him.", "God, my sister took her own life 8 years ago. What I would give for her to have called me and asked for help. The thought that someone can ignore that kind of call is mind boggling to me.", "of course not.

He doesn't like kids and doesn't want to interact with them in any way from the sound of it, since he refused to go to his depressed sister's house just to keep her company - and even if she PAID HIM.", "It just happened last week in Massachusetts. Three children were lost because of a mother's actions dealing with PPD. It's probably the most tragic story to come out in quite a long time for this area.", "Exactly. She didn\u2019t even ask him to babysit. I bet she\u2019s starved for adult conversation. He was cruel to her for no apparent reason.", "He even says she offered for him to go over there but he still said no.", "OP has made it clear in comments it\u2019s also not his job to fund his sister, so he wouldn\u2019t do any of these options.

My husband has severe anxiety and can\u2019t stand to be around kids for long periods of time, but he engages with our niblings in other ways. When they visited at Thanksgiving he even played with them for a while, and enjoyed himself. There were plenty of us around so he wasn\u2019t responsible for their care, but he is a kind person who loves his family and he wants them to know that he loves them. So while he may not be able to handle a whole night with their mom in crisis, he would absolutely order her a pizza and bring over some kids movies for the evening.

She knows she\u2019s not okay and needs help. \n\nI sincerely hope OP reads these comments and does some self reflection and reconsiders this stance because the consequences could be a matter of life and death.
