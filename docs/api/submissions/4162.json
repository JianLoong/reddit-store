{"id": 4162, "submission_id": "zez3x1", "title": "AITA for laughing in my mum\u2019s face and calling her deluded?", "selftext": "I (29F) have come out of a long term relationship after 7 years and 6 years of living together within the last 3 months. No kids and we weren\u2019t married. The breakup was relatively amicable and smooth. He let me stay in the house until I found another place to live and I managed to move out and into a new place after a month. The house is HIS house. Only his name and only he paid the mortgage. I never paid anything. I only contributed to bills, food shops and anything we bought together. I took the furniture items I bought myself which was just a desk, the dining table and some others and I\u2019m fine with that. I\u2019ve been sourcing some cheap furniture and stuff in this time. I\u2019ve had no contact with my ex since moving out as everything has been sorted so why would I?\n\nMy mum has been checking in on me. This is fine but it seems to be a lot more than normal. She is quite old fashioned and doesn\u2019t seem to understand how we had an amicable breakup. She thinks if we were fine for so long why did it end. We just grew apart. It\u2019s kinda annoying but I know she\u2019s doing it from a place of love. My parents were round at my flat the other night. I invited them round for dinner as I wanted to show them the progress I\u2019ve made with furniture. It\u2019s nowhere near fully furnished but I\u2019m getting there. Both commented that it\u2019s really pulling together and we enjoyed a nice meal. I thought the night was nice until my mum brought up my ex. (I should note my parents have not offered any financial help to me at all nor have I asked. I have been sourcing secondhand furniture from charity shops, social media marketplaces etc.)\n\nShe mentioned that I shouldn\u2019t be buying cheap things secondhand or having to do it over time. She thinks I\u2019m entitled to monetary compensation from my ex due to sharing a house with him. She would not shut up about it even after my dad and I protested and she was was annoying me.and eventually i laughed and called her deluded thinking I\u2019m entitled to money from a house I paid nothing towards.\n\nAnyway, my mum is pissed off with me. She says she is only looking out for me and that I \u2018deserve\u2019 something since I\u2019m now living on my own in a partly furnished flat. She says until I apologise for my \u2018outburst\u2019 she doesn\u2019t want to see me. Dad thinks we are both in the wrong and both need to apologise. My sister says Mum needs to stop being so involved in my business and stop harping on about the breakup. My best friend thinks mum is just trying to support me but is going the wrong way about it and that my reaction was valid but that maybe I should let it go.\n\nETA: my dad checks in on me, but it\u2019s a lot more relaxed and normal compared to my mother. He is quite relaxed and chill. They both love me very much but I do wish my mum could tone it down.\n\nETA 2: I\u2019m in England. \u2018Common law marriage\u2019 is not legally recognised here. I am not entitled to half of anything which I think some American commenters are mentioning. Why would I want a house that isn\u2019t even mine? Or anything else?\n\nETA 3: my mum knows we broke up due to growing apart. She knows I never co owned the house or paid towards it so I don\u2019t know why she thinks I\u2019m entitled to money.\n\nETA 4: please read my second eta. I am in the UK. There are no laws or legal rights for unmarried cohabitating couples unless you already have agreements in place such as a cohabitation agreement or if we jointly owned a mortgage. I also did not apply to stay in the property through a form of tenancy agreement.I literally do not want money and I\u2019m not owed money. Please understand that any non Uk commenters!

Don't apologize and take this time to create some distance from your mom. Avoid the getting back together talk that is sure to come. \n\nA clean break up is best. And it's nice to start fresh with things you can call your own. You'll get there! Good luck in this new chapter of your life!", "NTA but your best friend is right. Your mum is concerned for you, and that's where this is coming from, but she should have stopped when both you and your dad asked her to. I don't think you should apologise, as you're not sorry you said it, but you do need to let it go. Mums being annoying out of worry for their kids will carry on regardless of how old the kids are.", "NTA. Good for you for being so mature and level headed about this break up. I get why you were upset with her harping on the idea that your ex somehow owes you and by implication that you can't rebuild without him so you yelled the truth out of frustration. I agree with your friend and your sister but I think you feel the same after reading your replies. Your mom is ultimately feeling protective and you are having a much more mature viewpoint. Seriously you sound intelligent and awesome instead of sulking you are taking responsibility for your own happiness and rebuilding in your new place! Good luck it's his loss\ud83d\ude42", "NTA\n\nFirst off, put aside her dated thinking. All breakups don't need to happen because of abuse, disrespect, cheating and thoughts of marriage. It's the same with marriage sans the marriage proposals. Your parents can also amicably separate if there's no love between them, and you wouldn't mind. \n\nThat being said, calling her deluded probably wasn't the best way to tell her. What you can do right now is say to her, \"Mom, I'm sorry I called you deluded, but it was for the right reasons. I'm 29 and this kind of mothering is not good for me. I'm fine, and I will manage. Just know I love you, but please for the love of God don't think I'm entitled to have my ex financially compensate me, because he's already done so.\"\n\nMake sure that your dad's present while you say this, but don't ask for an apology. If she doesn't accept your apology or tries to do it again, you can stop talking to your mother because you were right all along.", "NTA\n\nYour mom crossed a line. You may have been too harsh, (in her opinion), but it seems that was the only way to get her to stop. Take a break away from each other for now and by the holidays,  explain to her that the subject of you and your ex is closed and you would appreciate if she never brought it up again.", "NTA your mom thought you were set for life and she didn't need to worry about your future. It's her issue thinking you need some type of security from your ex. It's going to take her a while to get over this and realize a woman can take care of herself and that it's fine, you're fine, everything is fine! \nBest wishes on your new life!", "NTA.  Your mom not being able to understand that the break up was amicable is one hundred percent not on you. You've told her and tried to make it clear to her what happened. She is deluded to think that your ex should pay you when there's literally nothing you should be paid for.", "~~INFO:~~\n\nDo you have anything like palimony in your area?\n\nI don't know who is actually correct here.\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But I think calling her deluded is a stretch. I mean she is not completely wrong. You did lived together for 6 years, the reason why you are not getting anything is because you were not married. If you were divorced, things would have been different. So maybe she is seeing it from that perspective?", "A little entitled that mum. As if living rent and mortgage free was something you need to be compensated for. Sometimes moms are like lawyers and can only argue for their side. She loves you but don't be afraid to tell her how you feel when she makes you upset", "NTA. Perhaps you could apologise to her mum for upsetting her but explain that her keep focusing on the breakup is bothering you and you would feel more supported by her just not mentioning it at all.", "NTA. Even if her initial comments were meant to be supportive, the fact that she ignored your response means that she's now being intrusive and unhelpful.", "NTA just for \"until you apologize for your outburst I don't want to see you.\" This is such a childish way of handling disagreements, and anyone who does this is the AH.", "NTA and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get downvoted but depending on the country you live in you are entitled to half. You were married you still contributed even if was to bills and furniture. Again depending on what country you live in.", "She\u2019s being overly concerned and I get she loves me but man it is frustrating. My dad is just very chill and I wish she was more like him.

I\u2019m not entitled to anything.", "You know you can choose when to engage with her, right? You\u2019re not obligated to speak to her every time she reaches out.  Start ignoring some (or all) of her calls. Text her instead of calling her, so the conversation goes at your pace rather than having to respond to everything in real time.

Heading up to edit my response.", "I wouldn't know either, but it doesn't look like she has any malicious intentions, she is just concerned and want you in the best situation.

No one is saying you have to though.", "I do not respond every time. When I don\u2019t she gets extra anxious so it\u2019s like wtf am I supposed to do", "Idk how the law works where you are but paying jointly to bills here  is not justification for receiving a monetary payout", "That's emotional manipulation.  Her anxiety is not your problem or fault.", "you are not responsible for her anxiety", "What everyone is saying.  Your mom is her own person and needs to manage her own emotions. You need to work on letting go of feeling responsible for managing her emotions.", "Being together here would make you a de facto couple if you\u2019ve been together for 7 years. This would entitle you to a division of property. Just explaining seeing as you asked. :)", "She\u2019s not a malicious person or manipulative or anything. She seems extra concerned that\u2019s all and idk why", "Well I\u2019m in the uk so the law is incredibly different here", "Yes you mentioned that. Good luck hope you work it out with your mum."]}
