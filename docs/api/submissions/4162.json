No kids and we weren\u2019t married. The breakup was relatively amicable and smooth. He let me stay in the house until I found another place to live and I managed to move out and into a new place after a month. The house is HIS house. Only his name and only he paid the mortgage. I never paid anything. I only contributed to bills, food shops and anything we bought together. I took the furniture items I bought myself which was just a desk, the dining table and some others and I\u2019m fine with that. I\u2019ve been sourcing some cheap furniture and stuff in this time. I\u2019ve had no contact with my ex since moving out as everything has been sorted so why would I?\n\nMy mum has been checking in on me. This is fine but it seems to be a lot more than normal. She is quite old fashioned and doesn\u2019t seem to understand how we had an amicable breakup. She thinks if we were fine for so long why did it end. We just grew apart. It\u2019s kinda annoying but I know she\u2019s doing it from a place of love. My parents were round at my flat the other night. I invited them round for dinner as I wanted to show them the progress I\u2019ve made with furniture. It\u2019s nowhere near fully furnished but I\u2019m getting there. Both commented that it\u2019s really pulling together and we enjoyed a nice meal. I thought the night was nice until my mum brought up my ex. (I should note my parents have not offered any financial help to me at all nor have I asked. I have been sourcing secondhand furniture from charity shops, social media marketplaces etc.)\n\nShe mentioned that I shouldn\u2019t be buying cheap things secondhand or having to do it over time. She thinks I\u2019m entitled to monetary compensation from my ex due to sharing a house with him. She would not shut up about it even after my dad and I protested and she was was annoying me.and eventually i laughed and called her deluded thinking I\u2019m entitled to money from a house I paid nothing towards.\n\nAnyway, my mum is pissed off with me. She says she is only looking out for me and that I \u2018deserve\u2019 something since I\u2019m now living on my own in a partly furnished flat. She says until I apologise for my \u2018outburst\u2019 she doesn\u2019t want to see me. Dad thinks we are both in the wrong and both need to apologise. My sister says Mum needs to stop being so involved in my business and stop harping on about the breakup. My best friend thinks mum is just trying to support me but is going the wrong way about it and that my reaction was valid but that maybe I should let it go.\n\nETA: my dad checks in on me, but it\u2019s a lot more relaxed and normal compared to my mother. He is quite relaxed and chill. They both love me very much but I do wish my mum could tone it down.\n\nETA 2: I\u2019m in England. \u2018Common law marriage\u2019 is not legally recognised here. I am not entitled to half of anything which I think some American commenters are mentioning. Why would I want a house that isn\u2019t even mine? Or anything else?\n\nETA 3: my mum knows we broke up due to growing apart. She knows I never co owned the house or paid towards it so I don\u2019t know why she thinks I\u2019m entitled to money.\n\nETA 4: please read my second eta. I am in the UK. There are no laws or legal rights for unmarried cohabitating couples unless you already have agreements in place such as a cohabitation agreement or if we jointly owned a mortgage. I also did not apply to stay in the property through a form of tenancy agreement.I literally do not want money and I\u2019m not owed money. Please understand that any non Uk commenters!

Just know I love you, but please for the love of God don't think I'm entitled to have my ex financially compensate me, because he's already done so.\"\n\nMake sure that your dad's present while you say this, but don't ask for an apology.

But I think calling her deluded is a stretch. I mean she is not completely wrong. You did lived together for 6 years, the reason why you are not getting anything is because you were not married. If you were divorced, things would have been different. So maybe she is seeing it from that perspective?", "A little entitled that mum. As if living rent and mortgage free was something you need to be compensated for. Sometimes moms are like lawyers and can only argue for their side. She loves you but don't be afraid to tell her how you feel when she makes you upset", "NTA. Perhaps you could apologise to her mum for upsetting her but explain that her keep focusing on the breakup is bothering you and you would feel more supported by her just not mentioning it at all.", "NTA. Even if her initial comments were meant to be supportive, the fact that she ignored your response means that she's now being intrusive and unhelpful.", "NTA just for \"until you apologize for your outburst I don't want to see you.\" This is such a childish way of handling disagreements, and anyone who does this is the AH.", "NTA and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get downvoted but depending on the country you live in you are entitled to half.

Or anything else?\n\nFor what it's worth, common law marriage isn't a thing in most of the US these days either. It's been phased out in all but a few states because it's just a massive legal headache, and where it does exist, it generally requires that the couple agreed to be a married couple and represent themselves as such to the community.\n\nSo if people are saying you're common-law married, they probably don't know how the law works where they live either.", "NTA- and I'm kinda petty but this is what I would offer your mom-\n\nMom, I'm sorry I called you deluded.

Your mom needs to back off and remember that you can handle your own life.", "So your mum has agreed to no contact until you apologize. That's actually a good thing. No contact will give her the opportunity to see that you can live without her input OR your exes \"support\". When you have your home fully furnished, call dad and invite them over again.

But if you can, give her a bit of grace -- she won't do this forever.", "Common law is not a thing in most of the states anymore I dont know what the redditor that you are commenting to is going on about. NTA", "It doesn't entitle op to anything. Common law marriage is not a thing in all of America", "You seem super condescending.", "NTA. \n\nEta2:  The US has become an extremely litigious nation. Is annoying as hell, and drives the cost of things (like healthcare) up. Many people take advantage of this regardless of if it is the right thing to do or not.", "Based on your age and how long you were together is it safe to assume this is the first time you\u2019ve ever really lived alone? I think your mom might be struggling to think of you as an adult that is fully capable of taking care of themselves. \n\nI say this as a way to maybe explain her feelings but not to excuse her behavior.  Your mom is being very inappropriate, and her ultimatum is ironically going to give you some much needed space.  Don\u2019t apologize if you\u2019re not sorry.  Live your life for a while free of her meddling and hopefully it will help her see that you really are ok and you can handle your business.", "NTA, this post reminded me of my mom so much. I have almost no relationship with her because she is incapable (or perhaps unwilling) to comprehend that her style of support is overbearing, commandeering, unhelpful and **unwanted**. \n\nI gave up trying to work with my mom on that, nothing I can say or do will ever get her to change, not even for me, her only child. Once I realized she'd never change, it became clear I was the one that had to change, by going LC with her. It's been that way for years now. \n\nNot saying you should immediately go LC, just relaying my experiences with this.", "NTA There is nothing worse than someone who isn't supporting you moving forward, but keeps harping on about the past. Especially for giving legal advice that wouldn't apply and just keeps you from moving on. As for second hand furniture, that stuff is great. UK is the best for great charity shops. Pine tops can be sanded to get that orange look out of it and refinished. The body of it is great for painting to look exactly like the modern painted wood finishes. Farrow and Ball estate eggshell is ace for that shop bought expensive look, or Annie Sloan chalk paint with a wax finish on top for a more shabby chic look.", "NTA.\n\nInfo: was this your first long term relationship? \n\nI think everyone's right - your mom was coming from a place of love and \"momma bear\", but she got too involved and is also just from a different generation.\n\nShe was probably raised to think women must rely on men, whether she realizes this or not. She just wants her girl to get everything she can from a man she (your mom) thinks hurt her girl.\n\nBut she is delusional and you have the right of this situation.\n\nGetting cheap now and upgrading when you can is responsible. You can also get great deals and items cheaper, and why not? More money for you. I recently bought a full set of nice chairs from a thrift shop - 4 for $25 and they're an upgrade from my previous used set. All wood with leather upholstery and minimal wear.\n\nHonestly, I kicked my mother out of my apartment when she wouldn't stop insulting it or me - and I haven't spoken to her in 4+ years. It's been great for my mental and emotional health.\n\nSometimes if mother's can't let go of their adult kids, the adult kids have to cut the cord ourselves before it strangles us.", "NTA", "Your mom sees you as vulnerable on your own.

Perhaps that will sink in for her.\n\nTo all of those people who feel you are owed:  it is not a wonder you are divorced or single.  There are only 8 states in the USA who still have some form of common law marriage.  It requires very specific actions for a common law marriage to be valid.
