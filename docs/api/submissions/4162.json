No kids and we weren\u2019t married. The breakup was relatively amicable and smooth. He let me stay in the house until I found another place to live and I managed to move out and into a new place after a month. The house is HIS house. Only his name and only he paid the mortgage. I never paid anything. I only contributed to bills, food shops and anything we bought together. I took the furniture items I bought myself which was just a desk, the dining table and some others and I\u2019m fine with that. I\u2019ve been sourcing some cheap furniture and stuff in this time. I\u2019ve had no contact with my ex since moving out as everything has been sorted so why would I?\n\nMy mum has been checking in on me. This is fine but it seems to be a lot more than normal. She is quite old fashioned and doesn\u2019t seem to understand how we had an amicable breakup. She thinks if we were fine for so long why did it end. We just grew apart. It\u2019s kinda annoying but I know she\u2019s doing it from a place of love. My parents were round at my flat the other night. I invited them round for dinner as I wanted to show them the progress I\u2019ve made with furniture. It\u2019s nowhere near fully furnished but I\u2019m getting there. Both commented that it\u2019s really pulling together and we enjoyed a nice meal. I thought the night was nice until my mum brought up my ex. (I should note my parents have not offered any financial help to me at all nor have I asked. I have been sourcing secondhand furniture from charity shops, social media marketplaces etc.)\n\nShe mentioned that I shouldn\u2019t be buying cheap things secondhand or having to do it over time. She thinks I\u2019m entitled to monetary compensation from my ex due to sharing a house with him. She would not shut up about it even after my dad and I protested and she was was annoying me.and eventually i laughed and called her deluded thinking I\u2019m entitled to money from a house I paid nothing towards.\n\nAnyway, my mum is pissed off with me. She says she is only looking out for me and that I \u2018deserve\u2019 something since I\u2019m now living on my own in a partly furnished flat. She says until I apologise for my \u2018outburst\u2019 she doesn\u2019t want to see me. Dad thinks we are both in the wrong and both need to apologise. My sister says Mum needs to stop being so involved in my business and stop harping on about the breakup. My best friend thinks mum is just trying to support me but is going the wrong way about it and that my reaction was valid but that maybe I should let it go.\n\nETA: my dad checks in on me, but it\u2019s a lot more relaxed and normal compared to my mother. He is quite relaxed and chill. They both love me very much but I do wish my mum could tone it down.\n\nETA 2: I\u2019m in England. \u2018Common law marriage\u2019 is not legally recognised here. I am not entitled to half of anything which I think some American commenters are mentioning. Why would I want a house that isn\u2019t even mine? Or anything else?\n\nETA 3: my mum knows we broke up due to growing apart. She knows I never co owned the house or paid towards it so I don\u2019t know why she thinks I\u2019m entitled to money.\n\nETA 4: please read my second eta. I am in the UK. There are no laws or legal rights for unmarried cohabitating couples unless you already have agreements in place such as a cohabitation agreement or if we jointly owned a mortgage. I also did not apply to stay in the property through a form of tenancy agreement.I literally do not want money and I\u2019m not owed money. Please understand that any non Uk commenters!

Especially for giving legal advice that wouldn't apply and just keeps you from moving on. As for second hand furniture, that stuff is great. UK is the best for great charity shops. Pine tops can be sanded to get that orange look out of it and refinished. The body of it is great for painting to look exactly like the modern painted wood finishes.

She may not be malicious but she is definitely manipulative: your mum is guilting you into responding to her messages when you don\u2019t actually want to, she\u2019s making you responsible for her feelings and expecting you to jump when she says so ie controlling you. \n\n I think that your mum has never really seen you as an adult capable of adult decision-making ie she still views you as a child needing a parent or other adult (a man?) to look after you and make decisions. When you were in your relationship your mum felt her child was taken care of and responsibility for you had been \u201chanded over\u201d and was no longer on her plate. With the split she thinks responsibility for your well-being is \u201cback on her shoulders\u201d and she\u2019s panicking and reverting to treating you like a child/teen. Hence the constant check-ins and not listening to what you\u2019re telling her because you\u2019re a \u201cchild\u201d so don\u2019t know how to \u201cadult\u201d and as a parent she knows best/better.  eg in her view, children don\u2019t know how to handle finances, therefore you don\u2019t and so were diddled by your ex leaving you struggling financially, leaving you poverty-stricken as evidenced in her opinion by your part-furnished home (which btw sounds fantastic).  For me, my dad was the issue, he grew up in an era where men were the family providers/decision makers and fathers were responsible for daughters until they married. So even though I had a job, my own house etc, because I was single he thought I should run certain decisions past him. Mainly big ticket purchases. I used to just nod and do my own thing but things eventually came to a head over a car and I pointed out that I was 30-something and I was damn sure he wasn\u2019t letting his dad decide if he should change cars when he was that age. He did a bit of a double-take, agreed that he definitely wouldn\u2019t have consulted my granddad and backed off somewhat. I realised that although he knew my age he didn\u2019t recognise my age until I put my foot down. \n\nYour mum needs to manage her own emotions and anxieties and needs to learn to see you for the adult you are. You can help by setting boundaries like expectations around when you\u2019ll text/phone or reply and minimising the info you give her.  Plus using phrases like \u201cthanks but I\u2019ve got it handled\u201d, \u201cwe don\u2019t need to discuss this again, it\u2019s sorted\u201d, \u201cmum, I don\u2019t know why you keep coming back to this, it\u2019s sorted and I\u2019m perfectly happy with how it\u2019s worked out\u201d.", "NTA.

She wants you to take financial recompense for your ex \"wasting\" your \"prime years.\" She's latched on to the idea of a shared asset because she's trying not to say, *I afraid no one will want my 30-something spinster daughter, and she should at least get money from this ex because only broke louts would still want her at this age.\"* Obvs NTA.", "NTA and while I don't know if your mom is either, I think her demanding an apology for what equates to nothing is a bit assholish and immature but I also don't want to make assumptions about her motives or her mindset. Just put your mom on an information diet for now, which should be easy since she is apparently not talking to you. LOLZ. Hopefully she'll see how silly she is being and move on.", "NTA, but I agree with your best friend.", "She does not need to apologize. Her mother cannot expect OP to deal with her emotions for her.", "...\n\nI mean yes, strictly speaking, it's true: if it had been different, it would have been different. That's hardly meaningful or helpful, though.", "...\n\nIf it had been different, it would have been different. So? How is that a meaningful or helpful thing for her to say?", "I know it's not meant to be malicious, but she doesn't understand why you broke up, and you don't have to make her understand. You being single or in a relationship is not up to her. Just take a step back and find yourself again, without anyone's interference.", "NTA. She is coming from a good place but times are different. She is not exactly deluded but just old fashioned.", "NTA. Mostly. I think this might be a situation where you should apologize anyway though. While she is in the wrong, we should all respect our parents (to a degree) and laughing at her I'd definitely disrespectful. I think maybe the right call would be to apologize, and explain that while she feels you are owed something, you don't feel that way or want anything. Tell her that you are happy with your decision and for her to respect you as she wants you to respect her.", "NTA, once you told her calmly and politely that you didn\u2019t want compensation it should have been the end of the conversation. \n\nThat she continued over you and your fathers objections is what made you lose your temper, and that\u2019s not your fault. She pushed and can\u2019t handle the push back.", "NTA. I'm with your friend on this. If anything SHE is the one who overreacted.", "I just hope that since you had no major expenditures for several years, you saved up quite a bundle. You seriously can't start pension planning too young!", "Though not maliciously.", "My mother is like this. Very overly concerned about her kids, calls me up to 8 times a day (even when I don't respond) because she's anxious about me or just wants to chat. I always describe her as a loving and caring person who is a good person but not a great mom.\n\nI'm in therapy partially because of her emotional dependence. I feel bad trying to distance myself from her because I know she's not purposely trying to be malicious or to baby me, but it's not good for either of us. I hope you guys can get to a better place and I think you are NTA", "NTA \n\nI was entitled to part of exes property but I was the same as you, split after seven years, no kids, I hadn\u2019t paid much towards the house and didn\u2019t feel entitled so happily walked away!\n\nYou don\u2019t need to take part of someone\u2019s property just because you\u2019re entitled. \n\nFunnily my last ex attempted to take some of my house. I laughed in his face and said I would bankrupt him in solicitors fees before he got a cent as he had done and paid nothing and it was under a year and I had owned the house 15 years. \n\nSooooo. Sometimes it is better to hold your head high and cut the cord and walk away", "NTA. You guys sound like you split the best way, calm and collected. You are not using him and actively looking to recreate your new life. Some people just don\u2019t see things that way and want to get every last drop out of a situation. \n\nStick to your guns and I am impressed with how both you and your ex handled the situation. You guys already did better than 80% of the population. Lol", "Of course she doesn\u2019t need to apologise. An apology may just enable her mum to listen to her properly", "An apology would just make her think that sort behaviour okay", "NTA, she crossed the line and you don't owe her any apology. \n\nEven in the US common law is more a myth than an actual legal doctrine", "NTA, you sound like a sensible person who ended your relationship sensibly. It is all very logical. Your mother is overbearing in this situation.", "Common law marriage exists to protect people who may not \"contribute\" financially, but their labour (house cleaning, cooking, etc) of support for their partner means that some of what their partner was able to accumulate is due to them. \n\nJust saying this so you stop saying \"Why would I?\" Or imply that if you did, it would be entitled behaviour. \n\nIf (and you may not have, not assuming!!) you have worked hard as a homemaker these last 7 years, you are ofcourse morally entitled to something. You are ALSO entitled to chose not to.\n\nMum moved into AH territory when she wouldn't let it go.", "Your mother is simply not being sensible.", "off topic but what does ETA mean? isnt it estimated time of arrival?", "I don't really think anyone is an asshole here. She is acting out of love for you and yes, she pushed it too far. You were frustrated yes and snapped back saying something that was possibly a bit too hostile. I don't think either of you wanted to hurt the other. Cool off and then talk. Make her understand and accept your boundaries, and then apologize for hurting her feelings and I expect she will apologize to you also. This fight is not something to damage relationships over.", "NTA. Your mom wasn't listening to you. She may have heard you, but she wasn't listening. She should be the first to apologize for getting into your business when it isn't warranted or wanted.", "They\u2019re also doing the exact same thing as OPs mom. Op doesn\u2019t want their ex\u2019s money etc, and everyone keeps commenting about it", "It took me a long time to learn that not malicious people with anxiety can manipulate or pressure you as a means of dealing with their anxiety,  and the lack of malic on their part doesn't make it any more healthy or any less harmful."]}
