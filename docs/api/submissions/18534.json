Also, is the group discount getting completely removed due to one person or just slightly less cheap?", "We didn't get clarification on the discount, it was just an indication of how small the party must have been, if they were right at some cutoff point. If it's a reduction by some small percentage due to one cancelation, then it's an even smaller and more ridiculous thing to be upset about.\n\nEither way, you're not gonna find me on the side of the \"I just can't handle being around kids\" people. It's just never gonna happen.  If they can just such a huge swath of age groups as being too awful to endure being in their presence, then I can judge those people to be assholes. Nobody's going to jail or getting hurt. Some people are just assholes. And we're likely to always disagree on that. And that's OK.", "It is ok. Agreeing to disagree makes us better people. My thoughts are if I'm spending that kind of money and taking that many vacation days, I want to enjoy my stay while being there for my family. I can understand the sister's frustration if it's a huge swath of money, but spending money comes with the territory of having destination wedding. If you can't afford it while asking others to spend a shit ton, have a less expensive wedding.  Have a good day, though.", "And that's totally understandable. Framing it that way, vs \"being around kids will damage my mental health\" really does make all the difference for me. \n\nIt happens a lot on this sub, especially around weddings, where people talk about underage family members as if they're all dangerous sociopaths to be avoided at all costs. And then in the comments, people just trip all over themselves, telling each other that this is a totally normal way to act. \n\nFuck that. If you can't stand kids, that is a personal failing that you (or OP, or whoever) should work to overcome. It's not a fucking food allergy that other people need to respect. And I won't."]}
