You didn\u2019t choose anything over her wedding. You are still going, just staying elsewhere. Any discount she would have gotten for you staying would have been negligible in the scheme of things.\n\nShe should be grateful you are even going. Destination weddings are hard work", "NTA; you came up with an alternative arrangement in DR so that you could attend the wedding festivities and protect your sanity. There's nothing wrong with avoiding children while you are away, particularly if it has no substantive impact on the wedding party.

Get dem Legos!", "NTA if you're paying you can stay where you want. I don't understand why they think it's ok to have you pay a crazy amount of money for a vacation you won't enjoy. If they're paying you can stay where they want you to but otherwise she should be grateful you're willing to shell out a load of money to be at her wedding... Go to the adult only resort anyway for a fun holiday and skip the wedding.", "NTA, my kids are grown and we never stay at family friendly resorts because we prefer our holidays without children.", "NTA. It\u2019s really vulgar of her to think she can decide where you get to stay just because it affects her budget.\n\nDon\u2019t have a wedding you can\u2019t afford.

And in this case, you\u2019re being asked to defray the cost of a wedding the couple can\u2019t afford.

I have a destination wedding coming up in the fall, using the link from the bride and groom rooms were $600 cheaper for the week.", "NTA\n\nThe way those discounts are structured, your sister is expecting you (by overpaying for your stay) to help pay for her wedding.  Nope.", "NTA You're not choosing your mental health over her wedding; you're choosing a different hotel over the one she chose. She's choosing to be a mercenary lunatic over a small thing that would make all the difference to you. What a horrible indictment of her as a host.
