Staying at a different resort means exactly what it says. Insane how you think that she will isolate herself from her family just because shes at a different resort.", "That\u2019s not why she\u2019s isn\u2019t going and you would have know that if you read her post. I\u2019m not confused. Neither is anyone else here. It\u2019s just you sweety.", "If you find yourself unable to give a fuck for 24 hours or longer, contact your doctor, and tell them how great it is. They may need to take Fukitol too.", "After reading the post, I'm not sure she even likes her own family. She makes them sound like an inconvenience rather than people she cares about.", "the literal reason she said she isn\u2019t going is because she doesn\u2019t want to stay at the family friendly resort"]}
