They both suck. The sister doesn't get to tell OP where to spend their own money, and OP is an asshole for saying being around their younger family members will damage their mental health. Is that any more clear?", "Yes you do lol. Jesus Christ man just say you hate kids. Like if you cant stand being around something then you hate it.", "Jesus Christ, scroll up, people.", "You must have missed my original response to OP", "A wedding in and of itself is selfish 100%. But if that's how you feel just don't go at all and dont celebrate weddings instead of making yourself a nusance and crying because you cant handle kids.", "Yeah, love when random redditors put words in your mouth lol I am mad I even responded with an explanation.", "Are you a mental health professional, are you OP\u2019s mental health professional? \n\nWhat qualifies you to evaluate whether or not consistently being around kids for a week can impact OP\u2019s mental health?", "Mmm...no I don't. It's weird that you think that I hate my 11 nieces and nephews because a week would be a bit much for me. It's a shame that your thinking isn't nuanced in the slightest.", "This is exactly what she proposed and was scolded by her sister.", "Hahaha he\u2019s probably just a kid himself oh well", "Are you joking? This is the internet. No one is a professional anything. And this forum wouldn't be the olace for them, if they were. But since you asked, I diagnose OP as suffering from asshole-affective disorder. Treatment recommendations: cranial rectal extraction, followed by an intensive 3 week course of getting-the-fuck-over-themselves therapy.", "Dude just say you hate kids. Not  a big deal", "I\u2019ll drink to that \ud83c\udf7b", "I find that when I'm being irrational, watching a favorite television show or going for a jog makes me feel better. I hope this helps, and I hope you have a good day.", "Lmao calm down, just cause you have a few kids you regret, doesn\u2019t mean everyone hates them by proxy.", " Do you judge people who don't want any children, as well?", "No, fuck that. If I don't want to be around kids, that's my prerogative. If I don't want to be around people, that's still my prerogative. That doesn't make the kids bad, I just don't want to deal with them.", "Not liking kids is not a personal failing. Some people don't like pets, or a certain type of food and all of it is ok. You are coming across as a judgemental AH."]}
