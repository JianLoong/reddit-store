If OP said \"im paying all fees the resort is charging you on my behalf\" this is a clear cut and shut deal everyone is happy. However OP isnt doing that and we know they're not wanting to because it would've been stated.", "Thank you. I have crazy sensory issues. Doing my absolute best would be a day and a half. Then after that, I'd have an emotional breakdown and self-isolate. It has nothing to do with hating kids. My nephews are incredible and I love them. That doesn't mean I can spend more than a few hours with them. It's not my fault and I do try. But don't attack me because I'm mentally and neurologically unable to do so.", "Have you been to resorts full of children vs adults only? I have and I'm gonna tell you, the adults only one was much louder on the weekends because the pool is going full party mode. Imagine hearing thumping music all day and most of the evening until \"quiet time\". \n\nThe children are mostly confined to common areas like the pool and the beach which are normally always loud. Otherwise, stop making excuses for immature people. Children are gonna be the last problem for people with sensory issues if you're at a resort for a week.", "But that would mean pressure build up in the ass. Not that they couldn\u2019t see it. Rectal cataracts would be better\u2026.", "Not to mention these resorts are huge... she's gonna want to shuffle back and forth from the two all week?", "I think if they\u2019re traveling out of the country for a full week, its reasonable to pick a hotel that will be more relaxing. Might as well do it how you want it if you\u2019re making the trip, the wedding is only one day of it.", "OP is not incurring extra costs on her sister. With many destination weddings at resorts, the couple gets a discount or benefit based on how many guests they bring to the resort. Essentially subsidizing the cost of their wedding by passing the cost along to the guests. \n\nSo her sister isn\u2019t paying additional fees, she just not getting as much of a discount. \n\nSister gets to decide where she holds her wedding, she doesn\u2019t they to dictate where her guests stay for the entire week.", "What a ridiculous take. Choosing not to be around children is not \"treating them like lepers\". No one has any obligation to spend time around other peoples' children. There are a lot of adults I won't spend much time around, either -- and that's not \"treating them like lepers\", it's just making perfectly legitimate choices about whose company I would like to keep.\n\nAnd wow, aren't you ableist -- trivializing peoples' disabilities and traumas as \"shit they need to work out\" instead of accepting that these are perfectly legitimate reasons to not spend large quantities of time around loud, rambunctious children.\n\nI'm also not clear on why children whose parents are treating them to holidays at resorts would be in need of \"empathy\". They're getting a holiday and OP's absence from their lives does not harm them in any way.\n\nChoosing to not be around children is not selfish, nor does it make a person an asshole. It's a reasonable personal choice.", "Not true. I wouldn\u2019t spend thousands of dollars to go to a family friendly resort when I could pay the same for adults only. It\u2019s about preference. Doesn\u2019t mean they hate kids. They just don\u2019t care to spend all that money to have kids running around. Different strokes for different folks.", "If I took time off work to take an expensive vacation, it would be for enjoyment and relaxation (some might even consider this a form of taking care of your mental health and well-being). If OP says spending a week at a resort which caters to families with children will be detrimental to their mental health, it shouldn\u2019t be that difficult for you to comprehend. Their money, their time, their vacation, their choice. OP is NTA but a lot of people telling them what to do with their time, money, and vacation are. And the ones judging the validity of what contributes to their well-being.", "That's how it always is on AITA. You can't have a preference for something no, no, no it has to be a *medical condition* because if it's just a preference people would get called out but they think if they couch it in terms of a medical condition that somehow absolves them of their responsibility to the rest of society.\n\nChrist this sub has such a fucked up view of humanity.", "I\u2019m a nanny and honestly even I side with OP. I hate spending time with large groups of kids puts me so on edge in a way I can\u2019t describe. I need breaks. Perfectly reasonable for her to come chill with the fam then duck back to her hotel when she needs a breather. I\u2019d do the same.", "But OP didn\u2019t specify that the kids solely would be the cause. It seems like having a sister that cares more about money and a discount rather than your feelings, having parents that should be there for you also side with money and discounts and clearly favoring your sister, the fact that many of the guests also brought their children, so spending any time with family would also mean being around kids that are in vacation mode, and adults that are also thinking about vacation mode meaning they probably won\u2019t reign in their kids when they\u2019re being disruptive or acting out, may lead to a drop on one\u2019s mental health. Not to add that the parents would also be forcing OP to stay as that\u2019s the vibe I get from them. A typical boomer going \u201cfuck mental health, if mine was deteriorated and I\u2019m still here then you can deteriorate yours just a little\u201d probably also goes \u201cI DEALT WITH THAT BULLSHIT AND I TURNED OUT FINE!\u201d If you know it\u2019s bullshit and you\u2019re forcing it on your own kids or others, you did not in fact turn out fine. And all that is what I\u2019m getting from the parents.", "She\u2019s paying for a week at a hotel and all the other costs that go along with that, including PTO probably. A wedding is usually one afternoon/evening only. Why can\u2019t OP spend their money where they want to? If sister needs a certain number of people to stay at the hotel to get a certain rate, that\u2019s her problem and that\u2019s the risk of a hotel block.", "So, is OP planning on hanging out in the kid\u2019s club at the resort all day every day or hang out at the family pool for 6 days straight? I don\u2019t see how he will have constant nonstop exposure to kids at a resort that\u2019s so different than what he experiences in every day life, unless the dude\u2019s a total hermit, which I doubt.", "OP seems to be over exaggerating A LOT.", "It's bizarre seeing these people trying to spin OP as a *bad person* for not wanting to be around kids all day for a week. \n\nOP isn't harming anyone by this.  They're not ranting and raving about how awful kids are.  They're just making a different priority for how to experience a vacation.", "Children do not, in fact, typically stay in their designated areas. The \u201cadults-only hot tub\u201d at the first all inclusive resort I went to was infested with kids. Not all resorts have staff supervising this, and parents are usually selfish and ignore these designations.", "OP should just skip the wedding and go on their own vacation.", "I choose to vacation in places that are relaxing. I don't like crowds, don't like nightclubs, and don't like loud urban areas. So should I be forced to vacation there?! No, of course not. Because it's MY vacation and I can decide where I want to go that's relaxing FOR ME. \n\nAnd yes, family friendly resorts are filled with kids waking up at 6:00 in the morning, running down the hallways, shrieking at the top of their lungs, and playing loudly. That's what they're for. Likewise, resorts for teenagers at spring break are filled with a million bars and tons of loud music and party areas. That's what they're designed for.\n\nWhy when you go to either of those places if that's not the kind of vacation you want to have? Why would you force somebody to go to one of those if that's not their idea of a vacation? People are allowed to live their lives the way they want, and it doesn't affect you in the slightest. Let people vacation and relax for God's sake.", "The adult resorts I\u2019ve been to were very laid-back and quiet. Not all adult resorts have wild nightlife.", "I'm sorry, but I don't really see why that's OPs problem if they'd be super uncomfortable in the hotel, honestly. I'm childfree and I think it's a little ridiculous, but I don't think OP is the asshole for not wanting to spend a lot of money on an expensive hotel they'd have a bad time in if having screaming kids in all of the common areas would be a huge detriment to them. They're presumably going to be there a little longer than the wedding to make it worth going.", "LOOKING THAT UP! THANK YOU! I love him. That man was a treasure.", "I don't mind kids but I wouldn't stay at a family resort due to the noise more than anything. My idea of a holiday is going somewhere with a relatively peaceful, calm base camp. I wouldn't want to have to deal with the noise that comes with children. Too much noise stresses me out and that's not what a holiday is for imo. At the same time I would feel guilty for being annoyed at them as they're just doing their own thing and deserve to have fun in their own way. So it's easiest for everyone if I choose somewhere likely to be quiet and calm.", "She wants to go. Provided a solution. \n\nSister is upset because she won\u2019t get more credit at the resort from OP staying there NOT that she actually cares where OP stays.", "TIL people think you\u2019re selfish and hate kids if you want to spend your money at an adult-only resort instead of a family resort. \n\nY\u2019all need to grow up. You\u2019re projecting if you think this is an \u2018I hate kids\u2019 situation. You either hate your own kids, or you think everyone should bend over backward for your kids\u2014 both of which are projections of your own ignorant beliefs. Very few childless people would choose to spend their hard earned money and PTO on a Disney Cruise surrounded by children; staying at a family resort is no different. If you\u2019d like someone to control your money (plus labor and time), force you to spend thousands and use PTO on something you don\u2019t want to do, that\u2019s your life, no one else\u2019s. Let people live their lives without your incorrect and shit judgment, ffs. \n\nA destination wedding is not and will never be reason for you to control someone else\u2019s money and time. A destination wedding is a vacation for all attendees, with a wedding as one of the events. If you want your guests to only focus on your wedding and your desires, you can fork over the cash for your guests to be there, but don\u2019t be surprised when people decline because they don\u2019t want to have their time controlled. \n\nNTA.", "They're already here.

Took even longer for me to stop.", "Maybe I'm not getting it bc I never stayed at a resort. What's the issue w kids also staying? Is it the general shared areas where they cause a rucus ?", "They literally just want to be in an adults only resort... There's a reason those exist! \n\nSometimes you just want a pool free of toddlers and floaty toys and that doesn't host a Disney themed sing along twice a day. \n\nKids are loud, their activities are loud, and on family resorts there are _lots_ of them. Especially since I'm betting they booked this during school holidays if there's families with kids attending. \n\nIt's not even an 'aversion' to say you don't want to go to a family friendly resort as a single adult with no kids - why _would_ you?", "This is the problem with the whole \u201cno one owes anything\u201d mindset AITA has. Staying at a resort that is family friendly should not be a huge ask (seek help if it is) and you\u2019re being selfish towards your family.\n\nLike in the real world, making a family member\u2019s life more difficult and expensive just because you can\u2019t cope existing in a space that has children (who you are not responsible for, don\u2019t have to interact with, and get to have a private room to sleep in to recharge!) makes you selfish and inconsiderate. Refusing to even go to the wedding makes it even worse.\n\n> prioritizing mental health over her wedding\n\nOP\u2019s attitude makes it even worse. They sound quite exhausting.", "Basically has a waterpark and lots of loud entertainment.\n\nThere are other resorts that allow kids but have different vibes though.", "There's a massively different vibe between an adult's only place and family ones.\n\nFamily resorts = screaming kids at the pool and/or beach all day, most of the facility tailored around being kid friendly.\n\nAdult's only is way more relaxing if you don't have kids.  \n\nAlso some of the adult only ones are notorious for singles hooking up lol.", "I doubt it as much to do with children being unbearable and more to do with catering to demographics that don\u2019t have young kids (older adults, single people, child free couples, etc.) \n\nI find it interesting that people constantly act as if children are uniquely terrible and extremely insufferable when adults are also capable of being just as loud and annoying.", "I don't think you own your guest's time (and money) just because you decide to get married at a resort.  \n\nOP's going to be there for the wedding.  In a conventional wedding, that's all you get from your guests.

And I specified that if it was financial, it would be a hard NTA. The main issue is OP piggybacking on her sisters wedding to take a vacation to the same place at the same time and not wanting to spend that time with their family. Ofc no one owns OP's time, but if OP is going to fly to the destination for the destination wedding there is a obligation to spend that time with the family. Otherwise just skip the wedding and take a solo vacation where ever OP wants without anyone else's permission.", "The difference is, you can tell the staff if someone is causing a disturbance at an adults resort and they'll stop them or throw them out, even call the police on them if it's that bad. They're adults, they're accountable for their actions, they can't harass people or party till all hours and disturb other guests. \n\nKids? If it's _really_ bad staff might ask the parents nicely if little Timmy could maybe be told not to do that.

I love kids, but I do understand preferring some time on a vacation you\u2019re paying for to be quieter and more relaxing. Compromise seems to be possible here. Currently though ESH. OP claiming it\u2019s about mental health is absurd, while sister just wanting a better deal is also shitty. However, logistically, it seems like a major potential issue for OP to be fully staying at a different resort the whole time.", "ESH\u2026 you both need to work something out.  She is your sister and you are her brother.  Perhaps only go for 3 days.  Let her know your plans to attend the wedding only.  The resort will most likely have an adult only pool you can chill at for a couple days.", ">Your sister is also an asshole for requiring you to stay at this specific resort. You're invited to the wedding and the reception. \n  \nI don't think you understand how all-inclusive destination weddings work. They're usually all-inclusive because they're on the edge of town (typically not the safest areas, but beach-adjacent) and it's a gated community. You can't just have non-guests walk in and out because then you don't know what amenities/drinks/food they're freeloading on, and there would be safety concerns (*especially* if there are kids staying there).

He didn\u2019t say anything about kids shouldn\u2019t be allowed there, he said he chooses to stay elsewhere. You\u2019re the one making a big deal out of their childFREE status, not the OP. \nAlso \u201cyou used to be one\u201d is one of the stupidest reasons to convince childFREE people they are wrong about their reproductive choices. They didn\u2019t have a choice about being a child. They have a choice about having a child. See the difference?  Let me guess you think childFREE people are selfish for not having kids too?
