I have a younger sister, Meghan, who is a 29-year-old female. She has been married to her husband, John, for about 4 years. They don't have kids together.\n\nI am a 30-year-old female. I work in the medical field and earn 5 figures\u2014a little background information. Our father passed away 5 years ago. He left me and my younger sister the house and everything else was left for our other siblings. The house was not in good condition when he died and as I was not living at home I decided I could've renovated the house and vacation there whenever I want to so that, my husband Tommy, and our two kids can have a place to stay as well as my sister and her husband.\n\nThe house was in serious condition and I paid nearly 300,000 to fix it up. This included remodeling the kitchen, bathroom, dining and living room. When I say everything had to be redone I mean EVERYTHING. The house is a 3 bed and 2 bath by the way so that was three rooms to renovate plus two bathrooms and we need new pieces of furniture and appliances to modernize the home.\n\nHere is the problem. I asked my sister to help with the renovation since it was her house too and more than likely she would wanna stay there when she visited. She said no and she wanted no part in that raggedy house, her words exactly. I didn't care because I was gonna do it anyway. It took me over 5 years to finally get the house fully renovated and it looked amazing! Since nobody would be at the house, I turned it into an air bnb to make some money and pay for the upkeeping of it.\n\nRecently, something happened to my sister's husband's mother and they had to go back home to check up and take care of her. My sister asked me for the keys to the house so that she, her husband, and his mother can stay there until she gets back on her feet. She also demanded that food have to be in the house when she arrives lol. I'm not her maid. She probably saw the house after renovations and wanted to show it off.\n\nI told her no and reminded her of what she said years ago. Plus the time she's staying there, the house is booked for that time. I asked her if she would be paying to stay in the house as the bills had to be paid after they left. She said no and that it was her daddy's house and she wanted to stay there. Well, I told her that she needed the keys first. She started calling me some names that I will not share here.She told everyone at home what I did and they're on her side. Why should I lose profit on the house because she wanted to stay there free of charge? Things these days are not cheap and she can pay to stay at a hotel or at our sibling's house. I stand by what I said and will not let her in the house unless she's paying to stay there. She wanted no part in the house and plus she didn't help me with the renovations. My husband is on my side since he's been there with me during those 5 years of the renovations and has seen what it has put me through. So am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: For those in the comments saying I am in legal action, I am not. Before I started renovations on the house I asked my sister if she wanted to help since it was both of our home. She said no so I DID buy her out of it as I have known this would've happened. My husband helped me with everything since he is a lawyer and recommended one of his law friends. By the way this house is not in the US. It is in the Caribbean and if I hadn't bought her out, the house would've been mines regardless because I have been paying for the house for more than 5 years and by LAW it would be  mines. I just posted this here just because I wanted to. \n\nI don't care about anyone's opinion really. I stand by what I said because of her audacity to treat me like a slave and not pay for anything whiles she is there. Who knows how long she's planning on staying?", "created_utc": 1690210637, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158d1am/aita_for_not_letting_my_younger_sister_stay_in/", "score": 447, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I did buy her out since I forgot to mention. That was when I first started thinking of renovation and she said she wanted no part in it. At first, she was against it because she knows that I was renovating but I said I wouldn't renovate no more since she didn't want to help me. I tricked her obviously but there isn't any law that says I can't do that. By the way, this vacation home is not in the US it is in the Caribbean, and by law after 5 years of keeping the property by myself without help it is legally mines. Just for clarity. I will post another update if anything else happens", "There really needs to be an option for 'you aren't an asshole but you are dumb'.  You should have bought her out before you renovated.  She owns half of it and you dumped a ton of money into without realizing that half that money was now hers?  If you buy her out now it will be for what the house is worth now vs. Then.  You might want to talk to a lawyer about possible options here, there maybe some way to buy her out for the old amoun but this could get super messy.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if she said she didn\u2019t want a part in your renovation. If she was named in your father\u2019s will as a part owner, you could be in for some serious legal trouble if you are denying her access to her property AND profiting off it without sharing the proceeds. She\u2019s acting like a brat but that could be the least of your worries.", "NTA\n\nYou bought out her 1/2 of the property.\n\nIt is no longer her \"daddy's\" house, it is your house that you have spent$300K to renovate and X amount you paid to your sister to buy her out.  Has your sister forgotten about the money you paid her when you bought her 1/2 out?   Did she understand that the money you gave her was for her 1/2 the house or did she think the money came from your dad passing away.\n\nBecause i cannot fathom why she would expect/demand to stay in a home she has no ownership in, for free.", "Info: did you buy her out?", "Ever heard the phrase \u201cmore money than sense\u201d?  \n\nYou co-own the house with your sister yet you acted unilaterally in rehabbing it and profiting off it.  You missed your prime opportunity to buy her out when she literally told you \u201cshe wanted no part in that raggedy house.\u201d  She probably would have jumped at whatever offer you gave her back then.  Now she might even be able to claim half of your airbnb earnings.  Consult a real estate lawyer, OP.  You are NTA but you will likely pay heavily for your mistake.", "ESH. It sounds like legally the house belongs to both of you, whether you like it or not. You (alone) spent money to renovate the house and now you (alone) are profiting, since it looks like she\u2019s not earning any money from you renting the house, ok fair ig. But the house is hers too and she doesn\u2019t need your permission to stay in it.\n\nOn the other hand, she needs to let you know beforehand that she wants to stay there, she has to pay the bills when she stays there (does she expect you to pay her bills? Cuz the fact that the house is partially hers doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have to pay the bills while she lives there, wtf) and she sure as hell can\u2019t expect you to stock the fridge for her or sth. You\u2019re both adults, do better.\n\nP.s. how is you having kids and working in the medical field relevant to the post?", "NTA but you're being a bit naive.\n\nI do not say this to insult you, OP. I say this because I'm concerned that you left yourself so legally vulnerable. Your father left the house to you both 50/50. You have since put a lot of money into it, and it sounds like you pay the bills on it as well while your sister does nothing.\n\nYou need to get a lawyer and recoup that money or have the house placed in your name. Until then, you are on legally questionable grounds excluding her from it. Please think of asserting your rights before she asserts hers.", "[deleted]", "YTA. She is, by law, an equal owner of the house. At the time of planning renovations, no new legal agreement was made.\n\nNow she can't demand to stay at the house while it's booked because she knew prior to her request to stay there it was rented as an AirBnB. She can't demand it be stocked (grown woman needing to do grown ass woman things). However, as a co-owner she has equal rights and access and when it is available she can stay without payment. Honestly, you need to get a lawyer and start figuring out how you are going to navigate this property in the future with your sister. It could get messy very quickly.", "YTA. The house is legally half hers. You cannot prevent her from accessing it. \n\nThe fact that your renovated it was YOUR choosing. You made the decision to assume the cost of it. It doesn't make it more your house than hers.", "YTA unless you bought her out, she is an equal owner and has every right to access the house. Doesn\u2019t matter that you paid to upgrade it. You can file in court to try and get that back via a suit after selling the place, but for now, you are majorly in the wrong by trying to block her from using the house.", "ESH but mainly because what you did was silly. He left you AND her the house. You decided to put all this money in the house and rent it out without getting anything in writing. You should have of bought her out of whatever her share would have been at the time your dad died and made this all legally only yours. Unfortunately, it is still her house and she has the right to the keys, regardless if she hasn't had help with one cent.", "ESH legally because it is half hers your sister does have rights to the home. OP I do understand where you\u2019re coming from, because you put all that money and energy into the house for years to make it livable. At the end of the day it was your decision to do so. \n\nThough you sister is an AH for her demands and the way she is going about this. She put nothing into the house and now she wants to reap the benefit.\n\nMy advice would\u2019ve been to contact a lawyer before you did all these renovations, to buy her out when the house was in the condition that it was. In the meantime, you may just have to let your sister live there, legally because she can, but she will be responsible for all bills and damages during her stay. \n\nI would recommend involving a lawyer now to figure out the best course of action. If that means buying your sister out now and figuring out the legality of the house that\u2019s what must be done. GoodLuck", "I wish there was an option for stupid. Renovating and renting out a property that you co-own with your sister instead of buying her out was a stupid decision but not asshole one or atleast only to yourself. I guess have fun in court.", "Info: a female what?", "Why didn\u2019t you buy her out before you started renovating?", "NTA.", "NTA but to your family you are, you should\u2019ve had a contract written up before investing money on it, now if you sell it and she\u2019s still on as owner she\u2019s liable to keep half of the money, that\u2019s really unfair and I\u2019m sorry but that issue should\u2019ve been taken care of years ago", "NTA unless she still owns half.", "[deleted]", "YTA, I understand what you're saying, but the time to decide this was when you inherited the house - you needed to either buy her out or not renovate. Legally, regardless of what you've done to the house, it's only half yours.", "You screwed up. She should have been written off of the house before you did any of this. Without that, you have no legal grounds to keep her out of the house, even if you feel entitled to.\n\nSo long as her name is also on that home, by law, she should be receiving half the profits from the Airbnb rentals after monthly upkeep bills.\n\nYou took it upon yourself to update the house instead of selling it without getting her name off the house first.\n\nETA: Pertinent information was left out of the initial posting. As such, my comment is completely invalid.\n\nThat being said, when something is this close to a legal question, places and laws pertaining to the situation should be mentioned as well as how they have or have not been abided by (steps taken).", "ESH you should have bought her out of her portion before you renovated it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's pretty bold of her to expect this.  \"Everyone at home.\" can take them in and foot the expenses.", "NTA obviously.\nIt's your place, she has no say. If you 2 had a good relationship you would have probably wanted to help but you absolutely don't have to", "Based on your conversations and your edits, NTA. Congratulations on getting the vacation home you wanted!", "NTA but seriously, lead with saying you bought her out and own the house fully otherwise it looks like you made a one sided decision and then declared that made the house yours", "NTA.\n\nYou bought her out. It's no longer her property, so she has no claim. Ask the family members who are criticizing you which of them will be hosting her.", "Well the fact that the post doesn't mention that you bought her out, kinda defeats the purpose.\n\nIf you bought her out, she has no right to it.\n\nIf it was vacant, it would be normal to let her stay there. Since it is not vacant, she can come another time.", "Well, the simple answer is that the house has been rented and there's no backsies with AirBNB - they take a very dim view of cancelling reservations.\n\nI have a summer house, same thing - it books out 6-8 months in advance, money has exchanged hands. There's really no backing out.\n\nAs it is a sibling, I would indicate that perhaps if they want to stay, they should check availability and you can either give her a week, or give her a friend & family discount, or barter an exchange of rental for something she can offer.\n\nHer insisting you provide food is ridiculous in this day and age - you can place food orders for pickup or delivery. It's on her.\n\nNTA", "\"I don't care about anyone's opinion really\". So why are you making a post here if you don't care?", "NTA.", "Having read that you bought her out (that is an important point), NTA. She wanted nothing to do with the house, so she sold it to you. That makes it 100% your house, not even a little bit hers. You put in the work, you get the reward.", "NTA, sissy doesn\u2019t get to mooch off you just because she\u2019s on hard times and her daddy used to own the house. You paid her what she was entitled when you bought her out and she has no right to demand anything else", ">Which is it - did you legally buy her half of the property so that it is fully in your name?  Buy her out means you paid her for her half of whatever the property was worth before you took full ownership.  \n>  \n>Or did you take care of it for 5 years so you feel like you\u2019re legally in the clear?\n\nalternatively... both things can be true. sounds like the law where OP lives cuts out signers if they haven't paid maintenance/tax but i'm guessing since OP knows their sibling, they also chose to buy the sister out outright to protect from any future tantrums.", "Well, if she bought her out 5 years ago, that completely changes things. Then it's not the sister's house at all.", "Yes.  That edit makes no sense.  Legal ownership is a major part of the issue and puts it in a completely different light.  OP clearly understands that her sister has no legitimate claim and she now claims \u201cnot to care about anyone\u2019s opinion really.\u201d  So why post here?\n\nI initially said OP was NITA.  But her edit makes me think she likes to play games and now I\u2019m not so sure.", "This", "That one data point \\_completely\\_ changes this from a Y T A to a NTA.\n\nIts really a difference between stealing from somebody vs dealing with an annoying mooch.", "Yeah if real", "NTA \n\n**You bought her out when she didn\u2019t want the house.**\n\nSend that to all the people saying she has a right to it. She wanted no part of it and sold her share. You paid for all up keep and renovations. If she wants to pay you to rent it then you could consider it. I wouldn\u2019t or she will use that to start more problems.", "NTA. It\u2019s not her house anymore.", "Till I read the the edit I was Y T A. But your sister sold her half to you! So she hasn't any legally right to stay there. And yes, saying that there has to be food is entitled. If she had asked nicely if she and family can stay there rent-free, only paying electricity, water... still OPs decision. And it is already booked.\nNTA.", "NTA\n\n1) You paid her for her share; she no longer has rights to it.\n\n2) It's already rented for the same timeframe.", "NTA but you should have bought her before the renovations. She can probably sue you now since it was left to both you. Read now that you bought her out so all yours now. People always want something for nothing. Stand your ground.", "NTA. You bought the house from her because she wanted nothing to do with it. YOU paid to fix it up, you have been maintaining it and running it as an air bnb. You get to say who stays in YOUR house. Sister can kick rocks.", "Once I saw the edit, I can safely say NTA. You bought her out for her portion. She has zero claim to it. I'm sure she just now wants a free vacation.  Hopefully you have some cameras because she's going to try to throw out the renters and take over.", "NTA. It's your house. You bought her out & renovated it with your money. Your husband being a lawyer is the cherry on top.", "Hell no, NTA\n\nBad enough she was insulting back when you were renovating. But demanding to stay for free and that you fully stock the house?!\n\nLawl, the audacity", "I was with you all the way until you said that you don\u2019t care about anyone\u2019s opinion. Why post here, this is literally a subreddit to get peoples opinions..? YTA because of your attitude", "NTA. Your sister is stupid. I\u2019m glad you put her in her place! Go low contact with the family that supports her side. She\u2019s stupid.  NTA", "Lol you're not an asshole. You're just an idiot. Have fun when you sister forces the sale of the house and you are legally obligated to split the profits.", "Nta. If you bought her out it\u2019s your house.", "NTA\n\nThe edit makes it clear that the house is legally not her property in any way and is your property. \n\nShe is entitled to no more access to it than I am. (Hey, would you like to let me stay free in your vacation home? I kid. I live in Florida; I don't like tropical vacations.) If she wants to stay there she can book it and pay for it.", "You're NTA. \n\n>Before I started renovations on the house I asked my sister if she wanted to help since it was both of our home. She said no so I DID buy her out of it as I have known this would've happened.\n\n\nCheckmate. It is not *her daddy's house* anymore. It is your house, your business interest. She has no claim to it and no right to stay there free.", "YTA - ...wait, all of this got posted on social media and your younger sister got FIRED because of this? Eeeeeeep. Hella toxic!", "Cause she\u2019s estupid!!!!", ">Before I started renovations on the house I asked my sister if she wanted to help since it was both of our home. She said no so I DID buy her out of it as I have known this would've happened. My husband helped me with everything since he is a lawyer and recommended one of his law friends. \n\nThat's a pretty significant piece of info to have left out. Your sister got her inheritance, and now she wants to just demand the free use of your home at your expense whenever, and for as long as, she wants.  NTA.", "It's against the rules of the sub to post here when you don't think you might be the asshole.", "That DEFINITELY needed to be in the update. Because most of us are here think she still has legally her share in the house and that you just poured money into assuming it therefore yours. That\u2019s like wildly important here and I\u2019m side-eying you a bit for not thinking to include it.\n\nNonetheless if you bought it out from her and then renovated it and turned it into frankly whatever you liked, then no it\u2019s not hers and she should have no legal rug to pull from under you which just leaves a general verdict that should look more like:\n\n\u201cMy father left us together a house. It was raggedy and I bought the house out from my sister so I could renovate it and turn it into an Airbnb. She agreed so it\u2019s mine now and I did such. Now she feels entitled to stay it, which she is not and especially wants to do so when I already have people who would be staying in it.\u201d\n\nBoth ways there you are not the asshole. But man, talk about misrepresenting yourself.\n\nThat said your info is still a bit confusing. Am I correct to understand you expressed your intentions to renovate, she didn\u2019t want to pay for that, but you did so anyways and with years of doing that it\u2019s now yours? Where in that time did you buy out?", "Awesome!! Still NTA either way!!!!  Go about and enjoy the home and make money off your investment!!!", "So you thought the fact that you both inherited the place was relevant to the story, but the fact that you bought her out and own it outright now wasn't? \nThen got upset when people responded based on what you wrote and didn't take into account the extremely relevant information you left out?", "She owns the house, she bought out sisters half", "Yea really should have started with this,  key information.\n\nNTA", "This was a bit like my own situation.  My parents died 10 years ago. Not a lot of money but they had a condo in Florida that my brother wanted.  He got that. My father\u2019s picture and my father\u2019s cross that he claimed he wanted but never wears.  My parents left their Impala to me because my car was older and starting to give me problems.  I told my brother we were thinking of selling their car and buying something newer.  Turns out my brother and SIL kept harassing us about getting half the money when we sell.  So I asked them if they were chipping in on the repairs, taxes, insurance. The answer of course was No.  They stopped asking for half", "No, that detail make a HUGE difference. She has no legal right to the house and any access to it is at your sole discretion. NTA", ">  I honestly forgot to mention that I bought her out as I didn't seem like it would matter since that wasn't the problem.\n\nYou go from keeping your sister out of the family house to keeping your sister out of YOUR house, sister is a massive ass for demanding YOUR house for free with stocked fridges, she is only an asshole for asking for the family house with stocked fridge's.", "Was the home put in both your names after your father's passing?  Did you have her sign paperwork removing her name from the deed (with notary)?  \n\nEither way, you sure seem smug about a) your income and b) not honoring what your father wanted.\n\nEnjoy your bragging rights.", "NTA- if you bought her out she has no claim on the house at all. It's no different than if she sold to a stranger. She doesn't get to say well my dad owned it first so i am always allowed to stay here.", "NTA your house your rules", "NTA. You bought her out of her share and renovated it. You own it completely and it is booked at that time. Sister wanted no part in it until she thought she could demand a free stay complete with groceries.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your house legally and she has no rights to expect to stay there (even if paying).  It is non of the rest of the families business so they can butt out too.  You owe your sister nothing.", "YTA for this alone.\n\nI don't care about anyone's opinion really.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou bought your sister out of her share of the house.  If she still has any of that money left, she can use it to pay for accomodations.

The house is yours; you bought your sister out, put $$$$ and time into it, and are now earning some of that money back.\n\nIf you care to, show your family the purchase agmt from your sister, some of the receipts for the $$$$ you put into the house, and your upcoming AirBnb bookings.

It\u2019s yours. \n\nEverything seems on the up and up here, just that she cut loose too early and now wants to reap the benefits. \n\nShe can book through AirBNB (which I suggest you don\u2019t let her, she seems vindicate and may seek revenge in damages) or she can hit up a local hotel. \n\nHer inability to see the value in the \u201craggedy\u201d house and choosing a quick payout isn\u2019t your issue.", "NTA but LOL, YTA for your initial post missing the fact that you bought your sister out and you own the house outright.  You literally left out the most important thing", "You spent 300k and now your sister wants to spend time there.  The cherry on this sundae was when she demanded you have food on hand when she gets there.  Uhm, no.  Stick to your guns and ignore what the others are saying.

I have friends from the Caribbean and they would say that this legal ownership is not so relevant as who puts the time in love and care into a property.\n\nAmericans can be all about who is on the deed but you gotta wonder since America is stolen land anyway.", "That is quite the edit for OP to add after the initial post. For that, she is still an idiot and not an asshole.", "NTA...at all. You were never the AH in my eyes, but that edit was crucial information for sure!", "NTA but you should\u2019ve led with the detail that you bought her out lol, it would\u2019ve been a different judgement otherwise", "If you legally bought your sister out of her share of the home, you are under no obligation to let her use your house.
