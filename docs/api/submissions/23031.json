I have a younger sister, Meghan, who is a 29-year-old female. She has been married to her husband, John, for about 4 years. They don't have kids together.\n\nI am a 30-year-old female. I work in the medical field and earn 5 figures\u2014a little background information. Our father passed away 5 years ago. He left me and my younger sister the house and everything else was left for our other siblings. The house was not in good condition when he died and as I was not living at home I decided I could've renovated the house and vacation there whenever I want to so that, my husband Tommy, and our two kids can have a place to stay as well as my sister and her husband.\n\nThe house was in serious condition and I paid nearly 300,000 to fix it up. This included remodeling the kitchen, bathroom, dining and living room. When I say everything had to be redone I mean EVERYTHING. The house is a 3 bed and 2 bath by the way so that was three rooms to renovate plus two bathrooms and we need new pieces of furniture and appliances to modernize the home.\n\nHere is the problem. I asked my sister to help with the renovation since it was her house too and more than likely she would wanna stay there when she visited. She said no and she wanted no part in that raggedy house, her words exactly. I didn't care because I was gonna do it anyway. It took me over 5 years to finally get the house fully renovated and it looked amazing! Since nobody would be at the house, I turned it into an air bnb to make some money and pay for the upkeeping of it.\n\nRecently, something happened to my sister's husband's mother and they had to go back home to check up and take care of her. My sister asked me for the keys to the house so that she, her husband, and his mother can stay there until she gets back on her feet. She also demanded that food have to be in the house when she arrives lol. I'm not her maid. She probably saw the house after renovations and wanted to show it off.\n\nI told her no and reminded her of what she said years ago. Plus the time she's staying there, the house is booked for that time. I asked her if she would be paying to stay in the house as the bills had to be paid after they left. She said no and that it was her daddy's house and she wanted to stay there. Well, I told her that she needed the keys first. She started calling me some names that I will not share here.She told everyone at home what I did and they're on her side. Why should I lose profit on the house because she wanted to stay there free of charge? Things these days are not cheap and she can pay to stay at a hotel or at our sibling's house. I stand by what I said and will not let her in the house unless she's paying to stay there. She wanted no part in the house and plus she didn't help me with the renovations. My husband is on my side since he's been there with me during those 5 years of the renovations and has seen what it has put me through. So am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: For those in the comments saying I am in legal action, I am not. Before I started renovations on the house I asked my sister if she wanted to help since it was both of our home. She said no so I DID buy her out of it as I have known this would've happened. My husband helped me with everything since he is a lawyer and recommended one of his law friends. By the way this house is not in the US. It is in the Caribbean and if I hadn't bought her out, the house would've been mines regardless because I have been paying for the house for more than 5 years and by LAW it would be  mines. I just posted this here just because I wanted to. \n\nI don't care about anyone's opinion really. I stand by what I said because of her audacity to treat me like a slave and not pay for anything whiles she is there. Who knows how long she's planning on staying?", "created_utc": 1690210637, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158d1am/aita_for_not_letting_my_younger_sister_stay_in/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I did buy her out since I forgot to mention. That was when I first started thinking of renovation and she said she wanted no part in it. At first, she was against it because she knows that I was renovating but I said I wouldn't renovate no more since she didn't want to help me. I tricked her obviously but there isn't any law that says I can't do that. By the way, this vacation home is not in the US it is in the Caribbean, and by law after 5 years of keeping the property by myself without help it is legally mines. Just for clarity. I will post another update if anything else happens", "There really needs to be an option for 'you aren't an asshole but you are dumb'.  You should have bought her out before you renovated.  She owns half of it and you dumped a ton of money into without realizing that half that money was now hers?  If you buy her out now it will be for what the house is worth now vs. Then.  You might want to talk to a lawyer about possible options here, there maybe some way to buy her out for the old amoun but this could get super messy.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if she said she didn\u2019t want a part in your renovation. If she was named in your father\u2019s will as a part owner, you could be in for some serious legal trouble if you are denying her access to her property AND profiting off it without sharing the proceeds. She\u2019s acting like a brat but that could be the least of your worries.", "NTA\n\nYou bought out her 1/2 of the property.\n\nIt is no longer her \"daddy's\" house, it is your house that you have spent$300K to renovate and X amount you paid to your sister to buy her out.  Has your sister forgotten about the money you paid her when you bought her 1/2 out?   Did she understand that the money you gave her was for her 1/2 the house or did she think the money came from your dad passing away.\n\nBecause i cannot fathom why she would expect/demand to stay in a home she has no ownership in, for free.", "Info: did you buy her out?", "Ever heard the phrase \u201cmore money than sense\u201d?  \n\nYou co-own the house with your sister yet you acted unilaterally in rehabbing it and profiting off it.  You missed your prime opportunity to buy her out when she literally told you \u201cshe wanted no part in that raggedy house.\u201d  She probably would have jumped at whatever offer you gave her back then.  Now she might even be able to claim half of your airbnb earnings.  Consult a real estate lawyer, OP.  You are NTA but you will likely pay heavily for your mistake.", "ESH. It sounds like legally the house belongs to both of you, whether you like it or not. You (alone) spent money to renovate the house and now you (alone) are profiting, since it looks like she\u2019s not earning any money from you renting the house, ok fair ig. But the house is hers too and she doesn\u2019t need your permission to stay in it.\n\nOn the other hand, she needs to let you know beforehand that she wants to stay there, she has to pay the bills when she stays there (does she expect you to pay her bills? Cuz the fact that the house is partially hers doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have to pay the bills while she lives there, wtf) and she sure as hell can\u2019t expect you to stock the fridge for her or sth. You\u2019re both adults, do better.\n\nP.s. how is you having kids and working in the medical field relevant to the post?", "NTA but you're being a bit naive.\n\nI do not say this to insult you, OP. I say this because I'm concerned that you left yourself so legally vulnerable. Your father left the house to you both 50/50. You have since put a lot of money into it, and it sounds like you pay the bills on it as well while your sister does nothing.\n\nYou need to get a lawyer and recoup that money or have the house placed in your name. Until then, you are on legally questionable grounds excluding her from it. Please think of asserting your rights before she asserts hers.", "YTA; also possibly in legal trouble. If you didn\u2019t buy her out or negotiate ownership of the house, you are prohibiting her from entering into/profiting off of her property", "YTA. She is, by law, an equal owner of the house. At the time of planning renovations, no new legal agreement was made.\n\nNow she can't demand to stay at the house while it's booked because she knew prior to her request to stay there it was rented as an AirBnB. She can't demand it be stocked (grown woman needing to do grown ass woman things). However, as a co-owner she has equal rights and access and when it is available she can stay without payment. Honestly, you need to get a lawyer and start figuring out how you are going to navigate this property in the future with your sister. It could get messy very quickly.", "YTA. The house is legally half hers. You cannot prevent her from accessing it. \n\nThe fact that your renovated it was YOUR choosing. You made the decision to assume the cost of it. It doesn't make it more your house than hers.", "YTA unless you bought her out, she is an equal owner and has every right to access the house. Doesn\u2019t matter that you paid to upgrade it. You can file in court to try and get that back via a suit after selling the place, but for now, you are majorly in the wrong by trying to block her from using the house.", "ESH but mainly because what you did was silly. He left you AND her the house. You decided to put all this money in the house and rent it out without getting anything in writing. You should have of bought her out of whatever her share would have been at the time your dad died and made this all legally only yours. Unfortunately, it is still her house and she has the right to the keys, regardless if she hasn't had help with one cent.", "ESH legally because it is half hers your sister does have rights to the home. OP I do understand where you\u2019re coming from, because you put all that money and energy into the house for years to make it livable. At the end of the day it was your decision to do so. \n\nThough you sister is an AH for her demands and the way she is going about this. She put nothing into the house and now she wants to reap the benefit.\n\nMy advice would\u2019ve been to contact a lawyer before you did all these renovations, to buy her out when the house was in the condition that it was. In the meantime, you may just have to let your sister live there, legally because she can, but she will be responsible for all bills and damages during her stay. \n\nI would recommend involving a lawyer now to figure out the best course of action. If that means buying your sister out now and figuring out the legality of the house that\u2019s what must be done. GoodLuck", "I wish there was an option for stupid. Renovating and renting out a property that you co-own with your sister instead of buying her out was a stupid decision but not asshole one or atleast only to yourself. I guess have fun in court.", "Info: a female what?", "Why didn\u2019t you buy her out before you started renovating?", "NTA.", "NTA but to your family you are, you should\u2019ve had a contract written up before investing money on it, now if you sell it and she\u2019s still on as owner she\u2019s liable to keep half of the money, that\u2019s really unfair and I\u2019m sorry but that issue should\u2019ve been taken care of years ago", "NTA unless she still owns half.", "Sorry, OP.  YTA.  It doesn't matter how much you put into the house and how long it took.  The ONLY thing that matters is a little piece of paper with BOTH of your names on it.  It's called the deed.  She has every right to stay in HER house.  What you need to do is lawyer up and find out a way to buy your sister out at the price before renovations.  THEN and only then, will you be able to call the shots at the house.  It is her house, too.  Legally.", "YTA, I understand what you're saying, but the time to decide this was when you inherited the house - you needed to either buy her out or not renovate. Legally, regardless of what you've done to the house, it's only half yours.", "You screwed up. She should have been written off of the house before you did any of this. Without that, you have no legal grounds to keep her out of the house, even if you feel entitled to.\n\nSo long as her name is also on that home, by law, she should be receiving half the profits from the Airbnb rentals after monthly upkeep bills.\n\nYou took it upon yourself to update the house instead of selling it without getting her name off the house first.", "ESH you should have bought her out of her portion before you renovated it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
