YOUR rings, given freely by your grandmother", "I had a similar experience when I was 18 back in the 80s. My grandma left me her jewellery even though she had another, much younger granddaughter (she was about 3) from my dad's brother. \n\nAfter her funeral I was pressured by everyone, including my dad to share the jewellery. It wasn't many items, a watch, necklace and engagement ring. It was relentless and I gave in. I kept the engagement ring and handed over the necklace and watch. This wasn't seen in a good light with my grandfather telling me if it was up to him I'd have got nothing. His attitude came from long held jealousy over her motherly bond with me. Though he went onto develop a similar bond with my cousin. \n\nHowever a few years later my first husband,  an utter alcoholic physically violent person stole the ring and sold it. I never saw it again and I've carried a loss and shame with me ever since. \n\nI wish i had something tangible of hers left. But I have the best memories of her. My family blamed me for the loss of the ring and when I raised it with said husband he attacked me with such violence I ended up in hospital. My family said \"you made your bed, lie in it\"....\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, your family will always have an opinion on what's fair in their eyes and will apply pressure to get their way. But if you had the closest bond, and this was your grandmother's wish stick by it. People like your aunt had the opportunity to help her parents even being 2hrs away. She chose not too. Nothing she can say validates why your cousin should be given the jewellery she wanted you to have. \n\nAs for how your grandfather spends his money. Its his money. His decision. For me, my grandfather left the house spilt between my dad, uncle and cousin. I didnt get 1 thing but I didn't ask for anything. It wasn't my house and money. \n\nI hope it settles down for you. I'd keep the jewellery and accept the tuition. Believe me, if your family thought highly of you they'd not be pushing you to give up what she wanted you to have.", "NTA.
