One day as I was sitting with my grandmother she gave me her wedding and engagement rings as a 19th birthday present. I was completely shocked but flattered to be gifted these rings. But, this gift upset my entire family as I was not the next in line to receive them. \n\nShortly after her death, my grandfather received my grandmothers life insurance check. While eating dinner with my grandfather, he told me he has decided to use my grandmothers life insurance check to pay for my tuition and housing at college because that is what my grandmother would have wanted. My aunt (dads sister) is helping my grandfather manage all of his finances now that my grandmother has passed. When my grandfather told my aunt about his plans for the money, she was furious. \n\nMy aunts daughter was next in line to receive the rings I was gifted.

Selfishly, I want to keep the rings as my grandmother wanted me to have them but I also don't want to lose my family over them.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: I guess I used the words \"next in line\" out of context. My aunts daughter (my cousin) is the oldest granddaughter and was \"supposed\" to inherit the rings. My grandmother was completely coherent when she gave me the rings and asked me to take them off of her fingers and then she slipped them onto mine. It is one of my favorite memories of my grandmother now. \n\nI have decided to keep the rings and accept the life insurance / tuition money.

And until my parents passed, I visited home every year.\n\nWell, 47 years later (most of which I lived on the other side of the other side of the country) my husband and I have done well (for firmly) middle class people.  Our net worth is close to 2 mil, which is probably far more than most my family.  I have 3 other siblings with children, most who I barely know, and THEY have children I\u2019ve never met.  My 2 younger siblings are middle class poor, and none of their kids went to college and have service type jobs (supermarket, pizza place, etc).  The twins went on to have good jobs and are also doing well.  Their kids will undoubtedly go on to higher education.\n\nAll this too say, I have family members who would feel they need my money much more than the twins.  And after all these years, the twins have probably forgotten why they are special to me.  But I haven\u2019t forgotten, or feel differently.  And they are specifically named in my will (as are their children) whereas the other are lumped together as nibblings/grand nibblings.

Many arguments I see over gifts/inheritances have little to do with the \u201cthings\u201d (and money is a thing) but with deep-seated conflicts between family members about perceived favoritism and unfairness. Many of these conflicts date back to before the birth of the beneficiaries.

What I am trying to relay, is that even if you walk away from all of the gifts, you may still feel as if you \u201clost\u201d your family. The anger often has little to do with items and more to do with perceived slights. \n\nThe silver lining, if one can be found, is that many people respond to grief with anger. It is possible that as your family members come to terms with the loss of your grandmother the anger and conflict will subside.
