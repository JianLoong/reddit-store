{"id": 5052, "submission_id": "zp4owe", "title": "AITA for going on and on about the gym to the point of being boring whenever someone talks about my diet at work?", "selftext": "\n\n\nI'm a woman in my 20s and honestly I eat a lot. I'm a climber, hike and wilderness backpack, and cycle and swim a lot. Like pretty much all of my hobbies are sports.\n\nI'm also trying to build up my upper body and core strength for climbing so I've been lifting weights and eating even more recently. \n\nBut people have started to notice my eating at work, like usually I get a bagel loaded with eggs and ham and bacon and veggies for breakfast, eat a big homecooked meal with either a lot of protein and fat if I've got lifting or climbing soon, and a lot of carbs if I've got something that takes endurance like a long hike or bike trip coming up. I also snack a lot, on yogurt or granola bars, between meals. \n\nMost people at my job eat at their desks so I do too, but a lot of my coworkers have been commenting on how much I eat, how I'm constantly eating, or comparing it to their meals in a way that feels rude or judgy. Like saying how I'm half their size and eating 3x as much...\n\nEven when I've tried to shut it down, people kept commenting on my eating. And it was always different people, so when I told a few people off it didn't help much. \n\nSo I took a different approach, once that I honestly found a lot funnier. I just started responding like a total gym bro being like \"Nah I'm not worried about getting fat, I'm actually on a bulk right now.\" Or \"Nah this isn't a lot of food for me, I'm trying to carb load today.\" And then just go on a boring ramble about my macros. Maybe even pull up my lifting and macros tracking app on my phone. \n\nPeople tend to leave me alone after that, other than one of my coworkers who also lifts and likes talking about nutrition. \n\nI honestly find it pretty funny to try to drag out a boring conversation about sports nutrition whenever someone has something to say about my diet. Like kinda a \"oh, you wanted to stick your nose into my diet?? Ok, I'll tell you every boring little detail\" \n\nI feel like word that I'm a (very boring and long winded) gym rat has spread through the office, and everyone's seen somebody get stuck in a conversation with me when they comment on my eating, so nobody asks me about my diet anymore.\n\nSo it's kinda worked but I feel like it was a little douchey of me to try to make every interaction as uncomfy as possible.", "created_utc": 1671387718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp4owe/aita_for_going_on_and_on_about_the_gym_to_the/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're the ones who started it by commenting on what you eat, which is rude in general.
