Our mom died 8 years ago. She got sick just after Miley was born and wasn't able to get better. Our dad got married again 18 months after mom died. The girls and Sarah bonded pretty quickly and they would go between calling her mom or Sarah (what I call her). My dad and Sarah asked what would make me comfortable calling Sarah mom and I said nothing. I told them she was Sarah to me. She was disappointed but respected it. Dad did too.\n\nFor years I have told my sister's about our mom sometimes but the last twoish years they have asked for more. So I show them videos I have of her and photos and I have told them stories about her. How she loved us, how great of a mom she was. I showed them some videos of her singing to us and those videos were my sisters favorites. They even ask to listen to them if they can't sleep or had a nightmare.\n\nMy dad and Sarah are upset about the amount I talk about mom to my sisters and show them videos and photos. Ever since I started the girls called Sarah mom less and now they don't at all. They asked the girls why and they said that they didn't like calling two people mom. They also said I only had one mom so they should only have one mom too. They asked if I was telling them they couldn't and they said no, because I never said that, I just wanted to make sure they could ask about mom or see her if they wanted and that we could still talk about her together. Like I said I have done it for years just more after they started asking.\n\nSarah was really upset with them no longer calling her mom and she asked me if I would tell them to wait until they are 18 to watch the videos and see the photos again. She said the stories are probably okay but they are connecting with someone they never knew when they see those things and it's hurting their relationship with her. I told her I didn't want to do that because they should be allowed to have that connection to mom. That if she loved them that much she would want them to have that. Dad and her disagreed (he joined in at this point) and then they decided I could no longer share anything of mom with my sisters. I didn't listen. They didn't punish me for it but they said I am being cruel to the girls and to Sarah and dad told me it might have been what mom would have wanted, but everyone will have a certain amount of selfishness when they die in not wanting to be forgotten, but the people left behind are more important and the girls deserve to attach to a mom who can actually raise them instead of the mom they will never get to know or meet. He even tried to tell me I should focus more on Sarah than my mom, since I have never treated her like she's actually my family or my parent.\n\nAITA for continuing? AITA for doing it?

No one is allowed to take those beautiful memories from you! And your sister\u2019s have every right to know who their paternal mum is. No one should be allowed to take that away from you girls.

Sarah has allowed herself to get comfortable with a title that wasn't really hers to begin with (for lack of better terms, I know that comes across as harsh) \n\nBoth your dad and Sarah are in the wrong for seemingly taking out their frustrations with this matter out on you.\nIt isn't your fault that feelings have been hurt. You were doing a good thing, and it should be seen as such.\n\nI would suggest possibly talking to Sarah and looking for an amicable solution, such as another reply suggested, an alternate maternal name.\nOr possibly letting her know that even though she isn't the birth mother that she is still appreciated in the role of a mother figure, if that is how your sisters feel.", "NTA", "[deleted]", "Absolutely not the asshole.

My hope is that you can express that you care deeply for her and your late mother, and that those two things can coexist.

I feel like that is something to be talked about by them. Since I will only ever call her Sarah and I feel like that kind of thing is best for those it directly impacts.

The reaction just seems so severe to me like you said.\n\nI'm probably the easiest target because I'm not all that attached to Sarah where my sisters are.

That makes them seem slightly less bad in this situation.\n\nI am more surprised that your dad isn't playing the \"mediator\" more in this conflict, it feels like that should be his job here as a neutral party who wants everyone else to get along and resolve this amicably (hopefully I'm not coming across overly judgemental here)\n\nIt looks to me like if you want to return to peace times in your household, you'll have to be the one to make the first move and do the heavy lifting.\nMy advice would be to try and squash this before it becomes all your relationship is with Sarah, if at all possible.", "I really don't want to be the one doing that heavy lifting. I feel like it won't end that good for me regardless. Because ultimately, it will come back to how Sarah is just Sarah for me and I do not want her to be my second mom or mom figure like she has been for my sisters.\n\nI think my dad does likely want peace between us. But at the same time he also wants a more cohesive family unit than we have/had before. Meaning me on the same page as the girls with Sarah. Probably even with the girls (and me) calling her mom all the time. So he's probably hoping the conclusion to all this being what they wanted from the start. It in his job though as the parent to all three of us and the husband to Sarah.

This preserves everything for you, and has the added bonus of allowing all of you to access them anywhere for the memories, school projects, etc.\n\nI\u2019m not saying they\u2019d do anything to the files, but it\u2019s best to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

Keep it up.", "NTA for sharing memories about your mom. However do you do other fun bonding things with your sisters other than talk about your mom.

I don't quite understand as to why your boundaries aren't being respected in this relationship.\n\nI feel, from your retelling, that you've been very clear with your intentions and feelings concerning your mother and Sarah, and that should be respected by everyone involved.\n\nI don't see how everyone can't get what they want here, without everyone calling Sarah \"mom\" (especially you)\nAlthough that does come with the assumption that you and Sarah were getting along for the most part before this got out of hand.\n\nYou could still be cohesive without any of that extra stuff on top (namely you and your sisters seeing her as and calling her mom) as long as there was mutual respect there.\n\nI hope things do get better on your end and the air gets cleared, but with situations like these, someone has to make the first move. In my opinion, it should ideally be your dad. Hopefully, he budges and everyone can reach an amicable solution", "NTA! Nope, nope, nope. \n\nAs a now adult (40) who\u2019s father died when I was 13 months what I wouldn\u2019t give to to have had videos, photos and someone willing to tell me more about my dad then some occasional annedotes as I have no actual memories just like your sisters. \n\nMy step dad didn\u2019t enter the picture until I was 14 so in no way was I ever going to let him be my \u2018dad\u2019 and he was never given the option of being more.

They deserve to know who she was and how much she loved them. They deserve to know she was a real and complete person and your SM and Dad don\u2019t have the right to take that away from them just because SM is in the picture and it makes her upset that the dynamic is changing.

There will always be the \u2018what if\u2019s\u2019, the daydreams, the wish that things had been different regardless of what info is or isn\u2019t given to them about their mum. \n\nNone of the adults in my life ever really talked about my dad. Not family or his friends and as I grew up I realised how much I wish that they had. It was always such a huge deal for me when someone told me I was or did something just like my dad. I craved that connection and still do. \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m projecting my own stuff but OP you are a beautiful human and an amazing big bro who seems braver than the adults around him.

I'm sure that your dad would not appreciate it if he died and a new father came in wanting you all to forget him and only focus on the living.  Instead of taking this opportunity to get even closer to you all by respecting your deceased mom and maybe even encouraging the girls to learn more, Sarah is letting her ego/whatever interfere.  It seems you are being singled out as the oldest and only child with these stories and memories to share.  If they can get you on the same page, then the girls will fall in line.", "NTA.
