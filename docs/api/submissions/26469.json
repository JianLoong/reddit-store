We have no custody agreement nor do I have him on child support. He agreed to give me $160 a week which he did for a month and then on and off whenever he could. \nAll I asked from him was to be responsible with the payments and if he wanted to see his kids he needed to give me a days notice so that I wouldn\u2019t make plans or if I had plans I could cancel them. I also told him that if he wanted me to drop off the kids I\u2019d be charging $20 for my time and gas. \nThis past month and half the kids have had invitations to birthday parties and I have been working so much to be able to keep up with all my bills especially because he hasn\u2019t given me a dollar in two months. So on the weekends I love spending time with my kids I plan outings and attend birthday parties. Well every single time it\u2019s an actual birthday party he will text me 1-2hrs before for me to drop off the kids. I remind him that I asked for a notice for this same reason because I already have plans with them. \nBefore some of y\u2019all get started on he needs time with the kids too I totally agree but I\u2019m also not going to cancel my kids having a good time so that they can go to their fathers place where he rents a room in a house with other men, keeps them in his room with no toys, and turns on YouTube for them (they are 3f and 2m). \nThe times I have been nice and taken them he tells me to pack them food I drop them off and within 2-3 hrs he texts me to go for them and my daughter comes back saying they were just in his room watching a movie. It\u2019s so much work for me to try and include him in their lives. PLUS he doesn\u2019t hold up his end of the bargain. No money for gas, food, or weekly help. \nSo today he is asking for me to bring the kids over and I responded that I don\u2019t have extra money for useless trips. Now I have his side of the family attacking me saying that I can\u2019t ask him to be a father if I don\u2019t give him times with his kids\u2026.am I wrong? I feel like I\u2019m doing my best for these kids to provide them with everything and a stable home all in my own and I wish they had a good relationship with their father but I can\u2019t do all the work for him too. It\u2019s exhausting. \nHe treats those couple hours that he will \u201ctake\u201d then every other week as a favor to me but it\u2019s not even enough time for me to catch my breath and it\u2019s so much extra for me to prepare and take them over.\n\nSide note he wanted to argue with me because our son has my last name and not his. So he said he would only give me $80 dollars a week because he wants to \u201ccorrect\u201d the last name to reflect that it\u2019s his son and then he will help. To which I responded $80 is fine I just need some help because I\u2019m not changing the last name and your not helping out or being a father anyways so why is it so important now. I feel like I\u2019m being reasonable. I don\u2019t bother him but he keeps pestering.

Bc I really wanna say ESH. Legally, even if he's not financially supporting he still has rights to spend time with his children. Even if he goes to prison for support, you still might be ordered to take them to visit him on weekends.   \nYou're not wrong for not taking the kids if you can't afford too. And if he doesn't drive, he should be putting in more effort to find a ride and pick them up. He can use yours, or buy his own, car seats. You are also not wrong for not dropping everything at his beck & call, and taking the kids to him. It's easy to communicate, and 24 hours notice is not impossible to give.  \nThe only reason I say ESH is bc you should have gotten a parenting plan in place a long time ago, and you'd be avoiding this entire mess. You're going to be dealing with headaches surrounding custody forever unless you go get a parenting plan filed in the courts.   \nBut at the end of the day, even if not financially supporting, all parents deserve time with their kids.

This is not their battle.  \n\nAs to what he does with his parenting time?  As long as they are safe, the court doesn't really care if they are bored.
