This is an update to my original post https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywtphc/wibta_if_i_wore_earbuds_at_family_thanksgiving/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nI want to thank you all for the suggestions and advice on what to do. I was thinking I should've just tough it out like I usually do. Now as some of you have suggested, I did get loop earplugs and tried them out and while I am getting used to them, I do see a difference in them. Not to mention they aren't as noticeable to see vs headphones.\n\nNow on to my mom. Tonight I told her that I got new ear plugs and she snapped \"what?!\" which took me back and a little scared by her reaction. I told her how I got new ear plugs that'll help reduce the sound so I'm not either quickly leaving the room or covering my ears. I casually brought up how I'm gonna wear them to Thanksgiving, expecting her to tell me how I don't need them. \n\nHowever, I was surprised that she didn't say that and said how I shouldn't make it obvious that I have them in and I mentioned how I can just cover them with my hair (for those asking about my hair length, my hair is shoulder length but I tend to tuck my hair behind my ears so yea). She said not to go and show them off or anything. I'm still not comfortable with telling the whole family that I have autism. I did text one of my cousins that I trust, who unfortunately can't make it to Thanksgiving, that I have autism.\n\nShe was caught off guard and asked questions like when did it happen and how do I feel about it. She told me that she would be there if I like to talk about it. I did answer her questions and told her if she had any questions, she can ask them. She said she knows other people too who can't stand being around loud noise. I trust with telling her the info about me having autism (aside from not saying anything for 9 months) and she was the first person in my family who wasn't in my immediate family to know about my autism.\n\nAnyway, I want to say thank you all again for throwing out your suggestions and now I have an easier way to handle the noise without the use of headphones. So again thank you!", "created_utc": 1668865448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzc6ni/update_wibta_if_i_wore_earbuds_at_famiy/", "score": 302, "replies": ["Excellent news. \n\nNTA. (Because that\u2019s the forum).\nI hope as you let people know they are equally supportive.", "This makes me so happy. So happy! Everyone deserves to be able to participate in family connecting without discomfort. You figured out a way to give and receive love from them. If anyone gives you any trouble about them, tell them that. \n\nMy Loops have saved my sanity in so many situations. And I also like how the don\u2019t look as obvious as regular earplugs. I got the silver ones; they look just like jewelry.", "NTA.  Wow, thanks for this information.  I have misophonia and have been looking for a reasonably priced option to wear during outdoor activities.", "NTA. I also wear my Loops at the grocery store and it helps a lot. All the overhead lighting, music, people and refrigerator noises were a bit overwhelming.  Now it's comfortable to shop. \n\nAnd yes, they are that good. I got my godson (also autistic) some for Christmas last year. He misplaced them and panicked because he couldn't bear the idea of not having them. He wears his at school to filter out some noise.", "Hey I\u2019m kinda getting to feeling that when your mom snapped at you before, she was overstimulated too. I have work at a hospital and when too many monitors go off, I\u2019m not the world\u2019s nicest person.", "Lol I also got the silver and the only time I plan on wearing them is when I'm in a room with a lot of people or it's a small room with a lot of people talking. I tried them out at work yesterday and i was excited that I wasn't feeling overwhelmed by all the noise. I don't plan on wearing them 24/7 because the only time I feel overwhelmed is when there're a lot of people and they're all talking at once. \n\nBut yea I have everyone here to think because I was beginning to think I should just go through another family event feeling overwhelmed and having to leave rooms because I felt having earbuds in would be rude. Then people started suggesting loops and I looked into them, a bit hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I went through with getting them! I can easily hide them behind my hair and still look like I'm paying attention.", "I got mine on Amazon for $40 (I had a gift card so $5) but if that's too expensive, they do have one for $20 if you want to look at that", "I'm glad you found some good ear plugs. I wear one earbud probably 75% of my waking time because I also get overwhelmed with noises. My hair is long enough I can let it hang loose over my ears, but I also sometimes just do a loose side braid in front of my ear if I really want to make sure I don't accidentally tuck my hair behind my ears. Or, a wide headband that covers my ears lol. Just in case you wanted some options to keep it as low key as possible, even with the discreet plugs", "Are they really as good as people say? I have a 13 year old with hyperacusis, and seems like they could be really helpful.", "I've lost like 3 sets of loops because I'd hang the case from my phone and it would open and one would go missing. I need to figure out a solution to that before I order more. But if you plan to keep the case within a bag or something I think they are fine.", "I have the Loop Quiet and the Loop Experience, and they really are as good as people say.", "I mean I got them on Thursday so I'm still trying to get used to them but yea I was excited that I wasn't getting overwhelmed by wearing them and feel they will help me in the future", "I currently am keeping them in a zipploc bag but jm hoping to find a better case for my loops", ">Loop Experience\n\nI've seen those, but didn't know that they were.  I thought they were some sort of jewelry!\n\nSo cool.", ">expecting her to tell me how I don't need them. However, I was surprised that she didn't say that and said...\n\nBet your mum is on Reddit and saw the last post. Sometimes it takes a stranger judging you to realise you are being an AH.", "You don't need to put judgements on update posts", "I have misophonia too (and APD). I wear the experience loops when ppl are eating and at a soccer game when i want to still hear some stuff... i love them! They're not perfect but they def help", "Nah ik she doesn't bake reddit", "You should also check out something called Misophonia that they are learning is a neurological condition.", "what great news!  I'm so glad.  If you ever have to say anything, you can say \"I have a hearing problem and have to dampen background noise.\"   Then you don't have to say anything about autism if you don't want to.", "Honestly I wear some noise reducing earplugs (like for concerts) sometimes around my family just because they're so damn loud. No need to tell them anything about autism, if anyone notices you can just tell them you have a bit of a headache and the earplugs help.", "I can finally go grocery shopping in peace too.", "I have misophonia as well and live with earplugs in probably 16 hours a day. I should look into Loop\u2026", "They kind of changed my life. I started wearing them to work at a busy retail store and had my first day of not feeling overwhelmed by the noise in 7 years. It GREATLY reduced my anxiety. \n\nI wear them anytime I go somewhere crowded and I have so much of a better time seeing friends. I wore them to a brewery night with my hair covering them and no one knew I had earplugs in at all. It was actually way better in general because I could hear the people at my table talking a lot more clearly. \n\nSo yeah, they're worth it imo!", "The price sucks - $50 in Australia for the Experience set but I can't live without them now. I lost one of them and didn't hesitate to drop another $50 because they help me so much", "Maybe test the waters to see if other people in Australia would be interested in buying them if an option were made available, if enough demand is out there maybe start a business crowd funder to become an official local supplier for the product?  Just an idea."]}
