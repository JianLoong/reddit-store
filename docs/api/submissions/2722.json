This is an update to my original post https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywtphc/wibta_if_i_wore_earbuds_at_family_thanksgiving/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nI want to thank you all for the suggestions and advice on what to do. I was thinking I should've just tough it out like I usually do. Now as some of you have suggested, I did get loop earplugs and tried them out and while I am getting used to them, I do see a difference in them. Not to mention they aren't as noticeable to see vs headphones.\n\nNow on to my mom. Tonight I told her that I got new ear plugs and she snapped \"what?!\" which took me back and a little scared by her reaction. I told her how I got new ear plugs that'll help reduce the sound so I'm not either quickly leaving the room or covering my ears. I casually brought up how I'm gonna wear them to Thanksgiving, expecting her to tell me how I don't need them. \n\nHowever, I was surprised that she didn't say that and said how I shouldn't make it obvious that I have them in and I mentioned how I can just cover them with my hair (for those asking about my hair length, my hair is shoulder length but I tend to tuck my hair behind my ears so yea). She said not to go and show them off or anything. I'm still not comfortable with telling the whole family that I have autism. I did text one of my cousins that I trust, who unfortunately can't make it to Thanksgiving, that I have autism.\n\nShe was caught off guard and asked questions like when did it happen and how do I feel about it. She told me that she would be there if I like to talk about it. I did answer her questions and told her if she had any questions, she can ask them. She said she knows other people too who can't stand being around loud noise. I trust with telling her the info about me having autism (aside from not saying anything for 9 months) and she was the first person in my family who wasn't in my immediate family to know about my autism.\n\nAnyway, I want to say thank you all again for throwing out your suggestions and now I have an easier way to handle the noise without the use of headphones. So again thank you!", "created_utc": 1668865448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzc6ni/update_wibta_if_i_wore_earbuds_at_famiy/", "score": 472, "replies": ["Excellent news. \n\nNTA. (Because that\u2019s the forum).\nI hope as you let people know they are equally supportive.", "This makes me so happy. So happy! Everyone deserves to be able to participate in family connecting without discomfort. You figured out a way to give and receive love from them. If anyone gives you any trouble about them, tell them that. \n\nMy Loops have saved my sanity in so many situations. And I also like how the don\u2019t look as obvious as regular earplugs. I got the silver ones; they look just like jewelry.", "NTA.  Wow, thanks for this information.  I have misophonia and have been looking for a reasonably priced option to wear during outdoor activities.", "NTA. I also wear my Loops at the grocery store and it helps a lot. All the overhead lighting, music, people and refrigerator noises were a bit overwhelming.  Now it's comfortable to shop. \n\nAnd yes, they are that good. I got my godson (also autistic) some for Christmas last year. He misplaced them and panicked because he couldn't bear the idea of not having them. He wears his at school to filter out some noise.", "Hey I\u2019m kinda getting to feeling that when your mom snapped at you before, she was overstimulated too. I have work at a hospital and when too many monitors go off, I\u2019m not the world\u2019s nicest person.", "Lol I also got the silver and the only time I plan on wearing them is when I'm in a room with a lot of people or it's a small room with a lot of people talking. I tried them out at work yesterday and i was excited that I wasn't feeling overwhelmed by all the noise. I don't plan on wearing them 24/7 because the only time I feel overwhelmed is when there're a lot of people and they're all talking at once. \n\nBut yea I have everyone here to think because I was beginning to think I should just go through another family event feeling overwhelmed and having to leave rooms because I felt having earbuds in would be rude. Then people started suggesting loops and I looked into them, a bit hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I went through with getting them! I can easily hide them behind my hair and still look like I'm paying attention.", "I got mine on Amazon for $40 (I had a gift card so $5) but if that's too expensive, they do have one for $20 if you want to look at that", "I'm glad you found some good ear plugs. I wear one earbud probably 75% of my waking time because I also get overwhelmed with noises. My hair is long enough I can let it hang loose over my ears, but I also sometimes just do a loose side braid in front of my ear if I really want to make sure I don't accidentally tuck my hair behind my ears. Or, a wide headband that covers my ears lol. Just in case you wanted some options to keep it as low key as possible, even with the discreet plugs", "Are they really as good as people say? I have a 13 year old with hyperacusis, and seems like they could be really helpful.", "I've lost like 3 sets of loops because I'd hang the case from my phone and it would open and one would go missing. I need to figure out a solution to that before I order more. But if you plan to keep the case within a bag or something I think they are fine.", "I have the Loop Quiet and the Loop Experience, and they really are as good as people say.", "I mean I got them on Thursday so I'm still trying to get used to them but yea I was excited that I wasn't getting overwhelmed by wearing them and feel they will help me in the future", "I currently am keeping them in a zipploc bag but jm hoping to find a better case for my loops", ">Loop Experience\n\nI've seen those, but didn't know that they were.  I thought they were some sort of jewelry!\n\nSo cool.", ">expecting her to tell me how I don't need them. However, I was surprised that she didn't say that and said...\n\nBet your mum is on Reddit and saw the last post. Sometimes it takes a stranger judging you to realise you are being an AH.", "You don't need to put judgements on update posts", "I have misophonia too (and APD). I wear the experience loops when ppl are eating and at a soccer game when i want to still hear some stuff... i love them! They're not perfect but they def help", "Nah ik she doesn't bake reddit", "You should also check out something called Misophonia that they are learning is a neurological condition.", "what great news!  I'm so glad.  If you ever have to say anything, you can say \"I have a hearing problem and have to dampen background noise.\"   Then you don't have to say anything about autism if you don't want to.", "Honestly I wear some noise reducing earplugs (like for concerts) sometimes around my family just because they're so damn loud. No need to tell them anything about autism, if anyone notices you can just tell them you have a bit of a headache and the earplugs help.", "I can finally go grocery shopping in peace too.", "I have misophonia as well and live with earplugs in probably 16 hours a day. I should look into Loop\u2026", "They kind of changed my life. I started wearing them to work at a busy retail store and had my first day of not feeling overwhelmed by the noise in 7 years. It GREATLY reduced my anxiety. \n\nI wear them anytime I go somewhere crowded and I have so much of a better time seeing friends. I wore them to a brewery night with my hair covering them and no one knew I had earplugs in at all. It was actually way better in general because I could hear the people at my table talking a lot more clearly. \n\nSo yeah, they're worth it imo!", "The price sucks - $50 in Australia for the Experience set but I can't live without them now. I lost one of them and didn't hesitate to drop another $50 because they help me so much", "Maybe test the waters to see if other people in Australia would be interested in buying them if an option were made available, if enough demand is out there maybe start a business crowd funder to become an official local supplier for the product?  Just an idea.", "I have ADHD and being around a lot of noise can really overwhelm me sometimes. I have loop earplugs and I LOVE them. They make such a difference.", "Happy to read about this. I have similar demographics to you and just bought the Loop headphones to dampen background noise and I\u2019m hoping they help! Anyone in the comments use Loop?", "Oh for the number of times I've had to push/squeeze against my son's one ear while the other ear is buried in my stomach from overstimming...sorry you have to go through that, OP. I hope that the rest of your family is more understanding if/when you feel comfortable telling them. My side of the family very much is supportive while my in-laws side downplay it every which way they can. It's maddening.", "Lovely to hear you got it sorted. You might want to check out Flare Audio Calmer as well - they\u2019re a bit like a normal ear plug, but don\u2019t reduce the volume - just reduces some of the more problematic frequencies. Works well for some friends of mine ; not so well for others, but everyone\u2019s different. \n\nHope you have a great event!", "So glad your mom is onboard with the changes you need. Honestly sometimes the smallest changes can make the biggest differences and you deserve as many accommodations from your family as you have made for them over the years to fit in.  You could also check out Flare calmer if you like the Loops. They do clear earbuds and you can also buy a little metal case to keep them.", "That's great. I'm also - idk I was diagnosed as autistic, might just be trauma, also have ADHD - anyway label not withstanding, I've also experienced this kind of noise sensitivity and I have a couple tips/life hacks\n\nSometimes, a specific thing you need to have a visible accommodation or aid for can be disclosed truthfully and matter of factly without using an actual diagnostic label. For instance, if I need to wear something like ear buds or ear plugs, I might say something like \"my brain struggles with audio processing in noisy environments and having soft music in helps me focus on the conversation.\" Instead of directly citing a dx like autism/PTSD/ADHD/etc. \n\nThis can be helpful where you need something that's unconventional but doesn't explicitly need to be labeled as related to a disability in order to make sense. Especially bc even if it is inferred by the other person a disability is involved, it's really hard to tell what disability. All the ones I listed could contribute, as could others like TBI/concussion, other neurological issues, chronic migraines maybe, idk I'm sure there's more. \n\nThe benefit is that it communicates enough for the person to know that you're doing something innocuous because it helps you rather than because you're rude. It discloses *enough* to steer decent humans away from thinking \"oh, that person thinks they're too good to socialize with is so they're tuning us out, how rude.\" BUT by not associating your aid/accommodation with a specific diagnostic label, you don't give the person a very broad term they may be ill informed about which they could use to make a ton of false assumptions. Nor fodder for a stream of insensitive comments and invasive questions\n\nYes truly shitty ppl will still find ways to be shitty regardless of what you say to them, but for the majority of ppl this has gone really well for me", "I have neurotypical friends who wear loops at concerts and other events with loud music, and they swear by them! And if you have pierced ears, there's at least one person out there [selling earring holders for them](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1300094930/loop-earplug-holder-earrings-hush?), so they look like regular jewelry when they aren't in and you don't have to worry about losing them.\n\nAnd if anyone tries to make you feel bad, remember that people wear hearing aids and the like all the time. I need to take breaks at large family gatherings to get away from the noise all the time, even as an allistic person, you're ahead of the game here.", "Posted this in another comment, but if you're into jewelry [you can get holder earrings for them](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1300094930/loop-earplug-holder-earrings-hush?)! Haven't tried them out myself yet but I'm looking into it lol.", "Looks like I need to find a way for a 13 year old to not loose them in class!", "They have an Aussie store, things are just that much more expensive here. \n\nIts called the [Australia Tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Tax).\n\nIt began as a combination of geographic isolation, low population, and currency differences. People now expect things to be more expensive so some companies also inflate prices just because - huge problem with service pricing where no physical goods are involved.", "NTA, i even fought the school my son attends over him using headphones or similar. I even have a spare pair on me at all times, just incase. \n\nWhy do people get so wound up on what another person does or wares, Autism or not, unless your running around naked then what is the problem. \n\nJust because people can't understand the invisible pain that sensory overload brings does not mean it made up,  attention seeking or rude. \n\n\nAlways do what is best for you, no one is walking in your shoes bar you.", "You sound like a sweetie.  Good Luck!", "Wow how did your get your loops so quickly? I'm guessing you're in the States due to celebrating Thanksgiving? I'm in the UK and it takes around a fortnight for loops to get to me from mainland Europe!", "Gotta look after yourself.  You'd be surprised how many people will drain you.  One suggestion: instead of music, have you ever tried white noise?  It might help deflect some of the negative assumtions others may make when they learn you're listening to music.\n\n(Or just tell 'em you're listening to it.  Heck with 'em.)", "I relate to this so much!  I keep bluetooth earbuds in my bag everywhere I go.  At the store, one ear bud in on something I enjoy and listen to the store if an emergency happen.  I use it as a focual point. (CPTSD and mild ADHD too.) \n\nSome people find it offensive no matter what, but also usually doubt mental and physical health anyway.  I ignore and grey rock them.  \n\nIf you explain to those who ask, most understand.  I'm glad you found a way to avoid over simulation and sensory issues.  Good luck this holiday season!", "I have hyperacusis rather than misophonia but I always recommend Eargasms or Loops to people! Both under $50 on amazon", "Yes I live in the US but I ordered my loops on Amazon and got next day delivery", "Wear them on a chain/cord around your neck. Loop actually sells one, although you can use any", "I actually found a earbud case that I feel could work and I can hook it to my bag, wallet, or keys...and I'm debating on getting another pair because I heard calmer is another good pair but yea", "Oh I am QUITE familiar with that. We get the Kiwi tax here :p. It makes importing or exporting on small scale a nightmare.  One of the biggest reasons a number of nz businesses can't afford to go international.  Who in their right mind would pay $35 in shipping for a $10 trinket?", "Heh, that's what I get for not looking at user names. \n\nYep. It's bloody mental."]}
