You can also teach your kids to self advocate by assertively telling them to \u201cstop\u201d or they don\u2019t like how they are playing but in general- walking away is a good habit for them to get into when they don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening around them-", "Who cares if she thinks You are a jerk.

Even adults need moments away even just to check their phone. \n\nAnimals do it. Dogs will leave play groups when over stimulated, birds will return to their nest, cats will nap. Humans can do it too. \n\nPerhaps you should have a talk with your wife about this and bring it up. Actually use the words over stimulation and try to think about anytime you/her have been in a overly loud engaging environment and needed a quick break. This situation may just require both of you to be informed when the kids take a basement break so she understands they just need a moment to themselves. \n\nIm sure there were times when mom wanted mom time from screaming kids, or dad needed dad time.
