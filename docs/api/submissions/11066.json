They should have a say in it too.", "I kinda disagree that the wife is TA here. She tried once to get her family together, to get her kids together with their cousins. Now, if the cousins misbehaved and OP's wife shouted at her kids and let the cousins' behaviour slide, she would be TA. But it looks like she didn't punish her own children, and directed her anger at the right person - her sister who has not taught her children any manners. And doesn't look like she called OP the asshole either. Yes, the wife learnt her lesson. But she wasn't wrong in trying once as long as she accepted her failure and made the necessary reparations.\n\nOP, NTA for sure. You were just looking out for your kids. You did well.", "This. While not exactly the same, when I was a kid, my mom often pushed me to socialize with peers and kids of family friends who didn\u2019t like me because I was weird (not disruptive, just liked drawing and manga).

I definitely run referee in my own house no matter whose kids are over. Kids fighting with their cousins; call them out, redirect, teach your kids to stand up for themselves, tell your niblings you don\u2019t allow that kind of behavior in your home. Sounds like your SIL could also use the \u201cparenting by example\u201d lesson this would show and if she feels some kind of way about it, you talk through your differences and set boundaries just like you want to model for your kids. Yes, sometimes having a place to retreat to when overwhelmed is a necessity, but it can\u2019t be the _only_ coping strategy you give them. Seems like there is a lot of middle ground between \u201cretreat to the cave,\u201d and \u201clet them run buck wild.\u201d Find the middle ground!", "I am NOT anti-social. But a LOT of my family are racist misogynistic A-holes. So, I read books.  Because listing to morons spout racist misogyny for morons I had no respect for? Was not going to go well. I read a book out of respect for my mom- because she would be the one that caught hell when I ripped these morons to shreds. I know because sometimes my strategy did not work, and eventually I would tell them how freaking stupid they were. It was no hard to make them look foolish. Let me alone to read, or pay the price in humiliation when I rip you apart in front of your wife and kids, because I am smarter than you dumbass. And that does not mean I am super smart- just that they were that damn dumb.", "Yup, always had a sci-fi paperback with me at gatherings.  It did lead to my uncle introducing me to several of my fave books including A Canticle for Leibowitz.", "People are going to be what they'll be. Forcing kids into unpleasant social situations because \"they're faaaamily\" doesn't turn them into social butterflies, it just reinforces that their relatives are awful. Yes, there's something to be said for learning social graces etc, the problem is that it's coming at the expense of giving the kids a safe place to retreat to when things become too much.", "When I tell you my world collapsed a bit when I learned my obsessive reading as a child was how I dealt with trauma...whooo that was a hard day in therapy", "OMG, this is my family dynamic to a frighteningly accurate level! I only hold my tongue for the sake of my mom\u2019s feelings and her relationships with these people.", "Right, but we don't have any specific scale here. Are kids disappearing right after saying hello, or are they hanging with the cousins for 2 hours before locking themselves away? The former is not okay for parents to let a 9 or 10 year old be doing, and letting the 12 year old do it just means you are telling the 9 and 10 year old that its acceptable. The latter is beyond fine, and I would say the wife absolutely would be TA if that is the case. It also depends on if the kids are allowed to use the upstairs PS4 when guests are over, or if the console is in the same room that the adults are hanging out in. If its the latter there, then its absolutely not appropriate for kids to lock themselves in the room with the only available consoles when guests are over.\n\nThat being said, I especially do not think the wife is TA here because of her immediate reaction of standing up for her family and putting the blame where it belongs (on SIL and her husband).1", "All of this.  NTA, and maybe OP's wife should acquaint herself with the actual definition of 'antisocial'.  Antisocial isn't just 'not sociable', it's actively destructive.  It sounds like your SIL is raising her kids to be far closer to that definition than you both are raising yours.", "Yeah, that sounds pretty stellar. I'm all about the companionable silences. Which is weird, because I also am a frequent oversharer and sometimes can't shut up.", "I used reading as a coping mechanism. I just get so addicted that I get sucked into the plots \ud83e\udd23", "Yes!!! \ud83d\udc9e", "Oh my god. I didn\u2019t want to dump my trauma on people but i actually used reading to escape. It\u2019s like my mind wasn\u2019t on real life, I was deep in the books. I also learned from my therapist that I know how to disassociate. I was like what!", "OP said that the kids love their cousins and that they have permission to use the room when their cousins become too much. That sounds like a) they spend enough time with their cousins to have that sort of bond, and b) like the room isn't a 24/7 until the cousins leave thing. Just a safe space for when they need a breather. That all sounds pretty healthy and well adjusted to me.", "Of course! Welcome!", "Same!", "Are you me? I'm in the middle of my 'generation' of cousins (we've got some that came along much later and are only now teens while the rest of us are 35-40 and some *have* teens), and I'm the only one of the group not to ever have been married, and nearly the only one to not have any kids.

What you were actually teaching your kids is boundaries. I expect your wife learned a potent lesson that day.", "NTA. Flat out you and your wife need to set household rules for your kids and cousins to follow when they come over and the consequences.  Give them to your wife\u2019s sister before they come over and tell her all adults will be enforcing the discipline for all the kids.", "Good for you for providing your kids with a panic room. Mine used to force me out of my room when they threw huge family gatherings VERY often. I hated being around people because I was chubby ( still am) and most adults would make fun of me and ask when I\u2019m gonna go on a diet. \n\nStand up for your kids because they\u2019re still finding their voice to stand up to themselves. They need their parents to help them find that voice that way when they\u2019re older they can feel more comfortable using their own voice to stand up for themselves.", "NTA she got what she asked for. Their parents are looking for anyone to blame but themselves.", "NTA\n\nIf I had someone bringing their kids over that are AH, family or not, and my kids didn't want to be around them then I wouldn't force it either. Moreover, I agree with your wife about telling the other parent that their kids need to be better behaved if they're going to come over. I don't care whose house you're in, you need to be respectful and if kids are old enough to be able to understand that concept, then parents need to reinforce it.", "NTA, but I just wouldn\u2019t let them visit. Easy for me to say as a complete stranger to the situation but\u2026If your kids feel they need to lock themselves in the room, maybe you shouldn\u2019t let the chaos through their front door in the first place.", "NTA. Apparently it\u2019s out of hand enough to warrant that, odd though it is. Wife and sister dragging you into something, not sure about that.", "NTA- even if they weren\u2019t little headaches, your kids do need space to decompress. Family meetups are very stressful.", ">Now my sister-in-law is calling me an asshole for turning her sister against her. I can't win. If I let the kids hide I'm the asshole. If I let the kids go crazy with their cousins I'm the asshole. If my wife finally sees that her niblings are out of control monsters and tells her sister to control them I'm the asshole.\n\nMore of a philosophical question: are you really an AH if both of those people calling you that are, in fact, AHs? Does that make you an Anti-AH? A reverso-AH?  Cuz from my chair, your wife and her family are the AHs.  White pill: at least your wife now seems to realize it.", "Having lived this for many years because various family members have the same attitude & bratty kids, I truly feel for you. 1 family members kids were absolute brats, not disciplined & although my kids were older, they were tired of constantly being jumped on & basically attacked. I mean, these kids were wild. Gave my kids permission to stay away whenever we were all together, because they\u2019d feel bad & endure it because they\u2019d feel guilty. \nSo we came up with the policy is, our house, our rules & they go for all, my kids & yours, especially when it comes to safety & manners. If your child is misbehaving, the parents have the choice to make sure their kids follow them or they can take them home.", "Info: What exactly makes the cousins \"brats\" ?", "You are the one putting yourself in this situation.

He was very sneaky about it, so I learned to stay away from him & my AH brother who\u2019d team up w/him. Both are still total AH\u2019s, (bro is now NC w/the entire family), but now, whenever I see my cousin, I (and his sister) totally give him crap whenever he starts up & since we\u2019re 100x smarter, oh, we can now make his head spin\ud83e\udd23", "Agreed! Ours is Autistic and  we always encourage her to take some quiet time away or sensory breaks if she\u2019s feeling overstimulated or just needs a minute.

They internalise that they are in control of their social situations and will allow themselves more socially risky behaviour.\n\nThe opposite is what you are suggesting. Refusing them the opportunity to make boundaries teaches them that social situations are inherently unsafe because they lack control. They will avoid social situations.", "Wait. Are you me?! I knit and listen to audiobooks constantly. I stopped going to family gatherings years ago because I would rather read and ignore the gossip/drama. Now that the family has gotten older and the cousins started having kids there is no freaking way I would be part of the gatherings. Their kids are out of control, back talk, wild little heathens and I refuse to deal with it.", "That's depressing - my Nana used to ask what I was reading and try and keep up ... which, given that a) I was reading mostly Sci-Fi and b) was going through two to three books (proper, 300+page books) a week meant she was always asking about a book I'd finished. But she TRIED, and my aunts and uncles, who didn't much get it, TRIED. My uncle once ran around three days before Christmas to LITERALLY 15 bookstores (this was in the early '90s) to try and find me a copy of a book by an author I loved that had just been released. He did - and it ended up pushed into the water tray of the Christmas tree by all the other gifts, and was TOTALLY waterlogged. I dried it out (took a week!) and you know, I still had it when we cleaned out my folks' house a year or two ago. It was in remarkably good shape, all things considered.", "I\u2019m with you!
