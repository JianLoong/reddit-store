Some people think there's a requirement that kids *must* get along with others, but just as we adults don't get along with everyone, kids don't need to either. I'm generally curious, how are your kids around other people? Are they generally social? They are only antisocial, if that's a broadly general trend across all groups of friends. I also will say, forcing your kids to be social can also be toxic. I'm on the spectrum, and know many other individuals who are autistic, especially as children, where quiet time like that is extremely important (otherwise, it can push them towards a meltdown), alot of them are often dismissed as kids for being antisocial for that very reason, and grow up struggling to properly handle there meltdowns (because the masking they do, directly compromises their ability to self regulate). Not saying your kids are on the spectrum, but generally speaking everyone's needs are there own to set, and it varys broadly.\n\nYour sister in law sounds immature, your wife is communicating her feelings, and she's instead blaming you for them.

The ban on SIL should stand until she proves she can rein in her kid's behavior at your home.  You can tell it's bad when even other children of similar ages want nothing to do with it and want to escape.  Until then, the kids can meet at a park or some other location to play so you can see if there is any actual effort being put in to keep them under control by thier mom.  \n\nUntil then, you and your wife need to be firm and united against SIL.  Particularly your wife. She needs to tell her sister to address -her- if she's going to send these hateful messages since it was her decision.  SIL going behind her back to yell at you and blame you is unacceptable.
