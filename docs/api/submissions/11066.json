Your wife is. She should have trusted your judgement.

My Dad let me do that as well when he would have company over that I didn't want to see and even when I just wanted my alone time away from him. I turned out just fine. People and kids are allowed to have boundaries.", "NTA in general I think it\u2019s a great practice to teach kids they can remove themselves from situations they are uncomfortable with or recognize signs of things getting out of hand. You can also teach your kids to self advocate by assertively telling them to \u201cstop\u201d or they don\u2019t like how they are playing but in general- walking away is a good habit for them to get into when they don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening around them-", "Who cares if she thinks You are a jerk.  Your wife saw it and put her foot down.  Let her deal with her family.

As an intense introvert, I applaud you.", "NTA i think if you let them in the basement your wife isnt going to be upset anymore. She just needed to see that you were regulating the situation in a healthy way.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how people assume that children arent like us adults. Children can and should be able to self regulate themselves in social situations. Not everyones a \u201cparty\u201d animal so to speak ans can handle hours upon hours of people, noises and stimulation. Even adults need moments away even just to check their phone. \n\nAnimals do it. Dogs will leave play groups when over stimulated, birds will return to their nest, cats will nap. Humans can do it too. \n\nPerhaps you should have a talk with your wife about this and bring it up. Actually use the words over stimulation and try to think about anytime you/her have been in a overly loud engaging environment and needed a quick break. This situation may just require both of you to be informed when the kids take a basement break so she understands they just need a moment to themselves. \n\nIm sure there were times when mom wanted mom time from screaming kids, or dad needed dad time. Kids deserve their time too. \n\nIts not \u201chiding\u201d its self care.", "NTA.

Then they'd have to blame themselves. Which I doubt will happen. Good on you for being good parent to allow a space for cooling down.\n\nIf you wanna blow things up though you could tell SIL that you were just doing what your wife thought was good. Since both of you are the parents. Plus \"Happy wife, Happy life.\" May as well get some use out of the BS saying. But that means your wife and SIL will clash more and nine times out of ten it will just be blamed on you. So not suggested but is an option for some fireworks.", "NTA\n\nIt would be nice if you had a chat with your kids about standing their ground, they ideally shouldn\u2019t have to hide in their own home. I think your wife\u2019s comments to your SIL were the correct answer: they\u2019re kids, the adults are who should be held responsible.\n\nAlso that person saying you should\u2019ve \u201cdisciplined them yourself\u201d sounds delusional. Their own parents don\u2019t discipline them, they wouldn\u2019t like you doing it either lol", "NTA - and the episode of Bluey my toddler was watching last night was literally about this, so even he thinks you're NTA (at least based on how it was resolved on Bluey)", "ESH. That was a ridiculous 'solution' for you to offer, and an awful thing to teach your kids about conflict (just go run and hide). Did you go lock yourself in there too?\n\n12/10/9 are not toddlers.  Your nephews/nieces are old enough to behave, and under your roof you and your wife should be telling them as much *directly* instead of letting your SIL handle it.", "I feel like there's a lot of missing info here", "NTA you shouldn't force your children to interact with people. You are teaching your children you will respect their boundaries and comfort even with \"family\". Too often we force children to put up with the bad behavior of others and those lessons carry into more adult situations later in life.", "NTA\n\nyou're allowed to have boundaries for behavior in your own home.\n\nIf your SIL is having a problem with this, why not visit in her home and let the carnage be hers to deal with.", "NTA. \n\nI think it's great to teach your kids they can remove themselves from social situations they don't want to be in. It's also great that you listened to your wife's perspective and tried a different way to see if it would work better. \n\nWhat's not great is her sister blaming you for the fallout of her kids atrocious behavior. Also not great is your wife's refusal to accept her niblings' inability to behave before the mysterious string of disasters. You did all you could, now those with less careful actions are becoming well acquainted with their consequences.", "NTA. Your wife got exactly what she asked for. Family time. My family went to visit my uncle's house about 38 years ago. I didn't want to hang out with my cousin because he was kind of a jerk and a bully. My dad made me.

They're at *your house.* Tell the kids yourself to behave.  If they essentially give you the middle finger or your SIL tries to fight their corner, show all of them the door.\n\nYou and your wife are adults and this is your house, so get control of your own scene. Letting shit happen and telling your kids to run and hide is a ridiculous way to deal with the problem.", "Actually it sounds like op is teaching his kids that its okay to leave a situation thats not good for you. That is very important."]}
