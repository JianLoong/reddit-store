I say, don\u2019t give him the gift this year and only give him the gift next year if he apologizes this year (because it doesn\u2019t seem like he has). If he complains about not getting a gift this year tell him you got him nothing because you didn\u2019t want to risk giving him something tacky.", "NTA get him a generic tie. And get your sister something only she can use. No one in that household should get preserves.", "NTA, and did the record, there is nothing tacky or trashy about your gift. I\u2019d be ecstatic to get homemade jam.", "NTA, I would love to have you in my life. Your gifts sound amazing!", "NTA\n\nif he liked it so much he could have told you along with an apology", "NTA. Don't give them to him, how ridiculously rude.", "INFO I can\u2019t help but ask, did he elaborate about what exactly is trashy and tacky about homemade preserves? Because it\u2019s also a business for you?", "Kevin doesn't want trashy gifts. Fuck him..passoutpierce does. I'll trade you a jar for my home made hotsauce.", "YWNBTA if you made fruit preserves for everyone but gave him socks. Fruit of the Loom brand so everyone technically gets fruit.", "don't give him anything and when he asks say \"Oh, well last year you said they were tacky and trashy so I just didn't bother\" in the most innocent way and if you really wanna up it maybe get him a card for Christmas I've had one of the same things happen to me and this really got them", "NTA. Give him some Smuckers. And send some of those jars this way :)", "Try faking nit bringing any, but take a backup if he admits he was sorry and likes it. You can say that you weren\u2019t sure if he liked them after he complained last year (calling him out) so you brought some just in case he wanted some.", "Why would that seem petty?  He let you know he disliked your gift so much he had to let you know. You, being very solicitous of his sensitivities will give him a gift card or something.  You can do this solely to bring him joy and not repeat his suffering of last year; poor baby.\n\nBTW, what did he give you last year?", "Give him a box of tacks.", "NTA. Kevin needs a cheap tie.", "NTA \n\nHe was unhappy with your gift, so he gets nothing.", "NTA. I really don't think your BIL and sister deserve a gift from you this year, but if you feel you must give them something, I'd give them a few jars of very basic supermarket jams / preserves. That way they aren't being rewarded for being AHs, it's a gift that is sort of the same (maybe better if you don't like homemade stuff?), and no one can accuse you of leaving them out.", "NTA. Don't give him anything.", "NTA\n\nDon't.gift.him.anything.ever.  Give your sister a gift he can't use or eat.  I would just get something from dollar tree since she didn't set him straight when he complained in front of your family!  (Giving your sister the side eye).", "NTA\n\nThis year give him a book about manners.\n\neta:  or pink flamingos or a black velvet Elvis picture so he can see what is really tacky.  And going forward have fun finding him the tackiest possible present.", "NTA, gift that sucker Smuckers.", "NTA\n\nI think homemade jams are a thoughtful gift. You should give them some store bought jams that have had the labels removed.", "Not just that - if OP gifts the sister fruit preserve, guess who will eat it out of the common fridge? \n\nCome up with a different for both sister and BIL. She didn\u2019t tell her husband off at the time so they can both make do without it this year. \n\nAs a last point: great hobby OP, sounds both fun and delicious!", "Might be better to get him a generic store bought item that has no real thought behind it. I usually make gifts for gifting occasions. My BIL's girlfriend said that just for once she'd like something that came from a store so that's what I started doing. I've actually gotten my work in galleries now but still give her 1 store bought item, now she's unhappy about that\ud83e\udd2b", "Give him socks", "Or OP should gift him some meaningless item, such as chocolates or shower soap.", "This is such a good idea!", "His BEHAVIOR was tacky and trashy.", "One pair of cheap bright socks, preferably in the wrong size and from a petrol station.", "I love this answer so much I actually went and got my free award to gift away for the first time in months. GMA was a savage; love it!!\n\nOP- NTA. BiL made it clear to you he didn\u2019t want your preserves so don\u2019t give them to him anymore. Ever. Lol", "I cackled at \u201cheart bypass\u201d. Never thought I\u2019d say that.", "I love your grandmother! \n\nOne time my uncle told my grandmother he was joining a dinner he hadn\u2019t been invited to join. She made French bread, lamb, and artichokes - to which my uncle said \u201cI don\u2019t like roast and artichoke.\u201d Grandma smiled politely and responded \u201cI know.\u201d", "THIS! I love it.", "No. Not giving him anything is mature and reasonable.\n\nGiving him a gift wrapped box of tacks, now that\u2019s petty.", "My parents give me both every year, and I love them \ud83d\ude02 They are fancy Darn Tough socks, though.", "Nah, he could actually use it then. Get him a $10 gift card to a shop where the cheapest item is $100.", "She didn\u2019t reacted to her husband belittling OP in front of the whole family. No jams nor preserves for her neither.", "Socks are too nice of a gift for an AH like Kevin. Give him prunes.", "This is the only answer. I mean... I'd love socks for Christmas, but it's a delightfully generic gift!", "Thank you. Can you imagine? My grandmother was an embodiment of style and class. She would have warmly accepted a handmade gift and truly enjoyed it.", "I\u2019m thinking a book on canning perhaps.", "I'm curious: What did the rest of your family say?  Because if this happened in front of my family they would have piled on right away and then proceed to spend the entire year talking smack about him, probably to his face.  \n\nDon't give this guy another damn thing, and don't give your sister preserves either because then he will still probably be benefiting from the literal fruits of your labor.  Get her something only *she* can use. Unacceptably rude behavior from your BIL and you are definitely NTA.", "This is what coal and the aforementioned $10 gift cards are for.", "This one is the best come back gift to his tacky comments.", "Just not the blue ball book!", "I'm so happy that other people know about this book. And they still kind of are! Also, along these lines, my mom bought my always grumpy/cranky/dickish uncle a book called something like, 1000 reasons to be happy today.  I think he might have eventually cracked a smile, but I doubt it.", "My favorite colour is petty.", "Kevin sounds like he'd be hypocritical enough to eat them and not say anything about it. However, I see your point. They both do not deserve homemade jam."]}
