Don't give him anything and continue to give your family your lovely preserves or anything else you want to give them.", "NTA, his attitude is tacky.", "Give him two and say, \"since you liked them so much last year\".", "Get a generic brand of jam from the store and give that to him.   And nothing else.", "The family didn\u2019t say anything to him? \n\nNta.Get him a card.", "NTA but Kevin will not complain again once he has tasted your preserves. My sister tossed aside my homemade sweet chilli sauce for the gross, sugary store bought one. She ate it 2 years later because she ran out of store bought. Been bugging me to make more ever since.", "NTA.  \n\n\nHad I received that comment, I'd have scratched him off the list and had no qualms stating why. If anything, a piece of coal or charcoal should suffice. I'm sure someone you know has a charcoal grill and could spare a piece. Or a donation in their name.   \n\n\nAnd, personally, I keep my distance of people that scoff at handmade and homemade gifts.", "NTA at all.  Anyone who complained about a gift I gave them, that would be the last gift they\u2019ve ever received from me.  It might also be the last time I ever talked to them.", "NTA. \n\nBut this year give him AXE/LYNX body spray.", "NTA.\n\nYou gave a gift that you knew everyone liked, and he complained about it in front of the whole family?? What a complete jerk! Then he eats and actually compliments that gift as if nothing happened? Double jerk!\n\nHome made gifts are amazing. So much love and effort goes into them. Heck, any gift that requires real *work* is amazing! It doesn't matter if that hard work comes in the form of finding something rare, getting something that's hard to transport, learning about a subject you have no interest in so you can choose the right thing, or making something entirely from scratch.\n\nI would still give your preserves to your sister, though I'd make it clear she should step in and shut him down if he tries to complain. I'd then get him the most thoughtless, stereotypical gift I could find. One of those 'men's bath sets', or a tiny bottle of whisky that comes with a golf ball and a single tee, (Extra credit if he doesn't even play!). The type of thing you see in stacks near the entrance to a supermarket. If he complains about it: \"It's all I could think of that wasn't handmade, and I know you hate handmade.\"\n\nI say all this as someone who doesn't like/is allergic to most preserves. I can still appreciate the work that goes into them!", "NO jam for either of them.  Ever", "I would give everyone else the fruit preserves and get him some socks make sure the ones you give your sister she likes and he doesn't", "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND DELICIOUS JAM ON THAT PB&ASSHOLE. NTA. Send me his jams instead because I would be SO EXCITED to receive something so thoughtful and tasty!", "Wbta if you don\u2019t give him something else. If he makes the comments again bring up that he said it was tacky. But mind you he is also in the wrong for complaining in the first place.", "Hello Kevin please come and prove YTA at your first family Christmas, please complain about the thoughtful homemade gift you received and enjoyed. YWNBTA if Kevin the grinch got nothing", "NTA \n\nDo not give him the gift of your time, your skill, your effort.  Get a $5 super generic gift of chocolate or biscuits and give him that. Or a gift card.\n\nDon't even spend time agonising over it.\n\nI would suggest that you check in with your sister to ask her if she has an issue with preserves and would she prefer something else from you?  This guy was rude but I wonder if he was reflecting something she has said to him?\n\n\nAlso check in with the rest of your family to see if they are still happy to accept these food gifts too...   I expect they will be, but there's no harm to check from time to time.", "NTA. Your sister said Kevin enjoyed eating the things you made, but I'm guessing *he's* never said that to you or apologised for berating you last year over your choice of gift *in front of your whole family* (an act even tackier than if he had been correct about the tackiness of hand-made gifts - which for the record, he wasn't!). So go ahead and assume that he still feels that way, since he hasn't told you anything to the contrary. After all, enjoying eating something doesn't mean you want to get it as a gift.\n\nYour sister can have her one-person-sized set of preserves gift as normal - he doesn't take that away from her - as can the rest of the family. \n\nKevin can be given a neutral present if you don't know him well or a book off his Amazon Wishlist or something. It's not a punishment, and it's not petty; it's pragmatic and accepting his feelings and choices to the best of your knowledge.", "NTA, Why tf would you give him any after he insulted and embarrassed you in front of the family. Give everyone else their jars and if he complains remind him he thought they were too trashy to be gifts so you've spared him.", "Gift voucher for him (if you feel like getting him anything at all) and makeup or fancy body lotion stuff for your sister. No jam, cis he'd eat it. Problem solved.\n\nNTA but he's a waste of oxygen.", "NTA\n\nIt's shxxt but I want more...\n\nHe is the childish one and without any educationand that on christmas", "NTA.\n\nI would be thrilled if someone took the time to MAKE a gift for me!  \n\nPersonally, I'd buy the cheapest, generic brand of preserves and put my label on it.  \n\nI can be petty...", "NTA. It wouldn't even be petty of you. He complained about the gift, why would you even consider giving him anything this year???", "Hell no. If he complains because he later realized how good they were, hand him your business card and tell him how he can order and pay for them. Like a regular customer. NTA", "NTA. I would 100% love homemade marmalade and preserves as a gift.", "NTA I wouldn't get your BIL or your sister anything. Him because he called your thoughtful gifts were \"tacky\" and then still ate them. And your sister doesn't deserve anything either because she should have had a go at him for insulting you.", "NTA. I wouldn't give him a damn thing.", "NTA. He said he didn't like them. It's not petty or a punishment not to get him something he doesn't want. It might be petty to get him a gift card to a gas station or something equally impersonal.  So definitely don't do that...", "NTA. In fact it would be \u201crude\u201d of you to give him a present he has publicly announced he thinks is tacky and trashy. Let him experience the consequences of his own actions.", "Get him a box of thumb tacks and be done with that douchcanoe.", "NTA. I suggest gifting him socks.", "NTA, i'd give everyone an extra large amount of fruity goodness, and gift him a pair of socks.", "NTA\n\nBut I am appalled that no one in your family immediately turned him around. How does a grown adult who is new to the family come off with something this rude and condescending without anyone bringing him up short? Your entire family let you down.\n\nPreserves are one of the most thoughtful gifts imaginable because so few people have the skill, time and resources to make their own preserves and they are so much better than what you buy at the store.\n\nLet me tell you what I think is going on here. Kevin has picked what he perceives to be the meekest person in your family and singled you out for poor treatment as a sounding board. He's learned that wife didn't speak up for her own sister, nor did any member of your family. My best guess is that no matter what you buy him in the future, barring expensive gaming systems and such, is going to be met with some level of complaining. It's his way of asserting himself.\n\nSince you already know that your own family won't stand up for you, literally your only recourse is to purchase him a book on manners, wrap it up and the minute he opens his mouth to complain, you raise your hand and say, \"Absolutely not. I don't want to hear one word of complaint from you after your incredibly rude behavior last year. You're not a child. Calling another person's gift trashy communicated to me that you clearly don't understand appropriate social behavior. This is me getting you what you need instead of what you want. You can thank me later, when you've had a chance to really think about what just happened.\"\n\nThe minute your family objects, ask them where their head was last year when he was incredibly rude to you and they said nothing. Remind them that's not how they raised you and your sister to behave. Leave if you have to. You have to teach brother in law that he will not spend a lifetime walking all over you. Maybe, give him the link to this AITA so he can see how out of bounds his behavior was.", "Nta. Please by them the grossest looking fruitcake you can find. Nothing against the fruitcake. Just seasonally appropriate food and giving it to him seems appropriate to me.", "ESH he was rude and tacky for what he said and how he said it because no one is entitled to a present. However, my exact thought when I read you essentially just give family stuff you have on hand from the business and don\u2019t even bother to get them things they like was wow that\u2019s tacky. It is. If you\u2019re going to give a gift it should be somewhat thoughtful regardless if it was free or super expensive. You put no thought into the gift and give everyone the same thing because it\u2019s easy and convenient. Do they reciprocate with thoughtful gifts based around things you actually like and not just what\u2019s convenient", "Buy him some jam from a poundstore. Wait for him to complain its not your \"good jam\". Apologise and explain you thought he wanted shop bought gifts because homemade ones are tacky. Then go home, eat jam and smile cos the guy can't have it both ways .  \n\n Petty?     Yup.     Petty damn good that is :)", "Gift him your business card. He can buy your jams in future. Just that and nothing else. NTA", "Damn right, give homemade and ungrateful people don\u2019t get a repeat gift from us!", "If you give him nothing, he may assume you forgot him. Instead, give him a small, token gift --- even a Christmas card, small ornament, etc. That way, he'll know you didn't forget him, but rather made a conscious choice not to give the jams.", ">\"Nothing says \u201cdie\u201d quite like a kfc gift card after heart surgery.\"  \n>  \n>This made me LAUGH! Then I got to the beets and pickled okra comment.   \n>  \n>How I loathe beets!", "Your grandmother is a rockstar and clearly she taught you well. You are the recipient of my first award. Thank you for the ideas!", "Omg I love your grandma.", "If it were me and someone apologized sincerely, I would not continue to hold a grudge.", "Wow. Grandma was a legend and you learned a lot from her!", "Your Grandma is now my hero too.", "If he\u2019s a non iPhone user get him a $10 iTunes card.", "He didn't humiliate you. He humiliated himself but just didn't realise.  You are awesome.", "Like plain white gym socks.", "A generic \"world's best brother-in-law\" mug would be hilarious.", "I'd give her a WM or grocery store gift card.\n\nPeople like her SUCK the joy out of Christmas.", "Yup, I do the same, people who appreciate the time, money and effort that goes into homemade, get homemade. The rest get generic scented candles etc", "I was thinking something like a candle.  A non-scented candle.", "Chocolate covered cherries.  \nPerfect gift for someone you dislike.", "Soap on a rope", "This gets my vote! \ud83d\ude02", "I didn't know there was such a thing. Thank you for making me check to see if I had one too because I also LOVE grandma and her pettiness. She's an artist.", "I'm in the middle of making homemade peanut butter cups. Dead easy, if time consuming with the molds, but sooooo good. All my family appreciates they things I make. If one year they say they're off that thing, I say good to know and give something different next year. 'Cause peoples tastes change, but none of us are dicks. NTA.", "Wow. That's incredibly rude. Who the hell complains about a homemade gift. \n\nNot getting him a gift would be justified, but he'd probably be able to spin it as you being rude. Get him a generic gift from Amazon/target that's under $20. One of those cheap scarf hat combos or whatever cheap things they sell now a days. Don't think about it for more than a minute. \nIf he complains about being the only person not getting delicious jams,  Tell him he made it very clear he did not want to receive those as a gift and you'll be sure to never gift him jam again. If he says he likes then direct him to the website.", ">He was complaining about the gift itself.\n\nBecause it was homemade? Or because it was food?\n\nHow did your sister react?", "Did your sister not defend you? Or at least tell him those comments were extremely rude???", "I'm boring, if someone got me an Aldi voucher I'd be straight up thrilled.", "Best part is OP could obtain both in one trip to the dollar store.", "That's right! Wouldn't want to offend him with a scent he didn't like.", "I might go a different route that involves charities.\n\nFind out what causes or interests Kevin supports, and donate in his name to one of them.  OP could give a card that notes she donated their preserves for a local auction or charity, or she will donate the earnings she makes from selling their preserves online, as she realized he did not like her gift, and she figured this would be a win/win for everyone.\n\nKevin can't say a thing about this, including that he was excluded from gifts.  He wouldn't be excluded, as his share will be sold and help people in his name.", "Comment stolen from u/SendmetoFinland\n\nu/zookeepergameIcy3439 is a bot.", "One of the Miss Manners books.", "My mum gave me a book called \u2018how to make friends\u2019 after I opened up to her about being severely bullied in high school. She still doesn\u2019t understand why that made me upset. For her it\u2019s a cute anecdote. I\u2019m still annoyed 20 years later. Ugh", "I love this idea! It sounds like you put a lot into making the preserves. You could even bring a donation of the actual jams to a Women\u2019s shelter with an assortment of breads in his name. Then gift him a nice card explaining the donation in his name. I think your gifts are amazing, yummy and a show of love with the time and effort you put in. NTA. INFO\u2014did your sister or anyone straighten him out last year when this happened???", "Somehow I feel Kevin would find a way to complain about a donation being a trashy gift too. He doesn\u2019t seem to have much understanding of the social operation here.", "This is a great solution!", "You are an evil genius.", "Do you mean Adult \u2018Pull-ups?\u2019  \ud83d\ude02", "This is a good idea. My sister was grumpy when our grandmother stocked her up in thick pads for a baby shower gift, and later said that it was the best and most thoughtful gift she was given as an expectant and then post partum mother.\n\nETA: NTA. My brother does the same thing with home canned goods, and I look forward to it every year. Best apple butter and pickles in the world.", "Padcicles.\n\nFunny, yet very practicle.", "I really like this idea, too. Kevin never even tried to set things right or thank OP for the gift after acting like an AH about it, but let sister do that for him. But I definitely think he wouldn\u2019t be happy with a donation to charity but can\u2019t really say anything about it, and if he does, the family probably won\u2019t think well of him for it.\n\nHomemade jam is an awesome gift, especially from someone who does it well!", "I started my cycle in about 1990, and I remember those terrible pads. They shifted position, made an imprint in snug pants, and RUSTLED. \n\nThey might be useful in a first aid kit, though. Bless that old lady who tried to help."]}
