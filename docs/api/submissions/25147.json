During my life with my dad i really picked myself up, my dad was really who i needed. Just within months he taught me how to drive and i got my license, i got a nice job, i picked myself up and especially focused on how i presented myself, losing weight and being a perfectionist when it comes to every aspect of my appearance. \n\nMy grandma\u2019s birthday was a few days ago, my step-grandpa invited me to dinner. He is the only person im currently in contact with and i see him as my real grandfather, so i agreed to deal with being in proximity with my mom so i can make him happy.\n\nWhen i got there a lot of my family was there including my mom, i instantly felt uncomfortable. They kept trying to hug me as if they didn\u2019t treat me awfully and were offended when i pulled away and told them, specifically my mom, to not touch me. My mom became confrontational and was passive aggressively talking crap about my father and how he \u201cmanipulated\u201d me and told me i backstabbed her. I got pissed off but stayed civil until she made a comment about my appearance (which she always degraded me for) asking me if im still constantly ordering doordash and eating like a pig. I got defensive and of course ran my mouth, i told her she used ozempic to the point of looking like a tweaker and got a nose job and lip filler yet her face is still busted, added in the only reason why she acts like that towards me is because she is jealous and knows i will always be significantly more attractive than her. I left right after that because i knew if i stayed in the room with her i would have lost it and someone was gonna get folded. I didn\u2019t tell my dad yet because i know hes going to be disappointed and i hate bashing on physical appearance because i know how it feels like and i don\u2019t want to be like my mother.
