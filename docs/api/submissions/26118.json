If so, she is the one being rude.\n\nIf your friend already knew that you were busy that day and chose that date for his birthday dinner regardless, it shows that it isn't such a big deal for him, or surely he would've picked a different date.", "NTA\n\nI usually celebrate my birthday on a day that's not my actual birthday. If there are people that I absolutely want there, I ask for their availability before making any arrangements.
