During college, she did internships, getting a few articles published in niche publications. After graduating, she joined a writing group. She even got paid for something she wrote once, which I thought would motivate her to continue trying to get published, but she never did and it's sad to see her wasting her potential.\n\nWhen her writing group disbanded, she never bothered finding another. She decided to focus only on fanfiction, which has been her hobby since middle school. I\u2019ve always been supportive of her writing fanfiction, and let her know that some authors have made millions by publishing popular fanfictions adapted into original fiction. I\u2019ve also urged her to continue pursuing her dream of writing original fiction; to attend classes and workshops in order to get feedback and improve her craft, so she can eventually get something published.\n\nBut she doesn't even want to try. She just wants to write fanficton for fun, not worrying about feedback, or improvement or getting published. She says she doesn't have the time and energy to devote to serious writing while working full-time.\n\nOne of my friends (40M) has been writing fanfiction even longer than she has. Recently, he has started using an AI and has found it helpful. IMO, this is no different than hiring an assistant. The AI writes and he edits it into what he wants, so he is able to put out a lot more, much faster.\n\nSo yesterday, I offhandedly suggested that my GF do the same because I thought it could also help her. She immediately blew up on me, saying that using an AI defeats the purpose of writing for fun because the actual writing is what she enjoys. I get that, but she got overly upset about it, screaming at me rude things like \"I don't care what your friend does, I'll never do that!\" and \"it's a stupid idea!\" instead of a simple \"no, thanks, not for me.\u201d She\u2019s always been very sensitive about her writing, which she admits.\n\nLater, she suggested I post this here to see which of us was right. She was confident it would be her, despite her emotional and extreme reaction.

She's an adult, she can decide her own career and actions.", "YTA.  People don't want unsolicited advice on how they should do their hobbies.  I don't think you were TRYING to be TA.

This isn't the most horrible transgression detailed on this sub even in the last hours but you still managed to suggest a robot that regurgitates remixes of other writers' works could do pretty much the same thing your girlfriend has put years of effort into as she honed her craft. It should be clear that her unique voice, talents, and the work she puts in are what's important to her about writing. The suggestion to use AI in an attempt to churn out more content was insulting to her and probably left her feeling misunderstood and taken for granted.\n\nIt's even more frustrating to enjoy something on your own, for yourself and have the people you love tell you how to make it your job. Like maybe she would want to write a novel but she already has a job. She likes making up stories and seems frustrated that she doesn't have time to write the stories. \"Why don't you make this a job that I will respect\" it's the support you think it is.", "She is writing for fun, not to curn out content.

It's not like she will lose her talent if she will not use it for money.\n\nLet's say she agrees with you, used AI, and earned a lot. Do you think that will make her happy? I think you are failing to understand why she does writing. You only see it as a tool for making money, hence why you are the AH.", "YTA, you clearly do not understand the concept of writing for fun. Let your girlfriend do what she does, and stop being so pushy.", "YTA, can\u2019t believe I\u2019m finally saying this on a post, but the Iranian yogurt is not the problem.

Stop trying to tell her what to do, stop trying to steal her joy.", "YTA stop telling her to write for profit not every hobby needs to be profitable. leave your gf alone to write in peace, also those of us who read fan fiction can def tell when it's written by an ai and won't read that.", "YTA. Not for suggesting an assistant of any kind, but for not listening to her. \n\nShe made it clear she does the writing just as a hobby so there is no need to take it any further, let alone by urging her to do so.\n\nThe case would be different if you were unaware of her being not that ambitious as she was before. In that case her reply might have been a bit rough, but depending on the situation, that might be just a spur of the moment.", "YTA. Hobbies can just be for fun.

We have a nasty habit in this society of trying to monetize everything, trying to turn all hobbies into streams of income.\n\nI am a fellow fan fiction writer. I can\u2019t even tell you the number of times people have asked me when I\u2019m going to start trying to write original fiction/get published/start a Patreon or Ko-fi, and the answer is never. This is my hobby. I do it because it is fun and I enjoy it. I don\u2019t ask for or accept constructive criticism from my readers because I am not writing it for them. I write fan fiction for me and choose to share it with them.\n\nYour girlfriend blew up at you because you are continually trying to turn a hobby she does for fun into a revenue stream. You consider writing fanfic as a \u201cwaste of potential,\u201d which is insulting, because she is clearly getting something intangible to you out of it.

Sounds like she is writing fanfiction as a hobby now and you are pressuring her to monetize it instead of letting her enjoy it. Try shutting the hell up and letting her have something she does for pleasure without trying to force her to make it a hustle.", "omg what? She just wants to write for fun and you're taking all the fun out of it. What's wrong with you? Not everything has to be for money. Leave your gf and her hobby alone. YTA", "YTA. Writing fanfiction is *fun*, and I've seen many a fanfic writer get completely burnt out chasing recognition instead of just enjoying the process. Leave her alone. She's enjoying her hobby, not everything needs to be successful or monetised to be worth doing.", "Enjoying writing and enjoying having written are two completely different things.", "You made a suggestion.  It wasn't a good suggestion.  It probably wasn't worded or presented well.  It was for a problem that is she doesn't see as grand as you do. You probably should have kept it to yourself.  I don't think you're an asshole tho. You were trying to be encouraging. She had an understandable reaction tho, so maybe revise your encouragement", "ESH - your friend who is using the AI is not writing fan fiction. He is essentially using a ghostwriter. \n\nWhy would you think it was a good suggestion to tell your girlfriend to stop doing her hobby she enjoys?", "EHS. I get that you\u2019re trying to support her, but it seems like she already told you that she would prefer writing just be a hobby. Not every passion has to be a career, and I get not wanting to turn it into something stressful.\n\n(Doesn\u2019t seem like her reasoning but I\u2019ll also add - a lot of writers and artists in particular don\u2019t support those kinds of AI programs because they steal work from small creators.)\n\nThat being said, she shouldn\u2019t have yelled over what seems like a genuinely small conflict.

Those AIs were likely trained on fanfiction without the author's permission (https://www.communicationstoday.co.in/ai-is-rewriting-the-rules-of-creativity-should-it-be-stopped/ and also it's very obvious in some of the generated text that they've scraped well known fan authors if you've read their work before.) I'm a fanfic writer myself and we are very aware and careful not to plagiarize other's work or even to use other's ideas without permission and credit. AO3 has a policy against direct plagiarism ( https://archiveofourown.org/tos?language_id=en#IV.E. ) that can get people banned from the platform. Using an AI that has a high probability of spitting out something that is recognizably someone else's work is not only unethical it could get your girlfriend in trouble with her community and her platforms. \n\nMore generally, the point of fan writing isn't to crank out content, it's an expression of love for the source material. It's a creative outlet. Using an AI would defeat the purpose.", "As someone who writes fanfiction\u2014YTA.\n\nAI is beginning to ruin a lot of things for artists and writers alike. Some of their works get outright stolen and people are plagiarising their works using these tools when publishing them, sometimes without even knowing. Plus AI writing implies that you have no real talent of your own. You basically told your SO that her writing sucks. That\u2019s how she perceived it, that\u2019s how literally 99% of authors would perceive it, especially fanfic writers. \n\nYou have no knowledge about the world of fanfiction and what it means to the people who dedicate their time to it, so by default, YTA.\n\nThose so-called authors you talked about who turned their fanfiction into books suck for the most part. They\u2019ve given fanfiction a bad name and they\u2019ve taken something they love and forced it to mould into something the public (mostly teenagers) want.\n\nLet her write however much and whatever she likes. Not everything needs to be used to make money, especially fanfiction. It\u2019s a huge insult to most fanfic writers when they hear from their families or friends that they should start thinking about publishing as to \u201cnot waste their time\u201d, and an even bigger one when they\u2019re told to use AI. \n\nCongrats on finding one author who didn\u2019t feel that way. Stop generalising it. I\u2019m in a couple of fanfic servers and letting an AI write for you has always been a taboo in all of them.", "YTA. Stop trying to control her. She doesn\u2019t want a career as a writer. And, though normally I would not support someone calling a partner\u2019s idea \u201cstupid,\u201d having AI doing the writing for her is indeed a stupid idea. Seriously?

I don't condone the outburst, but at least now you finally realize it's a sensitive subject for her. Maybe she did actually wanna pursue it in the past when she mentioned it in the beginning of the relationship, but your job isn't to push her to get there. It's to support her wether she chooses that path again later or not. Allow her to enjoy her hobby in peace. If you continue pushing her, I can see her resenting you later.

Like many writers, maybe she is focused on writing when she has the time _and_ inspiration, which helps her create quality work instead of a high quantity of work. \n\nHobbies don't need to have a measurable end goal - you can do things purely because you like doing them and improving a craft can manifest in different ways. For example, you like working out but does that mean you're always training for competitions, races, etc.? Probably not, as most people workout to improve themselves by their own internal standards instead of taking it to the maximum. \n\nIt seems like writing is a hobby your girlfriend genuinely enjoys and it provides a creative outlet for her.

I want to write because I have an idea for a story and I want to make it.\n\nSay I want to write a Marvel fanfiction about Bucky Barnes regaining his memory and joining the Avengers team. \n\nI have certain ideas to start with - an image, a couple of dialogues. I develope the story from that, I work out a coherent plot. Then I post it online. \n\nOf course, I love it when I get comments and praise online for my fic.

It's because you put making millions of dollars out there as a marker for what success means to you. Our society certainly uses money as a marker of success.

Good.  Instead, she should just be wildly popular online, huh? And to do so she should abandon her craft entirely, and use an AI so she can get enough renown so you think she's successful? \n\nWhat she is doing is what writers do- she is writing. As long as she is writing, she's improving her skills.  You're not interested in her writing skills though. If you were actually supportive of her efforts as a writer-   you wouldn't be recommending that she use AI to churn out the hits, get the likes,  receive praise and recognition!

If I plugged my idea into an AI, I'd get a story but there would be problems with the story (like it not being what I'm picturing in my head and it not fitting my style of writing) and I'd more than likely just end up rewriting most of it, defeating the purpose of using the AI.", "My reasoning is that if she did something she loved as her job, rather than the generic desk job she tolerates, then she would put more effort into advancing and eventually make more money through that hard work.", "She would create the prompt for the AI, so it would be her original idea.", "Everything else aside, you seem to have very little idea about writing or how to make money as an author.\n\nSure, some fanfic writers have managed to file off the serial numbers and publish it as an original work.

Most published authors still have day jobs; a VAST minority are making JK Rowling/EL James/GRRM/Brandon Sanderson money.
