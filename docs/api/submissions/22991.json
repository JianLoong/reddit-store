Thats insane to think you should pay \u201crent\u201d for renting nothing, yeah keep paying your phone but thats it.", "NTA.  Asking you to pay rent when you don't live there is an unreasonable expectation.  Also, if you don't want them holding the books and school supplies over your head, use what you would pay in rent to buy them yourself.", "NTA Of course you won't pay rent if you've moved out.    \nBut be careful about leaving anything valuable there. There have been many stories of kids leaving for college and coming home for break and finding out all their toys, books, games etc have been thrown out or donated. Make sure anything you care about is either with you or somewhere safe.", "NTA \n\nYou were paying rent for a reason, those extra expenses are no longer an issue. However I would absolutely pay for your share of the phone bill.", "NTA. Why does your dad expect you to keep paying rent though? A parent's responsibility is to care for their child, seems weird your dad would want to take money from you when you're finally going to go out on your own towards a path of being self sufficient.", "NTA. What are they *thinking*?\n\nAre they confused? Like do they think you're coming home every weekend or something? That's the only way this makes sense.", "NTA - This is textbook financial abuse on their part. Get your own phone plan and go your own way. Good luck in school!", "NTA.\n\nYou are correct. The rent you pay your parents (called \"board\" in many countries, including mine) covers your food, shelter, the electricity and water you use, and all the rest.\n\nIf you are not eating and sleeping under their roof any longer, there is no reason why you should be paying rent/board to them, and they are wrong to expect it.\n\nHowever, be prepared for these things to happen if you tell them you are no longer paying rent to them:\n\n1. If there is still a bedroom for you in their house, do not expect them to keep it there ready for you to use any time you want. Make sure all your personal belongings have been moved out of it, or they may get rid of your stuff without telling you. From now on, whenever you sleep under their roof again, you do so as a guest, not as a member of the household. If you are expecting them to preserve your old room exactly as it was when you last used it, and you expect to be able to stay there for extended periods during semester breaks, then you are being unreasonable, and you *should* be paying rent while you stay there.\n2. They may decide you can no longer be part of the family cellphone plan, since you are not a member of the household any longer.\n3. They may decide not to pay for any more school supplies that you need. They may use the argument that since you're now living independently, your study expenses are your responsibility.\n\nI doubt #2 and #3 will be a problem, since financially you should be coming out ahead, given you no longer have to pay rent to them. All I'm saying is, be prepared for it to happen, and if it does, you're going to have to suck it up.", "Nta. You don\u2019t pay for rent when you don\u2019t live somewhere.", "NTA. You don\u2019t pay rent on a place if you don\u2019t live there. And given your financial situation you shouldn\u2019t be subsidizing them.\n\nYou mention your dad is buying a house. Are they moving out of their current house and into a new one? You may want to move any belongings you have into storage- they could argue that since you no longer pay rent they won\u2019t keep (or move) your things.", "NTA. There is no reason for you to be paying when you are not living there.", "So your dad is depending on your meager income to keep his household afloat knowing you\u2019ll be in school full time and will accrue expenses while on campus? To expect you to keep paying rent where you don\u2019t live is completely crazy and selfish. I think you need to consider permanently moving out of your parents house.", "NTA. Your parents are financially abusing you. What they are asking is completely unreasonable and selfish. You should get your own phone plan and collect anything important from their house. If they persist with demanding this I would go LC or NC until they accept you are serious and not going to let yourself be taken advantage of.", "NTA for sure, and what the hell? This sounds so bizarre, why would they expect you to pay them when you don\u2019t live there? That\u2019s crazy. I hope they don\u2019t have access to any of your financial stuff.", "NTA! Sheesh.", "NTA\n\nAs long as your stuff is not being kept in the room at their home, I would consider this a month-to-month rental situation. I would tell them the following. \n\n\"Mom/Dad, my last day renting from you will be DATE. I will be leaving the room at TIME ON DATE to move to my new place. Consider this my \\[30 Days\\] notice for my Month to Month lease with you. I have not signed a lease with your formally, so I will not be paying any rent after date. Thank you for your support.\"", "Are they strapped for cash? This seems very odd.", "NTA. The only thing you should be paying them for, when you're out on your own, is the phone bill. If money is tight, I'd drop the streaming services as you use it rarely anyway. See how your expenses would be when moving into dorms, so maybe you could afford declining their \"help\" with books and school supplies.", "NTA.", "Yeah no. You should pay for your cell phone line, but you are not getting any other services from them, you should not be paying them. Frankly, I disagree with charging your kid rent at all as long as they're productive, the only exception being when the parents decide to put that money away for the kids future. Doesn't exactly sound like that's the case here though, so no. Your dad is the AH", "NTA.\n\nDon't pay rent for somewhere you aren't living. That makes zero sense.", "Nta. Think your dad needs to give his head a wobble", "NTA - you move out - so does your rent money", "Start looking at independent housing, possibly section 8.", "Definitely NTA.  That\u2019s so wrong.  You will not be living under their roof anymore, so obviously shouldn\u2019t pay rent.   I will never understand how parents can do this to their own children.  If you can\u2019t afford to help them while in school, don\u2019t have children in the first place.", "Probably NTA, but I have a question.  Are they going to be storing any of your property while you\u2019re away?  Bedroom set, etc?", "NTA but you should give you tell your parents ahead of time before you stop paying it so that they can plan what to do in the future. If they refuse to listen and threaten to disown or something like that, then you might need to cut off all contact from them. With the rising cost of rent and student loan interest caused by inflation, you won't be able to pay off all your bills and theirs unless you're super rich. It's a very hard pill to swallow, but they need to stop being so dependent on you.", "The further away from them, the better. \nBring everything you value out of their reach.", "NTA ---- Ask your father does he still pay rent to his parents", "No you wouldn\u2019t be the ah, but maybe offer a compromise such as contributing $50-$100.

Compulsions suck and feel bad. They\u2019re loud, demanding, and irrational. And we definitely didn\u2019t ask for them! But being corrected when it hasn\u2019t been solicited also feels bad. There is a difference between making corrections when you\u2019re a teacher or a proofreader or an editor (which does seem like a great job opp for you!) because, in those cases, education and correction are implicit. In these comments, however, no one is requesting feedback. There are many reasons for grammar or spelling errors and having them pointed out without asking can be hurtful or irritating.\n\nCompulsions are difficult to control (that\u2019s kind of the crux of OCD after all), but it is our responsibility to mitigate them if they\u2019re affecting others. Now that you\u2019re aware that many people find it rude and unwelcome, maybe you can investigate workarounds for this particular compulsion. Could you write the comment but not send it? Maybe you could write it in a separate note on your computer or phone. Or maybe you could find a sub or forum where people do request feedback that you could direct the compulsion toward instead.\n\nThese are just my gentle, good faith suggestions from one person with OCD to another. Compulsions are a pain to deal with, but we owe it to ourselves and those around us to find ways to manage them.
