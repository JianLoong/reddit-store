I didn\u2019t want my wedding dress to get damaged or lost in the process. Which, considering we did lose a few things during the renovation, I was right to be concerned. My friend offered to keep it in her closet until the renovations were done.\n\nAfter we finished the renovations, I asked my friend for the dress back. She kept saying she\u2019d get back to me. I kept asking and she\u2019d make up excuses. I found it weird.\n\nNow, my sister is getting married and she wanted to wear the dress. This was our mother\u2019s dress and we always agreed we\u2019d each wear it. I told my friend I need it back. She claimed she couldn\u2019t find it. I was perplexed because how does it just get up and walk away? She apologized and offered to pay me the cost of the dress, which I turned down because it wasn\u2019t about money. The dress was sentimental and I felt terrible my sister couldn\u2019t wear it.\n\nMy friend and her husband went away. I was there to water their plants and feed their dogs. I decided to go look myself. The closet was very cluttered. I eventually found the dress. I can totally believe that she missed where it was and she wasn\u2019t being malicious in the slightest. The box was tucked behind a few larger ones containing seasonal clothes. \n\nI texted her saying \u201cI found the dress\u201d. Instead of being happy for me, she asked why I rummaged through her closet? I said I just wanted to double check. She told me I had no right to go through her things. I said that because of her clutter, my sister almost didn\u2019t get to wear a dress she always dreamed of. My friend told me that I could\u2019ve asked her to look again but I pointed out it took 2 years for her to even look in the first place.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698096476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17evnzy/aita_for_going_through_my_friends_closet_to_find/", "score": 3364, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wanted to keep the dress for herself.", "I have to applaud you. Think she was hiding the dress away and knew exactly where it was at. Have to go with whomever said better to not have told her at all. Once missing she would have figured out somebody took it. Hard to question you. My mama once hired a locksmith to open somebody\u2019s trunk that they claimed they couldn\u2019t open to give back some tool because of no key. You did what you had to do. Now go water your own plants if you have any and consider if you want her in your life.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't have told her I found it.  She was not looking good enough and it was important to your family.", "NTA\n\nIt was your property, and at that point, you had permission to be in the home. She made no reasonable attempts to look for the dress, knowing full well that you wanted it back - when she made the first thing not in reference to \"Wow! You found it! Great!\", but instead \"Why did you snoop through my closet?\" she likely already knew where it was. \n\nWhen people take THAT long to look and find something they know they should have, then to me it's malicious.", "NTA.  Sounds like she wanted to keep your mother's dress", "NTA. She never intended to \"find\" your dress. It was up to you to take proactive action.", "NTA. You had been asking about the dress for months and they couldn't be bothered to find it for you, even though they knew it was important to you. It's also not like you tore apart their house: you took a peek in an area where you thought it might be and you found it. I understand some people are protective of their clothes and other personal belongings, but if you're good friends (good enough to let them hold onto the dress) it shouldn't be that much of a problem.\n\nThey have the right to be upset but you have far more of a right to be angry with them. You did the equivalent of cutting them off in traffic, imo. They did the equivalent of... well, holding onto something that was very valuable to you + your family and refusing to give it back to you.", "NTA.

Now you know to avoid storing anything in her clutter. She probably can't find her own stuff, much less yours. \n\n(edit - she likely has some feelings about her own clutter, and wouldn't have let you go through it even with her if you'd asked. Given the value of what you were looking for, I still say you did no wrong.)", "NTA. She obviously never lost it, selling it seemed unlikely. It was gonna be in that house one way or another.", "NTA.  She should have found and returned the dress years ago.", "NTA", "NTA!!! what a weirdo. Was the dress ok? Did she damaged it or dirty it?", "NTA, this is super creepy", "NTA. Most positive scenario.. is your friend a hoarder? Negative scenario.. you have a frenemy who resents you.", "NTA... I dont think she wanted to return it. \n\nI dont like people going through my stuff but this was special circumstances", "Nta! Glad you found it", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA because it was your dress and you needed it urgently for your sister so I think you had every right to get it back. Yeah you should have asked first to go into her closet but it had been 2 years of her keeping and losing this dress so I can see why you lost patience.", "How did she know where you looked for the dress when you only told her you found it?\n\nNTA but I'd question the friendship to a person that would either not bother to look for the dress or keeping it from you on purpouse bc she sure as hell knew exactly where it was and unless her closet leads to narnia it could not habe been that much trouble to get the dress - you found it without even having a clue in what exact place to look for", "NTA - Your friend is incredibly rude. I would never trust her with a personal item again.", "NTA\u2026keep digging. What else is she hiding? Pictures of her and her husband in the dress?", "I works have taken it and not mentioned it but since you did I think her snippy reaction was out of guilt. \nEither she planned on keeping it or never bothered looking for it. \nMaybe she isn\u2019t the friend you thought she was. \nOn the bright side you have the dress and you won\u2019t get asked to water the plants next time she takes a trip. Win win", "NTA- your friend is being super shady. If glad you got your dress back!", "NTA She got defensive because she knew she was in the wrong. Maybe she never actually bothered looking, or maybe she planned to keep it.

Maybe she's disappointed in herself for missing it, but that doesn't give her the right to put it on you", "I don\u2019t know why you even told her you found it.", "Nta. Shes a lying thieving b. I would not trust someone who was like that.", "She not even smart enough to lie convincingly.\nWhen you said \u201cI found the dress.\u201d\nShe could have said \u201cthank goodness.

I don't think she wanted to steal your dress.  I think she was either too lazy to search/ it was inconvenient for her because it was buried in a closet somewhere , or thought she threw it out lol.  You should have taken it and not told her, but you are clearly honest and well- meaning because you trust her and you told her what you did.", "Ok so NTA but\u2026you do realize she fully knew where the dress was and just had zero intention of telling you where it was?\nI wouldn\u2019t have told her you found it tbh and when she went to sell it (cause lets be honest\u2026thats what she was gunna do) she\u2019d have freaked.", "OP you are naive", "I have had my sister's wedding dress for about 10 years. My closet is a mess.  I still know exactly where the dress is. \nNTA. Your friend did not lose the dress. She tried to keep the dress. Glad you managed to get it back.", "You know, I probably would\u2019ve done the exact same thing by looking through the closet.\n\nEspecially if I opened the door and saw that it was a giant cluttered mess. Just to be sure. \n\nBut if I found my dress there, I don\u2019t think I would rub it in the friends face. I believe that\u2019s not really what you did by intention, but if the thing is so cluttered she\u2019s never gonna notice you found it and it\u2019s gone. ( unless she\u2019s coming to your sister\u2019s wedding )but she probably doesn\u2019t even remember what the dress looks like anyway. \n\nBy letting her know that you found it I think her anger comes from seeing it as you invaded her privacy, pawed through her stuff and didn\u2019t believe her when she told you it wasn\u2019t there or that she couldn\u2019t find it. \n\nEven if she truly never looked at all I think she may have taken it that way, considering her reaction.\n\nNTAH OP", "NTA \n\nIf I thought for one second I'd lost my friend's wedding dress I'd have torn my entire closet apart looking for it.  \n\nThe fact she tried to blow you off for two years is sus already.

She clearly had plans for that dress. Good for you for getting it back.", "NTA\n\n\nYou can believe she wasnt being malicious and she honestly lost it\u2026.why not try looking for it again? Or do SOMETHING at least to legit show she is taking steps into trying ti find it. Make her re trace her steps, maybe someone in her family stayed and they put their stuff in the room where your dress was at, someone wore it and took it to the cleaners, the possibilities are endless\u2026. An answer like \u201cwell its not there, end of story\u201d was not enough and you made it clear. \n\n\n\nDid she even \u201ctry\u201d the first time? Y\u2019all knew that it was there at her house (that is why she offered to pay you no?) and if she was really feeling guilty, she would have looked again and again and again until she found it.

She was never giving that dress back, and I think you know that deep down. She either decided to keep it for whatever reason, or thought she had somehow lost it. Either way, she lied to you for **years** and finally just offered you money to clear the issue. 2 years was plenty of time to find something you found in a matter of minutes.

Yeah, I know, you would be mad until the end of time. Saying something and everyone is mad.  \n\n\nShe would have found out when your sister wore the dress for her wedding. That would have been epic. WTF would she do then, accuse you of stealing your own property.   \n\n\nI have a current situation that will take about 4-5 years to play out, and play out it will.

I wouldn\u2019t have even told her I took it after 2 years of asking for it back.", "NTA but honestly why tell her? She didn\u2019t care enough to actually look for it and thought she could just pay you off.

Her for losing the dress and not looking for it. You for rooting through her personal things.", "ESH - your friend should've searched harder to return such an important item to you, but that doesn't give you license to rummage through her possessions without permission.\n\nHowever, don't listen to the other comments suggesting that you 'end your friendship' over this. Nobody has acted maliciously. Instead, wait until your friend returns, and discuss this over coffee. Explain that you're sorry for violating her privacy, and only did it because of how important the dress was to you and how you were under pressure to find it for your sister. If you do this earnestly, she will accept your apology.", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't go through someone's things without asking. She was being difficult at every turn and didn't make you feel like you had many other options, but it's still a violation of her privacy. If you're taking care of her dogs, you'll be at the house more than once, so it would be easy enough to text her and ask if you could have a look.\n\nShe should have been more helpful, more careful with your belongings, and didn't have to react the way she did when you found the dress. \n\nIdt I'd want to be friends with either of y'all after hearing this story so... everyone sucks.", "ESH. She should have given you her dress. You shouldn't go through her closet without her permission. \n\nYou could have messaged her asking if it was OK to take a quick look around for the missing dress. If she said no, you could have asked when a good time would be to help her look for it. If she said never, then you cut your losses. \n\nThen again, now you can cut your losses, and one of them isn't the dress.", "YTA.  You had no right to go through their private things.  The fact that you found your dress doesnt excuse your impropriety.  If you had not found the dress would you still think what you did was appropriate?  And even if you believe her actions justified the intrusion, why did you think you had the right to violate the husband's privacy who had nothing to do with it?  Too many people are focused on the ends justifying the means.  You acted inappropriately.  You should have asked for permission to look before you did so.", "Esh, friend is shady but why didn\u2019t you have it preserved and just give it to your sister when you were done with it?", "Look, I get the dress is of extreme value for you. But there are other ways you could have handled this. Ask her if you can help her search her closet for it. Or and this is my favorite, take her up on the offer to replace it by telling her how much it would cost to have it replicated by a seamstress. I promise you, she would have found that dress. \n\nPart of me is wondering if she actually hid the dress, so she would not have had to return it to you. Or did she actually lose it. I am withholding judgement on this one.", "YTA. You don't go rummaging through people's closets without permission.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I didn\u2019t want my wedding dress to get damaged or lost in the process. Which, considering we did make a few things during the renovation, I was right to be concerned. My friend offered to keep it in her closet until the renovations were done.\n\nAfter we finished the renovations, I asked my friend for the dress back. She kept saying she\u2019d get back to me. I kept asking and she\u2019d make up excuses. I found it weird.\n\nNow, my sister is getting married and she wanted to wear the dress. This was our mother\u2019s dress and we always agreed we\u2019d each wear it. I told my friend I need it back. She claimed she couldn\u2019t find it. I was perplexed because how does it just get up and walk away? She apologized and offered to pay me the cost of the dress, which I turned down because it wasn\u2019t about money. The dress was sentimental and I felt terrible my sister couldn\u2019t wear it.\n\nMy friend and her husband went away. I was there to water their plants and feed their dogs. I decided to go look myself. The closet was very cluttered. I eventually found the dress. I can totally believe that she missed where it was and she wasn\u2019t being malicious in the slightest. The box was tucked behind a few larger ones containing seasonal clothes. \n\nI texted her saying \u201cI found the dress\u201d. Instead of being happy for me, she asked why I rummaged through her closet? I said I just wanted to double check. She told me I had no right to go through her things. I said that because of her clutter, my sister almost didn\u2019t get to wear a dress she always dreamed of. My friend told me that I could\u2019ve asked her to look again but I pointed out it took 2 years for her to even look in the first place.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
