Everything is being held on site. The ceremony, the dinner and the reception are all taking place in the one hotel.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I decided early on that we wanted the reception to be child free. Children are welcome at the ceremony and the early dinner we're having but not for the party afterwards. I, myself, have a 10 year old son who will be there for the ceremony and meal but not the reception. \n\nThe issue is with my fianc\u00e9's sister, Lisa (38F). She has a daughter, Chloe (11F) and has started insisting that Chloe be at the reception. Lisa is the only girl in a family of five children and due to this, she has rarely been told no, even into adulthood.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have been firm on the stance that no children would be allowed in the reception and she is fully aware of the onsite childcare (we have booked a separate room in the hotel especially for this purpose) however she is adamant that Chloe stay with her.\n\nIf it was just me and my fianc\u00e9, it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a big deal. We can handle her. However, she has begun hounding my future mother-in-law whom I get on with really well and has even begun messaging *my* mother on facebook to try and get them to convince the two of us to let Chloe be at the reception.\n\nThis is not okay with me or with my fianc\u00e9. Neither one of our mothers are in the best of health and they don\u2019t need the stress.\n\nShe either doesn\u2019t realise or doesn\u2019t care that if we allow her daughter to attend the reception, we have to allow *all* the children to attend and we wanted to allow the parents to have a fun time in the evening. Even my son isn\u2019t going to be at the reception.\n\nWe don\u2019t see them often however last Sunday, we were all at my future in laws for lunch and so the kids could see each other and she decided to bring it up. She decided it would be a good idea to try and corner me in the kitchen, to try and change my mind. Once again, I reiterated that there would be no children at the reception and well, this didn\u2019t go down well.\n\nI swear, she was close to throwing a grown-up tantrum. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before.\n\nI just told her that the little ones in the other room were better behaved than she was and to grow the hell up and walked around her back to the others. Her tantrum didn\u2019t stop. \n\nAfter this scene, my future mother-in-law asked if we would be willing to bend the rules we have for the reception for Lisa but the two of us were still firm on the \u201cno\u201d.\n\nUsually, I would just stick it out and not care and if she hadn\u2019t started getting other family members involved but now that she has, its beginning to stress me out. \n\nI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re being unreasonable with our request for no children at the reception, but I don\u2019t know if I can handle this for another three weeks.\n\nAITA for sticking to our child free reception rule?", "created_utc": 1675114292, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pep0l/aita_for_not_changing_our_wedding_rule_for_my/", "score": 454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At this point she probably just enjoys creating drama and ruining what should be an exciting time for you. She wants all of the attention to be on her. Stop giving her what she wants. Stop discussing. Stop debating. \n\nThere is a reason she has not given an \"If she cannot go, then I won't either\" ultimatum.

It's the whole - don't rock the boat story. (People realize if they just don't rock the boat, the tempest-maker will be happy. Then those people focused on not rocking the boat start to expect everyone else to also not rock the boat so that the tempest maker will continue to stay calm.) You and fiance may try some 'shame on you for stressing Mom out because you can't accept the rules' type of statements (or not if you don't see that being constructive). Or you can tell MIL, please don't stress over Lisa's demands. We are not changing our minds. Lisa needs to learn to accept that she doesn't always make the rules; this might help her start to learn that.\n4. Lastly, you may want to have someone whose job it is to make sure that no one attends the reception who should not attend the reception. Or decide that if Lisa just brings Chloe in, you will not let her distract you/ hubby from enjoying your reception. Maybe have the DJ announce a reminder that the reception is child free and that children can be watched in the KID room. Then ignore her. People will know that she was the arse who ignored the rule. But it doesn't have to become a distraction to you or the focus of attention.", "I would uninvite Lisa, but I'd also be prepared to just ignore the chaos that kicked off.", "Tantrums work. Tell her she has obviously doesn\u2019t plan to attend  the party.  Did she give any reason why her child must attend?", "NTA, what a freaking brat! She needs to be told in no uncertain terms that she can either go with the plan or not be invited at all! How fucking absurd!!", "Since she has made this public, maybe a group email saying that despite the added stresses and pressures you are being bullied with you will not be changing the arrangements for the one child.", "Child free means child free. Your own kid isn't even going. Not sure what Lisa's problem is.\n\nYou don't have much longer to go, so just block her and tell everyone else to as well so you and your family can proceed to enjoy this special time the way you deserve to\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA.  Since it appears that SIL is being rather childish about the child free wedding rule, just rescind her invitation.  You don\u2019t need that kind of drama on your wedding day.", "NTA. If the child of the bride isn\u2019t allowed, the child of a SIL ain\u2019t shit.", "NTA. You're even providing childcare, that's above and beyond. \n\nIf she can't be apart from her daughter for a few hours she can hangout in the hotel room with the kids, or take the daughter out for their own girls night.", "NTA its time to giver her new choice if she wants to be a guest", "NTA. \"Lisa, you are acting like a child, so you are free to spend the reception in the child care room with Chloe.\"", "Since it's in a hotel, reserve an extra room for your son and the niece. Let them crash there for the night with pizza, snacks, the works. If they have an emergency, everyone will be close by.\n\nNTA for wanting a child free wedding, SIL is TA, OP soft YTA for handling.", "I would add that anyone else who feels the need to pressure you into allowing Chloe to attend is also free to spend the full day with Lisa and Chloe instead of attending the wedding. That you\u2019ll miss their presence, but understand the needs of a child come first.\n\nNo if\u2019s, and\u2019s, or but\u2019s. No is a full sentence.\n\nIf it counts, NTA.", "This right here OP! \nStargazer is right! \n\nFurther, your own son isn\u2019t even attending. Ensure MIL knows you aren\u2019t even bending the rule for your own child and that sums it up right there. \n\nContinue those boundaries and when she tries to sneak Chloe into the reception have a back up bridesmaid or groomsmen ensure she is blocked and redirected to the kids\u2019 area. \n\nGood luck Op!", "No need for above and beyond. That's catering to a tantrumer!", "They have rented a room and are providing on site childcare for the children. SIL is insisting that her daughter be her Emotional Support Human for the reception.", "I like the sound of your older sister!", "Tell them she can come to the ceremony and dinner with the rest of the children, but children are not allowed at the reception, so she will have to join the children after dinner.", "I would give anything to witness that. People like your SIL just wear me thin with their Fuckery. If she wants to act like a child treat her as one.", "Children don't want to go to children parties when there's an adult party they could be part of... especially when they're 10-14 and could be part of the wedding that has probably been hyped up in the family for weeks/months...\n\nbut that's fine... Chloe will cry for half a day and then be fine again... it's not a life or death situation", "Don\u2019t change rules. Have security ready to escort her and kid out. So tired of entitled parents.", "INFO: what is her reasoning for wanting her daughter at the reception? Does she have any health concerns or a reason she can\u2019t be left with the other kids?", "NTA your OWN SON is not going to be at the reception!  Why is Lisa's kid so special that she must?  \nIf she can't be parted from her daughter for a few hours, when there is on site child care provided, then she should go hang out in the child care room with her.  Ridiculous.", "NTA, and DO NOT give in to this woman. Die on this hill.", "NTA\n\nIt's not a child free wedding, it's a child-free party(reception) after the wedding. The children are going to the ceremony, the dinner, and then you have even provided child care in the same hotel. Chloe is 11, for crying out loud. What would she do there? Dance? It just seems strange to have an 11 year old partying with adults, no?\n\nIf Chloe is crying because she can't go to the ball, maybe she's too young to go to the ball. I have no idea why her parent is insisting on this. It's very strange. Her parents need to focus their attention on parenting their daughter, rather than having your reception rule altered.\n\nIs there a different strategy you can take? Is there something extra fun about the kids reception that can be communicated? Maybe Chloe can be enticed that the kids room will be more fun anyway.", "You have done NOTHING wrong. The sister is an immature, spoiled, selfish child.", "She will *absolutely* turn up with her child to the reception and chuck a massive tantrum if the kids is asked to leave. You said she was screaming and carrying on in the kitchen. She will *absolutely* do that at your wedding reception and do her best to spoil your wedding night.\n\nIf I were you, I would uninvite her. Your need not to have a grown woman screaming and crying at your wedding reception outweighs your husbands wish to have all his siblings there. She\u2019ll ruin your wedding party, if she can. \n\nNTA.", "Since Lisa's being a child, she can hang out with Chloe and the other kids.", "NTA, your future SIL is the AH however. Her behavior is inexcusable. You are allowing her to be there at the ceremony and the meal. You are asking for one portion of your evening to be child free and are even providing childcare during that time frame. There is no need for your future niece to be there at the reception.
