Everything is being held on site. The ceremony, the dinner and the reception are all taking place in the one hotel.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I decided early on that we wanted the reception to be child free. Children are welcome at the ceremony and the early dinner we're having but not for the party afterwards. I, myself, have a 10 year old son who will be there for the ceremony and meal but not the reception. \n\nThe issue is with my fianc\u00e9's sister, Lisa (38F). She has a daughter, Chloe (11F) and has started insisting that Chloe be at the reception. Lisa is the only girl in a family of five children and due to this, she has rarely been told no, even into adulthood.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have been firm on the stance that no children would be allowed in the reception and she is fully aware of the onsite childcare (we have booked a separate room in the hotel especially for this purpose) however she is adamant that Chloe stay with her.\n\nIf it was just me and my fianc\u00e9, it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a big deal. We can handle her. However, she has begun hounding my future mother-in-law whom I get on with really well and has even begun messaging *my* mother on facebook to try and get them to convince the two of us to let Chloe be at the reception.\n\nThis is not okay with me or with my fianc\u00e9. Neither one of our mothers are in the best of health and they don\u2019t need the stress.\n\nShe either doesn\u2019t realise or doesn\u2019t care that if we allow her daughter to attend the reception, we have to allow *all* the children to attend and we wanted to allow the parents to have a fun time in the evening. Even my son isn\u2019t going to be at the reception.\n\nWe don\u2019t see them often however last Sunday, we were all at my future in laws for lunch and so the kids could see each other and she decided to bring it up. She decided it would be a good idea to try and corner me in the kitchen, to try and change my mind. Once again, I reiterated that there would be no children at the reception and well, this didn\u2019t go down well.\n\nI swear, she was close to throwing a grown-up tantrum. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before.\n\nI just told her that the little ones in the other room were better behaved than she was and to grow the hell up and walked around her back to the others. Her tantrum didn\u2019t stop. \n\nAfter this scene, my future mother-in-law asked if we would be willing to bend the rules we have for the reception for Lisa but the two of us were still firm on the \u201cno\u201d.\n\nUsually, I would just stick it out and not care and if she hadn\u2019t started getting other family members involved but now that she has, its beginning to stress me out. \n\nI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re being unreasonable with our request for no children at the reception, but I don\u2019t know if I can handle this for another three weeks.\n\nAITA for sticking to our child free reception rule?", "created_utc": 1675114292, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pep0l/aita_for_not_changing_our_wedding_rule_for_my/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At this point she probably just enjoys creating drama and ruining what should be an exciting time for you. She wants all of the attention to be on her. Stop giving her what she wants. Stop discussing. Stop debating. \n\nThere is a reason she has not given an \"If she cannot go, then I won't either\" ultimatum. It is because she doesn't care about the outcome of this argument - she just wants to continue having the argument.

Intermittent reinforcement (where an action leads to success, but only occasionally) is the strongest form of psychological reinforcement.

This can lead to an 'extinction burst' - a last ditch, all-out wave of crappy behaviour to get the reward.", "Honestly, I've been leaning towards this.
