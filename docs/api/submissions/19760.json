I was raised by my mother and stepfather. My dad was not an absent father (M 48), but a inconsistent one. I would lie awake crying and wondering why he didn't like me enough to want to be there for me. One time even when I was 11 I invited him to see me play basketball and I was so proud of myself and really wanted him there. He told me due to him staying up all night playing Xbox he wouldn't be able to. Now to the situation. I want my stepfather to walk me down the aisle and give me away. He's taught me how to be a good person, how a man should treat me, and just has been there for everything. Especially when I was in band and would wake up at 3am to drop me off for competitions. My aunt has been trying to have me do something with the both of them and I do not want to. My mother died nearly 2 years ago now and I know she would want me to do the same as she did for her wedding, have them both walk me down the aisle, but I don't want that. You can't sit on the sidelines and expect to be rewarded when you did nothing. I have been working up the nerve to tell him that my stepfather is walking me, but I was scared. I've tried talking to him about serious issues before and he just either laughed or just yelled. I can't take that right now and didn't want to cause a scene in public or in my home and the police come. So I texted him and said that my step-dad is walking me down the aisle and that I wanted to make him aware before he comes to my wedding. I also said I want him to be there and see me get married since he didn't see my sister get married (she's older and their relationship is awful). He responded with that he's going to fall back and told me congratulations. I also asked for his email to send his invitation due to use using electronic invitations. I immediately started crying since he basically told me he's not coming. I'm heartbroken and upset because I've been trying for years for him to just be there for me and this time when I asked to just show up he refuses. I have blocked him and my stepmother, in case she tries to talk to me, and I don't plan on speaking with either of them anymore. My aunt (his sister) is upset for how I dealt with the situation and I'm scared none of my dad's family will come to my wedding. I've been crying all morning and now as I type this. So am I the jerk?", "created_utc": 1686845333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14a6cbh/aita_for_how_i_told_my_dad_some_news/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can make any procedural decision you like for any reason you like and you are not required to justify, defend, or explain it to anyone. Sure, I wouldn't advise someone to go out of their way to alienate people with hostile or bizarre wedding procedures, but when it comes to who you want to walk to down the aisle, that is extremely personal based on your connection to that person and does not require \\*any\\* justification.\n\nNext, in this particular case, there is very understandable reasoning behind your decision. And I suspect everyone who knows your father at all understands \\*exactly\\* why you feel the way you do. What often happens is people lean on the person who is more reasonable to \"be reasonable!\" as a method of \"resolving\" a conflict or \"keeping the peace\" (which is not true peace). So that's probably what's happening with those who are \"upset\" with you for how you handled the situation. You handled it fine.\n\nThis is something I have to remind myself of frequently: people like your father and his enablers will take as much energy as we give them. Put him out of the picture to the extent possible (which will get easier as time goes on) and focus on the positive things in your life like your stepfather and your new life with your partner.", "Listen, it's not you. It never was you. He has no idea how to be a father like your step dad. Be thankful you have him and forget yiur dad. He sucks", "Nta.\n\nAnd it only gets worse. I know from experience as my mom is the same way. You think your wedding is bad, but it gets worse when it's your child's first birthday, or a promise to come visit to see that child, or them laughing about how they thought they had gotten presents for everyone & that someone not related to you points out that they missed your child. Or they call you & your child says hi to them on the phone a dozen times & they don't respond & you have to explain to a 4-year-old why they didn't respond back.\n\n\nHe is doing you a favor by not coming. It sucks but you'll feel a sense of freedom, not having to worry about them.", "NTA..  It's your wedding..\n\nMy dad wasn't in my life a lot & I wondered like you did..  I've seen him a handful of time since 18...  Last last thing he said to me was \"If you want a relationship with me, then your going to have to put in the work.\"  I left, then thought about it.. and thought hell no- I realized that he just didn't care so I walked away and haven't contacted him again.  It's been over 25 years & I've never looked back.\n\nThe best thing he ever did for me was to show his true colors...  My step father walked me down the aisle.  He was my father so he got the PRIVILAGE of doing that", "NTA.. your dad is a massive AH and does deserve you - definetly does not deserve the honour of walking you down the aisle", "NTA. What you have there is a sperm donor. A father takes care of you and that sounds like who will be walking you down the aisle. Congrats on the upcoming nuptials!", "NTA.  \n\n>I've been trying for years for him to just be there for me \n\nIf he wants a relationship with you, it's HIS job to try.  He's the adult in the relationship, and he's put himself in the position of being sidelined at your wedding because he's failed over and over again to be there for you.  \n\nAs for his family not coming to your wedding, I have a couple uncles who have similar relationships with children that they refused to be there for.  Whatever my uncles say about their kids hurting them or their kids not making an effort, we're not blind.  We know that they're just upset to find out there are consequences to being a shitty father.  I promise you his family knows who he is and knows what kind of father he's been to you.  Hopefully they still show up for you anyway as they should, but ultimately I would just focus on the people who ARE there because those are the ones who love and support you.", "Yeah YTA. You should respect your late mother's wishes. It sounds like (and this may not be the case) your decision was made because your real father failed terribly while your stepfather stepped up to the plate.\n\nMight be too late but I'd still push for both to walk you down the aisle.\n\nI'm betting your father is devastated and ashamed of himself but won't show it to you. He may have made mistakes in his life, but I wouldn't deny one of the biggest days of his (and yours) lives. By shoveling him off in favor your step-dad, it feels like you are trying to make him feel as what he made you feel when growing up. By barring him from a very important chapter in his and his daughter's lives, you are getting your revenge.\n\nRevenge is often bitter. I hope you can find a way to reconcile with your true father because he will likely take your decision to his grave.\n\nEdit: I'm often the most downvoted post in these threads because I like to consider viewpoints from the people involved, not just OP.

I decided to match the same energy he gives me. My mother knew how he acted and gets upset when things don't go his way. His maturity level is the same as a 12 year old.

I suggested simply as to continue respecting your family heritage, by honoring your moms wishes while still including your dad.\n\nIf you feel this strongly about his involvement in your wedding, then fine. You have every right to be.\n\nI'm just saying that your bio father will likely remember this decision and it will haunt him for the test of his life, not being able to be there for your sisters big day and then being excluded from yours.

Of course it's easier to kick someone when they're already down. \n\nBy refusing to let the man walk his daughter down the aisle, it feels like OP is reciprocating the abuse right back at the perpetrator. \n\nEven though she stated as not for revenge, she wants to make her father feel like she did when she was younger. She admits she was treated like shit, so she wants to treat him like shit. That doesn't sit well with me hence my post.", "Or, and hear me out this is pretty crazy, she's just rewarding the man who treated her well :0\n\nMy dad's a dick, so he's not invited to events, it's not revenge, it's just why would I invite someone who's never cared for me? \n\nNo, op is not abusing him ir reciprocating, should she reward the man who treated her like she was less important than gaming all night?\n\n\"Of course it's easier to kick someone while they are already down\" like him refusing to attend his daughters wedding putting her in tears? Explain to me how she's wrong for not having him walk her down the aisle and not forgiving him but he's not for completely blowing off his daughters wedding?", "I already stated as such. Revenge is often bitter. It really proves that OP is her father's daughter because when given the chance, she acts the exact same way as her father did. We've already come to the conclusion that father's behavior was poor, but I disagree strongly that OP copy that behavior in her life.", "\"Acts the same way her father did\" oh, why? Did she tell him she wasn't gonna be apart of his wedding? Did she blow off his event because she wanted to game all night?\n\nDid she laugh or yell at him whenever he tried to have a serious discussion? She isn't acting like him.\n\nAnd so, basically, you're saying, \"reward the guy with poor behaviour because someone else wants you to and if you don't you're just like your crap dad!!\"??", "I'm a strong proponent for treating others how you would like to be treated. OP should exemplify the values that her step dad taught her, not extrapolate the values that her bio dad had.", "If someone shoplifts you'd still arrest them, that motto works when it's innocent people, ops dad isn't innocent"]}
