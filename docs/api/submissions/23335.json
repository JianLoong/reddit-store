Kevin was trying (unsuccessful) to hit on Alex untill she got annoyed and said \"you do realise i'm gay and most likely slept with more girls you've ever seen\"\n\nKevin got visibly red and keep saying things like \"you are just saying that because you never had a good d*ck\" or \"once you try real men you will change mind\".\n\nWell after few beers i just found it borring and as i could see Alex getting annoyed. I started saying \"Don't get angry at him, he might be right, but what he is actually trying to say is that he might be gay but he needs a \"real men\"\". Then i spended few minutes explaining that what he meant was in fact about him and that HE \"needs a good d*ck\" (have to addmit i went bit far but was too many beers in and too annoyed to care about that and what i was saying kept ppl laughing).\n\nAfter a while Kevin just kept saying that he is \"NOT gay\", well we just dropped topic. However my drunk self kept adding \"just remember, he is NOOOT gay\" whenever Kevin was saying sth.\n\nOnce we all went home i got tex from Sarah stating i am an A-hole because i humiliated her lil bro and he don't wanna see us anymore, until i apologies. However i don't even know what i should apologise for, Alex is gay and Matt is bi, soo i don't see calling someone gay as a sth offensive, same as i wouldn't see calling someone straight be.\n\nWould like outsiders perspective, especially now that i'm sober, i feel like i should actually apologise to Alex maybe?, but she seems to be the one laughing the most.

Conservatives usually are in that camp, but this is a bit louder and more confident than usual.", "ESH because you used gay as an insult, that's not cool. Do I understand why you niggled at him and think Sarah and Kevin are also ah? Yes. It's not okay just because Alex and Matt didn't say anything or wouldn't find it insulting.", "I would say NTA, bigots deserve to be called out. However I'd suggest talking to Alex and ask her what she thought about it and if she thinks you were out of line. If you talk again with Sarah about it (which I think you should), I would tell her something along the lines off: Maybe I should have handled the situation a bit better by actually adressing the problem with what Kevin said, but I am not apologizing for trying to defend my friend and making her more comftable in this situation. Kevin was out of line with what he said and I am disappointed that you didnt say anything to him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Funny this macho guy went crying to his sister", "Never apologize for putting a homophobe in his place.", "ESH", "I would say NTA.  Sounds like Kevin needed someone to put his behavior in check.  In my opinion you basically gave him a taste of his own medicine.  If it were me, I would tell Sarah you'll apologize to Kevin after he apologizes to Alex for being an annoying little prick.", "ESH\n\nTurning it around was fair game but you took it too far and at a certain point it just wasn't about you. Obv you were somewhat using gay as an insult even if you don't think you were, that's kind of what you were doing.", "ESH. Casually implying that people need to be sexually assaulted\u2026 to understand something or something they lack\u2026 is just wrong no matter how drunk and frustrated you are.. On many many reasons. But mostly because many lesbians get SA'd precisely for reasons Kevin has mentioned.", "NTA\n\nIf Sarah has never checked her brother's behavior she's part of the problem. My little brother occasionally makes really bad \"jokes\" and I don't entertain that shit. \n\nEven if it's family, you should call someone out for being hateful, and the whole \"oh you wouldn't be a lesbian if you found the right man or got dicked down\" is so fucking annoying. \n\nNot only is it just straight up incorrect, it's fucking gross and hateful.", "ESH-Kevin was way out of line with what he was saying. But it sounds like the topic was done with and over and you just kept bringing it up which also makes you an AH.", "NTA. You gave him a taste of his own medicine and he didn\u2019t like it. Maybe he\u2019ll remember that next time he goes to do it to someone else.", "Everything he said was terrible, but you shouldn't have kept that going all evening. \"Gay\" is not an insult, but he had the right to feel uncomfortable when his sexuality was **constantly** questioned and people made fun of him. Calling him out was the right thing to do, but making fun of him all evening like this was not. The way he treated Alex was horrible, but the way you paid him back was no better. ESH", "NTA for turning things around on him, but you kind of are for pretending that calling someone something they aren't isn't insulting. You know you were trying to be insulting to put him in his place. Even so, he doesn't really deserve an apology unless he's willing to apologize for his own behavior first.", "ESH. Kevin sounds like a jerk who has no clue what he is talking about. Your reaction went too far and made your friends uncomfortable. Apologize to Alex and Sarah, but not Kevin.", "ESH its a myth that all men who act super macho and are homophobic are secretly gay. Some are yes but not all of them. It also minimizes the issue of bigotry. In that bigotry is a funny problem from the queer community for not accepting who they are, not a serious societal issue that has ended with numerous people violently assaulted or killed.\n\nAnd while implying someone is gay to mess with them seems like a good way to get back at them and tell them to stop it actually isn't because you've turned the concept of being gay into an insult, you're accusing them of being gay because it will make them feel ashamed it might be ironic but you are framing being queer as something bad and thats not ok even as a joke. Being a homosexual should never be framed as something bad.\n\nAnd I know you're going to say \"but I was trying to get him to stop because he was an asshole i was standing up for queer\" no you we're being a juvenile ass. You know how to make a homophobe stop that shit and stand up for queer people? \n\nYou go \"you need to stop that homophobic shit right now or leave. Everyone here supports and respects our queer friends and if you're going to keep talking about how Alex needs a dick or what ever offensive nonsense then you need to leave. This is not up for debate stop or gtfo\"\n\nAll you did was make a night with friends all about entertaining a homophobic prick.", "NTA.\n\nYoung Kevin and every guy who thinks their d\\**k (or any d\\**k) is a \"cure\" for women's sexuality needs to be prepared to have feedback/reviews on effectiveness/performance of that \"cure\". After all, we live in a \"free market\" economy, don't we?", "You gave this idiot a taste of his own medicine. Absolutely NTA.", "Her 24 year old adult brother was homophobic to her friends, Sarah needs to be apologizing to EVERYONE in the group for not putting her brother in his place. NTA", "NTA", "ESH\n\nBecause you kinda did exactly the same thing as Kevin but in reverse. I get that you did it as a joke when he was being serious but it's not so much of a joke if you keep saying it. Also, he was not saying these things to you but to Alex and she could hold her own against him so there was no need to butt in and be petty about the whole thing.", "NTA - All you did was turn around what he was saying to Alex. Funny that Sarah didn't seem to have a problem when Alex was on the receiving end of Kevin's comments. She should be demanding her brother apologize to your friend.", "Agreed NTA. It\u2019s like hearing a despicable customer is never returning \ud83c\udf89", "This is such a mature response, OP should definitely do this.", "Just to clarify, (misunderstanding might come from translation) noone implied SA, not me nor Kevin, it was more of : you should find someone to get D", "nowhere does op state that alex or matt were uncomfortable, and Sarah can pound sand. *she* should have shut her brothers shit down long before op said anything. she's not a good friend or ally for letting her friend be harassed by her homophobic brother.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with giving misogynistic and homophobic young men a taste of their own medicine by flipping their moronic \u201clogic\u201d against them. There\u2019s also nothing wrong with standing up for your friends, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, in a situation like this. The onus of correcting misogynistic or homophobic behavior shouldn\u2019t only be up to the people on the receiving end of said behavior, it should up to all of us.", "He mentioned Alex needing to sleep with a guy to see what she's missing. That is called corrective r\\*pe and happens more than you think.", "I think this is a case of justified ah so NTA.\n\n\n Kevin was a d *** and an ah for not dropping the subject after being told Alex swings for the other team and he was obnoxious by bringing it up repeatedly. You stopped this by joking at his expense - normally not ok but in this case since he was irritating to everyone else ....\n\nTell his sister that if she should have showed you all some respect by telling Kevin to stfu and tell him to go away when he was bothering the whole group with his obnoxious comments.\n\nAlso tell her that if she brings him again to meet with you guys she won't be invited anymore.\n\nI think it's disgusting what he said about Alex needing good d to change her sexuality.", "I get what you're saying but there is a line between giving someone a taste of their own medical, and bullying. A comment or two is a taste of their own medicine, continuing it all night is just plain wrong. If you have that much of an issue with someone, don't hang out with them. You can just leave.", "Homophobic sexual harassers deserve to be bullied. \n\nBy your logic Kevin should have just left if he didn't like it.", "No one deserves to be bullied. Ever! Two wrongs do not make a right. There's something to be said for taking the moral hig ground and not engaging in the same.\n\nYa he absolutely could have left. Any one of them could. I never said he couldn't. They're all adults. If you don't like someone, you don't have to be around them!"]}
