Sarah however brought her younger brother Kevin(24M)with her as he is currently living with her. \n\nKevin from the moment we ordered first beer tried to act all macho, talking about how many girls he slept with and how much money he will get once he lauches his crypto. Kevin was trying (unsuccessful) to hit on Alex untill she got annoyed and said \"you do realise i'm gay and most likely slept with more girls you've ever seen\"\n\nKevin got visibly red and keep saying things like \"you are just saying that because you never had a good d*ck\" or \"once you try real men you will change mind\".\n\nWell after few beers i just found it borring and as i could see Alex getting annoyed. I started saying \"Don't get angry at him, he might be right, but what he is actually trying to say is that he might be gay but he needs a \"real men\"\". Then i spended few minutes explaining that what he meant was in fact about him and that HE \"needs a good d*ck\" (have to addmit i went bit far but was too many beers in and too annoyed to care about that and what i was saying kept ppl laughing).\n\nAfter a while Kevin just kept saying that he is \"NOT gay\", well we just dropped topic. However my drunk self kept adding \"just remember, he is NOOOT gay\" whenever Kevin was saying sth.\n\nOnce we all went home i got tex from Sarah stating i am an A-hole because i humiliated her lil bro and he don't wanna see us anymore, until i apologies. However i don't even know what i should apologise for, Alex is gay and Matt is bi, soo i don't see calling someone gay as a sth offensive, same as i wouldn't see calling someone straight be.\n\nWould like outsiders perspective, especially now that i'm sober, i feel like i should actually apologise to Alex maybe?, but she seems to be the one laughing the most. Soo i really don't know. AITA?\n\nEdit: small info, how others reacted.\nMatt - was kinda ignoring subject and sreat conversation away from that.\nAlex - joined me in joking saying stuff like \"well gay men have actually very high standards soo he wont find anyone willing to give hime theD\"\nSarah - was laughing at both Kevin and my comments \n\nUpdate : I decided to do an adult thinn and just texted everyone (beside Kevin, dont have a way to contact him)\n\nTexted Sarah that ima willing to apologise to Kevin if he apologise to Alex. She left me on [Read]\n\nTried to say sorry to Matt if my remarks were inappropriate, but he cut me off and said that \"if you are apologising that means you think of gay as sth bad soo don't you dare apologise\". Well i took back my apology\n\nLastly called Alex. Well she called me an idiot for thinking she would be offended since she joined me in joking. However i am to: under no circumstances apologise to Kevin.\nAperentally Sarah also texted Alex, that she needed to apologise to her brother. And when Alex started laughing, Sarah said \"well he just said out loud what we were thinking\".\n\nLong story short: looks like we are going to cut Sarah off.", "created_utc": 1690553053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bye2k/aita_for_calling_my_friend_brother_not_a_gay/", "score": 775, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It also minimizes the issue of bigotry. In that bigotry is a funny problem from the queer community for not accepting who they are, not a serious societal issue that has ended with numerous people violently assaulted or killed.\n\nAnd while implying someone is gay to mess with them seems like a good way to get back at them and tell them to stop it actually isn't because you've turned the concept of being gay into an insult, you're accusing them of being gay because it will make them feel ashamed it might be ironic but you are framing being queer as something bad and thats not ok even as a joke. Being a homosexual should never be framed as something bad.\n\nAnd I know you're going to say \"but I was trying to get him to stop because he was an asshole i was standing up for queer\" no you we're being a juvenile ass.

This where I was torn between ESH and NTA. \n\nWhat puts me over the edge into NTA is that Sarah should\u2019ve stepped in and stopped her brother before it got bad enough you had to stop it.  She knows who her brother is and she would\u2019ve known that an insensitive comment about your friend\u2019s sexuality was possible. The way you describe this it sounds like it took a bit before it got out of hand and you stepped in which left her plenty of opportunities to shut him down before it escalated to that point. Flirting with your sisters friends is already questionable and surprising she didn\u2019t take an issue before it got to this point especially considering her sexuality. Then he got butt hurt when rejected and said some AH shit. \n\nSome additional info may also be helpful. Did Sarah laugh along and do nothing about the comments you kept making?

Kevin was, at the root, telling someone who is only attracted to woman that they just need a good D to like men.
