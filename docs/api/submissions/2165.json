I'm sure part of your reaction is wondering if you had stayed if things would have been different. Please try not to think this way. I'm sure others have suggested it, but try to find a good therapist. Guilt can really mess with the mind, whether the guilt is warranted or not. It also really sucks that you had to find this out the way you did, I am so sorry for your loss.", "Op, I am so sorry for your loss. You raised Finn as your own for years, he thought of you as his mother, and you loved him as a son. The only reason you moved away was to rebuild your life after his dad treated you so badly. Finding out about this from Facebook... Finn's dad should have made an effort to tell you himself. Not that he sounds like the most caring person ever.\n\nYour sister... I barely know what to say. If your situation happened to someone I hate, I would still treat them gently. Losing a child, even one you were estranged from, is a life changing event. Hurt like that goes deep. If I were you, I wouldn't invite sister back into your home until she can make an apology that you feel is genuine.\n\nI want so much to hug you right now. Go ask your husband to do it for me? You have a lot of emotion to work through, and it sounds like he is there for you no matter what. He's right about talking to a therapist.

Talking to someone outside of the situation can be a huge help.\n\nYou need time to grieve, don't let anyone get in the way of that.", "What callous response to you losing YOUR child!

Her grief clearly is tied to leaving Finn behind.", "It depends on what she wants. If, like most redditors, she wants revenge and vindication, then she can go NC until the earth cools with any family member who even speaks of her sister. Or she could do the subtle enemy thing, where she pretends it wasnt that big a deal but bides her time for when she can inflict the biggest harm. I recognize that these would be pretty ordinary responses here and perhaps they are exactly what you would do. \n\nMy suggestion is that sometimes one can take smaller rather than larger offense, and decide that in the long run life is better being on good terms with more relatives and friends rather than fewer. It is a way of thinking about relationships and about responding to offense that is clearly alien to you and to a large proportion of. So many redditors clearly have bad relationships, or no relationships, with people who were once important to them (or could have been important to them). Perhaps the difference is perspective is not coincidental.", "If he took his own life I fully understand the reactions. The what if\u2019s for me would be endless. I am so sorry for your loss.

You left because of circumstances and treatment, but that doesn't negate who he was to you.\n\nAt 20 years old your sister should be adult enough, COGNIZANT enough, to understand that raising a child for that long, they become yours.

You do need to apologize.  Your family saw all of the negative aspects of your relationship and not the positive ones concerning Finn and don't understand your feelings.  That is not their fault, but it isn't yours either.  It wasn't wise of you to rehash the past and now you know why.  The past has nothing good for you and you have your lovely new family now.  You need to bury the past and live in the now.", "YTA, you went looking to get hurt by looking up your ex.  Congratulations you fucked around and found out.

When I was in my tweens, my family and I were part of a support group for cancer and leukemia patients and their families (our dad was one of them). My younger brother, who was 10 at the time, befriended a kid who was a patient and despite his own fear of hospitals from some serious medical issues, went through decontam two or three days a week to sit with the other kid and do some puzzles and read some books. He was terrified by it. It hurt him to do it. But he felt he had to to give this other kid a friend during a time of need.\n\nThey told us my brother's friend was doing fine when we left the area (my dad was only there that summer for treatment). Turns out they lied and just under five years later, I was not-so-idly flipping through an essay that talked about heroism in doomed children and the kid is mentioned by a psuedonym but with so many details that I knew immediately who it was. By the timeline, he died not long after we left the hospital community ... and nobody had bothered to tell my brother. The kid had been dead for just over 4 years.\n\nThe confrontation was epic. I was 17ish, my brother 15ish, and my mother in her very early 40s at the time. Considering that only my late father had had any military service whatsoever, sailors would have been surprised at the level of skilled, artful profanity in the discourse. Mom eventually acknowledged that she was the AH, and promised she'd never do that again. And then, of course, she did in her own cancer diagnosis, keeping it from us for awhile so that we could plan and execute my brother's wedding without distractions, 15 years after the first incident. Let's just say the profanity was even better that time around, and I was legit afraid my brother would never forgive my Mom. It took some effort, in fact.\n\nDo not let anyone tell you the years obviate the grief you are entitled to feel. There's no statute of limitations on this shit. Feel, process, heal.", "NTA. You left the dad you didn\u2019t stop caring about the boy. It\u2019s just rude how she responded and she was quite frankly asking for it so no you weren\u2019t in the wrong at all", "NTA, in a moment where you were overwhelmed with grief your sister showed a profound lack of empathy. \n\nHonestly I think that's reason enough to not have her in your house, because if she doesn't care about you and your feelings, why would you give her a space in your home? But on top of that, she is modeling this behavior for your children. Why would you want someone around your kids who you can't trust to be kind?", "My condolences for your loss. Kids are they joy if this world and its just so sad to see them go.", "NTA. Even though your relationship with your ex wasn\u2019t great, you are actually a human being with emotions. It is absolutely okay that you had such a visceral response to learning of the loss of Finn. I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA \n\nWhat your sister said was horribly cruel and showed a lack of empathy. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss and hope you consider grief therapy.", "NTA your sister has a sociopathic level of empathy. Sketchy", "NTA  and your family have no right to choose who you care about. WTF? How rude.", "I looked up my ex to find out how Finn was doing. Not to find information on my ex and my husband knows this very well.", "You are fine in what you're feeling. \n\nAll I wanted to say is, it was in no way your fault whatever happened and it probably wound not have changed anything if you were still in the relationship. \n\nDo not, EVER feel guilty or responsible in any way. \n\nI am hoping you already know that but I got that vibe from your post. I know you're angry at your sister for not understanding you. And that is absolutely fine. But once the anger goes it comes the guilt and the overthinking. \n\nI want to go ahead and say it was not your fault. You were an amazing role model for him and showed him that you shouldn't let others treat you like crap. He will be looking after you from now on the same way you looked after him from 3 to 10 years old. \n\nLook ahead and lift your chin up with the understanding that you gave that child a better childhood he would've had in other circumstances. And now give your babies an extra hug from him tonight. \n\nIt is okay to cry. It is okay to hurt. It is okay to break down even if others do not understand. \n\nStay strong. I wish you all the best", "The problem here is not her feelings toward the boy, it's her feelings toward you. You are on the floor in the throes of grief and she didn't have any empathy for you.", "Totally understand that! Sadly my nephew died at 26 due to complications from meth. Sadly there\u2019s nothing we can do about their choices. I\u2019m guessing he committed suicide?  I\u2019m a counselor and there been some kids who I worry about. It\u2019s generally the people who don\u2019t tell anyone about their situation who commit. I hope his family and you can find them help you need if you want to talk to someone. 988 is a crisi line but can help out with depression or anxiety"]}
