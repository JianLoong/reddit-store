You have every right to feel the way you do.. please PLEASE look into therapy immeaditly to help you process and get through your grief, loosing a child, even one that isn't your own but one you took care of for years can take a huge toll on someone, so please be extra kind with yourself. Your sister is disgraceful, disgusting.", "NTA - you broke up with the dad , not with the kid \n\n\\- you loved and cared for the kid for so long he was your child \n\n\\- your sister shows no sympathy or empathy at all", "You are NTA. You found out someone you love and helped raise had passed, your reaction is 100% justified. And so is your reaction to kick your sister out for being heartless. Wtf is wrong with her that she has no sympathy at all?

And I hope she have a very distorted description of events to your parents, otherwise their response is disgusting too.\n\nYou are absolutely allowed to feel all of those feelings and to mourn someone you had a hand in raising.

You are allowed to feel grief for a child you were close enough to consider your own.

I have my husband and he actually is a huge advocate for therapy and wants me to make at least one appointment to work through the guilt I\u2019m feeling so yeah. \n\nMy sister\u2019s always been hard headed but this shocked me so much that I began to believe that maybe I did something wrong to evoke such a reaction.", "To be fair, she\u2019s only 3 years older than Finn and was 13 the last time she saw him. She also didn\u2019t see him very often as I had essentially distanced myself from my family. \n\nAnd thank you, my husband has been extremely supportive. It\u2019s just painful to think about the circumstances surrounding his passing and thinking about whether I could\u2019ve prevented it you know? Thank you again.", "You did nothing wrong.  You reacted exactly like any normal human being would have reacted when confronted with the death of someone you\u2019d once loved and cared for.  Your sister\u2019s behavior was abhorrent.
