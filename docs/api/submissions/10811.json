At that point we don't know what time it was. Could have been 11:15am could have been 4pm. She had multiple times to say something to him, ask if he wanted help, ect. Instead he gets ignored.", "We share a very little flat, so for me it's normal to wait with cleaning until everyone's out of bed or ask if it's okay to start. (Even if we don't want help from the other).", "That is still morning.", "Same thing could be said about the boyfriend though? \nWhat if that was his only day off and wanted to relax too but knew that the house,needed to be cleaned?\n\nOp doesn\u2019t give any other info of their chores division so I\u2019m going off based on what OP wrote. From my perspective it sounds like Op didn\u2019t want to help cleaning, which should be a shared workload. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying Op is an asshole.", "Most people are awake on their days off at 11 am. It\u2019s an acceptable time to vacuum", "I worked in a pub chain for five years. Mostly closes, where I\u2019d start between three and six and finish anywhere between 12:30 and three am, we\u2019d have a drink after work, I\u2019d take everyone home (running about half an hour, maybe more depending on who was working that night) and then I liked to chill a bit before bed, especially because I\u2019m a night owl. 11 am vacuuming would\u2019ve pissed me off \n\nSame for the thousands, millions of other people who do shift work and still try to get enough sleep", "Unless someone is working the night shift, there is no reason a fully functioning adult should be sleeping until 11.", "Grown adults are allowed to stay up as late as they want and sleep in as late as they want regardless of whether they work late or not.
