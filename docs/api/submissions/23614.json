{"id": 23614, "submission_id": "15f2yh6", "title": "AITA for always feeding my niece \"fancy\" expensive food?", "selftext": "I (29F) have a niece (5F) who is my SIL's (24F) daughter. In the beginning of this year, her boyfriend left her and she has been a single mom since. She is going through a hard time right now trying to balance raising her daughter while working a minimum wage job. \n\nBecause of this, I offered to babysit my niece on most weekday evenings so her mom can work extra shifts and not worry about paying for a sitter.This arrangement has been going really smoothly for the last two months. My niece is an absolute angel and we have gotten so incredibly close. I've noticed whenever we've been over to my SIL's that her fridge is severely lacking in fresh foods. I totally understand how expensive grocery shopping can be and how much of a privilege it is to buy fresh food each week. Therefore, I don't blame her one bit. When I first started babysitting my niece, my SIL instructed her favorite foods were \"frozen chicken nuggets and fries\" and she insisted that she'd be happy if I fed her that every meal. \n\nPersonally, I'm super big into cooking. I'm also very into nutrition and making sure meals are well-balanced. So I couldn't bear to just feed my niece chicken nuggets and fries at every meal knowing how unhealthy the two are long term. I began to introduce her to more vegetables and meats/seafood to make sure she was getting adequate nutrition. Recently, I've made her pan-seared salmon, steamed chilean sea bass, ma po tofu, peking duck, lemon asparagus, braised bok choy to name a few. And the thing is, she absolutely LOVES every single dish! I also blend her a fresh fruit and vegetable smoothie every evening as a little dessert. My niece has turned into a huge foodie and will try anything I cook. She's even taken an interest in helping cook alongside me.\n\nI didn't see anything wrong with what I was doing until three days ago my SIL called me to confront me. She basically told me to stop feeding her all this \"fancy rich people shit\" and accused me of trying to turn her daughter against her. Apparently, at home, my niece now refuses to eat chicken nuggets and requests to eat a bunch of foods I make. But, a month ago, I ordered a bunch of  fresh groceries to their home because I knew my niece had taken a liking to my food. However, a few days later, I asked my niece if her and her mom had cooked anything and she said \"no\" and that her mom had thrown most of it out. I was appalled, but chose not to confront my SIL. It made me livid to have her bash me for caring for her daughter's well-being and nutrition. I told her as such and called her ungrateful for throwing out my groceries and that she should be thankful her daughter is eating well. That did not end well and I heard her start crying on the other end before just hanging up on me.\n\nI do feel for her (and I told her as such), but our top priority should always be her daughter's well-being, which I feel like she's putting aside by asking me to stop feeding her. Am I not seeing something here? AITA?", "created_utc": 1690866888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15f2yh6/aita_for_always_feeding_my_niece_fancy_expensive/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Uou are right to look after your niece\u2019s health\u2014BUT if your SIL is working extra shifts, what makes you think she has the time to cook, even if you do send groceries? If your SIL doesn\u2019t have the time to cook fresh food, naturally it would need to be trashed, and she doesn\u2019t need you criticizing her for struggling\u2014which is what you did by calling her ungrateful for a gift she definitely did not ask for.\n\nIf you want to consider your niece\u2019s health at home, please consider asking your SIL if you can prepare frozen meals to defrost, or hell, even invite her to dinner weekly to foster not only healthy nutrition, but healthy familial relations.", "NTA. But, you sound like you aren't a parent. The only reason I say that is that you don't seem to recognize that the biggest source of vulnerability and sense of inadequacy is the ability of a parent to care and protect their child. What she heard from both you and her daughter is that she lacks the means and ability to adequately care for her child. Her partner left her. She's broke and overwhelmed. The last thing she wants to think about doing right now is learning to braise bok Choi. I would strongly suggest that if you really do care about your SIL you take the high road here and apologize (even though you are right) and give her a gift card to a grocery store and tell her that you respect her choices in her circumstances.", "NAH. \n\nYou are very kind for everything you're doing. But I feel you're blind to SIL's reality. Sending groceries is NOT helpful to a person who has neither the time or the skills to cook like you do. Your niece has developed a liking for your cooking. I imagine even if her mum did set down a plate of steamed veggies (which would be healthy) down for her, she would still refuse to eat because they are \"not tasty\". You both have to find a solution for this that doesn't place unrealistic burdens and expectations on SIL but is also best for the child.", "NTA at all. I have kids. Every reasonable parent would be happy that their kids is eating healthy. I can understand the moms frustration, kids pick up habits and routine very fast. So now, she can't feed her child at home.\n\nHowever, the mom must educate the child, that there are home rules and aunty rules.\n\nOther than that, you offered to support her with food, maybe show here how to make one Aunty dish that is healthy yet fast and easy, and most importantly, to the liking of the little one. However, it will never be 'that', since it it is not made by Aunty....\n\nMy son is somewhat of a picky eater. My mom got him to eat Omeletts for breakfast. He was excited. He loved it. He asked me to make him that for breakfast. I don't have tome in the morning to make eggs, since I go to work but my mom doesn't. So I had to explain that I can only do it in the weekend. But I naturally prefer a child eating eggs on the weekend than not at all... But he refused them after a couple of times, since it doesn't taste exactly like what his Omy was making.\n\nThe mom is being unreasonable and is letting her pride take precedent over her child. Sad to see someone finding I'll intentions where happiness could be found.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL should be grateful you were helping.  I think she felt threatened which is kind of strange but she must be under great stress to blow it on you.  The fact that she cried tells me she need some serious help herself.", "NTA, because you were helping your niece.\n\nThis sounds like your sister having a tough time with seeing the limits of what she can do for her child. And letting your sister accept recognizing that it takes a village.", "Totally NTA. You\u2019re making your niece nutritious food, and you love cooking. She is incredibly ungrateful for throwing the food out.", "I think ESH slightly. \n\nI know you were trying to do the best by her, but I think you went about it the wrong way. \n\nIn addition to fresh food being expensive, it can also take a bit more time to not only make but to learn how to actually cook it. \n\nIdk how it went down but she may have thrown out the groceries because they went bad and didn't have time to use them. \n\nI think mom/SIL could have tried some basic fresh recipes. But if you are tired popping chicken/fries/pizza in the oven is faster less work vs cooking fresh. \n\nI think you could have slowly tried to help teach your SIL how to cook, kinda like a 3 way bonding experience  Some of the dishes sound like they might be more elaborate/time consuming. I know some are not but if you don't know it might seem like it is.\n\nIf I want to make a new dish it might take me 30/40 to find a recipe learn how to make it then prep is almost always double the time they give. Once I know it, it can be quick. Throwing something together with fresh stuff can be quick but it comes with practice. \n\nAlso SIL might not be able to afford to consistently buy fresh food.", "NTA, she\u2019s jealous she doesn\u2019t have the time to make things like that herself and feels threatened. Her daughter is at an age where they can say hurtful things without realising it and she\u2019s probably just feeling the pressure. \n\nMy suggestion would be to make it clear to her daughter you can only make time for cooking because you don\u2019t have a million other things to do like her mum (even if you do, play it up a bit). Also maybe don\u2019t assume your SIL has the time/energy to cook the way you do and if you want to buy food for them maybe prepare it yourself or something?", "NAH. You're doing loads to help. SIL is probably very stressed and feels judged. Good luck.", "YTA, specifically for this:\n\n> I told her as such and called her ungrateful for throwing out my groceries and that she should be thankful her daughter is eating well. That did not end well and I heard her start crying on the other end before just hanging up on me.\n\nShe's a newly single mom who is working a minimum wage job. She's under an incredible amount of stress and probably already feels guilty as shit for not being able to provide more for her kid. \n\nAlso, mapo tofu? Does she even know where to get the doubanjiang paste you need for that? Maybe if you already shop at an asian grocery store, but we can't assume that. Does she even know how to make it? Peking duck? Are you serious? You expect a working single mom to have the time to make peking duck. Imagine this was school or something. She's already struggling. And you're sending her extra homework and telling her she should be grateful.\n\nYou're doing a kind thing by trying to look out for the kid. You are. But you need a serious reality check on your expectations. If you want to help, ask her what she needs. If you want to feed her kid, ask her if it's okay for you to prepare fridge food. Send her kid home with a casserole they can eat for four nights; don't make her have to google how to make mapo tofu after she gets home from an 8-hour shift.", "YTA I get it, I love to cook and my niece and nephew love cooking with me. But the reality is that not everyone -even if they have the time - likes it as much. Being exhausted after a long shift and waking up 3 times in the night because your kid is crying doesn't help with that.\n\nGo to the dollar store and get some foil containers with lids. Then spend some time with your niece and make some meals you can freeze. Homemade chicken noodle soup (and make the stock together if that's fun for you) - put it in a freezer bag. Lasagna,  pineapple chicken,  pot pie. You like to cook, you know where I'm going with this. Have some for lunch, the rest gets freezed and send it back with your neice. \n\nIf you want to help with meals then don't send ingredients, send the meal! Your sister will appreciate being able to pull out dinner and pop it in the oven after a long day and you know your nice will love it! And every once in a while send brownies or apple crumble.", "I'd say either NAH or ESH\n\nYou have good intentions and nutrional food is indeed important.\n\nHowever I think you fail to see this from your SIL's perspective.\n\nBecause as nice as it is that you purchased those ingredients for her, their are several concerns.\n- Does she even know how to cook with them herself?\n- what if your help disappears? For whatever reason.\nShe'll be stuck with a child who doesn't want to eat anymore or where she can't afford the food her kid wants.\n\nYour SIL probably could've voiced her concerns better instead of berating you over the phone.", ">When I first started babysitting my niece, my SIL instructed her favorite foods were \"frozen chicken nuggets and fries\" and she insisted that she'd be happy if I fed her that every meal.\n\nI hope you realize that's not *typical* of poor households, even if it's not necessarily uncommon. \\*Every\\* meal?\n\nSorry, but I think YTA. I think you went overboard in your food project (fish and duck? That sounds pretty darn expensive to me) without involving her mother at all. No, I am not convinced you buying groceries is involving her, I don't even hear of anything she thinks or says until the three days ago.", "YTA, gently (or ESH, I suppose, because the SIL reacted so badly). I get you mean well. Went through something similar myself with much nieces and nephew. \n\nBut you don't get to take it upon yourself to gift food to your SIL and then berate her for what she did with it. Nothing stressed me out more than when my mother did this, however well intentioned, because my ability to do something with the food on the schedule it required use put a seriously bent in my days. She doesn't have full evenings like you do to prepare more meals. She's tired and she has to take care of the house and kid and she just might not *like* or be skilled at cooking. That's not even getting into the underlying judgment both in your actions to her and what you said.\n\nShe's doing the best she can. She *cannot* feed her daughter exactly like you are. And her kid is now refusing to eat what she can handle. You both need to handle that better. Yes, she shouldn't have scolded you for widening her kid's taste buds, but your response was wildly aggressive and hurtful. Why?? \n\nA kid is gonna be okay with chicken and fries some nights. You're already feeding her an expanded diet the others, and by teaching the kid good meal habits, she's liable to someday take on that effort herself. A better way of going about this would have been to ask your SIL why it was causing issues and open the way for her to express her anxieties, so that you could help her overcome them and offer to teach her a few dishes she can then make with her kid, or to work a fun spin on chicken and fries into your time with her to refreshen the dish and bring bring back out of purgatory.  Or some very quick and easy recipes that won't put an impossible dent in her pocket book. Just buying her groceries she didn't ask for, for meals she likely doesn't know how to make and can't afford again, with an obvious air of \"I'm doing this better than you\" is... not helpful.\n\nYour heart is in the right place and I love that you're doing this for your niece. You *are* doing a kindness. But don't weaponize that against her. Not cool.", "INFO: have you ever said to your niece that chicken nuggets are not a good food choice and your meals are much better?\n\nEven once? \n\nMore often?\n\nCould that be why she is refusing to eat that with her mum anymore?", "At the end of the day, if you\u2019re watching someone\u2019s kid you have to follow the guidelines the parent sets. That goes for bed times, food, tv time etc. Guidelines though, not rules. You can give her some healthy extras along with her meals or have the occasional day of something \u201cnew\u201d to eat. \n\nYou accidentally started an \u201cauntie food good, mom food bad\u201d divide. Which can quickly evolve into \u201cauntie house good, mom house bad\u201d and it snowballs from there. \n\nThis is common when split parents have the arrangement where every 2nd weekend the kid stays at the fathers house and he tries to make up for the lack of time with lots of fun activities and ice cream and staying up past bedtime. The father becomes the fun one and it makes life for the mother hell even though he has only good intentions. That\u2019s why consistency is so important for kids that age", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think if things smooth over soon and she's still open to me babysitting, I might try to cook extra and help her meal prep. I also work full-time so I don't have the time to prep my niece's every meal at home, but a few lunches/dinners I could definitely do.\n\nTo answer your question though, I only sent those groceries because to my knowledge, my SIL cooks breakfast and lunches for my niece (she works afternoon & night shift). On the weekends, my niece told me they like to make brunch & dinner together. I assumed because of this that my SIL has time to cook and prepare food, which is why I sent groceries.", "Theres a crazy amount of simple health dishes that take 5 to 10 minutes max to cook. Cooking is not only for people with easy lives and free schedules, and the notion that whoever is going a tough time only has the option of instant food is false.", "SIL didn't ask for the food. OP gifted her another chore on top of all of her other responsibilities. OP didn't ask her, didn't offer to meal prep for her, didn't even offer her the recipes she used. She just sent food OP felt was appropriate and expected her SIL to one, know how to prepare it and two, have the time to prepare it.", "Yeah, I was thinking of helping her meal prep a few meals, but I just wouldn't have the time to meal prep every single one of my niece's meals. I also assumed she cooks because my SIL told me that she cooks weekday breakfast/lunches for my niece as well as weekend meals. My niece told me she enjoys cooking with her mom too so I didn't wanna take that away from them by sending her back with only my food.", "I do feel the need to clarify that I do NOT at all expect her to cook anything elaborate or time consuming, like Peking duck. I cook my niece more \"plain\" things all the time too like rice, steamed veggies, and chicken (just with lots of seasoning!). She loves that too. Those things are fairly easy to make as well and I know 100% my SIL is capable of doing that when she cooks for my niece.", "Did you miss the part about SIL *throwing out gifted food*?! \n\nShe\u2019s apparently not so poor that she can\u2019t afford to just throw out perfectly decent food.", "No 5 yr old is eating ma po tofu. Shits SPICY.", "Let's not make excuses - SIL is a sub par parent. You can cook simply and cheaply and *healthy*. Fried foods with such limited nutritional value at every meal is effed up, especially for a growing child. Fair enough if the child refused anything other than nuggets but it's not the case, clearly.\n\nYes, she's in a tough spot but that's not OPs fault...why bite the hand that's actually helping you and taking care of your child? Why throw away perfectly good groceries? If you can't cook anything then *learn* - you're a parent now and that's a basic skill. Any parent should know how to actually feed their child, not just air fry frozen shit. No single parent has an abundance of time but it's a choice to make that little extra effort.", "Did you send stuff that Sil was familiar with?\n\nShe might make brunch/lunch but that can vary wildly. \n\nMy in-laws buy and cook fresh food, but I can definitely tell you there are fresh foods that we use regularly that if I sent them they would likely not know what to do with, and it would likely spoil. \n\nWe cook fresh food, but also tend to have a general rotation/selection of foods we use. We do try new things but that usually takes a lot more time to research, shoo for, plan and cook. \n\nYour heart is in the right place, but your execution could be better. \n\nI 100% second inviting both over for cooking nights, and or to meal prep.", "That\u2019s really good to know! I think you are definitely a great influence in your niece\u2019s life, and I think you should continue trying to help with her diet, but I am very sympathetic to your SIL as a struggling single mother. I\u2019m sure an honest conversation and an offer of a helping hand will go a long way. You\u2019re a great aunt, and I hope you remain a strong influence in your niece\u2019s life.", "This is a really interesting article you might find useful (i think you need to register but you get a few free articles each month).

I think OP could make some simple dishes at home like steamed veggies or just a normal soup atleast on some days instead of cooking up something fancy on such a frequent basis. Idk I just feel like SIL is so intimidated by OP's skill level that she's too scared to even try and is just throwing up her hands in the air. I understand she *shouldnt* be doing that but at the end of the day she is human and she's dealing with a broken relationship,  hectic working hours, and exhaustion herself.", "For a good cook, yes. For someone who has never learned to cook they can take way longer and (if they don't turn out right) result in waste you cannot afford if you're on a low income. And be incredibly stressful.\n\nI agree with you, by the way. But some people live different lives.", "I only sent those groceries because my SIL told me she cooks breakfast and lunches for my niece (she works afternoon & night shift). On the weekends, my niece told me they like to make brunch together. I assumed because of this that my SIL has time to cook and prepare food at certain times, which is why I sent groceries. I also did not send overly fancy/difficult things to cook. Mostly just fresh veggies (i.e., pre-packaged salad mixes), fresh meats, and grains.", "This sounds as if you're backpedalling from the examples given in your post. Perhaps when you plan what you cook for your niece, you could take budget and time into account as well as nutrition. \n\nVegetable soups, simple pastas, dishes based on veg protein/small quantities of meat; things you can cook 4 or more serves of - eat one with your niece and send two home with her (not every time, but occasionally). \n\nWhat SIL is capable of cooking and what she has the energy for right now may be two quite different things. Talk to her.", "In that case, I retract my rant about Peking duck, apologies for that. But I still think you should apologize for unloading on her like that and send her casseroles or other fridge food if you want to make sure they're eating right.", "Yes, I definitely did. No fancy fish or ducks at all, mostly just veggies (salad mixes, pre cut veggies, etc.) and meats (chicken breast, ground beef, sausage). I know she has an air fryer that she likes using so I made sure most stuff was air fryer friendly.", "That was very kind and thoughtful of you to send her foods that you thought she\u2019d use. I like one of the ideas of doing some meal prep for her or what about even simplifying the food you cook for your niece, while it\u2019s still nutritious? Maybe your SIL also feels that her cooking ability isn\u2019t as good as yours and the food you make your niece is too complicated/takes too much time.", "Thank you! Yes, I think that's a good compromise. In the future, I may try to simplify the food a bit more. It's mostly the case when I cook really big fancy meals (e.g., the Peking duck), it's usually for me and my husband to enjoy for dinner, but since my niece has no issues eating this \"adult\" food, I just began making her a plate too, which she loves."]}
