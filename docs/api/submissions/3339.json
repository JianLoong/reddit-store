Only with future partners.", "NTA - He should be afraid to ask you for anything involving a skillet after making you mad by his comments :)\n\nSeriously though, You NEED to pay attention to the huge red flag he is waving!  He isn't treating you well at all.", "NTA he actually said no? WTAF?\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to do the whole weaponized incompetence thing but this dude just flat out says no? That\u2019s fucking precious. \n\nBye boi! \n\nYou want to sign up for that long term? That\u2019s not a partner, that\u2019s an entitled brat.", "NTA\n\nRUN\n\nHe's not ever going to help, you know this now. \n\nUnless he's cooking for you at his place and cleaning everything as well.\n\nBut seriously, this is the beginning of him really leaning into the \"traditional\" roles. If you don't want to sign up for that, leave while it is easy.\n\nKeep in mind, when dating, any reason you want to leave is a perfectly fine one. Trust yourself on this, if it is feeling off.", "NTA- Serious red flags here. If he is refusing to help now, if you two end up getting married or living together down the road, he's going to be just as bad or worse in this regard. Most people go by the rule of one person cooks, one cleans in these types of situations (it was what I ALWAYS did when dating someone and over at their place or vice versa) and the fact that he's using the excuse of being a \"guest\" is something that you shouldn't be taking lightly. Given the fact he asked you to make him more food is worrisome because it sounds like he's already trying to groom you to be his cook and maid for the future. I would sit down with him and discuss this with him. If it was me and I was your age, I would probably break up with him honestly. Life's too short for someone who won't help me out with a reasonable request.", "He's showing you right now who he is. He's never going to change, it will only get worse. It might not seem like a big deal to you now but it will in the future. Such behaviour is breeding ground for resentment. Do you really want to put up with such stuff for the rest of your life?\n\nNta but if i were you I would look for someone better.", "Absolutely NTA. If this guy wants to play the guest card, unless he was raised in a barn, the polite thing to do as a \u201cguest\u201d is to offer to help your \u201chost\u201d. And the fact his expectation when he comes over is that you should just wait on him constantly is a rather glaring red flag.", "NTA - there\u2019s a giant red flag waiving on the play. If he\u2019s unwilling to help with something so simple how\u2019s he going to act later on?", "I had a boyfriend who wouldn\u2019t help clean even though he was at my house all the time and even did his laundry there. I\u2019m better off without him. He never changed.", "NTA and please do the next girl a favor and let him know exactly why you are dumping him.", "NTA and honestly OP I think you should get out while you still can. If you put up with this behavior you\u2019re going to be taking care of a child in marriage. When we first started dating my husband always insisted he help with cleaning and even would clean everything when my mom made us dinner when we had family dinners. And you didn\u2019t even ask him to clean! Just a 2 minute task of putting away dishes. I\u2019d have put that \u201ccookie skillet\u201d where the sun don\u2019t shine.\n\nAlso tho drop that recipe if you have it", "NTA. Are you sure he\u2019s 30 and not 10? How entitled and rude of him to expect to be waited on while refusing to help out in any capacity. \nReevaluate the relationship because it sounds like you deserve a lot better than him. Just because he\u2019s a guest doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s incapable of giving you a hand when you need one. His behavior will not change if you ever decide to move in together.", "NTA\nYou deserve way better", "NTA- Question: why are you busting your butt for someone who refuses to return the favour? \ud83d\udea9 It\u2019s not going to get better, sis.", "NTA\n\nWhoa. His response is not okay.\n\nA relationship takes effort from both sides. It seems from what you're saying here that you are the only one making an effort.", "NTA. He's telling you what to expect in the future. He doesn't intend to help you with household chores. Ever.", "Well most important things first, thanks for introducing me to cookie skillets, I know what Im about to go and cook now!\n\nSecond, absolute lols at your boyfriend's entitlement. \n\nExtrapolate this out to whatever future you might have thought about seeing with this man. You want to move in with this attitude? Have kids with this attitude? Make a life with someone who expects you to make him little treats while he flat out refuses to lift a finger?\n\nSuccessful relationships, in the long term, don't really come down to how crazy you are/were about each other when you're young, they don't come down to butterflies in the stomach, or romance. They come down to how you get through the little difficulties of the day to day together. Key word being *together*. \n\nDo you know how many marriages end over housework?  A *lot*. Because ten/twenty/thirty years of being taken advantage of domestically takes it's toll. As it should, because one partner is treating the other like a servant and love can't survive that. \n\nI know I know it sounds like a lot of drama to put on one meal and a cookie skillet. But that is absolutely how it starts.", "You know you\u2019re NTA. \n\nLook, I\u2019ll give you permission: dump him. He\u2019s a loser.", "Nta. Dude sounds like a dud.", "NTA. HUGE red flag!  This is a glimpse into a marriage with him!", "NTA - At a certain point you've been over enough and been together long enough that you no longer considered a guest, exactly.\n\nWho cooks/cleans at his?", "NTA. Forthwith- I\u2019d be cooking for only one now and it ain\u2019t him.", "NTA. Stop cooking for him. Just because he\u2019s a guest doesn\u2019t mean you wait on him hand and foot. He is your boyfriend FFS. You\u2019re in a relationship. He is an AH.", "There are a lot of other things that \u201cguests\u201d generally don\u2019t get that I\u2019m sure he will miss if that\u2019s how he sees himself.", "NTA. Major red flag. First of all, guest or not guest it is polite to help, this is even worst if you are in a relationship with the person in question. Secondly, his reasoning does not make sense, if his reason for not helping is because he is a guest and guest do not help, then as a guest he should not ask the host to go out of their way to make anything, just plain rude. Seriously, this man sounds immature, is going to takes advantage of you at any chance he gets, and if he is now like that think what he will be like if you become his wife/life long partner.", "NTA. What does he do in your relationship to keep it a balanced partnership? If I was even at a friend\u2019s house as a guest and they asked me to help I\u2019d say yes because why wouldn\u2019t I want to make their life easier if they need my help, especially if it\u2019s in relation to something I\u2019m benefiting in.", "NTA  your BF is though. Does he also think women should be barefoot, pregnant and bring him his pipe and slippers at the end of the day? \n\nYou deserve way better", "NTA. Don't ever move in with this guy.", "Obviously NTA. What a jerk really. He should be asking what he can do to help, not waiting for you to ask him.", "NTA Who cooks doesn\u2019t clean isn\u2019t an unusual arrangement.  Someone\u2019s mommy do to much for him?", "NTA. I hope this isn\u2019t a theme throughout the rest of your relationship. Especially if you\u2019re willing to give more than he is.", "NTA. He thinks you are going to pick up where his mother left off. The sooner you free him of this delusion, the better.", "NTA. Leave his ungrateful ass. This is a BIG red flag", "NTA. 1-3 visits is a guest. If hes slept in your home, or been there 5+ times in a 6 month period, dude can help out.", "NTA.\n\nI won\u2019t jump straight to saying y\u2019all need to break up without a bunch more info about your relationship, but I definitely think you need to have a serious conversation about expectations.\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t live together/share a home at the moment, but you\u2019re a partnership. Partners support each other. It\u2019s not like you asked him to do something insane or excessively tedious (like reorganize your closet or something). Man can do the damn dishes", "\"I asked him for help and he said no.\"\nRead that a couple of times over. You asked your boyfriend for help and he flat out said no. Oh my god, seriously?\nYou asked him for help. He refused you. And you think you're an asshole for asking for help? Nope. NTA.", "NtA.   Bf not even trying to score points by helping is not a  good sign.  Hope you didn\u2019t make cookies.", "As others have said - NTA and this guy is waving red flags. Not long term material. If he is hesitant to help and tries to get you to do more for him now, it will only get worse in the future. He seems very self-centered.\n\nAlso, a note on pre-conceived cultural roles within relationships and families. Lots of people have subconscious expectations for what a man should do and what a female should do in a relationship and a family. At the end of the day, what works in your relationship is for you to decide. But, I think an unwillingness to contribute while still expecting to benefit is a bad sign, be it a man or a woman. Relationships and marriages work best when two people can be a team.", "NTA. This is a red flag. Please leave him. \n\nWhen I\u2019m a guest in someones house i always help out to clean, doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m a guest. Guests Doesn\u2019t mean a burden on the hosts. \n\nWhat excuse would he have when he gets married? That its not his job because he is a man? Or because he worked all day and he is tired? Like what the actual fuck. And the audacity to ask for more, this is crazy.", "Nta. He is showing you a glimpse of the future.
