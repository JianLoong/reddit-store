You can sell the house to her, but for the love of god, sell it for what it\u2019s worth.\n\nHer contributions, if any, to housing expenses should have been no more than her half of what a fair market rent would have been for the house you lived in together, and they were rent. They did not buy her any equity in your house.", "We use my VA loan, so no down payment. She did surprise me while I was on deployment by repainting our basement and decorating it, but outside of that she doesn\u2019t have equity in it. She did pay $850 in rent.

You\u2019re in a great financial position right now and it would be a bad move to walk away from your investment without profiting off of it. \n\nTalk to local realtors and property managers now and decide how you want to move forward when you have to PCS or deploy. \n\nIs your house located in a place you\u2019d live after the military? If so, holding on to it and renting it out is also smart. The rent would likely cover the mortgage and maybe you\u2019d even have extra to put away for inevitable expenses like new carpeting between tenants and maybe some fresh paint or appliance replacement. \n\nYou made a smart financial move.

It\u2019s yours to do with as you please.", "Ahh don\u2019t even let her live there. Separate. And what does renting \u201cat cost\u201d mean? The costs of home ownership are incredibly complex and honestly have very little to do with what people THINK of as the cost of home ownership: the mortgage.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to pull your heartstrings to obtain a small (or large) payday for herself.", "So work out a fair overall division of assets than reflects what each of you actually contributed to the household rather than solely who\u2019s name is on it.", "Especially since I got the house at 2% interest. Right now you can\u2019t really get less than 6. The area is honestly one of the few places I lived that I want to raise a family.

That seems more fair than her getting the whole house", "Oh gosh, yeah. No, no, no. Hold on to your investment. Unsolicited advice: talk seriously to a few property management companies and find out which one you trust to make sure your home is respected and taken care of. We rented our house out for a PCS and it was the wisest financial choice of our marriage as it really set us up for our future. Good luck!", "Wow this makes it even more obvious. Not only should you not sell it for $40k less than it\u2019s worth, you shouldn\u2019t even sell it for. $40k MORE than it\u2019s worth. That mortgage is bliss. Never ever pay any more than you need to against it.", "If and when you want to sell the house, you could offer to sell it to her at fair market value. You may even be able to find a realtor that will cut you a deal on the commission since you\u2019ll have a buyer lined up and will only need the paperwork done. You could choose split this savings with her 50/50, pass it all to her, or keep it for yourself.", "Are you open at all to figuring out an equitable value for her to buy you out of the house that reflects her contributions to it?  You say you think fair is her taking half of the joint account and that\u2019s it, but don\u2019t even say how that joint account was funded.\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to care about that house as a home, but clearly she does.  You don\u2019t actually have to be a jerk to her just because you guys are breaking up.", "I offered to just sell the house and split the proceeds, but she really wants the house", "Chill out, clearly you\u2019re missing something. I still live in the house and need somewhere to live. I put the house in my name man. Of course I care about my home. I don\u2019t know where you got the impression that I don\u2019t. \n\nBut what\u2019s an equitable split in this situation to you?

Even if she takes you up on this offer, do NOT DO IT!", "I don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t know how your finances were arranged during your relationship.  Like that joint bank account - how was it funded and what was it used for?", "Her rent money went into that account and was not touched", "It was treated almost as an emergency fund for us", "If she was paying rent, she was contributing financially to paying for the house.  But it\u2019s awfully big of you to let her keep only half of her money in the joint account.\n\nYTA.", "Then what do you recommend?", "NTA. If she's paid anything toward the house, you might consider offering that amount back to her when you sell it for market value. But let's be clear - you would not be \"leaving at least $40,000 in equity behind\" - you'd be giving your ex a gift of $40,000 in equity. I'd say it's even odds that she turns right around and sells it to crystallize that equity right into her bank account.", "NTA. You aren't married. She isn't entitled to anything. It's a house you bought on your own. She does not get shit. Tell her no and tell her to move out. Legally she has no leg to stand on any more than a renter demanding the same of their landlord.", "She was a tenant.  She has no rights to it.  \n\nBreak up and tell her to move or she will be evicted.  \n\nSell the house normally.  If she wants it then she can bid on it like everyone else.  \n\nNTA", "I think the bigger question here is why you're even considering it. 95% of other people would laugh, scream \"hell no\" and hang up, but for some reason you think you should give your life savings away simply because someone requested it? \n\nSay no, cut contact and then find a nice therapist to help increase confidence and self worth.", "Just so you know, if you do this for her, you\u2019re directly hurting yourself. You paid all the bills for the time you were together so she saved the equivalent of four years rent.\n\nYou must be a people pleaser to a very high degree to hurt yourself to help her. This isn\u2019t a fair ask and she\u2019s applying heavy pressure and it\u2019s implied that she won\u2019t be happy with you. I wouldn\u2019t be happy with her being willing to harm me to help herself.\n\nShe\u2019s not your friend, she can have it at fair market value or nothing. Get an ironclad agreement and don\u2019t leave anything to chance. Frankly I would sell it to someone else.", "NTA there are certain situations where it\u2019s make sense to consider taking a hit (though not that large of a hit). Like if you shared a child together and the house was in a great school district and close to your family support systems \u2014 in that case, a smaller hit could be worth the benefit to the child. But that\u2019s not what this is at all. As long as she wasn\u2019t a complete ass of a partner, you could say she could have first dibs at market value.", "Ok, not married", "If you want to sell it's at going rate not cost. NTA up to her if she wants to paygoing rate or not.", "INFO\n\nSo you looked for a house *together*, yet you are the owner. What made the two of you decide not to puy it on both names? \n\nHow did you come up with the way you split the money, her paying rent, essentially? \n\n\n>she does pay $850/mo into a joint account. The account was recently opened so most of the money from the first two years is of course not in there. I do intend to give her the account\n\nSo the first two years, did that money go to the mortage? Or where?\nAnd the last year? All saved?", "Typically, when a business partnership ends there's a shotgun clause.\n\nOne partner makes an offer to buy the other out.  The offer can be accepted, or matched.  If you match the offer, then you get to buy her half for the price she offered you for yours.\n\nTell her to sharpen her pencil and make an offer she'd be willing to take for her half.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why are you even letting your ex influence your mind? She's your ex, so her opinions and thoughts mean nothing to you. \n\nYou can make an extra 40K by selling it to someone else? Well, she better pay up or that someone else will get to buy it.\n\nEdit: I now see down below you got a great deal on your house in terms of loan. Keep that house, you're going to be thankfull in a year or 10-15.\n\nDon't let your former emotions for her judge your thinking today.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! Like I thought it was fair to just sell the house and split the proceeds even though, if we\u2019re both being honest, I\u2019m not legally required to. Not to mention have you ever left a break up making money? I personally feel like I\u2019m doing everything I can to be fair to her, but she wants it all", "Bot account stealing comments I think", "You tried to be fair. I would send her the eviction letter, withdraw your half of the money from the joint account and be done with it.", "Definitely. Ripped off one of OPs own comments. Report and downvote!", "then do not sell", "NTA\n\nIf it's your home base do not sell. Not even at market. \n\nAlso never sell at cost. You paid intrest on the loan, tax on the property and paid for upkeep. That should be a factor.", "Don\u2019t do it! She\u2019s **not** entitled to your hard work renovating the house or your VA loan benefits. \n\nMy suggestion? Give her a 60 day notice via email, so you have a record of it. In the notice, be sure to include that eviction proceedings will begin on day 61 and follow through. \n\nOP, since she\u2019s the one who wanted to pay what she paid while renting (not half the mortgage), and you paid all utilities and upkeep, she was *renting* from you. So she painted a few walls, big deal. If professional painters get $40+K for that, we\u2019d all be scrambling for that job. She\u2019s now trying to take advantage of your generous nature. You\u2019ve tried (what I believe to be) *very* generous compromises, and she won\u2019t have it. Stand your ground. \n\nAn aside, OP: I\u2019m a woman, and her sense of entitlement really makes me angry. No man owes a woman anything except basic common decency. Personally, I would be so ashamed of myself if the type of behavior your ex is exhibiting even crossed my mind."]}
