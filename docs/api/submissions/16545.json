{"id": 16545, "submission_id": "139um6c", "title": "AITA for being embarrassed of my girlfriend's cosplay?", "selftext": "My (25M) GF (24) had a double mastectomy 5 years ago; she had breast cancer, and thankfully made a full recovery. Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery. This was before I met her. \n\nI'm a big anime nerd, and last weekend I invited her to a small anime con with me. She's seen a few episodes of my favorite shows, but she's not into anime; she does like cosplay, though, and she works seasonally as an SFX artist at a haunted house near us. So when I asked her to go to the con with me, she asked if she could cosplay, and I said sure. She got very excited and said I was going to love her costume, so I'll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me.\n\nWell, not exactly. The day of the convention comes, and she showed up at my house cosplaying Dabi from MHA- specifically a look he has later in the manga. It's a long white coat over white pants, no shirt. Her entire chest was exposed and she'd obviously spent hours applying burn makeup; she has short hair that she dyes constantly, this time she bleached it white and dyed a few red streaks. \n\nI wasn't expecting her to show up without a shirt. Her burn scar makeup only covered half her chest, so you could clearly see her mastectomy scar. It wasn't a verry attractive costume, especially since she'd gone all out with the scars and made them look raised and kind of realistic. \n\nWe went to the con, and while a lot of people came up to take photos with her, I noticed several others looking at her chest. That evening, she said I'd been quiet all day, and I honestly told her I was a little embarrassed that she was flaunting her mastectomy scar like that. She got mad and said she was making the best of her situation and said I was being insensitive, and she's been distant ever since. I'm starting to feel guilty.

It's very thoughtful of her, and she's clearly very talented and was excited for you to see her costume, because she expected you'd think that her craftsmanship was amazing -- based on the con's reactions, I'd say it probably was. \n\nYou don't seem to appreciate her for the person she is, and expect a lot out of her in very superficial ways. Grow up, it's an incredibly childish way to feel about the entire thing. Maybe you're not meant for her if you can't handle her just being a person outside of the traditional femininity that you find attractive.", "Oh, how dare your GF not have a *pretty* little cosplay outfit. Obviously she has not gotten the message that her only worth is if she caters to the male gaze. (s)\n\nYeaaa. YTA", "YTA, and she should find someone who actually likes her.  Thankfully, it seems like she's figured that out.", "YTA and a massive one.\n\nScars are part of our lives and hers show she fought and survived.

First, you\u2019re not entitled to a gf dressing in \u201csexy\u201d cosplay, or anything for that matter. She can cosplay however she chooses. Second, you didn\u2019t even tell her how cool of a cosplay that was? How much time and talent it takes to integrate SFX makeup into actual scars that come from one of the most vulnerable, debilitating times of her life - fucking CANCER?!?

I'm starting to feel guilty. \n\nBeing familiar with Dabi, YTA yes I think so.\n\nI absolutely agree with you that she was flaunting her scar--cosplay *is* flaunting. Your girlfriend has involuntarily had her gendered figure altered. That makes her options for flaunting herself very limited. I think you should recognized that and had it firmly in mind before you said ANYTHING.\n\nOn second thought.

This woman is so brave. She deserves much better than you.", "YTA. You should be happy that she's confident in her body to go in this cosplay to an event. \nWhy are you embarrassed?

Kudos to her to being to comfortable with herself after such a traumatic experience and surgery.", "YTA WHY should she hide her scars? She\u2019s a survivor and a fucking warrior and you\u2019re embarrassed? Ew. Shame on you.", "YTA and I knew it as soon as you said, \"Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery\" and confirmed it when you thought she was going to wear something sexy \"for me.\" Women are not there to dress sexy (or not) for men or anyone else. You were only embarrassed because you thought you would be able to show her off like some sort of trophy. \n\nGood for her for doing what *she* felt comfortable and confident doing, and it sounds like she rocked it. Using her real scars to complete the cosplay is not flaunting anything, it's just owning it and is honestly powerful to see. I hope she continues to do things for herself that make her happy and not to try to make her (hopefully soon-to-be ex) partner or anyone else happy. If anyone, including you, was uncomfortable by her cosplay, that's their problem, not hers.", "People staring at her chest? Um, yeah. I looked up the character you're talking about, and that part of the costume looks like it would be by far the hardest part to pull off. They are probably looking and taking notes on how to do it in future. \n\nI guarantee you, not one person besides **you** is looking at her mastectomy scars. She found a costume that made her feel good showing off that part of her body, something she probably has felt self-conscious about ever since the surgery. And you ruined that good feeling for her and turned it into something ugly. But I think the line that got me the most was \"I thought she was going to do something sexy for me\" and \"It wasn't a very attractive costume.\" You had to rain on her parade because it was something that wasn't **for you,** huh? YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re not embarassed of the cosplay, you\u2019re embarassed of her scars. Why should she be ashamed of her scars to make you feel better? Beating cancer is no small feat", "YTA. You weren\u2019t embarrassed by the costume/cosplay, you were embarrassed by the scars. You should be proud of her, proud of them being a symbol of her still being here and proud that she feels confident enough to have them on display. \n\nOther people looking is their problem, and you making her feeling any ounce of shame makes you a massive asshole.", "I have breast cancer. The fear I felt over the potential loss of my breasts was unlike anything. Worse, for me, than being infertile or losing my hair. I align with my gender, my breast were MINE. Sure, they fell into my armpits when I lay down\u2026 but they were MINE. And I was going to lose them. I couldn\u2019t even begin to comprehend how that would ever feel, how I would ever be able to look at my body and recognise it again.\n\nThe fact your girlfriend A) survived breast cancer and B) had the courage, self assuredness and confidence to have a mastectomy without reconstruction is an incredible achievement and an unbelievable, radical choice that is one of the most difficult some of us will ever have to make and what did you do\u2026?? You belittled her. You thought she looked unattractive. You took something that changes someone\u2019s life FOREVER in a way they will never have control over again and you SHAMED her for it.

This is so much more meaningful than sexiness. She showed you she was willing to play with her own identity and survivorship in an arena that is your thing. \n\nAnd you were disappointed. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re insensitive, it\u2019s that you are entirely clueless and shallow.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy (25M) GF (24) had a double mastectomy 5 years ago; she had breast cancer, and thankfully made a full recovery. Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery. This was before I met her. \n\nI'm a big anime nerd, and last weekend I invited her to a small anime con with me. She's seen a few episodes of my favorite shows, but she's not into anime; she does like cosplay, though, and she works seasonally as an SFX artist at a haunted house near us. So when I asked her to go to the con with me, she asked if she could cosplay, and I said sure. She got very excited and said I was going to love her costume, so I'll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me.\n\nWell, not exactly. The day of the convention comes, and she showed up at my house cosplaying Dabi from MHA- specifically a look he has later in the manga. It's a long white coat over white pants, no shirt. Her entire chest was exposed and she'd obviously spent hours applying burn makeup; she has short hair that she dyes constantly, this time she bleached it white and dyed a few red streaks. \n\nI wasn't expecting her to show up without a shirt. Her burn scar makeup only covered half her chest, so you could clearly see her mastectomy scar.

It took far more guts for your girlfriend to trust guys enough to start dating men after her surgery then it did for her to wear this costume.  For every guy like you,  there are a hundred who would have heard the words \u201cbreast cancer, took one look at her figure and run the other way.  For that you get some credit. Everyone can act outraged for you admitting you were uncomfortable and tell you they hope she dumps you and find someone better.  But that is crap.  You are in a relationship with a cancer survivor.  But it is still a relationship of two people.  Her history doesn\u2019t mean that only her feelings are valid and yours are not.

Maybe if she\u2019d expressed why this was so important up front you would have been more comfortable.

Being told you have cancer is the scariest thing you can imagine. I cannot even fathom getting that news as a teenager like your girlfriend was! (I'm in my 50s, but I'm still not ready to have a life-threatening disease!)\n\nA mastectomy is a major surgery with lots of risks and an extremely painful recovery. And it's an amputation. Your girlfriend literally had to amputate part of her body, one that is inextricably associated with femininity and attractiveness. To lose that in her youth, when she is supposed to be at her peak attractiveness, had to have been devastating. I only had a lumpectomy \u2014 I got to keep my breast and nipple on the cancerous side, but it's got a big scar and a chunk taken out of it. At my age, I'm pretty damn confident, but even so, I'm self conscious about the scar and the discolored skin (from radiation) and the fact that I don't fill out my bra on one side the way I do on the other. It takes a sledgehammer to your self-esteem, on top of spending the rest of your life in fear that it will come back (There is ALWAYS a risk of recurrence. There's no such thing as permanently cured.)\n\nYour girlfriend probably didn't get reconstruction because that involves a second major surgery with those risks all over again. And because implants don't last forever, but usually have to be replaced after about 10 years. More surgery. So I can understand why she chose not to have them, but it's a shitty choice to have to make.\n\nBut she had the courage and self-confidence not only to show her scars, but to turn that symbol of a horribly traumatic experience into art! WOW...that is so cool! Have you considered that people were staring at her chest because they were awed and impressed by her strength and her skill?\n\nBut you want her to be embarrassed by her scars, as if they are somehow shameful. Why on earth should she be embarrassed by them? She hasn't done anything wrong. She didn't choose to get cancer. But she's making the best of the rotten hand she was dealt. And you're berating her for that.\n\nSo here's the important question I have for you: Why are you embarrassed by something she did? Her scars aren't about you. Her cosplay isn't a statement to the world about YOU. So why do YOU feel embarrassed? I think deep down you are ashamed that your girlfriend doesn't fit society's idea of a \"hot chick,\" and you feel your status is diminished by that. You want her to hide her deformity so people don't think of you as \"a guy who can only attract a boobless chick.\"\n\nBecause as a society, we largely only value women for their appearance. And we largely value men for their ability to attract good-looking women. That idea is reinforced on TV and in movies, in ads and in books. It's often subconscious even when we tell ourselves we don't think that way. It's worth bringing to light and consciously rejecting it though, because it damages and dehumanizes both men and women.\n\nYTA. You hurt your girlfriend very deeply, trying to make her feel bad about something she didn't choose and has had to work hard to make peace with. I hope you are able to apologize and work through your issues with her appearance, because they are YOUR issues, not hers.", "Literally every paragraph gets worse?

Because this is *your* body and choice, not your mother's.", "I\u2019m sure she definitely had other treatments, I was just saying she possibly didn\u2019t get to try other treatments first. My mum had her mastectomy before she started chemo or anything because of how aggressive her cancer was and it had already spread to her lymph nodes so it was a double mastectomy plus lymph node removal, treatment started after", "Cancer survivor here. I have 37 scars between my neck and my personal parts, including a long wide scar from my ribcage down to my bits. I also have numerous smaller scars in a big circle from laproscopic surgeries. I own every scar and am proud of every singleone. It takes a damn confident woman to make something funny from a masectomy scar. She is a freaking HERO.", "Or pouts at she didn\u2019t wear something sexy FOR HIM. Asshole.", "That\u2019s an insult to potatoes.", "Probably a breast plate, you can buy fake boobs. It\u2019s pretty common for cosplay of characters with *massive* honkers. \n\nBasically he probably wanted her to at least wear boobs if she wouldn\u2019t get new ones. \ud83d\ude44", "Obviously she would have gotten plastic surgery the day before the convention and then showed up with her new DDs in a sex schoolgirl outfit for his own enjoyment!!!!!\n\n\nOP, YTA.", "There are a bunch of (usually younger, female) characters that you can cosplay whose whole schtick is the fact that they don't have big boobs. \n\nin true anime fashion tho, if the character doesn't have big boobs, they're jealous of another character who does, they're insecure about their size, and they'll eventually sexually assault said big-boobed character in a shared bathroom scene or while wearing a school girl outfit.\n\nThis rant is unrelated to OPs situation, I'm just constantly mad at my favourite media source for continuing to be trash.", "That\u2019s why I mentioned the sailor moon outfit. It\u2019s all skimpy HOWEVER it does cover the chest region. I expect OP thought she\u2019d be too ashamed? Shy? To show off the scars and do a cosplay that had the chest covered but showed off other assets.", "Right?! Self-confidence is sexy as hell.", "I did, lots happened, but a main thing is that I can't pick up on some stuff", "That makes sense. Honestly I haven't looked into what a mammogram entails myself but like I said im nearing 27 so I should start now. As of now I feel like I should get it done at that age cause I trust my mother and her doctors judgment and would rather be safe than sorry. If they do find something it will obviously be up to me how they proceed.", "Right? Her courage has humbled the hell out of me and I don't even know her.", "Same! She sounds like the coolest MFer and op is not nearly in her league.", "And then, he would have want her to sometime just wear them for him. Then he would makes smalls comments about \"aren't you more cute and confident this way\" and lastly pressure for surgery.", "Ah!  I didn't have a good enough image of Sailor Moon in my head to realize she was one of the more \"tame\" ones!", "Yes, I think many women are choosing not to have reconstructive surgery after breast cancer. Society used to view women's bodies as objects to serve men, and this was reflected in the culture of Western medicine, and the way it treats our breasts, uteri, vaginas and vulvas.", "It's getting more common, because male doctors aren't shaming patients into getting reconstruction surgery.  There's also a lot of accounts of cancer survivors being left with the extra skin to force them to change their minds.", "Thank you for the reminder I had forgotten that when typing my comment.\n\nI totally agree I just looked up life span 10-20 for implants.  So I totally get when the thought of reconstructive surgery with a repeat in 10 years 20 year if lucky.  After you have went through what is really hard time with cancer treatment the thought of more surgery potentially when they don\u2019t settle or god forbid burst.\n\nI\u2019m sure without googling I saw regarding ongoing monitoring with implants is not as accurate.  \n\nI think though their is not one size fits all after going through all that your allowed to do what makes you and only you happy.  I can only hope op suddenly finds himself single and girlfriend gets an upgraded partner.", "I had a double mastectomy in September and implants done in February. It's all really a case by case basis. For me, having boobs was important and gender affirming. I admire those who go flat, that is confidence I do not have. I accepted the risks of capsular contracture, leaks, ect. My plastic surgeon said implants usually last much longer than 10 years. My grandmother just got her 1980s ones replaced.", ">\u201d\u2026so I\u2019ll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me.\u201d\n\nPretty isn\u2019t the rent women pay to exist in this world.  \n\nShe got excited, she wanted to do something WITH you even though she\u2019s not into anime and she pulled off an incredible amazing costume utilizing a traumatic event in her life and turning it into something to showcase her talent. \n\nHard YTA. \n\nCheck your misogyny while you\u2019re at it.", "Since this has been thoroughly answered, Tig Notaro filmed an HBO comedy special topless after a double mastectomy. I believe it was Boyish Girl Interrupted, if anyone is interested. Lots of people sound very inspired by this girl, so I thought I'd mention another amazing woman who's also incredibly funny.", "Ahhh yes because the event has to be about you, about sex, and again, about you. Your gf has every right to be the badass survivor she is and not just not hide her scars, but show them, as well. Hopefully she will see what an AH you are, break up with you, and then say, \u201cnope, no emotional scars after leaving that d-bag\u201d and then move on with her awesome life.", "Seriously. As a trans guy with chest scars fuck **ALL the way off bro.**\n\nHaving your body changed when you really want it (like trans guys who get chest masculinization) is super fucking hard and rocking the scars is something you learn to do with pride over time. It sucks - you have to love your body over the sound of other peoples side eyes.\n\n**Now imagine doing that when the surgery and scarring was 100% involuntary** - like a cancer survivor.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to be scared. She didn\u2019t want to fight for her life or confront her mortality. She probably didn\u2019t want to lose her breasts (maybe, who knows), and she didn\u2019t sign up for scars.\n\nBut she rolled with it, found a guy (you), engaged with him on his hobby at his con, and what did you do OP?\n\nYou shat on it.\n\nWay to go bro. You\u2019re the human equivalent of cops at a party. Break up with her.", "\"But I wanted a big titty sexy anime girlfriend:(\" is the vibe I'm getting. OP, spend less time ogling over cartoon women.

From the way he described it and the work she had to have out in for the makeup details, its was probably bad ass.\nOp is TA 1000%", "And the subtext beneath that selfishness, is \u201chow dare my gf not have pretty little breasts that she reserves for no one but *my*male gaze?\u201d \n\nAnd *also*, what about FTM too surgery?? Are no trans men (I don\u2019t even want to have to use the descriptor because trans men **are** men, full stop, but in this example the prefix might be less confusing?) allowed to cosplay bare-chested to appease OP\u2019s discomfort?? \n\nOP, as someone with a lot of \u2018unsightly\u2019 scars (from heart surgery, so clearly not the same freighted-ness, but still tangentially related) I can tell you with absolute certainty that getting to a place of not just *accepting* her scars, but *embracing* them, makes your gf one of the bravest, healthiest, most awesome and inspiring people ever, and you should be fvcking PROUD AS HELL that she\u2019s comfortable enough in her own body to pull off what sounds like an objectively badass costume. I guarantee you it took a **lot** of work for her to get to that point, and your reaction/discomfort probably unraveled a huge chunk of that hard work in a matter of seconds. All because *you* haven\u2019t dealt with *your* issues around *her* body. \n\nYou are absolutely YTA, and you owe her a massive apology after some serious, intensive, and thorough introspection. God, I just want to hug your gf!!!", "Exactly. This guy didn\u2019t get the memo that women don\u2019t exist solely to \u201clook pretty\u201d for men.", "How dare OP think her dressing up for *her* was for him!  \n\nOP is *sooo* angry that she dressed up like a character she likes the look of\u2026instead of something sexy for *him*. \n\nI think half his issue is that he wasn\u2019t the priority here! \n\nLOL\n\nYTA.", "The second he said, \u201cunlike a lot of women,\u201d\nI IMMEDIATELY knew", "You\u2019re girlfriend sounds amazing and you do not. By now, she probably knows she can do better than a boy who thinks cosplay is to look sexxxy for you. (Sexy cosplay is fine and fun, but to have that expectation of someone costuming just for you is \u2026 unevolved.)\n\nYTA and I hope you use this opportunity to grow as a person and to not be embittered by it.", "As my family and I say, sounds like an issue, not an ish-me \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "My coworker went on leave to get reconstructive surgery. She developed an infection that nearly killed her. I don't blame OPs girlfriend for not wanting to take that risk after all she had been through previously.", "Right? I wanna see this cosplay! I bet it looked cool as all hell", "Yes! When he was describing how her body totally fit the character I was thinking that this young lady is a genius.", "That is probably exactly why she chose that character. And I know nothing about anime. But she was so excited about it so she thought she had it down cold. This guy is such a tool. I\u2019m hoping she realizes this is a him not her problem.", "Just googled it. Her outfit sounds amazing, and would look very empowering to others.", "Also her cosplaying Dabi is cool as hell.", "Same. And I am not a fighter. At 19. 19! She had double mastectomy and now embracing her body. Not often I find a hero in AITA. OP is absolutely TA, a ridiculous one at that", "Literally!!!! I\u2019ve had my best interactions as cosplaying Dabi. People love it because it\u2019s such a difficult and intricate cosplay to pull off well", "I thought the same thing! Like this is one bad ass woman!!!!", "I have a total hang up on my scars. I\u2019m missing a finger and part of my hand and I\u2019m so used to holding my body in ways that hide it that when I talk about being an amputee or arthritis from the accident I was in people look at me confused. I love that she owns it. I hope to be there with her someday.", "I got a reduction and it was one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done for myself! Would definitely recommend.", "Try not to hate your large boobs. I'm also large-breasted and currently fighting breast cancer. It's amazing how facing the prospect of losing one or both of your breasts makes you appreciate them.  I'm one of the lucky ones and only need a lumpectomy, so I get to keep both breasts with some minor scarring on one side (surgery is next week). Despite the fact that I only need a relatively minor surgery to save my life, my breast surgeon has twice asked me if I'd like a full breast reduction (both sides) while I'm there! It's completely unnecessary - I said no thanks!", "I'm a breast cancer survivor who chose not to have reconstructive surgery and just hearing about OP's girlfriend and her cosplay is fucking EVERYTHING to me. My God, she deserves to be with someone who realizes and acknowledges how incredible she is. OP clearly isn't it.", "What hurts about his post is that she thought that he'd *love* it. She thought he'd appreciate the commitment to a character in a genre (it sounds like) he introduced her to. She clearly connects deeply enough to knowingly draw attention in an environment like that and be confident in her character choice. All of the work she put in, the time, the thought. And she thought OP would stand by her side confidently and happily. But he just wanted her to fulfill a fantasy. He expected a cat maid or magical girl in a miniskirt. It's gross on face value alone but my heart breaks just imagining all the admirable qualities she thought he had just slipping away in one word... \"Embarrassed\"\n\nOp - YTA. A pathetic stereotype, lacking in the depths of emotion that she thought you capable of. What a disappointment.", "I feel like there should be a poster of her on the wall of every breast cancer treatment place.", "I work in oncology and the amount of older women who choose to not get reconstructive surgery and opt for tattoos was more than I thought. I was just talking to a patient who wanted to get an outline of the butterfly process along her scars.", "'People looking at her chest' \n\nClearly does not occur to him that they might be in awe at how amazing the cosplay scars look. Especially judging by how I know from experience people flock to others wearing awesome costumes. (Am a huge nerd and went to the local Comic Con and saw so many amazing costumes.)", "Right?! Like it sounds like she put a lot of effort into her cosplay! Tbh I really want to see how her cosplay turned out (but also good OP didn't post pictures without getting gf's consent)", "Seriously, that was really creative!", "My daughter and her friend will sometimes deliberately wear the exact same shirt (each in their respective sizes) to call school staff out on their bullshit. My daughter is smaller in the chest area and wears a medium. Her friend is larger in the chest and wears an extra large. Otherwise the shirts will be identical. They will look at my daughter and tell her they like her top and then turn around and dress code the friend telling her to call her mom to bring her a change of clothes.", "I'm a BC survivor and I agree with you 1,000,000%. I adore this amazing warrior.", "He should buy his OWN boobs.
