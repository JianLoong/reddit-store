Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery. This was before I met her. \n\nI'm a big anime nerd, and last weekend I invited her to a small anime con with me. She's seen a few episodes of my favorite shows, but she's not into anime; she does like cosplay, though, and she works seasonally as an SFX artist at a haunted house near us. So when I asked her to go to the con with me, she asked if she could cosplay, and I said sure. She got very excited and said I was going to love her costume, so I'll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me.\n\nWell, not exactly. The day of the convention comes, and she showed up at my house cosplaying Dabi from MHA- specifically a look he has later in the manga. It's a long white coat over white pants, no shirt. Her entire chest was exposed and she'd obviously spent hours applying burn makeup; she has short hair that she dyes constantly, this time she bleached it white and dyed a few red streaks. \n\nI wasn't expecting her to show up without a shirt. Her burn scar makeup only covered half her chest, so you could clearly see her mastectomy scar. It wasn't a verry attractive costume, especially since she'd gone all out with the scars and made them look raised and kind of realistic. \n\nWe went to the con, and while a lot of people came up to take photos with her, I noticed several others looking at her chest. That evening, she said I'd been quiet all day, and I honestly told her I was a little embarrassed that she was flaunting her mastectomy scar like that. She got mad and said she was making the best of her situation and said I was being insensitive, and she's been distant ever since. I'm starting to feel guilty.

A list of things that make YTA:\n\n* expecting your girlfriend to cover her scars\n* expecting your girlfriend to dress as a woman\n* expecting your girlfriend to be doing a hobby that she enjoys, for your sexual gratification\n* expecting your girlfriend to be sad and mopey about her situation, and not make the best of something.\n* probably, based on how you've spoken, expecting your girlfriend to be traditionally feminine in a way that caters to your sexual interests.\n\nYour girlfriend is seemingly a very fun and creative person who put time and effort into doing something cool and fun to interact with your hobby and find a meeting point between your interests. It's very thoughtful of her, and she's clearly very talented and was excited for you to see her costume, because she expected you'd think that her craftsmanship was amazing -- based on the con's reactions, I'd say it probably was. \n\nYou don't seem to appreciate her for the person she is, and expect a lot out of her in very superficial ways. Grow up, it's an incredibly childish way to feel about the entire thing. Maybe you're not meant for her if you can't handle her just being a person outside of the traditional femininity that you find attractive.", "Oh, how dare your GF not have a *pretty* little cosplay outfit.

Thankfully, it seems like she's figured that out.", "YTA and a massive one.\n\nScars are part of our lives and hers show she fought and survived. There is nothing embarrassing in integrating scars or other body marks into cosplay.

And in case nobody told you before: cosplays aren't automatically meant to be \"attractive\".

I mean, how fucking disrespectful can you be? You\u2019re probably thinking, \u201chow am I being disrespectful?\u201d Well, for a few simple reasons, really. First, you\u2019re not entitled to a gf dressing in \u201csexy\u201d cosplay, or anything for that matter. She can cosplay however she chooses. Second, you didn\u2019t even tell her how cool of a cosplay that was? How much time and talent it takes to integrate SFX makeup into actual scars that come from one of the most vulnerable, debilitating times of her life - fucking CANCER?!?

I'm starting to feel guilty. \n\nBeing familiar with Dabi, YTA yes I think so.\n\nI absolutely agree with you that she was flaunting her scar--cosplay *is* flaunting. Your girlfriend has involuntarily had her gendered figure altered. That makes her options for flaunting herself very limited. I think you should recognized that and had it firmly in mind before you said ANYTHING.\n\nOn second thought.

This woman is so brave. She deserves much better than you.", "YTA. You should be happy that she's confident in her body to go in this cosplay to an event. \nWhy are you embarrassed?

Kudos to her to being to comfortable with herself after such a traumatic experience and surgery.", "YTA WHY should she hide her scars? She\u2019s a survivor and a fucking warrior and you\u2019re embarrassed? Ew. Shame on you.", "YTA and I knew it as soon as you said, \"Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery\" and confirmed it when you thought she was going to wear something sexy \"for me.\" Women are not there to dress sexy (or not) for men or anyone else. You were only embarrassed because you thought you would be able to show her off like some sort of trophy. \n\nGood for her for doing what *she* felt comfortable and confident doing, and it sounds like she rocked it. Using her real scars to complete the cosplay is not flaunting anything, it's just owning it and is honestly powerful to see.

I looked up the character you're talking about, and that part of the costume looks like it would be by far the hardest part to pull off. They are probably looking and taking notes on how to do it in future. \n\nI guarantee you, not one person besides **you** is looking at her mastectomy scars. She found a costume that made her feel good showing off that part of her body, something she probably has felt self-conscious about ever since the surgery. And you ruined that good feeling for her and turned it into something ugly. But I think the line that got me the most was \"I thought she was going to do something sexy for me\" and \"It wasn't a very attractive costume.\" You had to rain on her parade because it was something that wasn't **for you,** huh?

You weren\u2019t embarrassed by the costume/cosplay, you were embarrassed by the scars. You should be proud of her, proud of them being a symbol of her still being here and proud that she feels confident enough to have them on display. \n\nOther people looking is their problem, and you making her feeling any ounce of shame makes you a massive asshole.", "I have breast cancer. The fear I felt over the potential loss of my breasts was unlike anything. Worse, for me, than being infertile or losing my hair. I align with my gender, my breast were MINE. Sure, they fell into my armpits when I lay down\u2026 but they were MINE. And I was going to lose them.

You belittled her. You thought she looked unattractive. You took something that changes someone\u2019s life FOREVER in a way they will never have control over again and you SHAMED her for it.

This is so much more meaningful than sexiness. She showed you she was willing to play with her own identity and survivorship in an arena that is your thing. \n\nAnd you were disappointed. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re insensitive, it\u2019s that you are entirely clueless and shallow.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy (25M) GF (24) had a double mastectomy 5 years ago; she had breast cancer, and thankfully made a full recovery. Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery. This was before I met her. \n\nI'm a big anime nerd, and last weekend I invited her to a small anime con with me. She's seen a few episodes of my favorite shows, but she's not into anime; she does like cosplay, though, and she works seasonally as an SFX artist at a haunted house near us. So when I asked her to go to the con with me, she asked if she could cosplay, and I said sure. She got very excited and said I was going to love her costume, so I'll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me.\n\nWell, not exactly. The day of the convention comes, and she showed up at my house cosplaying Dabi from MHA- specifically a look he has later in the manga. It's a long white coat over white pants, no shirt. Her entire chest was exposed and she'd obviously spent hours applying burn makeup; she has short hair that she dyes constantly, this time she bleached it white and dyed a few red streaks. \n\nI wasn't expecting her to show up without a shirt. Her burn scar makeup only covered half her chest, so you could clearly see her mastectomy scar. It wasn't a verry attractive costume, especially since she'd gone all out with the scars and made them look raised and kind of realistic. \n\nWe went to the con, and while a lot of people came up to take photos with her, I noticed several others looking at her chest. That evening, she said I'd been quiet all day, and I honestly told her I was a little embarrassed that she was flaunting her mastectomy scar like that.
