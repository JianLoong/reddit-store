I met up with a few friends there, including a girl I'm going to call Katy (23f).\n\nKaty is the youngest in our friendship circle and while she's lovely, she hasn't quite got to grips with alcohol yet and frankly she embarrasses herself a lot. We think she might do it to try to keep up with us, which we never pressure her to do. \n\nAt this night out, Katy was drinking heavily to, as she put it, give her Dutch courage. I was so irritated that she would want to do that, because she knows her tolerance is low. She's well aware that she can't handle drink, but she still does it and always suffers the consequences and burdens other people. She basically kept drinking and drinking until she had drank 11 pints of strong alcohol. I found her collapsed in the bathroom, unable to even move, let alone speak. By this time all my friends had already gone home, so I was stuck with her.\n\nMyself and some bar staff helped her outside, where she threw up. She sat on the pavement for a while with me as I tried to get her sobered up. I hadn't brought my car with me, and I was planning on getting a cab home. No cabs would take her of course, as they were afraid she'd vomit in their cars. By this point hours had passed and she wasn't getting better. It was the early hours and I was shivering with cold so decided to get myself a cab home, but that would mean leaving Katy with nobody.\n\nI felt really bad, but I knew I would make myself unwell if I stayed out all night. Besides that, I felt strongly that I had been put in a position of care that I did not ask for,  and I hadn't forced Katy, an adult, to drink so much that she clearly couldn't handle. I didnt feel like it was my problem to solve honestly. I picked her up and very carefully helped her towards the entrance to an underground station nearby. They have great staff in there with first aid and the ambulance on speed dial, who would be more than capable of helping her. They also deal with drunk people all the time and aren't unfamiliar with procedures to look after them.\n\nI called a cab and went home. Next day I was absolutely inundated by texts from friends saying I shouldn't have left Katy alone and id put her in danger. However I also heard from people who said it hadn't been my fault whatsoever and I did what was best for myself in a tough situation that I did not cause.

Why did you not call an ambulance and emergency services? It clearly seems like she needed that kind of intervention.

Can\u2019t believe anyone would leave a person who couldn\u2019t defend themselves on the side of the fuckin\u2019 road. If you knew she was prone to this behavior but still invited her you should have had a backup plan. Or fuck, even had tried to call someone else to help. But leaving her there was no better than leaving her to be robbed, attacked, raped, or killed. \n\nI hope that was a sobering experience for ALL of you, and that she finds better friends.", "?? Obviously YTA\u2026 you guys couldn\u2019t figure it out before EVERYONE left? So you left her in a subway thrashed? Or maybe you guys can tell her to relax and stop drinking so much? Have some situational awareness ffs", "I don\u2019t think I need to read the rest after seeing the title. Never leave a vulnerable friend behind. YTA", "Frankly, Katy sounds like a vulnerable young woman amidst a \"friendship circle\" of older adults and she's trying to fit in by drinking herself into oblivion.\n\nThis is hugely problematic. Not least your heartless response. *How could you leave her*. \n\nyta", "YTA.   \nIf you think she needed an ambulance ring it yourself. Don\u2019t dump her in a subway for who knows who to do who knows what to her\u2026 \n\nSit down and have a talk to Katy.

Don't leave a drunk friend alone in the middle of the night in public, let alone a girl. Yea she fucked up by drinking a lot but nothing compared to your fuckup, though I have a feeling she won't be friends with you anyway.", "YTA Look, the girl was out of line for getting that drunk but you never should have left her. You could have called friends to pick you up or called a cab company and told them the situation, asking what they recommend/do in these situations. \n\nYou never should have left her.", "YTA and why even bother calling her your friend. I\u2019ve been kinder to passed out drunk perfect strangers.", "Uhhh YTA. You went wrong in multiple places here. You\u2019re aware of her habit of getting way too drunk and you dislike it yet you went out with her anyway? You enabled her and put yourself in a position you\u2019re not comfortable with. I get it\u2019s annoying and technically yeah she\u2019s not your responsibility as she\u2019s an adult. Sure a taxi wouldn\u2019t take her but there were multiple other options that didn\u2019t include leaving her at a station. You yourself say the employees are used to drunks so you really thought \u201csure my young, vulnerable, female friend will be safe here.\u201d That\u2019s fucked. If a cab won\u2019t take her, use her phone and call her friends. Call an Uber. Walk her somewhere safe and ask for help. You mention the station could call an ambulance. So part of you thought she might need medical attention yet\u2026 you didn\u2019t call an ambulance yourself? \nSure it\u2019s an inconvenience but a few phone calls or walking a few blocks in the cold is a better option than putting your friend in a position where she\u2019s vulnerable to all sorts of things. Besides all the worst nightmares (kidnap, rape, murder) she could simply fall and hit her head or die of alcohol poisoning. You had the time to \u201csit for hours\u201d but not the time to find a safe solution for your \u201cfriend?\u201d \nThe key thing to me here is you claim she\u2019s a friend. No real friend would do that. If it were a stranger I\u2019d say helping would be nice but not your problem. You all came there together insinuating you will not only be responsible for yourselves but each other as FRIENDS. Yeah she needs to grow up and get shit under control but you say that like you\u2019re more responsible than her when clearly you\u2019re not. She probably thought she was safe with her friends and woke up drunk and alone in an underground. That sucks. I hope both of you grow up and learn from this. Hopefully she starts drinking responsibly and finds new friends. Also, depending on when your friends left they\u2019re also AH. If they knew how drunk she was and just left you alone to deal with it that\u2019s not fair and sucks dicks and you got the short end of the stick but you should have sucked it up for the safety of your friend.", "Wow first off stop calling her your friend because you most certainly are not a friend. YTA", "The thing is, Katy can be dumb and wrong for drinking that much and still YTA. She shouldn\u2019t have done that. You can be right about that.\n\nBut once she does, she could be kidnapped or raped or anything. If you don\u2019t make sure she gets somewhere safely YTA. It sucks, it\u2019s shitty to take care of someone who didn\u2019t take care of themselves, I get that. But that doesn\u2019t mean you leave them in danger.", "WOW you've reached a new level of YTA\n\nShe could have DIED from poisoning. \nShe could have been RAPED.\nShe could have been MURDERED.\n\nDid none of these scenarios cross your selfish little mind? I hope she ditches this \"friend\" group cuz you guys suck.", "YTA - You absolutely can\u2019t ever leave a drunk friend in public when she can\u2019t take care of herself. If something happened to her it would be partly your fault. I know the situation sounds like a huge pain in the ass, but you made a bad choice and are not a good friend", "YTA. Why are you constantly defending what you did? You couldn\u2019t have gotten her home safely? WTF.", "YTA. Sure - Katy shouldn\u2019t have drank so much, but abandoning an incapacitated person - especially a female AND in a fucking subway station - is just inhumane. And **extremely** dangerous.\n\nI\u2019m sure if you saw someone having a seizure or heart attack or bad car accident, you\u2019d just think \u201cew, I don\u2019t want to deal with that crap.\u201d\n\nYou need to take a good, hard look in the mirror if you think your actions are acceptable in any way, shape, or form. Is this really the kind of person you want to be? Really? Your mom should be ashamed of the child she rose.", "Very much YTA ! \nRule #1 you neverrrr leave a friend alone when they are intoxicated. She couldn\u2019t speak or even move and you decide to leave her with total strangers?? You could have handled this very differently and could have called friends, family whoever else since cabs weren\u2019t taking her. You could have spoken to her the next day and let her know how she can\u2019t handle her liquor and you will not be taking care of her each time she decides to get wasted because you are not a babysitter and she is a grown adult. But yes, you are the asshole and a bad friend for leaving her.", "YTA absolutely. You could have called one of her family members, a roommate if she had one, taken public transit with her to get her home, offered to pay a cleaning deposit a cab in case she does throw up. Go to a coffee shop or late night fast food place until she sobers up. Heck you could have even checked into a hotel/motel/hostel for the night with her and then have her pay you back.   \n\n\nOne of the above solutions would have worked, but the one thing you never do is abandon a friend who has drank too much.", "YTA. You abandoned your friend when she was too drunk to take care of herself. You are still TA for all of your excuses. You would not be to stop going out with her, or by leaving earlier in the evening before she got drunk or before your other friends left.", "You are all shitty people, in general! You suck, your friends suck, and the alcoholic needs to get her shit together!", "YTA. You left an incapacitated woman, whom you supposedly consider to be a friend alone outside in the cold.\n\nI get that you didn't ask for this, but you should have taken care of your friend this time, and just refused to go out with her anymore.\n\nEdited to add that although your other friends had already left, you could have called them to see if anyone would be willing to come back and take you both home.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who once had to take a drunk friend home with them, because she passed out before she could finish directing me to her home. I couldn't get her to wake up, and really wanted to get in bed. Yes, we were already in my car, but I did not just leave her out on the street to find her own way home in the middle of the night.", "Feeling cute.  I think I\u2019ll leave my passed out friend out on the street. \n\nYes, YTA for obvious reasons.", "I was roofied when I was about her age and apparently in the same condition as her. Luckily nothing happened to me because my friends weren\u2019t awful like you and your friends. They took me to the emergency room because I needed help, that\u2019s what you should have done instead of abandoning her.\n\nYTA.", "YTA ! How exactly would you have felt to have seen a news story the next day about a young girl murdered in the subway/station. Your behaviour was disgusting, you went home because you starting getting chilly. Give me a break.", "Yta - I\u2019m no lawyer but you\u2019re lucky nothing happened to her otherwise you\u2019d be very lucky not to see a jail cell.\n\nIn the USA, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a  Reckless Heart could\u2019ve been made an/or  if you had any form of EMR training then you\u2019d be criminal negligence.", "YTA\nWhat made you think that leaving someone who was unable to fend for themselves was okay? Young women disappear because predators know that they are unable to protect themselves, and that could have happened to your friend. You suck. Karma can be a bitch. Just remember that.", "YTA\n\nAnd don't call her your friend. A friend would not leave someone so severely intoxicated alone. You should have at least called her an ambulance if you thought she was anywhere nearly drunk enough to warrant it", "> I did what was best for myself\n\nExactly. And that makes you a huuuuuuge asshole.", "YTA \n\nA lightweight couldn't drink eleven pints. How do you even know exactly what she had? \nAt 27, you should know better than to leave a woman in that state alone. Shame on you.", "YTA. If you\u2019re with a \u201cfriend\u201d who drank 11 pints of alcohol and you want to abandon her, at least drop her off at the hospital.", "ESH\n\nKaty for drinking too much when she knows she can't hold it, your other friends for all leaving you with the responsibility of Katy, and you for not calling 911/999 when you realized she wasn't getting better.", "I feel like there were measures you could have taken other than the one you did. \n\nCall one of your friends?? HER family?? This would have actually given you a very good opening to addressing this problem with the friend group since you\u2019d be the \u201chero\u201d. Maybe they even would have talked to her to KNOW HER LIMITS.\n\nShe is gullible yes. But she didn\u2019t deserve to be left in a subway with strangers. \n\nYTA. Also your friends. Who did not pace her from drinking (she is much younger than you guys) and they did not make sure she was safe before leaving.", "ESH. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have left Katy by herself.

If you are too drunk to speak, you need medical help.", "Yta. She needs to stop drinking like this, but she could have died, she could have been assaulted, or could have been abducted. You put her near a fucking underground station? You should have called an ambulance if she wasn't functional. You could have also taken her home with you, called another friend with a car, or called someone in her family. Leaving her passed out and alone is beyond assholish. Its criminal!", "YTA and a terrible \u201cfriend\u201d. You NEVER leave a friend behind, especially one who is blackout drunk and extremely vulnerable. I\u2019m so glad you managed to avoid getting a cold by leaving a woman on her own and incapacitated in the early hours.

Going out with her sounds tedious and you wnbta to have a hard conversation with her after the event or refuse to go drinking with her again, but most people I know wouldn\u2019t abandon a stranger they found in that vulnerable a position, let alone a \u2018friend\u2019. \nA friend of mine was acting very irrationally after being roofied and leaving the people she was out with, but was saved from anything bad happening by a group of strangers who had been trying to have a fun night out basically giving that up to follow her around and keep her out of trouble until they managed to help her get in contact with her boyfriend and then staying with her until he arrived to look after her. That is what human beings do for other vulnerable humans, regardless of how self inflicted the problem is or how annoying and inconvenient it might be.", "ESH. Katy is 23.

I don't see why OP needs to go out of her way to help the girl if she barely knows her.\n\nOP wasn't the designated driver or the one in charge of babysitting the girl.

The evening was not a surprise, it was planned, Katy had ample time to sort out things.\n\nIf you were close friends with Katy, you should have dropped her home and had a talk with her the next day, as that's responsible drinking.\n\nIf you aren't that close, she's not your responsibility.", "ESH\n\nYou ( and your friends) shouldn't have left her. Why not just call an ambulance and foot her with the bill, she'll be safe and it will be her issue afterwards to handle it.\n\nBut let's not forget Katie's part in this, she is hardly an innocent victim. Yes you should not have left her but come on, she shouldn't have drunk that much, that's her own responsibility and she is an adult.

You are 27 you have no legal obligation to care for an adult who is in a vulnerable state through her own choices BUT she was left at the end of the evening with you as the last of her friend group - sure you are not responsible for her choices but to leave her at an underground station in the hope that medical intervention may be available is abandoning her at the kerb. You have had enough- I get that, but the choices were to call an ambulance yourself and wait until you knew she was safe, call a known contact for her and hand over responsibility when they arrived or at the barest minimum ensure she is left with an official person at the club/underground station where a medical assessment  be undertaken and her safety is ensured before dumping her.  Genuinely thought this was a troll post as I cannot get my head round the lack of care for a friend\u2019 even if they put themself in that position. They were still vulnerable and human connection alone should make you choose another\u2019s safety over your comfort.

Onpy one here that can be blamed for what happened is Katy.\n\nEdit: Damn, lots of people in here claiming that drunks have no personal responsibility.  Years back my friend disappeared from the bar after drinking too much. Didn't answer his phone, so we couldn't find him.  We just went home, because he was an adult who can look after himself.  He told us the next day that he woke up under a food cart with one shoe and had to ride the bus home like that.

However, it doesn't fully excuse your actions. \n\nYou seemed potentially put together enough to have made better choices, seeing as you a) sat with her for several hours leading you time to sober up a bit, but more importantly B) recognized she was severely unwell and C) took her to pawn off on other non medical/emergency personnel forcing them to be caretakers just as you felt you'd been forced to become. \n\nLook, I lack some empathy when heavily drinking (mostly, i can't take care of sad drunks/touchy-feely drunks because i get very anti-touchy-feely myself, and I can't take care of someone actively getting sick because im a sympathetic vomiter and become useless myself) and I can not handle other drunk people as a reluable caregiver. I make this clear to everyone I go out drinking with that if it's more than a few drinks, I can not promise to be responsible for them depending on how they behave when intoxicated.

I have found assistance for friends who are vomiting their guts out and stayed near to make sure they're safe but that I'm far enough away to mitigate the sympathetic vomiting issue I have. I've stopped going for drinks with people who can't control themselves because I don't want to be in a position where I can't handle them all alone. I have never abandoned someone no matter how trashed I was as well. You need to take responsibility for that and look inside to determine how to rectify this aspect of yourself. The answer may be not to go out with her anymore or to make sure you leave earlier so you and her aren't the last ones there  \n\nBased on mentions of the NHS, I take it you're in the UK somewhere. In this case, calling an ambulance wasn't going to risk bankrupting your friend, and while I understand there are strikes occurring, it seems you were aware she was significantly unwell, yet chose to allow someone else to potentially make that call rather than make it yourself.
