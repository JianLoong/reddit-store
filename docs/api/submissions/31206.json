Recipes where the alcohol is added at the end, like brandy caramel sauce, cherries jubilee, and beer cheese, can retain 85% of their alcohol.  If you keep a large pot of assorted things at the boiling point if alcohol, it can take up to 2 hours to cook off 95%, and you really can\u2019t get the last 5% out because the water and a small amount of alcohol bind to each other, meaning you have to dry out everything in the pot to get out the last bit of alcohol.\n\nNow, a properly made penne ala vodka, you start with just the vodka and aromatics in the pan and cook off the majority of the alcohol before you add anything that slows down the alcohol cooking out, so the alcohol in this recipe should all be gone, but you can\u2019t say as much for all recipes that use alcohol.", "Ok but are the kids drinking a gallon of pasta sauce?
