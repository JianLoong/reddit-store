NTA", "NTA\n\nPlaying devil's advocate and assuming you screwed up the recipe completely, adding the alcohol at the end and failing to cook it off, how much is actually in the dish? A few measures shared between 6+ people, absorbed into a heavy pasta dish - if you wanted to get people drunk, that is not the way to go about it (even kids).\n\nMore realistically, the alcohol should have cooked off anyway, and is acting as nothing more than a flavouring. The adults can still happily drive safely and legally, the kids remain sober, and everyone is happy. There is a massive difference between drinking spirits and using alcohol as a component of a dish - red wine is another regular ingredient in Italian cooking, or things like using beer as an ingredient in batters or making whiskey sauces for meat are all pretty normal and child friendly.", "NTA please send her the recipe and some information on the science behind why it isn't an issue.  Next time she might embarrass herself in public.  If it was only her I wouldn't worry, but it's the second hand embarrassment for the kids I want to avoid.  It's not their fault their mum doesn't have a clue.", "MTA I love vodka sauce and all of it is cooked off anyway and you don\u2019t taste it.

Your sister is delusional.", "OMG, there's like one or two tablespoons of vodka - divided by however much the sauce gets divided, that's more alcohol in many mouthwashes or cough medicines.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Does she also freak out when wine or brandy is in a sauce.  Crazy.", "Cider vinegar white wine sauce list goes on lol also nta", "I put the vodka in at the beginning and it was a small amount. I would be surprised if there was any alcohol in the sauce.", "Who adds alcohol at the end?  Lol good lord", "Putting alcohol in foods is nuts", "That very much depends on the recipe.  Alcohol most assuredly does not always just cook off.  For example, baked goods, which often cook a good deal longer than penne ala vodka, retain about half the alcohol they started with due to the crust on top.  Recipes where the alcohol is added at the end, like brandy caramel sauce, cherries jubilee, and beer cheese, can retain 85% of their alcohol.  If you keep a large pot of assorted things at the boiling point if alcohol, it can take up to 2 hours to cook off 95%, and you really can\u2019t get the last 5% out because the water and a small amount of alcohol bind to each other, meaning you have to dry out everything in the pot to get out the last bit of alcohol.\n\nNow, a properly made penne ala vodka, you start with just the vodka and aromatics in the pan and cook off the majority of the alcohol before you add anything that slows down the alcohol cooking out, so the alcohol in this recipe should all be gone, but you can\u2019t say as much for all recipes that use alcohol.", "Ok but are the kids drinking a gallon of pasta sauce? There\u2019s so little vodka compared to the rest of the sauce ingredients!", "Yeah, when it\u2019s done right, you end up around 1-2% ABV, which is about where yeast-risen breads and yogurt tip the scales.  So there\u2019s a tiny bit left, but it\u2019s the same kind of tiny bit that is in foods your sister probably feeds her kid without a second thought.\n\nNow, alcohol in baked goods and things like brandy caramel where it\u2019s added at the end can be much higher.  The crust on baked goods prevents alcohol escaping, as does being added to other liquids with little time to cook off.  Those can have up to 85% of the alcohol they started with.  But when you cook off the alcohol at the beginning, you can get rid of almost all of it.", "There\u2019s an idiot in every group.", "It's a seasoning.", "I make a holiday fruitcake that should NOT be consumed by children. Pasta sauce, risotto, etc.? I wouldn\u2019t even think about it.", "Orange Juice can have an ABV\u2026", "My granny swears that she, her siblings and her cousins used to get tipsy off of her grandmother\u2019s Christmas pudding because she used to add so much booze to it.", "Any fruit juice can, really.  Which makes sense, if you think about - all those sugars just love fermenting."]}
