I still feel awful, even as an adult I don't really do parties so I just don't have much social awareness over unwritten rules like that, but my point is as long as you're not literally wearing a white gown and clearly trying deliberately to overshadow the bride, I just don't see how it's a serious enough offense for anyone to physically assault you with wine...", "NTA.

If you value your relationship with the couple / with the groom, be the bigger person and reach out, apologize, let them know you meant no harm, and ask to catch up soon.  If you have good reason to believe that the bride encouraged her friend to pour wine on you, though, you might also consider just letting this go and the friendship fade - to me, that response is petty, immature and dramatic.\n\nEdited for clarity", "NTA I was ready to say y t a but that dress is striped and looks nothing like a wedding dress.

Wedding culture is weird because the couple can be incredibly selfish, entilted, and demanding and people are expected to just go along with it. I will  never understand it.", "I wore gold, but if someone had shown up on a white wedding dress and a tulle VEIL and another guest had poured wine on them, I wouldn\u2019t care if it was my best friend; it\u2019d be the wine-pourer who got kicked out. If I wanted a white dress incident dealt with, I\u2019d deal with it privately and quietly (although frankly, I wouldn\u2019t have cared.)", "It\u2019s a faux pas to wear a white dress. But wearing some white in an outfit with other colors is fine.", "And this wasn\u2019t a wedding.", "It wasn't a wedding.", "It wasn\u2019t a wedding. It was a reception for people who couldn\u2019t attend the destination wedding. That dress is perfectly fine for a casual party, which is what the OP said the invitations stated.", "It wasn\u2019t the wedding. It was a reception for people who couldn\u2019t make the wedding and it was casual dress. The dress looks casual and is definitely not white.", "If you view them both as assholes then a better classification\u2019s probably ESH, no? And I was prepared to say ESH until I saw the actual dress\u2026 it\u2019s barely white tbh", "Except she didn\u2019t wear white", "The dress wasn't white.\n\nNTA. \n\nThe OP is using \"white\" in quotations, because that is what the argument is about irl.  It is NOT white, and is a super casual dress.", "Did you see the picture?  It is beige and white stripes and in no way competed with wedding attire. \n\nOP is NTA!", "It\u2019s not white", "It's not white and it wasn't a wedding.", "> \"oops. I'm sorry I spilled wine all over your white dress at the wedding celebration. I tripped and it was an accident.\"\n\nYou know who apologizes this way? People who definitely meant to do what they did.", "Do you really think the spill was accidental???", "There were guys wearing white t-shirts. I know sure, \u201cthey\u2019re guys so it\u2019s not the same,\u201d but it kinda is the same. OP is NTA", "it's not from an AITA post lol \"maid of honor spilling red wine on white dresses\" is a running joke culturally, the joke has been made in every wedding party I've ever been in, it's bigger than a reddit post", "I would say the times you don't wear white would be engagement party, rehearsal dinner, actual wedding and if there is a second party/ celebration of the wedding for people who couldn't attend. So, yes this would be a time white shouldn't be worn, but that dress doesn't fall into the category of white dress.", "If the bride and groom are in their wedding attire, then yes, it\u2019s fair that white is banned. This dress was clearly not white, and even if it were white, that does not excuse assaulting OP. NTA.", "But that's why I don't get the big deal! If it was my wedding and you were acting all mortified about it I'd be so confused. Like your white dress and navy blazer is going to \"steal my spotlight\"???? People honestly act like wearing white is the equivalent of storming up the aisle and elbowing the bride out of the way in the middle of her vows.", "Yes, I think so, too.", "And the dress wasn\u2019t white.", "If it\u2019s anything relating to a wedding, you don\u2019t wear white. Or \u2018cream\u2019 as people are saying this was. It\u2019s not that hard.", "And it also wasn't a wedding.", "Not JUST white and I didn\u2019t say they should have drowned her in wine. But I refuse to believe she doesn\u2019t have another dress to wear. And it was essentially a wedding reception.", "Or a drunkard mistaking that picnic dress for a white wedding dress LMAO.", ">During the party, the married couple wore their wedding outfits again.\n\n\nProlly. No way would anyone think she was competing with the bride.", "There was literally an AITA post about it. The mother was super toxic and wanted the wedding to be about her instead of the bride and groom. But it wasn\u2019t the maid of honor that spilled the wine, it was the groom\u2019s sister & the MOH texted her about it saying thank you. The exact thing the person you replied to was talking about a Reddit post. Try again.", "Unless the invitations explicitly state that white is banned or the grooms will be wearing their wedding attires...", "Lol, thank you.  I still feel embarrassed when I remember that wedding but your understanding makes me feel better.", "They were saying the concept of spilling wine on an inappropriately dressed person certainly did not originate with AITA or reddit - that has been a thing since before the internet was invented. Try going outside then try again.", "Lmao, no one puts on an invitation that white is banned at a wedding celebration"]}
