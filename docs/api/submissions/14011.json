I still feel awful, even as an adult I don't really do parties so I just don't have much social awareness over unwritten rules like that, but my point is as long as you're not literally wearing a white gown and clearly trying deliberately to overshadow the bride, I just don't see how it's a serious enough offense for anyone to physically assault you with wine...", "NTA.

If you value your relationship with the couple / with the groom, be the bigger person and reach out, apologize, let them know you meant no harm, and ask to catch up soon.  If you have good reason to believe that the bride encouraged her friend to pour wine on you, though, you might also consider just letting this go and the friendship fade - to me, that response is petty, immature and dramatic.\n\nEdited for clarity", "NTA I was ready to say y t a but that dress is striped and looks nothing like a wedding dress.

Unless the guest in white is wearing a veil and/or holding a bouquet too, it\u2019s no big deal. We had a more casual wedding celebration so I chose a more informal white dress (strapless, but less tulle/puff etc). A friend of mine showed up in a cream strapless that could\u2019ve also passed for a wedding dress in hindsight, but you know, I didn\u2019t even realize it until we saw our wedding photos.

You did well not to make a bigger scene, I think I would\u2019ve.", "NTA\n\nThe dress you wore is nothing even remotely like a wedding dress, nor can it even be classified as \"white\".\n\nIt also wasn't a fucking wedding ceremony.\n\nYou should speak to your friend because they clearly have some issue with you personally imo. No one would do that to someone that they actually considered a friend.", "NTA but it sounds like you\u2019re owed a new dress by a bride who wants to relive the attention she got on her wedding day and her best friend who didn\u2019t get to be as much of an AH as she wanted to be during her reign as (I assume) maid of honor. \n\nIf I were you? Pick a white flowery gown, send them a picture and say \u201csince I know you\u2019ll be wanting to replace the dress, this one will do\u201d", "For a second when you said \"white\" I actually thought YTA but that dress is not even white its more like a cream/yellow-ish color so YNTA", "NTA, this is a very sporty and not white dress. I think people have gone too far with the \"ban all white-ish clothes\" rule and at this point everyone is just looking to spot the person who comes in white instead of enjoying the event. This one is definitelly not a white/wedding dress, so they shouldn't have caused drama for no reason.", "YTA, you don\u2019t wear white or anything beige/white to a western wedding. You don\u2019t need to be told that you can\u2019t wear white/beige to a wedding.", "It's obviously blue and gold.", "It wasn't a wedding.", "mf got this off google", "Another example of the above. I was young (about 20) and it was the first wedding i was invited to so didn\u2019t know about faux pas. It was also the only appropriate looking dress i owned. It was white but could not be mistaken for the bride (was just a simple dress, think more like sleeveless work shift dress!). No one cared or said anything, probably because some people turned up in tshirts and jeans lol", "Did you bother to even LOOK at the photo?", "This wasn't a wedding. The wedding already occurred. Dress code was casual", "This wasn't a wedding", "please don\u2019t do this \ud83d\ude2d", "Anyone remember the pink vs mint green sneakers?", "Now you\u2019ve gone and done it! I thought we were past this \ud83d\ude24", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I was hoping someone would say this", "Right, I was thinking the same thing. The court of public shaming can be more effective nowadays though. I would absolutely put this about in the social media of the friend group. The girl should be shamed into apologizing for her behavior, it\u2019s ridiculous. Pretty soon, brides are going to pass out potato sacks for women to change into before they\u2019re allowed to enter.", "It\u2019s bigger than that.  It is considered a prime MILimination tactic/tactic to deal with an attention grabber at someone\u2019s wedding event.  People who actually do it are referred to as members of \u201cThe Order of Saint R______\u201d (I am blanking on the specific name), and it is discussed on many forums dealing with toxic family members on multiple multiple sites.\n\nThe dress pictured does not fall under the guidelines for a red wine incident (which is specifically for -white- dresses that look like or actually are wedding dresses worn to wedding receptions by people who mean to take the spotlight from the bride).  There is no way that a pretty dress with white horizontal stripes falls under that umbrella.\n\nETA I\u2019d get the woman\u2019s name and look into whether or not it would be worth pursuing a small claims case and/or assault charges because she was way out of line.", "Haha my MIL wore a \u201cchampagne\u201d colored dress to my wedding. Sigh", "There needs to be some logic applied here. Could the dress be at all mistaken for a wedding dress? Is attention being taken away from the bride? No? Move on.", "It couldn't even be mistaken for a respectable outfit unless that outfit was a nightgown.  Weird.", "Going NC is probably the mature option but boy I\u2019d like to see that crazy person get some consequences", "That color scheme sounds STUNNING.", "It blows my mind that people spend months and tens of thousands of dollars putting on this very unoriginal show for a few dozens/hundred friends and family when they get married. Imho, a wedding has nothing to do with anyone else and it\u2019s kind of weird to even think that people besides your parents care to witness the ceremony itself.", "I've never met them.", "Nah that can't be. The world is entirely AITA.", "Totally agree that it depends on the bride, but in this case, OP doesn\u2019t know the bride", "Yeah, I\u2019m really side eying all this strict \u201cguests\u2019 dresses at weddings can\u2019t have even a white background!\u201d attitudes. None of the brides I\u2019ve known have been so paranoid about it. A long, fancy white dress? Definite no no. But a nice dress that has any shade of white in it? Perfectly fine. I\u2019d even say that a purely white or off white nice, non-floor length dress is still fine. There\u2019s still a big difference between that and a wedding dress (unless it\u2019s a super casual wedding maybe). The dress here? Obviously not a wedding dress. The bridesmaid (and bride if she\u2019d said something about it) is ridiculous.", "\"We\" aren't doing anything, except pointing out existing social mores.\n\nIt is mostly the bride who gets offended if someone else wears white to their wedding, so the only people policing the behavior are brides or bridesmaids.", "Am I personally policing it? No, I personally did not care what anyone wore to my wedding. Is it a general rule of thumb to avoid white and shades of white \u2026 yes, yes it is.", "In my 50 years I\u2019ve never worn white to a wedding or known it to be acceptable in Australia unless you\u2019re the bride. I\u2019m going to a wedding in a few weeks and it specifies no white except men\u2019s shirts or equivalent.", "Great minds", "HAHAHAAHAH. We have similar MILs then!", "Unfortunately, sometimes brides don\u2019t operate on \u2018logic.\u2019 That\u2019s why the general approach is to avoid white and shades of white. I personally did not care what anyone wore to my wedding, but I am very aware of the general rule when buying a dress for a wedding because it\u2019s the safest approach.", "Like if this was like white with beige lace or something fancier I could understand the bff she\u2019d still be wrong but I could see where she was coming from. But if the bride was wearing her wedding dress there is no way this dress could be mistaken for a wedding dress.", "This. At my wedding, the only dress my mother loved for her outfit was a dark cream/very light beige. I wore eggshell. Her dress was definitely formal- Intricate bodice details, long, etc. She tried on dozens of dresses for MONTHS and that was the single dress she compared all the others to. The only other colors that dress came in had sold out in any size she could have fit into/tailored to fit. I still had to insist she buy the damn dress, she was mortified at the idea of others thinking the dress was too flashy or bridal. Pictures came back, and you guessed it- she looked lovely and *I still was clearly the bride*. Other folks wore pastels *and I barely noticed*. They all looked lovely in person and the photos, and unless they had tried to butt into the ceremony I barely had time to notice even the few slightly outlandish outfits present.", "I cannot get behind the \"don't wear the same color as the bridesmaids either!\" FFS, how many wedding rules are people going to impose on innocent bystanders?", "I have worn a white dress covered in purple flowers and musical notes with the brides approval (and still felt weird but my initial dress ripped and it was a dress I had packed for another event). But the last wedding I attended I had two dress options (pregnant so limited) and o showed the groom who was hubby's best mate, he said, hang on that one might be too close to the bridesmaid (maroon was my dress, burnt orange was bridesmaids), he got the bride to text to confirm and I threw the dress into the nope pile. Ended up talking to the bride later and she pulled out a navy dress I had noped for being to formal and she said, \"hey prego, wear what's comfortable plus no one will see your shoes in this so you can where crappy old joggers if that's what's comfortable (she knows me well when it comes to matching shoes to outfits). \n\nThis story though. NTA, that dress isn't white and no one would mistake OP for the bride in it. Bridesmaid (and possibly bride) were just being petty AHs.", "Fate had to save me once, even after I followed your protip \ud83e\udd23. \nI had picked a cute blue dress off RentTheRunway for a formal wedding. The bridesmaids were in shades of blue, but this was slate blue, almost gray. I was convinced it would be fine. Well, it didn't end up fitting, I ran out of time and had to wear something else that was nowhere near as cute. Show up to the wedding- the Maid of Honor was wearing the slate blue dress. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Yeah, I don't think she is the AH here, but it seems weird that she feels the need to specify that \"the invitation didn't say not to wear white\". Yeah, it didn't say that because it isn't something that should need said in an invitation to the celebration of a wedding.\n\nNow, this dress isn't white and pouring wine on OP is overreacting, but I would have gone with a different color dress if I had been her.", "My wedding dress was Black.", "I once went to a wedding where the bridesmaids wore black. Try to not match them then \ud83e\udee0", "In general, I'd just avoid weddings. People get crazy anxious about them in advance and then use any stupid rule as an excuse to abuse people they barely know at them.", "i mean, how would you even know ahead of time???", "Good friends wedding last year and one of her cousins wore a dress that looked VERY much like the brides maids dresses, it wasn't just the colour, it was the style as well. You could easily think she was a bridesmaid. But also no one cared.", "My sister\u2019s was as well! She included in the dress code for direct family to wear something cream or mustard. I\u2019m not sure if there was a dress code for non reatives. I don\u2019t remember anyone besides her or the groom wearing black though so I assume they said not to. Her dress was long and lacy and very bridal in my opinion. So again it all depends on what the bride thinks of as bridal. To me it\u2019s less about the color and more about a dress style", "They didn\u2019t end up covered in wine though ?", "Yeah our friends are getting married in a much more expensive city than they\u2019re originally from and their extended family won\u2019t make it for various health, financial and scheduling reasons, so they had a big engagement party/shower more akin to a reception at home a few months before. It\u2019s great bc their wedding is gonna be pretty small, and now their parents can go nuts inviting their family friends and old neighbors who used to babysit and coworkers and 4th cousins or whoever you don\u2019t really want to invite but your parents think you should!", "Help I thought we weren\u2019t supposed to wear black for weddings lolol which way is up?", "My best friend's wedding dress was black and she said no little black dresses allowed lol.", "Generally south Asians wear red as the bride but not always. But all guests dress up full glam to south Asian weddings wearing whatever colour they want inc red/gold. (I\u2019ve seen people wear their own wedding dress to another persons wedding) Your still not able to outshine the bride.", "Technically you\u2019re not but a majority of cocktail attire is comprised of black fabric."]}
