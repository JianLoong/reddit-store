Plus education is affordable, and many UK and Australian universities have campuses here.", "Depends, lots of cities especially have plenty of Muslims. There's even a mosque in a small town in Alberta due to early Lebanese imigration.\n\nIt's the fastest growing religion in Canada, unless you consider irreligion.", "Such a negative comment replied to with a such a diametrically opposed \"Happy Cake Day!\"\n\nI love it. Lmao", "r/unexpectedhappycakeday", "This is an improvement, yes, but loads of employers still won\u2019t accept it, and they tell students \u201cwe can\u2019t take you on now because we won\u2019t sponsor you in 2 years.\u201d It\u2019s unethical, short-sighted and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s great on the discrimination side of things and yet, here we are. \n\nSource: I\u2019m a careers adviser at a university with lots of brilliant international students.\n\nSo yeah, this guy has massively screwed over his kids.", "It's not racism. Many western countries have travel bans...for a reason. There are many human rights violations - many of which directed at women and honour killings etc still occur fairly frequently.", "real, they are just projecting their racist assumptions of pakistani men onto this one person", "Yeah this comment section is making me very uncomfortable.", "And how is it better that both parents decided that their kids didn\u2019t deserve to have *options*? That\u2019s the bare minimum of decent parenthood. *especially* for a woman. Talk about racism all you want, but life for women in certain countries is definitely less than ideal and that poor girl grew up in the UK only to be forced to go back to a place where she has way less rights.", "Yeah this comment section is making me very uncomfortable.", "Worse now? Or better? Suppose it depends on values and specifically your views on women's rights. OP probably views the shifts as a great outcome", "His reasoning for leaving is that he has to marry them off virgin and the eldest is going to uni soon, so he cannot control her closely any more. In facts he suggests she could go to Malaysia, which is notoriously a strict country.", "And where he feels respected. Taking his post at face value, I think he didn\u2019t think it all through, and had a knee jerk reaction/fit of pique.", "Actually we are neither secular nor a Muslim country. We have freedom of religion here, but Islam is the dominant religion due to the larger population of Malays who practice Islam. Most cultures here value some measure of modesty, especially by the older generations. \n\nOtherwise we\u2019re kinda chill and it\u2019s pretty modern overall as a developing nation.", "Everyone assuming OP is sexist, fundamentalist, and ignoring his wife's opinion just because he's Pakistani is racist. \n\nI'm fully aware of the country 's human rights record, but I don't assume I know OP and his personality because of it.", "His offering of Malaysia isn't what you think. Malaysia has amazing universities and it costs much less for international students than the UK, US, and Australia. It's very popular for many students coming from third world countries because of that."]}
