When I started going there 2 years ago, I was skinny as fuck and had absolutely no idea what I was doing, and the people there weren\u2019t judgmental and were always willing to offer me advice and help out. So I expected my sister to have a similar experience. \n\nTo my surprise, she came back from her first time there and said it was horrible and people bullied her. I asked her what happened, and she wasn\u2019t able to say anything concrete other than that people stared at her \u2018in a mean way\u2019 and gave off unfriendly vibes.\n\nThis was surprising to me, and while I didn\u2019t want to dismiss her, I didn\u2019t really think that was likely\u2014 everybody I met was either friendly to each other, regardless of gender/age/etc, or just kept to themselves and worked out quietly. So I asked what made her feel their vibes were unfriendly. She wasn\u2019t able to answer, so I suggested maybe she simply got that vibe because of their appearance\u2014 there\u2019s a decent amount of people there that are pretty buff, and really buff people can look intimidating even if they\u2019re actually chill people.\n\nShe dismissed that, but I was skeptical since everything she said was about \u2018vibes\u2019 and nothing concrete. But, there\u2019s a possibility that she could be right, so I suggested she and I go at the same time next time she wants to go, to see if I noticed anything too.\n\nI thought that was a good solution, but she lashed out at me, saying I was trying to gaslight her into believing they weren\u2019t mean. I really wasn\u2019t, I\u2019m just trying to square her experiences with what I know, and even am willing to go with her to see if I see what she sees with her.

Plus people working out don\u2019t generally smile and say hi because they are there for their own reasons and if your sister was not used to going to the gym she probably thought they were unfriendly when they were just going about their business.", "I really do not appreciate people using the word \u201cgaslight\u201d so lightly nowadays but no, I do not think you were the A who tried to \u201cgaslight\u201d your sister.

Gaslighting is trying to convince someone of something that you know is false. Like if you'd seen her be bullied, and then you told her it wasn't a big deal. \n\nNTA.", "NTA (barely).\n\nI've been at a gym where one of my co-workers (morbidly obese woman) got made fun of at the gym because of her weight...to her face. I saw it with my own eyes. Even though I fucking hated her, I felt REALLY bad. This is after I lost over 150lbs. I was shocked because at 300ish lbs I never had that experience at ANY gym...but I get where she's coming from. Being fat is hard and the constant shame and guilt of being heavy hits deep.\n\nI think to dismiss what she's saying is an AH move but you don't know what it's like to be in her shoes. However, I think it's really awesome that you wanted to come to the gym with her...but please don't do it as a way to prove you're right, just go because you want to support her until she's comfortable. You're a good big brother.", "NTA\n\nPossibly, your sister is self-conscious. I was 16 once and now I can see how I looked for reasons to sabotage myself because of low self-esteem.  \n\nFirst, you are going to have to convince her you are genuinely trying to help her, you are on her side, and you really do want her to succeed. That's the easy part, the hard part has to come from herself; choosing what she wants for herself over whatever the hell the mean voice in her head is saying to make her quit.", "NTA because you offered to go with her.  You could have been for ignoring her observations which will likely be completely different to what a skinny guy would get, but you didn't dismiss them out of hand so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.", "INFO: you say your sister describes herself as \"overweight\", is she really or is this something she's insecure about?\n\nNot trying to be mean or anything just that I've seen people call their bodies this and that when they look quite the opposite", "NAH. I\u2019m gonna say your sister is obviously self conscious and probably feels like everyone is staring etc. it was good of you to suggest going at the same time and I probably would offer it again. If she declines a second time then it\u2019s all on her.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t feel you were gaslighting at all and you offered a very fair solution.. Your sister might be reading into things too much or she may be feeling unsure about herself right now..\n\n\u2018Hopefully, when she a little calmer,  you can go together and see if her description of what she says happened is in fact, accurate\u2026", "I think it\u2019s a great suggestion! I believe she\u2019s just scared and projecting her emotions onto others.", "NTA - It seems like she was just saying all that stuff because she herself may have been gaslit to believe gym people aren't friendly. Especially since she wasn't able to give any concrete evidence of people being mean to her she just assumed people were looking at her in a mean way. And since you didn't dismiss her feelings and even offered to go with her to check it out for yourself also shows you're NTA.

Depending on where you guys live, I can see people in the gym staring and being rude. People do make fun of fat people at the gym (which is so fucking dumb. Hello, they\u2019re trying to make better choices. Why not encourage them or just mind your biz) so it\u2019s a thing. In this case, I would offer to go with her and observe. If it\u2019s all in her head, then NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve never had that issue, usually when I go to work out I don\u2019t care about what other folks are doing or if they\u2019re even looking at me. But I have seen instances online where fluffy folks are being bullied or recorded. Not saying this is happening here, just saying people do suck.\n\nYou offered the right solution.", "Nta. She can\u2019t even back it up. It\u2019s going to be her excuse to not go and get into shape.", "You weren\u2019t overweight walking in. Your experience as a newbie there could be very unlike hers. \n\nGoing with her is a good idea. Downplaying what she thought she experienced because of what you experienced, not a good idea.\n\nYTA", "NTA.\n\nWhile you shouldn't invalidate someone else's lived experience, you also can't speak to her experiences because she's a girl. Girls are treated different. It is what it is.\n\nThat being said, it doesn't sound like you were being an AH. You were trying to understand what she was experiencing. Making hand waving allegations (\"bad vibes\") is hard to pin down, especially when she's saying she was actively bullied. So it makes sense to follow up.\n\nGyms are weird and stressful places for people who don't go regularly. And yeah, when you walk in you may feel judged and self conscious. It's possible that she made up the whole thing in her head or that it was a legitimate bad experience. Offering to go with her was the right thing to do, but if she's determined to use Tik Tok psychology then that's her problem. Doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA. She couldn't give you any real examples other than people were looking at her in a mean way or what not. \n\nI'm a 30m and I still hate going into a gym when it's busy. I get self-conscious about it and I'm not even out of shape, I just feel awkward. \n\nYour sister may be looking for an excuse not to go or she may legitimately just feel self-conscious trying to work out around others. Suggest she goes at a different time of day when it may be less busy and remind her, the same way I need to remind myself, that no one actually gives a crap about the other people working out. Most people are too focused on what they are doing at the gym to care about someone else getting after it.\n\n\nEdit: Also, remember that we as men like to try and fix things while women in our lives are typically just looking to vent about what they are feeling. She may not have wanted you to say anything but to just listen. I don't know what your relationship with your sister is like but if you guys are close she may have just been leaning on you for support. She's self-conscious and needs to work through those emotions. Hopefully she can work past that and continue her journey to be the person she wants to be and become confident in herself.", "NTA. It seems like she is sensitive, understandably, and may be reading into the situation. It also seems like you are a very convenient target for her hurt feelings. The best thing you could have done was offer to go with her and you've done that. It isn't your fault but you should still give her some space.", "NAH - you're probably right  but she doesn't say this because she wants to annoy you, she says that because her self-esteem is terribly low. You're in a tough spot, but the best I could suggest is to open it up exactly the way you did in your post, plus adding that you understand that it always feels somewhat uncomfortable ro be doing sth completely new. Maybe you could also suggest going together a couple of times until she feels better?", "NTA she could have felt intimidated by the other people there.", "Info: How would going on a different day show you what she was seeing? What if the person who gave off unfriendly vibes isn't there next time? Or they were just having a bad day?\n\nI guess if she said she was experiencing it again next time, and you were literally looking at the same thing the entire time, then you might be able to see the looks, and assess whether they're negative or not. But I don't really understand how future experiences can determine the truth of a past experience.", "NAH I don't think you did anything wrong. But I would probably believe her if she said they gave off bad vibes even if she can't specify exactly what that is. A thin man vs an overweight girl are going to have different experiences at a gym potentially. People who are totally cool and seem normal around guys can be complete sexist assholes. People who are fine with someone thin looking to put on muscle can be disdainful and look down on someone overweight. Not saying for sure that's what happened. But I would keep that in mind with any interaction.", "YTA but mild - she had a bad experience at the gym and can believe that from personal experience as an over-weight woman.  The staff were in the main lovely because they recognised people have to start somewhere. Other people less so - I did get comments that not the right gym (closest to my work and open to everyone) as many of the clients were training for various events and I was a waste of space. And as a young woman, it only takes one or two creeps to make things very uncomfortable. Nothing like her being groped may have happened but if people are watching you and you're already self-conscious, then that is not a pleasant experience. And those creeps aren't going to approach her when she's \"under your protection\". \n\nThe reason for being mild is that you haven't had that experience and it is hard to understand how different people can have very different experience in the same place with the same people.  Be supportive, encourage her to see if woman-only evenings and look at classes like pilates etc so she can build up confidence. Creeps less likely to bother her if instructor there. But don't dismiss her because your experience wasn't her's.", "NTA I had a girlfriend once who always used to say people were staring at her tits. It seemed to happen to her all the time. When I joined the police I got better at situational awareness and would pay attention to my surroundings more, this is when I started to notice that the people she was accusing were not actually looking at her at all. In fact one time some guy was staring directly at me and just after we passed him she goes \u201comg that guy was checking out my tits\u201d which I knew for a fact he was not.\n\nAnyway my point after rambling on is that some people just seem to live in a version of reality that doesn\u2019t match your own. Dunno if it\u2019s in their head, their self esteem or making it up for attention but you are right to ask questions when something doesn\u2019t make sense.", "While I don\u2019t think you are gaslighting your sister, I do appreciate how she might perceive you\u2019re reaction as dismissive. In essence, you are saying that because you have had a positive experience, it is unlikely that someone else (here, your sister) could have a negative experience. There are many reasons why two people can have very different experiences in the same environment or with the same people. Your positive experience doesn\u2019t make you sister\u2019s negative experience impossible. Because your response was dismissive, even if unintentionally so, I\u2019m going with YTA. Next time, try to listen to and fully understand you sister\u2019s perspective and accept it as true for her.", "NTA. She likely just feels insecure about going to the gym while overweight and is making an excuse to quit.", "It sounds like your sister is trying to come up with an excuse to quit the gym, and you're ruining that for her by asking questions and offering to come with her.

NTA.", "Well, she simply doesn't want to go to the gym", "NTA\n\nEven if they were mean to her, what does that have to do with you?  You're not the gym police who patrols the gym telling everyone to be nice.\n\nAlso, the fact that she can't articulate anything specific that people were doing is a pretty telling sign that they didn't do much (if anything).

You had a good experience, she did not. Believe her.\n\nI'm an overweight, middle-aged woman, and I've tried to go to the gym several times. I never could get over all the skinny fit girls looking at me with pity or disgust, not even hiding their disdain. Women can be a lot nastier to other women who don't \"measure up\", and they don't have to say a word.\n\nYou are a guy, so you may never experience that \"vibe\", but it is a very real thing.

I have no doubt that some people made her feel very uncomfortable...but you wouldn't notice them because you would never be the target.", "NTA she\u2019s being a wimp your being factual and facts don\u2019t have feelings be like stone my brother if she wants to quit then let her quit.

So you'll still have to take your sister's word for what happened when she was on her own. Do you really want to help her or just be able to say, see I was right, you're wrong.", "How is that analogous? A skinny dude going to the gym will not be treated the same as a fat girl, that's just the truth. You don't know if there are negative experiences at this gym or not, and apparently you refuse to believe there are unless you personally witness them.\n\nYou really aren't here for judgement, are you? You're going around agreeing with comments that say \"she just doesn't want to go to the gym\" when she's an obese teenaged girl. She's dealing with insecurity and could very well fall into the pit of an eating disorder because she's in the prime demographic. She probably needs someone more supportive than a sibling that insists \"I don't see unfair treatment so it doesn't exist, you're being silly\"\n\nIt does not occur to you to offer her reassurance or even worry about her at all, you just came onto Reddit to get your validation from a crowd that quite often has a bias against fat people because \"oh they just eat too much, if they stop eating they'll be fine\"\n\nI'm a skinny dude too, and when my fat friends have problems while working out, I offer support and try to help to make sure they can workout comfortably like everyone should be able to. I don't say \"well, I think your concerns are invalid and silly, but I can tag along with you so I can investigate whether or not you're being irrational\" \n\nNot an asshole, but yeah, you sound like a bad sibling, but judging by your comment responses you seem fine with that", "Very odd how much more support and loyalty you have for your gym buddies than your sister. Why do you trust them more than her?", "You should really gain the discernment as to when that applies because this is not such a situation. What you\u2019re saying is great when it\u2019s a matter of objective fact (this is not) or when there are actual stakes. Someone saying \u201cI had a bad time at the gym\u201d does not require forensic data to be believed. Even if you don\u2019t believe it - you have nothing to gain by being \u201cright\u201d so just say \u201cat that\u2019s a bummer\u201d and disbelieve her in silence. Having to \u201cprove\u201d something as simple as \u201cI had a bad time\u201d sounds emotionally exhausting.", "Is it also hard for you to be supportive? She's not a liar. Is it that hard for you to say that sounds shitty and offer to go with her as a support person, not to check up on her to make sure she's not lying. \n\nMost people are not going to enjoy being called liars. They're not going to like a loved one being the opposite of supportive. \n\nHonestly, YTA in this situation. Not a giant one, but come on. Cut your sister some slack. Apologize to her. Offer to go with her so she doesn't feel so alone.", "But you can absolutely feel the \"vibe\" in a place, and it doesn't leave physical evidence. Just a gut instinct that makes you feel sick. Especially as a larger woman in a gym. I've been to many gyms over the years. One I walked in, worked out fir 10 mins and left. Nobody said anything, but the looms, the scowls and the general atmosphere was so uncomfortable and made me feel unsafe.\n\nDid j think someone was going to come over and do something to me? No, of course not. But I can see how a much younger, inexperienced young woman could absolutely get that impression. \n\nShe is also 100% right that going with you is irrelevant if she can't go with you every time and if she already feels uncomfortable for whatever reason. My brother always has my back when we go somewhere together, but that doesn't mean when I go to the same places alone I will have the same experience.", "If this is the case, why would you going with her next time somehow be helpful? How would you be better able than your sister to interpret other people? Your comments suggest that you are denying your sister's ability to perceive her environment veridically, which is troublingly belittling.", "No, I have no idea why you\u2019d think that follows from what I said. Body shaming is bad. Just because you\u2019ve been body-shamed doesn\u2019t mean you know women\u2019s experience being body-shamed. There is a gendered aspect to body-shaming.\n\nI would say likewise to a woman that she has no idea what it\u2019s like to be body-shamed for being a chicken-legged man.\n\nAgain, bad in both forms.", "Did you ask them specifically if they had any negative experiences? Because women often have shitty experiences with some jerk and then don't tell everyone about it since it happens to them a lot. Not trying to say one way or the other what happened, but I wouldn't just assume they had no negative experiences because they didn't say something and keep going to the gym.", "I met enough people who had the issue so there is that.", "Ok, but how is that OP's problem?", "You keep saying you're \"open to her being right\". This isn't a question of right or wrong... she feels the way she feels. That's her \"reality\". You seem very concerned with proving her wrong, are you sure you're doing this from a place of kindness?", "Read it again. You\u2019re misreading it.", "No one is going to react any differently to \u201cthere\u2019s a 99% chance your assessment of reality is bullshit\u201d than to \u201cyour assessment of reality is bullshit.\u201d You\u2019re not helping yourself by saying \u201cthere\u2019s a 1% chance you\u2019re not full of shit.\u201d It\u2019s hilarious that you think that exonerates you.", "Studies have also shown that witness testimony\u2014 as in, words\u2014 are flawed due to numerous factors including interpretation of events.\n\nAs for dismissing them, I\u2019m open to her being right, and want to get evidence before I believe her either way. Since I don\u2019t believe her or not believe her yet, I think that\u2019s just being fair rather than dismissing her", "That\u2019s why my plan was to have her walk in first, walk in 10 minutes later, and then observe. And if I wanted to be right, I wouldn\u2019t need to go this much effort, so no.", "I\u2019m not reading all of that.", "Weird assumption but okay.", "What I have to gain is a greater understanding of the situation, which could be used to help her. It\u2019s either people are being mean to her or her self consciousness is leading her to believe that they are, the two have different solutions so knowing which one it is matters.", "If she was trying to get the gym shut down or demanding you no longer go there out of solidarity, then the need for proof would make sense. But she\u2019s asking nothing concrete of you, so why do you need anything concrete from her?", "I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s not lying, or not mistaken. I also don\u2019t know that she is, or that she is mistaken. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still questioning", "I don\u2019t trust things like vibe because there\u2019s absolutely no measure for how much it\u2019s in your head vs actually happening.", "Because some evidence is better than none, even if it\u2019s not perfect.", "I have no idea why you would have asked that question since it literally had NOTHING to do with what I said.  I never claimed to know how it feels to be judged as a female.", "I did ask them specifically since I was concerned they would have faced some sort of meanness, and none of them reported any of that back.", "Because OP\u2019s sister is mad at him", "It\u2019s less so concern with proving her wrong and more so concern for getting a greater understanding of the situation. I want to have some proof on either side, because that will give me a better idea of how to help her. If I know for a fact people *were* being mean to her, or if I knew the issue was her self-consciousness causing that belief, then I\u2019d know what I was dealing with and have some idea of what to do. As it is, since I\u2019m unsure either way, it\u2019s harder to know what to do", "Yes, that is not it.", "> No one is going to react any differently to \u201cthere\u2019s a 99% chance your assessment of reality is bullshit\u201d than to \u201cyour assessment of reality is bullshit.\u201d \n\nSounds like a you problem because most people would.", "> want to get evidence before I believe her either way\n\nNo wonder why she has no confidence in herself, if this is how her family really treats her on the regular. Food for thought.", "You're still letting her know you don't believe her and you're testing her. And if it doesn't happen in those few minutes, you're not going to believe her. I definitely wouldn't want to go with you YTA", "Case in point", "It\u2019s not an assumption, you are saying you don\u2019t believe her. You do believe they are not capable of what she says she experienced. Your default belief is that she misinterpreted or is wrong.", "Regardless invalidating your sisters feelings is what makes you TA, you may not trust the vibe, but she does. Again, understanding the smaller social interactions or vibe around us often keeps women alive. \n\nLike I said, you can just be like \"Well that sucks\" instead of dismissing her thoughts and feelings.", "Because you replied to \u201cBecause skinny guts aren't judged the way overweight women are.\u201d It\u2019s like four comments up. How did you lose the plot in four comments?", "So, let her be mad. She'll get over it. They're kids, they may not even remember this years from now.", "You sound like a kind sibling. But, have you asked her if she *wants* help?", "Maybe, but I\u2019m quite sure you\u2019re not reading it correctly. Maybe you just think it\u2019s OK because you\u2019re in your head about it? I think if we read it together, you\u2019d understand.", "Not in my experience. I highly doubt you\u2019ve experienced any different.", "That\u2019s not such a bad standard to be held to. I am too, I have no issues with it.", "food for thought: op is right, you're wrong", "It\u2019s unreasonable for her to expect me to believe *or* not believe her without any evidence whatsoever.", "Hey, I came here for judgement and got it\u2014 generally overwhelming amounts of NTA.", "Yes, the assumption is that I trust other people more than that in the absence of evidence", "> often keeps women alive. \n\nKind of?

I was commenting against the person who posted that.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTalk about losing the plot...", "I am just explaining why \u201cwhere the thoughts are coming from\u201d are relevant, in regards to this situation.
