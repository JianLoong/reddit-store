{"id": 6856, "submission_id": "106yda3", "title": "AITA for refusing to wake up to take care of our baby", "selftext": "My wife Katie(25F) and I (28M) had our first baby together about 3 months ago. I\u2019m an athlete and Katie\u2019s a stay at home mom. \n\nSleep is very important for me because of my sport. I can\u2019t be waking up multiple times throughout the night and be sleep deprived. Katie and I talked about this before trying for a kid, and I told her that I can\u2019t compromise my sleep for anything short of an emergency. I specifically mentioned that I wouldn\u2019t be waking up during the night to help with the baby, but we could hire a night nurse to help out. \n\nThings had been going smoothly until a few days ago, when Katie was being cold and distant. I asked if something was wrong, and she said everything was fine. She was quiet for a while, then finally mentioned that it\u2019s extremely unfair that I\u2019m not helping her at all with the baby during the night. I acknowledged that she has been working hard and not getting much sleep, but we also previously agreed to this arrangement. \n\nKatie has refused to hire a night nurse to help, because she doesn\u2019t trust someone new to watch our baby alone during the night. I suggested that she could have a family member help, but she didn\u2019t want to burden them. \n\nSo we\u2019ve been at an impasse. She still doesn\u2019t want to hire help, and I\u2019m still not waking up during the night. \n\nAdditional Info: \n\nWe have a maid that cleans and does the laundry multiple times per week, and we also have a meal delivery service that makes a majority of our food. So I\u2019m not just dumping tons of house work on her. \n\nKatie doesn\u2019t have a problem with the maid being around the baby because she\u2019s known her for a while now. \n\nWe\u2019ve also been going to regular doctor and therapist appointments, they don\u2019t think she\u2019s suffering from postpartum.\n\nHiring a night nurse would not be a financial burden, so the cost isn\u2019t the issue. \n\nI spend as much time as I can caring for and bonding with our baby, just not during the night when I\u2019m sleeping.\n\nEDIT FOR CLARITY:\n\nI am a professional athlete, and my sport is our primary source of income.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nSome of you mentioned the idea of doing a test run period with a night nurse helping out during the day while other people are awake and around, which I think is a good idea. \n\nI talked to Katie about hiring a night nurse to temporarily help her out during the day, and she agreed and seemed happy about the idea. That way she can get familiar with the new nurse and feel more comfortable about transitioning to a full night type of arrangement.\n\nShe also apologized for lashing out at me, and explained that she was mostly too embarrassed to ask her family for more help when she already has hired help as a stay at home mom. So we agreed to ask my sister since they have a really good relationship. \n\nMy sister has offered to come by 1 or 2 nights per week to watch our son until Katie\u2019s comfortable having the night nurse be full time and alone. That way Katie immediately gets at least some uninterrupted sleep too for now. \n\nAs some of you figured out I play baseball. Season officially starts in late March with Spring Training late Feb, so I won\u2019t be home much because of the travel schedule. So that at least gives us a couple months to get comfortable with a night nurse/nanny so she isn\u2019t too overwhelmed.\n\nThank you all for the feedback, both good and bad.", "created_utc": 1673221618, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106yda3/aita_for_refusing_to_wake_up_to_take_care_of_our/", "score": 580, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your definitely nta", "NTA, you clearly set boundaries and offered alternatives. \n\nBut maybe you can give a little? Is there a night of the week you can let the wife sleep? Maybe have who ever the night nanny would be over for some day nanny stuff to build trust? You shouldn\u2019t compromise your profession, especially athletic ones that have health/injury risks that would also compromise your future earnings, but maybe this is sign your wife just needs more help than she thought and you gotta adapt somehow.", "NAH. I absolutely sympathize with your wife, I do. It\u2019s SO hard in the beginning. Give her some grace-sleep deprivation is no joke and can totally change a person (temporarily). Is there maybe even one night a week you can help? An off season where you can help a bit?\n\nI hope if things don\u2019t improve with baby\u2019s sleep she will hire a night nurse so she isn\u2019t so resentful, as unfortunately sounds like that\u2019s where things are going. \n\nBest of luck to you all.", "EDIT: \n\nINFO: Are you a professional athlete, and does the family income rely on you playing your sport?\n\nNTA. I'm never a fan of anyone who agrees to something, then decides to be angry at someone else for their decision. Especially when other options are offered.", "NTA. She agreed to this beforehand and has shot down every alternative you've offered.", "NTA as this was something she already agreed to.", "NTA. \n\n\nNormally I\u2019d side with mom 100%. It sucks being the only one getting up with the baby, been there done that twice. With my first, we had a similar understanding. My husband worked early mornings in a field that sleep deprivation was not only unsafe for him, but everyone involved. Was I a bit salty? Yes. But- we agreed on that and had an understanding before hand so I never made a fuss and just soldiered through until the baby slept through the night. So I get your wife\u2019s viewpoint but if she agreed to it and has plenty of help during the day to at least maintain her sanity, it\u2019s just a sucky part of being a new parent.", "INFO How much longer does your season go? And will things be the same in the off season? I assume this isn't Motorsport which would suck for her as those seasons last quite a while but are both technically in the off season now. It is hard when you agree to something without knowing what it would be like. You both heard about it but neither of you actually dealt with it unless one of you had a child before.", "This is the life she chose.

I have a friend who is married to a professional athlete and he would get up and help out.", "She needs to get caught up on sleep at some point. If it's not at night, that's ok, but maybe find a time when she can take a good nap during the day to make up for the sleep she's losing at night. \n\nOr maybe adjust everybody's sleep schedules a bit. Whichever of you is more naturally a night owl gets the later baby duties and the other gets an early bedtime. Whichever is a better early bird gets the morning baby duties and the other gets to sleep in. There's still going to be some overlap where you're both asleep, but it could help. \n\nAnd remember this phase doesn't last forever. Eventually baby will sleep longer stretches and you can both have a full night of sleep.", "NAH, but I think your wife really needs some tender care and appreciation from you. She's probably feeling exhausted and lonely. Perhaps you can talk to her gently about how she is doing?", "INFO: Does she ever get a night of uninterrupted sleep? Like on your days off?", "NTA. Since you say you discussed this in advance and are promoting a reasonable alternative (night nurse) I don't see how you could better solve this problem.. Her expectation that you should still be able to perform as an athlete without a good night's rest is not at all reasonable. Everyone that thinks that you should just be super human and be able to perform as a professional athlete supporting your family with crappy sleep are being obnoxious. The sporting world is not kind to those who suddenly have an immediate down turn in performance and your entire family's lifestyle would be in jeopardy if you pretended you could be superhuman.", "If the night nurse isn\u2019t an option, perhaps a nanny for several hours during the day so she can get a break?", "NTA.

If not or if I wasn't asleep yet then I would get up.\n\nEdit. \n\nSince you edited to say you are a professional athlete then I do say NTA.  At that level not only can lack of sleep affect your playing and endurance it's your main source of income and lack of sleep could cause you injury as well.  \n\nBut out of season you should help at night. Rye short time you'll have to do it will not have any sort of last effect.", "NAH\n\nYou're not one because you need your sleep in order to maintain your performance levels as an athlete.\n\nShe is not one because she doesn't trust a night nurse.  Do you have any family members that would be able to assist in this burden that you can hire to be a night nurse?  Nor her family, but yours?  I know she says she doesn't want to burden them, but maybe someone in either of your families would be interested in doing this.  Because there are some night-owl-ish people out there that this would be a good job for.", "Couples before you have made this agreement, but it is my observation that the agreement that one of you gets out of dealing with overnight wakeups always winds up being a problem. One person winds up sleep deprived and resentful absolutely every damn time.\n\nThere are a bunch of ways for you to help and to still get appropriate amounts of sleep. You and your wife could take shifts, with one of you going to bed early and taking over in the early morning. You could cover a block of time with the baby so she can get some rest during the day. \n\nYour current approach is to tell your partner to either hire someone or suck it up, and that's a YTA for me. I get why hiring a night nurse is worrying - if the maid is a disaster, the only thing at risk is stuff. Your child is a person. It really is different. \n\nAnyway, you need to help work on solutions, not just shrug and tell her it's all her problem.", "NYA you have offered to hire help.", "NTA - the terms were clearly laid out, get the night nurse. See if she\u2019s willing to do a couple of weeks as a day nanny so that your wife can get to know her and she can learn how to look after bubs.", "YTA\n\nWhy have a kid if you don't want to be a dad? Doesn't matter what your job is. You are a dad now too. Be one.", "YTA.  It's kinda hard to agree to something not knowing exactly what you're getting yourself into.  So every single night you have to have perfect sleep? One night a week you could get up to help but you're choosing to hide behind your athlete status.  Do you think all the dads in your trade refuse to be fathers as well?  Perhaps benchmark and see how they've handled it. A newborn is so overwhelming and with your spouse sleeping peacefully beside you who doesn't lift a finger, it gets really hard when you can barely string 2 or 3 hours of sleep together.  By 6 mos, they're gone, guaranteed.", "NTA\u2014 I\u2019m a mom of two and had a baby who had a medical condition that made the first months especially brutal\u2014 and I had to work full time while caring for her whenever I was home.  My husband almost never did a night time feed even though I was the one who had to get up early and was the one working. I still low grade hate him for that. I came to this totally sympathetic to her. \n\nBut caring for one baby is all she\u2019s expected to do, not even cook or clean, and she\u2019s given money to hire a nanny if she wants, too, and has a maid to watch the baby during the day! So if she\u2019s tired from being up at night the maid can watch baby while she sleeps! She has it better than almost every new mother on the planet. \n\nI think you can safely say at this point you\u2019ve offered every solution you can think of but negotiating on your sleep isn\u2019t on the table. The maid can become the day nanny and if she doesn\u2019t want to hire anyone for nights, your wife has become a night nanny of her own child. If half the day watching her own child is too much, she\u2019s not well and needs to accept that and hire someone. \n\nLots of people claim they need their sleep, but most people don\u2019t have jobs they could lose or could get gravely injured on for one bad day like you do\u2014 you\u2019re the only one who knows what it takes for you to perform at this level.", "Can you take over and let her nap during the day at all? Do something so that she isn't the only one responsible for the new tiny human?

He came home and after an hour I handed him the baby, he said \"I'm really tired\" I just burst into tears. It's not the physical work, it's the mental lifting.", "YTA. I feel so bad for your wife and child.", "YTA.\n\nAgreeing to do the night stuff before having a baby and then the reality of being awake multiple times overnight with said baby and then being expected to function like a normal human being in the daytime are two completely different things. Being an athlete is not a reason to refuse to help care for your baby and Katie's concerns about leaving your brand new baby with someone she's never met before are completely valid.\n\nHelp her overnight until you can find a night nurse or come to another arrangement where she is comfortable and your poor wife can get some much needed sleep.", "NTA, this was agreed on before hand and it will affect your only income supporting the family. She has help throughout the day she can train herself and baby and take naps when she does to be rested and awake when the baby is. You\u2019ve offered assistance and she\u2019s denied it.

Surely you can take 1 night every other week, even if you're michael Jordan.

YTA", "let your wife freaking sleep. she is postpartum and needs sleep at night just like you for your precious sport job.", "NAH. She is not being thrown the wolves the way many wives with no help are. However, neither of you FULLY understood how much work a baby was until you had one because no one does. And while in general preserving your sleep in this circumstance is reasonable, she is probably rightly feeling incredibly alone in this aspect of caring for your baby. And honestly if she\u2019s been doing every night since the baby came and you\u2019ve done none, you cannot possibly understand how incredibly exhausting and miserable that can be, no matter how much help you have. No one else can sleep for you. So right now, you\u2019re not an asshole. But you WILL be an asshole if you don\u2019t agree to take a night a week off her plate with the baby. I refuse to believe that you can\u2019t possibly accommodate that without your career suffering. And if you can\u2019t, then how can you can expect her to do it every night. She needs to SLEEP man.

Are you going to expect your wife to always attend to the child because you can't due to your \"sport\" and sleep schedule? Honestly, you should have arraigned something different so you both could co-parent parent together. Does your sport not offer maternal leave? Are you in season? I can already see resentment from both the wife and the child in the future if you constantly deflect any and all responsibilities due to your profession. There are a ton of other high-profile professions where sleep is crucial, and they manage having their sleep schedule disrupted every now and then.

I have a few friends who were in this scenario, and are having to deal with losing their parents at fairly young ages.\n\nHaving kids while still an active pro athlete obviously also has its own cons, especially when travel is considered.

Understanding a reason doesn't mean having to indulge it, and again, \"I'm more interested in you suffering than me not\" doesn't cross the threshold of being harmless to indulge, especially when multiple solutions where neither has to suffer are offered (and apparently now accepted).  \n\nMore to the point, you're the one who introduced the idea of him needing to be inconvenienced, and I'm pretty sure their child isn't making you irrational with constant screaming, so even if she's not rational enough to realize that's a shitty idea, you have no excuse not to be.", "Not to be rude, but you clearly don't know how it works for sportsing folks.  and neither did the wife, or she expected it to change with children.\n\neven during the offseason, they train diligently.   during the season, there is a LOT of travel.  \n\nI'm guessing this is baseball, because the season starts in March.  for approximately 200 days, OP isn't going to be much use other than helping a bit between training and games.   \n\nThis is what she signed up for, even if she didn't quite realize it.  She needs to find a compromise here.  Time to find other teammate's wives/girlfriends for help.", "I play baseball so off season just means there aren\u2019t any games, I\u2019m still training twice a day everyday + doing PT. Spring training is the start of actual sanctioned practice and exhibition games against other teams, not when training actually begins. When the season officially starts I\u2019m going to be gone for the vast majority of roughly seven months, so I won\u2019t see them much. \n\nWhen I\u2019m home between training sessions during the off season I help feed, change, and bath my son. I would say I probably spend around 5 hours a day with him. Which I would guess is actually more than most people with regular jobs. Once he\u2019s a little older, my wife will be able to fly out with him so they can see me between games more often. \n\nMy wife met me when I was already a pro, and she wouldn\u2019t want me to give it up for anything. We\u2019ve spoken and are working on a solution, as posted in the update.", "Mostly it\u2019s the fact that constant lack of sleep is not sustainable. Which OP clearly realises because he isn\u2019t willing to sacrifice any at all. I really feel for his wife who for all she has a partner, is doing all the hard bits of parenting in her own, and is in a situation that only gets worse for her, while he gets to keep doing what he loves, uninterrupted, and be the fun Dad while his sleep deprived wife has all the responsibility. When does his wife get a break? When does she get time for herself like he does?", "I\u2019m glad to see the update. \nI was really feeling for your wife functioning on little sleep, grabbed in snatches. I did it as a carer (parents with dementia aren\u2019t a lot different from toddlers in some respects), and it\u2019s brutal. And honestly sometimes I just wanted support and understanding, and the knowledge that if it did get too much, someone could tag in and take over for a night. It\u2019s a really isolating feeling. And for your wife, knowing you are soon to be around even less must have felt really daunting. \n\nThanks for the clarification on time with your son. It\u2019s more than I thought you\u2019d be saying from your comment. I hoped it was more but wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. \n\nI hope your wife is getting more sleep and feeling better soon."]}
