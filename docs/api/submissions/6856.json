{"id": 6856, "submission_id": "106yda3", "title": "AITA for refusing to wake up to take care of our baby", "selftext": "My wife Katie(25F) and I (28M) had our first baby together about 3 months ago. I\u2019m an athlete and Katie\u2019s a stay at home mom. \n\nSleep is very important for me because of my sport. I can\u2019t be waking up multiple times throughout the night and be sleep deprived. Katie and I talked about this before trying for a kid, and I told her that I can\u2019t compromise my sleep for anything short of an emergency. I specifically mentioned that I wouldn\u2019t be waking up during the night to help with the baby, but we could hire a night nurse to help out. \n\nThings had been going smoothly until a few days ago, when Katie was being cold and distant. I asked if something was wrong, and she said everything was fine. She was quiet for a while, then finally mentioned that it\u2019s extremely unfair that I\u2019m not helping her at all with the baby during the night. I acknowledged that she has been working hard and not getting much sleep, but we also previously agreed to this arrangement. \n\nKatie has refused to hire a night nurse to help, because she doesn\u2019t trust someone new to watch our baby alone during the night. I suggested that she could have a family member help, but she didn\u2019t want to burden them. \n\nSo we\u2019ve been at an impasse. She still doesn\u2019t want to hire help, and I\u2019m still not waking up during the night. \n\nAdditional Info: \n\nWe have a maid that cleans and does the laundry multiple times per week, and we also have a meal delivery service that makes a majority of our food. So I\u2019m not just dumping tons of house work on her. \n\nKatie doesn\u2019t have a problem with the maid being around the baby because she\u2019s known her for a while now. \n\nWe\u2019ve also been going to regular doctor and therapist appointments, they don\u2019t think she\u2019s suffering from postpartum.\n\nHiring a night nurse would not be a financial burden, so the cost isn\u2019t the issue. \n\nI spend as much time as I can caring for and bonding with our baby, just not during the night when I\u2019m sleeping.\n\nEDIT FOR CLARITY:\n\nI am a professional athlete, and my sport is our primary source of income.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nSome of you mentioned the idea of doing a test run period with a night nurse helping out during the day while other people are awake and around, which I think is a good idea. \n\nI talked to Katie about hiring a night nurse to temporarily help her out during the day, and she agreed and seemed happy about the idea. That way she can get familiar with the new nurse and feel more comfortable about transitioning to a full night type of arrangement.\n\nShe also apologized for lashing out at me, and explained that she was mostly too embarrassed to ask her family for more help when she already has hired help as a stay at home mom. So we agreed to ask my sister since they have a really good relationship. \n\nMy sister has offered to come by 1 or 2 nights per week to watch our son until Katie\u2019s comfortable having the night nurse be full time and alone. That way Katie immediately gets at least some uninterrupted sleep too for now. \n\nAs some of you figured out I play baseball. Season officially starts in late March with Spring Training late Feb, so I won\u2019t be home much because of the travel schedule. So that at least gives us a couple months to get comfortable with a night nurse/nanny so she isn\u2019t too overwhelmed.\n\nThank you all for the feedback, both good and bad.", "created_utc": 1673221618, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106yda3/aita_for_refusing_to_wake_up_to_take_care_of_our/", "score": 1773, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe have who ever the night nanny would be over for some day nanny stuff to build trust? You shouldn\u2019t compromise your profession, especially athletic ones that have health/injury risks that would also compromise your future earnings, but maybe this is sign your wife just needs more help than she thought and you gotta adapt somehow.", "NAH. I absolutely sympathize with your wife, I do. It\u2019s SO hard in the beginning. Give her some grace-sleep deprivation is no joke and can totally change a person (temporarily). Is there maybe even one night a week you can help? An off season where you can help a bit?\n\nI hope if things don\u2019t improve with baby\u2019s sleep she will hire a night nurse so she isn\u2019t so resentful, as unfortunately sounds like that\u2019s where things are going. \n\nBest of luck to you all.", "EDIT: \n\nINFO: Are you a professional athlete, and does the family income rely on you playing your sport?\n\nNTA.

She agreed to this beforehand and has shot down every alternative you've offered.", "NTA as this was something she already agreed to.", "NTA. \n\n\nNormally I\u2019d side with mom 100%. It sucks being the only one getting up with the baby, been there done that twice. With my first, we had a similar understanding. My husband worked early mornings in a field that sleep deprivation was not only unsafe for him, but everyone involved. Was I a bit salty? Yes. But- we agreed on that and had an understanding before hand so I never made a fuss and just soldiered through until the baby slept through the night. So I get your wife\u2019s viewpoint but if she agreed to it and has plenty of help during the day to at least maintain her sanity, it\u2019s just a sucky part of being a new parent.", "INFO How much longer does your season go? And will things be the same in the off season? I assume this isn't Motorsport which would suck for her as those seasons last quite a while but are both technically in the off season now.

You both heard about it but neither of you actually dealt with it unless one of you had a child before.", "This is the life she chose.

I have a friend who is married to a professional athlete and he would get up and help out.", "She needs to get caught up on sleep at some point. If it's not at night, that's ok, but maybe find a time when she can take a good nap during the day to make up for the sleep she's losing at night. \n\nOr maybe adjust everybody's sleep schedules a bit. Whichever of you is more naturally a night owl gets the later baby duties and the other gets an early bedtime. Whichever is a better early bird gets the morning baby duties and the other gets to sleep in. There's still going to be some overlap where you're both asleep, but it could help. \n\nAnd remember this phase doesn't last forever. Eventually baby will sleep longer stretches and you can both have a full night of sleep.", "NAH, but I think your wife really needs some tender care and appreciation from you. She's probably feeling exhausted and lonely. Perhaps you can talk to her gently about how she is doing?", "INFO: Does she ever get a night of uninterrupted sleep? Like on your days off?", "NTA. Since you say you discussed this in advance and are promoting a reasonable alternative (night nurse) I don't see how you could better solve this problem.. Her expectation that you should still be able to perform as an athlete without a good night's rest is not at all reasonable. Everyone that thinks that you should just be super human and be able to perform as a professional athlete supporting your family with crappy sleep are being obnoxious. The sporting world is not kind to those who suddenly have an immediate down turn in performance and your entire family's lifestyle would be in jeopardy if you pretended you could be superhuman.", "If the night nurse isn\u2019t an option, perhaps a nanny for several hours during the day so she can get a break?", "NTA.

If not or if I wasn't asleep yet then I would get up.\n\nEdit. \n\nSince you edited to say you are a professional athlete then I do say NTA.  At that level not only can lack of sleep affect your playing and endurance it's your main source of income and lack of sleep could cause you injury as well.  \n\nBut out of season you should help at night. Rye short time you'll have to do it will not have any sort of last effect.", "NAH\n\nYou're not one because you need your sleep in order to maintain your performance levels as an athlete.\n\nShe is not one because she doesn't trust a night nurse.  Do you have any family members that would be able to assist in this burden that you can hire to be a night nurse?  Nor her family, but yours?  I know she says she doesn't want to burden them, but maybe someone in either of your families would be interested in doing this.  Because there are some night-owl-ish people out there that this would be a good job for.", "Couples before you have made this agreement, but it is my observation that the agreement that one of you gets out of dealing with overnight wakeups always winds up being a problem. One person winds up sleep deprived and resentful absolutely every damn time.\n\nThere are a bunch of ways for you to help and to still get appropriate amounts of sleep. You and your wife could take shifts, with one of you going to bed early and taking over in the early morning. You could cover a block of time with the baby so she can get some rest during the day. \n\nYour current approach is to tell your partner to either hire someone or suck it up, and that's a YTA for me. I get why hiring a night nurse is worrying - if the maid is a disaster, the only thing at risk is stuff. Your child is a person. It really is different. \n\nAnyway, you need to help work on solutions, not just shrug and tell her it's all her problem.", "NYA you have offered to hire help.", "NTA - the terms were clearly laid out, get the night nurse. See if she\u2019s willing to do a couple of weeks as a day nanny so that your wife can get to know her and she can learn how to look after bubs.", "YTA\n\nWhy have a kid if you don't want to be a dad? Doesn't matter what your job is. You are a dad now too. Be one.", "YTA.  It's kinda hard to agree to something not knowing exactly what you're getting yourself into.  So every single night you have to have perfect sleep? One night a week you could get up to help but you're choosing to hide behind your athlete status.  Do you think all the dads in your trade refuse to be fathers as well?  Perhaps benchmark and see how they've handled it. A newborn is so overwhelming and with your spouse sleeping peacefully beside you who doesn't lift a finger, it gets really hard when you can barely string 2 or 3 hours of sleep together.  By 6 mos, they're gone, guaranteed.", "NTA\u2014 I\u2019m a mom of two and had a baby who had a medical condition that made the first months especially brutal\u2014 and I had to work full time while caring for her whenever I was home.  My husband almost never did a night time feed even though I was the one who had to get up early and was the one working. I still low grade hate him for that. I came to this totally sympathetic to her. \n\nBut caring for one baby is all she\u2019s expected to do, not even cook or clean, and she\u2019s given money to hire a nanny if she wants, too, and has a maid to watch the baby during the day! So if she\u2019s tired from being up at night the maid can watch baby while she sleeps! She has it better than almost every new mother on the planet. \n\nI think you can safely say at this point you\u2019ve offered every solution you can think of but negotiating on your sleep isn\u2019t on the table. The maid can become the day nanny and if she doesn\u2019t want to hire anyone for nights, your wife has become a night nanny of her own child. If half the day watching her own child is too much, she\u2019s not well and needs to accept that and hire someone. \n\nLots of people claim they need their sleep, but most people don\u2019t have jobs they could lose or could get gravely injured on for one bad day like you do\u2014 you\u2019re the only one who knows what it takes for you to perform at this level.", "Can you take over and let her nap during the day at all? Do something so that she isn't the only one responsible for the new tiny human?

He came home and after an hour I handed him the baby, he said \"I'm really tired\" I just burst into tears. It's not the physical work, it's the mental lifting.", "YTA. I feel so bad for your wife and child.", "YTA.\n\nAgreeing to do the night stuff before having a baby and then the reality of being awake multiple times overnight with said baby and then being expected to function like a normal human being in the daytime are two completely different things. Being an athlete is not a reason to refuse to help care for your baby and Katie's concerns about leaving your brand new baby with someone she's never met before are completely valid.\n\nHelp her overnight until you can find a night nurse or come to another arrangement where she is comfortable and your poor wife can get some much needed sleep.", "NTA, this was agreed on before hand and it will affect your only income supporting the family. She has help throughout the day she can train herself and baby and take naps when she does to be rested and awake when the baby is. You\u2019ve offered assistance and she\u2019s denied it.

Surely you can take 1 night every other week, even if you're michael Jordan.

YTA", "let your wife freaking sleep. she is postpartum and needs sleep at night just like you for your precious sport job.", "NAH. She is not being thrown the wolves the way many wives with no help are. However, neither of you FULLY understood how much work a baby was until you had one because no one does. And while in general preserving your sleep in this circumstance is reasonable, she is probably rightly feeling incredibly alone in this aspect of caring for your baby. And honestly if she\u2019s been doing every night since the baby came and you\u2019ve done none, you cannot possibly understand how incredibly exhausting and miserable that can be, no matter how much help you have. No one else can sleep for you. So right now, you\u2019re not an asshole. But you WILL be an asshole if you don\u2019t agree to take a night a week off her plate with the baby. I refuse to believe that you can\u2019t possibly accommodate that without your career suffering. And if you can\u2019t, then how can you can expect her to do it every night. She needs to SLEEP man.

Are you going to expect your wife to always attend to the child because you can't due to your \"sport\" and sleep schedule? Honestly, you should have arraigned something different so you both could co-parent parent together. Does your sport not offer maternal leave? Are you in season? I can already see resentment from both the wife and the child in the future if you constantly deflect any and all responsibilities due to your profession. There are a ton of other high-profile professions where sleep is crucial, and they manage having their sleep schedule disrupted every now and then.

And for your wife, knowing you are soon to be around even less must have felt really daunting. \n\nThanks for the clarification on time with your son.

He works and I stay home. He does 12 hour shifts about four days a week. Once our LO came along the new born stage was HARD. I was doing four days back to back alone with very little help. He done what he could. Around 3 months we started fighting bc I was just so worn out. I wasn\u2019t sleeping. It was never over an hour and a half at a time. I told him I would have never agreed to this if I KNEW how hard it was and how dangerously sleep deprived I was going to get. He was doing most of the cooking around this time and he helped me clean on his off days. It\u2019s just hard. Before I had my baby, I would have agreed with you. Now that I have her and first hand experience, I think you need to remember y\u2019all decided to have this kid together and created this kid together. Being the only source of income isn\u2019t a good enough excuse to not ever help at night. The hard parts are at night. The cry inducing parts are at night. Just babies are hard without anything else added to it. Not sleeping on your normal schedule for months at a time is HARD. Being up and down all night for months even if you don\u2019t cook or clean all day is exhausting. The fact that you just won\u2019t at all doesn\u2019t sit right.

That's perfectly reasonable in my book, which is also why I said at the end of my comment to look at alternatives etc. which she would be comfortable with. I wouldn't have wanted family to look after my newborn overnight either so I can completely understand that. \n\nI'm afraid I don't see how her having a maid has anything to do with her having and caring for a baby. She is looking after another human being 24/7. She apparently doesn't get a break because her husband works in the day and then sleeps all night. Looking after the baby alone is a full time job in itself never mind the housework and cleaning as well. OP needs to support his wife with baby at the moment.", "I haven't skewed it, I just have a different opinion. Yes she agreed to looking after the baby overnight, she then had the baby (we have no idea about the birth and how traumatic that may have been either) and 3 months in is absolutely shattered because she has no support overnight from the person who helped her make the baby.\n\nI appreciate he is offering alternatives, but again, having been an anxious new mother very recently, I can completely understand her perspective. She has this tiny baby. She knows its needs, she knows its cries, she's been with it every second of every day and responds exactly how she wants someone to respond to her tiny baby. The baby can't tell her if it's neglected when she's not there, if someone doesn't respond in the way she'd expect, if they don't meet baby's needs the way she would expect. You're asking her to put the life of her only, brand new, baby in the hands of someone else. That requires a massive level of trust, which she isn't ready for at the moment.\n\nWith family, I would feel the same. Grandparents have preconceived ideas about how babies should be raised because of how they raised their babies. We also don't know the family dynamics and how she feels about her own childhood etc.\n\nFrom my perspective its not just a simple case of handing the baby over to someone else and going to sleep, she'd need massive amounts of trust and reassurance to actually be able to rest whilst the baby was cared for by someone else anyway. \n\nI also only said that he should help his wife until they could come up with an alternative that she was happy with.", "If she had lots of help she wouldn't be asking him for help.

I'm glad you found a compromise and good luck with your season (but only if you play for the Blue Jays...lol)!", "I love that some 28 year olds can get married, be responsible people, while other are on their tenth baby mama, not WIfe. good job sir...", "I'm incredibly amused by the people replying to this who have no idea how training for professional sports works these days. People who probably don't even watch sports sure do feel strongly about stuff \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnyways, you're NTA. I've got a brand new baby, too. Same age. You just focus on keeping those damn Padres out of the divisional race, alright?", "NTA. Your wife is spoiled.", "YTA. \n\nHaving a kid, either by planning or accident is a huge comittment and one that is shared by both parties. Most parents will tell you that the hardest part of having a child is the first 2-5 months wherein the baby is in its \"witching hour\" (had to look that up but thats the 'proper' term) this time is extremely stressful upon both parties as it requires for them to wake up often multiple times a night to tend to the child.\n\nIts very unfair for your wife to have them be sole person waking up. Its not going to hurt or harm your career by waking up even just 2 or 3 times during a week. There are thousands of successfull and very skilled athletes who can still wake up during the night to care for their child and be successfull in their sport.\n\nCaring for your child in these moments will certainly become treasured moments of your life and you will regret it later in life that you werent part of this moment in your childs early life.", "My kid NEVER slept. It broke both of us after like 2 months. If I had the option of a night nurse, you wouldn't have to ask me twice.", "You must have mad skillz to play pro baseball. I'm impressed. Now teach yourself to bowl with a straight arm and you could come to the UK and play cricket! I'm joking mate the weather's awful and nobody likes cricket here because we always lose to Australians.", "YTA. It\u2019s the off season. Wake the f up at night", "Yes you are. During your offseason you can wake up 2-3 nights a week and help out. I\u2019m speaking as a dad", "YTA. You're a father now. Act like one.", "I still think a small YTA, sleep deprivation is itself horrible regardless of housework or not. It's good you coming up with solutions..what she needs is a break and a chance to catch up on sleep. Can you do the bedtime once a week? So she can say go to bed early and you do the first feed then she picks it up after? ( assuming you go to bed after 9pm) or even a weekend block of time..if you can it would help your wife, but more than that you get to create one on one memories with your child..and trust me you blink and they are 18", "I really cannot decide. When does Mum get time off? When does Dad actually parent his child. I can see why she might be getting shirty, all day she has the baby because he is working. All night she has the baby because he is sleeping. I mean, is it a big ask to ask a parent to, well, parent? Its not reasonable to make a baby and not expect your life to have to change. A nanny is an option here, yes, but he is still off the hook with all the responsibility. I feel sorry for baby and Mum.", "NTA but I think you realize that lack of sleep has an impact on anyone whether they are at home or not. When we adopted our daughter, I stayed home with her until my maternity leave ran out. My husband worked but knew how tired I was by the weekend. He took night duties on Friday & Saturday night so I could have two days of uninterrupted sleep. \nGive her some grace as she is a tired mama but since your season hasn\u2019t started yet, could you give her a night? I read the edit and the idea of hiring the night nurse during the day for a while is a great idea. In all, you are lucky to have so many possible alternatives and I\u2019m sure it will work out.", "You sympathize with the wife who is a sahm and has a maid, food service, and he says can get a night nurse lmao, his wife is spoiled and lazy.", "True ppl agree to things in the moment and later on find out that they shouldnt so they take out their fustration on you its screwed up", "I feel like hiring a relative is the simplest solution.\n\nIt isn't a burden if they get paid.", "Exactly this^\n\nI\u2019m a stay at home mom with a new born and a toddler and I take care of the house and our babies, night and day while my husband is running a business.\n\nShe is getting so much help most stay at home moms do a lot more and don\u2019t have all the help she has. It\u2019s not like he is not offering a solution.\n\nShe says it isn\u2019t fair that she has to do everything but her job is taking care of the baby that\u2019s what a stay at home mom is\u2026 it\u2019s hard but that\u2019s what she agreed to, that\u2019s why you are the one working to support her and your child.", "Dangerous lol. So much drama and so little logic.", "She is definitely TA because she has everything done for her except waking up at night, which she is still whining about.", "If OP is truly a professional athlete earning good money, then I don\u2019t think your suggestion is the right thing to do.\n\nPro athlete careers are short, your prime is even shorter. The money you make in that time can secure your entire bloodline\u2019s future. You only get one chance.\n\nGranted, this isn\u2019t a normal scenario, but it\u2019s the one they\u2019re in. When the actual season starts, OP certainly won\u2019t be doing a day a week. They have enough money to throw at this that many other couples do not. The mother needs to find a way to make the night nurse work, imo.", "Um. Who\u2019s going to pay for the child if he quits his job? I call hardly see her enjoying life without his cozy income.", "Bet she resents him more if he loses his high paying job and she loses her cushy life.", "The difference is that she does nothing in their house (nanny, cleaner, chef) because he is working as athelete. Now imagine he get injured. All their lives go shit only because she doesnt want a night nurse lol", "I think it's so weird not everyone has exact this opinion... Actually very concerning.", "Please don\u2019t. Smells bad.", "Because of some medications they were on at the time, my spouse was incapable of doing any baby stuff after they went to bed. We ended up arranging it so I went to sleep at 7 and they went to sleep at midnight after supervising a feed (side lying nursing, I barely had to wake up) and changing the diaper, so I got to sleep from 7 to 2-3 uninterrupted while they slept from 12-8.", "Exactly! I mean some jobs have slack built into them (mine definitely) but competitive jobs like pro sports? Where there's a thousand dudes hungry to fill your shoes? Nuh uh", "But she is offered lots of help, just not from her husband. And it\u2019s not like she has to clean. \n\nCan\u2019t be lazy all your life", "First sentence is trash. Babies aren\u2019t unknown quantities. Having a kid was exactly as everyone described and it was not hard at all to figure that out in advance.", "Wow and she puts her health at risk by giving 200% at night and he gives 0%", "And she does not work, has a maid. She can nap during the day like most mothers these days cannot. Thats her one job, to get up and take care of the child.", "I don't even get that, regularly getting only 5 hours of sleep is linked to increased risk of premature death, it's actually incredibly dangerous. I don't know anyone who would say 5 hours is enough. There is a phenotype that can tolerate such short sleep periods long term without deleterious effects but it's rare.", "\u2018She needs to get paid\u2019 gtfoh .  He\u2019s the breadwinner and if he\u2019s a pro athlete I\u2019m sure she gets the perks 99% of other stay at home moms would dream of.", "Seriously. Wtf is this post? She basically has nothing to do except deal with the baby.", "Lol this is hilarious. So, what alternatives are you suggesting that she might be more comfortable with? Family and night nurse, a damn NIGHT NURSE, are about the top two options. Kinda the only two options. So, what alternatives do you suggest?", "Also, even though her situation is luxurious compared to a lot of new mothers, it\u2019s not unusual to be sleep deprived, anxious, and isolated in the early days. He says they\u2019ve ruled out postpartum depression, but, even if she\u2019s not diagnosably depressed, her emotions are certainly running high. She might not be acting totally rational right now, but it\u2019s great that he\u2019s both offering solutions and being patient as she adjusts to this big life change.", "She\u2019s his wife.", "She works and this is not her one job.  Are you kidding?", "The grown ass woman he\u2019s married too also has a say on the relationship lol. He didn\u2019t hold a gun to her head while they were bf & gf. \n\nIf you date a professional athlete or are even familiar with the sport, you can likely take a rough guess on how much time they\u2019re spending away from home/ how busy they are. (Just based on schedule) \n\nBut you\u2019re not wrong. Considering any pro\u2019s career can be cut short because of unforeseen reasons, it\u2019s even more important to be on top of his game all the time and not be disrupting his sleep to do something his partner in life (or a hire) is also capable of doing. \n\nBabies and raising kids in general is incredibly hard. Even with two people. But OP has laid out options to relieve her of some responsibilities that he can\u2019t take on. It\u2019s a win/win for them.", "Puppies here, and same thing. I've had to pull out all the stops to save dying puppies, nebulizer multiple times a day, 24/7 in an oxygen box (hooked up to an oxygen concentrator), tube feeding round the clock. It's brutal and after a few weeks, you feel like you can barely function even in the day time. But like you said, it's only for maximum 6-7 weeks and the animal either lives or dies and if it lives, it's old enough to eat on its own by then.", "Oh I'm having flashbacks to when we adopted the latest kitten... He had to have a bottle every 2 hours for a couple weeks. I told him over and over how lucky he was that he's so cute. But I walked into the situation knowing what I might have to deal with. If I hadn't known it would have been a real shock! I was also delirious after a couple days because it doesn't even matter how many hours of sleep you total, if you're waking up every two hours it's not decent quality and can actually make you feel worse emotionally because, \"why did I bother falling asleep when I barely close my eyes and have to be right back up!\"\n\n I remember my step sister going to the ER with her son because he was on medication that kept him from sleeping basically at all and she was starting to hallucinate. So she begged the nurses to just watch him while she slept. They did, thankfully. I was halfway across the country so couldn't do anything except day how proud I was of her for getting the help she needed before something terrible happened.", "My son still doesn\u2019t sleep well. He\u2019s 9.", "Your wife is spoiled and lazy, she hit the lottery with you.", "So whilst your not working at the moment why can\u2019t you help with night feeds?", "Congrats on being an idiot. What a good achievement", "So the solution only matters as long as he\u2019s inconvenienced ? It doesn\u2019t matter that the solutions would fix the problem, what\u2019s matters is he\u2019s equally inconvenienced?", "You\u2019re exaggerating. It wasn\u2019t that bad. Having people do the hard stuff like cooking and cleaning makes taking care of the baby much, _much_ easier. It\u2019s pathetic, actually, to think you can\u2019t do anything for the first few months. This sub makes me realize how much better my spouse is than most. Geez.", "Why is your judgement Y T A when you seem to agree with OP that his job is important?", "True that, thanks. Edited my post accordingly.", "What are you talking about? She's a sahm with household help. The baby is her only job, and while it's valid for a 1st time mom to be overwhelmed, OP has already suggested several solutions, she needs to compromise somewhere.", "Kiddo is 5 and had me up for an hour last night.", "they're an athlete, training is working", "Pro athletes, especially MLB players, tend to have pretty good to amazing relationships with their children. It's wild to me that people think not waking up during the night means you will be irreparably damaging your relationship with your child", "They're calling that commenters an asshole", "You don\u2019t seem all there??\u2026", "By that standard being a SAHM is a job also? I refuse to believe he can\u2019t get up once during the night especially since the season hasn\u2019t even started. The wife probably hasn\u2019t had a night sleep since the baby was born but she has to get up at night and do the feeds then get up in the morning with the baby and start her day job. Whilst he gets a full nights sleep?", "That makes more sense!", "What do you mean? I think it\u2019s been cleared up as someone else explained they were calling the commenter they were replying to an Asshole", "savings. get another job. hell, mom can go to work and he can watch the kid. like any other family does. he makes enough money there's a giant pillow to catch them there.", "No it doesn\u2019t by that standard. Training counts as his job because it\u2019s directly related to their income. He doesn\u2019t train = he loses his job and they\u2019re all homeless.", "Obviously that\u2019s why they are saying it?\u2026..", "Do you understand how tight the margins are to go pro at a sport and for it to just be a hobby you\u2019re good at?
