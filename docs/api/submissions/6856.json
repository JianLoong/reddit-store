I\u2019m an athlete and Katie\u2019s a stay at home mom. \n\nSleep is very important for me because of my sport. I can\u2019t be waking up multiple times throughout the night and be sleep deprived. Katie and I talked about this before trying for a kid, and I told her that I can\u2019t compromise my sleep for anything short of an emergency. I specifically mentioned that I wouldn\u2019t be waking up during the night to help with the baby, but we could hire a night nurse to help out. \n\nThings had been going smoothly until a few days ago, when Katie was being cold and distant. I asked if something was wrong, and she said everything was fine. She was quiet for a while, then finally mentioned that it\u2019s extremely unfair that I\u2019m not helping her at all with the baby during the night. I acknowledged that she has been working hard and not getting much sleep, but we also previously agreed to this arrangement. \n\nKatie has refused to hire a night nurse to help, because she doesn\u2019t trust someone new to watch our baby alone during the night. I suggested that she could have a family member help, but she didn\u2019t want to burden them. \n\nSo we\u2019ve been at an impasse. She still doesn\u2019t want to hire help, and I\u2019m still not waking up during the night. \n\nAdditional Info: \n\nWe have a maid that cleans and does the laundry multiple times per week, and we also have a meal delivery service that makes a majority of our food. So I\u2019m not just dumping tons of house work on her. \n\nKatie doesn\u2019t have a problem with the maid being around the baby because she\u2019s known her for a while now. \n\nWe\u2019ve also been going to regular doctor and therapist appointments, they don\u2019t think she\u2019s suffering from postpartum.\n\nHiring a night nurse would not be a financial burden, so the cost isn\u2019t the issue. \n\nI spend as much time as I can caring for and bonding with our baby, just not during the night when I\u2019m sleeping.\n\nEDIT FOR CLARITY:\n\nI am a professional athlete, and my sport is our primary source of income.", "created_utc": 1673221618, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106yda3/aita_for_refusing_to_wake_up_to_take_care_of_our/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your definitely nta", "NTA, you clearly set boundaries and offered alternatives. \n\nBut maybe you can give a little? Is there a night of the week you can let the wife sleep? Maybe have who ever the night nanny would be over for some day nanny stuff to build trust? You shouldn\u2019t compromise your profession, especially athletic ones that have health/injury risks that would also compromise your future earnings, but maybe this is sign your wife just needs more help than she thought and you gotta adapt somehow.", "NAH. I absolutely sympathize with your wife, I do. It\u2019s SO hard in the beginning. Give her some grace-sleep deprivation is no joke and can totally change a person (temporarily). Is there maybe even one night a week you can help? An off season where you can help a bit?\n\nI hope if things don\u2019t improve with baby\u2019s sleep she will hire a night nurse so she isn\u2019t so resentful, as unfortunately sounds like that\u2019s where things are going. \n\nBest of luck to you all.", "EDIT: \n\nINFO: Are you a professional athlete, and does the family income rely on you playing your sport?\n\nNTA. I'm never a fan of anyone who agrees to something, then decides to be angry at someone else for their decision. Especially when other options are offered.", "NTA. She agreed to this beforehand and has shot down every alternative you've offered.", "NTA as this was something she already agreed to.", "NTA. \n\n\nNormally I\u2019d side with mom 100%. It sucks being the only one getting up with the baby, been there done that twice. With my first, we had a similar understanding. My husband worked early mornings in a field that sleep deprivation was not only unsafe for him, but everyone involved. Was I a bit salty? Yes. But- we agreed on that and had an understanding before hand so I never made a fuss and just soldiered through until the baby slept through the night. So I get your wife\u2019s viewpoint but if she agreed to it and has plenty of help during the day to at least maintain her sanity, it\u2019s just a sucky part of being a new parent.", "INFO How much longer does your season go? And will things be the same in the off season? I assume this isn't Motorsport which would suck for her as those seasons last quite a while but are both technically in the off season now. It is hard when you agree to something without knowing what it would be like. You both heard about it but neither of you actually dealt with it unless one of you had a child before.", "This is the life she chose. Can\u2019t really get all sour about it now.", "NTA but you are missing out on some serious bonding time. I have a friend who is married to a professional athlete and he would get up and help out.", "She needs to get caught up on sleep at some point. If it's not at night, that's ok, but maybe find a time when she can take a good nap during the day to make up for the sleep she's losing at night. \n\nOr maybe adjust everybody's sleep schedules a bit. Whichever of you is more naturally a night owl gets the later baby duties and the other gets an early bedtime. Whichever is a better early bird gets the morning baby duties and the other gets to sleep in. There's still going to be some overlap where you're both asleep, but it could help. \n\nAnd remember this phase doesn't last forever. Eventually baby will sleep longer stretches and you can both have a full night of sleep.", "NAH, but I think your wife really needs some tender care and appreciation from you. She's probably feeling exhausted and lonely. Perhaps you can talk to her gently about how she is doing?", "INFO: Does she ever get a night of uninterrupted sleep? Like on your days off?", "NTA. Since you say you discussed this in advance and are promoting a reasonable alternative (night nurse) I don't see how you could better solve this problem.. Her expectation that you should still be able to perform as an athlete without a good night's rest is not at all reasonable. Everyone that thinks that you should just be super human and be able to perform as a professional athlete supporting your family with crappy sleep are being obnoxious. The sporting world is not kind to those who suddenly have an immediate down turn in performance and your entire family's lifestyle would be in jeopardy if you pretended you could be superhuman.", "If the night nurse isn\u2019t an option, perhaps a nanny for several hours during the day so she can get a break?", "NTA.  This seems to have been the situation you both walked into.  It also seems she has help.", "On days when you aren\u2019t working would you be willing to take the baby so she can atleast get a solid block of sleep a couple times a week?

If not or if I wasn't asleep yet then I would get up.\n\nEdit. \n\nSince you edited to say you are a professional athlete then I do say NTA.  At that level not only can lack of sleep affect your playing and endurance it's your main source of income and lack of sleep could cause you injury as well.  \n\nBut out of season you should help at night. Rye short time you'll have to do it will not have any sort of last effect.", "NAH\n\nYou're not one because you need your sleep in order to maintain your performance levels as an athlete.\n\nShe is not one because she doesn't trust a night nurse.  Do you have any family members that would be able to assist in this burden that you can hire to be a night nurse?  Nor her family, but yours?  I know she says she doesn't want to burden them, but maybe someone in either of your families would be interested in doing this.  Because there are some night-owl-ish people out there that this would be a good job for.", "Couples before you have made this agreement, but it is my observation that the agreement that one of you gets out of dealing with overnight wakeups always winds up being a problem. One person winds up sleep deprived and resentful absolutely every damn time.\n\nThere are a bunch of ways for you to help and to still get appropriate amounts of sleep. You and your wife could take shifts, with one of you going to bed early and taking over in the early morning. You could cover a block of time with the baby so she can get some rest during the day. \n\nYour current approach is to tell your partner to either hire someone or suck it up, and that's a YTA for me. I get why hiring a night nurse is worrying - if the maid is a disaster, the only thing at risk is stuff. Your child is a person. It really is different. \n\nAnyway, you need to help work on solutions, not just shrug and tell her it's all her problem.", "NYA you have offered to hire help.", "NTA - the terms were clearly laid out, get the night nurse. See if she\u2019s willing to do a couple of weeks as a day nanny so that your wife can get to know her and she can learn how to look after bubs.", "YTA\n\nWhy have a kid if you don't want to be a dad? Doesn't matter what your job is. You are a dad now too. Be one.", "YTA.  It's kinda hard to agree to something not knowing exactly what you're getting yourself into.  So every single night you have to have perfect sleep? One night a week you could get up to help but you're choosing to hide behind your athlete status.  Do you think all the dads in your trade refuse to be fathers as well?  Perhaps benchmark and see how they've handled it. A newborn is so overwhelming and with your spouse sleeping peacefully beside you who doesn't lift a finger, it gets really hard when you can barely string 2 or 3 hours of sleep together.  By 6 mos, they're gone, guaranteed.", "NTA\u2014 I\u2019m a mom of two and had a baby who had a medical condition that made the first months especially brutal\u2014 and I had to work full time while caring for her whenever I was home.  My husband almost never did a night time feed even though I was the one who had to get up early and was the one working. I still low grade hate him for that. I came to this totally sympathetic to her. \n\nBut caring for one baby is all she\u2019s expected to do, not even cook or clean, and she\u2019s given money to hire a nanny if she wants, too, and has a maid to watch the baby during the day! So if she\u2019s tired from being up at night the maid can watch baby while she sleeps! She has it better than almost every new mother on the planet. \n\nI think you can safely say at this point you\u2019ve offered every solution you can think of but negotiating on your sleep isn\u2019t on the table. The maid can become the day nanny and if she doesn\u2019t want to hire anyone for nights, your wife has become a night nanny of her own child. If half the day watching her own child is too much, she\u2019s not well and needs to accept that and hire someone. \n\nLots of people claim they need their sleep, but most people don\u2019t have jobs they could lose or could get gravely injured on for one bad day like you do\u2014 you\u2019re the only one who knows what it takes for you to perform at this level.", "Can you take over and let her nap during the day at all? Do something so that she isn't the only one responsible for the new tiny human? She is feeling overwhelmed; my husband went away for a week when my son was 4 weeks old, the feeling of not being able to even take a breath  was horrible. He came home and after an hour I handed him the baby, he said \"I'm really tired\" I just burst into tears. It's not the physical work, it's the mental lifting.", "YTA. I feel so bad for your wife and child.", "YTA.\n\nAgreeing to do the night stuff before having a baby and then the reality of being awake multiple times overnight with said baby and then being expected to function like a normal human being in the daytime are two completely different things. Being an athlete is not a reason to refuse to help care for your baby and Katie's concerns about leaving your brand new baby with someone she's never met before are completely valid.\n\nHelp her overnight until you can find a night nurse or come to another arrangement where she is comfortable and your poor wife can get some much needed sleep.", "NTA, this was agreed on before hand and it will affect your only income supporting the family. She has help throughout the day she can train herself and baby and take naps when she does to be rested and awake when the baby is. You\u2019ve offered assistance and she\u2019s denied it. She\u2019s being cranky bcz her sleep is off it\u2019ll get better she sucks for trying to go back on your agreement but it\u2019s probably she\u2019s just cranky", "It sounds like yall are kush as it gets but having been the sleep deprived parent next to a hibernating bear- its game changing to have just 1 night of sleep every other week. Surely you can take 1 night every other week, even if you're michael Jordan. You'll also want to know in years down the road that you were there for some of those sleepy, snuggly feeds with your peanut. Middle of the night feeds and snuggles are just special....don't miss all of them, even if you have so much help that you don't wipe your own ass.", "So you need your beauty sleep? Get your bum off the bed and take care of the kid. This is what parenting is.\n\nAnd research a reputable nurse service for when the season begins.", "YTA. You\u2019re a dad now. I don\u2019t care that you\u2019re an athlete.", "YTA she didn't make that baby by herself, so put on your big boy pants and do your part.", "You had this kid together, you are responsible for raising it together. YTA", "let your wife freaking sleep. she is postpartum and needs sleep at night just like you for your precious sport job.", "NAH. She is not being thrown the wolves the way many wives with no help are. However, neither of you FULLY understood how much work a baby was until you had one because no one does. And while in general preserving your sleep in this circumstance is reasonable, she is probably rightly feeling incredibly alone in this aspect of caring for your baby. And honestly if she\u2019s been doing every night since the baby came and you\u2019ve done none, you cannot possibly understand how incredibly exhausting and miserable that can be, no matter how much help you have. No one else can sleep for you. So right now, you\u2019re not an asshole. But you WILL be an asshole if you don\u2019t agree to take a night a week off her plate with the baby. I refuse to believe that you can\u2019t possibly accommodate that without your career suffering. And if you can\u2019t, then how can you can expect her to do it every night. She needs to SLEEP man. At least once in awhile. At some point it becomes unsafe to be looking after a child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because you also neglecting the needs of your child. How is this going to work out once the child gets older and needs something? Are you going to expect your wife to always attend to the child because you can't due to your \"sport\" and sleep schedule? Honestly, you should have arraigned something different so you both could co-parent parent together. Does your sport not offer maternal leave? Are you in season? I can already see resentment from both the wife and the child in the future if you constantly deflect any and all responsibilities due to your profession. There are a ton of other high-profile professions where sleep is crucial, and they manage having their sleep schedule disrupted every now and then. There are numerous other professions that greatly impact society more than athletics that have newborns and take responsibility.

She agreed, and that's why they went forward with having a baby. He does help during the day when he is home, the only thing he doesn't do is wake up throughout the night because that would impact his ability to do his job.", "He's earning a big wage, got a roof over their heads, pays for a maid and meal delivery service. I think he's doing more than enough.", "He's a professional athlete and being an athlete is his JOB. His job requires him to be fully awake and alert, so he cannot just stay up all night. \n\nHe even offered solutions and was rejected at every turn. \n\nWhat about that do you not understand?", "So why won't she accept a night nurse or a family member to help out? You cannot agree to a precedent before agreeing to have a child, to then turn and get upset when the realities of having a child coming crashing down on you. The OP has even offered the alternatives i've written in the first line. He cannot do anymore.", "If it's not playing or training season, you can be flexible and help care for your child. A couple nights of disrupted sleep, during your off season no less, is not going to harm your career. It could help your wife feel loved, though. Knowing her husband will support her when she desperately needs it will only help your marriage.", "So your wife does all night, and the morning, and then maybe gets a nap. \nOne nap, a day. \n\nAnd you \u201cspend time with your son\u201d (feeding? Bathing? Cleaning? Diaper changing? Or just having fun time?) for how long?  And this is you when you are being a present parent. So it\u2019s going to get worse, not better. \n\nOnce you are in active season how much time per day will you be parenting your child? \n\nWhat time do you sign off your parenting duties? And what ti e do you get up in the morning,a and do you do anything for your wife and child before heading out?\n\nI am *baffled* at how you thought it was a good idea to have a kid when you are not able to do do any of the hard work. \n\nYou need to find a way to help your wife feel supported. You may not be an AH, but neither is she, and this situation is untenable.", "So it\u2019s not your active season and you can\u2019t be bothered to keep her company even one night a week or something? I expect she is exhausted and lonely sitting up at night on her own every night. Have some compassion for the person you claim to love. I doubt the odd night will end your career. YTA", "Never said it was. I am sure there is some room given that he is out of season until March to do a couple of night feeds with her. At the moment he just wants to throw money at the problem rather than working with her and showing he supports her rather than just paying for someone else to do his part as a father", "He suggested asking family members to help some nights, they can't be strangers surely? He's not being selfish, you just have unfairly targeted the man in this arrangement.", "Yeah, I get what they agreed to pre-baby. I\u2019m just thinking about what it means for the relationships.", "Are you saying all of those things exclude him from the basic acts of being a parent?  I dont. think he needs to get up all time but getting up once or twice isn\u2019t going to kill him. I\u2019ll bet you other professional athletes still act like dads too", "What is it about the fact that people can have options that differ from yours that you don\u2019t understand?", "She doesn't trust others. this is something that happens when you lose sleep. She most likely sees him sleeping, and literally cannot understand why he can't even lift a damn finger or wake up even once a week during the night to help out.\n\nthere is a LOT more to this, but I'm just gonna say that with his income, they could live comfortably and even if he \"lost his job\", it's better than losing his wife or kid.\n\nhe needs to learn that being a parent takes sacrifice. and that may mean oh no. he gets up an hour earlier or stays up an hour later. he's missing bonding time, she's literally missing basic human functions and needs.\n\nher mom senses have clicked into triple overtime and his solution is to throw more money at it or anyone else other than him?\n\nsounds like a shitty way to live life.", "I mean, he's tried, she's just refusing everything and anything other than the one thing he warned her repeatedly would be an issue beforehand.", "Why can\u2019t the child\u2019s father help some nights? He is out of season until March. As I said I am sure the odd night won\u2019t end his career", "I mean, there are pros and cons to both scenarios. Retirement for many athletes can be quite late in life, and if they and their partner want a child the old fashioned way, that could very well make it impossible to do so. Having children at older ages can also have a negative impact on children, especially if you have a newborn at 50+. I have a few friends who were in this scenario, and are having to deal with losing their parents at fairly young ages.\n\nHaving kids while still an active pro athlete obviously also has its own cons, especially when travel is considered. However, children of professional athletes often get to experience a lot in life of travelling and such. \n\nEvery relationship is going to be different, and depending on that will determine what it means for each of them, but either way, I think there could end up being resentment (either having to wait until an older age than wanted, or having to be the parent who does all of the night care)", "He would lose his job at a professional level due to lack of sleep affecting his performance. The margins are that fine, thats the reality of playing that high up. The other professional athletes have night nurses according to the OP, something his partner has refused.\n\nHe stated he would be happy to become a parent on the agreement he was able to be well rested for his job, she agreed to that so you absolutely cannot beat him with that stick i'm afraid.", "I don't know what's confusing you.\n\nOP has a job.\n\nOP requires adequate sleep in order to perform at that job and earn an income that supports the entire family. \n\nOP's family has hired help. \n\nOP offered a variety of solutions that were great compromises, such as hiring additional help.\n\nWife said no.\n\nNothing that OP offered was bad, even offering night time help is great so wife can rest, the wife just doesn't want those options. \n\nShort of quitting his job, what else is he supposed to do?", "I get the not doing the nights. Mostly. I think that particularly during off season he could be doing a late night or early morning feed to give her a chunk of uninterrupted sleep. \n\nIt\u2019s the fact that she follows a night of interrupted sleep with him out all morning for training and whatever. So there is no relief for her to be found there either. I really am not getting a good idea of how much time he\u2019s actually spending with his child, and what he\u2019s doing in that time.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if a morning nanny is a better option than a night one, so that at least if she\u2019s not going to sleep at night, she could sleep in the mornings to get some recovery and energy. \n\nBut what worries me is that he\u2019s also planning that from February, for however long the season is, he\u2019s going to be completely not available, knowing his wife is already not coping. \nThis is not going to end well. His wife needs to feel emotionally supported and he\u2019s not giving her that. She probably feels like she\u2019s doing this alone, because his life hasn\u2019t changed at all, he\u2019s continuing as per normal."]}
