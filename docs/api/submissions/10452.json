Her boyfriend seems like a good person, but they are way to young to get married. My sister's brain is still developing and it's not like we are from an area where getting married young is the norm, so there isn't any outside pressure on her.\n\nI know it's not really my business, but I wanted to talk about this with her. I told her my concerns and brought up divorce statistics (people getting married this young are much more likely to divorce). \n\nI expected her to tell me how much she loves her boyfriend and she is sure they will stay together forever or some naive rose-colored thing like that, but no. She told me she doesn't care if they'll divorce. She won't put her life on hold for some statistics about other people's lives and if it turns out to be a mistake, so be it. Divorcing is easier than ever and if her marriage doesn't work out, that's okay. \n\nI was shocked. I told her it's disgusting she views marriage this way and now I'm a 100% sure she shouldn't get married. She isn't committed to her boyfriend, she wants to get married for all the wrong reasons and I'm disappointed in her as a person.\n\nShe said it's her life and I should get one of my own instead of trying to control and judge hers. I generally don't consider myself to be a judgemental person and I think everyone has the right to do how they please (as long as they are not hurting anyone else) so I really don't know.

You come off as someone it would be hard to be married to.  \n\nPeople don\u2019t delay their lives until the internet agrees that their brains are \u201cfully developed.\u201d They choose colleges, academic majors, and graduate schools, write thesis and start careers, move to new states, make friends, buy cars, make difficult medical decisions, and adopt pets.  Even if there were a magic age when brains are fully developed, people apparently make all kinds of decisions with their undeveloped brains.  Some work out, some don\u2019t.  It seems to me that my 50-60 year old friends also make both good and bad decisions.  Some are choosing second or third spouses.  Their divorce odds will be higher your sister\u2019s, but they accept the odds.  If they are making a mistake, it\u2019s theirs to make.  \n\nIt\u2019s like you wanted your sister\u2019s response to be about love and commitment so that you could accuse her of having \u201crose-colored glasses,\u201d and were disappointed she said she\u2019s okay with the odds.  She accepts there is always a risk of making a mistake and has the confidence to believe she will be okay if her marriage fails.  So now she is \u201cdisgusting.\u201d", "YTA tbh her view seems more mature than a lot of other peoples on this sub. Shes actually aware of people changing and growing, but she doesnt let it hold her back from experiencing it now.", "YTA. She didn't say she doesn't love him. You didn't go to her talking about her feelings, you went to her talking about statistics. She answered in kind. You told her a lot of people who marry young get a divorce, she simply told you she doesn't care what other people do. She's right. Why should she care about what strangers do? She feels like it's the right moment to get married to her boyfriend, that means she loves him enough to take the leap, so she's doing it. If it turns out to be the wrong decision, they will divorce. It's not nice, but it's not the end of the world either.", "YTA. You were going to discredit her response no matter what she said. If she defended her choice for the \u201cright reasons\u201d you\u2019re saying she\u2019d be naive. She\u2019s an adult, let it go.", "YTA. She seems more grown up than you. For women it is important that divorce is easy for obvious reasons. And if she does not do what she feels is right (move on with her life and take a risk), she will always regret it. Let her make her own decisions and let her learn her lessons. By the way: You are very judgemental. People who don\u2019t judge wouldn\u2019t get involved in the first place.", "YTA\n\nYou sound like a 'nice guy' but worse in brother form.\n\nAlso don't insult your sisters age, she's not a child, she's 23 and obviously more mature about the situation than you are. You said what you wanted to say now sit down and let her live her life.", "Sorry, but I must have missed the part where you explained why this was any of your business. Why exactly do you think your personal opinions on marriage should apply to your sister?\n\nYour sister\u2019s approach is a very practical one, albeit not traditionally romantic. She loves her partner and wants to make a commitment, but is aware it may not be forever and is at peace with that. Above all else, her reasons are her reasons. The only people they should matter to are her and her partner.\n\nYTA, apologize and try to understand that people are allowed to make decisions differently than you would. It doesn\u2019t make them wrong.", "YTA. You didn't ask her about love. You went in with divorce statistics and that is what she responded to.", "YTA. \n\nWhile I don't entirely agree with your sister's rationale here, in a way I also respect that she's taking a more pragmatic stance on marriage - not to mention, what else is she supposed to respond with here when you directly brought up the divorce statistics? \n\nSeriously, what could she have possibly said that would've made you agree with her choice? It sounds like nothing, really - you dismissed the reaction you expected her to have as \"na\u00efve\" and \"rose-colored\", yet you also find her real reaction \"disgusting\". So what did you expect? \n\nYou were out of line and should apologize. If you are unable to do that, you should at least keep your mouth shut from here on out.", "INFO: What \"wrong\" reasons did she give? You just told us she doesn't care if it doesn't work out because divorce is an easy process. While that sounds uncaring, it's practical. I interpret it as \"I love him and I hope we'll spend the rest of our lives together but if it doesn't work out it's easy to get divorced so it's not such a big deal to wait when we think it's right for us now.\" But with you mentioning marrying him for the wrong reasons, I'm assuming she said other things to you?", "INFO:  \nWhat are all her wrong reasons for getting married? How do you know she isnt committed?\n\n>She isn't committed to her boyfriend, she wants to get married for all the wrong reasons and I'm disappointed in her as a person.\n\nHer opinions about not caring if they'll divorce, that divorce easier than ever and that it's ok if it doesn't work out, is a direct response to you bringing up divorce statistics. And it has nothing to do with how she feels about her boyfriend.", "YTA I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re single as well. Stop projecting your views of marriage onto her. And \u201cmy sister\u2019s brain is still developing\u201d is kind of a ridiculous thing to say about a 23 yr old.", "YTA - shes not too young to get married. And it\u2019s not up to you to police her life", "YTA! \n\nAnd sometimes marrying young does work. My parents married at 20. And it lasted until mom passed away at 72. So just be happy dor her. \n\nI\u2019m also glad your sister is not going to trap herself into an unhappy marriage for some silly tradition.\n\nGood for her.", "A nice straightforward -- YTA. \n\nYou have a very rigid definition for what marriage is and how life should be lived. And the reason you're so passionate about this because you ARE judgemental -- at least when it comes to other people's marriages. If you weren't, you'd live and let live. This doesn't affect you in any way, so why do you care so much?", "How old are you? \n\n\n\nYTA\n\n\nHaving a realistic view on life does not mean she does not love her bf or doesn't care. You are extremly judgemental here. Divorce is not an option is something people absolutly can decide for themselves but it doesn't meant that people who would divorce don't love their partner. \n\n\n\n\"For all the wrong reasons\" you don't mention one reason. \n\n\nHonestly, you probably permantly damaged your relationship to your sister and as you seem to truely believe what you told her it is probably for the best.", "YTA \n\nYour sister was telling you in her own way to mind your own business. For someone who claims to not judge other people, you are quite judgmental. I\u2019m laughing at your astonishment that she didn\u2019t agree with you immediately and wholeheartedly.", "YTA- it\u2019s not your life, you are very condescending and judgemental. I wouldn\u2019t listen to you either and my brain is \u201c fully developed \u201c", "YTA mostly just for calling it 'disgusting'. It's fine to have your opinion and fine to express your concerns to someone you love. Sometimes, that's vital - when somebody is in a dangerous situation and needs someone they trust to help them out. But this isn't that situation. \n\nShe's made it clear what her perspective is and you should accept that because, like you said, as long as it isn't hurting anyone then it's fine. Calling it disgusting is a little overboard; you should make it clear to her that you are happy that she's happy even if you don't fully understand her perspective. Marriage means different things to different people and you shouldn't expect everyone to align with your views. It was fine to let her know you're unsure about the decision because honesty between people who love each other is a good thing, but you've said your part now and you should leave it alone now and be happy for your loved one.", "YTA and stay in your lane. Typically, offering unsolicited advice to an ADULT make YTA.", "YTA\n\nYour sister already said everything that needs to be said, and she seems like a way more mature person than you.", "INFO: Who asked?", "YTA\n\nShe loves him enough to want to marry him\n\nShe\u2019s also smart enough understand that marriage does not mean a life sentence in case the relationship doesn\u2019t work out. She\u2019s not going to stay with someone if the relationship sours or he does something unredeemable. She CAN divorce him, and he can divorce her. Welcome to free will! \n\nShe sounds very logical about this. \n\nLeave her alone", "YTA\nYou state it yourself, it's not your business, easy as that.", "YTA", "Yta let her live. 23 is not THAT young.", "Yeah, YTA. The only one who gets to judge her views on marriage are her and the guy she's marrying. Honestly, people who go into marriage 100% sure that it will last until the day they die may not be \"disgusting\" but they are much more delusional and apt to be disappointed than your sister.", "While I can\u2019t say I personally agree with her viewpoints on marrige, I\u2019ll admit that she loves him enough to want to marry him and that this is nobody\u2019s business but hers.

They are both adults in what sounds like a healthy committed relationship.  Be supportive. My husband abd I got married young (and we are in a social circle where that is NOT the norm) and have outlasted many of our friends who got married later. No way of telling what\u2019s going to happen, but it sounds more like she doesn\u2019t want you dictating her life than she has a deficient view on marriage.", "YTA.\n\nThe way she and her partner conduct their relationship is between themselves and your judgmental input is irrelevant. You sound bitter from the way your view your sisters relationship and should learn how to mind your own business.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s none of your business and you deciding that she isn\u2019t committed is nonsense. Lots of people marry knowing that divorce is an option should things not work out, that doesn\u2019t mean she hopes it fails.", "YTA- 23 is on the young side but not that young.  You sound jealous of her happiness.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, 23 is pretty mature as far as brains go. What are you, a grandma?\n\nSecond, divorce is always an option. Viewing it otherwise is archaic and honestly ridiculously idealistic. People change for many reasons. Divorce IS NOT SHAMEFUL. It's a thing that happens to some people. You need to figure out why someone else's marriage bothers you so much.", "YTA for sure OP. When I married my husband I told him that I wouldn\u2019t tolerate anything in marriage that I wouldn\u2019t while dating and if something happened that would seriously make me break up with him while dating, I won\u2019t hesitate to divorce him. Like your sister said, it\u2019s easier than ever to divorce which is GREAT because it makes it easier to get out of a relationship that is no longer happy or safe. I bet you know a lot of married people who claim you just have to stick it out and things will get better. This is rarely true and mostly said by people who want to justify why they stayed with someone they would have left if possible", "YTA it's her life you said your piece she disagrees end of.", "yikes. Are you married?? If you are i feel terribly sorry for your significant other. What gives you the right to judge her?? Get a life YTA", "YTA. Seems like any answer she gives would be wrong in your eyes. If she tells you she\u2019s so in love and it\u2019s meant to be then you think she\u2019s naive and stupid. If she tells you she\u2019s going to have this experience and it may or may not end in divorce, now you\u2019re mad that she doesn\u2019t see marriage as important. Get a life", "it's almost like shes marrying for love . YTA.", "YTA.\n\nMind your business.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s her choice how she wants to live. She is an adult. Pushing your views onto her like that is judgmental, so you were being so in this story.", "YTA. You dont get to be the authority on when people marry. She isnt going to bother defending herself or her relationship against a bully like you because its none of your damn business. You already formed your opinion ages ago. Fuck off and get over it", "Yta. I'm 31 and have been with my man for 10 years. We're getting married in 2 weeks. There's always a chance for divorce. That's not something you can prevent. We held off for so long because of being scared of divorce. I'm not going to keep waiting just because it might not work out.", "YTA. You're the one that brought up divorce stats, so if anyone is cynical it's you. Sounds like she's being level headed and realistic.", "YTA.\n\nFrom what you've said, her view on marriage seems extremely healthy.", "YTA. You voiced your concerns and shit them down. It doesn\u2019t sound like there is any abuse or other issues. She\u2019s not disgusting, just realistic. If you avoid every commitment because it MIGHT end in divorce, no one would get married. \n\nShe loves this man enough to take that risk. Leave her alone. You ARE judgmental.", "YTA\n\nYou gave your opinion but your sister doesn't have to listen to it.  She's right it's her life and if she doesn't care if she ends up divorced it's on her.", "YTA. It\u2019s her life, her choice, her mistake and her consequence. It\u2019s hypocritical to judge her on her life. \n\nThey may make it. They may not. You don\u2019t know.

How old does someone need to be to get married? If you are worried about her getting a divorce then get her some marriage classes. Or read some books with her.", "YTA, it sounds like she understands the risks of her actions and also understands what may happen if she is in fact making a mistake. Even if it is a mistake, it's hers to make.", "YTA 23 isn't too young to get married, and she sounds very smart, realistic and well-grounded in reality.\n\nYou on the other hand...

Get your own life.", "YTA. It\u2019s okay that she views marriage differently than you do. \n\nThere are immediate benefits to marriage (health insurance, tax benefits), and if your sister & her fianc\u00e9 want those benefits now, then they have every right to get married, even if it isn\u2019t forever.", "YTA and I wouldn't expect an invite lol", "YTA purely because she is 110% correct - it's her life, her choice, her wish to get married. Divorce IS an option! Marriage, to many of us, is an archaic institution whose only benefits are tax/legal based. I say this as someone who IS married and who didn't get married until my early 30s, so apparently I did it correctly according to YOU. But I don't care what's correct according to YOUR view, and neither does your sister. Which is how it should be. \n\nYou even say you expected her to say some \"na\u00efve rose-colored thing\" but she didn't and she's being practical, so could she have ever won this particularly dumb argument with you?

It\u2019s not your business and it sounds like your sister had this response ready and waiting knowing you would try to butt in with unsolicited advice again.

I don't think she was trying to say she's not committed. She's just being realistic that there's a chance in the future. She's right in that those statistics apply to *other people* and there's always another side to them. Divorce, while it sucks, should not be feared.

He's the only one who sees me at my best and worst, and helps me with both to be the best person I can be.\n          You don't see every side of your sister's relationship. You only know one facet of her life with her fiance and I guarantee you, you know nothing. Even if down the road they do get divorced, it's not your business anyway. Her relationship has nothing to do with you. In all honesty, her answer sounds like it was meant to upset you for bothering her with your BS in the first place. She's not immature for having a different opinion on marriage than you do. Mind your business and leave her alone", "YTA big time. It's none of your fucking business.

I was married at 23 and my husband was also 23, it\u2019s not an unreasonable age at all. Both of our grandparents were high school sweet hearts, and stayed married until death and were very happy.

Her boyfriend seems like a good person, but they are way to young to get married. My sister's brain is still developing and it's not like we are from an area where getting married young is the norm, so there isn't any outside pressure on her.\n\nI know it's not really my business, but I wanted to talk about this with her. I told her my concerns and brought up divorce statistics (people getting married this young are much more likely to divorce). \n\nI expected her to tell me how much she loves her boyfriend and she is sure they will stay together forever or some naive rose-colored thing like that, but no. She told me she doesn't care if they'll divorce. She won't put her life on hold for some statistics about other people's lives and if it turns out to be a mistake, so be it. Divorcing is easier than ever and if her marriage doesn't work out, that's okay. \n\nI was shocked. I told her it's disgusting she views marriage this way and now I'm a 100% sure she shouldn't get married. She isn't committed to her boyfriend, she wants to get married for all the wrong reasons and I'm disappointed in her as a person.\n\nShe said it's her life and I should get one of my own instead of trying to control and judge hers. I generally don't consider myself to be a judgemental person and I think everyone has the right to do how they please (as long as they are not hurting anyone else) so I really don't know.

Marriage means different things to different people, and always has. Your sister is an adult and you're apparently not going to control her worldview.

Healthcare/insurance, income requirements for rent, tax benefits all come into play.\n\nI hope my partner and I last forever, but we both come from families of lots of divorce and age wasn\u2019t a factor.

The statistics you brought up aren't very meaningful and she has a point about not putting her life on hold out of fear of some statistics. The statistics are what they are, maybe she'll be part of them, maybe not. \n\nStatistics can say a lot of things but they're descriptive, not perscriptive. Younger couples being more likely to get divorced (what, per annum or over the entire length of the marriage?) might well be true but does not really mean anything for each specific young married couple.\n\nShe *is* committed to her fiance; hence why she wants to marry him.

We both always said that we'd never remarry or date after each other and we were very young. \n\nI'm very upfront with my husband, we both understand people grow, and while we don't want to divorce if things happen and we just can't be together anymore and make each other happy, so be it.

She gives you a fairly pragmatic answer and you think it's \"disgusting\"\n\nSounds to me like you just don't want your sister to get married. Not going to pry too deeply into why that might be, but I think you need to learn that your sister does not owe her life to you. You don't get a say in what she does, what risks she decides to take and what potential mistakes she may make.

She is right, getting divorced is easier than ever- and is NOT a shameful thing.", "YTA. \n\nJust because your sister has different thoughts on marriage doesn't make them wrong. People are allowed to have their own opinions. Just like you. Also cut the crap with that \"her brain isn't developed\" shit.
