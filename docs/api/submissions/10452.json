Her boyfriend seems like a good person, but they are way to young to get married. My sister's brain is still developing and it's not like we are from an area where getting married young is the norm, so there isn't any outside pressure on her.\n\nI know it's not really my business, but I wanted to talk about this with her. I told her my concerns and brought up divorce statistics (people getting married this young are much more likely to divorce). \n\nI expected her to tell me how much she loves her boyfriend and she is sure they will stay together forever or some naive rose-colored thing like that, but no. She told me she doesn't care if they'll divorce. She won't put her life on hold for some statistics about other people's lives and if it turns out to be a mistake, so be it. Divorcing is easier than ever and if her marriage doesn't work out, that's okay. \n\nI was shocked. I told her it's disgusting she views marriage this way and now I'm a 100% sure she shouldn't get married. She isn't committed to her boyfriend, she wants to get married for all the wrong reasons and I'm disappointed in her as a person.\n\nShe said it's her life and I should get one of my own instead of trying to control and judge hers. I generally don't consider myself to be a judgemental person and I think everyone has the right to do how they please (as long as they are not hurting anyone else) so I really don't know.

You come off as someone it would be hard to be married to.  \n\nPeople don\u2019t delay their lives until the internet agrees that their brains are \u201cfully developed.\u201d They choose colleges, academic majors, and graduate schools, write thesis and start careers, move to new states, make friends, buy cars, make difficult medical decisions, and adopt pets.  Even if there were a magic age when brains are fully developed, people apparently make all kinds of decisions with their undeveloped brains.  Some work out, some don\u2019t.  It seems to me that my 50-60 year old friends also make both good and bad decisions.  Some are choosing second or third spouses.  Their divorce odds will be higher your sister\u2019s, but they accept the odds.  If they are making a mistake, it\u2019s theirs to make.  \n\nIt\u2019s like you wanted your sister\u2019s response to be about love and commitment so that you could accuse her of having \u201crose-colored glasses,\u201d and were disappointed she said she\u2019s okay with the odds.  She accepts there is always a risk of making a mistake and has the confidence to believe she will be okay if her marriage fails.  So now she is \u201cdisgusting.\u201d", "YTA tbh her view seems more mature than a lot of other peoples on this sub. Shes actually aware of people changing and growing, but she doesnt let it hold her back from experiencing it now.", "YTA. She didn't say she doesn't love him. You didn't go to her talking about her feelings, you went to her talking about statistics. She answered in kind. You told her a lot of people who marry young get a divorce, she simply told you she doesn't care what other people do. She's right. Why should she care about what strangers do? She feels like it's the right moment to get married to her boyfriend, that means she loves him enough to take the leap, so she's doing it. If it turns out to be the wrong decision, they will divorce. It's not nice, but it's not the end of the world either.", "YTA. You were going to discredit her response no matter what she said. If she defended her choice for the \u201cright reasons\u201d you\u2019re saying she\u2019d be naive. She\u2019s an adult, let it go.", "YTA. She seems more grown up than you. For women it is important that divorce is easy for obvious reasons. And if she does not do what she feels is right (move on with her life and take a risk), she will always regret it. Let her make her own decisions and let her learn her lessons. By the way: You are very judgemental. People who don\u2019t judge wouldn\u2019t get involved in the first place.", "YTA\n\nYou sound like a 'nice guy' but worse in brother form.\n\nAlso don't insult your sisters age, she's not a child, she's 23 and obviously more mature about the situation than you are. You said what you wanted to say now sit down and let her live her life.", "Sorry, but I must have missed the part where you explained why this was any of your business. Why exactly do you think your personal opinions on marriage should apply to your sister?\n\nYour sister\u2019s approach is a very practical one, albeit not traditionally romantic. She loves her partner and wants to make a commitment, but is aware it may not be forever and is at peace with that. Above all else, her reasons are her reasons. The only people they should matter to are her and her partner.\n\nYTA, apologize and try to understand that people are allowed to make decisions differently than you would. It doesn\u2019t make them wrong.", "YTA. You didn't ask her about love. You went in with divorce statistics and that is what she responded to.", "YTA. \n\nWhile I don't entirely agree with your sister's rationale here, in a way I also respect that she's taking a more pragmatic stance on marriage - not to mention, what else is she supposed to respond with here when you directly brought up the divorce statistics? \n\nSeriously, what could she have possibly said that would've made you agree with her choice? It sounds like nothing, really - you dismissed the reaction you expected her to have as \"na\u00efve\" and \"rose-colored\", yet you also find her real reaction \"disgusting\". So what did you expect? \n\nYou were out of line and should apologize. If you are unable to do that, you should at least keep your mouth shut from here on out.", "INFO: What \"wrong\" reasons did she give? You just told us she doesn't care if it doesn't work out because divorce is an easy process. While that sounds uncaring, it's practical. I interpret it as \"I love him and I hope we'll spend the rest of our lives together but if it doesn't work out it's easy to get divorced so it's not such a big deal to wait when we think it's right for us now.\" But with you mentioning marrying him for the wrong reasons, I'm assuming she said other things to you?", "INFO:  \nWhat are all her wrong reasons for getting married? How do you know she isnt committed?\n\n>She isn't committed to her boyfriend, she wants to get married for all the wrong reasons and I'm disappointed in her as a person.\n\nHer opinions about not caring if they'll divorce, that divorce easier than ever and that it's ok if it doesn't work out, is a direct response to you bringing up divorce statistics. And it has nothing to do with how she feels about her boyfriend.", "YTA I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re single as well. Stop projecting your views of marriage onto her. And \u201cmy sister\u2019s brain is still developing\u201d is kind of a ridiculous thing to say about a 23 yr old.", "YTA - shes not too young to get married. And it\u2019s not up to you to police her life", "YTA! \n\nAnd sometimes marrying young does work. My parents married at 20. And it lasted until mom passed away at 72. So just be happy dor her. \n\nI\u2019m also glad your sister is not going to trap herself into an unhappy marriage for some silly tradition.\n\nGood for her.", "A nice straightforward -- YTA. \n\nYou have a very rigid definition for what marriage is and how life should be lived. And the reason you're so passionate about this because you ARE judgemental -- at least when it comes to other people's marriages. If you weren't, you'd live and let live. This doesn't affect you in any way, so why do you care so much?", "How old are you? \n\n\n\nYTA\n\n\nHaving a realistic view on life does not mean she does not love her bf or doesn't care. You are extremly judgemental here. Divorce is not an option is something people absolutly can decide for themselves but it doesn't meant that people who would divorce don't love their partner. \n\n\n\n\"For all the wrong reasons\" you don't mention one reason. \n\n\nHonestly, you probably permantly damaged your relationship to your sister and as you seem to truely believe what you told her it is probably for the best.", "YTA \n\nYour sister was telling you in her own way to mind your own business. For someone who claims to not judge other people, you are quite judgmental. I\u2019m laughing at your astonishment that she didn\u2019t agree with you immediately and wholeheartedly.", "YTA- it\u2019s not your life, you are very condescending and judgemental. I wouldn\u2019t listen to you either and my brain is \u201c fully developed \u201c", "YTA mostly just for calling it 'disgusting'. It's fine to have your opinion and fine to express your concerns to someone you love. Sometimes, that's vital - when somebody is in a dangerous situation and needs someone they trust to help them out. But this isn't that situation. \n\nShe's made it clear what her perspective is and you should accept that because, like you said, as long as it isn't hurting anyone then it's fine. Calling it disgusting is a little overboard; you should make it clear to her that you are happy that she's happy even if you don't fully understand her perspective. Marriage means different things to different people and you shouldn't expect everyone to align with your views. It was fine to let her know you're unsure about the decision because honesty between people who love each other is a good thing, but you've said your part now and you should leave it alone now and be happy for your loved one.", "YTA and stay in your lane. Typically, offering unsolicited advice to an ADULT make YTA.", "YTA\n\nYour sister already said everything that needs to be said, and she seems like a way more mature person than you.", "INFO: Who asked?", "YTA\n\nShe loves him enough to want to marry him\n\nShe\u2019s also smart enough understand that marriage does not mean a life sentence in case the relationship doesn\u2019t work out. She\u2019s not going to stay with someone if the relationship sours or he does something unredeemable. She CAN divorce him, and he can divorce her. Welcome to free will! \n\nShe sounds very logical about this. \n\nLeave her alone", "YTA\nYou state it yourself, it's not your business, easy as that.", "YTA", "Yta let her live. 23 is not THAT young.", "Yeah, YTA. The only one who gets to judge her views on marriage are her and the guy she's marrying. Honestly, people who go into marriage 100% sure that it will last until the day they die may not be \"disgusting\" but they are much more delusional and apt to be disappointed than your sister.", "While I can\u2019t say I personally agree with her viewpoints on marrige, I\u2019ll admit that she loves him enough to want to marry him and that this is nobody\u2019s business but hers.

They are both adults in what sounds like a healthy committed relationship.  Be supportive. My husband abd I got married young (and we are in a social circle where that is NOT the norm) and have outlasted many of our friends who got married later. No way of telling what\u2019s going to happen, but it sounds more like she doesn\u2019t want you dictating her life than she has a deficient view on marriage.", "YTA.\n\nThe way she and her partner conduct their relationship is between themselves and your judgmental input is irrelevant. You sound bitter from the way your view your sisters relationship and should learn how to mind your own business.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s none of your business and you deciding that she isn\u2019t committed is nonsense. Lots of people marry knowing that divorce is an option should things not work out, that doesn\u2019t mean she hopes it fails.", "YTA- 23 is on the young side but not that young.  You sound jealous of her happiness.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, 23 is pretty mature as far as brains go. What are you, a grandma?\n\nSecond, divorce is always an option. Viewing it otherwise is archaic and honestly ridiculously idealistic. People change for many reasons. Divorce IS NOT SHAMEFUL. It's a thing that happens to some people. You need to figure out why someone else's marriage bothers you so much.", "YTA for sure OP. When I married my husband I told him that I wouldn\u2019t tolerate anything in marriage that I wouldn\u2019t while dating and if something happened that would seriously make me break up with him while dating, I won\u2019t hesitate to divorce him. Like your sister said, it\u2019s easier than ever to divorce which is GREAT because it makes it easier to get out of a relationship that is no longer happy or safe. I bet you know a lot of married people who claim you just have to stick it out and things will get better. This is rarely true and mostly said by people who want to justify why they stayed with someone they would have left if possible", "YTA it's her life you said your piece she disagrees end of.", "yikes. Are you married?? If you are i feel terribly sorry for your significant other. What gives you the right to judge her?? Get a life YTA", "YTA. Seems like any answer she gives would be wrong in your eyes. If she tells you she\u2019s so in love and it\u2019s meant to be then you think she\u2019s naive and stupid. If she tells you she\u2019s going to have this experience and it may or may not end in divorce, now you\u2019re mad that she doesn\u2019t see marriage as important. Get a life", "it's almost like shes marrying for love . YTA.", "YTA.\n\nMind your business.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s her choice how she wants to live. She is an adult. Pushing your views onto her like that is judgmental, so you were being so in this story.", "YTA. You dont get to be the authority on when people marry. She isnt going to bother defending herself or her relationship against a bully like you because its none of your damn business. You already formed your opinion ages ago. Fuck off and get over it", "Yta. I'm 31 and have been with my man for 10 years. We're getting married in 2 weeks. There's always a chance for divorce. That's not something you can prevent. We held off for so long because of being scared of divorce. I'm not going to keep waiting just because it might not work out.", "YTA. You're the one that brought up divorce stats, so if anyone is cynical it's you. Sounds like she's being level headed and realistic.", "YTA.\n\nFrom what you've said, her view on marriage seems extremely healthy.", "YTA. You voiced your concerns and shit them down. It doesn\u2019t sound like there is any abuse or other issues. She\u2019s not disgusting, just realistic. If you avoid every commitment because it MIGHT end in divorce, no one would get married. \n\nShe loves this man enough to take that risk. Leave her alone. You ARE judgmental.", "YTA\n\nYou gave your opinion but your sister doesn't have to listen to it.  She's right it's her life and if she doesn't care if she ends up divorced it's on her.", "YTA. It\u2019s her life, her choice, her mistake and her consequence. It\u2019s hypocritical to judge her on her life. \n\nThey may make it. They may not. You don\u2019t know. People that wait to marry sometimes divorce right away. And couple who hav been together since 13 - spend their whole lives together happily. \n\nIt\u2019s not your place.", "YTA . How old does someone need to be to get married? If you are worried about her getting a divorce then get her some marriage classes. Or read some books with her.", "YTA, it sounds like she understands the risks of her actions and also understands what may happen if she is in fact making a mistake. Even if it is a mistake, it's hers to make.", "YTA 23 isn't too young to get married, and she sounds very smart, realistic and well-grounded in reality.\n\nYou on the other hand... Sounds like your brain is the one that's still developing. \n\nMind your own goddamn business. Your sister is right. If she's making a mistake, it is her mistake to make. Not yours too prevent. Get your own life.", "YTA. It\u2019s okay that she views marriage differently than you do. \n\nThere are immediate benefits to marriage (health insurance, tax benefits), and if your sister & her fianc\u00e9 want those benefits now, then they have every right to get married, even if it isn\u2019t forever.", "YTA and I wouldn't expect an invite lol", "YTA purely because she is 110% correct - it's her life, her choice, her wish to get married. Divorce IS an option! Marriage, to many of us, is an archaic institution whose only benefits are tax/legal based. I say this as someone who IS married and who didn't get married until my early 30s, so apparently I did it correctly according to YOU. But I don't care what's correct according to YOUR view, and neither does your sister. Which is how it should be. \n\nYou even say you expected her to say some \"na\u00efve rose-colored thing\" but she didn't and she's being practical, so could she have ever won this particularly dumb argument with you?

It\u2019s not your business and it sounds like your sister had this response ready and waiting knowing you would try to butt in with unsolicited advice again.

I don't think she was trying to say she's not committed. She's just being realistic that there's a chance in the future. She's right in that those statistics apply to *other people* and there's always another side to them. Divorce, while it sucks, should not be feared.

He's the only one who sees me at my best and worst, and helps me with both to be the best person I can be.\n          You don't see every side of your sister's relationship. You only know one facet of her life with her fiance and I guarantee you, you know nothing. Even if down the road they do get divorced, it's not your business anyway. Her relationship has nothing to do with you. In all honesty, her answer sounds like it was meant to upset you for bothering her with your BS in the first place. She's not immature for having a different opinion on marriage than you do. Mind your business and leave her alone", "YTA big time. It's none of your fucking business.

I was married at 23 and my husband was also 23, it\u2019s not an unreasonable age at all. Both of our grandparents were high school sweet hearts, and stayed married until death and were very happy.

Her boyfriend seems like a good person, but they are way to young to get married. My sister's brain is still developing and it's not like we are from an area where getting married young is the norm, so there isn't any outside pressure on her.\n\nI know it's not really my business, but I wanted to talk about this with her. I told her my concerns and brought up divorce statistics (people getting married this young are much more likely to divorce). \n\nI expected her to tell me how much she loves her boyfriend and she is sure they will stay together forever or some naive rose-colored thing like that, but no. She told me she doesn't care if they'll divorce. She won't put her life on hold for some statistics about other people's lives and if it turns out to be a mistake, so be it. Divorcing is easier than ever and if her marriage doesn't work out, that's okay. \n\nI was shocked. I told her it's disgusting she views marriage this way and now I'm a 100% sure she shouldn't get married. She isn't committed to her boyfriend, she wants to get married for all the wrong reasons and I'm disappointed in her as a person.\n\nShe said it's her life and I should get one of my own instead of trying to control and judge hers. I generally don't consider myself to be a judgemental person and I think everyone has the right to do how they please (as long as they are not hurting anyone else) so I really don't know. Was I wrong to talk to her like that?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Marriage means different things to different people, and always has. Your sister is an adult and you're apparently not going to control her worldview.

Healthcare/insurance, income requirements for rent, tax benefits all come into play.\n\nI hope my partner and I last forever, but we both come from families of lots of divorce and age wasn\u2019t a factor.

The statistics you brought up aren't very meaningful and she has a point about not putting her life on hold out of fear of some statistics. The statistics are what they are, maybe she'll be part of them, maybe not. \n\nStatistics can say a lot of things but they're descriptive, not perscriptive.

Not going to pry too deeply into why that might be, but I think you need to learn that your sister does not owe her life to you.

You don't say how long they've been together either; if they've been together for years, it's quite reasonable.\n\nUnderstanding that divorce is an option if the marriage doesn't work out is a GOOD thing. I'm glad your sister doesn't see marriage as something she could never leave. Someone could be great for 20 years but eventually they evolve into a bad marriage partner, should those people not get divorced? Should we wait 20 years and a day to get married, just in case? Divorce isn't a death sentence or something.\n\nAlso, yeah, it's not your business what your sister does. She's not hurting anyone else. Leave her alone. You can have your own wedding whenever you feel is appropriate, but don't tell other people when to have theirs", "YTA? I'm not seeing what's disgusting - love is only one of the pillars of marriage and honestly longevity comes more from communication and aligned views on issues that arise in your marriage. I don't really understand why statistics on divorce should play a part of her decisions? I got married younger than her and am still married almost 20 years later - love hasn't been the biggest part of our marriage especially after kids and finances. Compassion, empathy, and  communication are more important than love - I'm also not seeing where she's not committed to her boyfriend and why not giving a fig about statistics and the possibility of divorce means she's getting married for the wrong reasons.", "Info: how long have they been dating and are there any other concerns other than their age? \u201cToo young\u201d is subjective \u2014 plenty of people have had kids by that age. Her brain is also not still developing. \n\nPending any concerning answers here, I think your sister is right. She CAN get a divorce if it doesn\u2019t work out. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not expecting or wanting one, she\u2019s just responding to your worst-case-scenario comments that she will get one if she has to.", "YTA.\n\nHer view on marriage is actually very mature and progressive. Your view on the other hand is actually the concerning one.\n\nWe\u2019re in 2023 dude, get real here and stop thinking like such a traditionalist.", "well, it sounds as though you were pretty judgmental, and she's not wrong. Statistically a lot of marriages end in divorce, but that's not necessarily a reason not to get married - people grow and change and it's probably healthier to accept that just because something doesn't last forever, doesn't means it's a failure, sometimes it just means that it has reached the end of it's natural life.\n\nWe now live in a society where people don't have to remain in  marriage that's run its course , due to financial or social pressure.\n\nIt's also worth bearing in mind that all that's changes is that these days, marriages a as likely as not to bee ended by divorce. For most of history, marriages didn't last any longer than they do now, on average, it's simply that they were much more likely to be ended by the death of one spouse , and as divorce was inaccessible but records and communications were worse, people whose marriages weren't working out could separate and start over .\n\nYour option that her views are 'disgusting' seems very extreme - what, specifically, do you think is 'disgusting' about someone recognizing that marriage doesn't come with any guarantees? It sounds as though she is getting married for there right reasons - she and her fianc\u00e9 are in love, they want to spend their lives together and they want to make public commitments to each other. The fact that she is realistic about that fact that things mat not work out that way seems like a very level headed and sensible approach. I'd take the view that it may well mean that they have a better chance of things working out than people who get married expecting a happy ever after fairy tale. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat, in your view, are the right reasons for getting married?", "YTA lol. Your sister has a realistic and mature view of marriage. \n\nI got married at 22 I\u2019m 32 now still married. Shocked tf out of a therapist when I told her basically what your sister said. \u201cIf we get divorced oh well we are going to enjoy and experience the life we want to. \n\nHonestly it just sounds like you want an excuse to shit on your sister. If she had said how much she loves her fianc\u00e9 and how he\u2019s \u201cthe one\u201d you\u2019d be judging her for being naive and stupid. You can\u2019t have it both ways lol. Stop being so concerned with your sister living her best life. Stop trying to tear her down and maybe focus on YOUR best life and maybe you won\u2019t feel the meet to be an aholeto your sister", "YTA. You\u2019re right, it\u2019s none of your business. And why should anyone *not* get married because of divorce statistics? I\u2019m not sure what you were trying to prove by presenting that information to her. She\u2019s exactly right that she shouldn\u2019t put her life on hold based on said statistics. The most solid relationships can end up in divorce, and honestly like your sister said so be it! Divorce is obviously not the goal for any couple, but it\u2019s also not the end of the world. Let her do what she wants to do! If neither of them are toxic or abusive then they seem to be doing alright.", "YTA. That\u2019s an incredibly healthy view of marriage that more people should subscribe to. It\u2019s a legal commitment to someone in that moment, if you no longer want to be legally bound to someone, then you get a divorce. It\u2019s pretty simple. \n\nYou are the one that views marriage as a life long eternal commitment instead of what it actually is, a legal document that can be revoked at any time.", "I was expecting something like, she said she wants alimony payments or a green card or something.

YTA OP.", "YTA, your sister just seems like she has a realistic view on life.\n\nIs willing to risk it and if it is a mistake she will own it. That\u2019s a better view than most people", "YTA\n\nYou wanted her to sound young and naive... and when she didn't, you STILL had a problem with her mature viewpoint? \n\n**What's really going on here?** Are you jealous? Do you have the hots for her bf? Do YOU feel pressured to couple up and get married now?\n\nYou need  to sit with yourself and identify the source of your bitterness and anger - jealousy, insecurity, you don't like her and don't want her to be happy, etc.", "YTA You don't get to decide what the 'wrong reasons' are.  Marriage is a legal contract that protects both parties especially in the event of children. If you live together and are to any degree financially dependent or even just mingling finances , or plan to start a family then entering into a marriage contract the sensible thing to do.  \n\nDivorce is simply the ending of a marriage contract.  \n\nThe romance , love and being together forever and religious aspects are all optional and not at all  legally binding.  That stuff is what YOU think a marriage should mean, it has no basis in reality.", "YTA\n\nHonestly, that's a very healthy way of looking at marriage.  Yea, it has it's benefits.  But like any relationship, it may not work.  If you look at statistics, one could easily come to the conclusion that getting married is a waste of time.  But if you look at it like your sister, it's just a chapter on our journey.  If it's good, great.  If it's not, move one and live.  \n\nI agree with your sister here.  You should get your own life and not be so judgmental about hers.", "Faaaaaaaake", "YTA, chill out", "Info: why do you keep calling her fiance her boyfriend?", "YTA. I got married at 28 with exactly the same mindset. 37 years later, still going strong.", "So you *expected* some rose colored response going into it. The fact that you still brought it up expecting that means that answer wouldn't have satisfied you. And then when she gives you a more realistic response that wasn't satisfactory either. YTA", "YTA\n\nBig time...none of your business. Besides calmly, lovingly, telling her your concerns...she acknowledged them. End of convo forever. \n\nYou will find much more enjoyment in life letting go of your judgementalism and desire to control others.", "YTA. Apparently you're the one viewing the concept of marriage with pink tinted glasses.

She's clearly not ready.", "YTA. You don't have to agree with her views, but at least she's realistic. She acknowledges that divorce is a possibility and has still decided it's worth marrying this guy. To me it doesn't sound like she plans to divorce him or loves him any less, she's just unwilling to needlessly worry about 'what ifs' when the decision is reversible if things don't work out. Better than fooling yourself into thinking marriage = eternal soulmates, or needlessly stressing for years over whether she's waited long enough to be sure he's 'the one'.", "Yta, your sisters view is actually very realistic and mature.

This is not some stranger, this is your sister. And if something were to happen, they would be on your ass about not seeing the signs/being present enough. \nWarn the boyfriend about her nonchalant attitude towards marriage since he is more likely to be the most hurt asset wise. If he informs you that he feels the same way as her, stay out of it. \nI understand wanting the marriage to work and always having divorce as a backup. But if she actually doesn\u2019t care if they get divorced, what even is the significance of marriage to her? Why is she getting married instead of simply committing to a longterm partnership with her boyfriend? She won\u2019t put her life on hold for stats that directly pertain to her but she also doesn\u2019t seem to think the union is a big deal\u2026?\nYou weren\u2019t wrong in voicing your concerns but she told you how she feels so you should stay out of it now.", "I don't understand why you feel this way. It feels like you want your sister to share your beliefs and are upset she doesn't have the same values. Her expectation of marriage is extremely healthy and likely why they'll be successful or at least not unhappy together and stuck. You haven't listed a bad view on marriage yet.

I was alone 4.5 years and reconnected with my current husband whom I would move mountains for and our relationship is very equal maybe even he does more than I actually. These things in life taught me lessons and I took away something from each instance. Your views r pretty old fashioned for today's standard. None the less they are yours and others do share your view. No matter what stand by your sister no matter what and be there n bad times. DO NOT EVER SAY \"I TOLD U SO!\" some of us make major mistakes and don't need to hear that shit. Support whether u agree or not goes a long way. More than being right!", "YTA for trying to control her. It's nice you are concerned but once you stated your opinion stay out of it. People there days have open marriages, swingers.

Stay out of it.", "this is not your business YTA", "If you wanna value marriage as something more than just a paper, sure, you are entitled to your opinion just as she is to hers.

She clearly is fine with them, why aren't you?", "YTA\n\nYour sister is much more mature than you.\n\nHer life. Not yours.", "It really depends on the dynamics of their relationship. It might be a fine view of marriage; but it also might be setting one of the partners up to get seriously screwed if things don\u2019t work out. I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from, and laws differ place to place, but in most US states, once two people are married, any possessions they gain afterwards are considered \u201cmarital assets\u201d, which both partners have equal claim to in the event of a divorce. \n\nSo consider a situation where your sister has a career and buys a house, and a couple of cars, and starts a retirement account, all while supporting her husband while he goes to university and gets a couple of degrees. If they (or in some states, even just one of them) petitions  for divorce, then they\u2019d both be entitled to half of the house, half the value of the vehicles, half of the retirement savings/investments, with no accounting for the fact that one person paid for the other\u2019s schooling. So one partner could have worked very hard, supported the other, and walks away losing half of what they\u2019ve worked for; while the other contributed very little and walks away in a much better position than they would have been otherwise. Goodness help them if the state they\u2019re in has alimony, or if they have kids because it complicates things even further. \n\nMarriage is a serious undertaking, and its dissolution is often very inequitable to one partner. You\u2019re right to caution against it.", "YTA so much so that I think I\u2019m being baited. People get married way younge than 23, this bullshit about the brain developing until 25 is everywhere on Reddit and it\u2019s such a garbage take. You don\u2019t turn 25 and suddenly change into a different person. Every decision you make before 25 isn\u2019t like muddled or invalid, it\u2019s so dumb. And really where do you get off commenting on anyone else\u2019s reasons for marriage or their relationship? Your sister was nicer than me, the second you asked why I\u2019m getting married I\u2019d have told you to mind your own goddamn business", "I'm gonna say YTA, with a qualifier. You're wrong, but it's coming from a caring place. You just need to understand some things. \n\n1. Divorce isn't a bad thing. The church made divorce a bad thing artificially to force people to have kids and increase the population. Without divorce, people had to stay in unhappy marriages even if they were being abused. In today's society, you can marry someone, then if they turn out to be a completely different person, you have a way out.\n\n2. Your sister is an adult, and 23 is not too young for marriage. When we were your sisters age, my wife was pregnant with our second child. We were married at 19 years old, and we will have been together 24 years in April. It's not about age, it's about having a level head on your shoulders, caring enough about the other person to do what you need to keep them, and keeping adequate communication.", "YTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t respect your sister, and you should keep that disrespect to yourself.", "YTA. Are you sure you aren't the mother or aunt? Your views and judgements make you sound old, but not in a good way.", "YTA. It's a very mature outlook. Her marriage isn't anyone else's. She sounds like she knows what she's getting into. Mind your own business.", "I disagree with the people saying her views on marriage are \"healthy,\" but I do think you need to be less controlling over her life. \n\nDivorce is not easy. It's physically, emotionally, and oftentimes financially draining. It can end in a better place, but it never starts there, and the process can be devastating. I don't think people should enter into a marriage with the mindset of, \"If we divorce it's fine.\" They need to be committed to each other, otherwise they could divorce over an issue or argument that a more devoted couple would be able to work through.\n\nIf divorce needs to happen, it's good to not have any stigmas associated with it. But it absolutely should not be the fallback plan. It's a last resort, not a plan B. \n\nHowever, this might be something she needs to learn by herself. You can't force someone to live how you want them to, and even if you're right and this is a bad decision, it's her bad decision to make. If a lesson needs to be learned, it won't be learned through your judgment or scrutiny. You can put voice to your concerns, but ultimately your support will help her far more than your chastisement ever could.\n\nAdditionally, maybe things will work out, and she'll never have to learn the hard way. There's absolutely no way for you to know how long a relationship will last; my in-laws got married at age 19 and are quite possibly the healthiest marriage I've ever seen. So don't think you know what's best for her.\n\nUltimately, even if marrying her fiance is a mistake, you need to let her make it. More than that, you need to support her through it, even though you disagree. Staying as you are will only push the two of you away.", "YTA from being in your sisters situation I think it\u2019s smart to go into a marriage thinking it might end in a divorce. I got engaged at 22 and married at 23 everyone said if we get married it would end in divorce and I used to say if my marriage ends in divorce it ends in divorce I least I won\u2019t spend my life wondering what would life be like if we where married and so far being married to husband definitely makes me happy and if that changes future that\u2019s ok it\u2019s not people marrying young that ruins a marriage but people being together because they fault like they had no other choice and will eventually end up hating one another.", "YTA 23 is not that young to be engaged or get married and her views on divorce is actually a very mature way of looking at things. What is she supposed to do spend years with this person before marrying them to see if they are compatible. Which doesn't always work by the way. My aunt who was in her late 30s spent 10 years with a man before she married him only to divorce 2 years later. I got married at 24 and have been with my husband 10 years married for 6 and were still fine and dandy. Unless she's specifically asking for these opinions from you butt out of her life choices", "YTA. Mind your own business, you sound more immature than her so it\u2019s laughable you\u2019re calling her too young. In the end it\u2019s her decision to make so just butt out.", "YTA, who are you to tell what\u2019s best for her? She is an adult at 23, and while the brain does finish developing in the mid 20\u2019s, the vast majority of its there. For eons people have married earlier than that, and just a couple generations ago 23 would be very late to be getting married. So stfo and let her make her own choices in life.", "YTA. What exactly is wrong with what your sister said? She is taking a mature and practical view of the possibilities of her life. The reason she didn't say, \"that won't happen because I love him too much\" is for the very reason you stated - it would be a tremendously naive statement. Just because she loves him very much, that's not a guarantee against divorce. And on the opposite side of that, just because she admits the possibility that a divorce could happen, doesn't mean that she doesn't love him very much.", "YTA. Your sister is being super realistic. It\u2019s her life. She\u2019s an adult. Divorce can and does happen at any age.

She's a grown woman now. It's time to let her make her own decisions.", "YTA. I got married at 22, it's absolutely not too early to marry. Also still together after 13+ years. You come off as judgmental and like you expect everyone to follow your view of life and what works for you.\n\nOther than that, hoping that marriage will work out but being okay with divorcing if it doesn't seems like a reasonable and healthy way to approach things. Staying together if things aren't working would be the way worse option. It's not disgusting to think like this in my opinion.", "I married and divorced young. Your sister has a naive view of divorce. My early divorce was simple as neither of us asked for support, we had no kids or real estate, and we split what few things we owned in common though a (mostly) civil discussion.

I am going to have to say YTA because 23-year-olds know all the information that you have pointed out already and it is her choice and none of your business. You made your choices as a young person.

My marriage had a bunch of statistics against it (married at 21, mixed race, married within a year of meeting, during my first tour in the military, with rather different upbringings, etc) and next month we'll hit 19 years, still very much in love and very happy.

There\u2019s just also the very down to earth perspective that you never know what life is going to bring you and that you both might grow and drastically change as people. Sometimes people grow apart, and that\u2019s okay! It doesn\u2019t mean your love was any less valid when you both felt it. It doesn\u2019t mean the years you spent together are now wasted.

But there are still trends/topics/opinions I see brought up on AITA that generally are pretty consistent across the sub - look at any post with about a couple with an age gap larger than 5 years, and most of the time you will see not a small number of comments in there calling it out, even if it's not relevant.\n\nSo given that I don't really think it's too weird to be curious/interested in a comment where it seems the opposite of what is usually believed on AITA is being upvoted.", "Those are facts. \n\nBut YTA OP.", "And 28 is when it starts deteriorating .
