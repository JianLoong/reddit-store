I have a mild needle phobia and I must have a low pain threshold and don\u2019t cope that well with pain. I cry during smear tests, stress during vaccinations and totally hyperventilate during blood tests. I once booked a bikini wax and had to abandon it. \n\nAlso I\u2019m very small and my partner is a big man. Indication is that the baby will be big, which is completely terrifying me. \n\nI can\u2019t bear the thought of the epidural needle so will have to have the pain and worry about how bad it will be and if they want to cut me. I\u2019m really scared. I feel sick at the thought of stitches. \n\nHaving to have blood tests etc as part of being pregnant has been terrible. \n\nMy BF \u201cEli\u201d (30) isn\u2019t that helpful. He didn\u2019t really want a child right now, though he did agree. He keeps either just telling me it\u2019s going to be ok, trying to change the subject or making typical male \u2018problem-solving\u2019 type suggestions, eg suggesting hypnosis or therapy to get me over the fear, which is quite patronising as if he thinks it\u2019s just fear and not pain. \n\nHis sister  \u201cKatya\u201d (32f) who is close to him has just given birth to a son. We were close before we got pregnant and then became closer.  She had been a great support to me and I\u2019ve really relied on her when I was worrying about everything and talked it through with me. \n\nWhere we\u2019ve disagreed though is she has wanted to stick her head in the sand and assume her labour would be fine, but I wanted to learn every possible detail and what can go wrong so I could be fully prepared. She thinks I can\u2019t know what will happen, so what\u2019s the point of scaring myself (and her).\nGenerally it\u2019s been good though and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d have coped without her. \n\nEli and I have just seen her. He just asked the basics about her and then cuddles the baby.  I had a million questions - I knew she\u2019d had a long painful labour and stitches. I asked her specifics about it and she kept giving vague answers and brushing me off, saying it been awful but she was now ok and didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nI was hurt because she knew how I was feeling and that this might help me and I told her this and said I wasn\u2019t being nosy but it would help me. \n\nShe snapped at me that nothing would help me, she wasn\u2019t my therapist, I was selfish and self absorbed and couldn\u2019t she just have a moment about her, she\u2019d given most of her pregnancy to my feelings! She said I should have sorted myself out before I \u2018got myself\u2019 pregnant and she felt sorry for Eli!  She then horrifically said she expected that my labour would be long and excruciating. \n\nWe obviously left then without even really getting a chance to look at the baby. Eli said she shouldn\u2019t have said what she did but maybe hormonal and I probably shouldn\u2019t have pushed her and talked again about \u2018support\u2019!\n\nI really can\u2019t believe the cruel things she said to a heavily pregnant woman but AITA?", "created_utc": 1672089720, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvx9qb/aita_for_expecting_my_friend_to_support_me_during/", "score": 1326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're treating her like a case-study. She was clear and asked you to back off. You were only concerned about yourself and clearly not there to take part in the joy of welcoming a new family member to the family, which is why she invited you in the first place. You were completely disrespectful. \n\nShe's right that you're self-absorbed. You couldn't even let that one moment be about her, you had to make it about yourself. How would you feel if others flat out ignored it when you have your baby?", "YTA- and shes right. Nothing is going to prepare you, birth is painful and traumatic. Should have thought about it before you got pregnant. Its rude to ask a million questions about this painful, vulnerable, and traumatic experience that she is still recovering from, and its not her job to coddle you", "YTA ask your doctor these questions. Stop making her pregnancy and birth about you. And why are you expecting a baby with a man who isn't fully on board?", "YTA.\n\nYou are taking out your anxieties on a new mom.  And before she was a new mom, you were already taking up her mental space and possibly her joy of anticipating her new baby with your Death Star outlook.\n\nYou should book an appointment with a therapist, preferably one who has experience with with pregnancies.  Or try a midwife, who are usually very understanding women-centric types.  Or even a Doula, who tend to know very little medically, but are primarily there for support during labor.  Sometimes even covered with insurance.\n\nSomewhere, somehow, try to learn to push out all the negatives about delivery and try to find the positive to latch onto (baby), even if it's just one thing that will help you focus on something other than your anxiety.\n\nAnd maybe try some Yoga?  Women who have experience doing yoga generally are walking into the delivery experience with a bonus mindset.", "Yep. YTA. Seriously- no regard for your sister in law right after a tough birth because YOU need reassurance. Not a thought for her.", "YTA. So you badgered your boyfriend into knocking you up, and then you tried badgering his sister (a brand new mom) into giving you her medical details, even though she made it very clear she didn't want to. Yeah, hun, you're extremely selfish. Selfish people make shit parents. You should work on that.", "YTA. She just had her baby. She was doing you a favor by being vague, and even said she didn't want to talk about it. You persisted and made it about you rather than her and her new baby. \n\nYes, she was a little mean, but she's allowed! She just went through labor and delivery!", "YTA\nShe just went through birth and you want to make her your personal birth coach. She told you she doesn't want to talk about it and you completely insensitive jerk kept pestering her.\nFun fact: trauma needs time or it can solidify. But you'd rather risk  get developing ptsd or post partum depression than for once supporting her.", "YTA, she's absolutely right. Your pregnancy anxieties should be discussed with your doctor and not dumped onto your friend. In all the times you went to her for comfort, how often did you reciprocate and ask how she was feeling?\n\nShe had *just* given birth and you only asked questions out of concern for yourself and not her!", "YTA. \n\nHer comments about wanting something to be about herself are telling.  You've admitted you've leaned on her, making her comment about her whole pregnancy being about you believeable. \n\nYou could have backed off when she gave you the vague answers.  You could have even gone as far as asking about another time in the future you might talk - but no, you had to push it right then.  The woman has just given birth.  \n\nYou overstepped. \n\nYou should apologize for being insensitive, and then you could KINDLY ask if she'd be willing to talk to you more about her experience **when it's a good time for her** and be prepared to accept if she says no then you have to deal.", ">I was hurt because she knew how I was feeling and that this might help me and I told her this and said I wasn\u2019t being nosy but it would help me.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s really shitty of you. Sure ask the question, but the second she showed she was uncomfortable talking about it you should have dropped it. You basically went, \u201ctell me about your traumatic experience and how it felt to get your vagina ripped open and sewn back together. Oh you don\u2019t want to? That\u2019s really hurtful, it would really help me a lot to hear more about your vagina.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe helped you your whole pregnancy. She told she found her labour traumatic, and then instead of offering her support, seeing if there was anything you could do for her, or comforting her, you focused on how you were still scared. The thing you are scared about your friend just experienced, and found terrible. Be a good friend.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA.  You terrorized her during her pregnancy by telling her every damn gory detail about every possible scenario.  \n\nWorse, instead of focusing on being happy about her NEWBORN baby, once again you make it all about you.\n\nShe is not your therapist and has absolutely no obligation to tell you anything about her birth.\n\nBut, let me tell you something as a mom of a toddler:  you do NOT sound ready to be a Mom.  And you are terribly short-sighted to be consumed with worry about birth.  You know what\u2019s twenty times harder?  Going without sleep for so long you literally can\u2019t think.  Constantly worrying about the baby\u2019s safety.  And for you, what sounds like a very likely possibility of raising a child alone, bc your BF doesn\u2019t sound like he cares much about you or at all for the baby.\n\nYou should be researching what you\u2019re going to do AFTER the baby is born.  You should absolutely stop harassing literally a new mom who just went through labor and who is exhausted and sleep deprived and rightfully worried about every damn thing other than you.\n\nYTA and you do not sound ready to have a child that will get a life she/he deserves.", "YTA. Birth stories are incredibly personal and she doesn\u2019t owe it to you to give you all the details so YOU could prepare for it. What if she tells you stuff and you accuse her of scaring you - something you seem very capable of actually doing. \n\n\nAnd also, being heavily pregnant is NOTHING COMPARED TO being in a postpartum having just given birth. Her feelings and emotions are just as valid if not more.", "YTA.\n\nYou pushed and pushed, then suddenly shocked when she snapped. She just gave birth, and you were there to see her kid, but had to make it about you.\n\nYour bf is right, you need to seek professional help.", "YTA.\nYou probably knew what came with pregnancy, and she told you very clearly it was an awful birth. \n\u201cI really can\u2019t believe the cruel things she said to a heavily pregnant woman\u201d\nYou grilled a woman who is freshly postpartum and actively healing, and you state you were aware that she had a painful labor that ended in stitches.\nPregnancy is intense and throws off your hormones both during and after. Do your own research, talk to older moms, and talk to your partner about how to help you during the birth. \nYou need to take responsibility for your own fears.", "YTA\n\nYour friend made her boundaries clear that she didn\u2019t want to go into detail about something that was painful for her. She tried everything she could to get you to back off and when you wouldn\u2019t, she snapped. She\u2019s been with you your whole pregnancy and likely has been as available to you as she can be given her own situation. Why was her new baby and new birth less important than your own pregnancy? \n\nBased on what you\u2019re saying about Eli and the conversations you\u2019ve had with him, I have to concur with her that you need help and more so than they can provide. It sounds like they\u2019ve been as supportive and understanding as they can be but you\u2019re finding fault in everything they do or say. The hypno therapy was a good idea and yet you made it seem demeaning. You\u2019re actively pushing people away from helping you by making them feel terrible about their suggestions and their words for trying to pacify your fears\u2026 you\u2019re still 2 months away and will need support as the day gets closer so please seek help and support to ensure you have Eli, Katya, and others in your corner! \n\nI say this as a mom of a 13mo old and who is 28wks pregnant\u2026", "YTA\n\nYou asked and pushed and got what you deserved. If you don't really want to know, don't ask. \n\nLet her have her own birth. She's right, she isn't your therapist.", "YTA. What do you even want? You say you want her to give you all the details, but at the same time it sounds like you really don\u2019t. You really just want her to tell you that it didn\u2019t hurt, that everything was a breeze, and you would get through it with no problem. Except you know already that that was not the case for her. \n\nNo wonder she is irritated.  You demanded honesty, you got it, and now you\u2019re whining that she \u201cterrified\u201d you.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you have a frank talk with your doctor? Let him or her know your concerns and guide you as a medical professional. \n\nKatya has enough going on in her life with her recovery and her newborn. Leave her alone.", "YTA : here\u2019s why\n- you are never entitled to someone\u2019s medical information. HIPAA exists for a reason. \n\n- you don\u2019t respect her boundaries. She asked you to stop bringing up her birth, and to stop bringing up certain topics with her, and you railroaded right over that. \n\n- you are letting your husband off the hook for being unsupportive and expecting a female relative to step up and take the place of your husband. He\u2019s an AH too. There are only two people responsible for this baby: you and your husband not you and sil. \n\n- you need to seek counseling for these issues. Your sil is not your counselor. \n\n- you\u2019re so self centered you\u2019ve tried to make her birth and pregnancy all about you and your pregnancy All about you. \n\n- blaming her mood on hormones. How would you feel if someone called you crazy for your phobias or how you\u2019re handling this pregnancy. You\u2019ve treated sil worse than your husbands treating you. \n\nIn conclusion: get counseling, get couples counseling, look into hiring a professional who can help you in understanding how you want to handle childbirth and to assist with what will be a very stressful time for you.\n\nEdit: of course HIPAA does not apply to sil sharing her own medical history. I meant it in the sense that medical history is protected, op is not entitled to anyones medical history. Not that HIPAA is applicable in this exact situation.", "YTA.\n\nPregnancy is known to be one of the most horrific natural pains to mankind, her recapping her experience to you is doing nothing for both yourself and her.\n\nKatya is right. Even if you were the most educated person in the world, there is very little you can do to help yourself during childbirth. \n\nYou\u2019ve made her pregnancy all about your fears, probably exacerbating hers. You tried to overtake her moments as a new mom with a baby.", "YTA\n\nAnd your sister is 100% right, you are making HER experience about YOU and that is super unfair. Honestly, idc what other comments say, you should NEVER have gotten pregnant since you aren\u2019t dealing with any of your fears correctly (ie therapy) \n\nLabor is the most painful thing a woman EVER goes through and that\u2019s never been a secret kept from women, so you reallllllly need to find something to help you cope ASAP or what will already be kind of \u201ctraumatizing\u201d will be even worse, that\u2019s just reality.", "YTA You went way too far by giving your bf\u2019s sister the third degree about her birth experience even when she made it clear that she didn\u2019t want to go into extensive detail about it right after giving birth. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe you or anyone this private information and snapped after doing everything else she could think of to stop your relentless questioning. I think saying that she wanted this moment to be about her and not you was a reality check you should have heeded. \n\nI think you should talk to your obstetrician and probably a therapist about your anxieties/phobias and how to best address them. It sounds like they are burdening you heavily and I hope you find the help you need.\n\nEdit to add: I second the suggestion that you consider getting a doula to support you during labor. I also hope you are going to birthing classes where you could get a lot of helpful info,", "YTA. Being pregnant is hard, but everything you wrote here is selfish. You are expecting this woman who has just given birth to ignore her own needs and cater to your desire to know details about the birth, just as you apparently convinced your boyfriend to ignore his desire not to have a child in favour of your wish for one.\n\nFind a therapist for your anxiety about the birth and don't expect the people around you to cater to you all the time.", "You sound pretty selfish.\n\nYour partner doesn\u2019t want a kid, but \u2018agreed\u2019.

You are letting anxiety and fear run away with you, and that is only going to complicate the entire process and make the birth more difficult. \n\nYou don't need to know all the worst things. They aren't all going to happen. Many, many things can go wrong. Most things go right, and you can't plan for any of it. You have to go in trusting yourself and your medical team.\n\nPlease tell your doctor how you are feeling and find a therapist asap to try and deal with this prior to birth. You don't need to be suffering, and you are.", "YTA. She should not have said what she said, but good GRIEF this is a woman with a newborn who is sleep-deprived and exhausted and just wants a moment of peace and calm.\n\nInstead of talking about her baby and how beautiful she is and how are mom and baby doing, you IMMEDIATELY make it all about you.

How much more \"fully prepared\" do you need to be - JFC, why do you need to hear it in person rather than read about the countless birth stories on any number of blogs.\n\nTake a number, you're one of BILLIONS.

Work on reading the room better. Maybe talk with people who've had a year to get back in their own groove after having a baby, or maybe talk to your parents. Failing that internet.\n\nAnd given the whole background issues you gave, she might be completely right in that it's things you should have looked up either before getting pregnant, or immediately after finding out you were.", "Yta - you're only thinking about yourself. She just gave birth, she needs rest and not to be badgered by you. Ask your doctor or pregnancy groups these questions. Apologize to her", "You are a very selfish person. You probably should get a therapist to help work through that, your anxiety and phobias. If you do nothing to help yourself, you will hurt your child in the long run.

She shared the details she was comfortable sharing. That's the end. Besides she is right.\n\nHorror stories won't help you, you will just become more anxious. And I say this from experience. I have a fear of needles too, but turns out I have a high pain tolerance and I had two easy vaginal births. My friend got pregnant the same year I gave birth a second time. I have rule that I do not disclose possibly scary details about giving birth to someone who has never done so. But my friend has another friend who had awful horrible births and she shared every detail with her. She was flat out terrified! So I changed my rule and told her my stories and I also told her about hypnobirthing (I highly recommend this to you, too!). It helped her and she  actually had a quick and easy labour and delivery despite being little and skinny and the baby was around 4,5 kgs. She used some tricks she learned from hypnobirthing books and also had a very supporting staff, who guided her natural delivery (no meds, free choice of delivery position, she could eat and drink, use the bathrooms, etc - these are unfortunately not common things in our country).", "Why the hell did you get pregnant if you're scared of pain? That's basically what child birth is KNOWN for, being one of the most painful things a person could go through. You really didn't think that through when you decided to have a baby, did you? \n\nDo you want her to say it was fine? That the baby just slipped out 2 minutes after labor started? That she went completely back to normal the moment it ended? That it wasn't traumatic for her? Because she never will. She told you how awful it most likely will be for you, so now you have time to prepare for it!\n\nGood luck, hope you're ok with needles or else you're not getting any pain meds. YTA.", "YTA. You tried to force her to discuss something deeply personal and possibly traumatic.

A woman doesn't have the same experience with each baby.\n\nI understand that you are fearful. I understand that your partner isn't acting the way that you want him to. In his defense, he is processing becoming a parent and the responsible too. Are you supporting each other.\n\nYour SIL just had her child.

She made it clear that she didn\u2019t want to talk in excruciating detail about the birth and yet you kept asking her questions. You disrespected her by continuing to ask about her experience when it was clear she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. She doesn\u2019t have to share her personal medical history with you. YTA.\n\nOn a side note, I agree with Eli and Katya that you should probably look into therapy or counselling. Given the level of your anxiety, you may benefit from some form of professional help.", "YTA for so many reasons. Although Katya was more harsh than needed, she is right: you should have thought about all of the pain and procedures before choosing to get pregnant. It is not her responsibility to be your guide in this process, ESPECIALLY after she just gave birth. Pregnancy is one of the most intimate and life changing experiences, one you should never push someone to talk about if they are not comfortable. You\u2019re so inconsiderate of Katya and she was rightfully frustrated. Also, Eli suggesting things like therapy is not typical male \u201cproblem-solving\u201d, you NEED therapy or some kind of professional help for how you are currently feeling and acting. There is nothing wrong in being afraid of the pain and the process of pregnancy and child birth, but you are not entitled in having others accommodate for you and give you all the information you would like about their private birthing experiences. Get over yourself and apologize to Katya", "YTA. You have pushed her through the entire pregnancy to learn stuff she didn't want to know. Your phobias, including your fear of pain, is your problem, but you keep trying to make it everyone's problem without seeking professional help dealing with it. Epidural shots don't hurt much because you get a local anesthetic or they give it in the middle of a contraction. Yes I've had one.  The stitches also have local anesthetic given and do not hurt. If your doctor has not mentioned this, ask. She is not your therapist and should not have to deal with your issues right after childbirth.", "YTA. Did you even stop to think at any point that she might not want to relive her traumatic birth *because it was traumatic?* Your anxiety does not give you the right to interrogate someone about their private medical information nor any trauma. \n\nHell, I have had friends recently give birth and it wasn\u2019t difficult or traumatic by objective standards (and their own admission), but it\u2019s still taken them a few months after birth to be able to talk about the labour and birth in detail because it was still a horrible experience for them.", "YTA. \n\nHere's the thing: every single birth is different. I've had relatively easy births; some of my friends and family members have had difficult and traumatic births. \n\nKatya might actually be dealing with PTSD from her birth. She is not your counselor and she shouldn't be.\n\nGet a therapist. Talk to your doctor about alternative forms of pain management. Read the \"What to Expect Books\". Hire a doula. There's a billion things you can do that don't involve Katya.", "YTA and it sounds like your husband is trying to help. I know sometimes when you\u2019re afraid or anxious about something you don\u2019t want people to solve you problems, you want them to listen, but in this case your anxieties and fears are affecting other people and your relationships with them. I think it\u2019s time you seek counselling to deal with your issues around pain, and apologize to Katya. Also it\u2019s probably not the best idea to pester someone into parenthood but it\u2019s too late to put that genie back in the bottle. I hope it all works out", "YTA. I'm not sure how you think grilling a woman who just gave birth to give you details about her birth for you to obsess over is a better idea than your BF's suggestion to go to therapy. Specially when it looks like you weren't really supportive of her during her pregnancy.\n\nTalk to your doctor and yes, therapy would probably help you with ways to manage your fear of pain and needles.", "YTA. Big time. This woman just had a baby, your niece or nephew, and you didn\u2019t even take a moment to meet the baby and enjoy this time to be happy for her. Instead, you kept pushing at her even when she was trying not to answer and got angry with her when she specifically told you that she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nHer very personal experience is not your business, and you don\u2019t get to force her to give you all the details to make yourself feel better. And she\u2019s probably right anyway, it\u2019s your first child and you don\u2019t want an epidural, it\u2019s probably going to be long and painful. Every woman who has ever given birth will tell you that every single time is different, even for the same woman with different pregnancies. You have no idea how painful/traumatic it could have been for her to give birth and she has no obligation to share that with you.

I have a mild needle phobia and I must have a low pain threshold and don\u2019t cope that well with pain. I cry during smear tests, stress during vaccinations and totally hyperventilate during blood tests. I once booked a bikini wax and had to abandon it. \n\nAlso I\u2019m very small and my partner is a big man. Indication is that the baby will be big, which is completely terrifying me. \n\nI can\u2019t bear the thought of the epidural needle so will have to have the pain and worry about how bad it will be and if they want to cut me. I\u2019m really scared. I feel sick at the thought of stitches. \n\nHaving to have blood tests etc as part of being pregnant has been terrible. \n\nMy BF \u201cEli\u201d (30) isn\u2019t that helpful. He didn\u2019t really want a child right now, though he did agree. He keeps either just telling me it\u2019s going to be ok, trying to change the subject or making typical male \u2018problem-solving\u2019 type suggestions, eg suggesting hypnosis or therapy to get me over the fear, which is quite patronising as if he thinks it\u2019s just fear and not pain. \n\nHis sister  \u201cKatya\u201d (32f) who is close to him has just given birth to a son. We were close before we got pregnant and then became closer.  She had been a great support to me and I\u2019ve really relied on her when I was worrying about everything and talked it through with me. \n\nWhere we\u2019ve disagreed though is she has wanted to stick her head in the sand and assume her labour would be fine, but I wanted to learn every possible detail and what can go wrong so I could be fully prepared. She thinks I can\u2019t know what will happen, so what\u2019s the point of scaring myself (and her).\nGenerally it\u2019s been good though and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d have coped without her. \n\nEli and I have just seen her. He just asked the basics about her and then cuddles the baby.  I had a million questions - I knew she\u2019d had a long painful labour and stitches. I asked her specifics about it and she kept giving vague answers and brushing me off, saying it been awful but she was now ok and didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nI was hurt because she knew how I was feeling and that this might help me and I told her this and said I wasn\u2019t being nosy but it would help me. \n\nShe snapped at me that nothing would help me, she wasn\u2019t my therapist, I was selfish and self absorbed and couldn\u2019t she just have a moment about her, she\u2019d given most of her pregnancy to my feelings! She said I should have sorted myself out before I \u2018got myself\u2019 pregnant and she felt sorry for Eli!  She then horrifically said she expected that my labour would be long and excruciating. \n\nWe obviously left then without even really getting a chance to look at the baby. Eli said she shouldn\u2019t have said what she did but maybe hormonal and I probably shouldn\u2019t have pushed her and talked again about \u2018support\u2019!\n\nI really can\u2019t believe the cruel things she said to a heavily pregnant woman but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Holding your baby is magical but the process to get them out makes horror films seem tame and this process can scar you in more ways than the physical stitches.\nI\u2019m a great believer in the idea that the reason people stick at 2 kids is that they forget how bad the first one was, have the second and vow to never do that again. I have the greatest respect for large families.\nI don\u2019t think you wanted to hear the truth, this would probably not help you get prepared.\nWhat does help though is potentially speaking to a midwife, seeing if you can visit the hospital and seeing how you can have confidence in the fact that those around you will be doing everything they can in your best interests and to give you the best care possible.

Whereas for my daughter 3 years ago she had no pain from about 2 or 3 centimeters till birth because of the epidural. Her doctor allowed the epidural during pushing.    If you have to have stitches, you are numbed and won\u2019t feel a thing.  Yes they are painful for about a week afterwards but sitz baths and certain medications help.  So get the epidural as soon as they can give it, the small needle prick will be nothing as it will be so much easier to give birth afterwards with the pain relief it gives.  Or if you have to for some reason have to have a caesarean as I did with my 2nd, the needle for the spinal again was such a small amount of pain compared to the benefit it gave of not feeling any pain at all during the caesarean.

Birth is going to be painful and no amount of therapy in the world will change that. But it can help her plan, she can learn ways to manage her anxiety and she may feel better prepared.

Giving birth is traumatic, but people have done it before and will do it again.

However, thanks to my epidural I did not feel the 2 second degree tears I got, nor the stitches after. \n\nMoreover, when you are giving birth, medical professionals prioritize the health of the mother. This means that the only person for whom the baby is first priority is YOU. You are now bringing a life into the world, a life you WANTED to create and raise.

OP also put her in a position where nothing she says is right.

But the sister also understandably doesn\u2019t want to just blatantly lie and make up a story about how it wasn\u2019t painful at all. So there\u2019s no winning for the sister here. OP will be mad at her for the truth being too scary and she\u2019ll be mad at her if she lies to her about it. The sister being vague was an attempt to resolve that issue but that\u2019s not good enough for OP.

What's with the \"male problem-solving\" comment about therapy, which would be very much helpful right now?

You seem to want someone to just magically snap their fingers and guarantee you're not going to have pain, but it's not going to work like that. You can't control the pain issue except by an epidural, but you CAN control the fear which is basically making not only yourself but, from the sound of it, everyone around you miserable.\n\nEdit: Okay, I phrased that badly, you can't just automatically \"control fear\" by deciding you're going to, but you can at least take steps to attempt to do so (possibly succeeding). And even if you're still scared yourself keep it from spilling onto everyone around you.\n\nSo if it wasn't clear, yes, YTA.

She's just been through a traumatic experience, talked about it as much as she could and you kept pushing her to relive it more, JUST after she dealt with it.\n\nBut yeah, being pregnant is going to involve a lot of things that you're scared of and don't want.

If you choose to have an epidural (highly recommend btw), you have no more than 6 pokes left and that's worst case scenario-IV, epidural, IV redo if the first one goes bad and you still need it, and 2 more pokes if you need a blood patch. The IV is the worst. The epidural you will be learned over and its a zappy sting feeling and it's over and sweet relief is shortly after. The blood patch (which isn't the only way to treat a spinal headache) is a quick blood draw from your arm and basically another epidural. Also if you need a blood patch you'll be too focused on the headache to care about anything else. Tell anyone wielding needles that you aren't good with needles and ask for the most experienced jabber. Don't be like me and let a brand new nurse try to place a radial IV (right up from the base of your thumb). You only have one choice now and that's birthing a baby. You'll survive.", "YTA. You badger people for answers and reject the answers given.\n\n1) Get therapy. \n2) Try hypnotism. It actually can help with pain.\n3) Exercise regularly to the amount recommended by your doctor. It can help control birth weight and physically prepare your body for birth. (Prenatal yoga, belly dance, etc.) It may also help you with the stress.\n\nOn top of this, it sounds like you may have forced parenthood on your partner.", "YTA be glad it wasnt someone like me answering. Id give you every horrifying detail in very graphic explanations. You'd be passed out after fainting. your husband wasn't giving \"typical male problem solving\" advice. Therapy and hypnosis can be very good for people who are stressed about subjects as you said you were about vaccinations. You decided you wanted a baby, when you, yourself said your husband didn't want one yet, so it's very understandable that he isn't all in on the idea of you hounded him about having one like you are hounding her about advice. If you weren't ready for the pain and didn't research about what pregnancy and birthing was actually like, that's all on you. I applaud her for standing up for herself after she had apparently made most of her pregnancy about you. From the sound of it, you weren't even there for the baby or her, just to get your questions answered. Take parenting classes or those what to expect when expecting books. You wanted a baby, so suck it up and deal with the consequences or you'll make everyone turn away from you and want to avoid you. You rip, tear, you have pain and cramping, bleeding, some women use the bathroom on themselves, the smell is horrible, and guess what? It's painful. Don't like pain? Don't have a baby.", "Yta. \nYou were hounding a new mom with invasive questions that she was nice enough to answer and even sugarcoat it a bit and you still feel entitled to intimate details about her private experience - from which she is still recovering. I would hve thrown you out of my house in a heartbeat", "The birth is the EASIEST part of being a parent", "YTA. You were asking her extremely personal questions. Just because you\u2019re also pregnant doesn\u2019t mean she suddenly wants to relive her medical trauma. \n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t think your bf is being helpful and supportive of you while you are pregnant with his child, why are the two of you together?", "YTA. You have to shift the lens you\u2019re looking through before you go into labor. Focus on the amazing power and ability of a woman\u2019s body. Embrace experiencing that. If you don\u2019t then you\u2019re going to make it worse. Labor isn\u2019t the time to be a wimp. Yes, it\u2019s painful. But it\u2019s pain that ends with a gift. Most women say it\u2019s a pain they forget. That\u2019s why they have more children. \n\nYou are woman, hear you roar.", "YTA. No matter how she answered you would have been upset and she didn't want to answer personal questions. Not everyone wants to go indepth into their labor and delivery, and it sounds like you have made her labor about you.", "So you deserve support but she doesn't because she had her baby first? She's possibly going through post partum and that in and of itself is tough but you just don't worry about her and how she's doing. Keep being mad that she isn't coddling you and being there for you. YTA", "YTA. This isn\u2019t her responsibility. It doesn\u2019t sound like she had an amazing birth so she maybe doesn\u2019t want to have to relive it all just yet. \n\nJust do you own research and Google stuff. That should terrify just about enough. \n\nNo 2 births are the same. Just speak with your doctor/midwife and find out the info from them.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t want to talk about it and you kept pushing her. Labor and birth can be quite different. Your stories may not be the same at all. If hearing other people\u2019s stories is helpful, watch videos and read blogs. Honestly with the anxiety piece, therapy likely would be immensely helpful. I\u2019d definitely look into it.", "Yes you\u2019re TA. She doesn\u2019t want to talk about her labor because it could have been traumatic and it\u2019s very personal. You should have known what you were getting into when you decided to have a baby. I don\u2019t see labor going well for you with how you described yourself. You\u2019re going to be in for a rude awakening", "YTA.\n\nRespect boundaries. You're not entitled to ask other people to speak of their trauma for your own benefit. You're being a pretty awful friend for hogging the spotlight of a postpartum visit.\n\nI have no idea why you decided to get pregnant without addressing with a therapist or developing a support group or google researched the hell out of how people who have your phobias or anxiety make it through pregnancy.\n\nIt's not fair to rely on people to support you through this period without trying to help yourself. Take a hospital parenting class. They go through the nitty gritty of labor and the different pain medication you can receive. You can get opiods pain management or laughing gas or a tranq depending on where you are in your labor. You might be in a place where you can opt to schedule a c-section and have you knocked out. You might go into labor and have a baby before you even realize what's happening. You might have group b strep and get an Iv or need pitocin. You should be discussing this with your obgyn/medical team and should start working on your labor plan.\n\nEither way, apologize to the new mom for barraging her with sensitive questions and not respecting her boundaries or treating her appropriately on your visit.", "YTA. You\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re not excused from basic human decency. Your friend didn\u2019t want to answer those questions, and you kept pressing, you ARE being nosy at that point. Just because you\u2019re pregnant does not mean that you\u2019re entitled to know every detail of her labor experience- it obviously sounds like it was traumatic for her, and you expected her to relive that. And if you don\u2019t want to be \u201cterrified\u201d, why were you so damn insistent on hearing what happened?! Especially when you already have a rudimentary knowledge of her experience. She wasn\u2019t going to ease your fears. Honestly, you do need therapy. You straight up said you have a \u201cmild\u201d phobia of needles, but you\u2019re hyperventilating during blood tests and refuse to get an epidural because of the spinal tap, but you have a low pain threshold and you\u2019re about to try to push a baby out of you. Yes, you need therapy to address this!!! Working on the phobia of needles can help open up more options available to you to lessen pain. So your boyfriend\u2019s suggestion of therapy is actually helpful, so I\u2019m not sure what you think he\u2019s supposed to be doing. No one here was being cruel to you.", "YTA she wasn't being vague on purpose. If you would the day after my birth I could kinda give you how I felt but by day 4? I'm sorry I can't remember the exact feeling. Except for me when I had contractions I definitely  knew it was happening they felt similar yet different than Braxton hicks.\n\nI wasn't able to have my epidural.

As for you using her for support during the pregnancy, if she was not ok \u201cbeing your therapist\u201d she should have told you way sooner in the pregnancy. Her throwing that in your face now was AHish. \nAs for your birth coming up (I\u2019m not an expert) but every birth story is different, and you might have a birth completely different then anyone you know. So just do your best, and you got this!", "YTA- the most narcissistic of AHs. You consider your partner patronizing because he suggests you deal with your fears on your own through hypnosis and therapy. The therapy isn't for the pain, it's for your ridiculous fixation on it. You apparently could not stop talking about how you felt about the pain during someone else's pregnancy and didn't bother to consider whether or not your SIL actually wanted to answer your million questions. She's not obligated to tell you anything. Especially because you're never going to be satisfied with anyone's answer.", "YTA for pressuring your partner into having a baby with you and hounding your partners sister.", "YTA why are you expecting everyone around you to be your therapist? Friends don\u2019t expect other friends to answer invasive questions when they don\u2019t want to, assuage all their fears, or comply to their every whim. You should go to therapy because you\u2019re expecting other people to do what you want for your own mental health, instead of also considering theirs.", "YTA. She said it was awful and she didn\u2019t want to talk about it, and you kept pushing for very selfish reasons. You were asking private questions about her medical experience and a very sensitive area of her body that it\u2019s none of your business to know about, and she does not have to tell you if she doesn\u2019t want to. She\u2019s also an exhausted new mother who most likely just wants to rest, rather than being interrogated. Yes, she lashed out at you and said some mean things, but it was defensive after you kept pushing her to answer your \u201cmillion questions\u201d when she had said very clearly that she did not want to talk about it. She\u2019s also not wrong - you should be asking these questions of your own medical team or a therapist or even an online group for expectant mothers, not her.\n\nBut the bit that makes you extra TA, is \u201cWe obviously left then without even really getting a chance to look at the baby\u201d. Visiting a parent after a birth should be about checking on how they are doing. You\u2019re there to be supportive friends or family, to ask how you can help make the newborn phase easier, and to give the parent some adult contact. Instead, you went in completely selfishly, with the goal of seeing the baby and mentally and emotionally draining the mother to answer all your questions. You shouldn\u2019t have gone at all if that was your mindset.\n\nBirth trauma is real. Some people have great experiences. Others have a rough birth and just want to focus on the present once their baby arrives. You DO NOT get to force them to talk about their birth just because you want to know all the details.\n\nThere are LOTS of resources you can use to find out all about different kinds of births from the first person perspective. Try searching \u201cmy birth story\u201d on YouTube. These are people who have decided they are comfortable sharing their stories, both good and bad. There are also lots of videos, blogs etc from parents, doulas, labour and delivery nurses and obgyns that could answer every question you\u2019ve ever had. Don\u2019t force a new mother who doesn\u2019t want to share to answer your questions when there are people out there who willingly share their story.", "I\u2019m sorry OP. YTA. Please seek therapy. You are about to bring a child in to the world and the last thing you should do is put your unfounded fears and worries on your child.  It doesn\u2019t matter what people tell you about their pregnancy/childbirth. Everybody and every body is different. The unknown is scary. But it\u2019s unknown and you can only deal with it as it comes. It sounds like you may have high anxiety, and really could benefit from therapy before you chase people away from you.

I'm not going to go into details but if your friend had stitches and a long labor then she went through something so traumatic that she hasn't wrapped her head around it and having you badger her in order to prepare you for your own birthing experience is not just thoughtless, but cruel. There are plenty of videos out there, plenty of forums and chat rooms of women who have gone through it, but honestly...you do not want to do that! For all your insisting that you need to know so you can prepare, you aren't preparing for anything except increasing your anxiety.

And as hard as, having hard contractions all day and night and wondering if the baby was stuck all while my SO was begging the nurse for drugs. And everything in between. It's not one size fits all and it's also not Burger King, you don't get it your way.\n\nTalk to your doctor, talk to your doctor's nurse, talk to a therapist to help with coping techniques.

The recovery was night and day.", "I was pregnant with my second, we were talking about labor with the midwife, and she asked me if I was nauseous in labor with my first.  I said no. My husband said I threw up.  A lot.  I had no memory of this!  After thinking and thinking, I can kind of sort of vaguely remember that, as if it happened to someone else.   My other three labors, were I had a doula helping, me, along with my husband, those were excellent labors and births, and I remember them!", "Not for everyone, I had 4 c-sections, and 2 vaginal deliveries, I recovered faster with the c-sections than the vaginals, and it wasn't as painful afterwards as I assumed it would be, I mean it is a major surgery, but In my experience it wasnt that bad.", "I had two c-sections. The first was a long painful recovery but my doctor told me if I had a second one it would be a piece of cake (comparatively) because the same incision site would be used and there wouldn\u2019t be the muscle damage that occurs with the first. I think the first one took about 6 weeks recovery vs about a week for the second. Plus he did a tummy tuck!", "My mom told me god made women forget what labor was like so they would opt to have a 2nd child!", "My first was 16 years ago and same. I will never, ever, allow needles near my spine again.", "I\u2019ve had two c-sections before the age of 25, and it was at least three months before I could say I was even at 75%. Of course, I understand that everyone heals differently, and quality of care also factors in (first was in a very rural hospital, the second in a slightly larger hospital). So definitely a different kind of \u201couch\u201d, but still, a pretty big ouch lol.", "I haven't had a natural birth. The c-section I had was pretty easy. The healing wasn't that bad as long as I took the Tramadol on a schedule the first few days... and I needed help getting into bed because it was too high up for me. That was the worst part", "I was in low labor for a week, so when they gave me an epidural it was nothing compared to how I'd felt all week. Then I ended up needing a c-section which was also ok bc, long week. But those 2 weeks after,  I'll just say thank God someone was around me 24 7 bc I needed help with the dumbest things.", "yeah i had a mini done because of a big-ol outside fibroid, but they didn't have to cut into my uterus for that, and it was still a big thing to recover from.  i know some moms get rips and need stitches, etc, from vaginal birth, which seems dreadful to me.\n\ni got an infection after mine and had to go back to the hospital, but in hindsight, i feel like i'm still more afraid of the pain of vaginal birth (however, i've got a\\* thing where my hoo-haa has pain issues to begin with)\n\nalso edit to add: even just the shot of an epidural.  i've had epidurals for scoliosis issues and while it stinks it's also fine.  I'd never criticize if someone wants that choice, but it is interesting that the concern of pain is the reason she's choosing to not have an epidural to me!", "My third was the only planned c-sectiin so was a spinal. The anesthesiologist was suck a jerk that if my nurse hadn't been holding arms he would have been leaving with a black eye. Never had problems with needles before that, had to have a root canal 2 years later and I had a full fledged freak out when they went to use the needle to numb me.", "Omg coughing, I almost forgot the coughing!! I legit thought my insides would come spilling out! My baby is almost 9 months old now and I still get nervous that I'll lift something and the incision will just split open! I want to start back at the gym but I'm so scared of doing planks!", "I thought mine was easy too but now everyone is reminding me how much it sucked. \n\nI had two C sections\u2014the second was a heck of a lot easier\u2014a LOT less healing time and so less painful than the first.", "YTA. Your over obsessive fear, isn\u2019t her issue & quite frankly was just exhausting to read about. I can\u2019t imagine being pregnant & hearing all that negativity my entire pregnancy non stop from you. She is not your emotional support animal. It would be emotionally taxing. Furthermore, she wanted to drop the subject & you PUSHED her. You don\u2019t care about her feelings or her. You only care about your own fears. She\u2019s right, you should have worked on this before getting pregnant (this is coming from a currently pregnant woman). The woman just gave birth & is likely exhausted & you are bombarding her non stop with questions. You should consider therapy to get over the severity of this. I too have a low pain tolerance & a needle phobia, but you need to get an actual grip. It doesn\u2019t seem like pregnancy is a good suit for you. Adoption & surrogacy are other options", "yeh million questions that won\u2019t resolve or fix anything!", "> I can't bear the thought of the epidural needle so will have to bear the pain\n\nLol. OP, you'll be offering to stick the needle in yourself when the time comes- ANYTHING to lessen the pain.", "This for sure. I wasn't even the one laying the egg but it was still somehow painful and traumatic and is one of the worst experiences of my life.", "She's going to transfer all her fear and anxiety onto the baby and it will be BAD. Every sneeze will be pneumonia, every scrape will be a broken bone, every \"I don't feel good\" will be cancer. Every tiny piece of dandruff will be lice, every bug bite scabies.\n\nI say this because my mom has these \"find the worst case for anything and immediately panic\" anxiety attacks that she's then inflicted on us our whole lives, and she did *not* have any concerns about pregnancy or childbirth. This is gonna be so much worse...", "Perfectly said", "OP doesn't really seem like she understands how to ... life. \n\nLike a toddler crying because she wanted to wear the blue shorts so she put on the blue shorts and now she's losing her shit because she can't wear the pink ones. \n\nI'm sorry, I know that was harsh, OP, but you need therapy. Now. Get help. Now. Apologize to your friend. Apologize to your partner. Ask him to go to therapy with you too.", "I fully agree that OP should apologize for her horrendous behaviour, but I think it would be a horrible idea to ask the friend for permission to grill her about her experience in the future. OP needs to just leave this woman alone and use whatever online/video/book resources are availble to her.", "Well said", "OP sounds exhausting. Reading this irritated the crap out of me. Can't imagine having to be tied to her forever via a child", "EXACTLY! My son is 4 now and I\u2019m still not over my birth story. The full birth \u201cjourney\u201d or side effects actually last a year for me. Nothing can prepare you. I like you OP read everything, on my own by the way, I didn\u2019t stalk other moms, and still never heard of what I encountered. YTA let this poor woman heal how she needs to. You can\u2019t prepare and it isn\u2019t her job to help you. You should see a therapist and your gyno to get whatever you need off your chest", "You know what I think I'm going to give op what she asked for. JUST AN FYI I COULD NOT TALK ABOUT THIS FOR ATLEAST A YEAR AFTER I GAVE BIRTH, YOU ARE A GIANT ASS FOR ASKING A FEW WEEKS POST-PARTUM.\n\nWhen I had my son, I have a larger husband as well, so knew it would be a big baby, I got an epidural. That helped so much with the contractions, no pain, only pressure, while laboring. Then we ran into a problem where any time I sat up my son's heart rate would drop, my nurse likes to labor sitting up because gravity is a wonderful thing and can help a lot. So I couldn't sit up. You know what epidural don't help, the inside of you vagina ripping apart because your baby's head is to big to make it to to the opened, where I'd been given an episiotomy to prevent as much tearing as possible. I had to actively push for 4 hours because his head was so big he didn't want to come out. I felt every single tare through my vagina, I was in excruciating pain through the entire 4 hour pushing process, I felt like I was being pulled in 2 from the inside out. I had an epidural and was still in that much pain. After he finally came, I had to lay there and feel every single stitch to fix me from the inside out. Something like 16 on the inside and another couple on the outside where my episiotomy was. I could not walk correctly for a long time. I couldn't sit. I couldn't do anything. The first time I pooped after giving birth, I thought I was dying because of the immense pain. After I was recovered, I went to get put on birth control, chose a Mirena IUD. The strings put me in terrible pain because they would brush against the scar on the inside of my vag and I eventually gave up and had to have it removed. I still had pain with intercourse 4 years later. \n\nu/Natalia-better is this what you were wanting? Because sounds like it. YTA you DO NOT GET TO INSIST ON SOMEONE ELSE TELLING YOU THEIR TRAMA. Your boyfriend's suggestion of therapy or hypnosis is not a bad one and you should seriously consider both.", "I had that same experience with friends as well. We had to stay in the hospital for a while and still people thought my baby and I were alright and it can\u2019t be that bad, it is just childbirth\u2026 \n\nNow I just tell pregnant women (also others but pregnant women are more vulnerable) that I could talk about it but they really needed to think about if they wanted to hear it since it was a traumatic experience for me, so it would not be a soothing story (and I am not going to make it a soothing story, just not going to be extra dramatic about it. The truth is already a dramatic story). And if people want a not so dramatic birth story they should go to someone who has had a better experience.", "I am always like: you can totally ask me about labour and birth, but probably never about pregnancy. Or you should be prepared to never want to be pregnant. Also I am not typical for my birth of my daughter so you can ask, I'll answer but it won't be the same for you and statistically it will be harder. Also if you ask to much  be prepared I will tell you about experiences of my friends I met though my daughter who went through he'll to give birth. Those are the majority.\n\nI hope you feel better now.", "That\u2019s exactly what the title says. Even though OP doesn\u2019t tell us what Katya said that was so terrifying", "EXACTLY.", "I don\u2019t really know what she\u2019s expecting her BF to do?? Like\u2026 he\u2019s tried reassuring her. He\u2019s tried taking her mind off things. He\u2019s tried helping her find solutions. If I were him, I\u2019d be stumped.", "And OP says all the bf's suggestions are not helpful because he either offers suggestions, changes the subject, or tells her it will be ok? What are the other options of things to say?! There's nothing else left! I gotta say all of the people I know personally who said they might not get the epidural got it anyway, keep in mind extreme amounts of pain might change your mind on how scary the needles is. Also my personal experience: get a doula.", "Not only that but her husband doesn\u2019t even want a child right now. Why on earth is this situation even happening?!?!?!", "She's going to be shocked and horrified that she had a baby and now she has a baby (whomst could have forseen???), in the same way that she is now shocked and horrified that she got pregnant and now she is pregnant.", "I have a blood clotting issue and inject myself daily with blood thinners from week 8-36...then twice daily week 36 til birth, then daily for 6 weeks after...I have literally given myself over a thousand injections over 5 pregnancies to date...fun? No...but necessary so you better believe I got over my fear of needles quickly. As you said, you take what you are given a deal.", "OP thinks she should be treated with kid gloves because she's pregnant and that her needs trump that of a woman who has just been ripped apart, flooded with hormones, and then tortured with sleep deprivation. \n\nOP is in for several rude awakenings.", "Right like...I'm having trouble understanding how OP thought giving birth would be a good idea when she already has such an intense medical phobia and inability to handle pain. You can get through birth just fine with one of those things, but not really both!", "She wanted the sister to tell her that everything would be fine and that it wouldn\u2019t even hurt as bad as getting a shot, and she wanted this lie to be the truth.", "This is baffling me entirely, because I have a very low pain tolerance and an extreme needle phobia. And both of those are exactly the reasons why I NEVER wanted to get pregnant.", "There would be a million more questions because she's trying to her friend's birth as an outlet for her over-the-top anxiety. She can never talk through it. To complain that she was \"heavily pregnant\" smacks of feeling sorry for herself because her friend was just as heavily pregnant and was being badgered. Then, the kicker: She goes to visit the baby and does nothing but stress out a tired ( and probably in pain!) new mom with endless questions to the point that they never even saw the baby. YTA.", ">you won't know until you do it\n\nI had so many lofty ideas and plans with the first... I was more realistic with the second. Both times were rough, and I don't like to go into too much detail - especially to someone who is currently pregnant with their *first*, like OP.", "I have a severe needle phobia. I\u2019ve done hypnosis and also CBT exposure therapy (a solid year of hard work). When I was pregnant with twins I avoided most of the blood work (we assumed gestational diabetes, so I went on the diabetes diet and as a high-risk pregnancy I was getting biweekly ultrasounds). I was gassed to put in the IV and then had a cesarean section under general anesthesia. That was my birth plan because they couldn\u2019t figure out how else to deal with me. Phobias are terrible and I wish them on no one.", "Why do people talk about c-sections like they\u2019re the easy option? Like what? What about major surgery is supposedly a cake walk to y\u2019all, especially when you don\u2019t even get any time to heal like with literally any other surgery of this level because you\u2019re taking care of a newborn 24/7", "\"The pain of the needle for an injection is just too extreme. I guess I have *no choice* except to spend several hours shoving an entire human being through my vagina without painkillers instead.\"", "Beaver dam", "I ended up with a c-section because kiddo didn\u2019t want to budge at all. Literally 15 minutes ago it felt like there was stretching/pulling along the scar line. Child is nearly 3.5. Yeah, if I manage to get pregnant again, I\u2019m hoping for a v-back even with the extra two weeks of pay my work gives for a c-section vs natural.", "When you\u2019re in labor a spine needle seems like a miracle from Jesus God himself. Stick 10 in, as long as it stops the pain.", "I had c-sections with all 4 of mine, but that first BM after my 3rd was the one that wrecked me- even my stomach was severely bruised. I thought the others were bad- yeesh!\n\nOP- YTA and you need to get some help before your baby comes. I understand that you are scared right now, but you are showing zero empathy for anyone- including your BFs sisters. She likely had a traumatic birth that she did not want to talk about.\n\nHowever, if you would like to talk with someone, you are more then welcome to DM me. I am more then happy to share my experiences. Though, you'd likely accuse me of terrifying you.", "I always had a small pillow on hand to squeeze against my abdomen to help with that feeling. It was also my pooping pillow. I'd take it to the bathroom to squeeze against my tummy for extra support.  Ugh, it's been nearly 11 years and it still gives me the heebie jeebies, that feeling that your innards are just going to fall out. \ud83d\ude2d"]}
