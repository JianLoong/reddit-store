I have a mild needle phobia and I must have a low pain threshold and don\u2019t cope that well with pain. I cry during smear tests, stress during vaccinations and totally hyperventilate during blood tests. I once booked a bikini wax and had to abandon it. \n\nAlso I\u2019m very small and my partner is a big man. Indication is that the baby will be big, which is completely terrifying me. \n\nI can\u2019t bear the thought of the epidural needle so will have to have the pain and worry about how bad it will be and if they want to cut me. I\u2019m really scared. I feel sick at the thought of stitches. \n\nHaving to have blood tests etc as part of being pregnant has been terrible. \n\nMy BF \u201cEli\u201d (30) isn\u2019t that helpful. He didn\u2019t really want a child right now, though he did agree. He keeps either just telling me it\u2019s going to be ok, trying to change the subject or making typical male \u2018problem-solving\u2019 type suggestions, eg suggesting hypnosis or therapy to get me over the fear, which is quite patronising as if he thinks it\u2019s just fear and not pain. \n\nHis sister  \u201cKatya\u201d (32f) who is close to him has just given birth to a son. We were close before we got pregnant and then became closer.  She had been a great support to me and I\u2019ve really relied on her when I was worrying about everything and talked it through with me. \n\nWhere we\u2019ve disagreed though is she has wanted to stick her head in the sand and assume her labour would be fine, but I wanted to learn every possible detail and what can go wrong so I could be fully prepared. She thinks I can\u2019t know what will happen, so what\u2019s the point of scaring myself (and her).\nGenerally it\u2019s been good though and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d have coped without her. \n\nEli and I have just seen her. He just asked the basics about her and then cuddles the baby.  I had a million questions - I knew she\u2019d had a long painful labour and stitches. I asked her specifics about it and she kept giving vague answers and brushing me off, saying it been awful but she was now ok and didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nI was hurt because she knew how I was feeling and that this might help me and I told her this and said I wasn\u2019t being nosy but it would help me. \n\nShe snapped at me that nothing would help me, she wasn\u2019t my therapist, I was selfish and self absorbed and couldn\u2019t she just have a moment about her, she\u2019d given most of her pregnancy to my feelings! She said I should have sorted myself out before I \u2018got myself\u2019 pregnant and she felt sorry for Eli!  She then horrifically said she expected that my labour would be long and excruciating. \n\nWe obviously left then without even really getting a chance to look at the baby. Eli said she shouldn\u2019t have said what she did but maybe hormonal and I probably shouldn\u2019t have pushed her and talked again about \u2018support\u2019!\n\nI really can\u2019t believe the cruel things she said to a heavily pregnant woman but AITA?", "created_utc": 1672089720, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvx9qb/aita_for_expecting_my_friend_to_support_me_during/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're treating her like a case-study. She was clear and asked you to back off. You were only concerned about yourself and clearly not there to take part in the joy of welcoming a new family member to the family, which is why she invited you in the first place. You were completely disrespectful. \n\nShe's right that you're self-absorbed. You couldn't even let that one moment be about her, you had to make it about yourself. How would you feel if others flat out ignored it when you have your baby?", "YTA- and shes right. Nothing is going to prepare you, birth is painful and traumatic. Should have thought about it before you got pregnant. Its rude to ask a million questions about this painful, vulnerable, and traumatic experience that she is still recovering from, and its not her job to coddle you", "YTA ask your doctor these questions. Stop making her pregnancy and birth about you. And why are you expecting a baby with a man who isn't fully on board?", "YTA.\n\nYou are taking out your anxieties on a new mom.  And before she was a new mom, you were already taking up her mental space and possibly her joy of anticipating her new baby with your Death Star outlook.\n\nYou should book an appointment with a therapist, preferably one who has experience with with pregnancies.  Or try a midwife, who are usually very understanding women-centric types.  Or even a Doula, who tend to know very little medically, but are primarily there for support during labor.  Sometimes even covered with insurance.\n\nSomewhere, somehow, try to learn to push out all the negatives about delivery and try to find the positive to latch onto (baby), even if it's just one thing that will help you focus on something other than your anxiety.\n\nAnd maybe try some Yoga?  Women who have experience doing yoga generally are walking into the delivery experience with a bonus mindset.", "Yep. YTA. Seriously- no regard for your sister in law right after a tough birth because YOU need reassurance. Not a thought for her.", "YTA. So you badgered your boyfriend into knocking you up, and then you tried badgering his sister (a brand new mom) into giving you her medical details, even though she made it very clear she didn't want to. Yeah, hun, you're extremely selfish. Selfish people make shit parents. You should work on that.", "YTA. She just had her baby. She was doing you a favor by being vague, and even said she didn't want to talk about it. You persisted and made it about you rather than her and her new baby. \n\nYes, she was a little mean, but she's allowed! She just went through labor and delivery!", "YTA\nShe just went through birth and you want to make her your personal birth coach. She told you she doesn't want to talk about it and you completely insensitive jerk kept pestering her.\nFun fact: trauma needs time or it can solidify. But you'd rather risk  get developing ptsd or post partum depression than for once supporting her.", "YTA, she's absolutely right. Your pregnancy anxieties should be discussed with your doctor and not dumped onto your friend. In all the times you went to her for comfort, how often did you reciprocate and ask how she was feeling?\n\nShe had *just* given birth and you only asked questions out of concern for yourself and not her!", "YTA. \n\nHer comments about wanting something to be about herself are telling.  You've admitted you've leaned on her, making her comment about her whole pregnancy being about you believeable. \n\nYou could have backed off when she gave you the vague answers.  You could have even gone as far as asking about another time in the future you might talk - but no, you had to push it right then.  The woman has just given birth.  \n\nYou overstepped. \n\nYou should apologize for being insensitive, and then you could KINDLY ask if she'd be willing to talk to you more about her experience **when it's a good time for her** and be prepared to accept if she says no then you have to deal.", ">I was hurt because she knew how I was feeling and that this might help me and I told her this and said I wasn\u2019t being nosy but it would help me.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s really shitty of you. Sure ask the question, but the second she showed she was uncomfortable talking about it you should have dropped it. You basically went, \u201ctell me about your traumatic experience and how it felt to get your vagina ripped open and sewn back together. Oh you don\u2019t want to? That\u2019s really hurtful, it would really help me a lot to hear more about your vagina.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe helped you your whole pregnancy. She told she found her labour traumatic, and then instead of offering her support, seeing if there was anything you could do for her, or comforting her, you focused on how you were still scared. The thing you are scared about your friend just experienced, and found terrible. Be a good friend.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA.  You terrorized her during her pregnancy by telling her every damn gory detail about every possible scenario.  \n\nWorse, instead of focusing on being happy about her NEWBORN baby, once again you make it all about you.\n\nShe is not your therapist and has absolutely no obligation to tell you anything about her birth.\n\nBut, let me tell you something as a mom of a toddler:  you do NOT sound ready to be a Mom.  And you are terribly short-sighted to be consumed with worry about birth.  You know what\u2019s twenty times harder?  Going without sleep for so long you literally can\u2019t think.  Constantly worrying about the baby\u2019s safety.  And for you, what sounds like a very likely possibility of raising a child alone, bc your BF doesn\u2019t sound like he cares much about you or at all for the baby.\n\nYou should be researching what you\u2019re going to do AFTER the baby is born.  You should absolutely stop harassing literally a new mom who just went through labor and who is exhausted and sleep deprived and rightfully worried about every damn thing other than you.\n\nYTA and you do not sound ready to have a child that will get a life she/he deserves.", "YTA. Birth stories are incredibly personal and she doesn\u2019t owe it to you to give you all the details so YOU could prepare for it. What if she tells you stuff and you accuse her of scaring you - something you seem very capable of actually doing. \n\n\nAnd also, being heavily pregnant is NOTHING COMPARED TO being in a postpartum having just given birth. Her feelings and emotions are just as valid if not more.", "YTA.\n\nYou pushed and pushed, then suddenly shocked when she snapped. She just gave birth, and you were there to see her kid, but had to make it about you.\n\nYour bf is right, you need to seek professional help.", "YTA.\nYou probably knew what came with pregnancy, and she told you very clearly it was an awful birth. \n\u201cI really can\u2019t believe the cruel things she said to a heavily pregnant woman\u201d\nYou grilled a woman who is freshly postpartum and actively healing, and you state you were aware that she had a painful labor that ended in stitches.\nPregnancy is intense and throws off your hormones both during and after. Do your own research, talk to older moms, and talk to your partner about how to help you during the birth. \nYou need to take responsibility for your own fears.", "YTA\n\nYour friend made her boundaries clear that she didn\u2019t want to go into detail about something that was painful for her. She tried everything she could to get you to back off and when you wouldn\u2019t, she snapped. She\u2019s been with you your whole pregnancy and likely has been as available to you as she can be given her own situation. Why was her new baby and new birth less important than your own pregnancy? \n\nBased on what you\u2019re saying about Eli and the conversations you\u2019ve had with him, I have to concur with her that you need help and more so than they can provide. It sounds like they\u2019ve been as supportive and understanding as they can be but you\u2019re finding fault in everything they do or say. The hypno therapy was a good idea and yet you made it seem demeaning. You\u2019re actively pushing people away from helping you by making them feel terrible about their suggestions and their words for trying to pacify your fears\u2026 you\u2019re still 2 months away and will need support as the day gets closer so please seek help and support to ensure you have Eli, Katya, and others in your corner! \n\nI say this as a mom of a 13mo old and who is 28wks pregnant\u2026", "YTA\n\nYou asked and pushed and got what you deserved. If you don't really want to know, don't ask. \n\nLet her have her own birth. She's right, she isn't your therapist.", "YTA. What do you even want? You say you want her to give you all the details, but at the same time it sounds like you really don\u2019t. You really just want her to tell you that it didn\u2019t hurt, that everything was a breeze, and you would get through it with no problem. Except you know already that that was not the case for her. \n\nNo wonder she is irritated.  You demanded honesty, you got it, and now you\u2019re whining that she \u201cterrified\u201d you.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you have a frank talk with your doctor? Let him or her know your concerns and guide you as a medical professional. \n\nKatya has enough going on in her life with her recovery and her newborn. Leave her alone.", "YTA : here\u2019s why\n- you are never entitled to someone\u2019s medical information. HIPAA exists for a reason. \n\n- you don\u2019t respect her boundaries. She asked you to stop bringing up her birth, and to stop bringing up certain topics with her, and you railroaded right over that. \n\n- you are letting your husband off the hook for being unsupportive and expecting a female relative to step up and take the place of your husband. He\u2019s an AH too. There are only two people responsible for this baby: you and your husband not you and sil. \n\n- you need to seek counseling for these issues. Your sil is not your counselor. \n\n- you\u2019re so self centered you\u2019ve tried to make her birth and pregnancy all about you and your pregnancy All about you. \n\n- blaming her mood on hormones. How would you feel if someone called you crazy for your phobias or how you\u2019re handling this pregnancy. You\u2019ve treated sil worse than your husbands treating you. \n\nIn conclusion: get counseling, get couples counseling, look into hiring a professional who can help you in understanding how you want to handle childbirth and to assist with what will be a very stressful time for you.\n\nEdit: of course HIPAA does not apply to sil sharing her own medical history. I meant it in the sense that medical history is protected, op is not entitled to anyones medical history. Not that HIPAA is applicable in this exact situation.", "YTA.\n\nPregnancy is known to be one of the most horrific natural pains to mankind, her recapping her experience to you is doing nothing for both yourself and her.\n\nKatya is right. Even if you were the most educated person in the world, there is very little you can do to help yourself during childbirth. \n\nYou\u2019ve made her pregnancy all about your fears, probably exacerbating hers. You tried to overtake her moments as a new mom with a baby.", "YTA\n\nAnd your sister is 100% right, you are making HER experience about YOU and that is super unfair. Honestly, idc what other comments say, you should NEVER have gotten pregnant since you aren\u2019t dealing with any of your fears correctly (ie therapy) \n\nLabor is the most painful thing a woman EVER goes through and that\u2019s never been a secret kept from women, so you reallllllly need to find something to help you cope ASAP or what will already be kind of \u201ctraumatizing\u201d will be even worse, that\u2019s just reality.", "YTA You went way too far by giving your bf\u2019s sister the third degree about her birth experience even when she made it clear that she didn\u2019t want to go into extensive detail about it right after giving birth. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe you or anyone this private information and snapped after doing everything else she could think of to stop your relentless questioning. I think saying that she wanted this moment to be about her and not you was a reality check you should have heeded. \n\nI think you should talk to your obstetrician and probably a therapist about your anxieties/phobias and how to best address them. It sounds like they are burdening you heavily and I hope you find the help you need.\n\nEdit to add: I second the suggestion that you consider getting a doula to support you during labor. I also hope you are going to birthing classes where you could get a lot of helpful info,", "YTA. Being pregnant is hard, but everything you wrote here is selfish. You are expecting this woman who has just given birth to ignore her own needs and cater to your desire to know details about the birth, just as you apparently convinced your boyfriend to ignore his desire not to have a child in favour of your wish for one.\n\nFind a therapist for your anxiety about the birth and don't expect the people around you to cater to you all the time.", "You sound pretty selfish.\n\nYour partner doesn\u2019t want a kid, but \u2018agreed\u2019.

You are letting anxiety and fear run away with you, and that is only going to complicate the entire process and make the birth more difficult. \n\nYou don't need to know all the worst things. They aren't all going to happen. Many, many things can go wrong. Most things go right, and you can't plan for any of it. You have to go in trusting yourself and your medical team.\n\nPlease tell your doctor how you are feeling and find a therapist asap to try and deal with this prior to birth. You don't need to be suffering, and you are.", "YTA. She should not have said what she said, but good GRIEF this is a woman with a newborn who is sleep-deprived and exhausted and just wants a moment of peace and calm.\n\nInstead of talking about her baby and how beautiful she is and how are mom and baby doing, you IMMEDIATELY make it all about you.

How much more \"fully prepared\" do you need to be - JFC, why do you need to hear it in person rather than read about the countless birth stories on any number of blogs.\n\nTake a number, you're one of BILLIONS.

Work on reading the room better. Maybe talk with people who've had a year to get back in their own groove after having a baby, or maybe talk to your parents. Failing that internet.\n\nAnd given the whole background issues you gave, she might be completely right in that it's things you should have looked up either before getting pregnant, or immediately after finding out you were.", "Yta - you're only thinking about yourself. She just gave birth, she needs rest and not to be badgered by you. Ask your doctor or pregnancy groups these questions. Apologize to her", "You are a very selfish person. You probably should get a therapist to help work through that, your anxiety and phobias. If you do nothing to help yourself, you will hurt your child in the long run.

She shared the details she was comfortable sharing. That's the end. Besides she is right.\n\nHorror stories won't help you, you will just become more anxious. And I say this from experience. I have a fear of needles too, but turns out I have a high pain tolerance and I had two easy vaginal births. My friend got pregnant the same year I gave birth a second time. I have rule that I do not disclose possibly scary details about giving birth to someone who has never done so. But my friend has another friend who had awful horrible births and she shared every detail with her. She was flat out terrified! So I changed my rule and told her my stories and I also told her about hypnobirthing (I highly recommend this to you, too!). It helped her and she  actually had a quick and easy labour and delivery despite being little and skinny and the baby was around 4,5 kgs. She used some tricks she learned from hypnobirthing books and also had a very supporting staff, who guided her natural delivery (no meds, free choice of delivery position, she could eat and drink, use the bathrooms, etc - these are unfortunately not common things in our country).", "Why the hell did you get pregnant if you're scared of pain? That's basically what child birth is KNOWN for, being one of the most painful things a person could go through. You really didn't think that through when you decided to have a baby, did you? \n\nDo you want her to say it was fine? That the baby just slipped out 2 minutes after labor started? That she went completely back to normal the moment it ended? That it wasn't traumatic for her? Because she never will. She told you how awful it most likely will be for you, so now you have time to prepare for it!\n\nGood luck, hope you're ok with needles or else you're not getting any pain meds. YTA.", "YTA. You tried to force her to discuss something deeply personal and possibly traumatic.

A woman doesn't have the same experience with each baby.\n\nI understand that you are fearful. I understand that your partner isn't acting the way that you want him to. In his defense, he is processing becoming a parent and the responsible too. Are you supporting each other.\n\nYour SIL just had her child.

She made it clear that she didn\u2019t want to talk in excruciating detail about the birth and yet you kept asking her questions. You disrespected her by continuing to ask about her experience when it was clear she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. She doesn\u2019t have to share her personal medical history with you. YTA.\n\nOn a side note, I agree with Eli and Katya that you should probably look into therapy or counselling. Given the level of your anxiety, you may benefit from some form of professional help.", "YTA for so many reasons. Although Katya was more harsh than needed, she is right: you should have thought about all of the pain and procedures before choosing to get pregnant. It is not her responsibility to be your guide in this process, ESPECIALLY after she just gave birth. Pregnancy is one of the most intimate and life changing experiences, one you should never push someone to talk about if they are not comfortable. You\u2019re so inconsiderate of Katya and she was rightfully frustrated. Also, Eli suggesting things like therapy is not typical male \u201cproblem-solving\u201d, you NEED therapy or some kind of professional help for how you are currently feeling and acting. There is nothing wrong in being afraid of the pain and the process of pregnancy and child birth, but you are not entitled in having others accommodate for you and give you all the information you would like about their private birthing experiences. Get over yourself and apologize to Katya", "YTA. You have pushed her through the entire pregnancy to learn stuff she didn't want to know. Your phobias, including your fear of pain, is your problem, but you keep trying to make it everyone's problem without seeking professional help dealing with it. Epidural shots don't hurt much because you get a local anesthetic or they give it in the middle of a contraction. Yes I've had one.  The stitches also have local anesthetic given and do not hurt. If your doctor has not mentioned this, ask. She is not your therapist and should not have to deal with your issues right after childbirth.", "YTA. Did you even stop to think at any point that she might not want to relive her traumatic birth *because it was traumatic?* Your anxiety does not give you the right to interrogate someone about their private medical information nor any trauma. \n\nHell, I have had friends recently give birth and it wasn\u2019t difficult or traumatic by objective standards (and their own admission), but it\u2019s still taken them a few months after birth to be able to talk about the labour and birth in detail because it was still a horrible experience for them.", "YTA. \n\nHere's the thing: every single birth is different. I've had relatively easy births; some of my friends and family members have had difficult and traumatic births. \n\nKatya might actually be dealing with PTSD from her birth. She is not your counselor and she shouldn't be.\n\nGet a therapist. Talk to your doctor about alternative forms of pain management. Read the \"What to Expect Books\". Hire a doula. There's a billion things you can do that don't involve Katya.", "YTA and it sounds like your husband is trying to help. I know sometimes when you\u2019re afraid or anxious about something you don\u2019t want people to solve you problems, you want them to listen, but in this case your anxieties and fears are affecting other people and your relationships with them. I think it\u2019s time you seek counselling to deal with your issues around pain, and apologize to Katya. Also it\u2019s probably not the best idea to pester someone into parenthood but it\u2019s too late to put that genie back in the bottle. I hope it all works out", "YTA. I'm not sure how you think grilling a woman who just gave birth to give you details about her birth for you to obsess over is a better idea than your BF's suggestion to go to therapy. Specially when it looks like you weren't really supportive of her during her pregnancy.\n\nTalk to your doctor and yes, therapy would probably help you with ways to manage your fear of pain and needles.", "YTA. Big time. This woman just had a baby, your niece or nephew, and you didn\u2019t even take a moment to meet the baby and enjoy this time to be happy for her. Instead, you kept pushing at her even when she was trying not to answer and got angry with her when she specifically told you that she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nHer very personal experience is not your business, and you don\u2019t get to force her to give you all the details to make yourself feel better. And she\u2019s probably right anyway, it\u2019s your first child and you don\u2019t want an epidural, it\u2019s probably going to be long and painful. Every woman who has ever given birth will tell you that every single time is different, even for the same woman with different pregnancies. You have no idea how painful/traumatic it could have been for her to give birth and she has no obligation to share that with you.

I have a mild needle phobia and I must have a low pain threshold and don\u2019t cope that well with pain. I cry during smear tests, stress during vaccinations and totally hyperventilate during blood tests. I once booked a bikini wax and had to abandon it. \n\nAlso I\u2019m very small and my partner is a big man. Indication is that the baby will be big, which is completely terrifying me. \n\nI can\u2019t bear the thought of the epidural needle so will have to have the pain and worry about how bad it will be and if they want to cut me. I\u2019m really scared. I feel sick at the thought of stitches. \n\nHaving to have blood tests etc as part of being pregnant has been terrible. \n\nMy BF \u201cEli\u201d (30) isn\u2019t that helpful. He didn\u2019t really want a child right now, though he did agree. He keeps either just telling me it\u2019s going to be ok, trying to change the subject or making typical male \u2018problem-solving\u2019 type suggestions, eg suggesting hypnosis or therapy to get me over the fear, which is quite patronising as if he thinks it\u2019s just fear and not pain. \n\nHis sister  \u201cKatya\u201d (32f) who is close to him has just given birth to a son. We were close before we got pregnant and then became closer.  She had been a great support to me and I\u2019ve really relied on her when I was worrying about everything and talked it through with me. \n\nWhere we\u2019ve disagreed though is she has wanted to stick her head in the sand and assume her labour would be fine, but I wanted to learn every possible detail and what can go wrong so I could be fully prepared. She thinks I can\u2019t know what will happen, so what\u2019s the point of scaring myself (and her).\nGenerally it\u2019s been good though and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d have coped without her. \n\nEli and I have just seen her. He just asked the basics about her and then cuddles the baby.  I had a million questions - I knew she\u2019d had a long painful labour and stitches. I asked her specifics about it and she kept giving vague answers and brushing me off, saying it been awful but she was now ok and didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nI was hurt because she knew how I was feeling and that this might help me and I told her this and said I wasn\u2019t being nosy but it would help me. \n\nShe snapped at me that nothing would help me, she wasn\u2019t my therapist, I was selfish and self absorbed and couldn\u2019t she just have a moment about her, she\u2019d given most of her pregnancy to my feelings! She said I should have sorted myself out before I \u2018got myself\u2019 pregnant and she felt sorry for Eli!  She then horrifically said she expected that my labour would be long and excruciating. \n\nWe obviously left then without even really getting a chance to look at the baby. Eli said she shouldn\u2019t have said what she did but maybe hormonal and I probably shouldn\u2019t have pushed her and talked again about \u2018support\u2019!\n\nI really can\u2019t believe the cruel things she said to a heavily pregnant woman but AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Holding your baby is magical but the process to get them out makes horror films seem tame and this process can scar you in more ways than the physical stitches.\nI\u2019m a great believer in the idea that the reason people stick at 2 kids is that they forget how bad the first one was, have the second and vow to never do that again. I have the greatest respect for large families.\nI don\u2019t think you wanted to hear the truth, this would probably not help you get prepared.\nWhat does help though is potentially speaking to a midwife, seeing if you can visit the hospital and seeing how you can have confidence in the fact that those around you will be doing everything they can in your best interests and to give you the best care possible.

Whereas for my daughter 3 years ago she had no pain from about 2 or 3 centimeters till birth because of the epidural. Her doctor allowed the epidural during pushing.    If you have to have stitches, you are numbed and won\u2019t feel a thing.  Yes they are painful for about a week afterwards but sitz baths and certain medications help.  So get the epidural as soon as they can give it, the small needle prick will be nothing as it will be so much easier to give birth afterwards with the pain relief it gives.  Or if you have to for some reason have to have a caesarean as I did with my 2nd, the needle for the spinal again was such a small amount of pain compared to the benefit it gave of not feeling any pain at all during the caesarean.

You\u2019re strong. \n\nJust try and give her some time and I think when you\u2019re actually done giving birth you might even realize why she shut you down.", "ESH.\n\nShe told you she wasn't comfortable talking about what she had to go through, you could not care less and kept pushing.\n\nShe should have kept some of the things she said to herself... but it is hard to blame her for finally snapping out at you.", "NTA for wanting to know but YTA for pushing it. also labour really sucks and quite honestly it\u2019s a blur.

You\u2019ll be ok.", "I'm going to go against the grain with a NAH. You're scared and she is someone with fresh experience. Perhaps my vote should be E S H but I really think a tired exhausted mom is allowed to blow up sometimes and a scared soon to be mom is allowed her anxieties. It's ok to go over, and you should go over, all your worries and fears with your OB/midwife team. They're there to help you and keep you and baby safe through the entire process. Learn about vaginal birth and the different presentations and learn about c sections, scheduled and emergent. Learn about aftercare and take some courses on stress relief now rather than later.", "Sorry, YTA.\n\nI understand how scary it must be for you but when someone doesn't want to talk about their experience, you need to leave them be. \n\nMy experience was traumatic. I had family members constantly ask me about my delivery and I would repeatedly tell them it was traumatic, please don't ask me. They would still continue asking me and not respect my boundaries. Please be respectful.\n\nWith that said, if it helps you, the moment I saw my baby I was at peace. Even a week later, I was talking to my husband about getting pregnant again as early as possible because it is 100% worth it.", "For real! Everyone is different which what and how they want to share their birth story! My sister only wanted her husband in the room and hardly told me any details. My best friend however shared everything from A to Z.

I tried to just be honest, not dramatic- \"yeah it's different for everyone, hopefully won't be like this for you, but I experienced X\" and the needy friend flew off the handle that I was deliberately \"trying to scare her\" and \"being negative.\" Uh no just shit happens. I needed professional care for PTSD...you knew that...and you fucking ASKED ANYWAYS.", "Exactly and honestly her bf is not being patronising he\u2019s right she needs therapy. There\u2019s nothing that can be done about the pain except planning on an epidural but the fear could be dealt with or at least helped with that.

Google exists, don\u2019t force someone to provide answers, ffs.", "Especially she can read so many experience reports in the internet, watch videos of births, even join groups, but no she is pushing the bounderies of someone that had just a birth, is just healing and mostly stressed with the newborn and OP just cares about herself.

But I didn\u2019t have a short or particularly easy labor and to say it as you did really serves no purpose other than to heighten OPs (imo exaggerated) anxiety. \n\nJust saying. You\u2019re completely correct about your other points. And if this was your experience you\u2019re of course right to share it. But don\u2019t put out here like painful trauma is the norm.", "Exactly, for some reason OP decided to get pregnant, despite pregnancy 99% of the time being a horrible, painful experience. \n\nI don't understand what she was expecting from her partners sister \"oh yeah you'll be all good, it's a piece of cake\". Like people still die giving birth pretty regularly.", ">Should have thought about it before you got pregnant.\n\nI don't think that bit was called for. \n\nOP is honestly being pretty neurotic about this, but childbirth is scary, and I don't think we need to shame/judge her in that way to convey that her inquiries have become unreasonable.", "I can\u2019t help but wonder if it was a man who isn\u2019t fully on board with having a baby *with her* like specifically. He may be aware of her anxieties and tendencies and may be worried about how she will handle it, not so much that he doesn\u2019t want a baby. I mean, to badger a relative like this and completely dismiss the idea of therapy is pretty bad", "I'll piggyback to this comment to add another vote for therapy. It's not too late at 32 weeks. I do have some sympathy for OP because they're trying to manage some serious anxiety but YTA for the way they're going about it. Here's the thing. Birth is going to be painful and no amount of therapy in the world will change that. But it can help her plan, she can learn ways to manage her anxiety and she may feel better prepared. So yeah, she should  seek therapy instead of constant reassurance from those around her. No wonder her SIL was done.", "The doula idea is an excellent one (along with a therapist).", "I think my favorite part was when she said typical male problem solving suggestions.... And then we got to find out that it was super solid advice that totally would have helped her learn to cope with everything that is clearly going on in her head.", "This OP, plus her birthing experience will have no indication of how your birth will go. You can gather an insane amount information on giving birth and it still won\u2019t prepare you for it. \n\nWhat you need is to talk to your doctor about your fear and perhaps a therapist. Maybe consider getting a Doula for yourself so that you are guaranteed full support from someone who understands the birthing process and what you will be going through.", "IME midwives usually have shit for experience with mental health issues. The OP would be better off asking her OB for a referral to a perinatal psychiatrist. They are a new specialty but will have the most resources for someone so clearly....beyond...with anxiety.", "I\u2019m going to piggy back off this comment. Giving birth is traumatic, but people have done it before and will do it again. YTA for disrespecting your friend/SIL boundaries. \n\nAlso, you claim to want to know information without (what seems to me) any thorough research. For example - if you are uncomfortable with stitches or being cut a little bit why would you not get an epidural? I think you have so much anxiety that you should see a therapist because friend family support is not enough to help you. \n\nIf you want to hear my personal experience  (STOP READING HERE IF YOU DONT)\n\n\n- I got an epidural after 40 hours of labor (with contractions every 10 min which is not actually considered because you are actually not allowed to get one until 5cm dilated. Compared to the pain of a contraction, I did not even feel the needle of the epidural. Regardless of the epidural, you will feel the part of your labor when you are actively pushing. However, thanks to my epidural I did not feel the 2 second degree tears I got, nor the stitches after. \n\nMoreover, when you are giving birth, medical professionals prioritize the health of the mother. This means that the only person for whom the baby is first priority is YOU. You are now bringing a life into the world, a life you WANTED to create and raise. You\u2019re going to need to grow up a little bit because that life and its wellbeing is relying on you.", "If I could upvote this again I would.", "Yes. The guy didn't want a kid be 'he agreed' probably to get her to stop talking about kids. Though, why OP decided to get pregnant without first figuring out how to cope with the obvious pain that will be childbirth is beyond me. I'm guessing Katya got pregnant and OP wanted the same attention on her", "Also she was clearly looking for specific but likely untrue answers (that it won\u2019t be painful).\n\nSo it\u2019s not just that his sister is having to go into detail about it even though she\u2019s uncomfortable. OP also put her in a position where nothing she says is right. If she tells the truth in detail then OP will freak the hell out because OP is already absolutely terrified about going through pain in childbirth. But the sister also understandably doesn\u2019t want to just blatantly lie and make up a story about how it wasn\u2019t painful at all. So there\u2019s no winning for the sister here. OP will be mad at her for the truth being too scary and she\u2019ll be mad at her if she lies to her about it. The sister being vague was an attempt to resolve that issue but that\u2019s not good enough for OP. OP wants someone to tell her that childbirth isn\u2019t painful, and she wants that statement to be true. But childbirth is infamously painful.", "\"A painful labor that ends in stitches\" is something that shouldn't be expanded on by the person who suffered it. OP is a giant AH for pressing the issue, and an even bigger AH for acting so butthurt about it. \n\nI'm not sure I like where Op is headed when it's time to give birth. She needs to find a therapist fast.", "I'm not sure her boyfriend isn't trying to be supportive. He suggested therapy etc but she didn't like that suggestion. I'm thinking she might actually need therapy with fears like hers.", "Totally agreed except for the first statement- HIPAA prevents doctors and medical facilities from releasing patients' information but it has nothing to do with one person telling another person about their own medical care if they want to. SIL clearly didn't want to, but this isn't a HIPAA issue.", "HIPAA doesn't apply to a person disclosing their own medical information", "HIPAA doesn't apply to a person disclosing their own medical information", "I had 21 successful IV placements with my last pregnancy. I decided to stop counting the failed placements after the first couple weeks of having to get weekly infusions. I had a rare complication, it's not something anyone would or should expect or prepare for as part of a standard pregnancy. But you take whatever you get when you roll those dice- just like pretty much anything else in life. What I got was 4 months of spending every weekend in a cancer treatment center getting expensive infusions.\n\nHonestly something like that could be a blessing in disguise for a person like OP. Once you've faced down with death a couple times, being a bit of a pincushion gets less intimidating.", ">The first person whose partner is tall? \n\nI might be wrong because I'm not a scientist, but I thought they're was a correlation between the size of the mother and the size of the foetus (just like a plant can grow bigger in a bigger pot), and a correlation between the size of the parents at birth and the size of the baby at birth, but no direct link between the size of the father as an adult and the size of the baby.", "I have a feeling Katya has been dealing with this behavior for far too long and finally let OP hear what needed to be said.", "and if she had answered and thought she was done with it she would ask something else, then something else, something else, else....because she doesn't want answers, she wants to wallow. YTA", "\"Exactly and honestly her bf is not being patronising he\u2019s right she needs therapy.\"\n\nRight? What's with the \"male problem-solving\" comment about therapy, which would be very much helpful right now? And hell, if we're gonna go with stereotypes, I'd say it's more a female stereotype to go to therapy for everything anyhow, so can't even, like, be handwavy and dismiss something someone's saying as a stereotype without being accurate?\n\nAlso he's correct about looking for something to get you over your fear OP, since it's the fear that's crippling you right now. You seem to want someone to just magically snap their fingers and guarantee you're not going to have pain, but it's not going to work like that. You can't control the pain issue except by an epidural, but you CAN control the fear which is basically making not only yourself but, from the sound of it, everyone around you miserable.\n\nEdit: Okay, I phrased that badly, you can't just automatically \"control fear\" by deciding you're going to, but you can at least take steps to attempt to do so (possibly succeeding). And even if you're still scared yourself keep it from spilling onto everyone around you.\n\nSo if it wasn't clear, yes, YTA. I thought about E S H since she did go a bit over the top at the end, but you pushed her until she snapped from the sound of it. She's just been through a traumatic experience, talked about it as much as she could and you kept pushing her to relive it more, JUST after she dealt with it.\n\nBut yeah, being pregnant is going to involve a lot of things that you're scared of and don't want. Ideally you would have thought about whether it was worth it to you VERY carefully beforehand, mentally prepared yourself, and either not done it or decided that you would, but would be prepared, grit your teeth and just get through it for the sake of having a kid.", "Right? \n\nAlso this line \u201c I asked her specifics about it and she kept giving vague answers and brushing me off, saying it been awful but she was now ok and didn't want to talk about it.\u201d\n\nWhat part of no means no do some people not get?
