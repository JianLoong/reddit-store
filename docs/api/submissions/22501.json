Her chest has also noticeably grown. \n\nWhen we were out the other week and I noticed she didn\u2019t even touch her red bull I pulled her to the side to have a private conversation and asked her if she\u2019s pregnant. She immediately flipped out and denied it. Right after that she went home and I covered for her when the group asked me why she went home. \n\nI texted her later that same night if I overstepped and she simply replied \u201cyou literally called me fat, douchebag\u201d. I never did such a thing but I simply let her be instead of arguing.\n\nToday another friend told me she indeed is pregnant and I don\u2019t know what to make of her reaction towards me when I asked her in a 4 eye conversation.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: for those curious when I asked her I verbatim said \u201cI noticed you\u2018ve been excusing yourself pretty often lately and are avoiding some things, could it be that you are pregnant?\u201c", "created_utc": 1689621622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152b7aq/aita_for_asking_my_friend_if_shes_pregnant/", "score": 813, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bro, welcome to the most unwavering rule out there: never, ever, ever ask a woman if she\u2019s pregnant.

At least not until it's so obvious it literally can't be anything else (like 9 months pregnant, about to give birth any minute), and even then, you probably should just keep your mouth shut. \n\nMost women will keep it fairly quiet for the first trimester (12-13 weeks or so) because there's a high risk of miscarriage then.

Much like asking an older woman's age, this is one of those things that I thought everyone understood was tacky and rude and out of line, but I am seeing it more and more.

It's not your information to know or share or inquire. Just because you happen to be right about her condition, doesn't make it okay. People like privacy, especially in these situations.

Yeah, but there are other reasons for a person making those changes/bodies changing. And a woman is EXTREMELY moody/emotional/hormonal especially during the first trimester due to changing hormones.

Her reaction is wild to me, considering  she has gained weight and will continue to if she is planning on having a healthy pregnancy, and of course, SHE IS PREGNANT.

If there is a defect with the fetus or a problem with her health that makes her choose to get an abortion, having someone know she is pregnant can literally land her in prison or bleeding out in a hospital because the pregnancy can't be terminated until she is septic. Maybe that's not the case in your state, but most women I know are extremely cagey about anything related to pregnancy because of the legal and social atmosphere.

Lately I\u2019ve noticed that she stopped drinking entirely same as smoking and has stopped heavy lifting and going to the gym as regularly as she used to.\n\nOn top of that lately she\u2019ll often excuse herself to go to the toilet (presumably to throw up) and I\u2019ve noticed she got a bit thicker and watery. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m not jabbing her looks, it\u2019s just sth I\u2019ve noticed. Her chest has also noticeably grown. \n\nWhen we were out the other week and I noticed she didn\u2019t even touch her red bull I pulled her to the side to have a private conversation and asked her if she\u2019s pregnant. She immediately flipped out and denied it. Right after that she went home and I covered for her when the group asked me why she went home. \n\nI texted her later that same night if I overstepped and she simply replied \u201cyou literally called me fat, douchebag\u201d. I never did such a thing but I simply let her be instead of arguing.\n\nToday another friend told me she indeed is pregnant and I don\u2019t know what to make of her reaction towards me when I asked her in a 4 eye conversation.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
