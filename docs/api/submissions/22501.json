She immediately flipped out and denied it. Right after that she went home and I covered for her when the group asked me why she went home. \n\nI texted her later that same night if I overstepped and she simply replied \u201cyou literally called me fat, douchebag\u201d. I never did such a thing but I simply let her be instead of arguing.\n\nToday another friend told me she indeed is pregnant and I don\u2019t know what to make of her reaction towards me when I asked her in a 4 eye conversation.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: for those curious when I asked her I verbatim said \u201cI noticed you\u2018ve been excusing yourself pretty often lately and are avoiding some things, could it be that you are pregnant?\u201c", "created_utc": 1689621622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152b7aq/aita_for_asking_my_friend_if_shes_pregnant/", "score": 5114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bro, welcome to the most unwavering rule out there: never, ever, ever ask a woman if she\u2019s pregnant.

Much like asking an older woman's age, this is one of those things that I thought everyone understood was tacky and rude and out of line, but I am seeing it more and more.

It's not your information to know or share or inquire. Just because you happen to be right about her condition, doesn't make it okay. People like privacy, especially in these situations.

Yeah, but there are other reasons for a person making those changes/bodies changing. And a woman is EXTREMELY moody/emotional/hormonal especially during the first trimester due to changing hormones.

If there is a defect with the fetus or a problem with her health that makes her choose to get an abortion, having someone know she is pregnant can literally land her in prison or bleeding out in a hospital because the pregnancy can't be terminated until she is septic. Maybe that's not the case in your state, but most women I know are extremely cagey about anything related to pregnancy because of the legal and social atmosphere.

Lately I\u2019ve noticed that she stopped drinking entirely same as smoking and has stopped heavy lifting and going to the gym as regularly as she used to.\n\nOn top of that lately she\u2019ll often excuse herself to go to the toilet (presumably to throw up) and I\u2019ve noticed she got a bit thicker and watery. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m not jabbing her looks, it\u2019s just sth I\u2019ve noticed. Her chest has also noticeably grown. \n\nWhen we were out the other week and I noticed she didn\u2019t even touch her red bull I pulled her to the side to have a private conversation and asked her if she\u2019s pregnant. She immediately flipped out and denied it. Right after that she went home and I covered for her when the group asked me why she went home. \n\nI texted her later that same night if I overstepped and she simply replied \u201cyou literally called me fat, douchebag\u201d. I never did such a thing but I simply let her be instead of arguing.\n\nToday another friend told me she indeed is pregnant and I don\u2019t know what to make of her reaction towards me when I asked her in a 4 eye conversation.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Imagine reliving a really personal loss over and over again because you now have to tell all these people you told early on. And which of those people blabbed and to how many people? Who did they tell? Does everyone now know about your most intimate tragedy and private health information?\n\nWhat if you don't know whether you want to keep it? What if you don't know who the father is? What if you don't know how far along you are?", "Most women keep it quiet until they hit the 12 week mark for safety as your past the main risk of miscarriage but it can still happen just at a lower rate. Depending on her body type many women can show even on a first pregnancy quiet early.\nEven so you shouldn\u2019t say anything until she does herself.\nI\u2019m due my 4th next week and hid easy until I was past 12 weeks.

There may have been some shock or adjustment or decision making with whether to continue the pregnancy. She may have had prior miscarriages and was being cautious. Her relationship might have been rocked. Someone else near her may be infertile or had a recent miscarriage. There are any number of reasons but regardless of what they may be, for some reason she had not announced yet.

It\u2019s a well established social rule to not ask someone if they are pregnant unless you can see the baby crowning. Waiting to announce is common because of the risk of miscarriage being higher in the first trimester. It\u2019s a very personal decision. You should have given her time and not put her on the spot and expected her to say anything before she was ready. You also seem to be paying a lot of attention to her habits and figure.

A pregnant woman.", "Going with soft YTA.\n\nNever ask a woman that, regardless of intention. It seems like you were seeing signs and wanting to make sure you were coming to the right conclusion instead of worrying.\n\nHer reaction to me shows that she may be self conscious about it because of how often she goes to the gym.

If yes, it's a spoiled surprise. If no, we'll you've insulted a friend. You may have had concern about her change in habits ( though many might say less partying, caffeine, and alcohol are good changes) but none of these are major changes indicating she needs intervention.

Many, many couples don't tell anyone except maybe the Grandparents-to-Be until they've passed three months.

People think its taboo for a guy and girl to be close enough friends to ask personal thing like this, but it\u2019s not weird or stalker-ish  and you were right! Next time just ask about her health in general and let her make the choice to include you in her news. As for her reaction, she is probably emotional, hormonal, excited and scared.

If anything reading this made a different alarm bell go off for me: an eating disorder such as binge eating or bulimia. With bulimia for instance, most people think that the only purging method is vomiting. It\u2019s not always the case. Many people purge through exercise too, or just through exercise. And it sounds like your think your friend may be vomiting as well as purging through exercise, as well as calorie restricting on other things such as Red Bulls (which are loaded with calories). Still episodes of binge/overeating like this could lead to weight gain despite the counter actions the individual thinks they are taking in an attempt to control the underlying problem/emotions. Not being an expert and not knowing what exactly may actually be going on, if I noticed disordered behaviour/patterns my approach with a friend would be a broad one, because if it isn\u2019t this, at least you would still be a good friend to her. Ask her how she is, if there is anything that has been stressing her out more than usual, or if she has been particularly anxious and what she has been doing to alleviate that. Suggest healthy things she could do. Open a dialogue and let her open up to you (if she does great, if she doesn\u2019t just keep supporting her). Ask what you could do to help. Ask her what would make her feel better. Most importantly create a safe space with no judgement. Unfortunately asking her if she was pregnant would be the worst thing to say. Unsurprisingly, she read it as a judgement, which I hate to say that even in your post some of the vocabulary you use is pretty judgemental. So apologise. Maybe you can salvage your friendship. If not, I would still ask you to educate yourself, otherwise you will run the risk of sounding like an asshole even if you were trying to come from a good place.
