What happened was that on the 4th of November, my friend Dan decided to end our friendship. That wouldn't have been too bad, if only he said it to my face and not have his girlfriend text me saying he died. So for the next 4 hours I'm crying and having a mental breakdown, and at 6 in the evening, I learn that he faked it.\n\nHe said, and I quote that, \"This was a game that went too far, but I wanted to end the friendship for months.\" Apparently it was because I was too nice to his girlfriend. Anyway, I block him on social media, and his girlfriend calls me saying that we need to grow up, and that I can't be mad at him because she cut herself telling me. I proceeded to blow up and yell at her that her boyfriend is the one who needed to grow up. Now I'm getting my phone blown up by mutual friends saying I'm the bad guy in the situation because I can't be nice to another man's girlfriend.

He's right that it's a game that went too far. And it cost him your friendship. \n\nHis girlfriend and anyone else trying to convince you to \"get over it,\" isn't your friend either.", "Nta - its normal to be nice. Its not normal to fake your own death to end a friendship", "NTA. Faking his death to get out of an awkward conversation is INSANE. The girlfriend guilting you over her cutting is disgusting. You can definitely be friendly and nice with other men\u2019s girlfriends because women are just regular people and not actually possessions boyfriends can call dibs on (I\u2019m sure you already know that, just want to highlight the grossness). Ditch this whole social group\u2014you deserve better.", "And all this happened because your ex friend couldn't cope with you being decent to his gf? \n\nYour friend group sounds kinda incely. Do they treat all women badly, or only each other's gfs? Either way, NTA.", "NTA. The good maners are that you are to be nice to all the people are nice to you.he face is dead, that is a A move.", "NTA.  They sound like horrible people.  Good thing they are out of your life now.", "NTA, and I hope your mutual friends aren't anything like these two or you might be blocking a lot more people in your future.", "Block both of them and carry on with your life.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Holy Moly, what people do you know? Not being able to tell somebody you want to break up is already low, but faking your own death (being the pinnacle of spinelessnes) and then being \"called out\" for blowing up in that guy's face... wow. You need to break up with your circle of friends, I think. So no, your ex is definitely the one who needs to grow up.", "Info\nWhy is the gf texting you? He wanted you out of his life and you are out. Why is she bothered by that? \n\n\nNTA he faked his own dead...

If you really are rude to his gf then you may be an AH, the reasoning behind it may change that but not a lot. If you care about your friend then you are curteous and respectful to their s/o despite their attributes, obviously this has its limits but short of the s/o being  a total AH previously, you could easily be an AH in this aswell. Reguardless the friend and their s/o are total AH's at least starting with this incident, faking someones death is crappy, their reasoning behind it is crappy, doing it all through text is crappy, zero displayed redeming qualities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA", "Is your friend Earl J Hickey, what the hell?!\n\nNTA, of course.", "NTA\u2026so let me get this straight. He pulled an incredibly dumb \u2018prank\u2019 because you were nice to his gf. And not you are getting yelled at for not being nice to his gf. You need better friends.", "NTA, they can both go and get stuffed, I wouldnt talk to either of them again.", "INFO:  What does \"too nice to his girlfriend\" look like?\n\nThat's a whole bunch of toxicity and it would be for the best for if you backed away.  I'm waffling between NTA and ESH.", "NTA, and you need some new friends who are able to behave like reasonable adults.  Toxic drama queens don't get to tell others that they need to grow up.", "So now it's a problem to be nice and decent to a friend's girlfriend? Your former friend is definitely wrong and an idiot. Definitely NTA. Faking a death to get out of a conversation is bizarre and foolish. He did you a favor by ending this friendship. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust block both of their numbers, they are toxic AHs.", "INFO he doesn't want to be your friend so why is anyone calling you?", "NTA who tf fakes their own death because their friend is 'too nice' to their gf", "They treat women like they're beneath them.

I have it all on messenger.", "I never treated her badly. In fact I'd say I did more than her boyfriend by helping her get the things she needed after being kicked from her home.", "Yeah, that entire friend group sounds like trash. Luckily for you, they've shown you who they are.", "If I was you I\u2019d consider myself lucky that they don\u2019t want to be my friend then, you\u2019re better off", "Yes? So why is the gf texting you now, after you blocked him I mean?", "Oh, poor choice of words. She stopped after a while, it's the rest of our friends that are texting me. She only did it that Friday.", "But why? Why text you again? You blocked him that was the goal right?", "She never did texted me again. I only blocked him after I found out the truth.", "Sorry I now see that she called not texted. Why did she call you to tell you to grow up?", "Because we were arguing about the whole situation and she was stresses out that her boyfriend and I yelled at each other.", "Why was she arguing with you? She just told you he was dead and her boyfriend doesn't want to be friends?  Seems rather clear why you would be angry. \n\nStressed out? She just told you someone was dead.... \n\nThis whole story makes zero sense", "They fake your friend death because they didnt have the guts to just tell you they want the friendship to end and when you found out and ppl turning in you how they telling you the truth TF!", "Block them all! They are obviously not your friends if they don't see what he has done a huge problem. He's an ass for doing that you. So when him and his girlfriend break up and he shows up at your door begging you for forgiveness, slam the door in his face.", "Info: how old are yall? nta regardless but this sounds like some crazy high school shit lmao", "NTA. Treat them dead for life. He asked for it.", "These are not people you should wish to associate with.", "Um\u2026what did I just read? If this is true you\u2019re NTA.", "yeah you don't play like that. I would have went off on the GF for what she did. So hard she would want to do more than cutting.", "This is some alpha male bullshit. NTA", "OP was nice to the gf, not rude.", "jfc leave this friend group.  NOW.  FLEE. \n\nword of advice about life : if you\u2019re ever in a room and realize you\u2019re the nicest person there, leave.
