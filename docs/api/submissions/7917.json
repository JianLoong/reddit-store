This might not be how most Americans choose to spend their money, but this is by no means extreme. I personally think she is being financially responsible and thinking more about the long-term.", "Refusing to buy bread because I could make it cheaper? Can\u2019t say that has ever been my primary motivation to bake bread.", "I agreed with the rest of your points. I was just highlighting that he hasn't actually been deprived of these things. He goes out a lot.", "Well I\u2019m 55 and my parents passed 25 years ago, so I guess I didn\u2019t say it because I\u2019m living off my parents.", "I have to wonder what people are doing to their furniture.   I've bought IKEA and had it for years and even moved with it multiple times and it's still in great shape.\n\nSame with the cheap Sauder particleboard shelving that you used to be able to buy at Wally World for like $10 which is closer to $20 now.   I moved with those things like 6-8 times and they were still going strong. I think I eventually got rid of them in favor of the bigger IKEA shelves (and because they didn't match).\n\nI don't feel like I'm particularly careful either, but I must be.  I rarely have problems with stuff that people always say breaks easy.", "Really? Always? I feel like I remember people talking about the expectation of 20% being a new thing. I'm not American, so maybe the Americans who told me this were just cheap!", "Nothing wrong with eating at home when people come over because that\u2019s what we do too. But I assumed that in this case this was a restaurant they\u2019ve been wanting to try. And based on how OPs girlfriend doesn\u2019t like to buy takeout it looked like it was more of a money thing. Not saying the girl is an AH, but they both just seem to have different lifestyle habits", "I hate baking in general and so I bake bread to save money. It costs cents instead of $5-$6 a loaf.", "Have you baked bread by yourself already? I have not either but everytime someone did it at home, it tasted like 100x better than from the bakery. Worth noticing I am from Germany so I definately do not talk about the tasteless stuff foreign people call bread.", "Ive never heard of anyone refusing to buy bread like that either. She def sounds way too cheap. Frugal is one thing but she\u2019s def a cheapo. And she\u2019s the AH for bad tips\n\nNTA imo", "I see your point. But I try (try!) to watch my spending habits and eating out is a sore point for me. So I feel for him, more than I should.", "Same with me and my ikea furniture. I\u2019ve had these shelves for probably close to a decade? Moved multiple times. My sister is upset that I\u2019m still using them because she regrets getting rid of hers and doesn\u2019t want to buy new ones \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s very respectable. I would consider doing that if I was on an extremely tight budget. But if I made 6 figures and didn\u2019t have a soul crushing amount of debt, then I wouldn\u2019t do that. It would be worth it for the convenience for me. If OP\u2019s GF wants to live like this, it\u2019s her choice, but I personally feel it\u2019s extreme and if my significant other did it then I would be annoyed. It\u2019s a difference in mindset, that\u2019s all.", "Is it worth causing stress in a relationship you care about?  You could say this about virtually everything we do. Why not grow vegetables?  Or make clothing from scratch?  Wash your clothes by hand?  It all comes down to where you draw the line and it sounds like OP\u2019s line and his gf\u2019s are very different to the detriment of their relationship.", "It's not always about the cost or convenience. Handmade foods usually have better flavor and quality than store bought. They also don't have preservatives or unnecessary amounts of added salt.", "I hear that. However the post says \u201cshe won\u2019t buy bread or oat milk she insists to make it to save money\u201d"]}
