If you go to the Department of Labor website ([here](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped#main-content)) that lists all tipped minimum wages across the US, more than 50% of the states in the US count tips towards minimum wage and with tips employers are paying less than $5 an hour for minimum wage. That's not livable without the tips being good. So no \"many\" of us are not living in states where servers are being paid appropriately.\n\nThat said, no tipping restaurants in NYC tend to fail, as servers don't want to work there.

As a bagger and later cashier in high school, I was strictly instructed not to accept tips for this reason.

They might just not be compatible.\n\nBeing cheap is great, as long as you don't take your cheapness to tipping. There is no excuse for inadequate tipping. The current going rate is at least 20%.

Inadequate tipping is just inexcusably tacky.", "I think there\u2019s a difference between being frugal and being cheap. \n\nYour girlfriend does appear to be on the side of saving pennies and losing pounds. \n\nLike, sometimes the time investment in making your own, actually ends up with a significantly higher opportunity cost than simply buying the slightly higher priced product. Having to stop to set up and make a coffee on a road trip takes longer than simply buying one from a servo. Meaning you\u2019re either on the road a lot longer than necessary or you end up having to stop overnight when you might not have simply buying the $2 coffee. \n\nSimilarly, having a new handbag instead of carrying around a tattered old handbag may lose job or promotion opportunities.

And ikea furniture is already being frugal, used goods on Facebook marketplace is him giving in. her crappy tip is also an indication that she\u2019s taking it to far and not considering how others my feel in her attempt to save a buck.

Obviously It\u2019s good to be smart with money. It\u2019s good to have a savings and It\u2019s good to not blow money constantly on frivolous crap. But there\u2019s a fine line between being smart with money, and being cheap. I also hate the mentality of saving almost everything you make now for retirement. I was with someone like that once. They wanted to work constantly and put pretty much all of it into a retirement fund. I just couldn\u2019t get behind the idea. Obviously we all want to live comfortably when we\u2019re older, but I don\u2019t want to do nothing but work right now. I also absolutely hate it when people comment on how I spend my money. If I have enough money to support myself and do what I need to do, I don\u2019t want to hear comments when I get a coffee or when I go out to eat. I especially don\u2019t want to hear it if I get someone a gift and they get mad at me because I shouldn\u2019t have spent so much of my money on it. \n\nThis is why It\u2019s important to be financially compatible once you get older and if you\u2019re going to be serious with someone. It sounds like there is definitely room for balance in her spending and saving habits. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s room for balance in yours too. But if she isn\u2019t interested in making any changes and wants to live frugally, that\u2019s always going to be a point of disagreement for both of you. You\u2019re going to end up resenting each other, and you don\u2019t want that. Neither of you are really AHs in this situation, and I believe the way you\u2019re feeling is completely valid. The verdict here seems pretty split, but there are a lot of people being very harsh towards you, and I\u2019d just say It\u2019s because they have a mindset closer to your gf\u2019s.\n\nThe way people spend money has a lot to do with the way they grew up too. You tend to either inherit your parent\u2019s spending habits, or you develop the exact opposite of your parent\u2019s spending habits. (Parents, or whoever raised you or influenced you throughout your life). Either your gf\u2019s parents were extremely frugal too, or they blew their money out the window. This is what I guess whenever someone has very drastic spending habits on either end. My parent was very bad with money, and I was too for a while, and I had to learn to find a balance. I was able to do that and still treat myself to things. You just have to decide what you want the rest of your life to look like, and if your gf wants to continue being frugal, and it is her right to do so, then perhaps for your own happiness you may need to reevaluate your relationship with her.\n\nI wish you the best!

I'd be annoyed if I had to pay a price that should cover food and service, but then have to pay for service on top again.
