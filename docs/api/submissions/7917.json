If his gf lived in SA then of course she shouldn't tip, but lives in the US where it's part of their culture and expected.  \n\nIf she doesn't want to, then fine.  But you saying 'if we don't have to, why should OPs gf' is not a fair comparison.", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re living in the same South Africa. You\u2019re not the OP but today, YTA.", "Ah but not all fast food places are tip free. Many drive in type places (think sonic and A&W) with car hops still use tipping to make up their hourly pay.", "That\u2019s literally the whole point. It\u2019s legal to pay restaurant staff $2.13 an hour where I am and due to the fact that there aren\u2019t any laws preventing the underpayment of restaurant staff because of tips. If there was a law in place for that, awesome, it would stop this entire conversation in its tracks. Since there isn\u2019t, the only realistic option is to let these places go out of business unless they eradicate tipping themselves and pay a livable wage. Most places in the world don\u2019t deal with this because it\u2019s illegal to not pay your workers. \n\nAll this to say, if you\u2019re going to take advantage of a service, don\u2019t take advantage of the service person by screwing them out of the money they deserve.", "Businesses that don't adapt to what the market is demanding typically die, yeah. If they'd rather go out of business than pay their workers....that's on them. And if they can't afford to pay their workers, then it sounds like they can't afford to run a business in the first place.", "> What do you presume would happen if the majority of people stopped tipping en masse? \n\n\u2026.A bunch of servers relying on that money would be suddenly unable to pay their rent and eat.", "I\u2019ve read the thread. Stiffing your waitstaff if you are in the states is cheap. It\u2019s punishing the wrong person.", "I don't doubt you! It's still not capitalism.", "True but not tipping doesn\u2019t fix it.  Demanding better wages does.", "Hyper consumerism have made people believe they can only derive pleasure from moneymaking and spending activities. I think that's the saddest part of western civilization. I love making bread, cooking, making up new recipes, and I weave baskets from grape vines. I also love gardening, thrifting and reading.\n\nall of my hobbies are outside of spending money and  they help me eat well, stay active and have a purposeful life. I genuinely don't know why people prefer the consumer culture where you have to fight about worker exploitation culture...", "That, and the coffeemaker thing.\n\nAnd buying only secondhand furniture to save money. I get the point, but I think she is overdoing it. Op is not in the wrong either to want to take his brother out to a fancy place if he pays - which she seems to be against also, so it's definitely inching towards ESH.\n\nMy thinking is that she or her family might have had financial issues early on that stuck with her. Regardless, finances can break a relationship, and they definitely don't seem to be financially compatible.", "And then they discontinue the line entirely, and you can't buy new ones!  Just similar ones.", "I don\u2019t think so as she got very mad when he got him an expensive dress.", "And I bring my own coffee to work. My husband makes all of our bread because he\u2019s a pastry chef. \n\nWe can pick and choose what is what but all of this added up sounds like trauma. I worked in mental health for 5 years as of 4 months ago.

I think culture is peer pressure from living people. But to each their own, except OPs gf, I guess...", "If OPs girlfriend lived in South Africa she would need to tip because that is the norm", "That's often the experience of the other 10%.\n\nEta:\n https://www.statista.com/statistics/1127838/national-poverty-line-in-south-africa/", "Yep, tipping options are in terminals at most fast food places now (except for drive throughs). (and this is in Canada btw). It\u2019s tipflation and I hate it. Businesses should pay their staff properly - and yes, I know not tipping isn\u2019t the answer and just punishes waitstaff; that\u2019s why I don\u2019t eat out as much as I once did. If more people are doing the same, that hurts servers too. Sorry for the off-topic rant:)", "Also, not supporting the system, like OP says he basically coerces her into eating out because she doesn't believe in eating out. So it's a moral issue to me, why is she being blamed because he forces her to shoot a system she doesn't believe in? I say that because I also don't eat out because I don't believe in the system. That's the point I'm making.", "Who knows how she grew up, and due to that experience, shaped up how she goes about? Doesnt matter she makes 6 figures because that can disappear just like that. It's good she knows how to make do if something very severe were to happen.", "That's my thing, I don't mind paying a little extra for convenience. \n\nOP's girlfriend would drive me crazy if I were dating her and, honestly, I'd just break up with her because we have totally different lifestyles.\n\nStill, that's no excuse for name calling. If you don't like dating someone \"cheap\" then you should just split up.\n\nYTA OP.", "Oh absolutely, my comment was directed at the person I replied to and not a reflection of OP's situation. It sounds like they're not compatible.\n\nAs an amusing (to me) aside, I do actually grow 99% of my veggies, and I have a loom for making cloth (and a friend who makes wool from her sheep, so I trade with her). I do use a washing machine but I hang all my clothes to dry. Either outside or over my woodstove. That being said, my partner equally shares the workload and we love living this life.", "Almost all my furniture is second hand. Why would you buy new if you can get better quality, longer lasting used furniture more cheaply?", "Yea agreed", "This is a fair take. If she wants to live her life this then there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that. It\u2019s just that if her BF doesn\u2019t feel the same way, they won\u2019t be happy together.", "It think it was a handbag. And spending huge amounts of money on her is not the same as him spending money on himself.", "Literally nothing to do with it, their system is built on it and without it the servers are the ones punished.  Fighting to change wages and the system is one thing, but punishing the serving staff is awful.  \n\nAnd, no, I'm not talking about your culture but the one in the US.", "Not according to the poster I was talking to, who says it isn't.", "I honestly hate going out now because of inflation hitting everything. Wages, food, tipping, gas and a babysitter if it\u2019s a kid free date night. When we do go out I make sure we tip 20% even if the service was crappy.  \nBtw I love your username. Is it a Cats (musical) reference? Cause he\u2019s my favorite Cat.", "Ha that\u2019s pretty cool that you actually do all the things that I assumed you don\u2019t do", "It's great if you had luck with it, it was really a hit or miss for me. And there is no surefire way to say it'll be longer lasting - unless it's like a family heirloom cabinet passed down for over a hundred years.\n\nBut my point really was that some people, like OP apparently, enjoy new things once in a while. It's fine if she doesn't want to pay for it, but she seems to want to control even his own financial decisions, which is just, no.", "You are right a handbag, I just don\u2019t think they are compatible, I am sure as frustrated he is with her his spending probably makes her anxious.", "I'm just glad we're getting the conversation about the problematic underpaying culture public.", "Yeah, but that\u2019s her boyfriend\u2019s assumption that it\u2019s the only reason. If you asked her she might say, it\u2019s cheaper and better bread.", "I agree that they're probably financially incompatible.", "Hardly, it's just Reddit.  No reflection of, or influence on, real life.", "Or she might say she just doesn\u2019t want to spend the money. No way to know unless she comes to post here. Either way, I think this is extreme. Clearly, others do not."]}
