Some of my friends feel differently (I respect that), but I think that it\u2019s weird to use someone for a free meal and then reject them immediately afterwards. Why add insult to injury like that? But with that said OP is NTA. That guy sounds like a total psycho. If he\u2019s as bad as I imagine, then I can see why she took the free meal for her wasted evening.", "Are these guys not embarrassed when they do this\u2026", "If you can't afford to go out to dinner and pay for your own meal then just say you're broke. McDonald's is always hiring.", "Nice", "I have brothers and a father as well as a husband. I also was a female kickboxing champion and trained judo for 8 years. I'm a brown belt in jiu-jitsu so I'm not worried about a man attacking me and me not being able to defend myself.", "A point I think is important about why dinner dates are a terrible idea (and coffe/drinks/walk) etc. are great - if it goes badly, you can just leave.\n\nYou've normally already paid for the drinks, so you just need to make a polite excuse and run.\n\nDinner - you're probably stuck until you can get the bill, unless you want to take a nuclear option."]}
