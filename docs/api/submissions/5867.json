And that comment speaks volumes of your character.  That you care more about what people can give you compared to what kind of person they are.\n\n\nYou may very well find someone who only wants to shower you with money and never have you pay a dime.  However more than likely you will never be a true equal. I personally think your values are shallow. But of that's your relationship goals.
