He chose not OP", "And yet we live in a world where many women do in fact expect to have money spent on them by men, so it's hardly like it's one sided.", "Most impressed I've ever been on a date was someone who refused to let me pay for her. I offered, she said no and it was amazing. I didn't realize how much I resented the stereotype that the guy should always pay until then.", "I\u2019m a woman and I always offer to split the bill. More often than not the offer is refused, but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s genuine. It generally seems to be appreciated. I\u2019m 37 years old with a job, a house, and a car. I can buy my own dinner if I want it.", "Don't offer to pay for meals you can't afford. Stop playing games and tell your date that since it is possible that the date won't work out, you would like to split the bill. \n\nThe problem with guys like you is that you want to pretend to be generous when you are really not. You pretend that you are happy to pay when you are only happy to do so as part of a transaction. But you won't tell the girl upfront to split the bill because you want to pretend that you are something that you are not. Not classy dude. This is easy to fix, just tell her that you always split first dates.", "She didn\u2019t accept knowing she wasn\u2019t interested, though. In your analogy, make it instead that halfway through the dinner, you realize that this company isn\u2019t a good fit for you. But you\u2019re already there, and you already ordered and started eating in good faith. So you gracefully finish the meal and then turn the job down the next day.\n\nA date, or interview, is about getting to know each other. Someone who invites you to one can\u2019t retroactively change what they themselves chose to set up based on what you learn about them being negative.", "She did not choose the restaurant, she wanted to get to know him, she wasn't after a \"free fancy meal\". He he chose the expensive restaurant because he is a creep who wanted to buy her interest. \n\nIf you ask someone out you should either choose something you are happy to pay the full amount for regardless of the outcome or you should request that the bill be split upfront when suggesting the date. \n\nHe chose an expensive place on purpose to buy her off, a place he wasn't comfortable paying for, and then was angry when he didn't get what he thought he paid for. He is a complete creep and she doesn't owe him a cent.", "Don\u2019t pay attention to anything this clown says, sounds like a black pill", "He was first angry but then his ramble turned into a mess of an apology. Saying that he\u2019s \u201cin love\u201d and wants to go on another date (where I don\u2019t have to pay lol)\n\nAlso said we\u2019d make \u201ccute babies\u201d. And in the same breath made a grossly sexual comment. Totally not a red flag /s", "Omg and if the date goes bad and you have to stay for the whole dinner\u2026", ">You tey to plan another date the next day where she tells you \"yeah, no. Not my type\". At that point you feel like you were taken advantage of and used for a free meal.\n\nOr you could look at it this way - you had the entire time it takes to eat a meal to make a good impression.  You failed.  The end.      \n\n\nA lot of times that 'nothing screams no longer interested' is just your date having good manners.", "I always ask the server for separate checks.  If the date absolutely refuses and insists on paying for dinner, I insist that they allow me to buy a round of drinks after dinner, or I may offer to cook/buy dinner next time - but I always reciprocate.  I'm not there for the food, I'm there for the company.\n\nNot sure I understand women who date just for a free meal.  I'm sure they're out there, but ... ???   I'd rather eat ramen at home than eat lobster with some dude that doesn't interest me.", "If you invited her out, you should pay, in my opinion, at least for the first date. If you can\u2019t afford something expensive, plan something within your budget like an activity.", "Agree. It\u2019s crazy behaviour and it\u2019s no wonder she wasn\u2019t into him.", "I never said she owed him anything. Thus has to be the most illiterate sub on Reddit? Can you seriously not read? Stop putting words in my mouth.\n\nAnd BS. It is not dangerous to tell a guy you're not interested in him in the middle of a crowded restaurant. That is such crap.", "I've never shot a bill in my life.\n\nYou know nothing about me and nothing I said implied anything you wrote.\n\nAgain, a woman that twists words into something that wasn't said and then argues the new made up version.\n\nI still don't understand how my saying that a woman that was upfront about not feeling it would be an exceptional example of a woman. Do you ladies all have such an inferiority complex that if you're not in my \"elite\" that I'm somehow shaming you?\n\nGet the chip off your shoulder.", "Exactly. The outcome of the date is either going to be you see each other again, or you don\u2019t. It\u2019s a 50/50 chance you take when you invite someone out. They owe you nothing but an open mind which OP had.", "They went to an expensive luxurious restaurant because the dude thought he could buy himself sex with OP that way", "She accepted going to an expensive place. Any point if what should have been discussed is as much up to OP as it is to the guy.", "A date should be a test to see if you mutually enjoy each other's company, not something one person does as a *favor* to another. It's pretty much always better to split the bill on the first date, to avoid setting up weird power imbalances. \n\nOnce you get to know and like each other, *then* it makes sense to start treating each other.", "If he drove there certainly is. And yes he could wait until she leaves. You are obviously a man.", "Very normal reply, no reason for women to be nervous to speak to men.", "The fact that you are more concerned about my gender than the content of my criticism has strong incel vibes. \"Again a woman twists words into something.....\". Shame.", "By doing that you\u2019re essentially punishing people for accepting dates to places that they had no control over. Imagine agreeing to a date then sitting down and noticing the menu is way over your price point. Now you\u2019re stuck trying to embarrassingly tell a stranger that you can\u2019t afford this place. If someone is asking for your time and controlling where you\u2019re going, then they should pay for that date no matter their gender. Youre the one giving them a chance over someone else or your own time. This applies to first dates but after that people should alternate or split.", "She didn't go with the intention of never seeing him again; she just found that she didn't enjoy it while there and didn't care to do it again. There was absolutely no intent to deceive and it's incredibly unhealthy to have that perspective.", "Nope, if the guy offers to take someone out (man or woman) and OFFERS to pay, they shouldn\u2019t only be paying on the condition there will be another date and/or sex. Most women do pay for their own things now to avoid this, but they\u2019re not obligated to say halfway through the date (AFTER the guy said he will pay) \u2018oh by the way, I\u2019m not actually interested so I\u2019ll pay for my own stuff\u2019.", "Uber\n\nAnd I still call bs. If he knows where she lives, how is texting it any better?\n\nYou are obviously too immature to be dating, regardless of your sex.", "And the really sad thing here is that you're implying that rejecting a man is basically committing suicide. So it must take a brave woman to do that.\n\nWhich is exactly what I said. All I said is that if a woman did that, I would put her in an elite class of women. And it actually sounds like you agree? So why are you arguing?", "No, a reason for women to not put words in other peoples mouths.\n\nYou and every other woman in here has a cup on her shoulder and instead of replying to what was actually said, you trust into some absurd statement and then get all pissed off at the statement you made up.", "You did the same thing.\n\nPot meet kettle.\n\nAnd I did address your words. They were made up. I never said anything you are arguing.\n\nYou're more focused on my inceldom than the content of my words...", "Because most of my experiences with males have been entirely negative - at times downright disturbing -  so I\u2019d rather not go out of my way and approach a man. It\u2019s for my own safety.", "He would\u2019ve probably declined anyways. So it\u2019s not like it would\u2019ve helped the situation.", "You obviously have no reference or experience for how wild men can get when faced with rejection.", "I\u2019m 63 and been with my husband for almost 30 years kiddo. And you are clueless.", "No but women are aware that men can respond to rejection with violence. You don\u2019t seem to realize that.", "I'm unsure what you mean by cope harder.", "Being 63 doesn't make you smart.\n\nI'm almost your age and been married almost as long.", "Please point to a single comment where I implied that.", "Stop projecting buddy.", "This one, where you literally claim that it's not dangerous and that thinking so is BS: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxehwe/aita_for_not_paying_back_my_date/j21cstu/", "I'll admit that by the standards of reddit, I might be pretty old at 51.\n\nBut as someone who definitely came of age in a time when men were expected to pay for dates, the social politeness of dating was met here.\n\nHe asked her out. He picked the restaurant. He set the time. She was interested enough to accept.\n\nIn the process of one on one conversation during the meal, she realized that she wasn't interested in him. She finished the meal and her obligation to provide him company for that meal.\n\nHe insisted on paying for it.\n\nDeciding after, that because she wasn't interested, that she owed him for her meal was wrong. She had finished her obligation. Again- HE picked the restaurant.\n\nIf it was a date which the tab was split, then both parties need to agree to that beforehand and pick the restaurant together. Otherwise, she was his guest and had met all the obligations of that.", "You left out the part of it being in the middle of a crowded restaurant.\n\nBeen eating it for a lot of years and never seen a woman get beat up at Applebee's..."]}
