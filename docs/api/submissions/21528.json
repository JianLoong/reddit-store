We were soon buying cryptocurrencies and constantly discussing opportunities. In August 2017, Kyle discovered an odd price manipulation on a cryptocurrency exchange that smelled of money laundering. He managed to profit from this, making about $7,000. We were astonished; it was a huge sum for us.\r  \n\r  \nBeing a software engineer, I decided to develop a bot to identify such market manipulations. It was quite simple, looking for large order book spreads. I shared this bot with Peter and Kyle, and we used it on a shared account, making substantial money.\r  \n\r  \nSeeing the bot's success, I thought of creating more sophisticated strategies. I shared this idea with Peter \u2014 he had a knack for trading strategies. He proposed several ideas, but none were practical. Regardless, I set up the bot on his computer and showed him how to use it.\r  \n\r  \nPeter suggested sharing the bot with Kyle too, citing his earlier contribution.

I said no way. Despite his attempts to make me feel sorry for them, I didn't change my mind.

As a teacher, I discovered a high percentage of cheats and plagiarizers.   I think a lot of people hustle like this.    Maybe you could set up a strong barrier by threatening to sue for theft of intellectual property.    Best wishes.", "NTA", "NTA. Peter is a greedy schemer. He is accusing you of what he did. He is stealing your code, your work. Cut him off. Wash your reputation where you want and can. Tell your side of the story.\n\nFor the rest, do not regret too much the financial loss.

Money Laundering in particular is likely to be a federal crime.", "Crypto is just hopping on a pump and dump and hoping you get off in time to leave someone else with the bag. It's the modern day pyramid scheme.", "Governments are continuously doing that.", "I don\u2019t think you know what money laundering is. \n\nMoney laundering is if you have a lot of money from a crime and do something to make the source of it so it look legitimate. \n\n\nOften a cash business. \n\n\nLet\u2019s say there is a pizza place by you. You realize their food is unreasonably cheap. It\u2019s so cheap because they actually also sell drugs and adjust the receipts so the drug money looks like food money. \n\nGoing to that restaurant and buying a large pizza for $5 isn\u2019t money laundering. What is is essentially doing is just buying that large pizza for $5 (legal) then reselling it down the block for $10 (also legal). \n\nThat\u2019s not money laundering, even if the cheap restaurant is only selling the pizza for cheap because they are laundering money.", "Okay and?", "Lol just because the government does it doesn\u2019t make it ok. But also this story is fake af anyways", "Yes? Crypto has been used for Money Laundering for ages because of how hard it is to trace. It\u2019s literally perfect. Profiting off of money laundering is still a felony crime no matter how much or how little.", "Yes, but even if crypto is being used for money laundering he isn\u2019t committing any crimes by realizing their is a market inefficiency and acting as a market maker. \n\nWhich is what he was doing. His algos where designed to recognize a pattern that lead to market inefficiencies and capitalize on them. Where those inefficiencies from money laundering? Maybe? Maybe not? \n\n\nIt\u2019s no more illegal than a market maker seeing someone offer a stock for sale for $1 and another person making a bid to buy at $1.01 and then taking both orders and keeping the penny which happens a billion times a day.", "So buying that pizza is a felony? I doubt it.", "I mean what's illegal and what's ethical are two different things. If you are making money off of sketchy markets your income is based on sketchy markets existing, and while it is not illegal to not report a possible crime it is a bit unethical to be completely ignorant to it when it has the hallmarks of one. It's sort of like if if you bought cheap jewellery from a person from an area where there has been jewellery theft. Like you don't know if that's the person but you still have the choice of buying the jewellery for cheap and say you are profiting like a market hustler/ garage sale buyer might look for undervalued pieces from people who don't know better or reporting that person to an authority who might prevent the crimes from happening again.", "Exactly", "OP seemingly knew it was Money Laundering, if he knew then the question is how for me, but assuming he knew it doesn\u2019t matter. He knowingly profited from a felony crime making OP complicit and liable, AKA: OP is a criminal, I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s a fact.", "If you can be proven to be knowingly engaging in money laundering? (Which OP states he knew it was), yes, it is.", "Only if one of the toppings is crack.", "Well to make him a criminal, first it would have to be shown what was happening was illegal. First it would need to be shown it was actually money laundering and shown the money laundering was illegal in whatever jurisdictions the person doing it and exchange operate in.\n\n Neither of which is really knowable or provable. \n\n\nBut regardless, even if you are 100% right and he was actually sent to jail for this and provable guilty of profiting off the crime. That still doesn\u2019t make him and asshole. He isn\u2019t laundering money. He isn\u2019t hurting any innocent people. He isn\u2019t even really helping them, just skimming some money away from them.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think skimming money away from rich criminals is morally wrong", "Lmao he just saw some weird market stuff going on, he didn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d anything. Can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re in middle school or that was just as far as your education went", "I am a bit lost ethically on this, I mean I think raking the stock market (both real life and crypto) is pretty much against what it was originally set out to do anyways (supporting start up/ developing businesses with early cash) and I don't really support it but is this technically a \"Robin Hood\" type thing where you are highjacking another scheme to get a cut or by initially investing in the coin could that actually benefit the laundering in any way? I mean at the very least it could help them to claim it being a valid coin if it has outside buyers and they would take a small loss if it kept the overall money in the pool.", "I didn't \"know\" it, that's just the only thing that would make sense to me. I wouldn't regret taking money away from such operations.", "Stealing from a thief still makes you a thief, what it comes down to is what you do with the money afterwards, seeing as OP was planning to profit I assume it was kept for themselves, and so they are not really much better.", "Personal insults, lovely. Not even worth the effort giving a proper response."]}
