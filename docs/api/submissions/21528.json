We were soon buying cryptocurrencies and constantly discussing opportunities. In August 2017, Kyle discovered an odd price manipulation on a cryptocurrency exchange that smelled of money laundering. He managed to profit from this, making about $7,000. We were astonished; it was a huge sum for us.\r  \n\r  \nBeing a software engineer, I decided to develop a bot to identify such market manipulations. It was quite simple, looking for large order book spreads. I shared this bot with Peter and Kyle, and we used it on a shared account, making substantial money.\r  \n\r  \nSeeing the bot's success, I thought of creating more sophisticated strategies. I shared this idea with Peter \u2014 he had a knack for trading strategies. He proposed several ideas, but none were practical. Regardless, I set up the bot on his computer and showed him how to use it.\r  \n\r  \nPeter suggested sharing the bot with Kyle too, citing his earlier contribution. I agreed, until I discovered that Peter had already shared it without asking me. This pissed me off slightly, but I didn't say anything. Now, my bots were competing with each other for profits.

I said no way. Despite his attempts to make me feel sorry for them, I didn't change my mind. Interestingly, when I had previously talked to him about bringing a coworker onboard to help me with coding, Peter shot down the idea, talking about how we would make less money.
