Then he can act like one as well.", "NTA, It's for Christmas not anything more, why did he ship it directly to her?

If it it doesn't really matter to him, why does he care when the present is opened?\n\nApart from this, it isn't all about what he wants.

And, money being what it is, I've had a decades long habit of buying our gifts through the year, and then putting them under the tree for the last month all wrapped... they look beautiful, and the anticipation builds the enjoyment. \n\nWe went round about it like a gridgematch of Rachel Maddow vs Sean Hannity. \n\nAnd this is the Joy of Being A Single Woman Over 40.

This cannot be the first time him not wanting to wait for Christmas has come up.", "Nta. I feel like the gift receiver should be able to decide when she open her presents. I get where he\u2019s coming from, but there is clearly joy around Christmas presents being Christmas presents in your family, so maybe he needs to adapt to your family\u2019s wants when dealing with your family \n\n(I say that over Christmas presents and simple stuff like that, other boundaries are different.)", "NAH \nI can't fault him for the excitement. Maybe he's never done this before.  \n\nBut why did he participate if he knew the premise for it was as a Christmas gift? \n\nSince it's super early in the season for Christmas shopping- I'm gonna chalk it up to excitement on first time family traditions and its seasonal activities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His pushing was along the lines of after her saying she\u2019d put it under the tree him saying he insists he opens it - which I don\u2019t think was him meaning to be pushy or anything he just really wanted her to open it and is a bit upset that she\u2019s going to wait. Her wanting to wait til Christmas is her decision, she was uncomfortable with the idea of opening it early/away from the group but that\u2019s information that came out after the argument.

She can be a bit passive and sometimes needs a middle man to step in, so she\u2019s since said she wants to wait for Christmas and now that he knows he\u2019ll respect it.", "Now this is part of the thing for me - and please feel free to call me an AH for this because I genuinely want to know - is that I feel like if it was just a Christmas gift then that\u2019s fine and you can do whatever you want. In my head though because it\u2019s a secret Santa and the premise is that everyone opens their gifts at the same time then they should be kept for that moment. Am I overthinking that?", "I disagree. Everyone decided to do Secret Santa. I think it'd be rude if someone said \"No, I'm not going to open my gift with everyone else. When you agree to a secret Santa, you agree to the rules of it, which is usually everyone doing it on the same day.", "That\u2019s fair to say. I think I felt that if it was just a gift between them then that\u2019s cool, but because it\u2019s a secret Santa where everyone is meant to open them together then they should be opened together. I\u2019m an over-thinker though so I can acknowledge I may have focussed on that too much instead of just being chill.", "I\u2019m not sure how this is out of our control? I get what you\u2019re saying but I\u2019ve acknowledged that if it wasn\u2019t a group activity and she was cool with it then it wouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "I get that, and I think that was his thinking too. Knowing my sister I knew she wouldn\u2019t want to and she doesn\u2019t, but she can be quite passive. My thinking was just why even put the temptation right in front of her with six weeks to go.", "How grim! I have received a box of melted and re-solidified Easter eggs (/ easter puddles) that had been stored beside a radiator. Hopefully this isn't going to be the case for OP's sister!", "Yeah you're probably right", "Great! People have different traditions but since it's a gift for your sister it's her preference that matters.", "I think you are overthinking and overcomplicating it. Giving and receiving gifts should not have this many rules. It is not like you are doing a white elephant/yankee swap. You are doing a secret santa to cut down on the crazy, so don't add it back in.", "He's taking both the \"secret\" and the \"santa\" out of it. You're definitely right and it's way easier for you to talk to your partner about it than it is for your sister.", "Absolutely. I think part of my thinking was - and you can drag me for this - that if it\u2019s just a gift for her that\u2019s cool but the premise of secret Santa is that we all open them together so that\u2019s what I wanted. I think we both had slightly selfish intentions, perhaps.", "I love rules \ud83d\ude05 but you\u2019re right, thanks", "If the plan is secret Santa she shouldn't even know its from him yet. Accidents happen but that's kind of irrelevant. The plan is secret Santa and if you're opening together that's the plan.\nMy partner's family opens gifts on Christmas Eve, which is not how my family does it so \"weird\" to me. But on Christmas Eve either if we are there or over FaceTime presents get opened on Christmas Eve. Not a big deal. I'll open other gifts on Christmas Day if I want to. Their family has their tradition and it takes no effort for me to respect it. Now I get to open presents on two days!", "I do to. And I have totally been the you in this type if situation around the holidays before. But I finally realized that I cannot make things \"perfect\" (i.e. the way I want them) by forcing other people to act or do things a certain way. It just causes me stress and makes them annoyed. Even when things would go exactly as I planned them, I still wasn't happy with the result because it was such a stressful battle to get there. Not to be corny, but the feelings and magic of Christmas that you are looking to create by orchestrating the perfect gift exchange will happen naturally if you just focus on being together with the people you love.", "Thanks! She organised the secret Santa.", "NAH.  I'm reminded of Shrodinger's Cat.  If the box starts to smell then you've got a problem.", "If he really thinks it isn\u2019t a big deal, why can\u2019t he wait for Christmas?", "NTA. Finally nobody in a situation is for a change. You aren't and neither is he. He is excited and yay that's great but he'll still be excited on Christmas. Little does he seem to realize that if it really is a good gift, then everybody will want to see it. Hopefully, it's not perishable, literally the only good reason to open it early.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to learn impulse control.", "How is it \"out of his control\". Literally all he needs to do is say \"okay,\" when her sister says \"I'll open it on Christmas\".", "I understand it's for a Christmas game but I'm also really laid back lol. I'm more of an it is what it is girl and life's too short to be anything but happy (not saying implying you're unhappy) kind of chick.
