Your family, your traditions. \n\nI was shocked that he had it shipped directly to her. Why not just have it shipped to himself and actually give it to her at Christmas?", "NTA\n\nJust becouse he thinks it is not a big deal he can not just assume everyone feels the same. \nHe should respect that you guys want to wait until Christmas, if he doesnt sucks to be him then. \nHe is a grown adult.... Then he can act like one as well.", "NTA, It's for Christmas not anything more, why did he ship it directly to her? Some people can't hold off on opening gifts, it's your family's tradition to open on Christmas day nothing more so he should wait until then.", "NTA\n\nIf Christmas isn't a big deal to him and his family, why did he buy anyone a Christmas present? If it it doesn't really matter to him, why does he care when the present is opened?\n\nApart from this, it isn't all about what he wants. As you say, Christmas is supposed to be a group activity, shared with family and friends.  As Christmas is not a big deal for him, he should go along with those to whom Christmas is a big deal.", "NTA \n\nI get Christmas isn\u2019t a big deal to him, but he\u2019s kinda ruined the premise of secret Santa for your sister \ud83d\ude02 it\u2019s supposed to stay a secret till opening day and now she knows who has her. \n\nI get that he\u2019s super excited (believe me, I\u2019m the same) and knows she\u2019s gonna love it, but it\u2019s still like a whole month away yet.

Do you always excuse this behaviour for him? Because the \"reason\" you provided (\"christmas isn't a big deal to *his* family\") isn't relevant when he's participating in *your* family's christmas traditions, and an adult would acknowledge that.", "NTA. Husband needs to respect that your sister wants to save the gift for Christmas. Why is he pushing this unless he has bought something perishable? The initial ask was fine, but he can reign it in now he knows she's happy to wait.", "NTA. I'm 54. Single mom. So I AM Santa, for myself and everyone. Saw a cute dragon incense burner when I was out with a friend at Rennfaire this summer, bought it as one of my gifts. \n\nHe lost his MIND, truly couldn't understand the concept of delaying gratification for a present to open Christmas Morning. But I want my present on CHRISTMAS. And, money being what it is, I've had a decades long habit of buying our gifts through the year, and then putting them under the tree for the last month all wrapped... they look beautiful, and the anticipation builds the enjoyment. \n\nWe went round about it like a gridgematch of Rachel Maddow vs Sean Hannity. \n\nAnd this is the Joy of Being A Single Woman Over 40. It's my Christmas tree  it'll sit under, and my present, in my house, with my 22 year old daughter...and lemme tell ya... men are great for some things, but it's very nice to not have to explain to them why their being an idiot. Or have to justify argue defend or explain.  I could just pat him on the head and send him home... \n\nTo his sad little life with no presents on Christmas.", "I'm gonna go NAH, mostly because I think everyone here is genuinely trying to make someone else happy.", "NTA. If she doesn\u2019t want to open it and it would ruin the tradition, why is he even arguing? Did he get her an ice sculpture that\u2019s about to melt?", "If there has to be an AH YTA. He cares more about the gift and wants her to have it now and does not care to wait for Christmas. \n\nIf he wanted her to open it now and I guess depending on how much \"he pushed\" then it may be an issue but if it's just he really wanted her to open it now...who cares. This cannot be the first time him not wanting to wait for Christmas has come up.", "Nta. I feel like the gift receiver should be able to decide when she open her presents. I get where he\u2019s coming from, but there is clearly joy around Christmas presents being Christmas presents in your family, so maybe he needs to adapt to your family\u2019s wants when dealing with your family \n\n(I say that over Christmas presents and simple stuff like that, other boundaries are different.)", "NAH \nI can't fault him for the excitement. Maybe he's never done this before.  \n\nBut why did he participate if he knew the premise for it was as a Christmas gift? \n\nSince it's super early in the season for Christmas shopping- I'm gonna chalk it up to excitement on first time family traditions and its seasonal activities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is your family and when in Rome...", "NTA \n\nIt's not about \"Christmas\" being a big deal. It's about having fun. If 9 other people have a gift to open on that day, and your sister doesn't, that's just awkward and less fun....he is making it all about the presents and not the activity. \n\n\nDoesn't matter if you were doing a Christmas gift exchange, or a third Tueday in July gift exchange, or a National Hairball Awarness Day gift exchange. He's totally ruining the point/fun. \n\n\nEven by telling you who he picked and that he sent the gift, ruins some of the secret Santa fun....what if you had gotten him.", "NTA", "ESH - you are fighting about something that is outside of both of your control.

She must have a pretty well known interest.", "If its a puppy she should probably open it.", "Sounds like he wanted something and the wife turned it into an argument...not him.", "I'm reading this comment as meaning that the OP's sister doesn't want to open her only present seven or eight weeks before Christmas:\n\n>she brushed it off as a joke and said she\u2019d put it under the tree", "Sure but then we are guessing as if she thought it was a joke and his reply could have easily been \"na I don't mind if you open it, I dont care if you do it now vs christmas\". I do find it odd seemingly no one here knows eachother enough to understand what is a joke and who cares about it or not...that seems odd depending on how long they've been together.\n\nWe are all guessing a lot here as clearly the story is written with a specific view but we don't actually know what \"pushing\" is in the context. I wouldn't mind hearing from his POV"]}
