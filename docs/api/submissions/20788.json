It\u2019s your wedding if you don\u2019t want the kids there your sister and her husband should be able to accommodate YOUR wishes on YOUR day. Some weddings are adult only weddings and even though you got a crap ton of nieces and nephews the sister and husband should understand where you are coming from not wanting a bunch of kids running around on your wedding day. I mean they could find a sitter maybe you could help them find one.", "NTA.  One of my older cousins had a no-kids wedding when I was about 12, and I thought her solution was a smart one, especially for big families with lots of kids like ours.  She booked a pair of sitters, set us up at her mom\u2019s house, and we had pizzas and movies and an ice cream sundae bar.  I think there were about 7 kids (all of us being her younger cousins), but enough of us were on the older side that 2 sitters were enough.  It meant that the kids had more fun than they would\u2019ve at the wedding, were out of the way (in addition to normal wedding stuff, she and her friends were pretty hard partiers), it was cheaper than having us at the wedding, no disruptions from kids, and the parents didn\u2019t have to figure out a sitter and a place to put the sitter and kids far from home.  I\u2019ve long thought that this was a pretty great solution for child-free weddings.  The fact that the kids still get family time (just with their own generation) and get to enjoy a party that is much more enjoyable to them helps with convincing parents, I think.  Not to mention, they don\u2019t have to dress their kids up or worry about keeping them under control, they can just relax and enjoy the wedding.", "NTA. This isn't her wedding.

We were out of space in the main room so we set up a kids room and hired a baby sitter to supervise so the parents could get a break themselves.
