One of my older cousins had a no-kids wedding when I was about 12, and I thought her solution was a smart one, especially for big families with lots of kids like ours.

I think there were about 7 kids (all of us being her younger cousins), but enough of us were on the older side that 2 sitters were enough.  It meant that the kids had more fun than they would\u2019ve at the wedding, were out of the way (in addition to normal wedding stuff, she and her friends were pretty hard partiers), it was cheaper than having us at the wedding, no disruptions from kids, and the parents didn\u2019t have to figure out a sitter and a place to put the sitter and kids far from home.  I\u2019ve long thought that this was a pretty great solution for child-free weddings.  The fact that the kids still get family time (just with their own generation) and get to enjoy a party that is much more enjoyable to them helps with convincing parents, I think.

Local, or does the sister have to travel and/or stay the night?\n\nI don't have a problem with kid-less weddings, but if you have that much family with small children that you hoped to have at the wedding, you probably should have considered some kind of \"child care\" that could be available to them. You don't even have to pay for it, you can have it arranged at the venue or nearby and parents pay a flat fee for the childcare. Not staying it's something you have to do or else you are an asshole, but you just said if all your guests brought their kids, you'd have nearly 20 kids under 10- that's a lot of people arranging for childcare who might not have it.", "I dont really get people that have something against kid's or kids in weddings and I have a strong opinion on people tripping on having \"kids free wedding\", it is rude to invite a family and say \"no kids though\".\n\nThat said, if someone invited me and said \"no kids\" I would never try to make them to let me bring mine, I would attend the wedding and enjoy it nonetheless.\nNTA", "God I can\u2019t wait until wedding season is over and AITA isn\u2019t just post after endless post about whether people are bridezillas. \n\nNTA", "How old are her kids?", "If the kids are 15-17 maybe.

People who don't have the money to actually take care of their kids, usually end up parentifying their eldest child, aka forcing that child to become a co-parent and raise their kids for them. Exactly what is great about that? The expensive card is an absolutely reasonable card to play, because Raven kids take money. If you don't have the money to provide for your child, you should not be having kids. If you're not able to get reasonable help, or refuse to get reasonable help, then you should not be having kids. If you have not planned for every single possible emergency, or are not ready to plan for every possible emergency, then you shouldn't be having kids. Having kids takes a lot more than just love and compassion. It takes money, it takes resources, it takes planning, it takes stability. That is something that not a lot of people consider when having kids. It's something that I have considered greatly, and it is a major factor and why I don't want kids. I absolutely love kids, I absolutely adore my nieces and nephews. But, I recognize that with my mental state, my financial status, and with all of those other factors I just mentioned, I am not a suitable candidate to have kids.
