I think there were about 7 kids (all of us being her younger cousins), but enough of us were on the older side that 2 sitters were enough.  It meant that the kids had more fun than they would\u2019ve at the wedding, were out of the way (in addition to normal wedding stuff, she and her friends were pretty hard partiers), it was cheaper than having us at the wedding, no disruptions from kids, and the parents didn\u2019t have to figure out a sitter and a place to put the sitter and kids far from home.  I\u2019ve long thought that this was a pretty great solution for child-free weddings.  The fact that the kids still get family time (just with their own generation) and get to enjoy a party that is much more enjoyable to them helps with convincing parents, I think.

The couple would be getting married with or without the family there.

What happens if they ruin the DJ's equipment? You're on the hook for that. What happens if they end up getting injured? You are on the hook for that. Those are all things you need to factor in when allowing kids at your wedding. If you're okay with those risks, then by all means go for it.
