I think there were about 7 kids (all of us being her younger cousins), but enough of us were on the older side that 2 sitters were enough.  It meant that the kids had more fun than they would\u2019ve at the wedding, were out of the way (in addition to normal wedding stuff, she and her friends were pretty hard partiers), it was cheaper than having us at the wedding, no disruptions from kids, and the parents didn\u2019t have to figure out a sitter and a place to put the sitter and kids far from home.  I\u2019ve long thought that this was a pretty great solution for child-free weddings.  The fact that the kids still get family time (just with their own generation) and get to enjoy a party that is much more enjoyable to them helps with convincing parents, I think.

Some couples don\u2019t mind, but others don\u2019t want to risk that. Why shouldn\u2019t couples have that choice?", "I missed the part where OP is letting pets attend the wedding.", "Because that\u2019s what family means.\n\nFamily means it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re old and need a wheelchair to help or young and have a shorter attention span, there is a place for you. You are welcomed and loved despite having normal human needs.\n\nKids learn how to behave in these contexts by being around adults with cultural expectations. At the last wedding we attended, my baby was fussy and another guest offered to help. The wedding before that, I took my friends\u2019 kids with mine to go goof off in another area so they could get some alone time. At another wedding, we told off some boys were causing trouble.\n\nBut weddings are the time when you learn how to do things - how to tie ties and match suits and do dances. And you learn how to celebrate your family members. \n\nAt the end of the day, learning to deal with the imperfections and risks of having children at your wedding is a crash course in the skills it takes to survive a marriage anyway.", "While I understand your point, I think you\u2019re assigning meaning where there isn\u2019t any.\n\nA child not being invited to a wedding doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t part of the family, it just means that particular family event isn\u2019t for them. \n\nFamily also doesn\u2019t mean free reign to overstep boundaries. The couple set their boundary (not wanting children at their wedding) and people aren\u2019t entitled to overstep that just because they\u2019re related.\n\nJust because your experiences with bringing children to weddings was positive doesn\u2019t mean that other people haven\u2019t had negative experiences with children at weddings."]}
