Depending on the agreement, you agreed to pay her and she found a loophole where you didn't specify \"don't try it on, don't alter it, and don't post pictures on socials\" and she's going to take that route and expect you cough up the money. You could also say that you expected anyone with even a modicum of social or cultural awareness not to make these malicious blunders and that she has effectively NOT delivered the dress as you specified because she altered it (changed the dress you wanted) and posted it (showed others the dress when a wedding dress is designed to be seen forts on the day).

That's major disrespect and perhaps you may have to re-evaluate your friendship.", "The waist alteration and posting it online are what makes this her friend's problem so I agree with you.\n\nThat's not OP's dress anymore.  She bought an unused, as new item which has now been worn, altered and publicly posted.  It's second hand now, possibly ruined and even if it's not it's going to cost more money to have it returned to its original state.\n\nIt's an expensive lesson for her friend, but her friend sounds like an incredibly selfish person.", "What guys are you hanging out with that are watching videos of ladies trying on wedding dresses?", "The rule about husband but seeing the dress until the wedding day is so outdated and silly", "OP purchased the dress from another bride (who ended up canceling her wedding).", "I think the point was she could get it picked up by a trusted (ha) friend who'd bring it to her, rather than paying for a random courier.", "A big and tall shop around here used to do that. I walked in one night and came out with a suit that had alterations done in several places. I was not expecting that, but it was awesome.", "In the past bridal shops seem to take forever on alterations.  But that could be changing as they need to compete more with online these day.", "But she bought it from a private seller\u2026..", "there's no such thing as a \"quick alteration\" on a wedding dress. i needed a hem shortened and it took almost a month and two fittings.\n\nOP is farming karma.", "Having purchased a wedding dress myself, and having assisted several friends and family through the same process, and having purchased dozens of formal dresses throughout my life, still no.

You can walk into any boutique and say, \"Hi I'm getting married in June. I'd like to try on dresses,\" and they'll help you out. You don't get the third degree trying on wedding gowns.", "This is the reason it's not everyone sucks. \n\nYeah, posting pics of herself in the dress is tacky and thoughtless, but it's something I'd get over for the sake of getting the dress I wanted after a discussion about consideration. I do think she should have taken the dress at that point. \n\nBut alterations?!?! AlTErAtIOnS! \n\nI just do not understand this friend AT ALL. It makes no sense. If friend is smaller than OP, then they cut out fabric and it can't be put back. If she's larger and it was let out, it's not as bad, but it's still changed the dress from what OP was buying and expected. Why on earth would anyone do that? \n\nOP is def nta with that one little crazy bit of information that tells us a lot about her \"friend\".", "Depends on the dress. I do sewing at home and can alter the waist on a dress within minutes depending on the style and how much needs doing. It might be a case of just taking in the side seams a little bit of it doesn't affect the overall look", "The alteration itself might not take a while, but bridal alterations shops (especially in-house ones) tend to be pretty overbooked so unless it's a small place or she got lucky with the project lineup, it can take a while before they're even able to do the change.", "I'm not the person you replied to, but I don't know, but I'd guess a lot for a wedding dress? Every time I've asked for it to be done on prom/homecoming dresses, the shops made it seem like it was just about impossible and that they'd have to redo the whole dress's structure to take 4-6\" off the waist (I had serious curves even at a young age, lol)", "Actually reading the post is usually pretty helpful \ud83d\ude44", "Do you not have any girl friends? I follow plenty of old school mates and current female friends on insta/snap.

If this were someone from a different culture than your own, and they had traditions regarding the handling of specific items for their ceremony for cultural or religious reasons, would you also tell them their cultural beliefs and traditions don't matter, or do you only bag on people who follow traditions from American culture?", "I think it was \"the shop had the dress for sale at a discount because the person that originally ordered it cancelled their wedding and no longer needed it\". OP did not purchase it from the previous owner, she got it from the shop.", "Another person wouldn't give a receipt and Di alterations", "Yep she wanted to save the money on shipping costs which makes sense", "The point is that it's fiction, and so not all the details line up.", "We went to a store at an outlet mall for my husbands suit for our wedding. It was a mom and pop store and they altered it in store the second we paid for it and just had us walk around a bit while they did them", "The shop that did my dress pinned it for alterations and when I went to pick it up found that I'd dropped two sizes from stress in the month before the wedding.  They were able to re-measure and redo the bodice in under 2 hours.  That dress had an incredible amount of beading on the bodice, but cutting a dress down is a lot easier than adding fabric.\n\nNot every shop has someone on staff that can make alterations like that on demand, but the ones that do are really incredibly skilled.\n\nAlso.... If the friend had the dress cut down to fit her, then she's basically ruined any chance OP has of getting it altered to fit herself unless OP is significantly thinner and shorter than the friend.", "Theres walk in alteration places near me.", "It's a shop that listed it cheap as their intended buyer cancelled her wedding, OP wasn't dealing direct with the other bride. I was confused when she mentioned it being altered at first cause i also thought it was direct from the bride that cancelled", "Really depends on where you go. I had to get mine hemmed, have the waist taken in, and get lace reinforced. It was done in 3 days.", "Another eldritch abomination whose very existence warps the fabric of reality and makes it impossible for anyone, anywhere, ever to have a different experience! From whence do you come, oh mysterious and powerful being, and how did you acquire the ability to alter our entire universe like this?!", "Lol, OK person who chooses weird hills to die on.

It does involve changing the shape of the panels of the dress. Up to 1\"-1.5\" could be done fairly easily without too much structural change.", "As someone who sews, it depends on the degree of alterations and the fabrics and structure involved. A general rule is it's recommended not to alter a garment more than 2-4\" die to the fact that it can negatively impact the fit and structure of the dress, on top of affecting the end performance. If you're not looking to seriously change the fit and look of the item, not to mention how the actual understructure of the dress is set up and how that may be changed by your alterations, then its a good idea to look for curvier patterned brands or designs that take better to your body type. Taking 4-6\" or more off the waist can very well be a quite serious alteration when you consider designs, draping, closures, and whatever genuine insanity serves to hold the dress together internally. It's possible, but is a big change. \n\nOP's friend likely didn't need as notable an alteration, which would help things along - though I do suspect that she was either supposed to be there for a while and/or hasn't even picked it up from alterations yet, those in-house places are always overbooked.", "It's a nice, fun thing for people to follow tradition like that but it's totally irrational and unbecoming to decide the entire wedding/dress is ruined because that particular ritual got ruined.
