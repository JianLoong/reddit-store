I was really grateful and happy, and I was even intending to gift her a $100 on top of the Uber rides to/fro the place I said I would reimburse as my token of appreciation.\n\nHowever, my joy turned to shock/horror/dismay/disbelief when I saw S's Instagram story showcasing her trying on MY wedding dress. \n\nI called her out for it, telling her I wasn't happy she not only tried it without my permission but posted it for the public to see. She didn't take it down even after a conversation we had about this. \n\nTo make matters worse, she admitted she collected the dress posing as me. Through an email bill later, I noticed that the dress had also been altered (wtf) on the spot, all without my knowledge or consent. \n\nWhen confronted, S nonchalantly stated that it was her \"one chance to try a wedding gown\" and insisted I should \"get over it\" and reimburse her the $900 she paid for the dress.\n\nMy wedding dress experience was entirely hijacked, I'm now hesitant to pay her back. This all happened yesterday and she reached out today to ask for the money back and told me \"to get over it\" because she \u201cneeds to make a big purchase tomorrow and it would help her cashflow\". \n\nSince she wants it so bad, she can now have it. \n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR\nFriend agreed to help me pick up a wedding dress where she's at and bring it back to where I'm based at.
