{"id": 6197, "submission_id": "100lgzv", "title": "AITA for telling my mom I'm never going to ask her to babysit again?", "selftext": "My husband and I haven't been baby-free in months. My husband is a SAH dad and I work a few hours a week but am mostly at home as well. Financially we are stable enough but not where we could afford daycare or a babysitter.\n\nAs every parent knows, a break from baby is much needed every once in a while. He's had a cold so extra cranky on top of entering typical toddler phases. Between bleeding ears and being touched out, our nerves are shot to say the least. I asked my mom at 11a if could she please babysit for 4 hours so we could have a break. She said yes.\n\nMy mom is our only family capable of babysitting within a 2 hour radius. She lives 15 mins from us. However, despite her constant assurances, she is *rarely* available. She never says no directly but will beat around until I say never mind. Yesterday I was *desperate.* Had a migraine, needed to clean, and just needed quiet for a bit. She insisted he have a nap 1st. Logical, agreed. He slept an hour so I let her know I was coming. She said ok, then called back and said she had to step out and she'd be back in a bit but I can bring him over because I had a key. I said I'd wait til she got back. That was at 12p.\n\nI called at 1 to ask if she was home. She said no, getting food. I said ok, I'd go in another hour. She said ok. At 2, I let her know I was heading her way. We actually get there at 3 (giving her leeway since she hadn't responded), she's still not home. I videochat her, she's at someone's house. I told her if she didn't actually want to babysit, she really could've said that. She says \"no, I *do* I just hadn't seen (her friend) all year so I stopped by to say hi and got caught up talking. I'm coming!\" So we waited.\n\nShe shows up at 4:30. I'm upset, migraine on 100, baby extra cranky, nothing accomplished. I politely let her know the time frame to do what we needed has passed because dinner and bedtime was coming and I still needed to get groceries so there was no point in her keeping him. I gathered his stuff to leave while she's sarcastically apologizing for taking too long, she'd already told her husband my son was coming and he wanted to see him when he got off work, just making it seem like wasn't a big deal.\n\nI turned and told her this was a complete waste of the day, I should've never asked her because she's unreliable, even in emergencies (which has happened twice where she's agreed to babysit then call within the hour for me to get him), and I won't ever ask her to babysit again because it's obvious she has no interest in doing so but would rather lead me on about it than outright say no. She gets offended and starts a tirade but I'm over it so I leave.\n\nLater she and her husband message me saying I was being harsh and she wants to be part of her grandson's life. I wasn't being fair. I'm wondering if I *was* being an AH because I upset at that moment... so am I the AH here?\n\nEdit: character limit got me, but I should add every time I say I'd save to find a babysitter, my mom would insist family needed to keep him. I kind of agreed due to the crap you hear about babysitters abusing kids and I know my mom wouldn't do that. I had money to pay her to keep him and she knew this, so this isn't a case of I want free babysitting from her.\n\nEdit: there's a few people asking about my husband and the work situation. My husband is disabled and he's had recent medical scares (the mentioned emergencies) that would not be good to leave him alone with baby for a typical full workday. We tagteam our son so we get individual mini breaks as needed at home, but there's never not a moment our son is not within our hearing or line of sight honestly. The bills and household/child necessities are covered, my working helps out with that as well. Overall, the reduced hours I work helps my family's needs but it doesn't constitute being able to do daycare. I don't ask for babysitting often at all because I realize he's ours and we chose to have him and we're happy to raise him. But again, a break every once in a while *is* needed. I've come to the conclusion we'll save up and try to plan so we won't burn out instead of relying on my mom.\n\nFinal edit: I truly appreciate the feedback and advice given here. I also realize I wrote a lot so it's understandable there are a few who've missed some points I've addressed while giving me their feedback. I apologize about that confusion. It was a lot going on and hard to compact necessary information. Using the advice given going forward, I know what to expect and what actions I need to take. Again, I really appreciate everyone taking the time to read and comment.

You said exactly what I would\u2019ve said. I\u2019m childfree and typically side with the family in these scenarios, but it\u2019s too far to tell someone you\u2019ll babysit over and over and then not be there when you say you will. There has to be a point where you decide you can\u2019t keep trying.\n\nETA: I knew some ppl would bring up \u2018not expecting free childcare\u2019, b/c it\u2019s something I typically say to ppl. However, I don\u2019t see that as the issue. You asked her, didn\u2019t demand to expect it and it doesn\u2019t seem to be something you ask of her often. Also, the issue here is more the fact that she wasn\u2019t there when she said she would be, not that you\u2019re complaining that she should be babysitting for you for free.", "NTA. You spent the day in limbo because she didn't stick to her word. Would have been better if she'd just said no. If she wants time with grandchild, she has to be reliable.", "NTA. She said she would. Then screwed around for several hours so she wouldn't have to. And it's apparently not the first time she's done this. \n\nTry to find someone else you can trust with the baby for when you need it. You can't depend on her.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother doesn't want to admit that she doesn't like babysitting as it sounds terrible. Given the gravity of the situation, her family should have come first but suddenly she needs to see a friend...\n\nShe could just say she doesn't want to babysit but keeps beating around the bush", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't want to babysit. She just wants to be seen to be wanting to babysit.", "NTA. It sounds like she either has no respect for your time, or doesn't want to babysit. Either way, not a reliable option. You shouldn't have to grovel to get her to babysit, especially for a few hours.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s yanking you around. If she doesn\u2019t want to watch him, just say so.", "NTA\n\nIf she has agreed to babysit, then obviously it needs to be done at the time it is useful, not 4 and a half hours after the initial agreed time.\n\nAlso AITA hates the idea of being able to rely on family, so be prepared for a bunch of people who are just furious at the idea that you'd expect a bit of help on occassion.", "NTA, I'm surprised you asked this many times. I would have stopped after the 2nd or 3rd time she did this", "NTA.\n\nYour mother has made it clear that she cannot be depended on to babysit by her actions not her words. \n\nPlease do not ever believe her again nor should you ever trust her with your child.\n\nYou may be interested in this sub r/justnomil..Not sure what is wrong with your mom if anything. But she is lying to you and that is a big red flag .\n\nFind a trusted babysitter so that when you need one you will know who to call..It could be another mother whose kids you watch from time to time.. You may want to join a mom's group..", "NTA. Some people\u2019s grandparents never loved them and their extended family couldn\u2019t stand their wretched parents and it shows. \n\nAs much as your mum isn\u2019t free childcare on tap, you were at breaking point. Not sure what people on this sub want you to do in the moment but thinking that your own mother, who\u2019s offered to help previously, would be able to help you out for four hours and not jerk you around for hours is reasonable. You\u2019re entitled to feel disappointed. I would too.", "NTA. If your mom said no and you were demanding I\u2019d feel different. But your mom has said she wants to babysit. You ask and she says yes. But then basically ghosts you so that it\u2019s no longer practical for her to babysit. She\u2019s saying no without saying it so she\u2019s not the bad guy. I think you need to acknowledge that. Save money for a reliable sitter. Maybe ask other parents you know for a recommendation (if you have parent friends). Or if you have a trusted friend with a kid you could swap babysitting with them. It may be stressful to find a sitter but once you do, it will be worth it.", "NTA.\n\nShe wants to be a part of his life but doesn\u2019t support you properly when you desperately need it.\n\nShe can\u2019t make any demands when she\u2018s not willing to step up in return.", "NTA. I'm sure a bunch of redditors who are all anti-children will choose to make 'you chose to have a kid so you're the entirety of the problem' the entire focus of their response and that's probably something that's already affecting you, but you KNOW people who do this to you over any issue are bad for mental health and blood pressure. \n\nI suggest you look up 'ask vs guess' families to get a sense of this if you're not familiar, but honestly, now she knows she hurt you, and I don't think she'll become any more reliable in general. I wouldn't even especially trust her with your kid.", "Nope NTA. She\u2019s unreliable and to be honest I would cut contact for a while.", "NTA. She insists family babysits and then makes excuses why she can't. Also, just because she is your mother doesn't mean you have to do what she says. Find a reliable babysitter or two. Most babysitters are perfectly decent; you only hear about the bad ones.", "NTA. She should just tell you she doesn\u2019t want to babysit.\n\nHowever, for your own sanity, you and your husband need to find a way to have some time away from the baby.", "NTA!\n\nYour mom is deluded.  She thinks that a babysitting request is for *her* benefit, not yours or the child's.  Unbelievably childish on her part.\n\nNot only are you right to never ask her again and to tell her that like you did, but you would also be right to reduce contact with her to almost nothing because it seems she'd be more of a burden than a help in other ways too.", "NTA! I babysit my toddler grandson every day and cannot imagine ever doing this or saying no. He just goes with me if I need to run errands lol.  Your mother doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s missing. Or maybe doesn\u2019t care, I dunno. At any rate, she\u2019s unreliable and not very loving so I don\u2019t blame you.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom seems all over the place. If she cares about being a part of her grandchild's life, she'd be in it. Simple as. \n\n\"Oh sorry, I have to go find a flux capacitor right this moment you've asked me to babysit him\" yeah no. It can wait. \n\nBut also, if you know she's like this, don't ask again.", "NTA", "NTA. Your mother obviously cannot be relied upon to keep her promises; you would be foolish to give her another opportunity to waste your day.", "NTA. She doesn't want to babysit. Fair enough. She thinks only family should babysit. None of her flipping business.", "NTA she isn't obligated to babysit but she IS obligated to simply *say no* instead of wasting your time", "Nta! I\u2019m sorry you felt like that feel grateful for my il my sil heard I was ill and overwhelmed with my at the time 16 month old she said I\u2019ll get my partner come get her and you have a hour nap then start on ur bit and I\u2019ll call ya in 3 hours (despite being 6months pregnant at the time herself)", "NTA your mum keeps saying she will do it, then she gets caught up in other stuff. Has she always been scatty like this? It might be that she wants to sit him but is also nervous about it so puts it off until you break and say forget it.", "NTA. She absolutely wasted your day. I have a family that refuses to babysit too. It\u2019s frustrating. But at least they don\u2019t string me along like that. They just say no and I stopped asking a long time ago. I don\u2019t blame you for being angry and hurt.\n\nETA: to be clear, you do sound a bit like you think your mom is required to babysit. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s your frustration with the situation or if you really feel that way. While I\u2019m sometimes frustrated with my family, ultimately it\u2019s not their job to watch my kid and I don\u2019t get upset with them about it.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mother sees:\n\n* OP and Husband have knowingly created a situation (and decided to bring a third member into their family) that results in only 12-15 hours/week of income coming in\n* OP consequently can't afford external babysitters and thus relies on family members for babysitting support (sometimes last minute, like today's request)\n* Husband (who apparently is home/available can has the capacity of caring for the child at least for 3 hours at a stretch) hasn't been asked or refused to care for the child to relieve OP during her migraine\n\nI am suspicious that:\n\n* Husband is not so disabled and is potentially lazy/uninvolved\n* OP has a history of requesting babysitting services (of a cranky child - hence the nap request) on short notice (like today) when Husband could have stepped up\n* OP has a history of excessive expectations of support from Mother \n* OP has a combative communication style (based upon how OP stuck around for Mother to get home just to have the opportunity to yell at her instead of peacing out when she realized Mother wasn't coming when OP wanted her to; there was no need for OP to stick around except for OP to have the satisfaction of yelling at Mother)\n\nTaken together, I posit that Mother is neither supportive of OP's decisions nor keen on babysitting at the drop of a hat. Instead of communicating that directly (perhaps this actually has been done, but OP is conveniently leaving it out), Mother is passive-aggressively sending the message and hoping OP will piece together the clues.

I ended up with multiple broken bones tripping over it. But I know my kid - for all his bursts of being utterly impossible, he\u2019s a good boy with a solid conscience, and he internalizes stress. He deserved to realize that this was the consequence of his actions, but I also knew he couldn\u2019t emotionally handle that - if he knew my injury was caused by his actions it would eat him up inside. So I blamed the cat. And the whole time I was on crutches he kept the floor proactively and scrupulously clear of every item. Kind of his way of apologizing for not doing what he should have earlier. The lie was a strategic decision based on knowing my kid\u2019s emotional state.", "You mean whew she constantly reassures her she wants to babysit?", "Yes.

The first time she asked I was stymied and then immediately my Dads favorite activity came to mind and I told her he was fishing.  She actually laughed and said of course she should have known that.  The story had to be repeated many times for a year or so until her mental state deteriorated to the point she told her attorney I was her Mother.  That was upsetting to me and angered my sisters, but the attorney found it sweet and stated I was the most stable person in her life, visiting daily, always making certain her needs and wants were taken care of.  Somewhere in the recesses of her mind she associated the care I provided to that of her Mother.  The explanation didn\u2019t make my sisters happy, but I was relieved.  The oddest thing was her attorney wanted an updated POA and her identifying me as her Mother was sufficient proof to the attorney I should AGAIN be given POA over her affairs.  The Manager of the facility acted as witness and absolutely agreed.  White Lies to provide peace and well being are a necessary part of life.  \n\nIn the reverse, a friends mother was the last sibling among 7 sisters.

This wasn't meant to be a '\"shame on her for abandoning her grandchild\" comment, although I can see how it can be interpreted like that. I should have expanded more. If she doesn't feel ashamed then she should push back against those trying to shame her. She made a choice. If others come at her for it with judgment,  then she either stands her ground and challenges them on their expectations of grandparenthood, or she legit feels like she made a wrong choice and chooses differently next time.

I started as a mother\u2019s helper around age 10 and would entertain the kids while the parents cleaned/showered/napped, or even ran errands with mom and baby. I ended up being a babysitter for most of those families when I got older; the kids loved having me babysit because they saw it as me coming over to play with them, and the parents knew me well at that point. Even with older babysitters, though, you can hire them a few times to babysit while you or your husband are home and can observe their behavior/interactions with your baby and decide if you are comfortable hiring them.", "I also was facing the same problem, so here is an algorithmic process: if a person cancels on you, and they don\u2019t shortly after set up an alternative date, even upon you asking them, they don\u2019t really want to see you at this moment/you are not a priority at this point.

Aunt's husband communicated to all of their friends that she'd rather be watching their grand-nephew than attending the party. And this would be a truer statement than the former because the Aunt made the choice to reneg on a prior commitment whereas the mom simply communicated she couldnt due to prior commitment.\n\nI imagine neither aunt or mom were actually in the wrong in this situation. I'm sure no harm or fould was intended by either party. Mom correctly thought she was fulfilling a prior commitment and Aunt thought she was being helpful to niece/newphew... Aunt's husband was just indelicate and overshared and in the process probably made both look bad depending on who you asked at the party... Cant really fault the aunt's husband either here but hopefully he's more aware of the consequences of oversharing specifics.", ">It's very simple to say. \"She is having a rough time, I mean, she just gave birth, and that's extremely difficult, but we're figuring it out.\" That's not a lie and also isn't airing out everyone's dirty laundry.\n\nSure but it's also \"not telling the truth\" in the way you described it in your comment. In OP's story husband could have easily just said \"She was attending to a family matter.\" there are miles and miles of ground between \"she flew to the congo to save orphans\" and \"She was babysitting her grandniece because her grandma would rather come to this party\" you can be tactful without lying.", "I didn't think, or mean to imply, that you thought your mother an asshole, I  was speaking of society expectations in general. Which I think tend to create bad situations: in the OP's situation, for example, obviously the mother doesn't want to babysit, but keeps saying yes. Maybe she is a people pleaser, maybe she is thoughtless and unreliable; but maybe she has internalized that a good woman, mother and grandmother of course wants to spend time with her grandchild and help her daughter, so she flails at saying no, even though she isn't up for babysitting.\n\nBut, frankly, I don't think these points are fair. Your mother was less willing to spend time with her grandson to do her daughter a (frivolous) favour than a woman who adores babies and probably has had much less alone  time with her great-nephew. Good for her, that doesn't show her up in my opinion, it just means the aunt prefers babies to parties, not that she is better in any way.", "But she wasn't attending to a family matter. She was at a party, so that would be a lie. In fact, she was specifically avoiding attending to a family matter in order to go to the party.  And the husband didn't say she'd rather go to a party than babysit her grand daughter, he said she was at a party. She retroactively got upset because she realized that it rightfully made it look like exactly what it was, that she chose a party over her granddaughter, and she didn't like it.

The rules say I'm allowed to ask my mom to babysit, it would even be rude if I didn't ask her first, actually. My mom could refuse to do it, because a prior engagement is valid - it's not really no, it's 'I totally would but unfortunately I can't'. My aunt is NOT a guesser and accepted.

No, instead you waited for her to come home and then packed up. The only reason for someone to wait for another person to come home in this situation is to make a dramatic exit and vent at the latecomer.

It sucks.", "She definitely doesn't. She also didn't want her husband to know. \n\nOP NTA", "The new grandparents who proclaim \"I'm not going to babysit, this is my time to enjoy my life\"? Fine, you have every right to do so.\n\nBut not building a relationship with your grand kids, although nothing in the future is guaranteed, don't be surprised if in 20 years time your kids and grandchildren never visit.", "That is one very important quality -- following the parents' wishes.  I understood early on that not doing as expected would not only limit the time we would see our grandchild, but it would strain the relationship we have with our child and partner.  Not following our sons' wishes would have eroded trust.", "That's great.  My children have decided not to have kids and have made or making steps to prevent it from happening.  Grandmothers who don't babysit don't know what they are missing.  I will be the aunt to spoil any baby I can now that I have no grandbabies to spoil.  I accept and support their decision but still grieving the loss.  I help out any couple needing some time to relax.   It's important and I know the lack of support for my family was part of my divorce.", "My older sister has four adult children and I have two adult children. When they were small, it was very common for me to have all four of hers, while she rarely had my two. I never minded, I\u2019ve always loved children, and my nieces and nephew were fantastic kids. One day, out of the blue, once the kids were all grown, my sister decided that she hated me, hated our mother, and hated my kids. She does not speak to anyone in our family. My oldest niece had a child who is now two. Guess who gets asked to babysit her grandson most of the time? And my sister is salty about it too. Oh well, I\u2019m not going to stop having Liam and now my niece is expecting again so I\u2019ll have another baby boy to love.", ">Yes, we could lie, but giving appropriate information is easier to keep straight.\n\nBut you did lie. Pretending the floor is wet when it wasn't is not being truthful. I understand why you did it but you've contradicted your own argument. \ud83e\udd37", "Thats just damn cruel. It hurts no one to play along with someone suffering dementia. A quick they've ducked to the shops ect that they forget in under 5 mins vs informing them of a truth that will crush them and possibly relive the trauma. \nI hate that people with your mindset on this are working with such vulnerable people. \nAlso you wouldn't be lying, in that person world, they are alive and well. Why would you tell an unnecessary truth that will only cause harm?", "It was the same way with my Grandma, who I was very close to.  My life as a little kid was pretty unstable and she had always been my rock.  When she started to lose her memory she started mistaking me for her daughter (my aunt) and calling me by her name, then toward the end, she thought I was her little sister (who had in fact long ago died).  At first it hurt that she had forgotten who I was, but eventually I came to understand how sweet it was that even though she couldn't remember the years when I was a child, she knew that I was some kind of family and that she loved me.", "Sorry I have self respect \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "See, I don\u2019t get that. My MIL loves my kids, but she lives so far away that she doesn\u2019t get to spend much time with them or babysit them. My mum on the other hand, has my youngest 3 days a week so I can work. She\u2019s even helped in emergencies. She\u2019s had my eldest two before she was in full time school. Never posted it on social media either. It\u2019s all for genuine love. It baffles me that some grandparents don\u2019t want to have that bond.", "Sorry if that came off as aggressive or personal to you. I just think it\u2019s a funny phenomenon on this sub that it is so often suggested for things that I don\u2019t think are anywhere near requiring it. But that\u2019s just my opinion, we are all free to have them! You\u2019re free to think of it as self respect, and I\u2019m free to think of it as a an overreaction when stopping asking her to babysit would suffice.", "Honestly, my mom never wanted kids and was relieved when we left. I get that. I'd even get just not having a relationship. No kid was ever harmed by not having a disinterested adult around. It's the big show that gets me. It's like she wants to be a grandma influencer or something.", "Certainly not personal lol. As you said, that\u2019s your opinion:) you\u2019re allowed to feel however you wish to feel. Her behavior is unacceptable and you\u2019re missing the bigger picture. That\u2019s how she treats her daughter, that\u2019s just one example. I have self respect and won\u2019t allow anybody to treat me that way especially when it\u2019s clear that her mother has zero respect for her. Blatantly obvious.", "My mom has some pretty strong narcissistic tendencies (my dad is the full blown narcissist) and I see it translate in the way she's a grandma. She plays favorites woth the grandkids and my kid is the least favorite so he gets the shit end of the stick. Our living 3 hours away makes it perfect for her to bitch about not seeing us and make a huge show when she does. My kid is my stepson, so she gets \"clout\" for \"treating him as her own\" but what others don't see is she doesn't; she just uses Facebook to look good. The reality is even though mu parents have been around since he was 2 (almost 10 now) they've only spent maybe 10 days total with him. But you bet she loves saying they see no difference, treat him the same, etc. \n\nMy parents won't travel 3 hours to see us but will travel for am entire day and night to see my sibling and their kids. But they're good at hiding the truth. They blame coparenting issues (his mom is a weekend mom by choice so tbh there's not many issues lol) but they're the real issue.", "Goodness, are you my sibling? If my sister had stepkids this could be an exact description of my mom, down to the 3 hour drive.\n\nNarcissism in parents is wild, isn't it?", "Ha! I have a sibling that lives a full day and night drive and my parents see them infinitely more than us (in 2022 I saw my mom 4x and my dad 3x--they're married; my sibling that lives that far spent 5 *months* with the, but my parents say I \"chose to move \" bit conveniently forget that my sibling did, and much further).\n\nIt really is. My dad is 100x worse, but he's uninvolved with the grandkids mostly so he barely registers for me with that shit."]}
