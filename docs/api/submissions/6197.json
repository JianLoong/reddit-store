{"id": 6197, "submission_id": "100lgzv", "title": "AITA for telling my mom I'm never going to ask her to babysit again?", "selftext": "My husband and I haven't been baby-free in months. My husband is a SAH dad and I work a few hours a week but am mostly at home as well. Financially we are stable enough but not where we could afford daycare or a babysitter.\n\nAs every parent knows, a break from baby is much needed every once in a while. He's had a cold so extra cranky on top of entering typical toddler phases. Between bleeding ears and being touched out, our nerves are shot to say the least. I asked my mom at 11a if could she please babysit for 4 hours so we could have a break. She said yes.\n\nMy mom is our only family capable of babysitting within a 2 hour radius. She lives 15 mins from us. However, despite her constant assurances, she is *rarely* available. She never says no directly but will beat around until I say never mind. Yesterday I was *desperate.* Had a migraine, needed to clean, and just needed quiet for a bit. She insisted he have a nap 1st. Logical, agreed. He slept an hour so I let her know I was coming. She said ok, then called back and said she had to step out and she'd be back in a bit but I can bring him over because I had a key. I said I'd wait til she got back. That was at 12p.\n\nI called at 1 to ask if she was home. She said no, getting food. I said ok, I'd go in another hour. She said ok. At 2, I let her know I was heading her way. We actually get there at 3 (giving her leeway since she hadn't responded), she's still not home. I videochat her, she's at someone's house. I told her if she didn't actually want to babysit, she really could've said that. She says \"no, I *do* I just hadn't seen (her friend) all year so I stopped by to say hi and got caught up talking. I'm coming!\" So we waited.\n\nShe shows up at 4:30. I'm upset, migraine on 100, baby extra cranky, nothing accomplished. I politely let her know the time frame to do what we needed has passed because dinner and bedtime was coming and I still needed to get groceries so there was no point in her keeping him. I gathered his stuff to leave while she's sarcastically apologizing for taking too long, she'd already told her husband my son was coming and he wanted to see him when he got off work, just making it seem like wasn't a big deal.\n\nI turned and told her this was a complete waste of the day, I should've never asked her because she's unreliable, even in emergencies (which has happened twice where she's agreed to babysit then call within the hour for me to get him), and I won't ever ask her to babysit again because it's obvious she has no interest in doing so but would rather lead me on about it than outright say no. She gets offended and starts a tirade but I'm over it so I leave.\n\nLater she and her husband message me saying I was being harsh and she wants to be part of her grandson's life. I wasn't being fair. I'm wondering if I *was* being an AH because I upset at that moment... so am I the AH here?\n\nEdit: character limit got me, but I should add every time I say I'd save to find a babysitter, my mom would insist family needed to keep him. I kind of agreed due to the crap you hear about babysitters abusing kids and I know my mom wouldn't do that. I had money to pay her to keep him and she knew this, so this isn't a case of I want free babysitting from her.\n\nEdit: there's a few people asking about my husband and the work situation. My husband is disabled and he's had recent medical scares (the mentioned emergencies) that would not be good to leave him alone with baby for a typical full workday. We tagteam our son so we get individual mini breaks as needed at home, but there's never not a moment our son is not within our hearing or line of sight honestly. The bills and household/child necessities are covered, my working helps out with that as well. Overall, the reduced hours I work helps my family's needs but it doesn't constitute being able to do daycare. I don't ask for babysitting often at all because I realize he's ours and we chose to have him and we're happy to raise him. But again, a break every once in a while *is* needed. I've come to the conclusion we'll save up and try to plan so we won't burn out instead of relying on my mom.\n\nFinal edit: I truly appreciate the feedback and advice given here. I also realize I wrote a lot so it's understandable there are a few who've missed some points I've addressed while giving me their feedback. I apologize about that confusion. It was a lot going on and hard to compact necessary information. Using the advice given going forward, I know what to expect and what actions I need to take. Again, I really appreciate everyone taking the time to read and comment.

You said exactly what I would\u2019ve said. I\u2019m childfree and typically side with the family in these scenarios, but it\u2019s too far to tell someone you\u2019ll babysit over and over and then not be there when you say you will. There has to be a point where you decide you can\u2019t keep trying.\n\nETA: I knew some ppl would bring up \u2018not expecting free childcare\u2019, b/c it\u2019s something I typically say to ppl. However, I don\u2019t see that as the issue. You asked her, didn\u2019t demand to expect it and it doesn\u2019t seem to be something you ask of her often. Also, the issue here is more the fact that she wasn\u2019t there when she said she would be, not that you\u2019re complaining that she should be babysitting for you for free.", "NTA. You spent the day in limbo because she didn't stick to her word. Would have been better if she'd just said no. If she wants time with grandchild, she has to be reliable.", "NTA. She said she would. Then screwed around for several hours so she wouldn't have to. And it's apparently not the first time she's done this. \n\nTry to find someone else you can trust with the baby for when you need it. You can't depend on her.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother doesn't want to admit that she doesn't like babysitting as it sounds terrible. Given the gravity of the situation, her family should have come first but suddenly she needs to see a friend...\n\nShe could just say she doesn't want to babysit but keeps beating around the bush", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't want to babysit. She just wants to be seen to be wanting to babysit.", "NTA. It sounds like she either has no respect for your time, or doesn't want to babysit. Either way, not a reliable option. You shouldn't have to grovel to get her to babysit, especially for a few hours.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s yanking you around. If she doesn\u2019t want to watch him, just say so.", "NTA\n\nIf she has agreed to babysit, then obviously it needs to be done at the time it is useful, not 4 and a half hours after the initial agreed time.\n\nAlso AITA hates the idea of being able to rely on family, so be prepared for a bunch of people who are just furious at the idea that you'd expect a bit of help on occassion.", "NTA, I'm surprised you asked this many times. I would have stopped after the 2nd or 3rd time she did this", "NTA.\n\nYour mother has made it clear that she cannot be depended on to babysit by her actions not her words. \n\nPlease do not ever believe her again nor should you ever trust her with your child.\n\nYou may be interested in this sub r/justnomil..Not sure what is wrong with your mom if anything. But she is lying to you and that is a big red flag .\n\nFind a trusted babysitter so that when you need one you will know who to call..It could be another mother whose kids you watch from time to time.. You may want to join a mom's group..", "NTA. Some people\u2019s grandparents never loved them and their extended family couldn\u2019t stand their wretched parents and it shows. \n\nAs much as your mum isn\u2019t free childcare on tap, you were at breaking point. Not sure what people on this sub want you to do in the moment but thinking that your own mother, who\u2019s offered to help previously, would be able to help you out for four hours and not jerk you around for hours is reasonable. You\u2019re entitled to feel disappointed. I would too.", "NTA. If your mom said no and you were demanding I\u2019d feel different. But your mom has said she wants to babysit. You ask and she says yes. But then basically ghosts you so that it\u2019s no longer practical for her to babysit. She\u2019s saying no without saying it so she\u2019s not the bad guy. I think you need to acknowledge that. Save money for a reliable sitter. Maybe ask other parents you know for a recommendation (if you have parent friends). Or if you have a trusted friend with a kid you could swap babysitting with them. It may be stressful to find a sitter but once you do, it will be worth it.", "NTA.\n\nShe wants to be a part of his life but doesn\u2019t support you properly when you desperately need it.\n\nShe can\u2019t make any demands when she\u2018s not willing to step up in return.", "NTA. I'm sure a bunch of redditors who are all anti-children will choose to make 'you chose to have a kid so you're the entirety of the problem' the entire focus of their response and that's probably something that's already affecting you, but you KNOW people who do this to you over any issue are bad for mental health and blood pressure. \n\nI suggest you look up 'ask vs guess' families to get a sense of this if you're not familiar, but honestly, now she knows she hurt you, and I don't think she'll become any more reliable in general. I wouldn't even especially trust her with your kid.", "Nope NTA. She\u2019s unreliable and to be honest I would cut contact for a while.", "NTA. She insists family babysits and then makes excuses why she can't. Also, just because she is your mother doesn't mean you have to do what she says. Find a reliable babysitter or two. Most babysitters are perfectly decent; you only hear about the bad ones.", "NTA. She should just tell you she doesn\u2019t want to babysit.\n\nHowever, for your own sanity, you and your husband need to find a way to have some time away from the baby.", "NTA!\n\nYour mom is deluded.  She thinks that a babysitting request is for *her* benefit, not yours or the child's.  Unbelievably childish on her part.\n\nNot only are you right to never ask her again and to tell her that like you did, but you would also be right to reduce contact with her to almost nothing because it seems she'd be more of a burden than a help in other ways too.", "NTA! I babysit my toddler grandson every day and cannot imagine ever doing this or saying no. He just goes with me if I need to run errands lol.  Your mother doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s missing. Or maybe doesn\u2019t care, I dunno. At any rate, she\u2019s unreliable and not very loving so I don\u2019t blame you.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom seems all over the place. If she cares about being a part of her grandchild's life, she'd be in it. Simple as. \n\n\"Oh sorry, I have to go find a flux capacitor right this moment you've asked me to babysit him\" yeah no. It can wait. \n\nBut also, if you know she's like this, don't ask again.", "NTA", "NTA. Your mother obviously cannot be relied upon to keep her promises; you would be foolish to give her another opportunity to waste your day.", "NTA. She doesn't want to babysit. Fair enough. She thinks only family should babysit. None of her flipping business.", "NTA she isn't obligated to babysit but she IS obligated to simply *say no* instead of wasting your time", "Nta! I\u2019m sorry you felt like that feel grateful for my il my sil heard I was ill and overwhelmed with my at the time 16 month old she said I\u2019ll get my partner come get her and you have a hour nap then start on ur bit and I\u2019ll call ya in 3 hours (despite being 6months pregnant at the time herself)", "NTA your mum keeps saying she will do it, then she gets caught up in other stuff. Has she always been scatty like this? It might be that she wants to sit him but is also nervous about it so puts it off until you break and say forget it.", "NTA. She absolutely wasted your day. I have a family that refuses to babysit too. It\u2019s frustrating. But at least they don\u2019t string me along like that. They just say no and I stopped asking a long time ago. I don\u2019t blame you for being angry and hurt.\n\nETA: to be clear, you do sound a bit like you think your mom is required to babysit. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s your frustration with the situation or if you really feel that way. While I\u2019m sometimes frustrated with my family, ultimately it\u2019s not their job to watch my kid and I don\u2019t get upset with them about it.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mother sees:\n\n* OP and Husband have knowingly created a situation (and decided to bring a third member into their family) that results in only 12-15 hours/week of income coming in\n* OP consequently can't afford external babysitters and thus relies on family members for babysitting support (sometimes last minute, like today's request)\n* Husband (who apparently is home/available can has the capacity of caring for the child at least for 3 hours at a stretch) hasn't been asked or refused to care for the child to relieve OP during her migraine\n\nI am suspicious that:\n\n* Husband is not so disabled and is potentially lazy/uninvolved\n* OP has a history of requesting babysitting services (of a cranky child - hence the nap request) on short notice (like today) when Husband could have stepped up\n* OP has a history of excessive expectations of support from Mother \n* OP has a combative communication style (based upon how OP stuck around for Mother to get home just to have the opportunity to yell at her instead of peacing out when she realized Mother wasn't coming when OP wanted her to; there was no need for OP to stick around except for OP to have the satisfaction of yelling at Mother)\n\nTaken together, I posit that Mother is neither supportive of OP's decisions nor keen on babysitting at the drop of a hat. Instead of communicating that directly (perhaps this actually has been done, but OP is conveniently leaving it out), Mother is passive-aggressively sending the message and hoping OP will piece together the clues.

However sometimes it is objectively the better choice. There was one incident where my strong willed one defiantly refused to clear a major mess he\u2019d left and we were at an angry stalemate. I ended up with multiple broken bones tripping over it. But I know my kid - for all his bursts of being utterly impossible, he\u2019s a good boy with a solid conscience, and he internalizes stress. He deserved to realize that this was the consequence of his actions, but I also knew he couldn\u2019t emotionally handle that - if he knew my injury was caused by his actions it would eat him up inside. So I blamed the cat. And the whole time I was on crutches he kept the floor proactively and scrupulously clear of every item. Kind of his way of apologizing for not doing what he should have earlier. The lie was a strategic decision based on knowing my kid\u2019s emotional state.", "You mean whew she constantly reassures her she wants to babysit?", "Yes. That's how we treated my grandpa and great grandma in the end. They were happy with the answers and would inevitably ask the same question an hour later so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it was better for them to be happy", "That\u2019s precisely the attitude I would take when dealing with my Mom when she was in the midst of dementia and in a memory care facility. She would tell me she hadn\u2019t seen my Dad in a few days, and ask if I knew where he was.  He\u2019d been dead for 30 years at that point.  The first time she asked I was stymied and then immediately my Dads favorite activity came to mind and I told her he was fishing.  She actually laughed and said of course she should have known that.  The story had to be repeated many times for a year or so until her mental state deteriorated to the point she told her attorney I was her Mother.  That was upsetting to me and angered my sisters, but the attorney found it sweet and stated I was the most stable person in her life, visiting daily, always making certain her needs and wants were taken care of.  Somewhere in the recesses of her mind she associated the care I provided to that of her Mother.  The explanation didn\u2019t make my sisters happy, but I was relieved.  The oddest thing was her attorney wanted an updated POA and her identifying me as her Mother was sufficient proof to the attorney I should AGAIN be given POA over her affairs.  The Manager of the facility acted as witness and absolutely agreed.  White Lies to provide peace and well being are a necessary part of life.  \n\nIn the reverse, a friends mother was the last sibling among 7 sisters. As dementia overtook her life she would often ask about one or another of them.  Each time it happened my friends sister would inform her they were dead.  Each time it was fresh, unrelenting grief, repeated over and over for 4 years.  It was heartbreaking and totally unnecessary.  A simple \u201cshe\u2019s on vacation\u201d would have sufficed and been accepted.  The sister defended her actions by insisting she was not a \u201cliar\u201d and held on to her mistaken belief the truth would help her Mom defeat dementia.  Instead she lived her last years in a constant state of grief.", "When I was getting my CNA license, I had a dementia resident who was mostly nonverbal and combative. One morning, I was feeding her and she started crying because she wanted her mom. We\u2019d been trained to do the memory support by talking with the residents, and in a case like this, ask about their loved ones they were talking about. So I was talking her through it, about her mom, she looked at me and called me mom. The nurse nearby yelled at her, told her that I wasn\u2019t her mom, and that her mom was dead. The resident started screaming really loudly, and thrashed a little bit. The med tech and another nurse had to calm her down and took her to her room so she could lay down to calm down. It absolutely killed me.", "Yes. That was what my friend\u2019s brother did when he died. Their mum was in memory care, and they didn\u2019t want to risk traumatizing her over and over, or worse somehow have it be one of the few things that \u201cstuck.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision they made lightly, but it was what worked for them."]}
