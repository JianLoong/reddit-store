My husband is a SAH dad and I work a few hours a week but am mostly at home as well. Financially we are stable enough but not where we could afford daycare or a babysitter.\n\nAs every parent knows, a break from baby is much needed every once in a while. He's had a cold so extra cranky on top of entering typical toddler phases. Between bleeding ears and being touched out, our nerves are shot to say the least. I asked my mom at 11a if could she please babysit for 4 hours so we could have a break. She said yes.\n\nMy mom is our only family capable of babysitting within a 2 hour radius. She lives 15 mins from us. However, despite her constant assurances, she is *rarely* available. She never says no directly but will beat around until I say never mind. Yesterday I was *desperate.* Had a migraine, needed to clean, and just needed quiet for a bit. She insisted he have a nap 1st. Logical, agreed. He slept an hour so I let her know I was coming. She said ok, then called back and said she had to step out and she'd be back in a bit but I can bring him over because I had a key. I said I'd wait til she got back. That was at 12p.\n\nI called at 1 to ask if she was home. She said no, getting food. I said ok, I'd go in another hour. She said ok. At 2, I let her know I was heading her way. We actually get there at 3 (giving her leeway since she hadn't responded), she's still not home. I videochat her, she's at someone's house. I told her if she didn't actually want to babysit, she really could've said that. She says \"no, I *do* I just hadn't seen (her friend) all year so I stopped by to say hi and got caught up talking. I'm coming!\" So we waited.\n\nShe shows up at 4:30. I'm upset, migraine on 100, baby extra cranky, nothing accomplished. I politely let her know the time frame to do what we needed has passed because dinner and bedtime was coming and I still needed to get groceries so there was no point in her keeping him. I gathered his stuff to leave while she's sarcastically apologizing for taking too long, she'd already told her husband my son was coming and he wanted to see him when he got off work, just making it seem like wasn't a big deal.\n\nI turned and told her this was a complete waste of the day, I should've never asked her because she's unreliable, even in emergencies (which has happened twice where she's agreed to babysit then call within the hour for me to get him), and I won't ever ask her to babysit again because it's obvious she has no interest in doing so but would rather lead me on about it than outright say no. She gets offended and starts a tirade but I'm over it so I leave.\n\nLater she and her husband message me saying I was being harsh and she wants to be part of her grandson's life. I wasn't being fair. I'm wondering if I *was* being an AH because I upset at that moment... so am I the AH here?\n\nEdit: character limit got me, but I should add every time I say I'd save to find a babysitter, my mom would insist family needed to keep him. I kind of agreed due to the crap you hear about babysitters abusing kids and I know my mom wouldn't do that. I had money to pay her to keep him and she knew this, so this isn't a case of I want free babysitting from her.\n\nEdit: there's a few people asking about my husband and the work situation. My husband is disabled and he's had recent medical scares (the mentioned emergencies) that would not be good to leave him alone with baby for a typical full workday. We tagteam our son so we get individual mini breaks as needed at home, but there's never not a moment our son is not within our hearing or line of sight honestly. The bills and household/child necessities are covered, my working helps out with that as well. Overall, the reduced hours I work helps my family's needs but it doesn't constitute being able to do daycare. I don't ask for babysitting often at all because I realize he's ours and we chose to have him and we're happy to raise him. But again, a break every once in a while *is* needed. I've come to the conclusion we'll save up and try to plan so we won't burn out instead of relying on my mom.", "created_utc": 1672585573, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100lgzv/aita_for_telling_my_mom_im_never_going_to_ask_her/", "score": 233, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said exactly what I would\u2019ve said. I\u2019m childfree and typically side with the family in these scenarios, but it\u2019s too far to tell someone you\u2019ll babysit over and over and then not be there when you say you will. There has to be a point where you decide you can\u2019t keep trying.\n\nETA: I knew some ppl would bring up \u2018not expecting free childcare\u2019, b/c it\u2019s something I typically say to ppl. However, I don\u2019t see that as the issue. You asked her, didn\u2019t demand to expect it and it doesn\u2019t seem to be something you ask of her often. Also, the issue here is more the fact that she wasn\u2019t there when she said she would be, not that you\u2019re complaining that she should be babysitting for you for free.", "NTA. You spent the day in limbo because she didn't stick to her word. Would have been better if she'd just said no. If she wants time with grandchild, she has to be reliable.", "NTA. She said she would. Then screwed around for several hours so she wouldn't have to. And it's apparently not the first time she's done this. \n\nTry to find someone else you can trust with the baby for when you need it. You can't depend on her.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother doesn't want to admit that she doesn't want/like babysitting as it sounds terrible. Given the gravity of the situation, her family should have come first but suddenly she needs to see a friend...\n\nShe could just say she doesn't want to babysit but keeps beating around the bush", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't want to babysit. She just wants to be seen to be wanting to babysit.", "NTA. It sounds like she either has no respect for your time, or doesn't want to babysit. Either way, not a reliable option. You shouldn't have to grovel to get her to babysit, especially for a few hours.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s yanking you around. If she doesn\u2019t want to watch him, just say so.", "NTA\n\nIf she has agreed to babysit, then obviously it needs to be done at the time it is useful, not 4 and a half hours after the initial agreed time.\n\nAlso AITA hates the idea of being able to rely on family, so be prepared for a bunch of people who are just furious at the idea that you'd expect a bit of help on occassion.", "NTA, I'm surprised you asked this many times. I would have stopped after the 2nd or 3rd time she did this", "NTA.\n\nYour mother has made it clear that she cannot be depended on to babysit by her actions not her words. \n\nPlease do not ever believe her again nor should you ever trust her with your child.\n\nYou may be interested in this sub r/justnomil..Not sure what is wrong with your mom if anything.

Some people\u2019s grandparents never loved them and their extended family couldn\u2019t stand their wretched parents and it shows. \n\nAs much as your mum isn\u2019t free childcare on tap, you were at breaking point. Not sure what people on this sub want you to do in the moment but thinking that your own mother, who\u2019s offered to help previously, would be able to help you out for four hours and not jerk you around for hours is reasonable. You\u2019re entitled to feel disappointed. I would too.", "NTA. If your mom said no and you were demanding I\u2019d feel different. But your mom has said she wants to babysit. You ask and she says yes. But then basically ghosts you so that it\u2019s no longer practical for her to babysit. She\u2019s saying no without saying it so she\u2019s not the bad guy. I think you need to acknowledge that. Save money for a reliable sitter. Maybe ask other parents you know for a recommendation (if you have parent friends). Or if you have a trusted friend with a kid you could swap babysitting with them. It may be stressful to find a sitter but once you do, it will be worth it.", "NTA.\n\nShe wants to be a part of his life but doesn\u2019t support you properly when you desperately need it.\n\nShe can\u2019t make any demands when she\u2018s not willing to step up in return.", "NTA. I'm sure a bunch of redditors who are all anti-children will choose to make 'you chose to have a kid so you're the entirety of the problem' the entire focus of their response and that's probably something that's already affecting you, but you KNOW people who do this to you over any issue are bad for mental health and blood pressure. \n\nI suggest you look up 'ask vs guess' families to get a sense of this if you're not familiar, but honestly, now she knows she hurt you, and I don't think she'll become any more reliable in general. I wouldn't even especially trust her with your kid.", "Nope NTA. She\u2019s unreliable and to be honest I would cut contact for a while.", "NTA. She insists family babysits and then makes excuses why she can't. Also, just because she is your mother doesn't mean you have to do what she says. Find a reliable babysitter or two. Most babysitters are perfectly decent; you only hear about the bad ones.", "NTA. She should just tell you she doesn\u2019t want to babysit.\n\nHowever, for your own sanity, you and your husband need to find a way to have some time away from the baby.", "NTA!\n\nYour mom is deluded.  She thinks that a babysitting request is for *her* benefit, not yours or the child's.  Unbelievably childish on her part.\n\nNot only are you right to never ask her again and to tell her that like you did, but you would also be right to reduce contact with her to almost nothing because it seems she'd be more of a burden than a help in other ways too.", "NTA! I babysit my toddler grandson every day and cannot imagine ever doing this or saying no. He just goes with me if I need to run errands lol.  Your mother doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s missing. Or maybe doesn\u2019t care, I dunno. At any rate, she\u2019s unreliable and not very loving so I don\u2019t blame you.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom seems all over the place. If she cares about being a part of her grandchild's life, she'd be in it. Simple as. \n\n\"Oh sorry, I have to go find a flux capacitor right this moment you've asked me to babysit him\" yeah no. It can wait. \n\nBut also, if you know she's like this, don't ask again.", "NTA", "NTA. Your mother obviously cannot be relied upon to keep her promises; you would be foolish to give her another opportunity to waste your day.", "NTA. She doesn't want to babysit. Fair enough. She thinks only family should babysit. None of her flipping business.", "NTA she isn't obligated to babysit but she IS obligated to simply *say no* instead of wasting your time", "Nta! I\u2019m sorry you felt like that feel grateful for my il my sil heard I was ill and overwhelmed with my at the time 16 month old she said I\u2019ll get my partner come get her and you have a hour nap then start on ur bit and I\u2019ll call ya in 3 hours (despite being 6months pregnant at the time herself)", "NTA your mum keeps saying she will do it, then she gets caught up in other stuff. Has she always been scatty like this? It might be that she wants to sit him but is also nervous about it so puts it off until you break and say forget it.", "NTA. She absolutely wasted your day. I have a family that refuses to babysit too. It\u2019s frustrating. But at least they don\u2019t string me along like that. They just say no and I stopped asking a long time ago. I don\u2019t blame you for being angry and hurt.\n\nETA: to be clear, you do sound a bit like you think your mom is required to babysit. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s your frustration with the situation or if you really feel that way. While I\u2019m sometimes frustrated with my family, ultimately it\u2019s not their job to watch my kid and I don\u2019t get upset with them about it.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She told me she had a party herself that night, no problem, so I asked one of my aunts next. My aunt was OVER THE MOON to be asked, came over early so we could get dolled up uninterrupted, told me it absolutely didn't matter what time we got home, and possibly spent the entire evening cooing at the baby.\n\nDays later I found out my mom was pissed at me - because my aunt happily canceled her presence AT THE SAME PARTY she was at because she'd rather babysit my son. Her husband is a bit socially clueless so just honestly answered where his wife was. My mother was embarrassed to be there instead of my aunt. She recognized the situation was not actually my fault, but it upset her that everyone knew someone else would rather babysit her grandson than her.", "NTA \n\nVery funny comment.\n\nMy MIL is amazing with baby.\n\nMy mom is not.

This sub drives me crazy about that. \nI\u2019m childfree, but I will always babysit for my siblings kids if I don\u2019t have previous plans. Because they\u2019re family. And I love them.

But if you say yes, then you need to follow through. Because once you make a commitment, basic social contract says the other party should be able to rely on you.", "When we had our 1st, his aunt offered to babysit at 2 months so we could do the infant CPR course.   Put him to bed with explicit instructions in case he started to wake up (eg quietly go in his room and put soother back in his mouth).  She calls us 30 minutes later and baby is screaming blue murder and asks us to come home right away.  He's still screaming when we get home. I spent 20 minutes calming him and get him to sleep right at the moment aunt decides to tell a loud story that includes a shriek.  Baby walks up again.  I suspect she woke him the first time as she'd been on the phone to her friend and let him get wound up before attending to him.\n\nThe 2nd time I asked was because I needed to have a medical procedure done.  Asked if she would come with me to stay with baby while I'm in the procedure room.  She cancels last minute.  I have to go by myself with baby.  Dr was not impressed.\n\nNEVER asked her again.   That was 25 years ago.\n\nI note that neither time I asked was so I could go do something fun or frivolous. \n\nNever had any family that would give us a break with babysitting which sucked when I saw friends who got an actual weekend away or my other SIL who got a whole week away when my MIL babysat her 3 kids.
