You were all saying what my uncle and some friends were saying to me but it\u2019s different hearing it from people who don\u2019t know me and aren\u2019t biased.\n\nAfter reading your comments I realised what the issue was. When I explain my family situation to people a lot of them (not close friends and immediate family) say the same thing \u00ab how lucky I am to have a bio dad who wants and agrees to spend time to get to know me \u00bb, \u00ab how gratefull I should be \u00bb.\n\nMy bio dad or his family never made me feel like that, but I guess that after hearing a lot of people saying it, it kind of got to me and I realised now that I was restraining myself to not disappoint him. I guess in my mind I had to work and be nice to have his affection because I did not deserve it (you can blame my bio mom for that). \n\nAnyway after realising that I also realised that I never told him and his parents how his GF was treating me and I also realised she was smart enough to do it when they were all out of earshot. \n\nI am a non confrontational person and I was scared to say everything at once to my bio dad, and I was afraid to not be abble to express properly everything I wanted to convay.\n\nI talked to my uncle about it and he proposed to made a appointment with a therapist to have a kind of family session so it would be easier for me to express myself. (We did it before in our family and it helped me a lot).\n\nWe talked about it to my bio dad and he immeadiately agreed. He could sense that something was off. \n\nAnyway during the session I kind of exploded ? I started talking and couldn\u2019t stop myself, at first I felt that it made no sense because I was saying everything and nothing at once but luckily the therapist helped a lot. We all had a very long talk and put everything on the table. My bio dad had no idea that it was this bad with his GF and he was really appalled and remorthfull for not realising it. \n\nSomething that angered him and my uncle a lot was the comment about me not lookin like my dad, which I never took notice of because it\u2019s true. My mom and uncle are half filipino, and I took everything from the filipino side except his dimples. Apparently the comments about me not being part of the family was because of my racial background, so yeah on top of everything she was racist.\n\nAll of this happened last month and since then he broke up with her, and I try to be more honest about what I feel without being afraid of what he thinks. He also proposed to continue family therapy if I feel like it would help me talk about certain topics. \n\nThis relationship is still a work in progress but honeslty I feel very good about it.\n\nAnd some of you asked, but yes my uncle adopted me when I turned 18. \n\nSo again thanks for all your help and your kind words. I was really expecting to be called an asshole when I wrote the original post.", "created_utc": 1667757484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynxcx6/update_aita_for_refusing_to_play_nice_to_my/", "score": 916, "replies": ["Yay!! Good for you! Congrats on new beginnings. Continue doing the work and things will get better and better over time!", "So happy for you! I\u2019m so glad to hear that your bio dad cares for you so much and is supportive. Wishing you all the best!!", "So, you saved yourself from an awful situation, your bio-dad and your relationship, and your bio-dad from continuing a horrible relationship, all by communicating. I hope that you know how brave that was and now have learned how powerful communication can be (but that it will always turn out that way, but it definitely won't if you don't try.)\n\nSo many hugs to you for doing the difficult, but right, thing. Hugs to your Dad (uncle, but that's semantics, he's done a great job raising you), and to your bio-Dad. \n\nI'm so sorry that your bio-mother and bio-Dad's ex have shown you such poor examples of maternal figures. I hope your grandma showed you what a mom was supposed to be like. I really hope that you know what you don't want in future partners (whatever genders). \n\nBest of luck to you and the family that you have chosen/choose. \u2764\ufe0f", ">remorthfull\n\nI definitely read that in my head with a lisp. Joking aside, happy to hear a good update OP! It sounds like your dad is really trying to build his relationship with you. Wishing for best!", "Yay!!!! I\u2019m so glad things are working out for you. You\u2019re surrounded by people that love you and have your best interests at heart. That\u2019s wonderful to see.", "What a phenomenal update. You\u2019ve put in so much work into your mental health so kudos to you for unpacking your emotions and leaning on your support system to help process and devise a path forward. Your story demonstrates that men can have healthy relationships where emotions are respected and communicated. And yeah, your dad and uncle are great, but you\u2019re pretty damn awesome too.", "You are so brave for telling your truth! \n\nIt sounds like your uncle/dad is an amazing person, and your bio dad really wants to do right by you.", "That's an awesome update to see! Your bio dad sounds like he truly cares about you. I find that the ones who not only agree to therapy but actually suggest it in the first place, are the ones who really want to make things work. Best wishes for you and your family!", "Remorthfull is the cutest spelling error I've ever seen.\nI'm so happy for you that your dad listened and that you have the support of your uncle! I hope things keep moving forward like that!", "I'm really happy for you and hope it'll get better and better \ud83d\ude0a", "Wishing you the best for the present and future. God bless your uncle. What a gem.", "This is a good update and I\u2019m happy for you. It sounds like your bio dad is genuinely interested in your well being and it\u2019s very good that he suggested to continue therapy.\n\nI hope things continue to be well and only get better.", "Congratulations - really that\u2019s a great outcome and I am thrilled that you were able to connect better with your father and to learn to communicate better through therapy", "Congratulations!  That's awesome!", "Nicely done OP! \ud83e\udd17", "Thanks to you, your dad cut a toxic person out of his life. Hopefully he meets someone who is kind and happy to have you in her life.", "YTA", "I'm so happy for you OP!\n\nIt sounds like your bio-dad is a stand up guy and I'm so glad that it's working out for you.", "Oh I feel this. I'm so glad how this turned out for you. I know how hard it is to face the fear of losing something if you express your true self and feelings. As a result, we negotiate and compromise ourselves to prevent losing that something. It's so much worse when everyone is telling you how lucky to have it. At that least that has been my experience. \n\nI doubt people would be saying it is lucky to have that relationship if they knew the tradeoff was having to deal with a abusive racist creep that was diabolically abusing you when no one was looking. I'm so glad your bio dad and Uncle were on your side and put you first. I'm even more glad that you put yourself first and got to tell the truth of your experience. You took good care of yourself and that can be so hard to do!", "Thats great it worked out so well. His ex is a snake. Sadly it seems like he has a type, if his now ex is like your mom. I just love how she put all the blame for you and her not getting on, on you.", "Still NTA. Happy to hear how well things are going. Good luck!", "Thanks so much for the update. Glad to hear that so many people care about you AND are acting in accordance with that.", "This is a great update! Good for you!", "I love this!", "Oh good for you!!!\n\nI\u2019m so glad you were able to have the therapists help to facilitate this conversation! It\u2019s absolutely normal to say everything at once like that, it\u2019s like when you bottle it up for so long it\u2019s like a dam breaking when you finally do speak, it all comes out in a jumbled, rushing, emotional torrent of a flood. It\u2019s good that you were able to get it all out and good for your dad and uncle for supporting you and listening!! Your dad made the correct decision to break up with his girlfriend, she was terrible and treated someone important to him terribly, that is not how a good and loving partner behaves. An important thing to remember going forward is *you* didn\u2019t make them break up SHE caused their breakup through her abominable behavior, you did absolutely nothing wrong", "Glad to hear so many people care about you and are acting accordingly.", "Dear old bio dad does seem to have a type though\u2026", "Lmao get out of here with that, how is OP the AH at all?"]}
