You were all saying what my uncle and some friends were saying to me but it\u2019s different hearing it from people who don\u2019t know me and aren\u2019t biased.\n\nAfter reading your comments I realised what the issue was. When I explain my family situation to people a lot of them (not close friends and immediate family) say the same thing \u00ab how lucky I am to have a bio dad who wants and agrees to spend time to get to know me \u00bb, \u00ab how gratefull I should be \u00bb.\n\nMy bio dad or his family never made me feel like that, but I guess that after hearing a lot of people saying it, it kind of got to me and I realised now that I was restraining myself to not disappoint him. I guess in my mind I had to work and be nice to have his affection because I did not deserve it (you can blame my bio mom for that). \n\nAnyway after realising that I also realised that I never told him and his parents how his GF was treating me and I also realised she was smart enough to do it when they were all out of earshot. \n\nI am a non confrontational person and I was scared to say everything at once to my bio dad, and I was afraid to not be abble to express properly everything I wanted to convay.\n\nI talked to my uncle about it and he proposed to made a appointment with a therapist to have a kind of family session so it would be easier for me to express myself. (We did it before in our family and it helped me a lot).\n\nWe talked about it to my bio dad and he immeadiately agreed. He could sense that something was off. \n\nAnyway during the session I kind of exploded ? I started talking and couldn\u2019t stop myself, at first I felt that it made no sense because I was saying everything and nothing at once but luckily the therapist helped a lot. We all had a very long talk and put everything on the table. My bio dad had no idea that it was this bad with his GF and he was really appalled and remorthfull for not realising it. \n\nSomething that angered him and my uncle a lot was the comment about me not lookin like my dad, which I never took notice of because it\u2019s true. My mom and uncle are half filipino, and I took everything from the filipino side except his dimples. Apparently the comments about me not being part of the family was because of my racial background, so yeah on top of everything she was racist.\n\nAll of this happened last month and since then he broke up with her, and I try to be more honest about what I feel without being afraid of what he thinks. He also proposed to continue family therapy if I feel like it would help me talk about certain topics. \n\nThis relationship is still a work in progress but honeslty I feel very good about it.\n\nAnd some of you asked, but yes my uncle adopted me when I turned 18. \n\nSo again thanks for all your help and your kind words. I was really expecting to be called an asshole when I wrote the original post.", "created_utc": 1667757484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynxcx6/update_aita_for_refusing_to_play_nice_to_my/", "score": 289, "replies": ["Yay!! Good for you! Congrats on new beginnings. Continue doing the work and things will get better and better over time!", "So happy for you! I\u2019m so glad to hear that your bio dad cares for you so much and is supportive. Wishing you all the best!!", "So, you saved yourself from an awful situation, your bio-dad and your relationship, and your bio-dad from continuing a horrible relationship, all by communicating. I hope that you know how brave that was and now have learned how powerful communication can be (but that it will always turn out that way, but it definitely won't if you don't try.)\n\nSo many hugs to you for doing the difficult, but right, thing. Hugs to your Dad (uncle, but that's semantics, he's done a great job raising you), and to your bio-Dad. \n\nI'm so sorry that your bio-mother and bio-Dad's ex have shown you such poor examples of maternal figures. I hope your grandma showed you what a mom was supposed to be like. I really hope that you know what you don't want in future partners (whatever genders). \n\nBest of luck to you and the family that you have chosen/choose. \u2764\ufe0f", ">remorthfull\n\nI definitely read that in my head with a lisp.

It sounds like your bio dad is genuinely interested in your well being and it\u2019s very good that he suggested to continue therapy.\n\nI hope things continue to be well and only get better.", "Congratulations - really that\u2019s a great outcome and I am thrilled that you were able to connect better with your father and to learn to communicate better through therapy", "Congratulations!  That's awesome!", "Nicely done OP! \ud83e\udd17", "Thanks to you, your dad cut a toxic person out of his life. Hopefully he meets someone who is kind and happy to have you in her life.", "YTA"]}
