You were all saying what my uncle and some friends were saying to me but it\u2019s different hearing it from people who don\u2019t know me and aren\u2019t biased.\n\nAfter reading your comments I realised what the issue was. When I explain my family situation to people a lot of them (not close friends and immediate family) say the same thing \u00ab how lucky I am to have a bio dad who wants and agrees to spend time to get to know me \u00bb, \u00ab how gratefull I should be \u00bb.\n\nMy bio dad or his family never made me feel like that, but I guess that after hearing a lot of people saying it, it kind of got to me and I realised now that I was restraining myself to not disappoint him. I guess in my mind I had to work and be nice to have his affection because I did not deserve it (you can blame my bio mom for that). \n\nAnyway after realising that I also realised that I never told him and his parents how his GF was treating me and I also realised she was smart enough to do it when they were all out of earshot. \n\nI am a non confrontational person and I was scared to say everything at once to my bio dad, and I was afraid to not be abble to express properly everything I wanted to convay.\n\nI talked to my uncle about it and he proposed to made a appointment with a therapist to have a kind of family session so it would be easier for me to express myself. (We did it before in our family and it helped me a lot).\n\nWe talked about it to my bio dad and he immeadiately agreed. He could sense that something was off. \n\nAnyway during the session I kind of exploded ? I started talking and couldn\u2019t stop myself, at first I felt that it made no sense because I was saying everything and nothing at once but luckily the therapist helped a lot. We all had a very long talk and put everything on the table. My bio dad had no idea that it was this bad with his GF and he was really appalled and remorthfull for not realising it. \n\nSomething that angered him and my uncle a lot was the comment about me not lookin like my dad, which I never took notice of because it\u2019s true. My mom and uncle are half filipino, and I took everything from the filipino side except his dimples. Apparently the comments about me not being part of the family was because of my racial background, so yeah on top of everything she was racist.\n\nAll of this happened last month and since then he broke up with her, and I try to be more honest about what I feel without being afraid of what he thinks. He also proposed to continue family therapy if I feel like it would help me talk about certain topics. \n\nThis relationship is still a work in progress but honeslty I feel very good about it.\n\nAnd some of you asked, but yes my uncle adopted me when I turned 18. \n\nSo again thanks for all your help and your kind words. I was really expecting to be called an asshole when I wrote the original post.", "created_utc": 1667757484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynxcx6/update_aita_for_refusing_to_play_nice_to_my/", "score": 4715, "replies": ["Yay!! Good for you! Congrats on new beginnings. Continue doing the work and things will get better and better over time!", "So happy for you! I\u2019m so glad to hear that your bio dad cares for you so much and is supportive. Wishing you all the best!!", "So, you saved yourself from an awful situation, your bio-dad and your relationship, and your bio-dad from continuing a horrible relationship, all by communicating. I hope that you know how brave that was and now have learned how powerful communication can be (but that it will always turn out that way, but it definitely won't if you don't try.)\n\nSo many hugs to you for doing the difficult, but right, thing. Hugs to your Dad (uncle, but that's semantics, he's done a great job raising you), and to your bio-Dad. \n\nI'm so sorry that your bio-mother and bio-Dad's ex have shown you such poor examples of maternal figures. I hope your grandma showed you what a mom was supposed to be like. I really hope that you know what you don't want in future partners (whatever genders). \n\nBest of luck to you and the family that you have chosen/choose. \u2764\ufe0f", ">remorthfull\n\nI definitely read that in my head with a lisp. Joking aside, happy to hear a good update OP! It sounds like your dad is really trying to build his relationship with you. Wishing for best!", "Yay!!!! I\u2019m so glad things are working out for you. You\u2019re surrounded by people that love you and have your best interests at heart. That\u2019s wonderful to see.", "What a phenomenal update. You\u2019ve put in so much work into your mental health so kudos to you for unpacking your emotions and leaning on your support system to help process and devise a path forward. Your story demonstrates that men can have healthy relationships where emotions are respected and communicated. And yeah, your dad and uncle are great, but you\u2019re pretty damn awesome too.", "You are so brave for telling your truth! \n\nIt sounds like your uncle/dad is an amazing person, and your bio dad really wants to do right by you.", "That's an awesome update to see! Your bio dad sounds like he truly cares about you. I find that the ones who not only agree to therapy but actually suggest it in the first place, are the ones who really want to make things work. Best wishes for you and your family!", "Remorthfull is the cutest spelling error I've ever seen.\nI'm so happy for you that your dad listened and that you have the support of your uncle! I hope things keep moving forward like that!", "I'm really happy for you and hope it'll get better and better \ud83d\ude0a", "Wishing you the best for the present and future. God bless your uncle. What a gem.", "This is a good update and I\u2019m happy for you. It sounds like your bio dad is genuinely interested in your well being and it\u2019s very good that he suggested to continue therapy.\n\nI hope things continue to be well and only get better.", "Congratulations - really that\u2019s a great outcome and I am thrilled that you were able to connect better with your father and to learn to communicate better through therapy", "Congratulations!  That's awesome!", "Nicely done OP! \ud83e\udd17", "Thanks to you, your dad cut a toxic person out of his life. Hopefully he meets someone who is kind and happy to have you in her life.", "[removed]", "I'm so happy for you OP!\n\nIt sounds like your bio-dad is a stand up guy and I'm so glad that it's working out for you.", "Oh I feel this. I'm so glad how this turned out for you. I know how hard it is to face the fear of losing something if you express your true self and feelings. As a result, we negotiate and compromise ourselves to prevent losing that something. It's so much worse when everyone is telling you how lucky to have it. At that least that has been my experience. \n\nI doubt people would be saying it is lucky to have that relationship if they knew the tradeoff was having to deal with a abusive racist creep that was diabolically abusing you when no one was looking. I'm so glad your bio dad and Uncle were on your side and put you first. I'm even more glad that you put yourself first and got to tell the truth of your experience. You took good care of yourself and that can be so hard to do!", "Thats great it worked out so well. His ex is a snake. Sadly it seems like he has a type, if his now ex is like your mom. I just love how she put all the blame for you and her not getting on, on you.", "Still NTA. Happy to hear how well things are going. Good luck!", "Thanks so much for the update. Glad to hear that so many people care about you AND are acting in accordance with that.", "This is a great update! Good for you!", "I love this!", "Oh good for you!!!\n\nI\u2019m so glad you were able to have the therapists help to facilitate this conversation! It\u2019s absolutely normal to say everything at once like that, it\u2019s like when you bottle it up for so long it\u2019s like a dam breaking when you finally do speak, it all comes out in a jumbled, rushing, emotional torrent of a flood. It\u2019s good that you were able to get it all out and good for your dad and uncle for supporting you and listening!! Your dad made the correct decision to break up with his girlfriend, she was terrible and treated someone important to him terribly, that is not how a good and loving partner behaves. An important thing to remember going forward is *you* didn\u2019t make them break up SHE caused their breakup through her abominable behavior, you did absolutely nothing wrong", "[removed]", "Dear old bio dad does seem to have a type though\u2026", "Lmao get out of here with that, how is OP the AH at all?", "I am really pleased to hear how well everything worked out for you. A loving and caring 'Dad' (your uncle) and a bio father who is concerned enough about you to kick his g/f who was harmful to your mental health to the curb.\n\nGood luck to you and all the best for the future.", "That\u2019s awesome that your dad loves you so much and genuinely wants you to be a part of his life", "This is great news, happy that things are going well for you! :D", "A thought i had a moment ago, you probably saved him from an abusive relationship. She was trying to isolate him by getting you to go away.", "You have a good adoptive dad and a good bio dad. I\u2019m so glad everything is working out for you!", "Aren\u2019t those moments of realizing what you believe wild? I have been the sole resident of my own mind for 35 years, but every once in a while I have a thought and realize I believe something that is obviously not true and have been letting this crazy unconscious belief guide my behavior.", "Love a happy update.  This is certainly not the ending and with the work you and bio dad and uncle are putting in, I see nothing but happy results.\nGood luck.", "I'm doing a happy dance for you and all the positive loved ones you have in your life", "Your bio dad has awful taste in women. Hope his next partner is the complete opposite.", ">\tYou saved yourself from an awful situation, your bio-dad and your relationship, and your bio-dad from continuing a horrible relationship, all by communicating. I hope that you know how brave that was\n\nHear, hear!! Healthy communication is *incredibly* powerful. It\u2019s so refreshing and faith-restoring to hear about a situation resolved so wonderfully, all because of good communication. Great work OP!", "Take my free award for eloquently saying everything I wanted to, and more! \n\nOP, opening up the flood gates of emotions like that took a lot of courage, especially when it's the complete opposite of your normal behavior. I adore how supportive your uncle has been, and how much your bio-dad wants you in his life. He wants you to always feel welcome and safe, which is something you absolutely deserve.\n\nOP, I'm a big proponent of therapy, as I think most of us could benefit from a little guidance and insight at one point or another in our lives. I'd like to gently encourage you to see a therapist. You've been through so much already in your life. You appear to do well opening up, so I really think you'd benefit. As you've seen, good communication skills are a huge asset, and will benefit you for the rest of your life. \n\nI wish the best for you and your family \u2764\ufe0f", "I'm glad it seems to be working out for you.\n\nAlso it seems like your bio dad has a type. Hopefully now that everything is out in the open he will realize what to look out for with women in the future!", "Glad the racist gf is now the racist ex-gf! Even more glad that your dads seem to care so much about you! That's wonderful and I wish you and your family the best!", "All the feels! What a positive path you are on now.", "So very happy for you! Wonderful to know your dad is in your life. Best wishes to you all for a happy future", "Oh great, now I'm shipping your BioDad and your Uncle.", "I am so happy for you, OP. You deserve to be loved. And kudos to the two fathers who care about you. \ud83d\udc97", "I\u2019m glad bio dad had his priorities straight and threw the whole girlfriend away. \n\nSomething is nagging at me though\u2014your bio dad never suspected he was your father? Mom said it was a summer fling, but he has to know he was that summer fling, or at least one of them?", "Thanksgiving came early for you\u2026. Very glad to hear how it all turned out.", "I am so glad your dad agreed to go to this therapy session with you, I'm so glad things have gotten better for you, I hope they get even better", "I never got to have a relationship with my bio dad before he passed but I\u2019ve been told he was looking forward to me reaching out when I got old enough. Reading how your father has been so willing to be there for you and support you honestly makes me tear up. I\u2019m so happy you get to have a relationship with him. Cherish it!", "Awwww thank you so much for your update. Im soo glad you were able to do family therapy and talk to your bio dad that way and he listened to you. Definitely continue with it if it helps", "I'm so glad you decided to speak up, that your dad was more than willing to listen and that your uncle is such an awesome guy! You got dealt a very very difficult hand in life, I'm just happy that you've got some amazing people in there to help you stand against the shite people.", "Comment thief bot.\n\nStolen from /u/partanimal below.", "I\u2019m so sad you didn\u2019t get to have a relationship with your bio dad growing up. He seems like a good dude with a good heart and that\u2019s always wonderful to see.", "Super happy for you that your dad and uncle both participated in the family therapy. That is so awesome!!!", "I'm so happy for you.  Your Dad is an amazing man and by Dad I mean of course your Uncle.  Your Bio \"Dad\" is really trying to do right and if he continues with therapy, etc- please give him a chance.  Consider how old he was when you were born.  It's not an excuse - it's an understanding.", "Me too - this is exactly what I would have written.", "Third times the charm?", "Aw this is so sweet! Keep on with this stuff OP", "Wow! Thank you for this!", "Thanks for the update! Happy for you!\n\nI call that \"explosion of words\" that you experienced \"word vomit\" \ud83d\ude0a that way it doesn't sound like I was angry but rather just had a lot to say\\work through \ud83d\ude0a", "I missed the original post, but this update is lovely. So glad  that your uncle and bio dad have your back. They both seem like good people. And you...you did such a brave thing opening up like that. Good job all round!", "Yes I'm so glad to read this update!! Good on you for having expressed all your feelings and anger. \n\nKudo's to your uncle dad and bio dad for being such good people to you and recognising what was wrong in the relationships they've had with the ex GF and with you. That must've been tough on your bio dad, but he did the right thing.\n\nI wish you all the best in your future with renewed happy family dynamics!", "yay happy ending", "Ah great to hear. You did good. Hug!", "I love happy endings!", ">So again thanks for all your help and your kind words. I was really expecting to be called an asshole when I wrote the original post.\n\nOP, please stay in therapy because you need to realize your self worth.  Reading your original post, I don't know how anyone could think you are TA.  And I hate that you thought you were.  You weren't.   Not even a little.", "I love your uncle. So glad he was in your life.", "Sending healing thoughts!\n\nI'm so proud of you for speaking up to your biodad!!!   \n\nCounseling can help your communication and help build your relationship.  It can also help you learn how to have  healthy relationships in the future.  \n\nTake care of yourself!", "I'm so happy for you! I'm really impressed that your uncle has the emotional intelligence and maturity to help facilitate your relationship with your bio dad. Maybe I've been reading too many AITA posts, but not everyone has that sort of influence in their lives, and I'm happy you have it!", "Congratulations!  I\u2019m in my 50s and still working on communication skills. If I was where you are at your age my life would have been a lot easier (I still have a good life but I think yours will be better in this area.)", "I'm really glad to hear that you're in therapy and working out the issues that were there.\n\nAnd that your bio dad dumped the toxic girlfriend.", "Wow thank you for this update.  I'm glad your bio dad is taking the time and effort to make you comfortable and props to your other dad for being so damn supportive.", "So, so, so proud of you! I\u2019m happy that things are going well with your bio dad, you deserve to be happy, and I hope the communication is able to stay open between the both of you!", "Why would and how did your uncle adopt you at 18?
