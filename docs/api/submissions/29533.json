He was out at work and his in-laws were there when I arrived. \n\nAfter a while, the little guy got hungry and Eleanor wanted to breastfeed him. I got up to leave the room and let her be comfortable but she asked me to stay. She told me her nipple was sore and asked me to take a look. \n\nNow I am not an expert on breastfeeding and it has been a while since I last read about it but I know and certainly can help manage a simple cracked nipple. I helped with positioning the baby, and the breast and gave her a few tips on how to manage the situation.\n\nWhen Mike got home Eleanor told him she had asked me for advice about the problem she had with her breastfeeding. Mike got extremely uncomfortable but didn't say anything at the moment. \n\nHe pulled me aside once I was leaving and told me to back the F-off from his wife, and reminded me rather rudely that his wife was off limits for me. He said I should have respected Eleanor and not jumped at the chance of seeing her body like I did. For the record, I am homosexual.\n\nI told him that Eleanor asked me for help, and that I was ready to leave the room to make her more comfortable, but he said he knew me better than that, and that I was an AH for seeking Eleanor out like this.\n\nI honestly didn't think much of what hapoened but after seeing Mike's obvious anger, I wonder if I did something wrong and if I should apologise to keep the peace between us. Thanks for your time. I would really appreciate your input.\n\nEdit: By the way I'm an ENT doctor.

It is just insane that women can't freely breastfeed in public. I was asked but to breastfeed my son in a restaurant once, because some of the diners were offended by it.

It looks lime you need help with that.  Just let SIL help you.  & then you guys go at it while baby is feeding?  Is he 13 years old?", "NTA first of all, she trusts you.

I went home with my son and he wasn\u2019t latched on properly. Fast forward a week and I knew something was wrong, called the doctor and they put me off. My son was dehydrated and his kidneys were shutting down. We spent a week in the ICU. A week. I was informed I wasn\u2019t the first and it happened more often than you would think. I didn\u2019t know. There was no one to ask for help. If there had been I wouldn\u2019t have cared if they were male, female or non binary- I would have been so happy for the help.

NTA", "OMG the edit about you being a doctor was like the most crucial bit of icing on this insane cake.\n\nNTA, and I'm a little concerned for Eleanor. Your brother sounds jealous, prejudiced and controlling that his wife asking his sister the doctor (!) for help with a medical problem should lead to accusations of the dr trying to inappropriately touch his wife. Did he force Eleanor to give birth at home bc he didn't want any of the male OB-GYN's to see her private parts?\n\nWithout more context or some history (does OP have some history of seducing brother's gf's?) this makes no earthly sense.", "NTA. Wtf is up with Mike? Eleanor asked you for help because of your status as an ENT doctor. Are you hotter than Mike by any chance? Is Eleanor bisexual? If the answer to the second question is no then Mike needs to downright calm down. If its yes, then Mike needs to grow up.", "lol, ask any BF mum and they will tell you that boobs lose all sexual appeal once they start feeding your child.\nYour brother is being weird. They literally exist to feed his baby\nAsk him if he would react like this if she had asked you to help the baby latch onto a bottle nipple or advice with starting solids. It\u2019s about nourishment for babes, not dem tiddies \ud83c\udf48\ud83c\udf48\n\nSecondly, his comments act like queer people are sexual deviants who will fuck anything that has the required genitals, which is absurd and kind of homophobic.\nMaybe you should steal his girl just for shits and giggles \ud83e\udd2d \n\nNTA", "NTA OP.
