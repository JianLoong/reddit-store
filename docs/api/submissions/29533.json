I will try and keep this short and use fake names.\n\nMy brother (Mike 34) and his wife (Eleanor - 28) just had their first baby last week. So I (29F) became an aunt for the first time! And I was beyond excited and happy to meet my nephew.\n\nI have an extremely ridiculous schedule thanks to my job. Despite that, I managed to go to Mike's for a visit yesterday. He was out at work and his in-laws were there when I arrived. \n\nAfter a while, the little guy got hungry and Eleanor wanted to breastfeed him. I got up to leave the room and let her be comfortable but she asked me to stay. She told me her nipple was sore and asked me to take a look. \n\nNow I am not an expert on breastfeeding and it has been a while since I last read about it but I know and certainly can help manage a simple cracked nipple. I helped with positioning the baby, and the breast and gave her a few tips on how to manage the situation.\n\nWhen Mike got home Eleanor told him she had asked me for advice about the problem she had with her breastfeeding. Mike got extremely uncomfortable but didn't say anything at the moment. \n\nHe pulled me aside once I was leaving and told me to back the F-off from his wife, and reminded me rather rudely that his wife was off limits for me. He said I should have respected Eleanor and not jumped at the chance of seeing her body like I did. For the record, I am homosexual.\n\nI told him that Eleanor asked me for help, and that I was ready to leave the room to make her more comfortable, but he said he knew me better than that, and that I was an AH for seeking Eleanor out like this.\n\nI honestly didn't think much of what hapoened but after seeing Mike's obvious anger, I wonder if I did something wrong and if I should apologise to keep the peace between us. Thanks for your time. I would really appreciate your input.\n\nEdit: By the way I'm an ENT doctor. Not exactly ideal for breastfeeding problems but I do remember enough from back in med school to manage a simple cracked nipple.", "created_utc": 1698094710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17euxox/aita_for_helping_my_sister_inlaw_breastfeed/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Actually maybe you both should sit him down and give him an education on non-sexual nudity and the actual real differences between lesbians and men when it comes to expressing/feeling attracted to women.

We used to be surrounded by our mothers, aunts, older cousins, older sisters, and other older, more experienced women so that when we had issues we could go to them for help and advice, but so many of us have lost that \"village\".

Probably at least a couple dozen saw me breastfeeding in the hospital per kid. Trust me, the lunch guys were not trying to look at that, lol. It is not sexy, there is a baby on it. And especially when you are learning you need to see to latch and re-latch that baby. Personally I breastfeed uncovered all over the place. Covers are hot. Lol, one time I was at the pool with my extended family. Of course I was in the corner and facing away from everybody. (No breastfeeding mother is trying to show people breasts) My mom called me to get my towel. Obviously, busy. Unbeknownst to me my cousin's husband went and fetched it for me and brought it over. He had no idea what I was doing until he brought the towel to me. I can't remember what he said (more in a oh no, unexpected booby kind of way, nothing insulting) but his wife immediately yelled at him \"What's the big deal?
