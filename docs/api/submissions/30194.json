I thought she would help me with some of the planning but she didn't seem to want to hear about it and would often change the subject. I just figured she wanted her space since she has been single for a long time and most her friends were getting married. \n\nI had to basically beg her to come dress shopping with me, and she really didn't say anything during that time. Then Bridesmaid dress try on's which she showed up extremely late and hung over and just had a bad attitude the entire time. The entire appt turned into comforting her by both my sister and I. \n\nMy first Bridal shower comes around and she texts me a week before telling me she can't come. Which was really heart breaking and somewhat embarrassing. I only have 2 Bridesmaids so it was very noticeable. I texted May about how much I wanted her there and how hurt I was. She confirmed she would make it work. \n\nThe week before the second shower I get a text saying sorry, I can't come. My sister ended up planning the whole thing by herself which they were orginially supposed to do together. Then my bach party also fell on my sister as well. May helped a little but it was mostly my sister and I had to beg May to help. But she showed upright? That's all I asked of her.\n\nAt this point I felt like she wasn't doing what we had agreed on for MOH duties and felt my sister deserved it more. My sister never failed to show up and continued to go above and beyond for me every step of the way. \n\nI decided to confront my friend as something clearly seemed off. I asked if she even wanted to be in the wedding to which she said yes. I decided to give it some thought before I broke the news that I don't think she should be my MOH and that conversation didn't feel like the right time.\n\nLeading up to the wedding, I kept trying to get together with her so we could talk in person, but she kept making excuses and would cancel last minute.\n \nSuddenly it was the day before the wedding and I wasn't 100% sure if she would show up. But she did and I had asked her to help me get ready before the rehearsal in the hotel, but she said she was running late and couldnt. \n\nAt the rehearsal Dinner, everyone started lining up and she went right next to me orginially. I had to say no it's actually my sister and best man, then May and our groomsman. She looked at me hurt, but didn't say anything and we proceeded to the dinner. She was very quiet throughout the dinner. But the wedding went off with no drama.

You are very weirdly insistent at only telling her in person, in the age where phone calls, texts(which you have clearly been doing with her leading up to this and had no excuse not just text her she was not MOH anymore), video calls, etc\u2026..and I\u2019m not sure WHY you were so focused on only telling her in person, considering she was *repeatedly canceling to the bridal stuff several times*, and was still canceling leading up to the rehearsal, so it\u2019s very confusing to me why you were still trying to meet up with her and tell her that way when that was clearly never going to happen.\n\nYou should have just texted or called her and it would have been over. Instead you humiliated her during the rehearsal which was a cruddy thing to do. She didn\u2019t deserve to be MOH, but she DID deserve for you to just use your words and tell her LONG before the rehearsal and you did NOT need to tel her only in person.", "When she performed no MOH duties or supported you in the way one would expect, she kind of removed herself from that position, didn't she?  However, springing that on her at the rehearsal dinner was a bit much.  A conversation over text would have been better than putting her in the spot that you did.  ESH", "NTA\n\nI really do believe in being kind, and in most situations, I am. But May didn't concern herself with your feelings at any point leading up to your wedding. And most likely, if you had been able to talk with her or text, she would have made you feel horrible and possibly let her continue as moh, or she would have just not shown up as the bridesmaid. \n\nFor all the offenses she made to you as your moh, she really did get exactly what she deserved. \n\nAnd it's nice to hear about sisters being sisters. You did the right thing concerning your sister. She deserved the title she earned.", "NTA-everyone handles things/issues differently and the fact you did try and she was always unavailable \u2026. With as many times as you tried i mean she pretty much left you no choice but to make a decision last minute\u2026.", ">I never had the opportunity to speak with her and didn't want to have that convo over text\n\nI know the younger generation doesn't like to make phone calls, but sometimes it's necessary. Also, two bridal showers and a bach party?\n\nESH", "ESH you should have confronted her about her behavior early on. If someone is dodging you then you tell them via phone or text. It was clear a long time ago that you needed to do something and waiting made it so much worse.", "ESH she did everything but send up smoke signals that she wasn\u2019t up for the MOH role but you somehow were unable to tell her until a crowd was assembled. Neither one of you can communicate.", "ESH.\n\nEven a text would have been better than springing it up on her on the rehearsal dinner.", "YTA \nNo for changing MoH but for how you handled it very last minute.

It sounds like she really stepped up.\n\nThat said, you should think about whether you've been a good friend to \"May\" here and that's a separate question. I wouldn't say your expectations for your MOH were wildly unreasonable but it sounds like you expected 2 bridesmaids to plan at least one shower (or maybe both??) PLUS a bachelorette party. That's a lot to put on two people!\n\nWere you spending time with your friend separate from wedding-related events, where talk of wedding planning was absent and you were instead focused on catching up on other topics? If not, you may have missed an opportunity to hear about things going on in her life that may have contributed to her not showing up for you as you had hoped.\n\nETA: The way you communicated that she was no longer MOH was not great, though. Any other way of communicating her \"demotion\" less publicly would have been ideal (text, phone call, etc.) Definitely consider offering an apology in respect to that, if you want to try to salvage the friendship.", "NTA.   Your wedding and your choice, but also her behavior  through much of this. I don't care if she's upset about being single, agreeing to play a specific role in the wedding party means you show up without being cranky/hungover/etc", "NTA idk what she had going on but it was an event and time that was supposed to have been about you not her. numerous times she let you down so you did the right thing", ">Leading up to the wedding, I kept trying to get together with her so we could talk in person, but she kept making excuses and would cancel last minute.\n\nNTA In hindsight, it would have been better to send her a text, but you were trying to tell her in person out of consideration for her and she made that impossible right up until the last minute, because she let you down right to the last minute.", "ESH. She should have showed up or better communicated her availability. If she said she was going to be places, she should have been. If she couldn\u2019t make that commitment, she should have told you.  But man, two bridal showers? Help you plan your wedding? It\u2019s nice if people have the time for that but I wish all brides would start to realize being in a wedding is not a job and they aren\u2019t required to do these things. \n\nRegardless, you are an adult. You should have been direct with her and told her \u201cI expect X, Y and Z or I need you to step down.\u201d You had a prime opportunity to do so when you asked if she even wanted to be your MOH. Instead, you waited until the day before the wedding and did it in front of everyone. That was unnecessarily harsh for something you could have taken care of well in advance.", "ESH", "ESH.

You strung this along as badly as she did.", "NTA.", "INFO: \"At this point I felt like she wasn't doing what we had agreed on for MOH duties and felt my sister deserved it more.\"\n\nDid she actually specifically agree to your itemized list, or did she just nod when you told her it would be lots of work?\n\nIf she had already completely agreed like you claim, you'd have called her out when she was flaky. Since you did not do that, it gives the impression that this \"agreement\" is anything but.", "NTA. her behavior sucks. You did try to reach out and she didn\u2019t show up.

Don\u2019t be surprised when she either ghosts you completely or asks why\u2026.and when she asks why, you need to list every single little thing that she failed on or to do.

Just for all of that, you're an asshole. As far as her evading you, I can completely see why she did it. But, the both of you should have been much more open and honest with each other.

I actually think the person you really owe an apology to is your sister. I kind of get holding out hope that May would pull through, but you should've had the convo with her way earlier and assessed what she was able to do.

Always!!!\n\nWhereas on the opposite end of the scale, you have conflict-avoidant shilly-shallying around right up until the day before the wedding to blind-side someone in a publically humiliating way, which seems like a sure-fire way of hurting them as much as possible, with a side of disrespect.\n\nEven if the choice itself of changing MOH was actually warranted in the first place, the way it was handled definitely takes this into asshole territory. \n\nESH; both OP and her friend behaved like assholes for different reasons but I gotta say I think OP was almost worse", "Honestly after our conversation when I asked her if she even wanted to be IN the wedding, I was a little surprised she thought she still was the MOH.

And probably did.\n\nAfter all, by my count, she bailed on three events/activities entirely (including the planning for two of them), skipped out on helping plan a fourth, and barely showed for a fifth one. How much other helping out did she get out of doing? Decorations, invitation envelope stuffing, etc.\n\nIt sounds like she was getting away with murder and you were letting her. If you didn't say anything to tell her that she was skating on thin ice, she probably thought she had it made.\n\nOr maybe she had something going on her life that she decided to not bother you with, and was so deep in her own issues that your talk with her was a blip on her radar.", "Don\u2019t let it run in your head anymore \u2026 it\u2019s done and in the past\u2026 if it really mattered to her then she would have stepped up and showed up when you needed her and when you tried to talk to her .", "My friend had two as well.
