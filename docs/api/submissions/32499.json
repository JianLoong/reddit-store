She asked me to plan the bachelorette party. I agreed. I planned it perfectly and had it as a surprise. I messaged the other girls the plan. When they all agreed I went ahead and booked my idea. I spent (this is on top of the $1K I spent earlier) $400 on a limo to go bar hopping (the bride loves bar hopping) and I booked us a $700 AirBnB to crash in afterwards. As of right now the other bridesmaids did not chip in, this was out of pocket, but they said they would pay me back later.\n\nAbout a month later I and two other girls got kicked from the bridal party group chat along with a paragraph from the bride saying we were no longer invited because we weren't \"honouring her wishes\" When asked, she didn't answer what she meant or what we had done wrong. Two days pass and she adds us back to the chat and apologizes saying she's just stressed, we all talk about it and made up. Yesterday same thing happened except this time I'm the only one removed with a paragraph going off on me, telling me I'm not respecting her or her wishes, that she wishes she never invited me or asked me to be a bridesmaid. When asked what happened or what I did wrong, again radio silence. Today she messages me apologizing saying she's sorry for lashing out and that she'd like me there but not as a bridesmaid as it would make her \"uncomfortable\", and that I'm not allowed to wear the dress I had already bought as it's a bridesmaid's dress. I told her I respectfully declined as I couldn't afford another dress as I've already spent too much on this wedding and that I didn't want to make her uncomfortable on her big day. She then lashes out telling me I should just take more from my student loans to buy a second dress. So with that, I went and cancelled the Airbnb and the Limo. I told the other bridesmaids what had happened and they agreed it was fair. One of them must have told the bride about the secret bachelorette party as she messaged me telling me I'm an asshole and I've ruined her entire wedding as she now doesn't have time to book a new bachelorette party in time and she nor any of the other bridesmaids have the money or savings to book anything.

When you \u2018all talked about it\u2019 the first time did anything make sense? \n\nNevertheless NTA.  Why is she comfortable spending your money on her party? Why are the others still comfortable being in her party?", "NTA. What I find funny though is that you planned and arranged the bachelorette party (which is basically only for the bride and her bridesmaids from what I know) (idk much so forgive me if I\u2019m wrong on this) and then when she removed you as a bridesmaid you cancelled it(which you have every right to) and when she found out she went off at you and is calling you an asshole for not deciding to continue to fund her party which might I add you wouldn\u2019t even go to or participate in. I\u2019m sorry that this happened, she seems like an entitled snob and it sounds like you dodged a bullet there.", "NTA. I'm surprised your other friends didn't seem able to fill you in as to what made the bride change her mind about you, seeing as how you seem to have no clue (even though you asked). Very weird; let us know if you find out the back story.\n\nI think anyone who tells you to take your student loan money and spend it on her wedding is super self-centered and not a friend. Moreover, she sounds ignorant about how borrowing money and paying bills and stuff like that works.\n\nMove on to better friends.  \n\nAlso, learn to live within your means. Right now, you are in school and budgeting. So in these situations, be honest and just say you'd love to chip in the extra for (trip/AirBnB/fabulous wedding gift/whatever), but \"x\" amount is beyond your budget right now.

Like this whole wedding was such a halarious show of \"look at how well loved we both are, look at all these groomsman and bridesmaids\" and yet years later i doubt they are on speaking terms with a quarter of the people who attended the wedding. \n\nSo dont sweat it. You arent losing out on some grand friendship. People who act like that and just imediately default to \"oh im just a stressed bride\" arent anything to get worried about. Because next its \"oh sorry for me acting that way, buying a new house is stressful.\" \"Being pregnant is stressful.\" \"Having a baby is stressful\" \"oh moving is stressful\" \"having a kid in school is stressful\" \"oh the holidays are so stressful\" \"oh this vacation planning is just so stressful\" see the pattern?

Anyone would be.   \nSo many people are left with no one to really celebrate their 'special day' with or having to plan their own parties all on their own because no one steps up - you BOOKED EVERYTHING, without even asking for any money upfront (which would have been fair, given you're a student and not able to just splash money like that). \n\nWhat you mentioned in another comment about her simply not wanting to 'have a skinny girl next to her at the altar' shows her insecurity and deep, deep lack of respect of you. She doesn't see you as her friend who went out of her way to plan something for her, she sees you as an enemy, someone who could take away from her spotlight. \n\nShe is showing herself to be extremely childish and unappreciative - she deserves to not have a bacholerette party, or at least to have to plan it all on her own. That's what you get when you treat the person showing up for you badly", "NTA - in any way, and the bride is demented.\n\nWhat seems absolutely crazy from my perspective is the expectation that the bridesmaid (or MOH, or whoever other than the bride/groom) will spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars for other people's wedding.

If they didn't have the money to book anything else how were they going to pay you back? They weren't ever, is the answer. It might be worth reflecting on how you managed to get to a place where you thought the friendship was brilliant enough to risk so much money.

You've got a lot to learn from this.", "NTA and I month is time for them to pay you back for the party", "NTA a friend wouldn't ask someone to use student loans to pay for a party.\n\nA lot of friends stop being friends but people refuse to see it.", "NTA.\n\nThis girl clearly isn't even a friend if she's disinviting without telling what was wrong.\n\nEven moreso that you hadn't gotten any money from any of the other bridesmaids and so to think that you should front a bill for anything related to something that you're not a part of is absolutely stupid.\n\nNow, that said, prior to cancelling the bookings you SHOULD have directly called the MOH and said \"I don't know why i've been disinvited twice despite being apologized to twice, but after being yelled at multiple times for an unknown reason I'm not going to be attending. If you can venmo me the cost of the bachelorette party plans in full by tomorrow or the day after that then i'll keep them active and transfer whatever I can to other people's names, but if not then i'll be cancelling them to get my money back. Sorry if this puts you and the other girls in a bind but I don't have the money to just float this on trust of getting paid back when i'm not attending.\"\n\nThough the words from the bride imply that you were probably going to get stuck with the bill even if you were still going. The fact that she says no one else can afford to book anything but wants you to TAKE OUT MORE LOANS FOR IT is just absurd. \n\nLastly, the fact that this bride thinks her entire wedding is ruined because she can no longer get wasted a time before the wedding speaks LOADS for her character.\n\nI'm sorry that you'll be hurt by this, but the person you consider your best friend probably doesn't even remotely think of you in the same ballpark.

THEN, she only removed you, citing later to another friend that it's because she's insecure about her own weight. \n\nI call BS on this excuse due to the fact that she only got upset once she found out you canceled the party. This is further proven when she says that her and NONE of the other bridesmaids can afford a party. She just wanted you to bankroll the whole event. She probably even expected you to pay the bills on the big night out (bar tabs, entrance  fees, food, ect.). \n\nShe might have even thought that it was too close to the reservation date, and you wouldn't have been able to cancel it at all. She was hoping you'd be shit out of luck on getting your money back, and her and the other bridesmaids would be able to party the night away on your dime.
