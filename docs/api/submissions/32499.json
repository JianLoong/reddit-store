She asked me to plan the bachelorette party. I agreed. I planned it perfectly and had it as a surprise. I messaged the other girls the plan. When they all agreed I went ahead and booked my idea. I spent (this is on top of the $1K I spent earlier) $400 on a limo to go bar hopping (the bride loves bar hopping) and I booked us a $700 AirBnB to crash in afterwards. As of right now the other bridesmaids did not chip in, this was out of pocket, but they said they would pay me back later.\n\nAbout a month later I and two other girls got kicked from the bridal party group chat along with a paragraph from the bride saying we were no longer invited because we weren't \"honouring her wishes\" When asked, she didn't answer what she meant or what we had done wrong. Two days pass and she adds us back to the chat and apologizes saying she's just stressed, we all talk about it and made up. Yesterday same thing happened except this time I'm the only one removed with a paragraph going off on me, telling me I'm not respecting her or her wishes, that she wishes she never invited me or asked me to be a bridesmaid. When asked what happened or what I did wrong, again radio silence. Today she messages me apologizing saying she's sorry for lashing out and that she'd like me there but not as a bridesmaid as it would make her \"uncomfortable\", and that I'm not allowed to wear the dress I had already bought as it's a bridesmaid's dress. I told her I respectfully declined as I couldn't afford another dress as I've already spent too much on this wedding and that I didn't want to make her uncomfortable on her big day. She then lashes out telling me I should just take more from my student loans to buy a second dress. So with that, I went and cancelled the Airbnb and the Limo. I told the other bridesmaids what had happened and they agreed it was fair. One of them must have told the bride about the secret bachelorette party as she messaged me telling me I'm an asshole and I've ruined her entire wedding as she now doesn't have time to book a new bachelorette party in time and she nor any of the other bridesmaids have the money or savings to book anything.

When you \u2018all talked about it\u2019 the first time did anything make sense? \n\nNevertheless NTA.  Why is she comfortable spending your money on her party? Why are the others still comfortable being in her party?", "NTA. What I find funny though is that you planned and arranged the bachelorette party (which is basically only for the bride and her bridesmaids from what I know) (idk much so forgive me if I\u2019m wrong on this) and then when she removed you as a bridesmaid you cancelled it(which you have every right to) and when she found out she went off at you and is calling you an asshole for not deciding to continue to fund her party which might I add you wouldn\u2019t even go to or participate in. I\u2019m sorry that this happened, she seems like an entitled snob and it sounds like you dodged a bullet there.", "NTA. I'm surprised your other friends didn't seem able to fill you in as to what made the bride change her mind about you, seeing as how you seem to have no clue (even though you asked). Very weird; let us know if you find out the back story.\n\nI think anyone who tells you to take your student loan money and spend it on her wedding is super self-centered and not a friend. Moreover, she sounds ignorant about how borrowing money and paying bills and stuff like that works.\n\nMove on to better friends.  \n\nAlso, learn to live within your means. Right now, you are in school and budgeting. So in these situations, be honest and just say you'd love to chip in the extra for (trip/AirBnB/fabulous wedding gift/whatever), but \"x\" amount is beyond your budget right now.
