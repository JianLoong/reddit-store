You're an entitled AH for not accepting her very generous offer and expecting her to do even more. Your counter offer is laughable and she would be an idiot if she agreed to it.", "Your fianc\u00e9e agreed to cover all your expenses for 3 years to help you pay off debt\u2026 I\u2019d express my sincerest thanks and get ready to start your life together.   \n\nGetting her to pay off your debt upfront makes it sound like you\u2019re going to divorce her as soon as your debt free. Gonna go YTA.", "YTA\n\nSeems like the only one who is actually getting anything out of this is you. Your fiance pays off the debt, she spends her money on other things and saves for other things. It's your debt. It's not her responsibility.", "YTA. She helped you create a realistic timeline to pay off your debt. You didn\u2019t need to come up with a counter offer where she pays for everything.", "YTA. Don\u2019t blow this. There are so many guys that would be over the moon for your offer. You have a wonderful fianc\u00e9 and need to listen to her.", "She will lose interest in the savings she gives you, so the net gain will be the difference between your debt interest and her savings interest.  The big difference in the plans is that your idea makes it easier for you to scam her.  YTA", "YTA.\n\nAnd if I were her I'd be wondering if you were trustworthy or responsible.", "YTA - Financially freedom and independence is clearly hugely important to her. She is being so gracious and hardworking to cover all of the bills while you get your life together financially, and you want to ask for MORE? Also even if you want her to loan you the money, you need to get it all done in writing with strict timelines for payback and clear compensation for her when/if you can't. If you can't figure out how to meet her need to a debt free partner then end it now and let her move on to someone with similar goals.", "YTA. Her plan was very nice and generous. You have valid points but you're missing the ONE reason your plan doesn't make sense. It doesn't protect *her.* she's already helping you by paying for all of your bills while you get debt free. That's a huge risk in and of itself. Don't ask for *even more* when she is already offering you a great plan that also helps her feel protected. \n\nIf she just immediately pays off all your debt and you decide to leave her, then what? She's out in the cold and you're debt free running off to be with a new cooler model. \n\nNot saying that is your plan but I can see why she isn't okay with just paying it off for you and how it would make her feel too vulnerable or exposed.", "Yeah YTA. \nHer other option is to not marry you until you pay off your debt. When you get married it becomes her debt too you numbskull \ud83d\ude02 You are the one in debt, not her. Apologize and work your ass off to pay off your debt. Quite frankly after you pulled that, I would suggest to her to get a prenup.\n\nEdit to get rid of word voice to text picked up in background.", "I would be telling her to cancel the wedding if she was my relative or friend.", "YTA and if I were her, what I'd be thinking about isn't your ridiculous counter-proposal, but rather whether it's really a good idea to marry someone like that. You are taking her resources for granted.", "YTA.  She is clearly financially savey and offered you an incredibly generous offer to support you whole you work to get out if debt before you married and your debt becomes joint debt.  You should jump at that.  YTA for expecting her to pay off your debt now with no guarantee that she recoups that money.  What if something happens to your relationship, your income, or you?  She shouldn't have to assume any risk to her finances to pay off your debt.  She is already being more than fair with her current offer.", "Yes, YTA. You are asking your fiancee to pay off your debts without any kind of legal or financial commitment first. She is offering you a solid chance to pay off your debt aggressively, and the fact that you came back with a counterproposal that she should just pay them off for you instead with no guarantee that she'll ever see that money from you afterward is concerning.", "YTA. Her plan was thoughtful, solid, and kept your unmarried debt separate, and your counter seems to only benefit you. She\u2019s been working really hard to get herself into a great financial position and you basically just want her to snap her fingers to make your debt go away, while taking away from her savings trajectory. Maybe ask her to go over her spreadsheet and how she came up with the numbers so you can understand her thought process and get on the same page.", "YTA. It's *your* debt, not hers. And *your* debt payback plan is the weird one, not hers. \n\nShe's offering you an incredibly generous plan, and it's not enough for you? If she were my friend, I'd be advising her to consider whether you're really marriage material.", "YTA\n\nThere should be no counter offer here. She cleared her debts on her own. She is offering to support your ass while you clear your debts. That is incredibly generous. Instead of showing gratitude for her offer to support you. You counter with dumping $70,000 of your debt in her lap.\n\nGirl could do WAY better. I hope she figures that out before she is permanently tied to you.", "YTA, they are already giving you a great deal by covering all of the bills for both of you and although everyone would save more money from them just paying all of the debt off that is leaving you with a whole lot of responsibility in not breaking up with them after all this debt is paid off. That's not to say they doesn't trust you it's just very risky.\n\nAlso if some of there money is in investments they will lose the opportunity of compounding interest if they have to sell them to pay for your debt and that is not great in the long run if that is your plan, not to mention paying taxes too. I would accept the already great offer you have been given with glee.", " YTA. You\u2019re twice the AH also for thinking it is Ok to allow her to pay for everything do you. \n\nMight be time for you to step up and get a side hustle too.", "YTA- your looking to use her money to solve your problems, she made you a most generous offer and instead of using that to work your own way out you\u2019re asking her to \u2018pay it for you\u2019\u2026", "YTA her offer is beyond generous. She's willing to cover all of your living expenses, you focus on paying your debt. Take it or leave it don't try and take a mile or five extra.", "YTA. Just pay your debt. I don't see what the problem here is. Obviously she crunched the numbers and you can afford to pay your debt back in the time limit with $200 in fun money left over EVERY CHECK while she pays for all of the bills and date nights and everything else. I'm lucky if I get $200/month for fun money *after* paying all of my own bills and whatnot. \n\nYou sound like you'd rather she just take care of it all at once with a far off payment date which sounds a whole lot like you want her to pay for it all so that you can neglect paying it. I have doubts you'd remember to save it all back and would pay her back in that time.\n\nNo matter how much money she has or how much she loves you taking on 67k of debt for somebody else is *always* a gamble on your own finances. She is essentially handing you that money with no guarantee you'll pay her back for it.\n\nYou sound like you spend your money poorly to begin with. You say it will be many decades until you're debt free but she came up with a plan to get you there in 3 years where you don't have to pay for ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL and you won't even take that.", "YTA Primarily because if you all split up she will have paid your debt and will probably have to sue you to get her money.  I don't even like the deal as she offered bc she is getting screwed.  You need to figure out how to meet your obligations and be debt free on your own and contribute to the living expenses.", "Yta. Your fiance made a very reasonable and generous plan for you to take responsibility for your own debts. Instead you want her to take responsibility for your debt, deplete her savings and carry you while (if) you pay her back. She sweat and sacrificed to become financially stable and you just wanna piggyback off her the easy way.She takes the risk and you get the reward. And you are disparaging her plan as \"weird\"? Really?! She's the one who's debt free and owns a home before 30 and you are have the nerve to question and disparage her financial advice? That's totally selfish and unreasonable. If you don't want to follow her plan don't do it but don't be surprised if the wedding never happens", "YTA. \"I'll pay you back\" is a promise that not many people actually honor. And it creates fights over when you're gonna pay her back. It's generous enough for her to allow you to live rent and expenses free. Take that offer.", "Hey can you throw me your fiance's number? I'd like to pay off my debt while living rent and bill free for a few years.\n\nJesus Christ dude get your head out of your ass, apologize and hope she's still ok with the original deal\n\nY T A", "YTA she worked off her debt & now you want her to pay off yours because it's easier for you. That's brazen of you. You're responsible for your premarital debt & she doesn't owe you a penny towards it but is offering to subsidize your life so you can pay it off in record time.", "YTA.  \n\nYour proposal puts all the financial risk on her head, and she gets not a single fucking cent for taking that risk.  It's not even just the risk that you might break up.  What if you get hit by a bus?  What if you get seriously ill?   If something like that happens, she's fucked.\n\nI also work at a family law office.  Sure, you state now, while you are happy and in a relationship, that you would pay her back. I speak from personal experience that after a breakup that promise is usually about as valuable as a cup of cold piss. It's easy to promise the moon up front, and it's even easier to back out later.  I've seen it time and time again.\n\nDid you even offer to get a proper signed contract that would legally bind you to repaying that money?  I'm betting you didn't.  I'd bet that you just told her to trust you.  You'd be YTA for that alone, but the sheer entitlement and greed you're showing is enough for me to vote you the AH even without knowing that for sure.", "YTA.. wow...", "YTA - she still has to be somewhat protected against taking on your debt, and she proposed a very generous plan to get you out of debt without her draining her savings to accomplish that. Why did you feel the need to ask for even more?!", "She WBTAH if she agreed to this.   YOu have a sweet offer and you want more.   She should bolt", "Asking for someone to pay your debt, even if you plan to return is not something I would recommend doing to anyone, especially not when you are given a very fine deal anyway.", "YTA.\n\nIf I'm your fianc\u00e9e I'm looking at this as a huge red flag because you clearly aren't on the same page and furthermore expect her to fund your debt for an extended period.\n\nHer plan isn't weird, hust hard core but given how much debt you have, its a good plan.", "YTA... and a bullet she'd be smart to dodge.", "YTA -- If I were your fianc\u00e9, my response would be HELL NO.  They gave you an offer, take it or leave it. Don't insult them by calling their plan \"wierd\" when its actually incredibly generous. Your counteroffer is actually the \"wierd\" plan because its wildly entitled - exactly WTF do they get out of your plan?", "YTA. Your fianc\u00e9e is making an incredibly kind offer to support you for two years while you pump all of your extra money into paying down your debt. You're now arguing with her about that? Seriously? What are you thinking?", "YTA", "YTA. The offer she gave is already a huge financial strain on her and you should be beyond grateful.", "YTA\n\nShe is making an amazing offer - you should take it before she decides to let you pay everything off on your own and she cancels the wedding.", "YTA\nBecause she laid a good plan where she covers most of not all living expenses from what I can tell and you can be debt free before marriage. Instead you counter offer and put her into a bad position where SHE will be left with your debt and burden if you seperate and refuse to pay her back. Of course no one like interest rate but your counter is her having to take 100% of the risk if you don't pay her back. \n\nDon't do this to her, its not fair. She paid of her debit, do your job, say thank you, don't be greedy and don't put her in a bad emotional or monetary position. \n\nPlus if her capital/savings is locked into some long term GICs then the interest paid by you is offset by what she gains from her return. If you marry, then you can use her returns on the investment to pay towards mortgage or whatever else.", "YTA. It's a good scam. If you are a good fiance and not a scammer you should accept the generous offer.", "YTA. Honestly it sounds like you want to bail after the debt is paid. If I were your fianc\u00e9 I\u2019d be suspicious.", "Your counter offer might be a bit more reasonable if you were married. Since you aren't there is literally nothing stopping you from getting her to pay off your debt and then leaving her. I'm not saying that's what you'd do, but you need to think about this logically from her end.", "YTA  \n\n\nIf I were your fianc\u00e9 I would withdraw the offer and let you pay YOUR debt alone.\r  \n\r  \nYou are one of those who offer their hand and take the whole arm.", "YTA   She's already helping you tremendously with the living expense's.  This is YOUR debt, not hers. I understand you don't like the interest but there is NOTHING stopping you from picking up side gigs and working extra, much the same as she did to get where you want to be.  What she really wants to know is:  Are you capable of following a budget and working for it or are you going to be relying on her?", "YTA And she would be dumb to agree", "YTA\n\nYour friends are right, she'd be a fool to pay off your debt outright. Seriously, you have a woman that is smart with money, don't be a dumbass. Discipline is what gets you out of the situation.", "Info: have you made a spreadsheet for your idea? Are you able to show her exactly how you would be able to pay her back in 1.5 years? Real numbers? That would be the only way to carry this discussion forward -- to show her your plan.\n\nIf you haven't,  why not?", "YTA. She\u2019s funding your lifestyle so you can Become debt free. Messed up think your should get more", "Suggesting an alternative isn't what makes you an asshole. What makes YTA is the way you phrased this post. There is nothing \"weird\"about her payback plan. \n\nIts a solid plan that would leave you debt free before marriage while she generously covers the expenses for both of you in the meantime. \n\nSounds like you don't want to do the work to be debt free. Or maybe you have a hangup about her covering all the bills if you take up her offer. Either way, you're friends are right. YTA.", "YTA. You are not married yet. I could see why she would not just want to jump in and pay your debt. You could up and leave at any time.  Besides, why would you even expect her to just pay it because she has the money? She\u2019s trying to help you settle it yourself since YOU got YOURSELF into that debt and she\u2019s already gotten herself out of her own.", "YTA. She losses 2 years of investment growth and whatever penalties incurred from withdrawing the money so that you can enjoy a 0 percent loan which you'll be under no pressure pay back. What's the upside for her?\n\nShe's already offered to basically refund you your share of daily expenses for the next 2 years essentially paying towards your debt, cutting into her savings and she's not asking for any of it back. Her offer is already more than generous.", "YTA she\u2019s made you an amazing offer to participate in getting your finances in order. (Funny how you itemized all her debts but not yours) She may understand your debt to more frivolous in nature perhaps? And instead of gratitude, you gave her a\ncounter offer that would leave her holding the bag if you reneged and you might not be that good of risk.", "YTA - Nice try to get 67k out of her faster. She's gonna need a pre-pre-nuptual contract to deal with you.", "NAH, borderline AH. Strictly financially your offer does make more sense because you\u2019ll pay a lot less interest over the life of the debt. I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re talking about her cash savings where her interest rate is less than your debt\u2019s interest rate. If she\u2019d have to sell investments to pay your loans then it\u2019s a terrible idea because the market is down so she\u2019d likely be selling low and losing out on future gains.\n\nYour plan is probably not the healthiest option for your relationship. She worked her ass off to get out of her debt, and she likely knows that finances are one of the leading causes of divorce. So she wants to see you get your shit together, not get a bail out. Her plan is very generous, you won\u2019t have a weird debt dynamic with your fianc\u00e9, and you\u2019ll still pay much less interest overall than you would with the way you\u2019re currently addressing the debt, so it\u2019s still a win for you. You\u2019re just looking at the numbers, but you\u2019re missing a large part of the story. $200 per month doesn\u2019t feel like enough fun money though.", "SNIFF! Sniff! I smell the marinara!!

I'm not going to call you an AH because you didn't do anything wrong. I also don't think you are being greedy or ungrateful as some others here have said. Your logic made sense because you thought about the interest rates on your debts and how they wouldn't matter (and therefore you would pay less in the long run). You maybe didn't think about how it could be taken as being ungrateful nor how her interest on her savings would suffer and therefore it wouldn't necessarily be a great counter offer. \n\nNonetheless, you didn't do anything but mention an additional option. She wasn't cool with it, so that's fine, too. Go with the first offer if it makes her more comfortable, but you're not an AH for suggesting an idea you had. For a future marriage to work, you need to keep feeling open and comfortable bringing your thoughts and ideas to the table, as much as you also have to be okay with your idea not always being the one you as a couple go with. Good luck!", "NTA for talking/having a conversation, however you would be if you apply pressure or refuse to accept an answer once given. However you need to realize that even though you'd be saving interest, you'd also be taking money that is earning her money aka costing her interest/dividends/whatever. Possibly or even likely, she would make less than what you are paying but you are failing to take into account that you're costing her more earnings than simply the amount of debt she'd be paying.", "Unpopular opinion NAH, but be careful.

If she's acting like she's in charge and using this money in a way that makes you feel manipulated, NTA. If you two can make a decision like adults and figure out what take both of your needs into account (and also benefits your future TOGETHER) then there's no reason for either of you to be assholes.\n\nThe thing is, interest sucks. I get where you're coming from. If you're respectful in how you mention it then I don't think you did anything wrong. Personally, I'm wouldn't be comfortable with this whole situation unless you two are totally transparent about how the financial relationship works. Since this is an issue at all I am assuming you're planning to keep your finances separate (which is totally reasonable), but if you're getting married I assume you're at least doing some stuff together?\n\nI don't think you're an asshole for suggesting it. You be a massive asshole if you insisted on it like she owed it to you. She's an asshole if she's using her better financial position to control you.\n\nIf she's really not okay with that, maybe have her use some of that money she'd be spending on your bills to pay back that debt and do the bills split between you accordingly. That way you can reduce the interest payments on whatever is the highest rate (like credit cards) but she's still not feeling like she's getting taken advantage of.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't be comfortable being beholden to someone like that, but I am also not in your financial position.

Offering to cover his living expenses is the safest way for her to support him in getting to a better position financially and to be honest, a way for her to see if they\u2019re both of the same mindset when it comes to finances. He sounds a bit immature when it comes to finances, especially with his laughable counter offer. Her offer is a way to show support of him as they grow together. \n\nWith his plan, if they broke up before they got married SHE is the one who loses all their savings, not him like your comment suggests.

That'd be insane, and if he thinks that he's 110% the asshole and she should leave him right now. It just didn't seem like that's what he was saying.\n\nTbh, his wording seemed pretty level-headed to me, idk why everyone is assuming he's just here to take her money and leave. Personally, if I was in the fiance's position I'd probably not want to pay back the whole debt either but it's not like it shouldn't be allowed to be a discussion.\n\nALSO: the more I've thought about this the more I agree the fiance shouldn't pay it all like he's proposing. All I'm suggesting is that there may be better options than the exact plan she suggested, and he's not an asshole for not instantly accepting it. He's only an asshole if he doesn't have the open and honest conversation required to figure out what the best thing to do for their collective financial goals are.\n\nMaybe a better plan would be to have her help wipe out anything high interest, for example. If the worry is interest eating into your collective future (she wouldn't be so set on wiping out the debt if that wasn't a factor) then wouldn't that be the most useful plan? Help pay the bills instead of doing it all at her mercy, put the rest towards the debts, and if she wants to help make the burden easier: she can pay off the credit card debt, then contribute a little to the rest bit by bit so she's not killing her savings and taking a chance on you.\n\nHell, even take the offer but discuss the time-table and amounts. Same concept. It's not a bad thing to have the talk, just don't, well, be an asshole.\n\nIt's good to build the habits anyway, the more I think about it the more I think it's a good idea to do SOMETHING closer to her plan, just maybe not so extreme. I just don't think it makes OP an asshole to question it.\n\nEdit: wanted to clarify that I DO NOT think he's owed the money or anything like that; also added one point I thought of after the fact, just for clarity about what I mean by discussion.\n\nEdit again: added some stuff, because I really don't think OP's fiance should pay for the debt outright after talking with many people.", "Not before she's paid all the wedding deposits though!", "Not wanting to inherit his 70k debt is financially responsible of her.

And what if you break up before the 3 years is over?\n\nShe still has her money and you'd still have your some of your debts if you break up in the middle of the 3 years.

It might work it might now but you need to be very clear at defining the engagement. \n\nYou both need to figure out mathematically what makes the most sense. Where is that money coming from? Her money that\u2019s invested? While the markets globally are down so much? What\u2019s the interest on the debt? This is a math problem. Once you figure out what makes the most sense mathematically you can proceed. \n\nIf it ends up being your fianc\u00e9 pays the debt that\u2019s fine, but you need to create a legal document that you owe her this money. Again, this is a business transaction within a personal relationship. The better it is defined and spelled out on paper the less it gets personal.

If you had pressed the issue after suggesting it, you would be TA, but suggesting the alternative plan, especially since interest rates is the primary consideration for this, is not an A move at all. It's a way to put you both into a stronger financial situation. \n\nThat is, a stronger financial situation if the repayment plan works out. The concern may be that you wouldn't pay her back after that time period, and that is understandable. A lot can happen between now and then, things that you both have no control over.\n\nMight I suggest a third option? Is it possible to take out an actual zero-interest loan from her to pay back the debt immediately? That way you'd have a formal agreement to pay her back in monthly increments, and she would have the reassurance that there's a binding legal way for the money to get back to her.

So, it's not really a counter-offer because what she said is a suggestion from which YOU benefit as well, she's not buying something from you. Your suggestion is reasonable if you figure out a way to financially benefit her and put everything in writing so she is protected if you break-up. She should not experience any long-term loss from this under any circumstance.

Right now you have financial obligations to organisations who have legal leverage to make you satisfy these obligations - your suggestion means that you're asking your girlfriend to spend ~$70k with none of that, no assurances other than \"I'll pay you back, honest\". That would be fucking stupid of her to agree to, even if you're her forever soulmate. You're asking her to take on every single piece of risk in this situation, abolishing yourself of it all. That's pretty goddamn selfish that you'd ask that of her.\n\nHer way, you get to live rent and expenses free for 3 years and prove that you can service grown-up obligations by yourself. She's out the extra cash for keeping you afloat during that time, but that's often considered an acceptable cost of a loving relationship - sometimes you gotta support each other.\nYour way, she's out a massive chunk of her savings up front, including the interest she'd earn on that cash and assets, and you get to continue life with no worries. You'd get to WALK OFF with no worries, if it came to that. Not fair in the slightest.", "NAH.\n\nAll in all, you've been offered a good deal.\n\nYou've countered with what you think is a better deal for both of you.\n\nHowever, it might not save as much money as you might expect at first glance. \n\nFirst off - I'd take the offered deal right now, and think about potential improvements later. She's probably pissed off that you didn't immediately accept the idea when she first offered because it is the only way, so far, that you'll pay the debt by your wedding without her actively giving you money for your debt - which your suggestion is at the other extreme of. \n \n####Back to your suggestion. \n\nEssentially what you're talking about is a debt consolidation loan, or debt refinancing, which people do every day. Instead of paying multiple creditors with variable (and usually high) interest rates they take out a loan with a fixed rate of interest for a fixed term. Obviously this is only better if the fixed rate is lower than the variable marginal rate across your other debts. \n\nHowever, there can be multiple costs incurred by this method. \n\n####Costs for her. \n\nHave you really considered how she'd pull 67K out of the air?\n\nIf she's having to sell investments then she might be on the hook for capital gains taxes.\n\nOf course there's also the hesitation of cashing out an investment before you think its done growing - so she may lose out on big gains there, but those are theoretical. \n\nImagine she has bitcoin, it's currently worth 17K USD per coin. Imagine, she cashed out 70K worth to pay your debt and within a year it rises back to 70K USD per coin - you'd both be pissed. \n\nIf she needs to cash in fixed term savings bonds, she might lose a lot of potential interest on those savings\n\n####Costs for you\n\nAnd then of course there's debt repayment conditions. It's not massively uncommon for loans to have an early repayment fee.\n\nBasically, the loan servicer or possibly the owner of the debt, is expecting X amount of interest to be paid over 10 years.\n\nBut if you pay it off after only 5 years, they've just lost out on 5 years of interest payments - so they charge a fee to make up some of the difference.\n\nOther repayment conditions, although usually exclusive to mortgages in my experience, incur a fee if a monthly repayment is too large. Basically the same as an early repayment fee - let's say you win some money at poker or something and want to make a larger than usual payment... Well they'll take a cut of that, because you've just shortened the overall repayment period so have cut off a decent amount of interest.\n\n---\nOverall, there's probably something that I've missed in terms of possible costs, but I suspect that your fiance will have checked all those boxes if she's gone into such depth and spreadsheeted it all out.\n\nSo, after tallying it all up - how much money could you and your fiance lose in fees, lost savings interest, capital gains taxes, etc...\n\nVs\n\nHow much you'd save in not having to pay interest on your debt.\n\nHonestly, I'd just say to her that it sounded like a better financial decision on the face of it, but it requires investigation.\n\nAlthough, honestly, I'd suspect that the biggest issue is a possibility of breakup. If you broke up before you'd fully repaid her and thus went back to paying for stuff independently, there would be zero chance that you'd manage to keep up with the payment schedule of 1.5 years.\n\nThe breakup risk could be mitigated with a contract, but that would probably be of dubious legality, and still leave her savings at risk.\n\nHonestly, take the current deal. Thank her profusely, and speak to her about looking into your idea together because you think it's the best for both of you.\n\nBe open to the idea that you're wrong.\n\nDiscuss it openly and don't be defensive.", "YTA.

I think the best bet would be to split the main bills, and then have her help contribute a little bit by bit. That way he's not completely at her mercy, and can actually make some decisions about how to run his life. \n\nAlso, if all he was asking for was to get rid of any high interest debt he has, I think that'd be super reasonable. 67k is a lot, but if some of that is credit cards it might even be enough to mean the interest is making a huge difference in the amount they can collectively save.", "She\u2019s also saying: I want to see that our financial approaches are compatible before I marry you.\n\nShe aggressively got herself out of debt. She wants to know that OP is on board with doing that, when needed.", ".. What? Nowhere does it say that she is even touching his money. She made a spreadsheet and showed him that if HE put all his money towards HIS debt (other than $200/$400 depending if per cheque or per month), then he could pay off his debt by the wedding.\n\n\nThe money still goes from his bank account to his creditors, no fiancee involved (other than her offer to pay for everything else out of her own bank account). I struggle to see how it could possibly be abuse when it's literally a suggestion where she has no control over the execution.", "Wouldn't it be worse if he owed her 60k, not other places that he could stop giving as much too if he wants to?", "Yup. Absolutely horrible approach by OP. I truly hope his partner just breaks up.", "I think it's just that AITA Aficionados absolutely hear stories where someone is wildly taking advantage of another, unrepaid loans, affairs, greed, entitlement, etc...\n\nSo it's reasonable for her to want him to pay his own debts, and it also makes sense she wants to help him by covering food housing and bills.", "You just answered your own question with your own logic.", "I think the AH move was not questioning it, but the counter offer he came up with. Blowing a huge chunk of cash like that - if she can even get a huge chunk like that depending on how her investments are structured - will at least put her behind on liquid assets for emergencies. And whatever he's paying in interest on his debts, she'll be losing in interest on her savings, or at least close. Plus, even if they do everything with a loan note and repayment plan, having the debt gone is going to drastically reduce his drive for repayment. There's definitely potential for it to turn into \"I know I missed that payment, but I took us on vacation, want that a much better use of our money?\" And similar potential scenarios. Will it happen? Who knows, because she doesn't. She pulled herself out of debt without assistance; he got a great offer and came back asking for even more.\n\nPlus, let's say that he does fill out a proper loan contact with her and everything. Will there be interest? If so, not much point in him not paying it back to the original lender. If not, what if they break up? Now she's given her ex an interest free five figure loan to her own detriment. And she's got to act as loan holder, take legal action if he misses a payment, it's a mess.\n\nMuch cleaner all around for him to do her original offer", "I think your plan makes sense and should be considered.

But paying interest to people outside the family unit is a guaranteed money loser.", "Yeah, this is a good point. I edited my post. I think you're right. After seeing other posts I realized that most is college debt which isn't so bad interest wise. If anything, he might be making a mistake by paying that off instead of buying while the market is low. Basically, the best plan I can think of would be to \"take her offer\" but talk to her about maybe just focusing on the high interest rate stuff and then having her teach him to invest, assuming the interest on the college stuff is actually under what he could expect to get from investing. Then of course he'd still work to pay it off, just maybe not be forced to do it fully in 3 years. That shows even more financial responsibility imo.", "Well, if that's the case then I see no problems here other than deciding whether the line should really be no debt before marriage. If they'd be making more in interest than saving from the college loans what OP should do is keep the college debt paying off slowly, pay everything else (he did mention a car, that's usually much higher interest than college debt) and have his fiance help him learn to invest.", "Good point, I had forgotten about that ngl. Editing my reply. Also, she's probably going to make more on investments than he will spend on college loan interest.", "Plus a tax event.", "Lol, yes, I was all over the place and definitely confused.

This is why I don't use reddit...\n\nI will say, though, I still don't think he's an asshole I just think he's not thought it through yet. His reasoning seemed like he was trying to reduce the overall dollars spent. You're 100% right though that she shouldn't pay it \\*for\\* him.\n\nI'm not sure what about him actively showing he can pay it off and expressing an interest in learning to plan ahead/invest would be, though. Obviously OP didn't say this, it was just a proposal. If he did that, and like you said maybe asked for an extension on the timeline, I think all would be good. If OP is opposed to that, maybe you're right and he is the AH.\n\nEdit: also, I've been around the internet for a long time but I'm new to reddit. I don't like accounts and stuff... Partly because I myself am bad at thinking things through, I have a tendency to speak before my mind has fully caught up. I'm always willing to talk and figure out why what I said was dumb though!", "Let's not forget OP was planning on paying off his debt over **decades.**", "No, what you said seemed harsh. Not her. Also, you're 100% right about her not paying it all off: I've been talking and thinking more and I REALLY do not think she should pay it all off. I never meant to imply that to start with, but I ESPECIALLY don't think that now. \n\nThat would mean taking money out of the market, and it's just generally not a super smart thing to do. College debt has lower interest than expected long run returns from the market. Really what I think should happen here is that OP should talk to her again and rescind his request for a lump sum, accept her helping to pay the bills, but also suggest focusing on 1st paying off any high interest debt, then investing some in addition to continuing to pay off the rest, just maybe not entirely before they get married. That'd end up with them being better financially off overall, and show more financial maturity imo.", "But he wouldn't be at her fiscal mercy. He's welcome to not enter the arrangement pay all his own bills and remain indebted for a longer period of time to his creditors. She is being gracious and has already offered more than \"middle ground\". She's offering him free living to focus on his debt repayment. Her taking on his actual debt in the hopes of being paid off would be putting her at a high risk of losing the money and his mercy. Because if things went sideways he'd be in a excellent financial position but she'd lose 70 grand...and goodluck suing to get it back...thats not small claims court numbers. That's hiring a lawyer and then trying to actually have the judgement enforced. She'd potentially spend more thousands of dollars and decades of her life trying to reclaim her savings. If they follow her plan and they breakup he is still ahead financially and she hasn't lost more than a bit of extra bills each month. They can cut their losses and move on.  If they stay together this gives him time to pay off his debt and learn better money management skills which would benefit him singly and within their marriage", "It is NOT financial abuse.\n\nShe is covering all living expenses and he is paying down his OWN debt.     He can choose to not pay or pay less any time he wants.  She does NOT control his money.\n\nFinancial abuse is when someone is actually holding the purse-strings so the abused person CANNOT access or control the money.  At NO point does she control his money.\n\nThe most she can do is break up with him if he is being irresponsible.  And then, with his debts paid ahead, and the total debt significantly reduced, he's still in better shape financially.", "Honestly, I was thinking more that she's using this as a teaching lesson and he's just completely ignoring that part of it.

She should leave you and find someone better.", "I was this way before I even found Reddit - there are maybe 3 people in the world I trust to loan money to.  Anyone else?  If the reason was compelling I would gift what I thought right.  She is being so completely generous to fund everything so he can be debt free within a couple of years instead of a decade or two.  OP should kiss the ground she walks on in gratitude!", "True. I've never been someone who used reddit until extremely recently; I dislike making accounts and generally don't want to leave much of a trace on the internet if possible (yet here I am now...) \n\nThat said, this is one of the main places on reddit I've known about, and it's always been because of batshit crazy stories of people  either abusing the hell out of others, or being taken wildly advantage of and being afraid to speak up. I can get why people would see this that way, even though I don't think it's what's going on.", "But if she covers the bills, she's going to be out money anyway. Why give all that money to the lenders?", "His t-shirt that says \"I wouldn't want to pay back the whole debt\" is raising a lot of questions already answered by his t-shirt.", "Definitely, we know nothing about OP or his fiance. It's just advice after all. I think after talking with some more reasonable people who aren't just telling OP he should go stick his \"offer\" up his ass I've come to appreciate the problems with what he's suggested more. I hope he and his fiance are able to make something work out, as it doesn't sound to me like he genuinely has bad intentions.\n\nI could be wrong though, sometimes really nasty people don't even realize they're bad. You never know, indeed.", "Paying off slowly costs more.  The income he's yet to receive isn't earning interest now. Her assets are. Even if we disregard her need for mutuality and to protect herself from being abused, her plan makes more cents.", "I never said she should pay his debt back directly. Most of it is college loans, she shouldn't touch those. I was only suggesting that if she wanted to help, maybe she should help make sure he doesn't have credit card debt if he has that as well, since that's the real financial strain.\n\nI didn't mean to come off as supporting her paying his debt overall, looking back I guess I didn't really make that clear. My bad.\n\nI still don't like the idea of one person in a relationship having all the financial power. I wouldn't marry a man that I thought would use making more money than me as a way to subtly force me to go along with their plans. I just want there to be discussion and have everyone be open about it. Thankfully I'm not in that position, but well, it's a thing that people I've known have experienced.\n\nAnyway, you're right that he doesn't have to stick with it and he loses nothing. The conclusion I've come to is that no matter what he should make sure that he's grateful and appreciative of whatever she ends up doing to help him in the end, regardless of what form it takes.\n\nEdit: phrasing.", "are you kidding or just not understanding lol? she\u2019s not taking his money and forcing him to only have 200$ a month- its going towards paying off HIS DEBTS. if they broke up he would still have his whole pay check to do whatever he wanted with (and his debt), he just wouldnt have someone paying for him to live anymore", "The deadline is very short though? Three years. I would understand your point if it was a prolonged to where if they do end up breaking up he\u2019d be shit out of luck. But 3 years is a short amount of time to pay off his debt. Since she\u2019s paying for everything he can also save those $200 a month as another form of security for himself.", "I only have $19,000 in debt. I will marry her with that deal she is giving her fiance.", "Same. I just think OP is being a doofus by looking a gift horse in the mouth, when fiancee is still being really generous.", "And he still can't make the connection which is why he is wearing the t-shirt. Just to make his case. God this hurts my brain to use his logic", "New to reddit, despite being on the internet for a long time. Idk if this is lingo I haven't picked up. What do you mean t-shirt? I deleted my other comment, since it didn't contribute anything meaningful...\n\nI already said I agree that the fiance shouldn't pay his debt off fully, I'm just saying that there might be other options for how the two of them can move forwards if he's uncomfortable with the particulars of the situation she suggested.\n\nWhen I said \"it's not like it shouldn't be allowed to be a discussion\" that's only in regards to the whole situation. I am not saying he was right to ask for the debt to be repaid, I'm saying that the particular point about interest he was making is valid. He should talk to her about that so they are both on the same page, just maybe this time don't ask her to pay it all....", "The money is invested. Long-term average return on the stock market is around 10%, give or take. She'd be giving up all of that return.", "I mean, I wouldn't get 67k into debt, but I'm very fortunate to be in a life situation where I don't have college debt combined with a job that doesn't pay enough to pay it off. Unfortunately for OP, despite there being a million jobs out there right now, the high paying ones are harder to come by. \n\nThe more I think about it, the more this looks like two people with good intentions not coming off the way they planned. OP shouldn't put the entire burden of his debt on his fiance. But personally, I wouldn't accept the deal she gave him either. The problem is that if he doesn't accept this situation of her basically making all financial decisions, then he'd have no way to repay the debt and meet \"the deadline.\" I don't think she should pay more, I think they should consider finding an acceptable level where he's contributing to normal expenses, the debt is being paid off reasonably quickly, and then accept a little wiggle room on how much debt is really okay (rather than none, or we're done.)", "I mean, it still doesn't feel like that's a very comfortable way to go about it. I think they'd be better off if they found something a little less lopsided. He should pay his debts, no question about that. She shouldn't be on the hook for them. But if she's offering, maybe there'd be a better solution where he helps pay bills and she helps make sure any high interest debt gets paid off as quickly as possible.\n\nAlso, I definitely get why she wouldn't want him to have debt: it seems like the fiance is the defacto breadwinner here. That said, if it's really a hard deadline and she would not be able to accept something like 3/4 gone in 3 years, she seems a little... Well I don't know what the right word is, but it makes me uncomfortable.\n\nEdit: just realized that last bit implies something I do not mean to imply. I think it's likely that they're both perfectly reasonable people. I don't like to assume ill intent when someone's just thinking things through. The fiance is almost certainly just trying to be helpful, I'm just proposing one thing that might change that (since all we have is a reddit post to go off of.)", "I don\u2019t think you are understanding this at all. She cannot control his bank account nor is she denying access to his bank account. The entire reason why the fianc\u00e9e wants the debt dissolved before marriage is that when you marry the debt is shared. She does not want to become 67K in debt. We can go back and forth with break up what ifs all day but that would be boring and I have a life so I\u2019m not going to do that. You are looking at everything with a break up in mind, if they are going to get married neither of them are planning on breaking up. Weddings are an expensive process.  I\u2019m also going to address your opinion on saying most people wouldn\u2019t want to be controlled with a plan like this. Your opinion seems incorrect if we just base it on the comment section. As someone who does have debt, I would love for someone to handle all finances while my only finance is just to pay off my debt.", "She\u2019s actually being very generous. Offering to pay all the bills for 3 years so he can focus on paying off his debt is a very kind (if not risky)thing to do. He can literally choose to walk away after the three years and be completely debt free and not have paid any bills either. If anything, she has more to lose than he does in this situation.", "because he is TAKING and she is GIVING. that's the difference.", "Fair enough, I think you're probably right lmao. Also, someone mentioned to me that college debt is lower interest than you tend to make from investments. Maybe he should just ask to see if she's okay with him focusing on the stuff that's not college loans and then have her help him learn to invest.", "She is helping him though - by paying for EVERYTHING else while he pays off his debts.", "Fuck, I get everything paid for, amd still get to keep se of my paycheck and get out of debt?! Sign me up for this payment plan", "Hell, even if they break up, he's getting a free ride for however long they last to pay off his own debt! He'll come out of the relationship FAR better off than he went in if he follows this plan...", "Yeah, that's true. That's absolutely helpful. She doesn't owe him shit.\n\nI'm not saying it would be less lopsided if she used her money to pay off his debts. Financially, if she spends the same amt of money, it's no more or less lopsided no matter how she spends it. Regardless of whether there's a \\*slight\\* advance or just purely paying his share of bills each month (I'm not supporting the route of her paying all the debts, just suggesting getting anything with high interest paid off first to make everyone's life easier.)\n\nThe only thing I found lopsided--and maybe that was a bad choice of words, given the context--is that she has the financial power to make decisions about his life. I don't think it's a healthy relationship if he has to accept whatever conditions she sets regardless of whether he may have things he'd like to discuss. I don't think that's what's happening, but it's much easier to end up like that when one person has money and the other doesn't.\n\nLike, for example, if I got engaged to a man who worked his ass off to get through med school and now makes big bucks as a doctor while I was still paying off my college loans, I wouldn't want him to ask me to completely restructure my finances so he doesn't feel like he'll be responsible for my debt when we finally tie the knot.

I suspect you made the right decision, as unless they REALLY need help now it probably made more of a difference for you.\n\nRealistically, they just need to talk about it again, and figure out what plan works for everyone involved. How to best let her help him without putting her at risk, and without giving him an ultimatum about his finances (which she isn't doing, but some have suggested.)\n\nI don't think she should actually directly pay the debt. The more I've talked to people the more I agree his offer is the wrong move. I do think there's definitely discussion to be had though. OP needs to do that, and based on the tone of his post I think he probably will.", "Indeed, like he basically just told her that he doesn't want to act like a partner, he wants her to do all the work. It's a reason to walk away", "That\u2019s very true! Lots to consider. Bottom line is that of the fianc\u00e9 says no, that\u2019s a no. It\u2019s her money and her decision in the end.", "She won't agree to this. She seems like a smart lady!", ">A better option would be OP's fiance helping him get a personal loan and  \n refinance his debt to a lower rate, then give him an equal share of the  \n bills so he can learn to be less entitled.  \n\nI like this, tbh. Sounds like a good idea. That said, if majority is student loans that might not actually lower the interest rate. \n\nI definitely DO think he should be helping with bills though. Get anything high interest refinanced or paid, then he can pay the normal stuff back as fast as he can while also contributing.\n\nI think if there's any part of this that's meant to be assuaging her worries about his financial status (and I'd be very surprised to hear otherwise) then that should be a part of it.", "It\u2019s HER money. Not his. SHE WOULD BE MAKING MORE.", "Also if she were to liquidate investment accounts to come up with the lump sum she\u2019d probably take a tax hit", "She sounds savvy enough to know that cash is not a good investment. It's a good idea to keep a few months salary in cash but more than that? No.", "Or possibly a test? If she's going to tie herself legally to someone, it's reasonable to want to see some evidence that they have a similar perspective on saving/debt, and the discipline to meet goals.", "And to think, he fails to realize that if he pays for his own debts like a responsible adult, it might improve his credit score down the road.\n\nNope, I see him as the type to bolt the moment his debt balance hits zero.", "It could be the fact that it's probably less money for her to support him in his debt free goal (rent/food/utilities) than it would be to just fork over a huge chunk of savings.\n\nPlus, anything can happen in three years, and if she takes all that out of her savings to wipe his slate clean, then worst case scenario she's out a huge chunk of money as well as the love of her life. \n\nMaybe she wants to work together with him, like partners. She'll take care of him while he pays down money she doesn't owe.", "Because if she pays off all his debts, and he decides to break up with her, it's incredibly hard for her to get her money back. I've heard way too many stories (in real life) where one partner gets a lot of financial benefits and then breaks things off once they've got the highest financial gain they could.", "Ugh, I didn't think I needed to specify this, but I don't think she has 67k in literal cash, I think she has 67k liquid.
