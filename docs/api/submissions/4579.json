You're an entitled AH for not accepting her very generous offer and expecting her to do even more. Your counter offer is laughable and she would be an idiot if she agreed to it.", "Your fianc\u00e9e agreed to cover all your expenses for 3 years to help you pay off debt\u2026 I\u2019d express my sincerest thanks and get ready to start your life together.   \n\nGetting her to pay off your debt upfront makes it sound like you\u2019re going to divorce her as soon as your debt free. Gonna go YTA.", "YTA\n\nSeems like the only one who is actually getting anything out of this is you. Your fiance pays off the debt, she spends her money on other things and saves for other things. It's your debt. It's not her responsibility.", "YTA. She helped you create a realistic timeline to pay off your debt. You didn\u2019t need to come up with a counter offer where she pays for everything.", "YTA. Don\u2019t blow this. There are so many guys that would be over the moon for your offer. You have a wonderful fianc\u00e9 and need to listen to her.", "She will lose interest in the savings she gives you, so the net gain will be the difference between your debt interest and her savings interest.  The big difference in the plans is that your idea makes it easier for you to scam her.  YTA", "YTA.\n\nAnd if I were her I'd be wondering if you were trustworthy or responsible.", "YTA - Financially freedom and independence is clearly hugely important to her. She is being so gracious and hardworking to cover all of the bills while you get your life together financially, and you want to ask for MORE? Also even if you want her to loan you the money, you need to get it all done in writing with strict timelines for payback and clear compensation for her when/if you can't. If you can't figure out how to meet her need to a debt free partner then end it now and let her move on to someone with similar goals.", "YTA. Her plan was very nice and generous. You have valid points but you're missing the ONE reason your plan doesn't make sense. It doesn't protect *her.* she's already helping you by paying for all of your bills while you get debt free. That's a huge risk in and of itself. Don't ask for *even more* when she is already offering you a great plan that also helps her feel protected. \n\nIf she just immediately pays off all your debt and you decide to leave her, then what? She's out in the cold and you're debt free running off to be with a new cooler model. \n\nNot saying that is your plan but I can see why she isn't okay with just paying it off for you and how it would make her feel too vulnerable or exposed.", "Yeah YTA. \nHer other option is to not marry you until you pay off your debt. When you get married it becomes her debt too you numbskull \ud83d\ude02 You are the one in debt, not her. Apologize and work your ass off to pay off your debt. Quite frankly after you pulled that, I would suggest to her to get a prenup.\n\nEdit to get rid of word voice to text picked up in background.", "I would be telling her to cancel the wedding if she was my relative or friend.", "YTA and if I were her, what I'd be thinking about isn't your ridiculous counter-proposal, but rather whether it's really a good idea to marry someone like that. You are taking her resources for granted.", "YTA.  She is clearly financially savey and offered you an incredibly generous offer to support you whole you work to get out if debt before you married and your debt becomes joint debt.  You should jump at that.  YTA for expecting her to pay off your debt now with no guarantee that she recoups that money.  What if something happens to your relationship, your income, or you?  She shouldn't have to assume any risk to her finances to pay off your debt.  She is already being more than fair with her current offer.", "Yes, YTA. You are asking your fiancee to pay off your debts without any kind of legal or financial commitment first. She is offering you a solid chance to pay off your debt aggressively, and the fact that you came back with a counterproposal that she should just pay them off for you instead with no guarantee that she'll ever see that money from you afterward is concerning.", "YTA. Her plan was thoughtful, solid, and kept your unmarried debt separate, and your counter seems to only benefit you. She\u2019s been working really hard to get herself into a great financial position and you basically just want her to snap her fingers to make your debt go away, while taking away from her savings trajectory. Maybe ask her to go over her spreadsheet and how she came up with the numbers so you can understand her thought process and get on the same page.", "YTA. It's *your* debt, not hers. And *your* debt payback plan is the weird one, not hers. \n\nShe's offering you an incredibly generous plan, and it's not enough for you? If she were my friend, I'd be advising her to consider whether you're really marriage material.", "YTA\n\nThere should be no counter offer here. She cleared her debts on her own. She is offering to support your ass while you clear your debts. That is incredibly generous. Instead of showing gratitude for her offer to support you. You counter with dumping $70,000 of your debt in her lap.\n\nGirl could do WAY better. I hope she figures that out before she is permanently tied to you.", "YTA, they are already giving you a great deal by covering all of the bills for both of you and although everyone would save more money from them just paying all of the debt off that is leaving you with a whole lot of responsibility in not breaking up with them after all this debt is paid off. That's not to say they doesn't trust you it's just very risky.\n\nAlso if some of there money is in investments they will lose the opportunity of compounding interest if they have to sell them to pay for your debt and that is not great in the long run if that is your plan, not to mention paying taxes too. I would accept the already great offer you have been given with glee.", " YTA. You\u2019re twice the AH also for thinking it is Ok to allow her to pay for everything do you. \n\nMight be time for you to step up and get a side hustle too.", "YTA- your looking to use her money to solve your problems, she made you a most generous offer and instead of using that to work your own way out you\u2019re asking her to \u2018pay it for you\u2019\u2026", "YTA her offer is beyond generous. She's willing to cover all of your living expenses, you focus on paying your debt. Take it or leave it don't try and take a mile or five extra.", "YTA. Just pay your debt. I don't see what the problem here is. Obviously she crunched the numbers and you can afford to pay your debt back in the time limit with $200 in fun money left over EVERY CHECK while she pays for all of the bills and date nights and everything else. I'm lucky if I get $200/month for fun money *after* paying all of my own bills and whatnot. \n\nYou sound like you'd rather she just take care of it all at once with a far off payment date which sounds a whole lot like you want her to pay for it all so that you can neglect paying it. I have doubts you'd remember to save it all back and would pay her back in that time.\n\nNo matter how much money she has or how much she loves you taking on 67k of debt for somebody else is *always* a gamble on your own finances. She is essentially handing you that money with no guarantee you'll pay her back for it.\n\nYou sound like you spend your money poorly to begin with. You say it will be many decades until you're debt free but she came up with a plan to get you there in 3 years where you don't have to pay for ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL and you won't even take that.", "YTA Primarily because if you all split up she will have paid your debt and will probably have to sue you to get her money.  I don't even like the deal as she offered bc she is getting screwed.  You need to figure out how to meet your obligations and be debt free on your own and contribute to the living expenses.", "Yta. Your fiance made a very reasonable and generous plan for you to take responsibility for your own debts. Instead you want her to take responsibility for your debt, deplete her savings and carry you while (if) you pay her back. She sweat and sacrificed to become financially stable and you just wanna piggyback off her the easy way.She takes the risk and you get the reward. And you are disparaging her plan as \"weird\"? Really?! She's the one who's debt free and owns a home before 30 and you are have the nerve to question and disparage her financial advice? That's totally selfish and unreasonable. If you don't want to follow her plan don't do it but don't be surprised if the wedding never happens", "YTA. \"I'll pay you back\" is a promise that not many people actually honor. And it creates fights over when you're gonna pay her back. It's generous enough for her to allow you to live rent and expenses free. Take that offer.", "Hey can you throw me your fiance's number? I'd like to pay off my debt while living rent and bill free for a few years.\n\nJesus Christ dude get your head out of your ass, apologize and hope she's still ok with the original deal\n\nY T A", "YTA she worked off her debt & now you want her to pay off yours because it's easier for you. That's brazen of you. You're responsible for your premarital debt & she doesn't owe you a penny towards it but is offering to subsidize your life so you can pay it off in record time.", "YTA.  \n\nYour proposal puts all the financial risk on her head, and she gets not a single fucking cent for taking that risk.  It's not even just the risk that you might break up.  What if you get hit by a bus?  What if you get seriously ill?   If something like that happens, she's fucked.\n\nI also work at a family law office.  Sure, you state now, while you are happy and in a relationship, that you would pay her back. I speak from personal experience that after a breakup that promise is usually about as valuable as a cup of cold piss. It's easy to promise the moon up front, and it's even easier to back out later.  I've seen it time and time again.\n\nDid you even offer to get a proper signed contract that would legally bind you to repaying that money?  I'm betting you didn't.  I'd bet that you just told her to trust you.  You'd be YTA for that alone, but the sheer entitlement and greed you're showing is enough for me to vote you the AH even without knowing that for sure.", "YTA.. wow...", "YTA - she still has to be somewhat protected against taking on your debt, and she proposed a very generous plan to get you out of debt without her draining her savings to accomplish that. Why did you feel the need to ask for even more?!", "She WBTAH if she agreed to this.   YOu have a sweet offer and you want more.   She should bolt", "Asking for someone to pay your debt, even if you plan to return is not something I would recommend doing to anyone, especially not when you are given a very fine deal anyway.", "YTA.\n\nIf I'm your fianc\u00e9e I'm looking at this as a huge red flag because you clearly aren't on the same page and furthermore expect her to fund your debt for an extended period.\n\nHer plan isn't weird, hust hard core but given how much debt you have, its a good plan.", "YTA... and a bullet she'd be smart to dodge.", "YTA -- If I were your fianc\u00e9, my response would be HELL NO.  They gave you an offer, take it or leave it. Don't insult them by calling their plan \"wierd\" when its actually incredibly generous. Your counteroffer is actually the \"wierd\" plan because its wildly entitled - exactly WTF do they get out of your plan?", "YTA. Your fianc\u00e9e is making an incredibly kind offer to support you for two years while you pump all of your extra money into paying down your debt. You're now arguing with her about that? Seriously? What are you thinking?", "YTA", "YTA. The offer she gave is already a huge financial strain on her and you should be beyond grateful.", "YTA\n\nShe is making an amazing offer - you should take it before she decides to let you pay everything off on your own and she cancels the wedding.", "YTA\nBecause she laid a good plan where she covers most of not all living expenses from what I can tell and you can be debt free before marriage. Instead you counter offer and put her into a bad position where SHE will be left with your debt and burden if you seperate and refuse to pay her back. Of course no one like interest rate but your counter is her having to take 100% of the risk if you don't pay her back. \n\nDon't do this to her, its not fair. She paid of her debit, do your job, say thank you, don't be greedy and don't put her in a bad emotional or monetary position. \n\nPlus if her capital/savings is locked into some long term GICs then the interest paid by you is offset by what she gains from her return. If you marry, then you can use her returns on the investment to pay towards mortgage or whatever else.", "YTA. It's a good scam. If you are a good fiance and not a scammer you should accept the generous offer.", "YTA. Honestly it sounds like you want to bail after the debt is paid. If I were your fianc\u00e9 I\u2019d be suspicious.", "Your counter offer might be a bit more reasonable if you were married. Since you aren't there is literally nothing stopping you from getting her to pay off your debt and then leaving her. I'm not saying that's what you'd do, but you need to think about this logically from her end.", "YTA  \n\n\nIf I were your fianc\u00e9 I would withdraw the offer and let you pay YOUR debt alone.\r  \n\r  \nYou are one of those who offer their hand and take the whole arm.", "YTA   She's already helping you tremendously with the living expense's.  This is YOUR debt, not hers. I understand you don't like the interest but there is NOTHING stopping you from picking up side gigs and working extra, much the same as she did to get where you want to be.  What she really wants to know is:  Are you capable of following a budget and working for it or are you going to be relying on her?", "YTA And she would be dumb to agree", "YTA\n\nYour friends are right, she'd be a fool to pay off your debt outright. Seriously, you have a woman that is smart with money, don't be a dumbass. Discipline is what gets you out of the situation.", "Info: have you made a spreadsheet for your idea? Are you able to show her exactly how you would be able to pay her back in 1.5 years? Real numbers? That would be the only way to carry this discussion forward -- to show her your plan.\n\nIf you haven't,  why not?", "YTA. She\u2019s funding your lifestyle so you can Become debt free. Messed up think your should get more", "Suggesting an alternative isn't what makes you an asshole. What makes YTA is the way you phrased this post. There is nothing \"weird\"about her payback plan. \n\nIts a solid plan that would leave you debt free before marriage while she generously covers the expenses for both of you in the meantime. \n\nSounds like you don't want to do the work to be debt free. Or maybe you have a hangup about her covering all the bills if you take up her offer. Either way, you're friends are right. YTA.", "YTA. You are not married yet. I could see why she would not just want to jump in and pay your debt. You could up and leave at any time.  Besides, why would you even expect her to just pay it because she has the money? She\u2019s trying to help you settle it yourself since YOU got YOURSELF into that debt and she\u2019s already gotten herself out of her own.", "YTA. She losses 2 years of investment growth and whatever penalties incurred from withdrawing the money so that you can enjoy a 0 percent loan which you'll be under no pressure pay back. What's the upside for her?\n\nShe's already offered to basically refund you your share of daily expenses for the next 2 years essentially paying towards your debt, cutting into her savings and she's not asking for any of it back. Her offer is already more than generous.", "YTA she\u2019s made you an amazing offer to participate in getting your finances in order. (Funny how you itemized all her debts but not yours) She may understand your debt to more frivolous in nature perhaps? And instead of gratitude, you gave her a\ncounter offer that would leave her holding the bag if you reneged and you might not be that good of risk.", "YTA - Nice try to get 67k out of her faster. She's gonna need a pre-pre-nuptual contract to deal with you.", "NAH, borderline AH. Strictly financially your offer does make more sense because you\u2019ll pay a lot less interest over the life of the debt. I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re talking about her cash savings where her interest rate is less than your debt\u2019s interest rate. If she\u2019s have to sell investments to pay your loans then it\u2019s a terrible idea because the market is down so she\u2019d likely be selling low and losing out on future gains.\n\nYour plan is probably not the healthiest option for your relationship. She worked her ass off to get out of her debt, and she likely knows that finances are one of the leading causes of divorce. So she wants to see you get your shit together, not get a bail out. Her plan is very generous, you won\u2019t have a weird debt dynamic with your fianc\u00e9, and you\u2019ll still pay much less interest overall than you would with the way you\u2019re currently addressing the debt, so it\u2019s still a win for you. You\u2019re just looking at the numbers, but you\u2019re missing a large part of the story. $200 per month doesn\u2019t feel like enough fun money though.", "SNIFF! Sniff! I smell the marinara!!

I'm not going to call you an AH because you didn't do anything wrong. I also don't think you are being greedy or ungrateful as some others here have said. Your logic made sense because you thought about the interest rates on your debts and how they wouldn't matter (and therefore you would pay less in the long run). You maybe didn't think about how it could be taken as being ungrateful nor how her interest on her savings would suffer and therefore it wouldn't necessarily be a great counter offer. \n\nNonetheless, you didn't do anything but mention an additional option. She wasn't cool with it, so that's fine, too. Go with the first offer if it makes her more comfortable, but you're not an AH for suggesting an idea you had. For a future marriage to work, you need to keep feeling open and comfortable bringing your thoughts and ideas to the table, as much as you also have to be okay with your idea not always being the one you as a couple go with. Good luck!", "NTA for talking/having a conversation, however you would be if you apply pressure or refuse to accept an answer once given. However you need to realize that even though you'd be saving interest, you'd also be taking money that is earning her money aka costing her interest/dividends/whatever. Possibly or even likely, she would make less than what you are paying but you are failing to take into account that you're costing her more earnings than simply the amount of debt she'd be paying.", "Unpopular opinion NAH, but be careful.

When did OP imply that he EXPECTED her to agree? I don't see why this cannot be a discussion for him and his fiance to have. He never said he was offended or anything like that.\n\nOP, this sounds like no assholes here, judging by the tone of your post. If you actually feel slighted, or like she owes you, YTA. If she's acting like she's in charge and using this money in a way that makes you feel manipulated, NTA. If you two can make a decision like adults and figure out what take both of your needs into account (and also benefits your future TOGETHER) then there's no reason for either of you to be assholes.\n\nThe thing is, interest sucks. I get where you're coming from. If you're respectful in how you mention it then I don't think you did anything wrong. Personally, I'm wouldn't be comfortable with this whole situation unless you two are totally transparent about how the financial relationship works. Since this is an issue at all I am assuming you're planning to keep your finances separate (which is totally reasonable), but if you're getting married I assume you're at least doing some stuff together?\n\nI don't think you're an asshole for suggesting it. You be a massive asshole if you insisted on it like she owed it to you. She's an asshole if she's using her better financial position to control you.\n\nIf she's really not okay with that, maybe have her use some of that money she'd be spending on your bills to pay back that debt and do the bills split between you accordingly. That way you can reduce the interest payments on whatever is the highest rate (like credit cards) but she's still not feeling like she's getting taken advantage of.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't be comfortable being beholden to someone like that, but I am also not in your financial position.
