We have 4 children between us & have been together for 5 years. \n\nTyler 10m, Mia 7f & Charlie 4m & Lila 1f. Tyler is my fianc\u00e9s biological son, Mia is my biological daughter and we are both Charlie\u2019s & Lila\u2019s parents. \n\nJames has not seen Tyler since he was 1 year old, his ex-partner Bella (28) doesn\u2019t allow him to have access to Tyler although we have tried. Tyler is under the impression that Bella\u2019s partner Logan (28) is his biological father and Bella has no intentions of telling him otherwise. James is not on his birth certificate as Bella didn\u2019t want to be charged with being with a minor. I am in contact with Bella and receive updates of Tyler 4-5 times a year, but that\u2019s as much contact as we have to do with Tyler. \n\nStory - I\u2019m about to come into some money, around $250k through compensation for a traumatic event, it should be in my bank by the end of the month. Due to this I asked James to sit down with me and allocate the funds so we don\u2019t blow it. \n\nImmediately I separated $100k out of the budget to go into a high interest account for Mia, Lila & Charlie that they can access at 23. \n\nI showed James this and he asked why Tyler\u2019s name wasn\u2019t included. I told him that he had told me from the start that he said I could do what I wanted with the money and it belonged to me and I was allocating it so our children could be taken care of in the future and to try and create generational wealth, I also told him that if Tyler was actually in our life I would include him but he isn\u2019t despite our efforts and I wasn\u2019t comfortable putting money away for a kid and taking from our children when I didn\u2019t know Tyler at all, I told him the only money I would allocate to Tyler was money to go to court and establish paternity and be able to have access to him but that was as far as I was willing to go. \n\nJames called me selfish and said that Bella has made his life hard enough cutting him out of Tyler\u2019s life and pretending her affair partner who was his best friend is Tyler\u2019s real Dad and he at least thought I would understand that he doesn\u2019t want to ruin Tyler\u2019s life by telling him his whole life is a lie and surprise I\u2019m your dad you haven\u2019t seen in 9 years and he thought I would have at least put money aside for him so when he learns the truth one day that James can reach out to him and be given something from him also. \n\nI told him that wasn\u2019t my responsibility and Tyler is literally not struggling for anything when Logan makes 350k a year and he has opportunities our children could only dream of. \n\nJames told me he couldn\u2019t believe me and is now sleeping in the spare room and hasn\u2019t spoke to me since. \n\nAm I really being an asshole?", "created_utc": 1672912423, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103v5sm/aita_for_not_gifting_any_of_my_money_to_my/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But the reality is that Tyler is not his son \u2014 legally or practically. He has no visitation, no custody rights, nothing. \n\nWhy would you set aside money for a child whose life would be \u201cruined,\u201d as James says, if he knew the truth? And how will this work? One day, Tyler learns that a complete stranger \u2014 you \u2014 has money for him (which he doesn\u2019t really need). You are the wife/fianc\u00e9 of his dad\u2019s former best friend. That\u2019s not weird????\n\nThe money would make a bigger difference in the lives of your other three children than it would in Tyler\u2019s life. That\u2019s the cold reality. \n\nIf James is suddenly so interested in Tyler, he needs to go to court and get some kind of access to him. Otherwise, I\u2019d really question James\u2019 motives here. \n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA \n\nBella however js a massive asshole. She was 17/18 and having sex with a 14/15 year old guy. \n\nIf you want access to Tyler then simply report her for statutory rape as that exactly what she did!\n\nTyler is being lied to by his mother, step father, father and step mother. This will be a massive mess when this kid finds out that everyone knew and kept it from him! \n\nYou putting money aside for your children is great. It is your money. Tyler is not your child. Tyler is not in your life. It is not up to you to provide for Tyler. \n\nI can see Tyler being a very confused and angry kid when the truth comes out. It either needs to come out know while he is young enough to process or as a successful 25/30 year old and is old enough to process. I sincerely hope he does not find out while in those formative teenage years that are hard enough already. \n\nAlso money isn\u2019t going to fix the Tyler issue in any way shape or form, especially if his pretend father is earning 350k a year.", "NTA - I think that's a pretty big ask to ask your partner to give money to a child you don't even know. And you said he isn't even aware your partner is his father? Like this is just a whole big recipe for disaster.", "INFO: How does your partner actually know if he is even Tyler's father if his ex was cheating on him with Logan at the time?", "NTA - it\u2019s your money and you should do what you want with it. Seeing as this kid does not know that your husband is his father and he is leading a good life, why should you give up your money for him. Plus, its not your husband\u2019s money so it\u2019s not for him to dictate who the money goes to. Very unfair of him to equate you to his ex for making life difficult as that\u2019s an issue between them and them only. Not your problem", "NTA. Whatever the reason you are receiving that money is, it\u2019s yours and you are allowed to choose what to do with it. If \u2018Logan\u2019 makes $350k a year - 100k more a year than you were given - there is literally no reason for you to give money. As well as the fact that the child has nothing to do with you other than your SO\u2019s past.", "NTA. \n\nIf anyone is being selfish it\u2019s James for telling you that you have full autonomy over what you do with your money and then having a shocked pikachu face and an outburst when you do exactly as you\u2019ve been told to. \n\nIt\u2019s your money OP, for your traumatic event not Tyler\u2019s or James. \n\nInfo : has James ever acted this way before? Is there a possibility that his ex may have asked for money from him and that\u2019s why he\u2019s acting out? Do you have money troubles?", "Nta. Do you trust your partner completely? Because it sounds a bit off to me. He wasn't planning on taking it himself? It's a bit strange to say he wanted to give Tyler something from himself when actually it's nothing to do with him. I would be very careful if I were you, money does weird stuff to people. This is your money, not his. Please if you are buying property or anything large make sure it's in your name only. You are not married and don't owe it to him. Maybe talk alone to a financial advisor and see what they say are your best options.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour money, your call to make the decision on how to split the money.", "NTA. People get weird (and greedy) when money is involved. If Tyler lives in a family with heaps of money then anything that is gifted to him as a \u2018sweetener\u2019 for not bothering to fight for him when he was a baby is hardly going to be helpful.

That\u2019s the weirdest part about his response.", "NTA but James has had a decade to get a paternity test and go to court. A DECADE. I'm finding it hard to believe he couldn't get a test in 10 years.", "NTA. Hames doesn't even know fir sure the child is his. You said the mother cheated with his best friend  so UT might be his. No need to put money aside for a child he isn't sure about and has no contact. Your offer to find out was very generous and he doesn't want to know for sure. It's not your problem.", "NTA. Too much to unpack here but yeah. Definitely NTA.", "YTA, your household has 4 kids, you want to put money away for 3 kids, and that's the wrong thing to do.

He didn't do the things then that he \"shoukd\" have done, and he's not doing them now. If he actually wants to be a parent to Tyler, to care and to provide for him in anyway, he needs to file a petition with the court. I understand why he would want some of that money to go towards him.\n\nI also understand why you feel like you shouldnt/don't want to cut him into the mix. There isn't a right or wrong person here.", "NTA. It's Your money, not any part of it is his. He can contribute to a savings account if he wants to. Paternity hasn't even been established, the child man not be his biological kid.", "Thank you. \n\nMy feelings are truthfully very conflicted right now. \n\nJames himself has said he doesn\u2019t see himself as Tyler\u2019s Dad anymore and it took him a long, long time to come to terms with the fact he wouldn\u2019t get to see him grow up or be apart of his life. \n\nI\u2019ve pushed for years to try and form a relationship and to James credit he lasted 6 months in contact with Bella, but ultimately she said that it didn\u2019t matter what he done that if he tried to come into Tyler\u2019s life she would turn him against James so he gave up. \n\nI think honestly James feels shit that this is probably another \u201cbig\u201d thing that Tyler is missing out on. \n\nI truly don\u2019t think he has other motives, or at least I hope he doesn\u2019t. \n\nThis whole situation is just so out of character for James I\u2019m honestly questioning myself and wonder if I just put something aside.", "Thank you. \n\nBella is something else indeed, asshole is probably to kind for her & I\u2019m grateful her contact is limited as my mental health drains when in contact with her. \n\nI\u2019ve said this to James also but he said it would only hurt Tyler so it\u2019s a losing battle for me. \n\nI agree Tyler is being lied too, I\u2019ve tried to ask Bella countless times to tell him before it\u2019s to late and she refuses to, we live in different countries now and I\u2019ve found tyler on Facebook, I sent him a friend request and Bella blocked me from his page and told me not to try and contact Tyler again or she won\u2019t send any updates. \n\nIt\u2019s a shit show to be fair and now that this has happened I\u2019m finally realising how bad things are with the situation with Tyler.", "Bella and James were in a relationship when he was 14 and she was 17 I\u2019m not entirely sure if the ages are correct, but she had been kicked out of home and my partner and his family took her in, they were each others firsts and she was pregnant within 3 months of them being together, I think they had been living together for around 2 months at that stage. \n\nBefore anyone asks, she had told his family she had just turned 15.\n\nFrom what I\u2019m aware, Bella and Logan started to see each other when Tyler was 6 months old? James was working with Bella\u2019s Dad at the time as he had just turned 15 and moved to another country as Bella had skipped the country when she was pregnant, James walked in on Tyler in the lounge crying and Logan and Bella in bed together.\n\nThe whole situation is a mess, but Tyler does look exactly like James from the hair to the eyes, to the freckles to feet. Tyler and Logan look nothing alike, I do believe Tyler is James son, I just want a paternity test done so that he can legally go onto the birth certificate and we can establish his rights as a father.", "Thank you. \n\nJames has never acted this way before but to be fair, he does get very emotional I guess when Tyler is ever brought up in conversation and it usually leads to an argument or him not wanting to speak about the issue any further? \n\nI highly doubt Bella has asked him for money as she hasn\u2019t spoken to him in over two years, she contacts me every so often with photos of Tyler and his two siblings and a 5 minute text conversation and I\u2019ve offered her money for him or to send him presents for birthdays and Christmas etc and she always has declined and says that Tyler doesn\u2019t need anything from us, she\u2019s only in contact with me so she can show him she tried. \n\nAlso, no we have no money troubles - we both work, we recently paid off all of our debt and are currently debt free, we have no savings due to getting rid of debt but we have started our savings account again and it should be healthy by April this year.", "Thank you & truthfully, I have issues with trusting men in general but James is my safe haven and I trust him. \n\nI agree money does weird things to people, that\u2019s why I thought it was better that we sat down before it even came so that there wasn\u2019t any fighting or anything turning sour between us. \n\nWe plan to buy property with the remaining of the money.. well get a mortgage anyway & he was the one who told me he doesn\u2019t want his name on the title and only wants mine so it\u2019s something I have and can always have, he even suggested opening a trust and putting it in there so it\u2019s safe as our country has a law that if you\u2019ve been together for longer than 3 years your partner automatically is entitled to half of you split or if you die, so unless I put the house into a trust it wouldn\u2019t matter if his name was on the title or not because he\u2019s still entitled to it.", "I think you should trust your intuition. This is such a sensitive issue. \n\nI realize that James sees this as yet another sign that he won\u2019t be in Tyler\u2019s life. But he needs to deal with that issue itself, either by deciding to change that or by coming to terms with it in a way that doesn\u2019t involve punishing you. \n\nI have to wonder if, on some level, James is jealous of this windfall and wishes he simply had more control over where the money is used.", "The other issue is that this ISN\u2019T James\u2019 money. He doesn\u2019t get a say in what happens with it unless you put it in a joint account and give him one, and even then you need to agree.", "All this aside  this is YOUR money.  Nta  it makes sense  what you decided.", "**Why don't you use some of this windfall to get an attorney and get 50/50 custody for your husband?**", "The saddest thing is that Tyler could absolutely handle knowing the truth now and processing it and being loved by 4 adults. \n\nFinding out anywhere from about 12-22 will be horrific for him and could set him on some horrible angry paths. \n\nSo if James isn\u2019t going to force it now then I hope, for Tyler\u2019s sake, he finds out as a fully functioning adult. \n\nNot ideal. But at least he has a better chance at managing his anger and shock as an adult. \n\nAs a teenager with all those hormone her has no chance. \n\nGood luck", "The only AH here is Bella, but as you have tried to get into contact with Tyler and if you are inclined in any way to give him a bit of money, this kid is going to need a LOT of help when he does find out- especially given this is a statutory rape situation. If Bella was pulling these kind of horrific 'stunts' at 17, what in the world is she pulling given the no contact situation? I would assume Tyler will need significant psychological help, and if he spins out he will need financial help. Being a safe haven and having a contingency plan in place of he does reach out will be a helpful buffer. Best of luck to you and your family.", "NTA. I do not think your fianc\u00e9 is an asshole, but he is definitely not acting rationally. He's in a situation where his son is living with his ex-girlfriend who cheated on him, pretending that his ex-best friend who was messaging about behind his back is his son's father. This is not healthy nor a normal way to deal with the situation. He says he wants to put money into Tyler's account for when he's older for \"when he finds out\" or whatever, but does he actually believe that one day Tyler will find out and come running to him with open arms or something? If your Dad knew he was your Dad, had practically no interaction with you whatsoever for your entire life, then showed up one day expecting you to suddenly have a father-child relationship with them... Would you want that?\n\nI am a firm believer that your \"real parents\" are not by default your genetic parents. Logan has raised this child for the past 9 years. If another 9 years go by with your fianc\u00e9 having no part in raising this child whatsoever, then at that point there's no more parenting to do. If you were to sign a handful of cash off to your fianc\u00e9's genetic child, all that's going to happen is Tyler is going to go through a lot of emotional distress in later life when he finds out, and he'll probably take the money and cut contact with your fianc\u00e9 anyway.", "He actually sounds like a good guy! I'm sorry for being negative. Perhaps he was just feeling like it's a way to make an impact on his sons life because currently he is not allowed?", "Thank you. \n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole either, I\u2019m just confused because this is out of character for him. \n\nIn the 5 years we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s always said that once Tyler turns 18 he will reach out to him and tell him the truth but I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s waiting until he turns 18? To be fair, Tyler is the only argument we have ever had and it\u2019s definitely a sore subject for James but I think he\u2019s filled his head with this magical story about what\u2019s going to happen when James is 18 as a sort of coping mechanism. \n\nYou\u2019re 1000% right though and I do feel like Tyler will just take the money and cut ties anyway because he hasn\u2019t had anything to do with James nor does he remember him. \n\nIt\u2019s a shit situation but I also understand that James is traumatised by the whole thing and that he\u2019s acting out of character, I guess my allocation of funds messes with his fairy tale he has planned and it hurts to speak down about James but I just feel helpless, if I give money then I\u2019ll resent James, if I don\u2019t then he\u2019ll resent me.", "It is a shit situation, and no offense to your fianc\u00e9 but if he's more worried about money for his son than being a part of his life then he needs to give his head a check anyway. I think there are more issues than just money here that need to be addressed. Hope things get better for everyone involved"]}
