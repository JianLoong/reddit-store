I have 2 younger half-brothers, who are my mom's and step-dad's kids.\n\nEver since they were born, my mom asked me to help to take care of them, since i'm the oldest, she always mentions that it is my responsibility. Since I started working, mom asks for 90% of the money I earn to help for house expenses, that includes buying whatever my brothers need, but as a result I barely have any money for myself, sometimes I spend it all in transportation only.\n\nThere was a time when she told me that i'm an entitled, that before getting remarried she spoiled me, and that was a way to teach me how the real world works.\n\nFor my 5yo brother bday in May, she bought him a Nintendo Switch, that seemed weird since they are always complaining about having little money, but I said anything. Last week was my 8yo brother's bday, and also got a switch. I said nothing during the day, but after the party I asked me mom if she bought the consoles with the money I gave her, and she answered yes.\n\nI said that money was supposed to go to house expenses, not consoles, my mom said that I also have to take care of my little brothers and it wouldn't hurt gift them something they will be happy with. Gotta admit, I got a little mad, because I can't afford anything for myself, for example, my phone is an old iPhone 6 that no longer gets updates, and rely on the computer my school gave me for studying. Told her that my brothers already have phones, tablets and a playstation, if she was gonna use the money on another console, I would rather use it on myself and things that I needed.\n\nShe called me entitled, and that is easy for me to say it since im not an adult with children, that all I have to do is study, work and as long as I live under her roof, I have to contribute financially, using money that could go for little brothers on \"stupid things\" was being selfish, and that I dont appreciate how much they as parents do for the 3 of us. Also told me that I'll have to pay rent starting at my 18th bday like a \"real adult\".\n\nI'm still in contact with my dad, but he told me that my mom's expectations for me are normal, and yes, is my responsibility as the older brother to \"help the youngsters\".\n\nI also told this to my classmate, but he says my mom is crazy and I should have money for myself.\n\nIm not sure about anything, that's why im asking here if i'm being entitled or if my mom is wrong.\n\nGotta make clear that both mom and step-dad have full time jobs.\n\nEdit: Gotta say that 90% was a rough estimate. I did some math and the exact amount I give her based on my current salary is 84.5%.\n\nI have so much to think about, my definition of a \"normal\" family seems to be completely wrong and I dont know what to do. I never questioned if my mom is a bad parent before. Thanks for all the comments.\n\nAlso, I dont have a bank account, my current boss is friends with my step dad, mom will always find me jobs when im jobless, and can't live with my dad because he has a new wife and wont let me live there fulltime.\n\nEDIT: Hi, I try talking to me grandma (Mom's mother), told her everything that has been happening to me, but she just said that is normal for me to take care of my brothers, and \"a little gift is nothing\" I tried to explain the finances to her but didn't listen, so I gave up.\n\nThen I called my uncle, mom's brother. After some talk, he told me that was in a similar position when he was a teenager and had to take care of my mom and their younger sister. I kindly asked if he could help me then, letting me stay with him after my 18th bday, but he shouted \"Hell no, I don't want my sister bothering me, sorry kid\" and hang up on me.\n\nMy mom's sister lives in another country, so she is out of reach.\n\nI'm still trying to digest the idea that my mom might be toxic, I literally never thought about it before, so im emotionally conflicted.\n\nI'll try to find a way to get myself fired from my current job, but some of you suggested joining the military. I don't know if I might qualify, but seems like an easy way out, but i'm scared of my mom's reaction when she finds out, and my brothers might be heartbroken when I leave.", "created_utc": 1669741651, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7zolv/aita_and_am_i_entitled_for_telling_my_mother_i/", "score": 2038, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I'm saying to look those up is some places depending on your age you have to have an adult open the account and you added. Some places it's different you can open up your own account. I would suggest opening up your own account and then having your paycheck direct deposited. Then I would get a written agreement with your parents for a reasonable amount of rent. Since you're renting a room in a house look at how much renting a room goes for in your area and pay about 25% of that going rate or 35% of your income whichever is easier on you. The reason that you want to get a written agreement is so that they cannot all of the sudden change their mind and say that you owe them your whole paycheck or something like that. You both would get a copy of it with each other's signatures and I would recommend keeping a copy of it digitally as well as a copy of it with a very good friend. Not only do you want to open your own account but you do want to open a separate savings account and also have more than 10% of your income going into that every paycheck. When it comes to money besides thinking about your needs right now you need to think about 5 years down the road as well. When it comes to responsibility of your younger siblings you are responsible for your actions towards them. I would also say being a positive role model.

He pays for things like his Discord server, video games, any stuff he wants outside of birthdays/holidays/agreed on things. Soon I will have him pay for his portion of the cell phone bill. He does not pay for utilities, household items, basic necessities, etc. as a mom it\u2019s my job to teach him to be responsible both as a contributing member of society and with his money.

He and I have each other\u2019s cards on our Apple Pay but would never use the other\u2019s without permission. This is, to me, establishing trust and healthy boundaries.

Last week was my 8yo brother's bday, and also got a switch. I said nothing during the day, but after the party I asked me mom if she bought the consoles with the money I gave her, and she answered yes.\n\nI said that money was supposed to go to house expenses, not consoles, my mom said that I also have to take care of my little brothers and it wouldn't hurt gift them something they will be happy with. Gotta admit, I got a little mad, because I can't afford anything for myself, for example, my phone is an old iPhone 6 that no longer gets updates, and rely on the computer my school gave me for studying. Told her that my brothers already have phones, tablets and a playstation, if she was gonna use the money on another console, I would rather use it on myself and things that I needed. \n\nShe called me entitled, and that is easy for me to say it since im not an adult with children, that all I have to do is study, work and as long as I live under her roof, I have to contribute financially, using money that could go for little brothers on \"stupid things\" was being selfish, and that I dont appreciate how much they as parents do for the 3 of us. Also told me that I'll have to pay rent starting at my 18th bday like a \"real adult\".\n\nI'm still in contact with my dad, but he told me that my mom's expectations for me are normal, and yes, is my responsibility as the older brother to \"help the youngsters\". \n\nI also told this to my classmate, but he says my mom is crazy and I should have money for myself.\n\nIm not sure about anything, that's why im asking here if i'm being entitled or if my mom is wrong.\n\nGotta make clear that both mom and step-dad have full time jobs.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There is too much potential for trouble.\n\nI'd also vote for you starting to look for a job that has nothing to do with your mother or stepdad. And yeah, others are right- if your mom is going to push for rent once you turn 18, you should be looking for other options (and making sure you have whatever paperwork you need safe and secure.) \n\nIt's also important to know local laws that are relevant to your situation. For example, in the US, if you are in high school and haven't graduated yet- your parents can't kick you out if you are 18 until you graduate. (Basically, acknowledging that some kids will turn 18 and parents will all 'leave now.' Most states- there may be exceptions- have laws that say parents are responsible for the extra 6-12 months until graduation.) It also means parents can't say 'pay rent or get out' because forcing the kid out isn't an option. The parents are legally obligated to provide food, clothes and shelter.", "NTA. Is what you pay now not rent? If not, what is it? She can Hargett you live there at 17. Talk to someone you trust at school about what's going on.", "NTA. Start squirreling away the money you are able to keep to open your own bank account and get a new job", "NTA - dude leave... she is taking advantage of you really badly and it will never end. Be prepared she will try to guilt you when you move out. \n\nIt is not and never was your responsibility to take care of her kids.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a mom of an 18 year old in her last year of high school. No, what your mom is doing is not normal. It\u2019s not loving and it\u2019s not particularly maternal.  I did contribute to household expenses and paid \u201crent\u201d but only after I had graduated from college and chose to live with my parents because I appreciated the security of having people I know and trust always around.", "Nta not normal.", "NTA, but your mom & sd are BIG TIME! That\u2019s YOUR money! I\u2019d tell them you aren\u2019t working anymore & stop giving them money immediately. Try to find a way to work without them knowing. You\u2019ll never be able to move out if you don\u2019t stop this right away!! I know. Probably easier said than done. Best of luck to you!\n\nMaybe you can talk to some of your friends parents about this. I know I\u2019d do whatever I could to help if this was happening to one of my kid\u2019s friends!!! Or the school counselor. This is just so wrong!", "NTA at ALL! I\u2019m 20F and though i don\u2019t have younger siblings. this is crazy to me. i have also had jobs since 16, and my parents didn\u2019t expect anything from me. nor did they expect me to pay rent when i turned 18. i still live with them currently. the boys are not yours to take care of. i would move out as soon as i turned 18 if i were you. this just seems crazy to me. it might be hard to move out that young but you\u2019re working a lot it sounds. open your own bank account as soon as you turn 18, and get a job that is not connected to your mom or step-dad asap, it sounds like that it hindering your pay as well. i wish you the best, and hope you can figure it out soon.", "THIS! Leave, she\u2019s taking advantage of you!  Babysitting services aren\u2019t free, also she would probably start freaking out the moment you move out as her additional ATM and free babysitter is now gone. \n\nFamily don\u2019t treat family the way she manipulates and takes advantage of you!", "Ding ding ding! This OP", "Forget it, because Mom isn't playing fair. She's brainwashed him into thinking its okay that she takes all his money. She's not going to sit down in good faith and sign a contract. This will just prolong the drama. \n\nHe needs to squirrel away as much as he can and leave at the earliest chance.", "OP is under 18. OP should not have to pay for room and board. OP needs to save every penny and get ready to leave once the hit 18.", "No, he is entitled to keep his money. It is literally his. Entitled is not a bad word. It doesn't mean spoiled, and it doesn't mean wrong or mistaken. He is entitled to keep his money and that is totally appropriate.", "NTA if you can move out as soon as possible", "\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d This!", "this^^this", "It is not normal, especially not normal to then use that money to give expensive gifts to a sibling. I can understand if things were very tight asking you to contribute some of your earnings to the household but NOT 90%. I\u2019m guessing somehow your parents just got greedy and they\u2019ve convinced themselves this is normal and persuaded themselves and you that you\u2019d be \u201cselfish\u201d to keep your earnings. Most people in the US who can afford expensive gaming equipment would be shocked and appalled. That\u2019s taking advantage of your kid almost to the point of slavery/human trafficking. \n\nI\u2019m going to suggest you reduce the percentage you give her to more like 50, which is still too much. I think at most asking a teen to give 30% plus paying for their own phone and clothes/transit is reasonable, and that\u2019s only if your family is seriously struggling even with both parents working full time. \n\nSave the rest of the money somewhere your parents don\u2019t know about and can\u2019t get a hold of. Until 18 you need an adult co-signer on a bank account but maybe a friend, cousin or grandparent could help you? The mom of the friend who told you this isn\u2019t right?  \n\nYou need to save up a cash cushion so you can move out. Rent is never supposed to be 90% of your pay and salaries in an area reflect that. You should be able to split on an apartment and still have money left for food, career training, fun and extras especially if you can start to work more hours. \n\nHonestly I\u2019m wondering if you could qualify for legal emancipation before age 18. You need a place to live independently, and a job that covers your expenses. Maybe someone would be willing to let you stay with their elderly relative as a home helper so they aren\u2019t alone at night and actually pay you live there. Or maybe you could find a job as a live-in nanny. Either way you\u2019d have actual cash for your work and not be handing it all over to the people providing the roof over your head. Frankly I think a judge would consider taking 90% of your pay unreasonable and grant you autonomy on those grounds, but check the rules in your state/country. \n\nIn the US, if you are declared legally emancipated you can get financial aid for college or other training without your parents and any income they have being considered. You wouldn\u2019t need them to file FAFSA so you\u2019d qualify for maximum aid. You could get about $7k in Pell grant aid which should cover most of the cost CC courses, either those working towards an academic degree or towards some kind of skill training program. You would likely also qualify for assistance from your state, for income tax credits worth another $2k, and possibly grants from universities as well. If you aren\u2019t emancipated your parents may still choose to claim you as a dependent to reduce their taxes (instead of your taxes going down) and you will have to work with them on any school finance paperwork. That\u2019s the incentive to resolve this early. \n\nAnother option to keep in mind: Starbucks offers employees free online degrees through Arizona State, which has very solid programs in dozens of majors. If you\u2019d like working there, you could cover rent and living expenses that way and have free school. Other companies (Amazon, UPS, Walmart, FedEx, Verizon being just a small sample) give tuition reimbursement benefits even for part-time employees so you could lift/load/drive to make ends meet and they\u2019d cover a big pot of your school tuition. \n\nI think it sounds like your parents are expecting you to work full time and give them even more money than you already do when you turn 18. That\u2019s not fair or right. It\u2019s up to you whether you\u2019d like to really mostly be independent of them - your late teens and early 20s can be chaotic and it\u2019s good to have parental support and encouragement \u2026 if they will give you that. But we never have asked for any money from our kids to cover household expenses or rent and even in college their earnings were their fun money, for concerts and clothes, or going out to expensive restaurants with friends. I can\u2019t imagine charging rent unless I was going to hand it back as a gift when they needed a deposit for something. In fact my daughter moved in during Covid and she will use the money she saved on rent towards a down payment on a condo. My younger one wants to move back after grad school and save up for a down payment on a house. A free place to live is an easy gift. It\u2019s something parents of kids under 18 are basically expected to provide under normal circumstances.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why your friend thinks this is messed up.", "Not normal at ALL. Its abusive and wrong. Both of your parents saying thats how it is are WRONG. My kids are MY responsibility. The older kid helping out thing is supposed to be something like watch your brother while I run to the store not pay child support and live in a constant state of lacking for basic needs. Smh im FURIOUS for you. Have a place to move lined up for the minute you turn 18. Do not let her ruin your financial future and mental health any longer.", "It is really really really NOT normal. And it is really really really unfair to you. \n\nBeing taken advantage of this way by your parents is a form of abuse called \"parentification.\" Its called that because the parent is shifting their own responsibilities onto the child/teen, making the child/teen do things the parents should be doing on their own. \n\nSometimes, in case of an emergency, this can't be helped and everyone has to make extraordinary efforts just to stay alive and stay together. But in your case both your parents are working full time, and taking all your money to spend as they see fit is just business as usual. Buying Nintendo Switches for the two boys with your money is not a matter of life and death for anyone.\n\nThey have deliberately brainwashed you into thinking the kids they chose to have are your responsibility when they are not.\n\nRealizing this is going to bring up a lot of hard feelings for you. Its normal to feel sad or angry about it. Maybe read some stuff about parentification and talk to a counsellor (or someone like that) who will respect your confidentiality and not going running to your parents to tell  on you. \n\nGood luck.", "It's not normal. Good you asked for advice, real good. Try to find ways to get out of there, because your story is really bad. Take care, remain hopeful....you will get there!", "No, it isn't. Your mother is making one child (you) pay for the others she has, rather than her paying for all three of you. She says you're entitled but she's giving everything to the younger kids and feels entitled to your wages. There's a difference between helping with the kids (like babysitting occasioy) and funding every treat they and likely your mum has. \n\nShe is lying to you. She does not need 90% of your money for household expenses if you can put enough away to buy 2 Switches. She is expecting you to work so she can have all the reward. \n\nDoes your dad understand how bad this is? She is taking most of your money and making you the third parent to her children. You can't have anything for yourself even though you work because almost everything is given to her. \n\nThis is insane. NTA. If your dad won't help you, find someone who will.

Months may feel a long time but it is best you start prepping immediately\n\nIf you plan to move out the minute you are 18, I encourage to slowly start moving out some of your things (clothes, school awards, teachers' letters of recommendation, old report cards etc) to either your classmate's place (temporarily) or another friend's for safekeeping in case your mother tries to do something funny with them. Have a discussion with your classmate or other friends if you can move in with them temporarily once you turn 18 until you find a place of your own. Do look into academic grants, financial aid and scholarships that can help you if you are planning to go to university or trade school. If you plan to put uni or trade school on hold for a while and focus on a job to earn some money and work experience, it is okay too. Everyone goes according to their pace and there is no right or wrong way to achieve success. There is no such thing as the wrong or right age to graduate from university or trade school either\n\nSecondly, the moment you turn 18 you quickly open up a bank account that only you alone have access to. Talk to the banking people and they will help you. Once you move out, protect your social security number too in case your mother might mess with it until it messes with your credit rating (check to make sure your social security number is not tampered and misused by your mother for taking out loans under your name). Keep your passports, birth certificate and other legal documents under your name away from her too \n\nIf your mother tries to be funny with you when you move out the moment you are 18 by 'threatening' to report to the police that you are kidnapped or gone missing, be very prepared to tell the police that your mother is wasting their time all to keep you from moving out. If the worse comes after you turn 18, time to get a no contact protective order on her and change your mobile number and emails\n\nI wish I can help you more but hope the advice will be of help for you", "Your mother is abusing you.

Whether that's a school teachers or counselor, CPS or their boss, but anyone willing to lend a hand and some advice is going miles ahead of the support they have at the moment.", "If she's already retaining 90% of OP's pay, OP is already paying rent. It sounds like they'd have to join the military to get out.", "Ask your friends parents to help you find a more permanent job and a room to rent OP. Your parents are wrong and you are being exploited here.", "You can even get direct deposit to your CashApp or Venmo account, and they have free debit cards.", "Hopping on top comment.\n\nI feel like public shaming is the only way to go about this. Telling other people at school who may spread it amongst the parents. Social media etc. What is your mom going to do? Kick you out? You will probably be able to save more in shared accommodation.", "She wants to scare OP. She doesn't want OP to realize they are already paying rent.", "You are not an adult. Big difference. When do you get to be a kid?", "You are already paying rent. She just doesn't want you to realize it because you are a minor and you shouldn't be paying rent.\nBack at school do you have some kind of counselor you can go and ask questions? At this rate you will hit 18 and you will have no money so you will be trapped. How are you going to go to college if you can't save any money? Why are you even working if none of the benefits are going to you? Especially if they get switches. Normally you don't give a switch to each child, you get 1 for all the family.\n\nThey don't want you to think any of those things. Does your mom friend know you give all your money to your mom? Start telling anyone and everyone. Your mom bought 2 switch, you give all your money to your mom and you have nothing left, your mom is making you pay rent and you still have an iPhone 6. Tell everyone. Some people will say it is normal a lot will say it is not. You have got nothing to be ashamed of you are being too good a kid.\n\nNTA", "It sounds like OP is working for stepdad\u2019s mate and the cash is given straight to the mother and SD. Then they take their cut and give OP whatever is left. \n\nIANAL but isn\u2019t that kind of illegal? That\u2019s like indentured servitude or something. \n\nINFO: OP I don\u2019t know where you live but there are child labour laws in Western countries Since you can\u2019t rely on your parental units then check the resources at your school. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have a bank account then even if you work for a decade it will be difficult to establish a credit rating with the banks. \n\nA lot of businesses have employment contracts that will outline what you\u2019re supposed to do in your job, how much you\u2019ll get paid and what the conditions and hours are. That is supposed to protect you from being exploited and it also protects the business by ensuring that they don\u2019t break the law by overworking you. \n\nI personally don\u2019t have a problem with kids paying board, but it shouldn\u2019t be more than 10-15% to my mind. Parents are supposed to help their children succeed, not set them up for failure. \n\nYou are definitely NTA, and if the parents of your friend can be trusted, i suggest having a chat to them about finding out whether your job is legitimate or not. If the adults in your life are not protecting you then sadly you\u2019ll need to learn to protect yourself. \n\nGood luck!", "You can still file a return second to the punch. You just have to mail it in the old fashioned way via mail. When the IRS ends up with a situation like this with conflicting returns, one person will be contacted by letter asking for proof.", "I pay my parents \u00a3350 ($400 ish?) a month, your daughter needs to learn she is very lucky with your offer lmao.", "Also find a different job that actually pays you and not your parents. That\u2019s not even legal.", "Yes she doesn\u2019t want OP to realise that. She also wants to take 100% of OP\u2019s money.", "Piggybacking for the very important: your mom and you probably have a joint bank account, the minute you turn 18 get a new bank account at a different bank, or she will continue to take. In the meantime, see if your dad will take you to a separate bank to set up an account, or cash your cheques and keep the money at your dads somewhere safe.\n\nI\u2019m so very sorry to tell you that your mother favours her other children because they are with her new husband and she\u2019s trying to make a nice family without you. That\u2019s the nicest way I can put it, but I\u2019m sick at the idea of how she treats you. Don\u2019t give her any more money, quit your job if you have to. She\u2019s the parent, not you, it\u2019s her responsibility, that\u2019s how life real life works. I\u2019m sorry.", "And free childcare.", "My worries is that they either kick him out because they won\u2019t want to do that, or his share of rent will still be like 90% of his income, still leaving him no money for himself or way to save to be able to move out", "If you live in the United States, no adult pays 84.5% of their salary to taxes. The highest marginal rate is 37% for people earning over $693,750. You are almost certainly at a tax rate where you don't have to pay taxes. Interestingly, if your income is going to your parents, they DO need to claim that and pay taxes on it.", "\"Being an adult\" means not treating your child like a servant and not relying on them to pay your bills for you.\n\nHave you ever seen *Cinderella*? Because that's basically your situation. \n\nNTA and please follow the evolve in the other comments here about saving as much as you can to get out on your own. I'm sorry you're dealing with such a crappy situation. Good luck.", "Absolutely! And even if he asked for a rental agreement when he\u2019s 18, she still try taking 90% of his income leaving him with almost nothing. All while it all goes to spoiling the brother. This is just so wrong!", "Good to know. What happens if they both technically can claim for OP,? Does the person himself get final say?"]}
