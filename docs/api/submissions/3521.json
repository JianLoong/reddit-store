Since I started working, mom asks for 90% of the money I earn to help for house expenses, that includes buying whatever my brothers need, but as a result I barely have any money for myself, sometimes I spend it all in transportation only. \n\nThere was a time when she told me that i'm an entitled, that before getting remarried she spoiled me, and that was a way to teach me how the real world works.\n\nFor my 5yo brother bday in May, she bought him a Nintendo Switch, that seemed weird since they are always complaining about having little money, but I said anything.

Gotta admit, I got a little mad, because I can't afford anything for myself, for example, my phone is an old iPhone 6 that no longer gets updates, and rely on the computer my school gave me for studying. Told her that my brothers already have phones, tablets and a playstation, if she was gonna use the money on another console, I would rather use it on myself and things that I needed. \n\nShe called me entitled, and that is easy for me to say it since im not an adult with children, that all I have to do is study, work and as long as I live under her roof, I have to contribute financially, using money that could go for little brothers on \"stupid things\" was being selfish, and that I dont appreciate how much they as parents do for the 3 of us. Also told me that I'll have to pay rent starting at my 18th bday like a \"real adult\".\n\nI'm still in contact with my dad, but he told me that my mom's expectations for me are normal, and yes, is my responsibility as the older brother to \"help the youngsters\". \n\nI also told this to my classmate, but he says my mom is crazy and I should have money for myself.\n\nIm not sure about anything, that's why im asking here if i'm being entitled or if my mom is wrong.\n\nGotta make clear that both mom and step-dad have full time jobs.", "created_utc": 1669741651, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7zolv/aita_and_am_i_entitled_for_telling_my_mother_i/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I'm saying to look those up is some places depending on your age you have to have an adult open the account and you added. Some places it's different you can open up your own account. I would suggest opening up your own account and then having your paycheck direct deposited. Then I would get a written agreement with your parents for a reasonable amount of rent. Since you're renting a room in a house look at how much renting a room goes for in your area and pay about 25% of that going rate or 35% of your income whichever is easier on you. The reason that you want to get a written agreement is so that they cannot all of the sudden change their mind and say that you owe them your whole paycheck or something like that. You both would get a copy of it with each other's signatures and I would recommend keeping a copy of it digitally as well as a copy of it with a very good friend. Not only do you want to open your own account but you do want to open a separate savings account and also have more than 10% of your income going into that every paycheck. When it comes to money besides thinking about your needs right now you need to think about 5 years down the road as well. When it comes to responsibility of your younger siblings you are responsible for your actions towards them. I would also say being a positive role model. One way you can start being a positive role model is to start being more fiscally responsible and standing up to your parents and providing your younger siblings with a good example of not being taken advantage of by relatives.", "Nta.\n\n>since i'm the oldest, she always mentions that it is my responsibility. \n\nNo its not your responsibility.. it s her and the stepdads.

He is required to put gas in the car (we only have one) to replace what he uses for work and personal stuff. He is required to pay for all fun expenses like meals out with friends and gifts for his girlfriend. He pays for things like his Discord server, video games, any stuff he wants outside of birthdays/holidays/agreed on things. Soon I will have him pay for his portion of the cell phone bill. He does not pay for utilities, household items, basic necessities, etc. as a mom it\u2019s my job to teach him to be responsible both as a contributing member of society and with his money. When he makes dumb purchases and doesn\u2019t have money to go out to eat with his friends that\u2019s a lesson learned. He and I have each other\u2019s cards on our Apple Pay but would never use the other\u2019s without permission. This is, to me, establishing trust and healthy boundaries.

Let me be clear, it is NOT your responsibility to take care of your brothers, it is your mum and step dad.
