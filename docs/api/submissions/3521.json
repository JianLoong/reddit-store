Gotta admit, I got a little mad, because I can't afford anything for myself, for example, my phone is an old iPhone 6 that no longer gets updates, and rely on the computer my school gave me for studying. Told her that my brothers already have phones, tablets and a playstation, if she was gonna use the money on another console, I would rather use it on myself and things that I needed.\n\nShe called me entitled, and that is easy for me to say it since im not an adult with children, that all I have to do is study, work and as long as I live under her roof, I have to contribute financially, using money that could go for little brothers on \"stupid things\" was being selfish, and that I dont appreciate how much they as parents do for the 3 of us. Also told me that I'll have to pay rent starting at my 18th bday like a \"real adult\".\n\nI'm still in contact with my dad, but he told me that my mom's expectations for me are normal, and yes, is my responsibility as the older brother to \"help the youngsters\".\n\nI also told this to my classmate, but he says my mom is crazy and I should have money for myself.\n\nIm not sure about anything, that's why im asking here if i'm being entitled or if my mom is wrong.\n\nGotta make clear that both mom and step-dad have full time jobs.\n\nEdit: Gotta say that 90% was a rough estimate. I did some math and the exact amount I give her based on my current salary is 84.5%.\n\nI have so much to think about, my definition of a \"normal\" family seems to be completely wrong and I dont know what to do. I never questioned if my mom is a bad parent before.

The reason I'm saying to look those up is some places depending on your age you have to have an adult open the account and you added. Some places it's different you can open up your own account. I would suggest opening up your own account and then having your paycheck direct deposited. Then I would get a written agreement with your parents for a reasonable amount of rent. Since you're renting a room in a house look at how much renting a room goes for in your area and pay about 25% of that going rate or 35% of your income whichever is easier on you. The reason that you want to get a written agreement is so that they cannot all of the sudden change their mind and say that you owe them your whole paycheck or something like that. You both would get a copy of it with each other's signatures and I would recommend keeping a copy of it digitally as well as a copy of it with a very good friend. Not only do you want to open your own account but you do want to open a separate savings account and also have more than 10% of your income going into that every paycheck. When it comes to money besides thinking about your needs right now you need to think about 5 years down the road as well. When it comes to responsibility of your younger siblings you are responsible for your actions towards them. I would also say being a positive role model.

He is required to put gas in the car (we only have one) to replace what he uses for work and personal stuff. He is required to pay for all fun expenses like meals out with friends and gifts for his girlfriend. He pays for things like his Discord server, video games, any stuff he wants outside of birthdays/holidays/agreed on things. Soon I will have him pay for his portion of the cell phone bill. He does not pay for utilities, household items, basic necessities, etc. as a mom it\u2019s my job to teach him to be responsible both as a contributing member of society and with his money. When he makes dumb purchases and doesn\u2019t have money to go out to eat with his friends that\u2019s a lesson learned. He and I have each other\u2019s cards on our Apple Pay but would never use the other\u2019s without permission. This is, to me, establishing trust and healthy boundaries.

No, what your mom is doing is not normal. It\u2019s not loving and it\u2019s not particularly maternal.  I did contribute to household expenses and paid \u201crent\u201d but only after I had graduated from college and chose to live with my parents because I appreciated the security of having people I know and trust always around.", "Nta not normal.", "NTA, but your mom & sd are BIG TIME! That\u2019s YOUR money! I\u2019d tell them you aren\u2019t working anymore & stop giving them money immediately. Try to find a way to work without them knowing. You\u2019ll never be able to move out if you don\u2019t stop this right away!! I know. Probably easier said than done. Best of luck to you!\n\nMaybe you can talk to some of your friends parents about this. I know I\u2019d do whatever I could to help if this was happening to one of my kid\u2019s friends!!! Or the school counselor. This is just so wrong!", "NTA at ALL! I\u2019m 20F and though i don\u2019t have younger siblings. this is crazy to me. i have also had jobs since 16, and my parents didn\u2019t expect anything from me. nor did they expect me to pay rent when i turned 18. i still live with them currently. the boys are not yours to take care of. i would move out as soon as i turned 18 if i were you. this just seems crazy to me. it might be hard to move out that young but you\u2019re working a lot it sounds. open your own bank account as soon as you turn 18, and get a job that is not connected to your mom or step-dad asap, it sounds like that it hindering your pay as well. i wish you the best, and hope you can figure it out soon.", "THIS! Leave, she\u2019s taking advantage of you!  Babysitting services aren\u2019t free, also she would probably start freaking out the moment you move out as her additional ATM and free babysitter is now gone. \n\nFamily don\u2019t treat family the way she manipulates and takes advantage of you!", "Ding ding ding! This OP", "Forget it, because Mom isn't playing fair. She's brainwashed him into thinking its okay that she takes all his money. She's not going to sit down in good faith and sign a contract. This will just prolong the drama. \n\nHe needs to squirrel away as much as he can and leave at the earliest chance.", "OP is under 18. OP should not have to pay for room and board. OP needs to save every penny and get ready to leave once the hit 18.", "No, he is entitled to keep his money. It is literally his. Entitled is not a bad word. It doesn't mean spoiled, and it doesn't mean wrong or mistaken. He is entitled to keep his money and that is totally appropriate.", "NTA if you can move out as soon as possible", "\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d This!", "this^^this", "It is not normal, especially not normal to then use that money to give expensive gifts to a sibling. I can understand if things were very tight asking you to contribute some of your earnings to the household but NOT 90%. I\u2019m guessing somehow your parents just got greedy and they\u2019ve convinced themselves this is normal and persuaded themselves and you that you\u2019d be \u201cselfish\u201d to keep your earnings. Most people in the US who can afford expensive gaming equipment would be shocked and appalled. That\u2019s taking advantage of your kid almost to the point of slavery/human trafficking. \n\nI\u2019m going to suggest you reduce the percentage you give her to more like 50, which is still too much. I think at most asking a teen to give 30% plus paying for their own phone and clothes/transit is reasonable, and that\u2019s only if your family is seriously struggling even with both parents working full time. \n\nSave the rest of the money somewhere your parents don\u2019t know about and can\u2019t get a hold of. Until 18 you need an adult co-signer on a bank account but maybe a friend, cousin or grandparent could help you? The mom of the friend who told you this isn\u2019t right?  \n\nYou need to save up a cash cushion so you can move out. Rent is never supposed to be 90% of your pay and salaries in an area reflect that. You should be able to split on an apartment and still have money left for food, career training, fun and extras especially if you can start to work more hours. \n\nHonestly I\u2019m wondering if you could qualify for legal emancipation before age 18. You need a place to live independently, and a job that covers your expenses. Maybe someone would be willing to let you stay with their elderly relative as a home helper so they aren\u2019t alone at night and actually pay you live there. Or maybe you could find a job as a live-in nanny. Either way you\u2019d have actual cash for your work and not be handing it all over to the people providing the roof over your head. Frankly I think a judge would consider taking 90% of your pay unreasonable and grant you autonomy on those grounds, but check the rules in your state/country. \n\nIn the US, if you are declared legally emancipated you can get financial aid for college or other training without your parents and any income they have being considered. You wouldn\u2019t need them to file FAFSA so you\u2019d qualify for maximum aid. You could get about $7k in Pell grant aid which should cover most of the cost CC courses, either those working towards an academic degree or towards some kind of skill training program. You would likely also qualify for assistance from your state, for income tax credits worth another $2k, and possibly grants from universities as well. If you aren\u2019t emancipated your parents may still choose to claim you as a dependent to reduce their taxes (instead of your taxes going down) and you will have to work with them on any school finance paperwork. That\u2019s the incentive to resolve this early. \n\nAnother option to keep in mind: Starbucks offers employees free online degrees through Arizona State, which has very solid programs in dozens of majors. If you\u2019d like working there, you could cover rent and living expenses that way and have free school. Other companies (Amazon, UPS, Walmart, FedEx, Verizon being just a small sample) give tuition reimbursement benefits even for part-time employees so you could lift/load/drive to make ends meet and they\u2019d cover a big pot of your school tuition. \n\nI think it sounds like your parents are expecting you to work full time and give them even more money than you already do when you turn 18. That\u2019s not fair or right. It\u2019s up to you whether you\u2019d like to really mostly be independent of them - your late teens and early 20s can be chaotic and it\u2019s good to have parental support and encouragement \u2026 if they will give you that. But we never have asked for any money from our kids to cover household expenses or rent and even in college their earnings were their fun money, for concerts and clothes, or going out to expensive restaurants with friends. I can\u2019t imagine charging rent unless I was going to hand it back as a gift when they needed a deposit for something. In fact my daughter moved in during Covid and she will use the money she saved on rent towards a down payment on a condo. My younger one wants to move back after grad school and save up for a down payment on a house. A free place to live is an easy gift. It\u2019s something parents of kids under 18 are basically expected to provide under normal circumstances.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why your friend thinks this is messed up.", "Not normal at ALL. Its abusive and wrong. Both of your parents saying thats how it is are WRONG. My kids are MY responsibility. The older kid helping out thing is supposed to be something like watch your brother while I run to the store not pay child support and live in a constant state of lacking for basic needs. Smh im FURIOUS for you. Have a place to move lined up for the minute you turn 18. Do not let her ruin your financial future and mental health any longer.", "It is really really really NOT normal. And it is really really really unfair to you. \n\nBeing taken advantage of this way by your parents is a form of abuse called \"parentification.\" Its called that because the parent is shifting their own responsibilities onto the child/teen, making the child/teen do things the parents should be doing on their own. \n\nSometimes, in case of an emergency, this can't be helped and everyone has to make extraordinary efforts just to stay alive and stay together. But in your case both your parents are working full time, and taking all your money to spend as they see fit is just business as usual. Buying Nintendo Switches for the two boys with your money is not a matter of life and death for anyone.\n\nThey have deliberately brainwashed you into thinking the kids they chose to have are your responsibility when they are not.\n\nRealizing this is going to bring up a lot of hard feelings for you. Its normal to feel sad or angry about it. Maybe read some stuff about parentification and talk to a counsellor (or someone like that) who will respect your confidentiality and not going running to your parents to tell  on you. \n\nGood luck.", "It's not normal. Good you asked for advice, real good. Try to find ways to get out of there, because your story is really bad. Take care, remain hopeful....you will get there!", "No, it isn't. Your mother is making one child (you) pay for the others she has, rather than her paying for all three of you. She says you're entitled but she's giving everything to the younger kids and feels entitled to your wages. There's a difference between helping with the kids (like babysitting occasioy) and funding every treat they and likely your mum has. \n\nShe is lying to you. She does not need 90% of your money for household expenses if you can put enough away to buy 2 Switches. She is expecting you to work so she can have all the reward. \n\nDoes your dad understand how bad this is? She is taking most of your money and making you the third parent to her children. You can't have anything for yourself even though you work because almost everything is given to her. \n\nThis is insane. NTA. If your dad won't help you, find someone who will. You need to take your money and run (and BTW, when the house is empty you should grab your birth certificate and all important documents, because when  you do want to leave, she is not going to want to hand them over).", "My step-dad was thw worst human being I have ever had to share a house with and even he didn't take 90% of my money.", "NTA.\n\nMy mom wouldn't take a cent from me. My spouse and I took her in and I have to hide ways to give her money sometimes.\n\nThis is not normal.", "Absolutely not normal. We had a hard time with money when my kids were teens and never once did I tell them they had to contribute to anything. They received allowance and were encouraged to get jobs, but not required to. They only started working and helping with rent and bills after they graduated high school at 18.", "no it really isn\u2019t\n\nthis is how i feel whenever i tell my best friend about stuff my parents did/do and she\u2019s like \u201cmy mom hasn\u2019t done anything like this ever.\u201d you live with it and you think that\u2019s just how the world works but she shouldn\u2019t be using you as a personal atm", "its not supposed to be.  i hope you get some help.", "Absolutely not.

She is the parent. She needs to actually parent and not leech off of her oldest kid. \n\nNTA OP, and my advice is as soon as a you turn 18 look for somewhere else to live.

Your dad probably just agreed because he doesn\u2019t want to deal with your mother and, clearly, has no intention to be a parent to you either. \n\nThis is not normal. You are being exploited.
