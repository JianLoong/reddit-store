{"id": 6496, "submission_id": "103ez4r", "title": "AITA for yelling at a cashier who asked me to donate to St. Jude?", "selftext": "At the grocery store earlier the cashier asked me if I wanted to donate to St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital. I declined and the cashier asked if I was sure. \u2026I said yes\u2026I\u2019m sure. I was confused as to why there needed to be a convo about it.\n\nI inserted my card and while I\u2019m waiting for it to process he says \u201cSo you can wear Nike but you can\u2019t donate to some kids?\u201d I swear I saw red. For context- I\u2019m gay and my parents kicked me out for it a few months ago. Stuff has been super rough and I was buying a $4 box of Ramen and dog food. My job had some pipes burst in the cold weather so I\u2019ve been out of work for 3 weeks and the nearby food pantries also have a lot of water damage so they\u2019re closed. I had $18 after rent this week (now $6). Needless to say, I\u2019m really struggling and constantly hungry.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t know that, nor did he need to. I said excuse me and he started picking apart my outfit (hat and shirt). I stood there for a second trying to figure out if he was actually serious. He stepped to the side to look over the counter and said \u201cAnd Nike shoes too.\u201d I completely lost it. I cussed him out and said he can go fuck himself and donate his whole paycheck if he cares so much. I\u2019ll admit I made a huge scene. The assistant manager came over because I was yelling and I explained the situation. The guy interrupted and told his manager that his brother had cancer and St. Jude saved him. I told him that\u2019s not a reason to berate customers and walked out before there was any resolution.\n\nCan\u2019t lie, I got on the bus and teared up because of the stress I\u2019ve been under these past few weeks. My job is opening back up on Monday but that\u2019s still 2 1/2 weeks until a paycheck. I\u2019ve been insanely hungry and even had to buy cheaper dog food (the sudden switch has messed up her stomach). I understand he\u2019s probably frustrated with people not donating, but that shouldn\u2019t give him the right to criticize people. I acted out of emotion but also feel like he shouldn\u2019t be judging people off looks. Little does he know I can\u2019t even feed myself.", "created_utc": 1672866215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103ez4r/aita_for_yelling_at_a_cashier_who_asked_me_to/", "score": 528, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe even namedrop the guy if he had a nametag on", "NTA.  Cashier crossed the line with the NIKE comment. At that point I wish you came had a good comeback. \n\u201cOh and how much of your salary do you donate?\u201d\n\u201cThe company you work for wants ME to donate but they don\u2019t even pay YOU a decent wage\u201d\n\u201cWell I could donate if I hadn\u2019t spent all my money on my shoes, why don\u2019t you donate for me instead?\u201d\n\nOr whatever. You, my friend, are NTA!!!", "NTA\n\nI don't donate through stores, ever. It allows them to take credit for the donation, get the tax break, and look like they are giving. I get really annoyed when big box stores ask, especially when they are making lots of money. THEY can donate and not ask customers.\n\nI will donate to causes I have vetted, trust, or local places.\n\nHe is an asshole for coming at you for your outfit, without knowing what you are going through. My parents went through a hard time financially when I was in middle school. We were not starving, but a lot of things were sold to make ends meet. My Mom always bought nicer clothing, so they would last, and people made comments about how she was \"doing fine\" if she had a designer bag (from a decade ago).", "NTA. A donation should be voluntary and this cashier was absolutely out of line, irrespective of whether his brother existed or not.", "NTA.  I\u2019ve never heard of a cashier/employee giving such incredible disrespect to someone for not donating.  Unreal.  My jaw would drop.\n\nNow I while agree that cursing them off wasn\u2019t the best way to go about it in hindsight (yeah just politely ask for the manager and watch them shit bricks), it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.  It just means you impulsively reacted with disregard for how it\u2019d make you look instead of making a cold, calculated response.  But your impulsive reaction wasn\u2019t anything that the cashier didn\u2019t deserve, so you\u2019re not an asshole.\n\nAnd honestly, good work bringing attention to the cashier\u2019s shitty behavior.  You probably weren\u2019t the first person he lit into like this, just the first one that made him regret doing so to.", "NTA - And honestly? I would have not stopped until he got fired, you don't get to berate people for not doing XYZ with their own fcking money.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like two things happened here.  \n\nFirst, the cashier was an AH.  these companies put pressure on their employees to try to get donations so the company looks good.  The fact the cashier\u2019s family had a personal experience probably encourages that cashier to exert a little more energy in gathering donations, but it should simply be a \u201c would you like to donate\u201d and when the customer says no, they should drop it.  This cashier chose to attack you instead.\n\nSecond, it came a a time of great stress and hit a nerve.  Sometimes when that happens, we react, which you did.  It doesn\u2019t make you an AH, it makes you human.  \n\nNow, I\u2019m thrilled you are getting back to work.  Did you file for unemployment for the time you were out of work?  If not, please do so ASAP.  Often, being out for a couple of weeks in a situation like this it will kick in.  \n\nIs there a shelter where you can get extra help?  Did you apply for SNAP?  Sometimes you can get emergency food assistance from SNAP when you are suddenly out of work like this, and will have what sounds like 5 weeks between paychecks.  \n\nIs there a LGBTQA+ shelter or support group where you are?  Sometimes they have resources or know of resources for short term assistance, especially due to you being kicked out by your parents. \n\nGood luck", "NTA - and I\u2019m sorry your parents kicked you out.  Please remember you\u2019re not alone and there is community that can help.", "NTA. He pushed when he shouldn\u2019t have. The should have taken no and not made it personal", "NTA.  The cashier is definitely an AH and it should be obvious to anyone.", "NTA I'm sorry for what you're going through Hun.", "NTA the cashier is the one that escalated and turned it into a big confrontation. I wouldn't handle that well, either.", "Very NTA.  You were right to chastise worker.", "NTA. He didn't become the asshole by asking, he became the asshole when he persisted, and then passed judgement on you, not knowing your situation.", "NTA. Asking once is enough. Anything more than that is undue pressure.", "NTA \n\nThe cashier was grossly unprofessional and crossed the line by starting to pick on your appearance. It\u2019s none of his business why you don\u2019t want to donate. He shouldn\u2019t have started trying to bully/guilt you into it. \n\nYour reaction of yelling at him wasn\u2019t great, but it sounds like you are under a large amount of stress right now. I\u2019m sorry that you are going through so much. It genuinely sounds like you aren\u2019t a bad person, but just had the final straw be in the form of some nitwit cashier. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re in the states, but if you are I hope that you are able to reach out and get unemployment for the three weeks you\u2019ve been off work. If your state is going through a lot of cold/damage there might be an emergency relief pantries set up through churches, Red Cross, soup kitchens or other relief areas. Please reach out if you want any help with more specific ideas, I\u2019d be more than willing to google around and see if there anything in your area.", "NTA.  I won't let them \"round up\" to the nearest dollar anywhere after I heard the companies use customers' donations for their tax purposes.  Apparently, these companies use the total amount customers donate when they file taxes. They didn't donate the money the customers did, but they count it towards their donations and take the tax break. Screw them.  I'll donate directly", "NTA\n\n- Friends don\u2019t know everything going on in someone\u2019s life let alone strangers\n\n- Anyone who makes a donation through a store like that allowing them to get a tax write off should be ashamed. \n\n- Many people make private donations to charities that support causes that they have a personal impact on them. Does this cashier think it\u2019s okay for me to walk up to him and publicly berate him for not donating to the ALS Foundation, or the Suicide Prevention hotline? \n\nI\u2019m sorry for what your going through right now, this cashier is an asshole and so are your parents.", "NTA - He was way out of line, he does not know your or anybody else's life, and has no right to try and guilt trip anyone into donating, no matter how important the cause is for him personally.\nYour screaming at him might be over the top for a normal day, but sounds to me like you were at the end of your rope already and he just gave you the final push.  You could have been more constructive, but that does not make his behavior OK!", "NTA and I would complain to head office.", "Oh, honey, NTA. I'm so sorry for what you're having to go through. \n\nYou are so strong, and you're doing such a good job, and I hope you know that. For all the hate in this world, there is so much love. Do what you must to weather this storm, but please don't forget that you are worthy of love, and that there are people out there just waiting to meet you, know you, and love you.", "NTA, I would have gone off too and I am not in your situation.", "You said no, that should have been the end of it. Yet he kept pressuring to the point of harassing you. **NTA**", "NTA. I really wish retailers would stop with the beggar routine at the cash register. Most don\u2019t take it to the extreme that this oblivious AH did. If I were his manager, I would fire him for harassing a customer.", "NTA at all. The cashier made a LOT of assumptions, and that's not okay. Yes, as a former cashier myself, I know that they are mandated to ask every customer, but this cashier took it way too far, even to the point of stopping your purchase midway through to berate you for wearing \"luxury\" brands? 100% is not okay. That cashier should've been fired on the spot or at the least reported to their union, regardless of the cancer situation with his brother, which I am sympathetic to.\n\nHonestly, though, the real AHs are the grocery chains who \"donate\" money to charities in this way. They take the credit for giving all this money to a good cause, making themselves look like great, stand-up companies, when it's really the customers giving more of their hard-earned money for the good of other people and grocery stores shouldn't be shaming people into donating or shaming them when they don't.", "NTA I work for a nonprofit and ask for donations from people regularly in the course of my job. I do not ever give at stores like this. That company uses your money to take tax breaks. If I am going to donate to St. Jude I'm going to do it myself directly. It's okay for the cashier to ask you once, but to push it is totally out of line.\n\nAs for your reaction, you are under extreme stress and hungry. And the cashier hit one of the things that is stressing you out at the moment. Did you overreact? Yes. Is it understandable? Also, yes.\n\nEdit: I see that I was conflating those \"portion of this sale goes to charity\" campaigns and the \"do you want to donate a dollar\" campaigns. My bad. I'll still be donating myself to smaller orgs that I have researched, but I'll be less severe about this thing. (Cashier is still totally out of line for pushing.)", "My favorite was when a store asked me to donate to the Mary Kate and Ashley Foundation. I think my response was something like, two 20-year-old billionaires need me to donate to their foundation? You must be fucking kidding me.", "NTA. Oh sweetie, I am SO sorry this happened to you.", "NTA. Furthermore, even if you were in a position to donate, why would you surrender the tax credit for charitable donations to a corporate entity to claim on theirs? That's just stupid.", "NTA.\n\nYou were under a lot of pressure with your current situation. You were asked. You said no. When the cashier continued to ask, they crossed a line. Evaluating your outfit for how much money you have is stupid as well. You could have bought the outfit at a thrift store. I hope your situation gets better.", "NTA. I have plenty of money but very often do not choose to donate at the register. I carefully research what I donate to. I don't know wtf Walgreens is doing with my donation before it gets to st.Jude. are there fees? Processing fees, whatever. Doesn't matter. I want every cent I give to go the organizations I choose. Not all charities are great at managing money. Not talking about St.Jude I donate them often. Many are better than others to donate to so I research and do my own gifting. This guy clearly was having a terrible day or something and it's sad he's going through what hes going through but it's not cool that he judged you. We all need to remember we have no idea what's going on in any strangers life. Be more forgiving.", "NTA. This is simple chugging...charity mugging. \n\nI donate to specific charities whose cause I believe in and say so to persistent chuggers. This guy was way out of line. Hope your situation improves very soon.", "NTA companies could donate significantly more than their customers can. And customers donating through them allows for tax write offs for the companies. I will never donate through them\n\nAnd the cashier was a dick calling you out just because he's bias. I would've gotten snappy too with him", "NTA. I would write to the head office and complain as you\u2019re probably not the only person he\u2019s pulled this on. At the very least the employee needs to be reprimanded and coached as his behaviour was out of line. You probably should have just ignored it or told him to mind his own business, as jerks like this aren\u2019t worth your energy, but I don\u2019t blame you for being upset.", "NTA. The cashiers attitude was completely uncalled for. If you choose not to donate, it's not their business, they ask once and if you say no it means NO. they don't know your background. You can be making donations otherwise. You may be short on money. It doesn't matter. You're not obligated to make donations, no matter what you're wearing. It's YOUR money and up to you what you choose to do with it. He's TA. I hope the manager teared him a new one. Sadly you didn't stay to see the result.\n\nI'm so sorry this is happening to you and that your parents kicked you out. I really hope things get better eventually, keep strong!", "NTA. I never ever donate through any big box store. These companies make millions of dollars and then donate to these charities so they can get a tax write off but the company isn't even the one donating! They ask their customers for the donations and then reap the benefits. If you want to donate, do it on your own terms.", "NTA.\n\nif you ask me, anyone paid to harass you for your time or money instantly deserves gloves off treatment after the first no. I don't care if you're looking for a donation for a good cause, hocking a skin care routine at a mall kiosk, or trying to upsell on a transaction. If your job is to be aggressive with me, then I have no problem getting aggressive with you.", "NTA. It stinks his brother has cancer but lambasting customers for donations is not the way to help his sibling.

I work in retail the cashier should have dropped it at the first no.", "NTA\n\nOhhhh. He is probably the kind of person who bitches online when he see someone use a LINK card but is wearing stuff he considers too expensive. Dude is a sanctimonious arse.", "NTA! Clearly this person didn\u2019t know the money is already donated, his employer is just recouping costs from customers. \nI\u2019m so so sorry, you did not deserve to be treated this way", "NTA.

The answer is NO. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you!", "NTA. He had no right to try to force you to donate.", "nta.  I do not donate through the stores.  If it's a worthwhile fundraiser, I'll donate to them personally.", "NTA.\n\nI will never donate at the register so a corporation can receive a tax deduction. Why should I help them avoid taxes while they underpay employees?", "NTA. I *never* give money to charities in this way. The companies give the donations to the charity, but get a huge tax write-off as if it were their own donation. That's the only reason all these stores are \"supporting charities,\" and asking you to add a few cents on every time you shop there.\n\nIf you want to give money to a charity, give it to them directly.", "NTA. \n\nMy god I hate these types of people that push to donate money to charities. I only have two charities that I fully support and that\u2019s it. One is animal rescue shelter that survives off donations from the public aside from when Covid hit that they government funding but that was it. The other one is The Ronald McDonald House which is charity for kids with cancer here in Australia. \n\nI granted I spend most of my time volunteering at my local animal rescue shelter because I prefer animals over people most days. And they need the extra help throughout the day. But usual when someone says no that\u2019s it. That cashier should of had more respect for you when you said no.", "NTA, He didn't ask, he harassed and judged you. That that manager was going to explain that cashier's story was also bad.

Also, people are in circumstances like yours where maybe they could afford it 2 months ago but cant now. Those donations are usually just a huge tax write off for the stores anyways, if the store really cared about donating to the charities they would just write a check and send it, but they would rather collect donations and send them so they can get tax relief. You did good, screw that cashier.", "NTA charitable donations should be freely given. He was harassing you.\n\nIt doesn't matter what you're wearing, what you're buying, he still had no right to push it once the question was asked and answered.", "NTA.

But there was no reason for him to get that upset, especially when he doesn't know everyone's financial status and situation. Hope you're able to get over this hump!\n\nEdit: everyone saying that you should have tried your hardest to get this guy fired needs to seriously reconsider how they interact with the world. Just as he didn't know your situation and acted in an inappropriate manner, doing something like getting him fired over being emotional that his brother had cancer (which was essentially what it boiled down to) is extremely disturbing. Everyone needs to learn how to treat people with grace.", "NTA. I hate those donations at the register programs.

I was confused as to why there needed to be a convo about it.\n\nI inserted my card and while I\u2019m waiting for it to process he says \u201cSo you can wear Nike but you can\u2019t donate to some kids?\u201d I swear I saw red. For context- I\u2019m gay and my parents kicked me out for it a few months ago. Stuff has been super rough and I was buying a $4 box of Ramen and dog food. My job had some pipes burst in the cold weather so I\u2019ve been out of work for 3 weeks and the nearby food pantries also have a lot of water damage so they\u2019re closed. I had $18 after rent this week (now $6). Needless to say, I\u2019m really struggling and constantly hungry.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t know that, nor did he need to. I said excuse me and he started picking apart my outfit (hat and shirt). I stood there for a second trying to figure out if he was actually serious. He stepped to the side to look over the counter and said \u201cAnd Nike shoes too.\u201d I completely lost it. I cussed him out and said he can go fuck himself and donate his whole paycheck if he cares so much. I\u2019ll admit I made a huge scene. The assistant manager came over because I was yelling and I explained the situation. The guy interrupted and told his manager that his brother had cancer and St. Jude saved him. I told him that\u2019s not a reason to berate customers and walked out before there was any resolution.\n\nCan\u2019t lie, I got on the bus and teared up because of the stress I\u2019ve been under these past few weeks. My job is opening back up on Monday but that\u2019s still 2 1/2 weeks until a paycheck. I\u2019ve been insanely hungry and even had to buy cheaper dog food (the sudden switch has messed up her stomach). I understand he\u2019s probably frustrated with people not donating, but that shouldn\u2019t give him the right to criticize people. I acted out of emotion but also feel like he shouldn\u2019t be judging people off looks. Little does he know I can\u2019t even feed myself.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No should be enough!", "It wasn't even an overreaction. He was HARASSING YOU. I would have yelled at him too. NTA.", "Hey OP I just thought I'd mention r/randomactsofpetfood you might be able to get some help with food for your doggo there. I'm so sorry your struggling, anyone know of a sub that OP might be able to get some help for some food for themselves?\n\nI remember someone mentioning these guys a while ago you might be able to get a free lasamgna here :) -https://www.lasagnalove.org/request/\n\nEdit-added the link", "You should call the store to follow up on the situation. Explain that you are dealing with your own losses at the moment and that that cashier needs to be educated fully on just how inappropriate they were. And that YOU would like an apology.\n\nI think the apology will go a long way in helping you take in that this was not your fault and you are NTA. Also, could you imagine him doing that to someone who\u2019s family member has cancer? Not to minimize your situation at all. \n\nBottom line, you deserve to shop in peace.", "It doesn\u2019t matter where you got it. You could have just donated $5000 to a different cancer charity the day before. Either way it\u2019s none of his business.", "Are you & doggo going to be ok? Do you need anything from a random internet stranger?", "Hey I'm really sorry about what your parents did to you. I'm gay but was fortunate to have parents who mostly accepted me. It's not lost on me the positive effect not getting kicked out and being supported had on my finances so many years later. I'm very fortunate. I'm sure you don't usually blow up at people like that and I think you can forgive yourself for it. Shit happens we aren't always perfect. I can't imagine the hurt you are feeling right now for what your parents did to you. It's disgusting to me that anyone could do that to their kid. I hope things look up for you soon.", "PetCo makes me mad bc the prices are already insane", "What you could do is tell HO that you don\u2019t want him fired but would like them to coach him on how to handle it when customers decline to donate. It\u2019s not an ok thing that he\u2019s doing, and he needs to stop it.\n\nBut if you\u2019re not comfortable with doing that that\u2019s perfectly ok. Odds are his behaviour will get him in trouble eventually.", "Oops. Also NTA", "Don't really agree. We don't have control over how we feel, but we have control of how we behave. Some people have developed more of these skills for managing stress and emotions than others. If it's something you struggle with, it's understandable and forgivable, but it is also something you are responsible for working on.", "[deleted]", "Good for you homie", "Thanks for pointing that out! Fixed!", "That's the word! Consideration! It lacks nowadays big time.", "Well, I just did and guess what?  My opinion didn't change.", "I worked two hellish tears in retail. We got nagged non-fucking-stop if we didn\u2019t sell enough charity candy.", "I still have a really nice St. Jude\u2019s grill set I got from when I worked grocery. I also had a portable speaker right after they came out that the St. Jude\u2019s emblem (it didn\u2019t work very well, but it was nice nonetheless). We didn\u2019t get monetary bonuses, but there were tiers for certain goodies if you got so many donations. Also, the person with highest amount of donations from each store was entered into a raffle or something for an all expense paid trip.", "and...?", "I'm sorry that happened to you, but it sounds like they were both in a state of very high emotion. They both deserve empathy and grace", "Dude, you guys are absolutely ruthless for no reason. You don't just get over your brother having cancer the second they're in remission. Even OP agreed that he deserved empathy and understanding. Why are you going above and beyond on his behalf when he doesn't even agree with you. \n\nHis rage probably culminated over a period of time of people not wanting to or even getting upset about being asked. I sincerely pray that no one would treat you with such ruthless hatred in the event that you made a mistake.", "I agree. I never said that cashier was in the right. In fact, I said that He was wrong to do what he did. But two wrongs doesn't make a right. And I also never said that OP was the asshole in the situation. All I said was that there's absolutely no reason to get someone fired for something like this. It's nice to know that there are so many people that are just out here trying to ruin people's livelihoods because they were wrong and made a mistake. I hope you never make a mistake ever again in your life,", "Okay, again, it sounds like his brother having cancer was very fresh in his mind, which is why he was so emotional about it. People have wronged me and not ever do I think that I would like to make that person's life a living hell. Two wrongs doesn't make a right, but treating a person with understanding and empathy goes a long way in teaching them how to do the same to others.", "Seems like you are NTA in most things. Good on you. I hope things turn around for you.", "Exactly!", "Ha thanks. My priority is my dog. She doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. She just knows we\u2019re in a new place and is as happy as she could be. Love her", "I don\u2019t know of a specific sub, but OP could try calling their local animal shelter or rescue to see if they have a pet food pantry. Many of them do.", "True true. Nothing to prove", "Who said anything about hundreds of cashiers? This was one person on a random Wednesday in January.", "  Yup, but no bonus if you sold your \"quota\"", "I got no bonus, which i don't care about, but I got yelled at if the customer didn't donate. If they did donate, I got yelled at because it was never enough. \n\nThe worst part was the charity was owned by the company (literally has the company name in the title). They can cut into their own profits if they want donations so bad but that's not in the spirit of capitalism.", "Ikr, how dare this organization... raise money for the homeless???", "Thank you. I can see your point, maybe a nice chat between OP, cashier and supervisor might have cleared some thing up.", "You don't take out your personal problems on customers in the customer service industry. No ifs ands or buts about it", "You know, I've managed to get to 40 without causing a customer to leave my place of business in tears for doing nothing at all. I actually thought that was like the minimum standard for an employee in a customer facing job.", "How is holding someone accountable for their actions a \u201cwrong\u201d?", "> Okay, again, it sounds like his brother having cancer was very fresh in his mind, which is why he was so emotional about it.\n\nOkay. I\u2019ve lost both parents and a few cousins to cancer. Want to talk to me about how emotional it felt? Or how quickly I \u201cgot over it\u201d? It\u2019s precisely **no reason or excuse** for berating others for not donating to healthcare charities. \n\nThat\u2019s just rude and wrong because none of us know what the other person is going through, or what they might donate in terms of their own time or money without needing the help of the store or cashier to donate? More than that, it\u2019s arrogant; who am I to say that my \u201cemotional feelings\u201d about my family are more important than someone else\u2019s circumstances? Who are you or that cashier to say the same? How dare you pontificate on that here? How dare that cashier berate others they know nothing about?", "Take her strength and happiness to help you through the next weeks. It will get better, it's just for a very little while now. I once was left with something like 15 dollars for 2 weeks and I felt so humiliated. I went to visit friends and when they invited me to stay for a meal I was so happy...I didn't dare to tell them that I'd not eat if it wasn't at their place. I had pasta all the time and scraped up all left overs I could find.\n\nThe important thing is: this doesn't define you, this rough time says nothing about you and the good you can bring! You got a dog that loves you and is happy to be with you, you are a good person for taking care of her.", "Same with me.", "People in the service industry are people too, and they make mistakes. I don't know how many times I have to say that yes, the cashier was in the wrong.", "Well you're obviously so much of a better person than this cashier. Actually, customer service as a whole should put you on a pedestal, maybe even make busts of you to place in every store in the entire world, so that every cashier might have such a great example to look up to", "Oh god. As a charity professional this goes against all our fundraising ethics. No one should be pressured into fundraising and absolutely no one should have their livelihood affected by fundraising. Not even professional fundraisers like myself - commission based pay is massively frowned upon and against our code of ethics.", "And mistakes have consequences in this case it should have been termination of employment", "Yeah, how the fuck dare I expect...checks notes...people to do their jobs without upsetting customers. \n\nI guess no one is going to erect any busts of you for your quality worth ethic and ability to make tough decisions. And I'm sure you wouldn't change your tune at all if it were you or your child who came home crying after this incident. Hell you'd buy the cashier lunch because they're obviously having a bad day, right?", "I pray that you are treated with more grace by people than you offer to others. Seek help", "You must not know me very well, because yes I absolutely would do something like by the cashier lunch. There's always something going on behind the scenes with someone.", "I don't need your prayers you can keep em. The only person that needs to seek help is the cashier", "No that's all right, you can have my prayers! They're free, and you can't stop me \u2764\ufe0f"]}
