{"id": 6496, "submission_id": "103ez4r", "title": "AITA for yelling at a cashier who asked me to donate to St. Jude?", "selftext": "At the grocery store earlier the cashier asked me if I wanted to donate to St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital. I declined and the cashier asked if I was sure. \u2026I said yes\u2026I\u2019m sure. I was confused as to why there needed to be a convo about it.\n\nI inserted my card and while I\u2019m waiting for it to process he says \u201cSo you can wear Nike but you can\u2019t donate to some kids?\u201d I swear I saw red. For context- I\u2019m gay and my parents kicked me out for it a few months ago. Stuff has been super rough and I was buying a $4 box of Ramen and dog food. My job had some pipes burst in the cold weather so I\u2019ve been out of work for 3 weeks and the nearby food pantries also have a lot of water damage so they\u2019re closed. I had $18 after rent this week (now $6). Needless to say, I\u2019m really struggling and constantly hungry.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t know that, nor did he need to. I said excuse me and he started picking apart my outfit (hat and shirt). I stood there for a second trying to figure out if he was actually serious. He stepped to the side to look over the counter and said \u201cAnd Nike shoes too.\u201d I completely lost it. I cussed him out and said he can go fuck himself and donate his whole paycheck if he cares so much. I\u2019ll admit I made a huge scene. The assistant manager came over because I was yelling and I explained the situation. The guy interrupted and told his manager that his brother had cancer and St. Jude saved him. I told him that\u2019s not a reason to berate customers and walked out before there was any resolution.\n\nCan\u2019t lie, I got on the bus and teared up because of the stress I\u2019ve been under these past few weeks. My job is opening back up on Monday but that\u2019s still 2 1/2 weeks until a paycheck. I\u2019ve been insanely hungry and even had to buy cheaper dog food (the sudden switch has messed up her stomach). I understand he\u2019s probably frustrated with people not donating, but that shouldn\u2019t give him the right to criticize people. I acted out of emotion but also feel like he shouldn\u2019t be judging people off looks. Little does he know I can\u2019t even feed myself.", "created_utc": 1672866215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103ez4r/aita_for_yelling_at_a_cashier_who_asked_me_to/", "score": 7503, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

THEY can donate and not ask customers.\n\nI will donate to causes I have vetted, trust, or local places.\n\nHe is an asshole for coming at you for your outfit, without knowing what you are going through. My parents went through a hard time financially when I was in middle school. We were not starving, but a lot of things were sold to make ends meet. My Mom always bought nicer clothing, so they would last, and people made comments about how she was \"doing fine\" if she had a designer bag (from a decade ago).", "NTA. A donation should be voluntary and this cashier was absolutely out of line, irrespective of whether his brother existed or not.", "NTA.  I\u2019ve never heard of a cashier/employee giving such incredible disrespect to someone for not donating.  Unreal.  My jaw would drop.\n\nNow I while agree that cursing them off wasn\u2019t the best way to go about it in hindsight (yeah just politely ask for the manager and watch them shit bricks), it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.  It just means you impulsively reacted with disregard for how it\u2019d make you look instead of making a cold, calculated response.  But your impulsive reaction wasn\u2019t anything that the cashier didn\u2019t deserve, so you\u2019re not an asshole.\n\nAnd honestly, good work bringing attention to the cashier\u2019s shitty behavior.

I would have not stopped until he got fired, you don't get to berate people for not doing XYZ with their own fcking money.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like two things happened here.  \n\nFirst, the cashier was an AH.  these companies put pressure on their employees to try to get donations so the company looks good.  The fact the cashier\u2019s family had a personal experience probably encourages that cashier to exert a little more energy in gathering donations, but it should simply be a \u201c would you like to donate\u201d and when the customer says no, they should drop it.  This cashier chose to attack you instead.\n\nSecond, it came a a time of great stress and hit a nerve.  Sometimes when that happens, we react, which you did.  It doesn\u2019t make you an AH, it makes you human.  \n\nNow, I\u2019m thrilled you are getting back to work.  Did you file for unemployment for the time you were out of work?  If not, please do so ASAP.  Often, being out for a couple of weeks in a situation like this it will kick in.  \n\nIs there a shelter where you can get extra help?  Did you apply for SNAP?  Sometimes you can get emergency food assistance from SNAP when you are suddenly out of work like this, and will have what sounds like 5 weeks between paychecks.  \n\nIs there a LGBTQA+ shelter or support group where you are?  Sometimes they have resources or know of resources for short term assistance, especially due to you being kicked out by your parents. \n\nGood luck", "NTA - and I\u2019m sorry your parents kicked you out.

He didn't become the asshole by asking, he became the asshole when he persisted, and then passed judgement on you, not knowing your situation.", "NTA. Asking once is enough. Anything more than that is undue pressure.", "NTA \n\nThe cashier was grossly unprofessional and crossed the line by starting to pick on your appearance. It\u2019s none of his business why you don\u2019t want to donate. He shouldn\u2019t have started trying to bully/guilt you into it. \n\nYour reaction of yelling at him wasn\u2019t great, but it sounds like you are under a large amount of stress right now. I\u2019m sorry that you are going through so much. It genuinely sounds like you aren\u2019t a bad person, but just had the final straw be in the form of some nitwit cashier. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re in the states, but if you are I hope that you are able to reach out and get unemployment for the three weeks you\u2019ve been off work.

I won't let them \"round up\" to the nearest dollar anywhere after I heard the companies use customers' donations for their tax purposes.  Apparently, these companies use the total amount customers donate when they file taxes.

I'll donate directly", "[deleted]", "NTA - He was way out of line, he does not know your or anybody else's life, and has no right to try and guilt trip anyone into donating, no matter how important the cause is for him personally.\nYour screaming at him might be over the top for a normal day, but sounds to me like you were at the end of your rope already and he just gave you the final push.  You could have been more constructive, but that does not make his behavior OK!", "NTA and I would complain to head office.", "Oh, honey, NTA. I'm so sorry for what you're having to go through. \n\nYou are so strong, and you're doing such a good job, and I hope you know that. For all the hate in this world, there is so much love.

Yet he kept pressuring to the point of harassing you. **NTA**", "NTA. I really wish retailers would stop with the beggar routine at the cash register. Most don\u2019t take it to the extreme that this oblivious AH did. If I were his manager, I would fire him for harassing a customer.", "NTA at all. The cashier made a LOT of assumptions, and that's not okay. Yes, as a former cashier myself, I know that they are mandated to ask every customer, but this cashier took it way too far, even to the point of stopping your purchase midway through to berate you for wearing \"luxury\" brands? 100% is not okay. That cashier should've been fired on the spot or at the least reported to their union, regardless of the cancer situation with his brother, which I am sympathetic to.\n\nHonestly, though, the real AHs are the grocery chains who \"donate\" money to charities in this way. They take the credit for giving all this money to a good cause, making themselves look like great, stand-up companies, when it's really the customers giving more of their hard-earned money for the good of other people and grocery stores shouldn't be shaming people into donating or shaming them when they don't.", "NTA I work for a nonprofit and ask for donations from people regularly in the course of my job. I do not ever give at stores like this. That company uses your money to take tax breaks. If I am going to donate to St. Jude I'm going to do it myself directly. It's okay for the cashier to ask you once, but to push it is totally out of line.\n\nAs for your reaction, you are under extreme stress and hungry. And the cashier hit one of the things that is stressing you out at the moment. Did you overreact? Yes. Is it understandable? Also, yes.\n\nEdit: I see that I was conflating those \"portion of this sale goes to charity\" campaigns and the \"do you want to donate a dollar\" campaigns. My bad. I'll still be donating myself to smaller orgs that I have researched, but I'll be less severe about this thing. (Cashier is still totally out of line for pushing.)", "My favorite was when a store asked me to donate to the Mary Kate and Ashley Foundation.

Oh sweetie, I am SO sorry this happened to you.", "NTA. Furthermore, even if you were in a position to donate, why would you surrender the tax credit for charitable donations to a corporate entity to claim on theirs? That's just stupid.", "NTA.\n\nYou were under a lot of pressure with your current situation. You were asked. You said no. When the cashier continued to ask, they crossed a line. Evaluating your outfit for how much money you have is stupid as well. You could have bought the outfit at a thrift store. I hope your situation gets better.", "NTA. I have plenty of money but very often do not choose to donate at the register. I carefully research what I donate to. I don't know wtf Walgreens is doing with my donation before it gets to st.Jude. are there fees? Processing fees, whatever. Doesn't matter. I want every cent I give to go the organizations I choose. Not all charities are great at managing money. Not talking about St.Jude I donate them often. Many are better than others to donate to so I research and do my own gifting. This guy clearly was having a terrible day or something and it's sad he's going through what hes going through but it's not cool that he judged you. We all need to remember we have no idea what's going on in any strangers life. Be more forgiving.", "NTA. This is simple chugging...charity mugging. \n\nI donate to specific charities whose cause I believe in and say so to persistent chuggers. This guy was way out of line. Hope your situation improves very soon.", "NTA companies could donate significantly more than their customers can. And customers donating through them allows for tax write offs for the companies. I will never donate through them\n\nAnd the cashier was a dick calling you out just because he's bias. I would've gotten snappy too with him", "NTA. I would write to the head office and complain as you\u2019re probably not the only person he\u2019s pulled this on. At the very least the employee needs to be reprimanded and coached as his behaviour was out of line. You probably should have just ignored it or told him to mind his own business, as jerks like this aren\u2019t worth your energy, but I don\u2019t blame you for being upset.", "NTA. The cashiers attitude was completely uncalled for. If you choose not to donate, it's not their business, they ask once and if you say no it means NO. they don't know your background. You can be making donations otherwise. You may be short on money. It doesn't matter. You're not obligated to make donations, no matter what you're wearing. It's YOUR money and up to you what you choose to do with it. He's TA. I hope the manager teared him a new one. Sadly you didn't stay to see the result.\n\nI'm so sorry this is happening to you and that your parents kicked you out. I really hope things get better eventually, keep strong!", "NTA. I never ever donate through any big box store. These companies make millions of dollars and then donate to these charities so they can get a tax write off but the company isn't even the one donating! They ask their customers for the donations and then reap the benefits. If you want to donate, do it on your own terms.", "NTA.\n\nif you ask me, anyone paid to harass you for your time or money instantly deserves gloves off treatment after the first no.

But it's not true. Charitable donations at the register go to the charity, and the businesses do *not* take a write-off. I was wrong, as a commenter below pointed out.

The other one is The Ronald McDonald House which is charity for kids with cancer here in Australia. \n\nI granted I spend most of my time volunteering at my local animal rescue shelter because I prefer animals over people most days. And they need the extra help throughout the day. But usual when someone says no that\u2019s it.

I was confused as to why there needed to be a convo about it.\n\nI inserted my card and while I\u2019m waiting for it to process he says \u201cSo you can wear Nike but you can\u2019t donate to some kids?\u201d I swear I saw red. For context- I\u2019m gay and my parents kicked me out for it a few months ago. Stuff has been super rough and I was buying a $4 box of Ramen and dog food. My job had some pipes burst in the cold weather so I\u2019ve been out of work for 3 weeks and the nearby food pantries also have a lot of water damage so they\u2019re closed. I had $18 after rent this week (now $6). Needless to say, I\u2019m really struggling and constantly hungry.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t know that, nor did he need to. I said excuse me and he started picking apart my outfit (hat and shirt). I stood there for a second trying to figure out if he was actually serious. He stepped to the side to look over the counter and said \u201cAnd Nike shoes too.\u201d I completely lost it. I cussed him out and said he can go fuck himself and donate his whole paycheck if he cares so much. I\u2019ll admit I made a huge scene. The assistant manager came over because I was yelling and I explained the situation. The guy interrupted and told his manager that his brother had cancer and St. Jude saved him. I told him that\u2019s not a reason to berate customers and walked out before there was any resolution.\n\nCan\u2019t lie, I got on the bus and teared up because of the stress I\u2019ve been under these past few weeks. My job is opening back up on Monday but that\u2019s still 2 1/2 weeks until a paycheck. I\u2019ve been insanely hungry and even had to buy cheaper dog food (the sudden switch has messed up her stomach). I understand he\u2019s probably frustrated with people not donating, but that shouldn\u2019t give him the right to criticize people. I acted out of emotion but also feel like he shouldn\u2019t be judging people off looks. Little does he know I can\u2019t even feed myself.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
