He's a great guy ya we just didn't have much in common at all. I used to do the same thing and ask for water or a snack or something when he was right next to me or in the other room. There's no reason I couldn't have got up and got it myself. If he said no I'd get pouty and upset. He used to say he felt like a butler sometimes and that really hit me. I didn't mean to make him feel that way at all. I just wasn't happy and we never did anything together and I guess it was like a way of having some kind of control....idk..maybe like well if he does this he cares. But in reality I shouldn't have ever treated him like that. We had a mutual break up after 11 years and after dating other guys I realized I was real shitty. I let him know that I was sorry for being such a shit and we both forgave each other for not being the best. We both moved on with other people and I def wouldn't want to do that again in a relationship. I'd have a talk and make sure everything is good.", "ESH.\n\nDirectly, you two are fighting about absolutely nothing. A glass of god damn water. I'd go climb a nearby mountain and get my wife the purest damn spring water I could if she asked, because she'd rob a moving train full of bottled water all by herself if I asked her. \n\nA little deeper though, you two are clearly upset at your situation with each other and are picking fights.

I\u2019m so tired I don\u2019t want to get up.  \nYou: Okay.   Are you alright?  \nWife: Honestly, I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed.
