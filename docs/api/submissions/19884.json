We have a pretty toxic free relationship but there\u2019s quite a bit of tension when it comes to me being vegetarian. I\u2019ve been vegetarian since 11 and I have very strict morals around it. The one thing John has a problem with is me refusing to spend my money on meat. Ever since I started making my own money, I swore to myself that I would never spend a cent of it on meat. On our dates, we usually spilt the bill and sometimes he pays for it all. I told him if he orders something meat-free, I\u2019d happily pay for both of us but he never does.\n\nHis birthday was a few days ago and we went out for dinner at his favourite fancy restaurant. He got the most expensive steak they had along with a side salad and a bottle of wine. When we finished our food, I asked the waiter to spilt the bill and John looked at me shocked. He asked if I was joking and I said no. Then he told me he thought I was going to pay since it was his birthday and he didn\u2019t budget for the meal. I asked him why he thought I\u2019d pay since I\u2019ve been very clear about my rule but he couldn\u2019t give me a reason other than it being his birthday.\n\nI told him I\u2019d pay for the wine and the side salad, but he\u2019d need to pay for the steak. He was furious with me and stormed off to the bathroom. I paid for my meal, the wine and the salad and waited for him to come back. He didn\u2019t. After waiting for 20 minutes, I left.\n\nI found him sitting on a bench near where we parked the car. I asked him why he left and reminded him he needed to pay. He looked shocked when I said that and asked me if I didn\u2019t pay. I told him I\u2019d paid for everything but the meat and he lost it. He started yelling at me, telling me I was selfish, that I needed to grow up. I stayed calm and told him he needed to go back and pay. He scoffed and walked away. I ended up driving home without him.\n\nNow he\u2019s saying it\u2019s my fault that he can\u2019t show his face in his favourite restaurant since he dined and ditched. It\u2019s a pretty small restaurant so he\u2019d 100% be recognised and kicked out.\n\nSo, aita?", "created_utc": 1686994715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bmpzy/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_bfs_food_and_his/", "score": 302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ignoring the vegetarian stuff, who the fuck orders the most expensive steak possible and then expects their partner to pay for them without having checked prior. And then storming off to the bathroom expecting that to pressure you into paying for it. Op I hope you can see all the huge red flags here.", "You hold a very unusual moral position. You are deeply opposed to the consumption of meat, to the point where you will not allow your money to be spent on it. But you have no problem with a life partner who frequently eats meat in front of you, as long as you don\u2019t pay for it. This is an unusual place to draw the line. I mention it because you may wish to reconsider your position before it makes things very uncomfortable (for example, if you were to marry a meat-eater, upon marriage you\u2019d have shared income and assets. Does that mean that until marriage they can eat meat, but afterwards, they can only eat it if family money doesn\u2019t pay for it?  You\u2019re gonna be pushing your spouse to set up a lot of meat dates with friends, in that case)\u2026 \n\nBut your position is unusual, not immoral. \n\nAnyhow, you\u2019re wondering if you\u2019re an AH for what you did to John. You\u2019re not. You made your position clear, and at no point did you tell him \u201cI\u2019m taking you out to dinner\u201d (if you did, this was a big omission from your post). Because of this, it was unreasonable for him to assume that you were paying. It became even less reasonable after you asked for a split check. At that point, John left, in an effort to force you to pay even though you made your position clear. You didn\u2019t, and so he effectively stole his food. Now he\u2019s left with the consequences of those choices. \n\nWhile I find your rules odd, I don\u2019t find them confusing, and presumably neither does John. You acted in an extremely principled, predictable way. If John doesn\u2019t wish to be treated like someone who leaves restaurants without paying, perhaps he shouldn\u2019t leave restaurants without paying. I\u2019ve never read the relevant legal statutes, but I suspect there\u2019s no birthday exception. \n\nNTA", "NTA-For refusing to pay for his steak. Y T A to yourself for staying with someone who acts like this and treats you so poorly.", "I won't give you an answer because clearly this is a relationship that won't have a future.", "NTA.

Going to a fancy restaurant and ordering the most expensive steak and simply expecting their 18 SO to pay?\n\n\nI grew up middle class and as I was young, I didnt have that kind of money plus a gift.", "NTA. You've been clear on your stance from the beginning. He was just hoping the situation would be so awkward you'd cave.", "Why are you even dating him?  You should at least be honest with yourself and admit the relationship is not going to last.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t even buy the most expensive thing when my *parents* pay. The only time I got a tomahawk was when I split the entire meal with my mom and we took the leftovers home to enjoy the next day. I always asked to go to buffets for my birthday so I could pig out as much as I wanted without breaking the bank and as much as I love steak, I would never try to force my SO to go against their morals. I don\u2019t have to worry about much because I\u2019m sort of a kosher eater due to dietary issues, but if I had a vegan/vegetarian SO, I\u2019d go to a place where we could both enjoy ourselves and pay for my own stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s mind-blowing that someone would do that without even talking to their SO.", "> that I needed to grow up\n\n\nI love how this AH always telling someone to grow up, while they are the ones that stomp on boundaries, throw a tantrum and yell. And in this case, run away from paying. NTA", "NTA. Your long-standing rule has been clear and he knew it before he ordered his choice of entree.", "NTA but why are you with him? the bar is on the floor.", "NTA. Regardless of anyone's opinion on your stance it is something you've made very clear from Day 1. My guess is he thought you'd roll over given the circumstances. Sucks to be him.", "NTA. \n\nUsually yes, your partner will buy your meal for your birthday, but he was fully aware of this boundary you had and that you wouldn\u2019t buy meat. Yet he still chose to order an expensive meat meal and expected you to pay. That\u2019s his own fault. I also think it\u2019s a bit douchey to just expect someone to buy the most expensive meal on the menu that you can\u2019t even afford yourself. Especially at 18, most 18yo aren\u2019t financially stable and a expensive meal can really be a lot to spend.\n\nThe even bigger red flag is the way he acted afterwards. Throwing a fit and leaving the restaurant like that isn\u2019t ok. You shouldn\u2019t be with someone who thinks it\u2019s ok to treat you like that.", "NTA.\n\nIf he want to be able to go back to that restaurant, he can. Just go there ASAP, claim there was a misunderstanding between him and his gf concerning payment last night, and he wants to apologize and pay for the steak. Problem solved.\n\nAnd you two need to work on your communication skills. I agree with you that he shouldn't have expected you to change your moral principle on meat without asking. On the other hand, it seems you two didn't talk at all before this dinner. \n\n\"Let's go to Restaurant X on your birthday! My treat! Except meat of course, as always. You know I don't buy meat, ever. Not even on your birthday.\"\n\n...would have been a simple thing to say.", "NTA, do you really want to put up with this petty disrespectful bullshit for forever? Ditch the sulky baby.", "NTA, but I think if you're going to have this strong of a passion about it, you should probably date other vegetarians, or at least people who aren't constantly egging you on about buying meat.", "OP, I think you know what your boyfriend is doing is not ok, and I hope the comments here give you courage. The guy is a complete AH for 1) knowing your boundary and disrespecting it, 2) ordering the most expensive steak assuming you would pay for it, 3) throwing a tantrum when you called him out on his BS, and 4) leaving without paying. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Honestly expecting someone to pay for you just cause it's your birthday is immature. Nevermind your vegetarianism that he's well aware of. He needs to grow up and pay up.", "INFO: what is in the future you have a kid that's not vegetarian? Will your refuse to spend a cent rule stay in place?", "NTA\n\nAnd the reason you're not is because you already made it very clear to him (according to the post) that this is a very important value of yours. I'm vegetarian too, & I don't mind occasionally spending money on meat products for my loved ones. So I may not *personally* agree with your philosophy, but that doesn't mean I can't respect your choices. No one should have to set aside their own (harmless) personal morals, to appease someone else.\n\nI also understand your bf being upset that his bday meal wasn't paid for, but IF he truly knew your beliefs as you say, then he had no reason to expect any differently. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I expect that you probably did or gave him something else to celebrate his birthday??\n\nIf so, then it just seems like he never really accepted the fact that this is important to you, which is a whole other issue in & of itself. As for getting banned from the restaurant, absolutely NOTHING you did prevented him from paying for his meal, so that is complete BS", "NTA while the vegetarian thing is odd to me, meaning you won\u2019t pay for meat, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. You made a decision, you were clear about that decision since a child. If he feels it\u2019s weird or odd then he shouldn\u2019t be with you. You need to be with someone who respects your values. That being said, you aren\u2019t obligated to pay for anyone\u2019s birthday dinner simply because it\u2019s their birthday. Once for my birthday I picked a nice restaurant , the nicest one in town. The bill was super high, I offered to pay for half of our dinner since I knew the cost was above what my SO at the time would be comfortable paying. He seemed relieved and I even offered to cover the whole thing and he was fine with half. Point is his argument is invalid . You don\u2019t pay for meat. Period.", "NTA\n\nIts weird in general to buy the most expencive thing you can and just assume someone else would pay, without having a chat about it. Even on their birthday. To then throw a fit, lie about going to the bathroom and just leave to pressure you to pay anyway, and then blame you for not being able to go back there? AH behaviour.\n\nAdd on top that you have never payed for any meat dish, and have been very clear that you will never do so, him making such a big assumption without talking to you about it is even worse. \n\nHe knew your stance, didnt talk to you about it, and was so confident that he could get you to drop your morals and pay, that he went in there knowing full well that he couldnt pay for it. When you didnt behave he threw a full on tantrum, and blamed it on you. Be carefull with this one.", "ESH. This was a predictable problem because it is the norm to pay for someone\u2019s meal on their birthday. \n\nI admire your position and desire to hold true to your principles. But didn\u2019t it occur to you before you went out that he might expect you to pay? If your principles are so strong, why date a guy who eats meat when you know there will be occasions in life when you pay for the food? Does he dictate what you can eat when he pays? If not, then this situation must seem unfair to him.\n\nHe\u2019s the AH for obvious reasons", "NTA - it's not like this was a surprise, you've been consistent.. now he knows it goes even deeper than he might have realized.", "ESH\n\nyou should break up", "ESH\n\nyou both sound obnoxious.", "NTA, I feel like he was possibly trying to set a precedent - so the next time you can't say no.\n\nI did see someone mentioning a voucher, that may be a good idea for future birthdays.", "NTA. I\u2019m not a vegetarian but if he knew meaning you\u2019ve told him you won\u2019t pay for meat then he shouldn\u2019t have expected you to pay for it. BTW did he go back and pay for his steak? Oh btw this is a sign you two are not compatible", "NTA its a boundary you've made clear, he shat all over it and then got annoyed when you wouldn't clean the shit up.", "NTA, you have your morals and you\u2019ve drawn your lines which you have clearly expressed to him previously, birthday or not. But fwiw I actually think the bigger issue here is they he purposely snuck out of the restaurant in a further attempt to force you into paying the bill. The whole vegetarian/meat thing aside, this is a massive, massive red flag. Controlling, manipulative and bullying tendencies shown right there that will escalate over time. I promise you this will not be a first and last type situation.", "NTA *but* \n\nI think you guys should have had the conversation beforehand. It\u2019s not completely unreasonable to expect that if you\u2019re going out for dinner on your birthday, your partner is picking up the tab, particularly if the partner picks up the tab for you on special occasions. I think he probably should have asked what the plan was and even if you were paying, HUGE AH move to pick the most expensive thing on the menu, but I also think you could have said \u201cI know it\u2019s your birthday and I\u2019d love to treat you, but I want to reiterate that I\u2019m not comfortable paying for meat. Is it okay if I buy your drinks and a dessert instead?\u201d \n\nOr as others have stated, getting a gift card to the restaurant beforehand. You\u2019re still only 18 so I don\u2019t think the expectation *should* be that you necessarily pick up the tab on celebratory occasions, but just advice for moving forward. This won\u2019t be the last time you take a meat-eating friend out for their birthday or a promotion or something like that, and I would have some ideas in mind about how to approach it.", "Im not sure about this. On the one hand, you don't have to associate with meat. \n\nOn the other hand, he has paid for many of your meals and you havent paid for a single one.\n\nI really feel like if you are going to be this specific on what you want to pay for, then you should always split the bill", "NTA. You have a boundary, which he can choose to agree with or not, and you made it very clear multiple times now. He chose to not listen and think that you should break that rule because it's his birthday, which is silly. Tell him next time it's your birthday, you'll have him do something he finds morally wrong, and see how he reacts. Better yet just find someone more supportive.", "Info: did you get approval from the restaurant staff to only pay part of the bill before you left?", "ESH, since it\u2019s his favourite you could have brought a voucher to the restaurant for him to use on whatever he wants without the guilt associated with it. He knew it was your rule from the beginning and he should have taken that into account when ordering, it\u2019s not like he was blindsided", "ESH\nFrankly I think you are worse though.  Get over yourself.  The world does not revolve around your dietary preferences.  If you take someone out for their birthday it\u2019s for them and not you.  \n\nIncorrigible.", "I am going to be downvoted going against the grain but yes YTA. You took your partner out to a restaurant for their birthday - that's a celebration, and 99/100 times a gift. You should have made it clear that his birthday is no exception to the rule. Then he got upset and walked away, and instead of being empathetic or even paying upfront so he could pay you back, you just left without paying at all and told your upset bf to go back in there and pay for his steak. Ouch.\n\nEdit after rereading: I should have said ESH since he screamed at you. You two better break up.", "NTA, but this relationship does t sound toxic free. Quite the opposite actually.", "ESH. \n\nYou, for forcing your believes onto other people.

That\u2019s messed up. \n\nHim, for ordering the most expensive steak without making sure it was okay and for running away. \n\nYou both need to split up. You need to date someone who is also vegetarian. What happens if you get married? Your partner would never again be allowed to eat anything with meat in it? That\u2019s very unfair", "ESH\n\nYou have your strict morals on spending a cent on meat, you have your rights to do what you want with your money. No one can fault that for what it is. He needs to grow up and handle things better, like seriously. What even was that reaction on his part? \n\nHowever you should also grow up. Better communication needs to be had all around, absolutely. You need to learn to bend a bit. There will be a situation again in the future where making the \"spending a cent\" rule will need bent. You definitely arent at fault for how he acted, but it is your fault for not realizing that you have adopted a ruleset that will be incompatible with meat eaters. And if you have kids and they eat meat and you still don't spend a cent? It's a hard line philosophy that will cause issues. Take this as a lesson and either date someone with your morals or learn to be less hardlined.\n\n\nFor those who might think I'm biased, my last boyfriend of 3ish years was vegetarian and prior to him, I was vegetarian for nearly 4, voluntarily. While I was with him I ate meat often. Didn't cause a fuss even a single time.", "ESH\n\nHe should've discussed it with you beforehand as this has been an ongoing situation. However many spouse's do like to go outside of their comfort zone in order to treat their partner. He is happy to often pick up the bill for the pair of you, yet you wouldn't do it for his birthday? Did you get him a birthday present? Money isn't mentioned as being the issue here so I could understand it if he ordered something way out of your price range but this should have been talked about first. \n\nIt just sounds like you're trying to guilt him into being a vegetarian and it's causing strain within your relationship.", "YTA for not communicating this before. You do realize that server probably had to pay for his dinner?  Not to mention they missed out on a tip. Someone needs to make this right. You care more about cows than people?", "I feel like it is socially expected to pay for your partners meal on their birthday day, that is at least my experience in life. I want to start by saying I dont think you have to break or change your morals for someone.  I was a vegetarian, myself, for a few years and i am no longer one.  If you dont want to eat meat or support the conpanies that keep animals in disgusting conditions and  then slaughter them.  I understand and support your ideals. I don't think he may have reacted well to another reminder/conversation about your ideals but it is likely that it would've help reaffirm expectations within a relationship.  Maybe he thought you'd make an exception for \"his special day.\" I don't know.\nYou haven't been together long and he may not have known how adherent you are to your rule.  \nI think he is the biggest AH in the situation for how he handled it storming off and yelling.  He should of listened to you when you were telling him your rule on meat. \nI also think maybe it could've been communicated once more to manage expectations, mostly because of the social expectations of partners paying for one another's meal on their respective birthday.\n\nTLDR NTA", "ESH.  You both suck big time for screwing a restaurant over because you cannot communicate.  He was being a baby, totally, but you could have paid the bill and had him pay you back.

Hate to play this card but what sort of dude insists someone else(and no offense, an 18 year old) pays for him?  He should be glad you even went to a steak house with him.

You're taking someone out and paying for everything but meat is stupid. You not paying for meat but everything else is not gonna have any positive effect when you go out with someone. \n\nI grew up in a strict vegetarian family but I'm not, and what I've noticed is that it's harder to sit next to someone who is eating meat than to spend money on it. My mom and sister can't bear to sit next me when I eat meat so I usually don't when I'm with them. But that doesn't mean they don't pay for my food. You've got a highly unusual and weird moral compass.

We have a pretty toxic free relationship but there\u2019s quite a bit of tension when it comes to me being vegetarian. I\u2019ve been vegetarian since 11 and I have very strict morals around it. The one thing John has a problem with is me refusing to spend my money on meat. Ever since I started making my own money, I swore to myself that I would never spend a cent of it on meat. On our dates, we usually spilt the bill and sometimes he pays for it all. I told him if he orders something meat-free, I\u2019d happily pay for both of us but he never does.\n\nHis birthday was a few days ago and we went out for dinner at his favourite fancy restaurant. He got the most expensive steak they had along with a side salad and a bottle of wine. When we finished our food, I asked the waiter to spilt the bill and John looked at me shocked. He asked if I was joking and I said no. Then he told me he thought I was going to pay since it was his birthday and he didn\u2019t budget for the meal.

He was furious with me and stormed off to the bathroom. I paid for my meal, the wine and the salad and waited for him to come back. He didn\u2019t. After waiting for 20 minutes, I left.\n\nI found him sitting on a bench near where we parked the car. I asked him why he left and reminded him he needed to pay. He looked shocked when I said that and asked me if I didn\u2019t pay. I told him I\u2019d paid for everything but the meat and he lost it. He started yelling at me, telling me I was selfish, that I needed to grow up. I stayed calm and told him he needed to go back and pay. He scoffed and walked away. I ended up driving home without him.\n\nNow he\u2019s saying it\u2019s my fault that he can\u2019t show his face in his favourite restaurant since he dined and ditched.
