We have a pretty toxic free relationship but there\u2019s quite a bit of tension when it comes to me being vegetarian. I\u2019ve been vegetarian since 11 and I have very strict morals around it. The one thing John has a problem with is me refusing to spend my money on meat. Ever since I started making my own money, I swore to myself that I would never spend a cent of it on meat. On our dates, we usually spilt the bill and sometimes he pays for it all. I told him if he orders something meat-free, I\u2019d happily pay for both of us but he never does. When he pays for my food, it\u2019s when I\u2019ve spend money on the activity. Normally concerts and festivals. That\u2019s me paying \u20ac120+ on tickets and him spending maybe \u20ac50 on food\n\nHis birthday was a few days ago and we went out for dinner at his favourite fancy restaurant. He got the most expensive steak they had along with a side salad and a bottle of wine. When we finished our food, I asked the waiter to spilt the bill and John looked at me shocked. He asked if I was joking and I said no. Then he told me he thought I was going to pay since it was his birthday and he didn\u2019t budget for the meal. I asked him why he thought I\u2019d pay since I\u2019ve been very clear about my rule but he couldn\u2019t give me a reason other than it being his birthday.\n\nI told him I\u2019d pay for the wine and the side salad, but he\u2019d need to pay for the steak. He was furious with me and stormed off to the bathroom. I paid for my meal, the wine and the salad and waited for him to come back. He didn\u2019t. After waiting for 20 minutes, I left.\n\nI found him sitting on a bench near where we parked the car. I asked him why he left and reminded him he needed to pay. He looked shocked when I said that and asked me if I didn\u2019t pay. I told him I\u2019d paid for everything but the meat and he lost it. He started yelling at me, telling me I was selfish, that I needed to grow up. I stayed calm and told him he needed to go back and pay. He scoffed and walked away. I ended up driving home without him.\n\nNow he\u2019s saying it\u2019s my fault that he can\u2019t show his face in his favourite restaurant since he dined and ditched. It\u2019s a pretty small restaurant so he\u2019d 100% be recognised and kicked out.\n\nSo, aita?\n\nEDIT: To the people commenting about me not \u201ctreating\u201d him on his birthday, yes, I did. I even dipped into my savings for his present.\n\nEDIT 2: I did not \u201ctake him out\u201d for dinner. He was the one that suggested it.", "created_utc": 1686994715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bmpzy/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_bfs_food_and_his/", "score": 18974, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ignoring the vegetarian stuff, who the fuck orders the most expensive steak possible and then expects their partner to pay for them without having checked prior. And then storming off to the bathroom expecting that to pressure you into paying for it. Op I hope you can see all the huge red flags here.", "You hold a very unusual moral position. You are deeply opposed to the consumption of meat, to the point where you will not allow your money to be spent on it. But you have no problem with a life partner who frequently eats meat in front of you, as long as you don\u2019t pay for it. This is an unusual place to draw the line. I mention it because you may wish to reconsider your position before it makes things very uncomfortable (for example, if you were to marry a meat-eater, upon marriage you\u2019d have shared income and assets. Does that mean that until marriage they can eat meat, but afterwards, they can only eat it if family money doesn\u2019t pay for it?  You\u2019re gonna be pushing your spouse to set up a lot of meat dates with friends, in that case)\u2026 \n\nBut your position is unusual, not immoral. \n\nAnyhow, you\u2019re wondering if you\u2019re an AH for what you did to John. You\u2019re not. You made your position clear, and at no point did you tell him \u201cI\u2019m taking you out to dinner\u201d (if you did, this was a big omission from your post). Because of this, it was unreasonable for him to assume that you were paying. It became even less reasonable after you asked for a split check. At that point, John left, in an effort to force you to pay even though you made your position clear. You didn\u2019t, and so he effectively stole his food. Now he\u2019s left with the consequences of those choices. \n\nWhile I find your rules odd, I don\u2019t find them confusing, and presumably neither does John. You acted in an extremely principled, predictable way. If John doesn\u2019t wish to be treated like someone who leaves restaurants without paying, perhaps he shouldn\u2019t leave restaurants without paying. I\u2019ve never read the relevant legal statutes, but I suspect there\u2019s no birthday exception. \n\nNTA", "NTA-For refusing to pay for his steak.

You should at least be honest with yourself and admit the relationship is not going to last.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t even buy the most expensive thing when my *parents* pay. The only time I got a tomahawk was when I split the entire meal with my mom and we took the leftovers home to enjoy the next day. I always asked to go to buffets for my birthday so I could pig out as much as I wanted without breaking the bank and as much as I love steak, I would never try to force my SO to go against their morals. I don\u2019t have to worry about much because I\u2019m sort of a kosher eater due to dietary issues, but if I had a vegan/vegetarian SO, I\u2019d go to a place where we could both enjoy ourselves and pay for my own stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s mind-blowing that someone would do that without even talking to their SO.", "> that I needed to grow up\n\n\nI love how those AH always telling someone to grow up, while they are the ones that stomp on boundaries, throw a tantrum and yell.

Sucks to be him.", "NTA. \n\nUsually yes, your partner will buy your meal for your birthday, but he was fully aware of this boundary you had and that you wouldn\u2019t buy meat. Yet he still chose to order an expensive meat meal and expected you to pay. That\u2019s his own fault. I also think it\u2019s a bit douchey to just expect someone to buy the most expensive meal on the menu that you can\u2019t even afford yourself. Especially at 18, most 18yo aren\u2019t financially stable and a expensive meal can really be a lot to spend.\n\nThe even bigger red flag is the way he acted afterwards.

You shouldn\u2019t be with someone who thinks it\u2019s ok to treat you like that.", "NTA.\n\nIf he want to be able to go back to that restaurant, he can. Just go there ASAP, claim there was a misunderstanding between him and his gf concerning payment last night, and he wants to apologize and pay for the steak. Problem solved.\n\nAnd you two need to work on your communication skills. I agree with you that he shouldn't have expected you to change your moral principle on meat without asking. On the other hand, it seems you two didn't talk at all before this dinner. \n\n\"Let's go to Restaurant X on your birthday! My treat! Except meat of course, as always. You know I don't buy meat, ever. Not even on your birthday.\"\n\n...would have been a simple thing to say.", "NTA, do you really want to put up with this petty disrespectful bullshit for forever? Ditch the sulky baby.", "NTA, but I think if you're going to have this strong of a passion about it, you should probably date other vegetarians, or at least people who aren't constantly egging you on about buying meat.", "OP, I think you know what your boyfriend is doing is not ok, and I hope the comments here give you courage. The guy is a complete AH for 1) knowing your boundary and disrespecting it, 2) ordering the most expensive steak assuming you would pay for it, 3) throwing a tantrum when you called him out on his BS, and 4) leaving without paying. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Honestly expecting someone to pay for you just cause it's your birthday is immature. Nevermind your vegetarianism that he's well aware of. He needs to grow up and pay up.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nAnd the reason you're not is because you already made it very clear to him (according to the post) that this is a very important value of yours. I'm vegetarian too, & I don't mind occasionally spending money on meat products for my loved ones. So I may not *personally* agree with your philosophy, but that doesn't mean I can't respect your choices. No one should have to set aside their own (harmless) personal morals, to appease someone else.\n\nI also understand your bf being upset that his bday meal wasn't paid for, but IF he truly knew your beliefs as you say, then he had no reason to expect any differently. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I expect that you probably did or gave him something else to celebrate his birthday??\n\nIf so, then it just seems like he never really accepted the fact that this is important to you, which is a whole other issue in & of itself. As for getting banned from the restaurant, absolutely NOTHING you did prevented him from paying for his meal, so that is complete BS", "NTA while the vegetarian thing is odd to me, meaning you won\u2019t pay for meat, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. You made a decision, you were clear about that decision since a child. If he feels it\u2019s weird or odd then he shouldn\u2019t be with you. You need to be with someone who respects your values. That being said, you aren\u2019t obligated to pay for anyone\u2019s birthday dinner simply because it\u2019s their birthday. Once for my birthday I picked a nice restaurant , the nicest one in town. The bill was super high, I offered to pay for half of our dinner since I knew the cost was above what my SO at the time would be comfortable paying. He seemed relieved and I even offered to cover the whole thing and he was fine with half. Point is his argument is invalid . You don\u2019t pay for meat. Period.", "NTA\n\nIts weird in general to buy the most expencive thing you can and just assume someone else would pay, without having a chat about it. Even on their birthday. To then throw a fit, lie about going to the bathroom and just leave to pressure you to pay anyway, and then blame you for not being able to go back there? AH behaviour.\n\nAdd on top that you have never payed for any meat dish, and have been very clear that you will never do so, him making such a big assumption without talking to you about it is even worse. \n\nHe knew your stance, didnt talk to you about it, and was so confident that he could get you to drop your morals and pay, that he went in there knowing full well that he couldnt pay for it. When you didnt behave he threw a full on tantrum, and blamed it on you. Be carefull with this one.", "ESH. This was a predictable problem because it is the norm to pay for someone\u2019s meal on their birthday. \n\nI admire your position and desire to hold true to your principles. But didn\u2019t it occur to you before you went out that he might expect you to pay? If your principles are so strong, why date a guy who eats meat when you know there will be occasions in life when you pay for the food? Does he dictate what you can eat when he pays? If not, then this situation must seem unfair to him.\n\nHe\u2019s the AH for obvious reasons", "NTA - it's not like this was a surprise, you've been consistent.. now he knows it goes even deeper than he might have realized.", "ESH\n\nyou should break up", "ESH\n\nyou both sound obnoxious.", "NTA, I feel like he was possibly trying to set a precedent - so the next time you can't say no.\n\nI did see someone mentioning a voucher, that may be a good idea for future birthdays.", "NTA. I\u2019m not a vegetarian but if he knew meaning you\u2019ve told him you won\u2019t pay for meat then he shouldn\u2019t have expected you to pay for it. BTW did he go back and pay for his steak? Oh btw this is a sign you two are not compatible", "NTA its a boundary you've made clear, he shat all over it and then got annoyed when you wouldn't clean the shit up.", "NTA, you have your morals and you\u2019ve drawn your lines which you have clearly expressed to him previously, birthday or not. But fwiw I actually think the bigger issue here is they he purposely snuck out of the restaurant in a further attempt to force you into paying the bill. The whole vegetarian/meat thing aside, this is a massive, massive red flag. Controlling, manipulative and bullying tendencies shown right there that will escalate over time. I promise you this will not be a first and last type situation.", "NTA *but* \n\nI think you guys should have had the conversation beforehand. It\u2019s not completely unreasonable to expect that if you\u2019re going out for dinner on your birthday, your partner is picking up the tab, particularly if the partner picks up the tab for you on special occasions. I think he probably should have asked what the plan was and even if you were paying, HUGE AH move to pick the most expensive thing on the menu, but I also think you could have said \u201cI know it\u2019s your birthday and I\u2019d love to treat you, but I want to reiterate that I\u2019m not comfortable paying for meat. Is it okay if I buy your drinks and a dessert instead?\u201d \n\nOr as others have stated, getting a gift card to the restaurant beforehand. You\u2019re still only 18 so I don\u2019t think the expectation *should* be that you necessarily pick up the tab on celebratory occasions, but just advice for moving forward.

You have a boundary, which he can choose to agree with or not, and you made it very clear multiple times now.

You took your partner out to a restaurant for their birthday - that's a celebration, and 99/100 times a gift. You should have made it clear that his birthday is no exception to the rule. Then he got upset and walked away, and instead of being empathetic or even paying upfront so he could pay you back, you just left without paying at all and told your upset bf to go back in there and pay for his steak.

He needs to grow up and handle things better, like seriously. What even was that reaction on his part? \n\nHowever you should also grow up. Better communication needs to be had all around, absolutely. You need to learn to bend a bit. There will be a situation again in the future where making the \"spending a cent\" rule will need bent. You definitely arent at fault for how he acted, but it is your fault for not realizing that you have adopted a ruleset that will be incompatible with meat eaters. And if you have kids and they eat meat and you still don't spend a cent? It's a hard line philosophy that will cause issues. Take this as a lesson and either date someone with your morals or learn to be less hardlined.\n\n\nFor those who might think I'm biased, my last boyfriend of 3ish years was vegetarian and prior to him, I was vegetarian for nearly 4, voluntarily. While I was with him I ate meat often. Didn't cause a fuss even a single time.", "ESH\n\nHe should've discussed it with you beforehand as this has been an ongoing situation.

Did you get him a birthday present? Money isn't mentioned as being the issue here so I could understand it if he ordered something way out of your price range but this should have been talked about first. \n\nIt just sounds like you're trying to guilt him into being a vegetarian and it's causing strain within your relationship.", "YTA for not communicating this before. You do realize that server probably had to pay for his dinner?  Not to mention they missed out on a tip. Someone needs to make this right.

If you dont want to eat meat or support the conpanies that keep animals in disgusting conditions and  then slaughter them.  I understand and support your ideals.

You not paying for meat but everything else is not gonna have any positive effect when you go out with someone. \n\nI grew up in a strict vegetarian family but I'm not, and what I've noticed is that it's harder to sit next to someone who is eating meat than to spend money on it.

I told him if he orders something meat-free, I\u2019d happily pay for both of us but he never does.\n\nHis birthday was a few days ago and we went out for dinner at his favourite fancy restaurant. He got the most expensive steak they had along with a side salad and a bottle of wine. When we finished our food, I asked the waiter to spilt the bill and John looked at me shocked.

He was furious with me and stormed off to the bathroom. I paid for my meal, the wine and the salad and waited for him to come back. He didn\u2019t. After waiting for 20 minutes, I left.\n\nI found him sitting on a bench near where we parked the car. I asked him why he left and reminded him he needed to pay. He looked shocked when I said that and asked me if I didn\u2019t pay. I told him I\u2019d paid for everything but the meat and he lost it. He started yelling at me, telling me I was selfish, that I needed to grow up. I stayed calm and told him he needed to go back and pay. He scoffed and walked away. I ended up driving home without him.\n\nNow he\u2019s saying it\u2019s my fault that he can\u2019t show his face in his favourite restaurant since he dined and ditched.

TL; DR what if your roles were reversed? Boyfriend is TA for picking biggest steak. *He probably thinks* YTA for showing him he matters less to you than your preference not to pay for meat.\n\n_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n\nI am not that person and I dont want to debate morals either.  I am not vegetarian nor anti-vegetarian.  To each their own.  This is not to argue with you but just as food for thought.\n\nMany times in ethical questions, it helps to flip-flop the positions to see if people would have the same stance.\n\nImagine your bf was into the paleo diet.  After reading up on the matter, he came to the conclusion that humans should eat, predominantly, meats (especially organ meat), nuts, and berries like our hunter-gatherer ancestors, for better nutrition purposes.  However by extension he took a moral position against moderm agricultural processes and products, so disagreed with farm products such as corn, wheat, anything with preservatives, or plants used in salads.\n\nYou find this thinking unusual but, whatever, so long as he keeps it to himself.  You just deal with each other having different grocery lists and usually shop together.\n\nYou call him while he is at the grocery store and ask him to buy you some baby spinach and a box of Frosted Flakes.  He  refuses.  He tells you that he disagrees with consuming those things and refuses to spend any money on it.  If you want them you need to get in the car and go get them yourself.  You argue some and he says \"you know my position on this\" and hangs up.\n\nUntil now it has not caused an issue but you find his atance perturbing.  It doesnt seem like a big deal for him to buy those things for you to save the trip.  It seems like a huge hassle to have to get dressed, get in the car, and drive all the way there just to get two items.\n\nThe issue that arises here is when one person makes a personal moral choice vs. requiring others to conform to that choice.  Some moral choices are universal and apply across all of a society (dont murder or steal) that get made into laws, and others are within people's personal territory to decide (whether premarital sex is allowed or legal, or whether they choose to celebrate Halloween.  A tourist may refuse to attend a country's patriotic parade because it isnt their country).  \n\nAn example: My sister had an ED and decided she didnt like soda because it was pure sugar that would make her fat (her words, not mine).  She came to this conclusion on her own in high school after a typical childhood of drinking tons of soda, like the rest of us did.  As an adult, she refuses to let any of her family, including children, have or consume soda at home or anywhere.  Guess how her family feels about that.  Her kids drink it in secret like its a sin they should feel shame for.\n\nShe and your boyfriend at the grocery store are both forcing others to abide by a personal moral stance and not a universal moral.  *I* dont like houses painted bright colors because I find it garish and tacky, so *you* cant do it.  *I* disagree with riding horses so I refuse to pay for *you* to do it for your birthday present.\n\nIt is the opposite of \"live and let live\".\n\nYour bf is TA for picking the most expensive steak.\n\nAgain, just a thought.  Going along with that, you might want to think how your stance on meat will go over time.  If you decide to abide by this the rest of your life then you will face situations in the future, like going out on a double date dinner with another married couple and refusing to be willing to treat them even if they treated you before.  You face telling your children (or nieces) that they are not allowed to order Chicken McNuggets when you take them to McDonalds.  Likewise, when your parents can no longer drive and you offer to order them some Chinese takeout or pizza.  These are realistic situations you will likely face, or something like them.  Now imagine what their opinion of you will be.  Will abiding by that rule matter more?\n\nI humbly suggest thinking about whether you intend to hold tight to your opinion about never spending money on meat for the rest of your life.  If you decide to, that's fine.  If you decide not to, that's fine.  If you do, some people will feel that stance matters more to you than they do, and they will be right.\n\nYour bf has just become the first of them and is sore about it.  He might think YTA for holding that opinion as a higher priority than your relationship with him.  It may break the relationship for him.\n\nI know my flip-flop analogy isnt a great one but the idea of switching roles to see if your opinion is the same can be a helpful approach.\n\nThese are just thoughts. I dont care if you pay for meat or not.", "Right?! Like, if you order a steak (and bottle of wine) that you yourself have to budget for, then what in the heck are you doing assuming your partner didn't need to budget as well?\n\nEdit: autocorrect did me dirty.", "I think the money isn't really the issue here, if he would've ordered the most expensive vegan food she may have paid for it idk.

You should consider being with somebody that shares in them.\n\nAlso, what's the big deal paying for a steak?  The cow is already dead weather you pay for it or not.  You haven't accomplished anything but showing off the moral high horse you are riding.", "ESH.\n\nThere's a lot to take in.. I hope I can word out all my thoughts properly for this one.\n\nFor starters.. you're allowed to have whatever boundaries you have and, sure, whenever you choose to uphold them. That's your right, all the power to you. If you don't want to invest any money into the meat industry, that's your choice. Make note though that the strength (and inflexibility - which is fine, your choice) of this boundary can make things quite problematic for you in the future.\n\nYou'll have to be strictly with partners where their morals completely match with your own or there will always be issues that will come up. Relationships involve more than one individual and everyone is different. Communication is important. And sometimes there might be occasions where compromise is needed.. not saying you have to compromise when it comes to this boundary though.. just the inability to compromise will be a relationship-ender on every occasion. Plus another line is \"picking and choosing your battles\". Which you're allowed to stand firm on your side of things.. but if it's a battle you'll engage in each and every time then, again, relationships will come to an end.\n\nMuch like this relationship needs to end.. for a multitude of reasons. Incompatibility and lack of proper communication are the biggest factors.\n\nWhen it comes to his birthday.. it's not unreasonable that he expected you to treat him. It's a pretty common thing (in North America at least).. however he shouldn't have *expected* it though, go ill-equipped (if he did?), sure went for something extremely expensive and put you on the spot that way - especially knowing your boundary and rule. THEN bolted to not pay the steak.. either due to not having money on him or as a way to pressure you. Either way he was an AH for all that and especially for yelling at you afterwards.\n\nMy question is though.. why didn't you, at any point, intervene and allowed things to unfold as they did? Was it a steakhouse? Or any average restaurant? Because if it was a steakhouse.. you could've prevented the situation by saying no before going in.\n\nNext part to this is.. were you present when he made his order? Or did you go to the bathroom? If you were there and heard him made the order.. that was the moment you should've *immediately* reminded him of your stance and that it doesn't change, no matter the occasion. So that way this could've been prevented. Unless you did bring it up and he did what he did anyway.. then you're no longer at fault in this, it's all on him.\n\nEither way so much could've been done to deal with this situation.. or to prevent it. But what's done is done, unfortunately. I feel for the restaurant the most though. That bill should be payed.. but one of you needs to set aside your egos and step up. Technically it should be your boyfriend. But other people, like restaurants in this case, shouldn't be victims of ego battles between you both. So please take this into consideration if you both choose to remain in this relationship together.\n\nOP.. bear in mind what issues will come for you when it comes to relationships with this. People should respect your decision on this moral stance. However.. respect goes both ways. As I mentioned.. you can unfortunately only maintain stable relationships with people who completely match you due to the rigidity of your boundary. And you might not encounter a lot of like-minded people.\n\nPlus if you choose to have pets or children.. you'll have to force yourself to compromise in those situations because you're obligated to feed pets (if they're carnivores it's problematic) and your children if they want to eat meat.\n\nIt's fine for *you*.. but you can't push this onto others. People here are saying you aren't forcing your morals onto others but, unfortunately, you are. To some extent, anyway. If you weren't then your boundary wouldn't have an effect on others.. but it does. It creates issues in relationships. But that's something you'll have to deal with, not anyone else.\n\nSo this is why I said ESH.

And so many cool guys with smoker setups.", "It\u2019s called selection bias; survivorship bias is a form of it.", "I\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t assholes everywhere but I have definitely met more meat eaters who hassle veggies than vice versa. Thankfully it\u2019s a small percentage on both sides tho.", "It\u2019s impossible for both sides of anything to not have assholes to some degree, because humans gonna human, but the amount of meat eaters that attempt to sneak animal products in vegan food vs. vegans trying to sneak veggies instead of meat is absolutely disproportionate. Most vegans or vegetarians I know don\u2019t hold back verbally, but they\u2019re also aware that they aren\u2019t going to convert anyone to their cause by sneaking them \u201cimpossible\u201d burgers. And meat eaters do it exclusively because they want to hurt the other possible, not because they think their cause is worthy.\n\nDo you know any meat eaters that actually advocate for animal cruelty?

In other words, you weren't born to support their asses  because they couldn't.  You get no brownie points for supporting unsupportive parents who actually added mental and physical stress to your life as a young person and possibly undermined you being able to achieve more had they not taken from you while you were young.", "Yeah in general I'd probably agree. The in your face carnivores are definitely more prominent.\n\nI had prospective date once in highschool tell me my sister was dumb for choosing to be vegetarian, and \"likely has a really low IQ\"\n\nWe didn't go on a second date.\n\nBut man oh man the number of antivegan comments I heard from upper middle class white dudes when I worked at Starbucks. Mocking people for choosing a dairy alternative...", "Vegans may talk about it more but meat eaters seem to actually try to push their eating habits on others more.

THEY are not immature, HE'S the only who's immature and selfish. She was respectful and mature throughout.", "I was working part time at Sears, in the headlines stock room, at the time. The loss prevention manager would run across to Mikey D\u2019s and buy like a sack of 50 to keep us from leaving for lunch on Saturdays during the summer. We ate them, but of course we all still left for our breaks lol", "People get weird when it comes to food. My wife has Celiac, and kept getting pressured into eating things that were not safely prepared for her. She\u2019d ask people to not make food for her, but they\u2019d do it anyway and guilt her into eating it. She is hypersensitive to cross contamination, likely due to how long it took to get a diagnosis.\n\nI gave up gluten early in our relationship after we kissed too soon after I had eaten some bread and she got violently ill.

I missed that. \n\nWhat kind of a person TELLS another to go somewhere, orders something expensive, and expects the other to pay for it? The nerve of that boy...", "Yeah, as much as I think op is drawing a stupid line, it\u2019s their line to draw for their life. So I quickly got past that and arrived here", "look at it this way; if you had a birthday party at home, would you pay for all the food and drinks? or would you expect your guests to pay for it? lol", "Exactly. And its like dominoes, when one boundary is taken down, its open season on the rest of them. And in the future of she has the need to set another serious boundary, he won't take it seriously at all.", "> Precisely.

He\u2019s newly 20. They could be 13 months apart for all we know lmao", "Normal to pay? Really? In some nations it is the birthday person that pays for the guests... It's a dick move to take this for guaranteed and order the most expansive stuff...", "It\u2019s not incompatibility, it\u2019s that he\u2019s an awful person. \u201cOh, I just assumed you were paying, so I ordered the most expensive steak and wine on the menu.\u201d What an insufferable asshole.", "Yep, and by the \u201clogic\u201d once he\u2019s tricked her into paying for meat now she\u2019s done it before and he can convince her to do it again. He sucks.", "I was 18 in 1998 and could barely scrape by. Getting fried tofu at a Chinese restaurant was something I treated myself to once a month. Other than that, it was college cafeteria food. I can't imagine going to an actual restaurant if I were 18 today.", "When my husband and I met in the 90\u2019s, the very few times we splurged on a restaurant meal, we usually split it. The cost.

Never compromise your happiness for another\u2019s misery.. I\u2019d say break up, and enjoy the memories you\u2019ve made.. move on, and let that relationship be a life lesson- be with somebody more compatible, and respectable, of your beliefs/ideologies/lifestyles.", "Mac n cheese, and splurging was the occasional tri tip", "Even at 25 all we could afford as newlyweds was $25 for going out for Everything!\n\nIt was always a choice between food or cheap entertainment.", "My thoughts exactly lmao. I'm in my 30's also. I can budget for a nicer dinner if needed, but at 18, no way. Food costs were definitely lower then, but not knowing how to convert it, I think it's only off some cents per dollar if I remember correctly, back then it would still be $50+ for a higher end steak, now $75+!", "It's what it's called here in the UK.", "She communicated very clearly, he didn't and even ends up blaming her for the consequences of his own actions. He didn't go back to pay, is his own fault he can't go to that restaurant anymore.", "also 29: why on earth would I drop so much money on a fancy meat??? overpriced restaurants are just an insane concept to me", "Proper way without getting punished for doing right is to go and scan enough items in the self check out to cover the bill,  pay the tab, then go through the store and put everything back on the shelves", "> You don't see that often on reddit.\n\nNobody is going to make a post to say that everything is going fine.", "The fuck? What kind of people feel the need to trick others into eating meat?\n\nI eat meat, but I have a solid repertoire of decent vegan/vegetarian dishes that I can cook for people (and myself of course) when needed. Relying on meat for most meals is unnecessary.", "I went to a BBQ with my husband once where his friends wife who is vegan gave me a vegan burger patty as a way to prove I wouldn\u2019t know the difference, only problem was they contained gluten and I\u2019m coeliac so 30 mins later I\u2019m violently sick for hours, her husband is saying sorry he must of caused cross contamination somehow, it took her days to finally text me and admit what she had done.", "Narrator: He was not an otherwise \"great guy.\"", "ThatVeganTeacher: \"allow me to introduce myself\"", "and nobody got banned from a restaurant.\n\nI'd just go back and ask to see a manager/owner. \n\n\"Hey, there was a miscommunication about the bill between my partner and I, I found out later it wasn't fully picked up, I love this place and it's one of my favorite restaurants. I'm here to make it right because I feel bad about it\".\n\nMost decent restaurants will probably laugh and say \"Yeah, that's fine. It happens and we appreciate you coming back. Hell, it's on the house and hope you had a happy birthday. Hope to see you again soon.\"\n\nBut that requires you to be an adult. Cause any place who wants loyal customers wouldn't ban you for that if you come in to fix it.\n\nBut they both are clearly not adults.", "Probably someone who\u2019s only 1 year away from being a teenager themselves.", "This! At 18 years old in the 90s, I could sort of scrape together just enough money to rent a 1 bedroom for myself, working my entry level job. Good luck now, that ship is long sailed!", "hell, I'm almost 20 and I make $14.50 an hour (a lot of money in my area) and there's no way I could afford a spontaneous steak dinner.

Unless the person who's taking you out specifically okays it then you don't order the most expensive food on the menu expecting them to pay for it.\n\nPlus it's his own fault for not being able to go back to his favourite restaurant, he chose to dine and dash to force OP to pay.", ">Good luck now, that ship is long sailed!\n\nNo kidding, now there's many folk in their mid to late 20's who still live at home because rent is sky high, getting on the social housing list is an extremely long wait,and let's not even get in to the housing market. Where I'm from being a local owning your own home is a pipe dream at best.\n\nIts fucking ridiculous.", "and if you think about it, as women are getting stronger and more outspoken, even more restrictions are imposed upon us.
