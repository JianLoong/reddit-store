You don't get to go to her house and disregard her rules.  Perhaps the larger group should start planning get-togethers at locations where she ISN'T in control.

I'm not saying you have to play with Jimmy to be a good person or anything, but it does sounds like you like Jimmy and want a relationship with him, you are just busy being a mom!

Can't you just have one parent play a round of cards with him while the other holds the baby, and then switch? I'm not seeing what's difficult with it.

YOUR kids should be YOUR priority. Just as HER kid is HERS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" and then she said but we have to take Jimmy with us \" .. SHE had the option to come and take her kid to the beach, this is on HER.", "You\u2019re NTA but it also sounds like it\u2019s time to stop vacationing with your husband\u2019s aunt. Go all in on a vacation rental instead.", "Your kids are your responsibility. Her kids are her responsibility. That's that. NTA", "Nta", "NTA.  Jimmy is his mom's responsibility, not everyone's.  Anything you do for him is extra.  You may wish to limit visits to their house for shorter periods of time and also explain to her that when on vacation, it's up to her to take care of him, take him places and supervise.  Don't give in to her guilt trips.  If she needs a break, she needs to ask for one like an adult, not treat her relatives like babysitters.", "OP and their family should stop vacationing at the aunt's house too. It's not worth the hassle.", ">I\u2019d just cut back on that\n\nAgreed. You and your husband have just recently became parents and you don\u2019t need the extra stressor of her getting mad at you two for behaving rationally.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I think a lot of people are overlooking the fact that all the conflict OP has mentioned is happening in Jimmy's home. SIL and Jimmy are not coming to OPs house and making demands. Doesn't reddit usually love the phrase your house, your rules? Quote from the OP:  \"Jimmys mom says that we are all mean and shouldn't come over to her house\" and \"we were on vacation at Jimmys Family's Beach house\".\n\nI'm going with ESH. SIL is being overbearing, but OP is an AH for going to Jimmy's home and complaining about Jimmy.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "True. I have a similar experience among my friends. Once this child was away from the one parent and came into the care of the other, she transformed and was suddenly able to do many more things, things she could not before that, just because the one parent kept her more disabled than she really was.", "My husband had a cousin whose was severely disabled. The parents ( his uncle and aunt) simply laid him on the floor and he laid there all day. I told my husband they aren\u2019t even trying to stimulate the cousin at all and they have no idea what he was capable of doing. There were 7 children in the family and when ma and pa died the cousin was placed in a nursing home. He was trained to use the potty for the first time. The staff concluded that for his own well being, he would be better served in a group home setting. Since he qualified aid it was no problem getting it set up. He is now thriving as a forty year old man.", "It sounds like Jimmy is capable of understanding boundaries, but be careful when you are comparing a neurotypical five year old to someone who is an adult with the cognitive capabilities of a 5 yr old.  First, it is really just a shitty comparison.  Someone \"with the brain of a 5 year old\" is still an adult.  They don't actually have a brain of a 5 yr old.  They have decades of life experience and an adult body with adult hormones.  Do my 12 yr old students still love \"Pete the Cat\"?  Sure.  But they are 100% 12 yr olds.  They have middle school attitudes.  They have middle school hormones.  They get crushes, they have middle school fall outs with their friends etc.  Yes they still play with trains, but they are playing with trains while flirting with their girlfriend.  \n\nAll that being said, academically and cognitively their capabilities are probably on par with many 5 yr olds.   I still can't just go online to teachers pay teachers and grab lessons for kindergarten.  They need 1:1 instruction that are modified for their specific needs.  While I could probably explain certain things to neurotypical 5 yr olds with no problem, my students will often still need more scaffolding with something like a social story.", "The post says that it was Jimmy's family's beach house, so I assume wither she owns it or holds a lease. The post also makes it sound like the issue mainly crops up when they go to visit Jimmy's family, so I feel like there's a relatively simple solution to this problem.", "Agreed.\n\n> Jimmys mom says that we are all mean and shouldn't come over to her house\n\nSo don't go there.  Seems like it would solve a lot of problems.\n\n> we were on vacation at Jimmys Family's Beach house\n\nAnd don't go there either.  Jimmy's mom is being unreasonable, but FFS, stop expecting to use her pool when it's hot outside.", "I suspect it\u2019s Because it\u2019s a free beach house to stay at for the greedy OP.", "NAH, but only because you\u2019re overwhelmed as a new parent, and it seems like the other siblings/cousins are having trouble with it too.\n\n  \nWTF does this even mean, are you saying she would be AH if she hadnt just had a newborn? Because that would be an insane take.", "Sure, but they need to also stop using the Aunt\u2019s vacation home to have a leg to stand on.", "Timers are an excellent solution for all children. Most realize they can't argue with a timer!", "Except that it\u2019s literally her pool.  I\u2019d say the aunt is well within her rights to say no one uses my pool today.  \n\nThe beach, OP has more leverage as it\u2019s a public place.  But really, this would likely all be solved if OP didn\u2019t feel entitled to use the families home/vacation home.", "Your aunt needs therapy and support from professionals experienced in handling adult dependents.", "OP is at jimmy\u2019s mom\u2019s house and complaining about the resident (jimmy). \n\nBlocking the aunt means to also not get to use her beach house. OP just wants to have free use of beach house with aunt or jimmy. OP is huge greedy AH", "[removed]", "I'm guessing in this case it wasn't the illness. Given the rest of the story, I'm betting Jimmy can't swim/can't be relied on to behave safely in the water if he's not supervised by an adult.", "Probably an ear infection. You can feel fine on antibiotics, but still cant get water in your ears. Happens to my nephew sometimes.", "They're at the vacation house, but even if they were at their regular home and not on vacation, people do not need to play with your kid in order to be there. Even if this was an able bodied 5 year old and not just an adult who is mentally a 5 year old with physical disabilities, who is sick on top of that, they should not be required to play with your child to be there. That's a ridiculous requirement. I would never expect my cousins or siblings to come visit and only do things with my child or not come at all. What a terrible vacation that would be for them.", "op isnt complaining about jimmy, op is complaining about jimmys mom. jimmy understands boundaries and isnt forcing anyone to play with him. op should be allowed to see jimmy and other family members without being yelled at.", "You're right to call out this is happening on SIL's property.  Everybody can fall in line or get lost.\n\nIs SIL being a pain?  Yeah, but if there is any place you can be a pain, it is your own house.", "It's really sad to see.  On the one hand I really get \"bad parent\" behavior when it comes to kids with special needs.  As a teacher with access to ipads, I 100% get parents of autistic kids who let their kids on tech all day.  Does it drive me nuts?  Yes. But I get it.  I also totally get parents who indulge their kid to prevent temper tantrums and melt downs.  Is it best practice?  No.  Does it make my life easier and is it best for their kid?  No.  But I completely get it.  I also get parents who are over protective and don't push their kids for independence.  A lot of them are told when their kids are very young that their kids will always rely on them and there are 1000's of things their kid will never be able to do, it's no wonder that they have low expectations!  As a special ed teacher, it is hard for *me* to balance reality with high expectations.  I'm constantly discovering that my students are more capable than my preconceived notions in surprising areas (I discovered one of my students can sew the other day when she took over sewing a hole in her jacket that I was fixing!  She did an amazing job).  I can't imagine it is any easier for parents who's only qualifications are life experience and the random chance of birth.", "I agree that op is NTA, but yall are both trying to put it in op's head that this could be the case with Jimmy and I don't think that's cool. Just because you two personally saw disabled people who were actually more independent than they let on doesn't mean that's the case here and it's a disservice to all actual disabled people to start spreading the word around that they could be faking it to some extent. This is coming from the father of a recently deceased mentally and physically disabled child. As if the disabled don't have it hard enough in this society, the last thing they need is able bodied, mentally fit people sowing distrust about them.", "Your use of \"scaffolding\" just made a whole bunch of things fall into place for me about how my own brain works. Thank you!", "Yea that\u2019s where OPs argument falls flat, like they went for a free vacation at aunts house that they already know babies Jimmy to a large degree. I don\u2019t know what they expected?", "I'm confused.. I get not going to aunts house,  but the vacation home sounds like it is the whole family's vacation home.Eta: nevermind. Reread it, and they need to just stop going to these peoples homes.", "Timers are magic for some of my students, and they love them.  I'd probably get resentful of constant timers but I think my students think of it as a game.", "Lol.\n\nNowhere in the post did she say that.\n\nThat isn't at all what they're doing and you ignored ALL of the context.\n\nThis sub isn't for you.", "Ok.  Except its really Jimmys mom\u2019s house.  So it still stands that OP is going into jimmy\u2019s mom\u2019s house and complaining about her.\n\nIt reads like this is less about wanting to see Jimmy and more about using his families things.  And being annoyed that she has to deal with him (and his mom) while doing so.", "no one is saying hes faking being disabled, or that he isn't going to need support throughout his life. just that he probably doesnt need to be coddled 24/7 in order for him not to have a meltdown. op even says that jimmy understands boundaries and is okay with op not playing with him when shes busy, but his mom acts like hes a second away from having a meltdown if you dont do exactly what he says.\n\nive worked at a camp for kids and adults who are disabled like jimmy is, and the majority of them understand the word \"no\" and are okay with doing something by themselves or with another camper if i need to step away for a little bit. jimmys mom wont even allow something like that, and that's the problem here.", "\u201cThe last straw was when we were on vacation at Jimmys Family\u2019s beach house\u201d \n\nOp doesn\u2019t want to hang out with jimmy?

Everyone else was not sick and didn't want to spend their vacation indoors.\n\nTheir reasons are fair and reasonable. Just because they're at the beach house doesn't mean they're slaves to be locked inside and forced to spend their vacation playing tabletop games with Jimmy. \n\nAgain. Different situations require different approaches and they shouldn't be forced to forego their vacation for Jimmy.\n\nThey weren't refusing to interact with him, they wanted to spend some of their vacation doing what they wanted.\n\nStop ignoring the context, cherry picker.", "Your solution of blocking The aunt doesn\u2019t work at all given the fact that they are staying at the aunt\u2019s house.", "Yes, it does, because they were only vacationing at the beach house, they don't fucking live there.\n\nJesus, did you comprehend any of this post at all?"]}
