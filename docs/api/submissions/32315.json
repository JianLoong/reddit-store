His 2 brothers have kinds too (3/3/1 year old). His aunt has a disabled son (25m) who I will call Jimmy.\n\nJimmy is Physically and mentally disabled (he is like a 5 year old boy can't properly walk/hold things ect.). I really love Jimmy and I am trying to do everything to make him happy but since I had my baby I can't focus on what he wants if that affects what my baby needs.\n\nFor example he want to play with his ball and some card games (he doesn't understand the rules everyone just throws a card until its done) all the time. The problem is if I feed my baby or he is sleeping in my arms or anything else I can't play with him because I have my hands full.\n\nI think he does understand it a bit but he doesn't stop saying I should play with him until my husband tells him to leave me alone. But then Jimmys mom will freak out and yell at us and tell us we should do what jimmy wants but I simply CANT. (he always rotates on which he wants to play with but we all have kids so im not the only one who this happens with).\n\nJimmys mom says that we are all mean and shouldn't come over to her house if we only want to bring negative energy and make her baby sad. None of us is trying to make Jimmy sad and I really think (I know him for 8 years) that he understands if you tell him loud and clear but his mom just wants him to have everything and therefore just tells us to do what he wants and then Jimmy is confused plus he knows if his mom is there he gets everything he wants (if we are alone with him this doesn't happen because if we tell him 3 times we can't play he says ok and goes on).\n\nThe last straw was when we were on vacation at Jimmys Family's Beach house which has a pool. We were all there but Jimmy got sick because he has a weaker immune system than we have.\n\nWe and the 4 kids wanted to go into the pool because it was like 100 degrees outside but Jimmys mom said we can't because Jimmy can't and that's unfair (Edit: she wanted us to sit inside and play games with Jimmy but how do you tell 4 kids that they can't go swimming bc Jimmys sick?). Fair enough I understand that but it was so hot and the kids wanted to go swimming so we told her we will go to the beach and then she said but we have to take Jimmy with us because he wants to come too witch doesn't make sense because 1 he can't go into the water what are we supposed to do with him and 2 we have 4 kids and no time to take care of him especially if we go swimming with kids with is dangerous.\n\nEveryone looked around and no one wanted to say anything so my husband and I told her the reasons why we can't take him with us. Jimmys mom freaked out and said that we are bullying her son and are treating him bad and not equally because he is disabled and I told her that we can't treat him equally because he is disabled it doesn't make any sense. Then I told her we could say we go somewhere not fun so he wants to stay at home and watching tv. She told me I am being a bad human being for lying to him so that he doesn't want to come and that we are excluding him and she throw us out of the house.
