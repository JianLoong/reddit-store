You don't get to go to her house and disregard her rules.  Perhaps the larger group should start planning get-togethers at locations where she ISN'T in control.

This is such an elementary solution to your problem that for the life of me I can't imagine why you haven't seen it already. You really needed Reddit for this one?", "She is not complaining about Jimmy. She loves Jimmy, but can not prioritize his wants before her newborns needs. Aunty seems to demand that, though.", "I think it's getting downvoted because OP's aunt in law is demanding OP neglect and/or starve her baby to play with Jimmy? Some people have a problem with that, I guess.", "This is very interesting as the aunt of a young autistic boy; the last time I saw him, I became aware of the fact that, while he is non-verbal, he absolutely understands what we are saying. That was eye opening. Thank you for what you do. \u2665\ufe0f", "As the older sister of an autistic man, who spent her teen years raising him and then the last two years as his caregiver, nobody is saying that anyone is faking it. \n\nHowever, when a parent is overprotective and takes at face value \u201cyour child will never do x y or z\u201d, and then never encourages any kind of development, they\u2019re doing their kid a disservice.  The kid isn\u2019t faking it; they\u2019ve just never been given the chance to explore and find their niche. \n\nMy brother taught himself how to read and write in Arabic at 11 years old, he did math equations for fun - he\u2019s incredibly smart: probably smarter than everyone else in my family combined, and we\u2019ve got astronomy professors, physics professors, and neuroscientists.. but he can\u2019t be allowed to go for a walk by himself, because he\u2019ll wander into the road or get lost (we know because he\u2019s tried).  \n\nHe\u2019s not faking his disability or that he needs constant care and supervision, but he IS capable of quite a lot. He can do some things I\u2019ll never be able to do, but he also cannot do other things that I take for granted. \n\nIf our parents had babied him and never let him explore his capabilities, he would come across as even more disabled than he is. \n\nI am sorry for your loss. I lost one of my other little brothers to suicide this year. But I have to say, I think your grief is clouding your judgement on this issue. If reading things like this is painful for you and causing you to lash out the way you are, it might be good to take a break from Reddit or at least certain areas of it. I know I had to.", "He's 25. If he genuinely can't understand NO he needs to be in a residential care home for the safety of himself and others.", "I've successfully used timers with my own children and with students. The only bad experience was the student who insisted the timer was broken because it went from 1:00 to :59 (one minute to 59 seconds) He could only see it as going straight from 100 to 59!", "ok so Jimmys dad is the Uncle of my husband he loves his 3 nephews and invites us over all the time (I don't even come 60% of the time) if he's there the Aunt doesn't say anything like that and everything is fine but he is self employed and leaves in the middle of the visit most of the time and then Jimmys mom says these things. Jimmy comes over to us like 2 a month that's why I know he hears if she is not there. And this was the first vacation at their house since the boys were like 5 years old.", "I agree. I think the aunt likes to have people around for Jimmy to socialize with (and probably give her a bit of a caregiver\u2019s break!). OP wants to be able to enjoy aunt\u2019s lake house but doesn\u2019t like the strings that come attached to it. The aunt has made plain that she doesn\u2019t want them to come around if they\u2019re going to be negative about Jimmy\u2026.which means no lake house for them. I think that\u2019s what OP is really pissed about. \n\nAnd PS\u2014why does it matter if he understands the rules to the card game or not?!  That sounded unnecessarily rude and ableist.", "See, thing is, the person voted on ESH. That means everyone is wrong in a way. OP presented more than just one situation, and while the aunt is absurd to want OP to prioritize the guy over her baby, OP also mentioned situations where the baby is irrelevant, such as going to the pool. I believe the aunt's mothering is far from ideal and demands with other family members are nonsensical, but the aunt also gave the solution herself: not visiting. You *can* make someone's visits conditional to how they interact with a family member.\n\nBut I guess being sarcastic to go with the flow is more important than actually seeing what people have to say.", "Why did you think before?", ">Fair enough I understand that but it was so hot and the kids wanted to go swimming so we told her we will go to the beach and then she said but we have to take Jimmy with us\n\nAre we just ignoring this bit for some reason?\n\n\"My son is too sick for the pool, but you ***must*** take him with you to the beach, also enjoy watching him in addition to your own kid.\"\n\nAre we pretending this is okay? I didn't realize hosting a family vacation gave you carte blanche to foist your sick kids onto other people, and that the other people are completely disallowed from doing anything on their own.", "But what is Jimmy's mum doing , she is happy enough to tell you what you should be doing with her son but not actually doing stuff with him herself ?, she isn't helping by continuing to treat her son like a child.even a young child has a basic understanding of how life is.", "Aunt is using the family to get a break from jimmy. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s incredibly difficult to take care of him and see no end in sight but manipulating family is not the way to get a break. I agree with those saying to just stay away for awhile. You\u2019ve got your hands full with your baby!!  NTA. In fact you seem to be the rational one.", "I feel like OP wants to vacation at the aunt\u2019s house but not have to \u201cpay\u201d for it in any way (ie, spending time with Jimmy). Either stop taking the free vacations or suck it up and hang with Jimmy. You can\u2019t have it both ways. ESH.", "NTA.\n\nI'm a mom of a severely special needs kid. It would be bonkers if I forced everyone to play with my son. There are things he can do, and things he simply can't. Reality is a bitch, but that's part of the \"special needs\", he needs things differently.\n\nIt's not up to cousins extended family to give up their lives to appease Jimmy. It's up to Jimmy's mom and dad to teach him \"No\", and that we don't always get a turn even if we want to. Life sucks sometime, but with distraction they can forget and move on to something they would enjoy.\n\nBeing included in the holiday is awesome! Being strapped to the hip, was probably not part of the deal though. I would have suggested if the kids want to swim and Jimmy isn't feeling well... give him a nice movie day with cuddles where he can't see the pool. If you don't loudly advertise \"Hey Jimmy we're excluding you! Na na na na poo poo\", he'll go on to have a wonderful day.\n\nTldr; special needs kids are still people, they are no better or worse than others. He deserves to have a good time, but so does every other person there. It is not your job to accommodate at every turn.", "NTA- unfortunately Jimmy's mom is fatigued from parenting him (where is the dad?) and has become so overly focused on \"protecting\" him that she can't see how unreasonable she is. I work with disabled children and adults, and I still would have taken my kids to the beach or pool), not to be cruel to Jimmy but to also be fair to my kids on vacation.\n\nI would now limit when you go, try to find activities where you have lots of help and can devote attention to Jimmy and still be a mom to your kids.", "NTA you have a baby and have to put his needs first if he\u2019s sleeping/eating or whatever. You do not have to play with jimmy, she could to or could take him wherever instead of pushing him on you.

I have rules that everyone is expected to follow. \n\nYes, at the start - there are many meltdowns because for the first time the kids are being given rules, expectations and consequences! But it really doesn\u2019t take long for them to realise - I\u2019m not the bad person here! I reward positive behaviour accordingly. \n\nAt the end - many parents thank me for enforcing my rules and they also implement them into their homes because they realise it is so much easier to have rules because then everyone can live in harmony. \n\nThe aunt here is an enabler. She also could be in denial and needs to come to terms with her son\u2019s disability and what he can/cannot do. \n\nYou just stay firm and continue to communicate what you are willing to do and what you\u2019re unable to do. If she doesn\u2019t like it and carries on - then ignore that behaviour because if you engage - you\u2019re then enabling HER behaviour. \n\nYou\u2019re not disrespecting Jimmy - he clearly knows boundaries (likely from when he was at school) and respects your boundaries after you have told him (yes it sometimes takes a little repeating but that\u2019s fine!).", "I totally agree with all of this, and I also have something to add. \n\nAs a disabled person myself, I can say with confidence that treating people \u201cequally\u201d is not always good or fair. I have a lot of trouble with strenuous activities, it\u2019s very painful and difficult for me. If some of my friends or family wanted to go on a hike, they wouldn\u2019t invite me. Simple as that. OP is 100% correct for not wanting to bring Jimmy along to the beach for that very reason. It would probably wind up being a miserable experience for him as well as everyone else.", "This is exactly what I was thinking.  She's keeping Jimmy from his potential", "Over here they pay parents to be carers. THe agency I work with that takes older disabled people, often cause the parents have died...
