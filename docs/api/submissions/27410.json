{"id": 27410, "submission_id": "16pd2mv", "title": "AITA for insisting my professor let me take the exam instead of making me walk to pick her child up from school?", "selftext": "I (20f) go to a small liberal arts college. I am in my junior year but I'm trying to put myself on track to graduate a semester early with honors. I'm a psychological science major and spend a lot of time in that department. I work in the psychology department, the sociology/anthropology department, and for the admissions office. I'm currently working with a professor to set up my own research project that hopefully you all will one day see published (cross your fingers for significant results). I've designed this project mostly by myself with some oversight from the professor and I'm now introducing it to the lab team to carry out. I take 4 classes (one with a lab) and 1 is a 300 level class while the rest are 200 level. That being said I'm extremely busy and don't have a lot of extra time to mess around. If I can manage to find extra time it's either spent working on projects, eating, sleeping, or sometimes with my partner and/or friends.  \nThis brings us to yesterday where I had an exam for my anatomy/physiology course. We had taken the same exam the day before in a collaborative group, but today we were to take it alone and make sure we went more in depth on the questions. I get to class and look over her notes on the exam for yesterday before taking a seat and waiting for her to pass out the exams (this is scheduled class time). She continues joking around with students for another 10 minutes before telling us that we're all going on a short walk to the local elementary to pick up her child as some sort of 'fun' field trip. I, in what I think is reasonably respectful way, ask her if this is required and if I can just take the exam. She goes on to say that her child is very excited to come to this class, but once again I ask if I can just take my exam instead so that I can leave early so I have extra time during my day. She agrees to let me stay in the lab and do the test while everyone else goes to pick up her kid. I'm the only one who stays behind, but I was fine with that.  \nFor extra clarification, this was around 2:30 and due to my schedule I didn't have time to eat lunch today and it was very hot outside and had been given no previous notice of this excursion. In my head, I find it disrespectful of her to come to class and waste my time when I pay her the respect to not do the same for her. Additionally, I pay around $15,000 a semester to go here and don't agree with her using class time meant for learning to do activities like pick her child up from school. I mentioned my displeasure to another classmate today though and they found it ridiculous that I disagreed with her using the time to pick up her kid and insisting I stay behind to just get the exam over with.

I mean I see why no one argued with her on it, but at the end of the day she\u2019s there to teach not to play schoolhouse. Idk if there\u2019s anything to be done about it, but definitely NTA for being annoyed at the unprofessionalism", "What the actual fuck? This is SO unprofessional of your professor. NTA, and I'd be reporting her.", "NTA. Consider going to the Dean of the appropriate school; that's BS.\n\n> I pay around $15,000 a semester to go here and don't agree with her using class time meant for learning to do activities like pick her child up from school.", "NTA\n\nThis is just weird. She doesn't need to escort an entire class of adult-aged students around. If she wanted to run out and up her kid, she multiple other choices available to her--pass out the test and leave and trust her students aren't going to cheat, call for a proctor/admin to sit and proctor the exam.", "NTA\n\nI feel for your professor (child care and school logistics are a whole thing and sounds like maybe the normal plan fell through) but it was unprofessional and disruptive.", "NTA\n\nI would write an anonymous e-mail to the head of the department to discuss this. She should have rescheduled the exam if she was going to be bringing a child into the room.", "NTA.\n\nThat's weird a professor wants the entire college class of students to walk to her kids school for pickup. None of you are there to be walking buddies, you're trying to further your education for a career. If this is a regular occurrence, you should report her. She's acting unprofessionally and there was an exam.", "If this happened repeatedly during class time you have a legitimate complaint. One time at a small, liberal arts college where the professor to student relationship is more personal and informal though? You need to let this go. You sound like someone with a more rigid thought structure than the norm (which is fine--it has positives as well as negatives) and some anxiety so perhaps consider that your reaction to situations is 100% valid but might not align with most people's.\n\nI've had seminars held in pubs or coffee restaurants in undergrad. I've had meetings held at professor's homes because of childcare and other life issues both as an undergrad and grad student. It's not unusual small schools or close knit departments. You should probably let this go. \n\nIf you complained to the department chair or dean you would be well within your rights. However, I wouldn't be surprised if other professors, students, professional staff, and graduate students (if your school/department has them) heard about this and would not be as willing to write you a recommendation, review your honor's thesis and offer in depth feedback, offer to have you on the team to write a joint research paper, etc. I'm not saying they would retaliate, but academia is a small world and operates on a fair amount of good will and relationship building, especially at a small liberal arts school. That's just the reality of the culture.", "NTA. That is inappropriate not to mention wildly unprofessional of your professor. I would report her. College is expensive and I would be pissed if I had to delay a class or exam to do something like this. She should have gotten someone to proctor her exam for her and picked up her kid on her own.", "NTA the professor should have made plans for someone to pick up the child and bring them to her.", "NTA.  Rude?-No.  Irrational?-No.  Stupid?-Yes.\n\nYou ever hear the expression, live by the sword; die by the sword.  Yup, that's you.  Next time you need an extension on a paper--nope, so sorry.  This answer on the test, interpretation could go either way--that answer is wrong.  \n\nTake it from somebody who is approaching retirement--every time my boss says walk with me to get a cup of coffee, even if I have 50 things to do, I walk with him to get a cup of coffee.  \n\nYou know that research project you've developed--yeah doesn't belong to you it belongs to the college (read all those forms you signed when you agreed to go to that college).  If your professor wants to take it over and put his name first he can, if he wants to take your name off of it-he can.  \n\nEverybody breaks rules every day, you want to be pedantic and not walk with your professor to pick up their child--you don't have to.  But when your professor doesn't do things they don't have to (give you extension, add your name to paper), don't be surprised or upset.", "NAH. \n\nCollege professor here. This \u201cwalk\u201d represented a time to get out of class, build camaraderie, and establish a more informal relationship between faculty and students\u2014all very typical of a small college experience. \n\nYou didn\u2019t want to take part in this activity, and that is fine. Your professor accommodated your request, which is also fine. Everyone did what they were supposed to, and there is no problem with any of this. \n\nRelax and move on.", "Look I get you somewhat, I also get why your classmates actually enjoyed a breather.  I think this was fine, you did your test, and others had a \"field trip\" she did not give you a hard time nor did she make you go, you were within your rights to ask to stay so kind NAH . \n\nYeah it was an unprofessional move, but then again small-group colleges where professors tend to have more of a relationship with their students work in a bit more informal way. We went to an indian restaurant instead of one of the seminars with our math teacher. Sure we learned something as well since we discussed some related topics over the food, but of course it was less informative than a regular class, then again it was a nice break and we got to know our teacher better soooo nobody really complained honestly.  Me and some of my friends had other similar experiences, I would say it is not as unusual.", "ESH\n\nIf the class is 2 hours, the field trip was just like taking 30 minutes out, so last 90 was the class or some like that, \n\nYea they should have just sent an email class was going to start 30 minutes late so everyone could take a break.  That would have been the kindest option.  \n\nBut life happens, it may have been some sort of private emergency needed to pick up kid but they weren\u2019t telling you understandably.  So they made a mistake\n\nI would have given grace, or asked if I could stay and study, then talked to them afterwards that your schedule is really busy so you\u2019d appreciate a heads up if class was starting late if possible.\n\nYou know\u2026communicate without assuming disrespect or ill intent.  Isn\u2019t that what you want to do?", "NAH, you got to stay and take the exam as requested, and it doesn\u2019t sound like the professor is retaliating against you. If your classmates weren\u2019t bothered by it, and you haven\u2019t been harmed, just let it go.", "YTA\n\nYou already said that you\u2019ve already taken this exam as a group, so what are you gaining or learning by doing it again? It sounds like that class day was just garbage time and the professor recognized it and chose to do something different instead.\n\nAnd don\u2019t bring up the tuition stuff, that really makes you look like TA - you\u2019re in school to fill a checkbox on your resume, very little you learn will be directly applicable to the jobs you will have in the future, just chill out.", "She should be fired", "not gonma lie, you sound a little entitled but you are 100% correct. since she let you take the exam - NAH", "You sound extremely entitled. But I do agree, it was unprofessional of your professor to go to the elementary school during class time (unless it was specifically part of the learning experience). You should maybe take your concern to the department chair.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Report her to the dean", "NTA. \n\nThat's just unprofessional behavior. If your response was as described, you were polite and demanded professionalism. Might be a bit of a sting to the prof's ego, but earned in my opinion.\n\nI had a prof who used the GIGANTIC screen in the lecture hall to show \"Babe\" before our final exam (ungodly early morning exam) to entertain his kid. I was upset because I had been hoping to have a quiet hour or so in my preferred seat to review my study notes. \"Babe\" was just a little bit distracting, to say the least.", "NTA. Look, I\u2019m disabled, and it\u2019s an invisible disability. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do a walk like this, lunch or not, and would have had to insist that I simply do my test as well. It\u2019s a waste of your time, not every student has the capacity for a variety of reasons to do this walk, and fighting with you about it was rude. She should have gotten her daughter early in order to be ready for class. It also pisses me off because as a disabled person, I\u2019ve spent 8+ hours in my wife\u2019s office when she worked at a college so that she could give me a ride to a 10 minute doctor\u2019s appointment and still do the job she needed doing. You find work arounds, but they should not be at the cost of your students. Hell, she even could have sent an email telling people that class was going to start late and gotten her daughter alone!", "NTA. What the professor asked was inappropriate.", "ESH.  You sound exhausting.  Your professor offered to get everyone outside and do something fun and show her kid what great students she has.  You stuck your nose in the air and you're to good for that.    What she did was not professional but reporting her seems like a real petty thing to do.", "Nta\n\nHorribly unprofessional on her part.

I don't like walking and I am not very fit due to medical reasons, so I would have been exhausted after walking there and back.

I\u2019d make a report of that to the PTBs at the college.  It was totally inappropriate for the instructor.", "Absolutely. I work in a dean\u2019s office. That shit would NOT be tolerated. You are there to learn, and making you accompany her for errands hinders that.", "Yeah, this is why I'm not doing anything beyond just insisting she let me take the exam. As a woman who wants a higher education and a job, but also kids one day I do understand that things come up that you can't control, but I also have really bad anxiety (that I'm medicated for) so the sudden announcement that we are walking to the elementary school then taking the test really put my already frazzled nerves more on edge. I just wanted to get it done with and finish class so I could move on to thinking about something else ya know. I just started wondering if my insistence was rude and irrational because everyone else in the class seemed to think I was weird for insisting on taking the exam.", "Yep. I remember a couple times we ended up holding class at this one professor's home instead of the classroom because she had childcare fall through. But it was walking distance from campus and she made it clear no one would be penalized for not attending. It was kind of fun, actually - we got snacks. But I would have looked askance if it were mandatory or if we took time out of class to hang with the kids instead of normal discussion.", "Definitely understandable but these are adults, college students. Just like how OP did, the rest could\u2019ve stayed behind taken the test and left.", "Since op was the only one staying behind the teacher wouldn't even have to think about who ratted her out. OP NTA, but don't write this letter.", "Yeah it so entitled to expect to a teacher using class time for class activities when you are paying 10s of thousands of dollars for that class time.", "Out of genuine curiosity, since it was mentioned more than once now, what exactly makes me sound so entitled in my post? Not be argumentative or anything, we can all have our own opinions, but in the spirit of working on myself I would love some more specifics if you can give them! Thanks!!", "Not really. I think it would depend on how you worded it. \n\nNot mentioning they stayed behind to take the test would be my only suggestion. \n\n\"I didn't feel comfortable speaking up, because everyone else in the class agreed to it. I didn't appreciate having my class time turn into a field trip to pick up the teacher's child. Only one classmate stayed behind.\"", "What's even crazier is that a lot of my tuition is taken care of my scholarships, but there's people here paying like 35,000 a semester here. I can't imagine the pressure and stress I'd feel to learn as much as possible if I was paying that each semester."]}
