{"id": 27410, "submission_id": "16pd2mv", "title": "AITA for insisting my professor let me take the exam instead of making me walk to pick her child up from school?", "selftext": "I (20f) go to a small liberal arts college. I am in my junior year but I'm trying to put myself on track to graduate a semester early with honors. I'm a psychological science major and spend a lot of time in that department. I work in the psychology department, the sociology/anthropology department, and for the admissions office. I'm currently working with a professor to set up my own research project that hopefully you all will one day see published (cross your fingers for significant results). I've designed this project mostly by myself with some oversight from the professor and I'm now introducing it to the lab team to carry out. I take 4 classes (one with a lab) and 1 is a 300 level class while the rest are 200 level. That being said I'm extremely busy and don't have a lot of extra time to mess around. If I can manage to find extra time it's either spent working on projects, eating, sleeping, or sometimes with my partner and/or friends.  \nThis brings us to yesterday where I had an exam for my anatomy/physiology course. We had taken the same exam the day before in a collaborative group, but today we were to take it alone and make sure we went more in depth on the questions. I get to class and look over her notes on the exam for yesterday before taking a seat and waiting for her to pass out the exams (this is scheduled class time). She continues joking around with students for another 10 minutes before telling us that we're all going on a short walk to the local elementary to pick up her child as some sort of 'fun' field trip. I, in what I think is reasonably respectful way, ask her if this is required and if I can just take the exam. She goes on to say that her child is very excited to come to this class, but once again I ask if I can just take my exam instead so that I can leave early so I have extra time during my day. She agrees to let me stay in the lab and do the test while everyone else goes to pick up her kid. I'm the only one who stays behind, but I was fine with that.  \nFor extra clarification, this was around 2:30 and due to my schedule I didn't have time to eat lunch today and it was very hot outside and had been given no previous notice of this excursion. In my head, I find it disrespectful of her to come to class and waste my time when I pay her the respect to not do the same for her. Additionally, I pay around $15,000 a semester to go here and don't agree with her using class time meant for learning to do activities like pick her child up from school. I mentioned my displeasure to another classmate today though and they found it ridiculous that I disagreed with her using the time to pick up her kid and insisting I stay behind to just get the exam over with.

She should have rescheduled the exam if she was going to be bringing a child into the room.", "NTA.\n\nThat's weird a professor wants the entire college class of students to walk to her kids school for pickup. None of you are there to be walking buddies, you're trying to further your education for a career. If this is a regular occurrence, you should report her. She's acting unprofessionally and there was an exam.", "If this happened repeatedly during class time you have a legitimate complaint. One time at a small, liberal arts college where the professor to student relationship is more personal and informal though? You need to let this go. You sound like someone with a more rigid thought structure than the norm (which is fine--it has positives as well as negatives) and some anxiety so perhaps consider that your reaction to situations is 100% valid but might not align with most people's.\n\nI've had seminars held in pubs or coffee restaurants in undergrad. I've had meetings held at professor's homes because of childcare and other life issues both as an undergrad and grad student. It's not unusual small schools or close knit departments. You should probably let this go. \n\nIf you complained to the department chair or dean you would be well within your rights. However, I wouldn't be surprised if other professors, students, professional staff, and graduate students (if your school/department has them) heard about this and would not be as willing to write you a recommendation, review your honor's thesis and offer in depth feedback, offer to have you on the team to write a joint research paper, etc. I'm not saying they would retaliate, but academia is a small world and operates on a fair amount of good will and relationship building, especially at a small liberal arts school. That's just the reality of the culture.", "NTA. That is inappropriate not to mention wildly unprofessional of your professor. I would report her. College is expensive and I would be pissed if I had to delay a class or exam to do something like this.

Rude?-No.  Irrational?-No.  Stupid?-Yes.\n\nYou ever hear the expression, live by the sword; die by the sword.  Yup, that's you.  Next time you need an extension on a paper--nope, so sorry.  This answer on the test, interpretation could go either way--that answer is wrong.  \n\nTake it from somebody who is approaching retirement--every time my boss says walk with me to get a cup of coffee, even if I have 50 things to do, I walk with him to get a cup of coffee.  \n\nYou know that research project you've developed--yeah doesn't belong to you it belongs to the college (read all those forms you signed when you agreed to go to that college).  If your professor wants to take it over and put his name first he can, if he wants to take your name off of it-he can.  \n\nEverybody breaks rules every day, you want to be pedantic and not walk with your professor to pick up their child--you don't have to.  But when your professor doesn't do things they don't have to (give you extension, add your name to paper), don't be surprised or upset.", "NAH. \n\nCollege professor here. This \u201cwalk\u201d represented a time to get out of class, build camaraderie, and establish a more informal relationship between faculty and students\u2014all very typical of a small college experience. \n\nYou didn\u2019t want to take part in this activity, and that is fine. Your professor accommodated your request, which is also fine. Everyone did what they were supposed to, and there is no problem with any of this. \n\nRelax and move on.", "Look I get you somewhat, I also get why your classmates actually enjoyed a breather.  I think this was fine, you did your test, and others had a \"field trip\" she did not give you a hard time nor did she make you go, you were within your rights to ask to stay so kind NAH . \n\nYeah it was an unprofessional move, but then again small-group colleges where professors tend to have more of a relationship with their students work in a bit more informal way. We went to an indian restaurant instead of one of the seminars with our math teacher. Sure we learned something as well since we discussed some related topics over the food, but of course it was less informative than a regular class, then again it was a nice break and we got to know our teacher better soooo nobody really complained honestly.  Me and some of my friends had other similar experiences, I would say it is not as unusual.", "ESH\n\nIf the class is 2 hours, the field trip was just like taking 30 minutes out, so last 90 was the class or some like that, \n\nYea they should have just sent an email class was going to start 30 minutes late so everyone could take a break.  That would have been the kindest option.  \n\nBut life happens, it may have been some sort of private emergency needed to pick up kid but they weren\u2019t telling you understandably.  So they made a mistake\n\nI would have given grace, or asked if I could stay and study, then talked to them afterwards that your schedule is really busy so you\u2019d appreciate a heads up if class was starting late if possible.\n\nYou know\u2026communicate without assuming disrespect or ill intent.  Isn\u2019t that what you want to do?", "NAH, you got to stay and take the exam as requested, and it doesn\u2019t sound like the professor is retaliating against you.

It sounds like that class day was just garbage time and the professor recognized it and chose to do something different instead.\n\nAnd don\u2019t bring up the tuition stuff, that really makes you look like TA - you\u2019re in school to fill a checkbox on your resume, very little you learn will be directly applicable to the jobs you will have in the future, just chill out.", "She should be fired", "not gonma lie, you sound a little entitled but you are 100% correct. since she let you take the exam - NAH", "You sound extremely entitled.

It\u2019s a waste of your time, not every student has the capacity for a variety of reasons to do this walk, and fighting with you about it was rude.

Haverford for example.  \n\n\nThis post could still be very fake but that part is not unbelievable", "Not that unusual, honestly. I went to major engineering college, and all of our exams were unsupervised. We were simply held to an Honor Code. Professors would pass put exams, but then they would go wait outside the room.", "Says they are graduating early but only taking one upper division class....", "Not that uncommon. I had to make up a few tests in college and the teacher just gave me the test and told me to leave on the desk when I was done.", "That\u2019s not the unbelievable part.

We all looked around like he was crazy, bug none of us cheated. After that, all our exams became take home exams. But he was really old and probably gave zero fucks if we did cheat", "Trump University?", "My junior year of college, I was taking a Sign Language course and the teacher made it clear--in the syllabus and in the first class--that we'd have a speaker coming on (date/time) and we needed to come and would be expected to write a paper about it. The class after that presentation, she announced that she'd recordedit and we were going to watch her recording for the class, in case anyone missed it. Several of us asked if we could leave, and were flat-out told no, and it was required. I watched about five minutes, then got my stuff and walked out. According to my classmates, she actually did a double-take, waited a couple minutes, then went to the hall to check I was actually gone. And after I left, others started doing the same, ignoring her Obviously Taking Names to dock points from our grades.\n\nWhen I calmed down, I wrote her an e-mail detailing exactly why what she did was disrespectful. She responded by trying to friend me on Facebook.

In this case though the concern is not super necessary. This professor oversees nothing for me, but this anatomy/physiology class and is not in the same department let alone building as my major. I have very wonderful relationships with professors and staff throughout the campus, but especially within the psychological science department and they won't be harmed by this incident. I do definitely agree with you though that connections are super important and I've made it an aim to become very familiar and liked by a lot of the professors and staff I see each day.", "This wasn\u2019t gaslighting.

I've got no stake in the game either way.", "Beautifully said lol", "An unproctored or take home exam I could buy, especially as it was a rehash of the same questions from an earlier test. One student sitting an exam utterly unsupervised while the rest of the class, who presumably still had to do the exam as well, were elsewhere? That's harder to swallow.", "That's nuts!", "Yeah, I\u2019ve almost never had the professor in the room for an exam in university. We were even allowed to take them home sometimes, even if they weren\u2019t open-book. My school (a liberal arts, but my degree was Chemistry) held its honor code in high esteem and treated us like adults, and people actually didn\u2019t cheat very often.", "I'm an undergraduate and at this college most of your core classes are in the 200 level. As a first year you usually take 100 levels but move on after that although some first years do take 200 level courses. My 300 level course is kinda like a capstone course. It's mostly discussion based and focused on a field that is still developing. At the end of the course you write a huge essay that counts for most of your grade. You are only required to take 1 and it's mostly seniors. That's just how my college does it.", "I mean it\u2019s one semester early. If she takes only one extra class for 3 years, she\u2019s done it.", "A test and an exam are different things in the college lexicon.", "Rather rarer to talk yourself out of his class so you could take it early I would think. Also a quiz and an exam are very different things at college level.", "That I believe. Academic staff do all sorts of daft things (I've got some good stories I can assure you). But exams are accredited at the level of the faculty and then the institution, not the individual. Examinations have to be properly scheduled and supervised. Very few institutions let the teacher of a module supervise exams at all, certainly not on their own. That shit is how colleges lose their accreditation.\n\nSo either this a) did not happen or b) this was not an exam, just some sort of in-class test, which for some reason nobody else in the class was annoyed about having rescheduled/cancelled. And if it was rescheduled then FFS just quietly skip out on the 'field trip'.", "Isn\u2019t Harvard a liberal arts college?", "A take home test is marked differently to an exam. Just like an open book test will have a different grading scale than a closed book one. This shit was my job thanks. Not 'cute'. Professional.", "I got a professor fired by speaking up. It was a class in sign language (useful, but not required) and she made a huge fuss about how we had to attend a lecture not during normal class time, there would be no accommodation, we had two months notice for when the speaker (signer) would be there, we had a paper due on it... class after the speaker she declared she'd decided to record it and we now all had to watch her recording and no you couldn't leave if you'd already seen it.\n\nI left anyway and wrote her a well-reasoned non-insulting e-mail about why she was unprofessional and why I walked out. She responded by trying to friend me on Facebook. I told a few other teachers about this, and she went from 'I've been working here five years and love it' to 'I'm moving to a friendlier area' by the semester's end.\n\nIf you can, I advise you do similarly: write the professor the calmest e-mail you can, detailing why you felt her behavior was unprofessional (I am paying a lot of money for this course and hate that I was then expected to do something completely different, I didn't have lunch so I could get to the exam on time, I was not dressed for a walk because of the previous issues). Try to be understanding (I know things come up in a parents' life but students shouldn't be penalized for it) and thank her for her time, then see what happens. I never actually reported my professor, though it was mentioned on the surveys (every class in my college had anonymous surveys given to students one week before the finals); I just mentioned the e-mail and her response to a few of my other teachers and they were shocked and upset on my behalf. It's entirely possible she'll apologize or, if anything does escalate (such as accusations of cheating because you didn't take the exam with others), you have a written account of what happened and why you did what you did.", "They may do so, but taking them to go pick up a kid from school is not one of them.\n\nAnd I used the term correctly.  Definition:  \u201cthe act or practice of grossly misleading someone especially for one's own advantage\u201d\n\nThis is *precisely* what you are doing when you indicate to op that it is normal practice and not a big deal for a prof to take an entire class to go pick up her damn kid from school.  \n\nYou sound utterly ridiculous.

Anxiety, ADHD, an Major Depressive Disorder along with some stomach problems make me really value my time on my good days because I know that at any point (as much as I try to control it) I could be unable to get out of bed or too panicky to go out in public or even just completely exhausted and unable to focus on anything. I hate surprises for this reason because I'm someone that genuinely does need to know what's coming up so I can plan accordingly. I don't necessarily fault her for the activity it's more the absolute lack of warning I received in the matter until class began.", "I mean, we're talking about a teacher, professor, who took her her class on a \"field trip\" to pick her kid up from school, and you think it's unbelievable that she has other questionable practices?", "Behavioural science masters person here,\nThis is one of the examples that made me switch over to full BH. It was one of the best examples of how correcting behavior isnt a straight line.\n\nI can see if i can find the exact research, but basically; people  cheat less AND it is easier to find out who cheated if you do it this way.\n\nEven better is to switch things up.

One, for coming up with such a bad lie because there is zero chance your teacher actually did this.  \n\nBut if we pretend this is nonsense is real, you\u2019re still an asshole for acting like you\u2019re the only person with stuff to do and for thinking you\u2019re entitled to leave early. \n\nIf you want to argue that class time isn\u2019t for teacher\u2019s errands (which I agree, it isn\u2019t), then it also isn\u2019t for students who overload their schedule to try to find \u201cextra\u201d time. \n\nIf class is scheduled from 2:30-3:45 then technically both you and your teacher should expect to be there for the duration of that time and your personal stuff should be for outside that time.", "NTA.

You have to be honest and treat your students like adults when it does.)", "NTA this seems not allowed?? Like couldnt she get in trouble for that", "NTA. This is outrageous. How entitled and deluded your professor is. And how unprofessional! And I say that as CC professor.", "NTA. That activity had nothing to do with your class. You need to report her to the department head or dean for wasting class time.", "She must be tenured.", "NTA. Very unprofessional behavior for the teacher. You were smart to hang back so you would have the full class time to take the exam. An unexpected field trip that pushes an exam back, allowing less time than usual to take an exam,would definitely impact the students. You should report her to the dean.", "NTA This is a situation where you ask a TA in the department to proctor the exam for you while you go get your kid.", "NTA. I think your professor had some sort of childcare emergency that she was trying to find a creative way to get around, and those are hard, so she's not an asshole, but neither are you one for not going along with it. School is school. Errands should not be involved. \n\nBut I do hope you can see that, while you are paying top dollar for your education, clearly your school is happy to leave its staff at risk of getting into these predicaments without much help available. So... I would be asking where that $15,000 is going, exactly. The school is the asshole.", "NTA her ridiculous childcare arrangements are her own matter, they should not be foisted upon a class she is teaching eating into time they are paying for.", "I've had classes that did walks and activities to get us out of the class, but never at the expense of exam time. If there wasn't an exam, you might have a point, but the exam makes the whole trip inappropriate and unprofessional. As a proffer, you should understand why making sure your students have the entire class time to do an exam is important.", "You're assuming the class is 2 hours when the class time isn't mentioned. It could easily be a 1 hour class, but we don't know. She should have canceled the class and rescheduled the exam if she couldn't be there the whole class time. That would have been the eight thing to do. No matter her intent, her actions were disrespectful to her students.", "Honor codes are not that uncommon.

Classes here rarely have standardized \"exams\" that are monitored by anyone independent, and this has nothing to do with accreditation. Exams/tests are devised and administered by the instructor as they choose. For the same course, one instructor may give a short answer test and another an open book essay test. There is no authority requiring any particular kind of test beyond whatever instructions the department may have given to their instructors. \n\nAs an example, my brother teaches at two colleges in the Boston area. The curricula he uses for his classes were devised by him, as were the tests, which he both gives and grades. Nobody is looking over his shoulder. Other instructors may use different textbooks and their curricula will be very different.

Harvard has a College of Liberal Arts, but when people talk about Harvard the first thing that pops into people's head isn't \"premier liberal arts college.\"\n\nI guess I am being overbroad in saying liberal arts but anything I choose would be offensive to some people.  Liberal arts also includes math and the theoretical sciences.  Which I don't think anyone would argue aren't rigorous.\n\nBut in the most literal sense of \"Liberal Arts\" attorney's and doctors are pretty much precluded.  And in the more colloquial sense I think are also precluded but I think that's where you might disagree.\n\n*Extremely lawyer voice* Also, if you are licensed in your jurisdiction you are an attorney sir."]}
