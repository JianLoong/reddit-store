(We do hope that discount didn\u2019t hurt you.)\n\n\u201cWe decided to speak to our banker, Tightwad Cheappants, at WTF Financial Services. After the emergency squad helped him recover from his laughing fit (he\u2019s fine now, thanks), he crunched some numbers for us as well. The best he can do for us is to:\n\n\u201c1. Have us take out an additional 30-year mortgage on the house;\n\n\u201c2. Sell the kids on the dark web (since both are so young, they should fetch a good price, and just cashing in their current college funds isn\u2019t nearly enough);\n\n\u201c3. Sell one kidney each from husband and I, with buyers allowed to option the other kidney and/or a lobe of liver at a time of their choosing (guaranteed to be at least 6 months after your wonderful wedding!).\n\n\u201cAnother possibility is for me to immediately undergo hormone therapy and superovulate. Good ol\u2019 Tighty has a friend who can get us a minimum of $10,000 per egg, and a forced ovulation of about 20 eggs should mostly cover our expenses.\n\n\u201cSo there you have it! We\u2019ll also be cutting back to 3 meals a week to help save; you can never be too thin, right?\n\n\u201cIf you have any other money-saving suggestions (again, can\u2019t thank you enough for the 2% discount), please let us know ASAP. We\u2019re SO EXCITED!\n\n\u201cLots of love \u2014 OP and family\n\n\u201cPS \u2014 Going to suggest some of these ideas to Mom and Dad.

That one was lucky, but places like the Real Real have TONS of gowns for very good prices that are new or practically new for pennies on their retail. \n\nI would try to make my sister's wedding, but I'd expect to not have to shell out thousands or take out a loan to do it.", "I just subtract cost of travel off of the wedding gift budget, if its over 300 dollars for travel, enjoy your nice card:)", "Exactly what I was thinking.", "Yeah, I mean, of it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

This is completely made up.", "yeah. the dress code might be the easiest to work around with thrift shops or facebook or whatever. but the rest of it, nope. its why people shouldnt do destination weddings unless they either can cover for family or know for a fact it wont interfere with their finances. like the kardashians can have all the destination weddings they want itll never hurt them.", "It\u2019s not how dress codes work, which makes me suspect this is embellished at least.

I don't understand it either. Like a label check? Wish OP would elaborate.", "Rich people are weird tbh.", "Yall need to read up some more on Bridezillas because you will absolutely see that this fits in the world of the absolutely insane people involved in wedding planning ( engaged couple, parents , ILs and etc) there are wedding stories about ppl getting kicked out for being pregnant even tho the couple knew the due date was around the wedding date yet still asked preggers to be MOH, people getting kicked out of the wedding party because the bride was afraid that the individual 's natural beauty/style would overshadow the bride on her special day, there are people who have been told not to being their S.O. to the wedding  because the invitees are an interracial couple and the engaged couple doesnt want said race/minority at the wedding at all( for the sake of uniformity in wedding photos) / asking Trans people to  wear clothing that is more in line with their gender that was assigned at birth and use their dead name.....the list goes on and on  and on.
