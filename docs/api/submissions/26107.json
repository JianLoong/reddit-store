I don't understand someone wanting to put their family under that kind of financial pressure.", "NTA 2% discount omg", "NTA, you just have a selfish sister. How could she allow her parents go in to debts just to attend a few hours event?...that's not enough she is pushing your family to do the same too!", "\u201cDear Sister:\n\n\u201cAfter crunching the numbers, husband and I were unable to afford your wedding despite the ultra-lavish 2% discount you offered. (We do hope that discount didn\u2019t hurt you.)\n\n\u201cWe decided to speak to our banker, Tightwad Cheappants, at WTF Financial Services. After the emergency squad helped him recover from his laughing fit (he\u2019s fine now, thanks), he crunched some numbers for us as well. The best he can do for us is to:\n\n\u201c1. Have us take out an additional 30-year mortgage on the house;\n\n\u201c2. Sell the kids on the dark web (since both are so young, they should fetch a good price, and just cashing in their current college funds isn\u2019t nearly enough);\n\n\u201c3. Sell one kidney each from husband and I, with buyers allowed to option the other kidney and/or a lobe of liver at a time of their choosing (guaranteed to be at least 6 months after your wonderful wedding!).\n\n\u201cAnother possibility is for me to immediately undergo hormone therapy and superovulate. Good ol\u2019 Tighty has a friend who can get us a minimum of $10,000 per egg, and a forced ovulation of about 20 eggs should mostly cover our expenses.\n\n\u201cSo there you have it! We\u2019ll also be cutting back to 3 meals a week to help save; you can never be too thin, right?\n\n\u201cIf you have any other money-saving suggestions (again, can\u2019t thank you enough for the 2% discount), please let us know ASAP. We\u2019re SO EXCITED!\n\n\u201cLots of love \u2014 OP and family\n\n\u201cPS \u2014 Going to suggest some of these ideas to Mom and Dad. There may actually be a market for her geriatric eggs, haha!\u201d\n\n(Just to be sure \u2014 SARCASM above)\n\nNTA, OP. I hope your sister stops sniffing sweat socks long enough to have a brush with reality. As people have pointed out, it\u2019s an invitation, not a summons, and \u201cNo\u201d is a complete answer. (\u201cOh, HELLS no!\u201d Is also appropriate if emphasis is required.)\n\nGood luck.", "I wouldn\u2019t go. And your parents are having ti take out a loan?", "Tell her to pay your way if she wants you there. \n\nNTA", "NTA stay away. You cannot afford it. That\u2019s it.", "NTA\n\n2%???? Why bother? That\u2019s an insult. I can\u2019t imagine taking out a loan to pay to attend a wedding, that is unreasonable and poor financial management. Your sister knows this is out of scope for your family, she needs to accept that.", "A 2% friends and family discount is not a discount, it's a rounding error. \n\nPersonality changes aside -- who among us didn't go throigh some shit during lockdown -- your sister chose to have this wedding at this exorbitant venue. Choices have consequences. One of the consequences is that her own sister can't attend. She can't dodge that consequence because it's inconvenient for her to be related to the 99%.\n\nMaybe she should sit with why she is okay with making her own parents take out loans on her behalf, amd instead of trying to pass the blame onto you making reasonable financial decisions. So NTA", "NTA", "NTA but i don\u2019t really understand how you cannot get \u201cunbranded \u201c clothes that fit the dress code? Also 30mins drive to get a cheaper accommodation is not that bad.", "\u201cThey\u2019ve got a team professional tailors at the door checking tags and measurements!!!\u201d\n\n\nOkay\u2026", "An invitation is not a summons. If you make an event difficult for people to attend (time, money, travel, etc) you can\u2019t get pissed when people can\u2019t come.

I can see she\u2019s offered a bit of assistance, but she\u2019s lost touch with reality if she doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with taking out loans for a singular event.", "Just had to add to this that I've always found it ridiculous that people will go into debt to throw a wedding.\n\nGetting a loan just to ATTEND one may be the most utterly ludicrous thing I've heard in a while.", "This, it sounds like she has a positive familial relationship, I could never understand having a wedding so lavish and expensive that I would cause my parents to require a loan to attend. Op nta if you sister truly wanted you there it wouldn't be this way", "Yes, I think it'd be more reasonable to make the wedding more affordable and then they'd also be able to put more money into their honeymoon or whathever they've got planned, where only they have to \"suffer\" from the extra self chosen costs", "NTA- good for you prioritising healthy financial boundaries. That venue sounds insane. I\u2019m sorry your sister has changed so much.", "This confused me too. Is there a designer label requirement? Is it formal? Consignment shops are an option. OP mentions gas cost. Is the wedding within driving distance? If it is drivable does OP and spouse need a hotel? can OP leave kids with a sitter? I\u2019ve said this many times on here. As a child I hated being forced to sit still through boring grown up events in clothes that I\u2019m supposed to not tear or get dirty. Either way. I can understand just sending a nice gift and your regrets.", "This really threw me too.  I know some serious old money people who belong to private clubs and wear regular mall brands. \n\nIf it's the hotel cost,  that's one thing,  but the clothes excuse makes no sense.  Anyone can put together a great formal look for next to nothing with Craigslist,  Poshmark or even Shein.", "Fake ones", "I am so sorry. That is so unfair.", "The point of destination weddings is to weed your contact lists.

OP is upset at her sister for changing and is coming up with an excuse not to go out of spite. A 40 min drive is just not very far. Designer clothes are clearly not a requirement. YTA definitely.", "My thought exactly. OP should wear whatever she\u2019d  normally wear to a wedding and stay at the cheaper hotel 30-40 minutes away, thus solving these problems.", ">Obnoxious displays of wealth are equivalent to obnoxious displays of discrimination towards the LBRQ+ community.\n\n\n\nOh lawd, no. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s actually helping.  \nShe\u2019s just organising slight discounts.  \n2% isn\u2019t really that good a discount when the room is really expensive", "She offered a whole 2% off though!

I can\u2019t imagine ever allowing my parents to take out loans to attend my wedding.

They will stay at the less expensive hotel, drive together and wear clothes they can afford and are comfortable in. \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t matter if sister want the kids at the wedding.
