He and my mom divorced when I was 5. My mom was his second wife. His first wife died about five years before my parents met. He had no kids with her but had wanted them. He never got over his first wife. She was always his one and only. But everyone was concerned about him and encouraged him to seek help and move forward with his life and his brother told him finding someone new to love would help. He met my mom and decided he would just pretend she was his first wife or something. Mom had some concerns but he told her all the right things and she was young (21) so she naively thought it was just how serious relationships go.\n\nWhen mom was pregnant with me she developed eclampsia and I had to be delivered by emergency c-section. On top of the seizures mom had a pretty major bleed. She didn't come around for a couple of weeks. In that time my father named me... after his late wife. Had all the paperwork submitted and everything while mom was sick. It was the beginning of the end for my parents even though mom stayed married to him for a few years after that.\n\nAfter the divorce my mom had primary custody and my father saw me every other weekend. He very clearly never wanted me. I hated being called his first wife's name, I hated how he would only talk about her. One day when I was 6 I told him he didn't love me he only loved her and he said that was right, that he loved her and only her and he never should have pretended he could ever love another woman or love children who were not born from her body. He said the only way he could tolerate me was by giving me her name.\n\nMy mom eventually helped me change my name, something that was complicated to do, but by then my father was no longer in my life.\n\nHis parents were and they were good to me. We are close. But now they are celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and they want me to attend while my estranged father will be there. I have not seen him or been around him for 10 years. I don't want that to change. They still want me there though and begged me. I told them I won't go since he'll be there but we can celebrate on our own before or after. My uncle said I should be there for them and I should give my father a chance, that maybe he's found a way to love me and want me in his life, that I should have compassion from him, he's all messed up, and even if he's a dick, my grandparents aren't.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681897603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rnmhs/aita_for_telling_my_grandparents_i_wont_go_to/", "score": 224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having to smile and look happy to not make it \u201cbad\u201d for your grandparents will add another layer of trauma.

I think your compromise was valid, and they can take it or leave it. If they really love you, they'll get over it.", "NTA. The only way your father could *tolerate* you was by giving you her name?

By inviting him, knowing this, they are effectively choosing to exclude you. Your suggestion to celebrate with them on an earlier date is a reasonable one, given that they've made it impossible for you to attend the event itself.\n\nAs an addendum - if they're hoping to engineer a reconciliation at this event, please help them understand that this is not the time or place for it. If your father had approached you separately wanting to make sincere amends, that would be one thing (though I don't personally think you should let him back in your life, even then). But throwing the two of you together and hoping that the pressure of all the other family there present will make you hug and make-up is guaranteed to end badly.", "Celebrations are NOT the times for reconciliations.  \n\nReconciliations should be done slowly, and on neutral ground.\n\nNTA", "NAH apart from dad and uncle.\n\nGrandparents are caught between two people they love- and on their own they haven't done anything wrong.

He was clearly actively harmful to you, and you are probably a million times better off without him.\n\nThat being said, this is a party for your grandparents, about your grandparents. You should make your decision about them, and go, but bring along a friend or partner to help you. Also, especially after you've made it so clear you don't want to be around him, if you go, even for a short time, that will mean a lot to them, since they'll know how much you are doing for them by coming. Also, you can always leave early.\n\nHaving a person specifically there to be on your side and run interference on any attempts that might come from well meaning nincompoops will be a great way to protect yourself.

I\u2019m so sorry that you have this in your life. By no means am I trying to belittle your feelings in this next statement- all families have their issues some worse than others. Your grandparents matter to you and vice versa. They are also parents to their son, that though has made terrible life choices, they still love too. Now you are faced with a very grown up decision to set aside your resentment of your father for one day for the love you have for your grandparents. You will not have them forever and you need to reconcile for yourself if giving them what they want for this one day is worth more to you than not ever seeing your father. I respect how difficult that is knowing that in the moment it will cause you pain but will it cause you pain in the future if you regret not going for your grandparents?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
