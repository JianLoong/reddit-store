He and my mom divorced when I was 5. My mom was his second wife. His first wife died about five years before my parents met. He had no kids with her but had wanted them. He never got over his first wife. She was always his one and only. But everyone was concerned about him and encouraged him to seek help and move forward with his life and his brother told him finding someone new to love would help. He met my mom and decided he would just pretend she was his first wife or something. Mom had some concerns but he told her all the right things and she was young (21) so she naively thought it was just how serious relationships go.\n\nWhen mom was pregnant with me she developed eclampsia and I had to be delivered by emergency c-section. On top of the seizures mom had a pretty major bleed. She didn't come around for a couple of weeks. In that time my father named me... after his late wife. Had all the paperwork submitted and everything while mom was sick. It was the beginning of the end for my parents even though mom stayed married to him for a few years after that.\n\nAfter the divorce my mom had primary custody and my father saw me every other weekend. He very clearly never wanted me. I hated being called his first wife's name, I hated how he would only talk about her. One day when I was 6 I told him he didn't love me he only loved her and he said that was right, that he loved her and only her and he never should have pretended he could ever love another woman or love children who were not born from her body. He said the only way he could tolerate me was by giving me her name.\n\nMy mom eventually helped me change my name, something that was complicated to do, but by then my father was no longer in my life.\n\nHis parents were and they were good to me. We are close. But now they are celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and they want me to attend while my estranged father will be there. I have not seen him or been around him for 10 years. I don't want that to change. They still want me there though and begged me. I told them I won't go since he'll be there but we can celebrate on our own before or after. My uncle said I should be there for them and I should give my father a chance, that maybe he's found a way to love me and want me in his life, that I should have compassion from him, he's all messed up, and even if he's a dick, my grandparents aren't.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681897603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rnmhs/aita_for_telling_my_grandparents_i_wont_go_to/", "score": 623, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your father had approached you separately wanting to make sincere amends, that would be one thing (though I don't personally think you should let him back in your life, even then).

Now you are faced with a very grown up decision to set aside your resentment of your father for one day for the love you have for your grandparents. You will not have them forever and you need to reconcile for yourself if giving them what they want for this one day is worth more to you than not ever seeing your father.

No celebration, invitation or event is worth your mental health", "NTA.\n\nIF for some reason you break down and go to the party, park so that you can't be trapped, and you can leave whenever you desire.", "Who cares if he\u2019s ready to step up and be a dad? Why would you ever trust him? Tell them sorry but you can\u2019t attend.", "NTA - ignore your uncle", "You did the right thing for yourself. No one gets to tell you differently. If your father wanted to mend anything he would not have waited 10 years for his parents to have an anniversary in order to do so. Live your best life and forget about that pathetic excuse for a father. You deserved better then and you deserve better now. NTA", "NTA. I haven't spoken to my own father in many years because he's a horrible human being, so I totally understand your reason for not wanting to be around him. I'm sure there was no malicious intent behind your grandparents' invitation, but they do need to respect your wishes. Like others have said, you can celebrate with them another day.", "I bet they're hoping that you'll reconcile with him at the party. They don't want people to know how awful he was to you and your mom; if you're not there, people will ask questions. They're not being good to you here. Your father was abusive to you and your mother. He's not sorry. If you go, he'll probably hurt you all over again by making snide comments about you or your mother. NTA", "NTA! That was very sweet of you to offer your grandparents an alternative option to celebrate, too.  We get to set our boundaries, for us.  How it affects everyone around us is really not our problem.  I take issue with Uncle chirping in as well.  It's like he's trying to sell your dad on you and your dad is a full grown adult and should take responsibility for his own dealings, actions, past and future relationships.", "NTA", "You know the thing that annoys me about these is that if the estranged person wanted to get in contact, they would.\n\nUsing an anniversary party to suggest a way to see estranged dad is so disingenuous and fucked up.  If he wanted to talk, he would.\n\nI'm sorry op, this sucks:(", "I think this is actually NAH, as far as you and your grandparents go. Your father and uncle can both suck an egg.\n\nYour grandparents just want to see all of their family together, in once place. And there is nothing wrong with that desire. There is something special about those occasions and it makes sense they'd want that for a big anniversary.  \n\nYou are also completely justified in not wanting to be around your dad. He dug his grave, he can rot in it.  \n\nAnd your uncle can stay clean the duck out of it. He has no place inserting himself in this situation, let alone trying to guilt you or suggest any intentions your father may have.\n\nAll that said, by avoiding family situations where he will attend, you're giving him some level of control over your life. If you were to go, and just ignore him, that would remove his ability to have any affect over your actions or choices.  \n\nYou can go to the celebration with clear boundaries that you will leave if he tries to converse with you. Treat him as if he's a plant on a Roomba, milling around the house. If the plant talks to you, leave. (I mean, I am not sure I'd stick around for talking plants anyway.) Give him no no more consideration than he deserves, which is absolutely none, at all.  \n\nObviously, not everyone gets to a place they can view this in this fashion. But it's been my experience that being able to be in the same room with my abuser, years after, and treating them as if they were less of a concern to me than the dust on my shoes was really empowering. My situation was a little different, I was SA'd when I was 18 by a friend. He later had a kid with someone close to me. He was out of the picture by the time I was around that person, but their kid was involved with a horrific accident at a young age and passed away. Avoiding my abuser wasn't worth the cost of missing the funeral. It was really healing, after all those years, to take back control like that.  \n\nSometimes life throws us situations like this. In your shoes, I would go to their party and have a great time. Enjoy the family time with those you love in the face of, and in spite of, the guy who could have had that if he had pulled his head out of his stink wrinkle instead of sitting around waiting for the world to cater to him.  \n\nBut I don't blame you, either, if you stick to your guns and refuse to go anyway.  If you don't go, though, you have to be ready for your grandparent's feelings to be hurt. They're just as entitled to feel how they feel as you are to feel how you do. So I'd at least be ready to help mend that afterwards.", "Maybe the grandparents aren't dicks, but they are specifically having OP's father at their shindig, and he is a dick.\n\nTherefore, due to both the commutative and the associative properties of dickitude ... grandparents might actually be dicks.\n\nGo with your plan of celebrating them separately, OP! NTA.", "Nta. They are asking you to hurt yourself for their comfort. The answer to that is always no.", "NTA. And tell your uncle to go to hell.", "NTA. And I'd ask them if they love you so much why do they want you to be around someone who actively caused you trauma. So much so that you associated your original name with someone not liking you", "NTA.\n\n\\> I told them I won't go since he'll be there but we can celebrate on our own before or after. \n\nI think it is very admirable that you presented this opportunity to them instead of a \"him or me\" ultimatum.", "NTA.  Your grandparents and uncle are probably trying to reunite you with your father at their special party, and everything will be rainbows and unicorns.  Don't go if you don't want to see your father.  He has made it clear to everyone who he is and how he feels.  Or, you could make an appearance at the party, and don't speak to your father.  Don't do anything you are uncomfortable with.  Your father is a grown man who made his choices, his parents and brother should leave it alone.", "NTA. Your dad was hideous, and I am sorry. \n\nIf you are able to go, it would probably mean a lot to your grandparents, and they are actual decent people who love you. You do not need to talk to your sperm donor. Your uncle was a complete idiot to suggest that. You can go and keep a dozen people between you and the jerks. You could go for a half hour. You could attend by Zoom or something. You do not have to talk to the waste of oxygen.", "Your uncle said your dad may have changed!  So your father has not shown any difference in his perspective about you, nor has he gone to the trouble of trying to approach you.  This may indicate that your grandparents and your uncle hope that you will do all  the work.  This happens too often in life where the wronged person is supposed to keep trying.  Your dad\u2019s relatives want a happy family and want you to make that happen. Otherwise they would be on him to take the initiative because he is the person who caused this.", "NTA for not going. Be gracious and don\u2019t act like you are trying to get them to uninvited him so you can come, just express your regrets that you won\u2019t be able to be there due to your father\u2019s relationship with you, and plan another time to celebrate them.", "My advice is go and ignore your sperm donor. Support your Grandparents like they always have you on this anniversary. They want you at this milestone and it will hurt them and maybe your relationship if you don't go. Make sure to set a hard set of rules about not wanting to be near or talk to your SD and if anyone tries to force you into contact you will be leaving. The decision is yours in the end but I don't want you to regret missing this day later. NTA.", "*With respect to everyone involved...a wedding is not the time nor the place for my father and I to have a forced reconnection that neither of us want.  I have well over a decade's worth of resentment built up in me for the way my mother and I were treated.  I have memories from my childhood where my father told me directly to my face, that he never loved me, never wanted me, and marrying my mom and having me was a mistake.  That he could never love a child that didn't come out of his first wife...and even naming me after his first wife was a mistake.  So even if I were in a place where I wanted to reconnect with my father, it would have to be under the supervision of a licensed therapist...not at a big party to celebrate Grandma and Grandpa's love for one another.*\n\n*I will not now, nor will I ever forgive my father for how he treated my mother and myself...and how he disrespected this family by abandoning his child like he did.  And I don't think dad is prepared for that reality.  I could see a world where we were cordial and respectful of one another, but I don't think he could ever truly accept that I will never forgive him.*\n\n*So it is with a heavy heart that I must decline my invitation to this celebration.  I am so grateful to everyone in my father's family for being there for me when my father wasn't.  I know I will never be able to repay that kindness.  But I also know that if the two of us were at the anniversary celebration, one of us would say something or do something that would ruin the evening for everyone.  And I just can't do that to Grandma and Grandpa.*\n\n*We don't always get what we want out of life.  Sometimes, we just have to accept that the way things are...are the way things are.  Please understand that this is just how things are between my father and me.  And if he wants that to change, he is going to have to prove that HE has changed and that HE is remorseful.  Only then will I even consider opening opening my heart again.*\n\nNTA", "NTA. Does he know your new name? I would probably go just to introduce myself to him using the new name.", "Info: Does your family (grandparents, uncle who is giving terrible advice, etc) know what he has said and how he's behaved towards you?", "Nta, it sounds like you grandparent's mean well, but they are being delusionally hopeful,  its obvious  that your father needs therapy and grief counseling, but WHAT THE FUCK, who says that to a little girl it's unforgivable you don't own him anything and you don't need him", "NTA. Don't go to the party, it's not up to you to fix your AH father", "NTA, but you are letting your father control your actions.  Don't let him control you having your best life.

He has done no such thing and deserves no compassion. He may be messed up but he is far worse than a dick. He stole your identity at a birth that could have killed your mother to honour a dead woman, and told you he could only tolerate you by doing that. He is downright evil and there is no evidence he has changed. It's said for your grandparents but their special occasion should not be marred by this. If they insist on him going, it's your duty to yourself and even them not to go. NTA in the slightest degree.", "This is my first thought.  Uncle train-wrecked two more lives.

Why's it the child's responsibility to mend the relationship with their parents when they've said shit like that to them?", "Especially since the uncle is the one who pressured OP's father into dating/marrying another woman when he was clearly not ready to move on and put them all in this situation to begin with.", "This is probably one of the same uncles that told her dad to find someone new to love to get over his first wife.
