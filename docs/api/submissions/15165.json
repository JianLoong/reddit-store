He never got over his first wife. She was always his one and only. But everyone was concerned about him and encouraged him to seek help and move forward with his life and his brother told him finding someone new to love would help. He met my mom and decided he would just pretend she was his first wife or something. Mom had some concerns but he told her all the right things and she was young (21) so she naively thought it was just how serious relationships go.\n\nWhen mom was pregnant with me she developed eclampsia and I had to be delivered by emergency c-section. On top of the seizures mom had a pretty major bleed. She didn't come around for a couple of weeks. In that time my father named me... after his late wife. Had all the paperwork submitted and everything while mom was sick. It was the beginning of the end for my parents even though mom stayed married to him for a few years after that.\n\nAfter the divorce my mom had primary custody and my father saw me every other weekend. He very clearly never wanted me. I hated being called his first wife's name, I hated how he would only talk about her. One day when I was 6 I told him he didn't love me he only loved her and he said that was right, that he loved her and only her and he never should have pretended he could ever love another woman or love children who were not born from her body. He said the only way he could tolerate me was by giving me her name.\n\nMy mom eventually helped me change my name, something that was complicated to do, but by then my father was no longer in my life.\n\nHis parents were and they were good to me. We are close. But now they are celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and they want me to attend while my estranged father will be there. I have not seen him or been around him for 10 years. I don't want that to change. They still want me there though and begged me. I told them I won't go since he'll be there but we can celebrate on our own before or after. My uncle said I should be there for them and I should give my father a chance, that maybe he's found a way to love me and want me in his life, that I should have compassion from him, he's all messed up, and even if he's a dick, my grandparents aren't.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681897603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rnmhs/aita_for_telling_my_grandparents_i_wont_go_to/", "score": 1930, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your father had approached you separately wanting to make sincere amends, that would be one thing (though I don't personally think you should let him back in your life, even then).

He was clearly actively harmful to you, and you are probably a million times better off without him.\n\nThat being said, this is a party for your grandparents, about your grandparents. You should make your decision about them, and go, but bring along a friend or partner to help you. Also, especially after you've made it so clear you don't want to be around him, if you go, even for a short time, that will mean a lot to them, since they'll know how much you are doing for them by coming. Also, you can always leave early.\n\nHaving a person specifically there to be on your side and run interference on any attempts that might come from well meaning nincompoops will be a great way to protect yourself.

I\u2019m so sorry that you have this in your life. By no means am I trying to belittle your feelings in this next statement- all families have their issues some worse than others. Your grandparents matter to you and vice versa. They are also parents to their son, that though has made terrible life choices, they still love too. Now you are faced with a very grown up decision to set aside your resentment of your father for one day for the love you have for your grandparents. You will not have them forever and you need to reconcile for yourself if giving them what they want for this one day is worth more to you than not ever seeing your father. I respect how difficult that is knowing that in the moment it will cause you pain but will it cause you pain in the future if you regret not going for your grandparents?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why would you ever trust him? Tell them sorry but you can\u2019t attend.", "NTA - ignore your uncle", "You did the right thing for yourself. No one gets to tell you differently. If your father wanted to mend anything he would not have waited 10 years for his parents to have an anniversary in order to do so. Live your best life and forget about that pathetic excuse for a father. You deserved better then and you deserve better now. NTA", "NTA. I haven't spoken to my own father in many years because he's a horrible human being, so I totally understand your reason for not wanting to be around him. I'm sure there was no malicious intent behind your grandparents' invitation, but they do need to respect your wishes. Like others have said, you can celebrate with them another day.", "I bet they're hoping that you'll reconcile with him at the party. They don't want people to know how awful he was to you and your mom; if you're not there, people will ask questions. They're not being good to you here.

That was very sweet of you to offer your grandparents an alternative option to celebrate, too.  We get to set our boundaries, for us.  How it affects everyone around us is really not our problem.  I take issue with Uncle chirping in as well.  It's like he's trying to sell your dad on you and your dad is a full grown adult and should take responsibility for his own dealings, actions, past and future relationships.", "NTA", "You know the thing that annoys me about these is that if the estranged person wanted to get in contact, they would.\n\nUsing an anniversary party to suggest a way to see estranged dad is so disingenuous and fucked up.  If he wanted to talk, he would.\n\nI'm sorry op, this sucks:(", "I think this is actually NAH, as far as you and your grandparents go. Your father and uncle can both suck an egg.\n\nYour grandparents just want to see all of their family together, in once place. And there is nothing wrong with that desire. There is something special about those occasions and it makes sense they'd want that for a big anniversary.  \n\nYou are also completely justified in not wanting to be around your dad. He dug his grave, he can rot in it.  \n\nAnd your uncle can stay clean the duck out of it. He has no place inserting himself in this situation, let alone trying to guilt you or suggest any intentions your father may have.\n\nAll that said, by avoiding family situations where he will attend, you're giving him some level of control over your life. If you were to go, and just ignore him, that would remove his ability to have any affect over your actions or choices.  \n\nYou can go to the celebration with clear boundaries that you will leave if he tries to converse with you. Treat him as if he's a plant on a Roomba, milling around the house. If the plant talks to you, leave. (I mean, I am not sure I'd stick around for talking plants anyway.) Give him no no more consideration than he deserves, which is absolutely none, at all.  \n\nObviously, not everyone gets to a place they can view this in this fashion. But it's been my experience that being able to be in the same room with my abuser, years after, and treating them as if they were less of a concern to me than the dust on my shoes was really empowering. My situation was a little different, I was SA'd when I was 18 by a friend. He later had a kid with someone close to me. He was out of the picture by the time I was around that person, but their kid was involved with a horrific accident at a young age and passed away. Avoiding my abuser wasn't worth the cost of missing the funeral. It was really healing, after all those years, to take back control like that.  \n\nSometimes life throws us situations like this. In your shoes, I would go to their party and have a great time. Enjoy the family time with those you love in the face of, and in spite of, the guy who could have had that if he had pulled his head out of his stink wrinkle instead of sitting around waiting for the world to cater to him.  \n\nBut I don't blame you, either, if you stick to your guns and refuse to go anyway.  If you don't go, though, you have to be ready for your grandparent's feelings to be hurt. They're just as entitled to feel how they feel as you are to feel how you do. So I'd at least be ready to help mend that afterwards.", "Maybe the grandparents aren't dicks, but they are specifically having OP's father at their shindig, and he is a dick.\n\nTherefore, due to both the commutative and the associative properties of dickitude ... grandparents might actually be dicks.\n\nGo with your plan of celebrating them separately, OP!

I have well over a decade's worth of resentment built up in me for the way my mother and I were treated.  I have memories from my childhood where my father told me directly to my face, that he never loved me, never wanted me, and marrying my mom and having me was a mistake.  That he could never love a child that didn't come out of his first wife...and even naming me after his first wife was a mistake.  So even if I were in a place where I wanted to reconnect with my father, it would have to be under the supervision of a licensed therapist...not at a big party to celebrate Grandma and Grandpa's love for one another.*\n\n*I will not now, nor will I ever forgive my father for how he treated my mother and myself...and how he disrespected this family by abandoning his child like he did.  And I don't think dad is prepared for that reality.  I could see a world where we were cordial and respectful of one another, but I don't think he could ever truly accept that I will never forgive him.*\n\n*So it is with a heavy heart that I must decline my invitation to this celebration.  I am so grateful to everyone in my father's family for being there for me when my father wasn't.  I know I will never be able to repay that kindness.

LET THAT DEADBEAT BE AND FIGHT YOUR UNCLE FOR OFFERING UNLESS ADVICE.", "NTA.\n\nAnd the party is a set-up, a trap, an ambush, or I miss my guess.", "LOL. He didn't win you over with \"maybe your father has found a way to love you\"? Huh.", "If you are still working on how you feel about the complete fool who hurt you then you don\u2019t have to go anywhere he\u2019ll be. Ever. But if you are finished with him, don\u2019t care what he thinks, and want nothing to do with him, this is an opportunity to be publicly and very finally shut of him. Go, laugh, celebrate, and have no idea how \u201cthat\u201d guy is anything to you at all. Treat him like a stranger, a guest of your grandparents whom you don\u2019t know and will likely never see again. \n\nOnly you know if this scenario would be empowering to you or not. But if you hadn\u2019t considered it- I figured you should examine it as an option.", "You know that neglect is abuse right? And that children **need** love and care to grow up well, neither of which her dna donor did. Also the difference with single parents home that turn out fine? Is that there wasn't another whole ass adult there that is their literal parent telling them they don't love them, never did and wish they had never been born told to their face at 6 yrs old. Thankfully ops mom saw the writing on the wall and divorced her husband\n\nThe kind of shit that ops dna donor did sticks with a person and frankly idc how much he was grieving, it's disgusting behaviour. If I were the grandparents in this situation, I'd be *pissed* that ever happenned to my grandchild and even more that my own son said it. I definitely wouldn't ask them to hang out together just cause I felt like it.\n\nAlso how is compromise a bad thing here, why is this the worst thing for you? Another day to celebrate her grandparent also means more celebration for them and it can be more intimate one on one. She can literally still be there for them.", "NTA.  On the day of the party, your GPs will be busy with guests and then worn out.  You won't be particularly missed.  Just have a private party before and don't worry about it.  Tigers don't change their stripes.  Why set yourself up for insult, Again?", "NTA\n\nCan we collectively stop telling the now-adult child who was mistreated by their caregiver to \"give them another chance?\" when the kid clearly doesn't want to?\n\nSeriously. Fuck that noise. They already had their chance, and these are the consequences.", "NTA. Damn dude, your dad is fucked up\n\nSkip the party, do something fun with your mum instead", "I hate it when anyone says\"You need to be the bigger person! Do it for the family! Just ignore it to keep the peace.\"\n\nNo, you need to take care of yourself. Go to the party or not but decide what's the best for you & don't let anyone pressure you otherwise.\n\nNTA", "NTA   It's sad that his parents have to suffer for his behavior.   You made a reasonable offer.   They should accept it.", "NTA.\n\nYou've made a clear boundary and that's a good thing. It's most unfortunate that your grandparents don't understand why you have such a firm boundary.", "Maybe I\u2019m a cynic, while I do believe people can grow, some people are just rotten in their core, dad shouldn\u2019t be given a chance or trusted to redeem himself", "'maybe he's found a way to love me...' \n\nWhat sort of f'ked up s\\* is that to tell anyone.", "It might be therapeutic to write him a letter putting all your feelings out there, how he negatively affected you and that while you never want to reconcile or have a relationship, that you want him to know how YOU are disgusted to have him as you father. It may help you bring some closure so you can move on.", "Right?! What OP\u2019s sperm donor said to get\u2014**A SIX YEAR OLD**\u2014was *child abuse.* OP, you are NTA.", "If you are close enough to your grandparents show your face, hug them, wish them congradulations, then get out. Only you can decide, but it will show how much you care about them and they are clearly important to you. Tell them you have a condition for attendance.\n\n Have your grandparents and uncle make it clear to your father,  that any atempt to approch you will result it your making a scene. You will air all his faults and dirty laundry out loud, ruin the party, and do what you can to embarass him . No quater. Its your condition for attending at all. He keeps his distance.\n\nReherse something like this, and tell uncle and grandparents that this is what you will say at the top of your lungs if he gets close\n\nGet away from me, I dont speak to dead beats. I dont speak to people who tell their 6 year old child they only tolerate them because of who they were named after. You are not welcome in my life, \n\nNTA", "I was told to forgive my mother because \"she found love when you were unloveable (as all children are sometimes)\" by my aunt...
