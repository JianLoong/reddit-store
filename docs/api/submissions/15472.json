We get on amicably - no hostility, no bad atmosphere, etc and I get time with my daughter when she comes round to stay at mine with me and my partner. \nMy partner, whilst she is fully aware and understands my situation with my ex and daughter why we stayed in touch, when we first got together she found it difficult and strange I was still involved (ie communicating) with my ex. My point of view is that we have a daughter together and for the sake of her upbringing it\u2019s best both parents are involved and at least can be in the same room to discuss matters (my parents divorced when I was ~10 and they cannot stand each other which is what I don\u2019t necessarily want my daughter to go through the same experience as me). My partner accepts this point of view after seeing how I interact with my ex putting to rest her doubt there might have still been a spark between us. That flame is long gone, not even napalm can reignite that spark\u2026\nSo, there has been situations in the past where my ex has messaged and asked if I can collect my daughter or take her to an appointment etc because for whatever reason she can\u2019t. If I don\u2019t have any plans or if I\u2019m available I would take her up on that offer but this is what irritates my partner. Her point of view is that why am I helping out their household?  It should be either my ex or her husband that should sort it rather than relying/reaching out to me seeing as it\u2019s their bad planning and it should be my ex\u2019s responsibility since my daughter lives with them (note - this might happen once every month or so, not a regular occurrence like it\u2019s happening every week).  My point of view is that I am helping for my daughter and considering I\u2019m available I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t because if I don\u2019t then my daughter misses out on classes, events, appointments etc plus I get to spend time with my daughter. \nTwo examples - my daughter had a music class in the afternoon which I was asked if I could take her. I was free so I said yes. On the day, when asked from my partner what my plans are I said I\u2019m picking my daughter up to take her to a music class because my ex was unavailable. My partner got irate and ranted why am I doing that as that\u2019s their problem?\nAnother example was I was asked if I could take my daughter to get her COVID jab as my ex was having issues with her daughter and the appointment was all booked.  Again, their issue but if I didn\u2019t take her my daughter wouldn\u2019t be able to get her COVID jab until another appointment was made\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand my partners point of view if I\u2019m being too involved in my ex\u2019s household whereas I see it as part of my parental duty, but I\u2019m not sure if there needs to be clearer boundaries with my ex in those responsibilities regarding our daughter?", "created_utc": 1682213606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vqvkt/aita_for_helping_out_my_ex_with_our_child/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To say that you\u2019re \u201chelping their household\u201d is ridiculous, she\u2019s your daughter and you\u2019re playing a parental role which includes things like picking your kids up. \n\nWhat you\u2019re doing is amazing because it means that she will get to have loving relationships with both parents without the trauma of trying to be their mediator because they \u201ccan\u2019t stand each other.\u201d You seem like a great guy, but your partner needs some perspective. You\u2019re being a responsible parent and they are being unreasonable. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s the right thing to do!", "NTA.   At all.  And yes, I think there need to be clearer boundaries.  Maybe something along the lines of, \"This is not about my ex. This is about my child.  I'm not going to give up any time with her because of your insecurities.  I won't ignore any plans you and I have made, except in an emergency.  You will always come before my ex - she's not even on the grid. But if I'm free and I can help my daughter out, I'm going to do that, because she's my responsibility too, and I love her.

Not only have you been demonstrating a positive parenting relationship with your ex to your partner for the duration of your relationship with partner- but your partner hasn\u2019t taken this opportunity to learn about this way of learning (for example if she knew only different parenting relationships, she\u2019s had time to learn what a positive one looks like.). And most seriously your partner is insisting you do things to spite your ex and disadvantage your daughter.   She\u2019s demanding that you act in a way that would cause issues, this is significant!  You need to look at this and deck whether this is a deal breaker for you.\n\nDon\u2019t have kids with her!!!  You can see what kind of co-parent she would be if your long term relationship doesn\u2019t work out.", "NTA, that's your kid and you ought to be as involved as possible. I find your partner incredibly strange and immature for feeling this way at all, never mind actually expressing anger about it. It sounds like your partner expects you to be less involved out of spite and doesn't care about the best interest of your child. This would be a deal breaker for me tbh.", ">my partner thinks I\u2019m too involved in their household\n\nNTA - It's your *daughter* you're involved in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My partner got irate and ranted\n\nFor your sake, I hope she's wonderful otherwise....", "NTA.    It's not like your ex wife asked you to pick up her dry cleaning or take her car to the mechanic .

Maybe some couples counseling to try and figure out if there is a deeper issue at play.", "NTA - You are helping your daughter. GF needs to understand parenting is not smooth even when multiple plans were secured. It appears your boundaries are fine. Your daughter is learning what a safe and consistent relationship is which will be a guiding principle when she selects a partner.\n\nYour girlfriend rants are not cool. You don't need the headache. I question if she cares for your daughter cause why would she not want her to be safe, get medical care..etc.  GF has a rigid co-parenting opinion.

It's your daughter. You are making sure your daughter knows that you still love her and are involved in her life. If it was your ex's daughter with her new husband, then your partner might have more of a point.

I think your partner is jealous of the time you spend with your daughter outside of your \"scheduled\" time with her.", "NTA. Your partner is strange to me bc it sounds like you put your daughter first and that\u2019s an amazing quality. If your ex took advantage I could understand but this doesn\u2019t sound like that. It\u2019s time to have a heart to heart with your partner.", "NTA. You have a functional co-parenting relationship, and are rightfully prioritizing your daughter's health, education, and happiness over rigid nitpicking of exactly who is responsible on what days. Your partner's attitude is concerning. She's dating someone with a child; she should understand that, while you have a parenting schedule, but you don't actually stop being a parent when it's not your day on the schedule. If you're happy with the balance of responsibility, and your kid's needs are met, then you're fine.", "There is nothing wrong with your boundaries.

It doesn't even sound like time alone with your ex, which--even if the spark weren't dead, as you mentioned--would have otherwise been the only justifiable reason for your gf to be upset.

I'd be curious to know how she treats your daughter when you're not around.", "NTA except how you word this to your GF. You aren\u2019t \u201chelping\u201d your ex. You are being a parent. Taking a child to appointments etc is part of parenting. You obviously understand this but they do not.

Whilst your daughter may (or may not) reside more with your ex, she is still your daughter and the fact that you can work together for YOUR DAUGHTERS LIFE to run more smoothly is how it should be, and by your own admission it isn\u2019t often. I would make sure that your daughter does not hear your partners opinion on this as she will take it to heart and it may damage your relationship with your daughter. \n\nIf this was me my answer to partner would be \u201cshe is my daughter and I will co-parent the best we can FOR my daughter. I will not change this and you can either happily accept it or leave. No one comes above my child or her happiness and security.\u201d", "She jealous that\u2019s your child it\u2019s is part of you and ex responsibility honestly it\u2019s none of her business what you do with your child", "Your daughter doesn't stop being your daughter on the days she sleeps at your exes. You're not only a parent on the days you have her at yours. \n\nCommunicating and picking up or taking your daughter places or doing stuff for her when your ex isn't available should be a matter of course every day of the year. \n\nYou're her dad every day of the year, she doesn't stop to exist the minute you drop her off at your exes and start to exist in your life again the minute you pick her back up on your days. \n\nNTA but I think you really really need to have a conversation with your partner. It's not okay that she sees your daughter like a burden and not a full part of your life including on days she's not with you. I think it's not okay that you're letting your partner speak about your daughter like that and involve herself in you taking care of your daughter like that, especially since she is demanding you don't care for her when she's not with you.\n\nYour child isn't \"their problem\", she's not anyone's problem, and it's not okay that your partner thinks you doing things for your child makes her a problem.", "NTA. Your partner is a dumbass sorry to say.", "NTA You\u2019re parenting your daughter. You can\u2019t do that without communicating with your ex. Your arrangements and relationship with your ex sound reasonable, fair and healthy. Your partner on the other hand sound unhinged. Taking her worthless, illogical argument at face value ANYTHING you do for your daughter counts as supporting your ex\u2019s household and the only solution is to cease all contact with both your ex and your daughter. The only boundary you need to clarify is telling your partner you don\u2019t want to see her anymore.", "NTA it takes a village,\n\nYou are being a good father ensuring your child gets everything they need\n\nHelping your ex also helps maintain a positive relationship between your families which can only benefit your child,\n\nI am assuming the mother would also be understanding and helpful if you ever had issues with your custody time?", "Change partner"]}
