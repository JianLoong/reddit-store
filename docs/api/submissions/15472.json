We get on amicably - no hostility, no bad atmosphere, etc and I get time with my daughter when she comes round to stay at mine with me and my partner. \nMy partner, whilst she is fully aware and understands my situation with my ex and daughter why we stayed in touch, when we first got together she found it difficult and strange I was still involved (ie communicating) with my ex. My point of view is that we have a daughter together and for the sake of her upbringing it\u2019s best both parents are involved and at least can be in the same room to discuss matters (my parents divorced when I was ~10 and they cannot stand each other which is what I don\u2019t necessarily want my daughter to go through the same experience as me). My partner accepts this point of view after seeing how I interact with my ex putting to rest her doubt there might have still been a spark between us. That flame is long gone, not even napalm can reignite that spark\u2026\nSo, there has been situations in the past where my ex has messaged and asked if I can collect my daughter or take her to an appointment etc because for whatever reason she can\u2019t. If I don\u2019t have any plans or if I\u2019m available I would take her up on that offer but this is what irritates my partner. Her point of view is that why am I helping out their household?  It should be either my ex or her husband that should sort it rather than relying/reaching out to me seeing as it\u2019s their bad planning and it should be my ex\u2019s responsibility since my daughter lives with them (note - this might happen once every month or so, not a regular occurrence like it\u2019s happening every week).  My point of view is that I am helping for my daughter and considering I\u2019m available I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t because if I don\u2019t then my daughter misses out on classes, events, appointments etc plus I get to spend time with my daughter. \nTwo examples - my daughter had a music class in the afternoon which I was asked if I could take her. I was free so I said yes. On the day, when asked from my partner what my plans are I said I\u2019m picking my daughter up to take her to a music class because my ex was unavailable. My partner got irate and ranted why am I doing that as that\u2019s their problem?\nAnother example was I was asked if I could take my daughter to get her COVID jab as my ex was having issues with her daughter and the appointment was all booked.  Again, their issue but if I didn\u2019t take her my daughter wouldn\u2019t be able to get her COVID jab until another appointment was made\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand my partners point of view if I\u2019m being too involved in my ex\u2019s household whereas I see it as part of my parental duty, but I\u2019m not sure if there needs to be clearer boundaries with my ex in those responsibilities regarding our daughter?", "created_utc": 1682213606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vqvkt/aita_for_helping_out_my_ex_with_our_child/", "score": 224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To say that you\u2019re \u201chelping their household\u201d is ridiculous, she\u2019s your daughter and you\u2019re playing a parental role which includes things like picking your kids up. \n\nWhat you\u2019re doing is amazing because it means that she will get to have loving relationships with both parents without the trauma of trying to be their mediator because they \u201ccan\u2019t stand each other.\u201d You seem like a great guy, but your partner needs some perspective. You\u2019re being a responsible parent and they are being unreasonable. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s the right thing to do!", "NTA.   At all.  And yes, I think there need to be clearer boundaries.  Maybe something along the lines of, \"This is not about my ex. This is about my child.  I'm not going to give up any time with her because of your insecurities.  I won't ignore any plans you and I have made, except in an emergency.  You will always come before my ex - she's not even on the grid. But if I'm free and I can help my daughter out, I'm going to do that, because she's my responsibility too, and I love her.

Not only have you been demonstrating a positive parenting relationship with your ex to your partner for the duration of your relationship with partner- but your partner hasn\u2019t taken this opportunity to learn about this way of learning (for example if she knew only different parenting relationships, she\u2019s had time to learn what a positive one looks like.). And most seriously your partner is insisting you do things to spite your ex and disadvantage your daughter.   She\u2019s demanding that you act in a way that would cause issues, this is significant!  You need to look at this and deck whether this is a deal breaker for you.\n\nDon\u2019t have kids with her!!!  You can see what kind of co-parent she would be if your long term relationship doesn\u2019t work out.", "NTA, that's your kid and you ought to be as involved as possible. I find your partner incredibly strange and immature for feeling this way at all, never mind actually expressing anger about it. It sounds like your partner expects you to be less involved out of spite and doesn't care about the best interest of your child. This would be a deal breaker for me tbh.", ">my partner thinks I\u2019m too involved in their household\n\nNTA - It's your *daughter* you're involved in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My partner got irate and ranted\n\nFor your sake, I hope she's wonderful otherwise....", "NTA.    It's not like your ex wife asked you to pick up her dry cleaning or take her car to the mechanic .

You are getting extra time with your daughter.", "NTA - annoys me more than \"weekend parents\" who pretend that they're not actually full-time parents. Your kid is your kid all the time and that's what you're living by. Good for you! If your partner doesn't get that, she needs to get over it. Maybe some couples counseling to try and figure out if there is a deeper issue at play.", "NTA - You are helping your daughter. GF needs to understand parenting is not smooth even when multiple plans were secured. It appears your boundaries are fine. Your daughter is learning what a safe and consistent relationship is which will be a guiding principle when she selects a partner.\n\nYour girlfriend rants are not cool. You don't need the headache. I question if she cares for your daughter cause why would she not want her to be safe, get medical care..etc.  GF has a rigid co-parenting opinion.

It's your daughter. You are making sure your daughter knows that you still love her and are involved in her life. If it was your ex's daughter with her new husband, then your partner might have more of a point. However, even then, there's nothing wrong with showing a child there is another adult who cares for them. I think your partner is jealous of the time you spend with your daughter outside of your \"scheduled\" time with her.", "NTA. Your partner is strange to me bc it sounds like you put your daughter first and that\u2019s an amazing quality. If your ex took advantage I could understand but this doesn\u2019t sound like that. It\u2019s time to have a heart to heart with your partner.", "NTA. You have a functional co-parenting relationship, and are rightfully prioritizing your daughter's health, education, and happiness over rigid nitpicking of exactly who is responsible on what days. Your partner's attitude is concerning. She's dating someone with a child; she should understand that, while you have a parenting schedule, but you don't actually stop being a parent when it's not your day on the schedule. If you're happy with the balance of responsibility, and your kid's needs are met, then you're fine.", "There is nothing wrong with your boundaries.

It doesn't even sound like time alone with your ex, which--even if the spark weren't dead, as you mentioned--would have otherwise been the only justifiable reason for your gf to be upset. If your gf can't handle you being their for your kid, she's not mature enough to be in a relationship with a responsible parent.", "  NTA.   Get rid of the jealous partner.

I'd be curious to know how she treats your daughter when you're not around.", "NTA except how you word this to your GF. You aren\u2019t \u201chelping\u201d your ex. You are being a parent. Taking a child to appointments etc is part of parenting. You obviously understand this but they do not. And honestly if your girlfriend can\u2019t understand this is how someone is a parent either her parents were MIA or she\u2019s just very insecure. Either way, next time say hey I\u2019m taking kiddo here or there. End of discussion. You\u2019re not helping your ex, you are helping your child and spending time with them.
