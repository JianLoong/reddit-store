You're giving a \"well technically\" answer here, which *may* work in a court of law, but will *never* make you not an asshole.\n\nThe kid only did it because you talked him into it.

With a big but...\n\n\nBut dad should also be questioned on why the son wasn't taken on the cruise as well.\n\nIf the son doesn't have a job then there's no excuse, so that's abandoning a minor who should have been sent to his mother's \n\nIf someone got into a car there's a huge liability issue compared to whenever he's 18 and could have taken the punishment as an adult.", "This seems like a more balanced response. I think the dad is more upset about his son drinking and smoking than the party. \n\nThat said what teenager doesn\u2019t know that their uptight parents do NOT want them to throw a party? He asked the more laid back parent for permission and then used it as an excuse. Small children figure out which parent is the pushover and use it to their advantage. I can\u2019t believe the father fell for that old ploy; especially since they are divorced! The correct response to that is \u201cmy house has different rules than your mom\u2019s house.
