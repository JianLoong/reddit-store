Tim and I have been friends since we were ten years old- neither of us have ever had feelings for each other beyond a brother sister relationship. We\u2019ve been through a lot together and will always be close. We speak or txt nearly daily and try to see each other as often as we can (we live several hours apart).

My husband was of course invited too. He said he would book us a hotel and I said we didn\u2019t need to because we can stay with Tim\u2019s family. This set him off yelling that he was sick of Tim being so involved in our lives. I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t really engage with his concerns.

You're married now, his feelings are valid. He deserves to be included in plans and conversations. I think he feels left out.", "YTA. I think it\u2019s partly the way this situation transpired.  You are taking an out of town trip to see Tim\u2019s mother on her birthday (which in and of itself your husband may think\u2026really?) , and your husband says ok I\u2019ll book the hotel.  You say no worries we\u2019re staying at their house.   \n\nEverything was planned without your husband\u2019s input or knowledge. He\u2019s tired of being dragged along as a side character in his own life.   You and Tim are the main characters doing and discussing everything that affects him.

Perhaps your friendship with Tim has changed and he isn't happy about it. Perhaps you choose Tim over your husband more than not and he's grown to resent it.\n\n10 years is a long time and people change, saying you knew this 10 years ago doesn't really cut here.", "It sounds like you get a healthy dose of your emotional support from the friend instead of developing it with your husband. \n\nYou have known your friend longer, and it's not encumbered with day to day family/house workings and sexual intimacy...so not entirely unexpected. \n\nYour knee jerk reaction that your husband always knew about the friend sets up an ultimatum between the two that never works out well. \n\nUnless you are leaving it out it sounds like your husband is putting in the work and love for the marriage. He is feeling like there is a third person in the marriage in which you only interact. \n\nWhen you are all together are you firmly with your husband or are you and the friend going into secretive glances/intimate knowledge zone, talking about things that exclude your husband? \n\nDon't think you are doing anything wrong necessarily, but if you want to remain married and happy you def need to address your husbands concerns and reflect on what you are seeking from him and the friend.", "While it was nice that you invited your husband to come along on you and Tim's vacation, behaviors and statements like this:\n\n\"I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t really engage with his concerns\"\n\n\"I told him he knew right from the start that Tim would be in my life and if he didn\u2019t like it he should have said something many years ago.\"\n\nWould probably lead the average spouse to believe that you're actively working to dissolve the marriage.\n\nCan't say if that's the case or not.

You should have respected that as he is your husband and spouse trumps best friend sorry. He gave you more than a reasonable resolution and you decided to just take a dump on it. He didn't try to stop your friendship, he didn't try to stop you from seeing said best friend. He wanted to book a hotel room for he and his wife.", "Info : How involved is Tim in your life ? Like phone calls everyday ? Or more like dinner once a week ?", "I get that you\u2019re protective of your relationship with Tim. \n\nHowever, YTA. It sounds like your husband just needs extra reassurance about your marriage. It doesn\u2019t seem like an actual issue with Tim as a person but more that something is missing from your relationship. If the husband always knows you\u2019ll pick him he shouldn\u2019t be jealous. \n\nYour husband might just be a jealous person, in which case, NTA.

Perhaps it's harmless. Perhaps it's too much. \n\nMy mom has a twin sister like this, they were best friends. My dad eventually got tired of it and complained about it. They moved to a different town. My aunt tried to kill herself. Mom took the kids and moved back.\n\nRegardless of who's the A, you guys need to talk. You need diplomacy.

That he might not feel he's as important as Tim is to you?\n\nI think it'd be good to apologise for disregarding his feelings, and trying to have an open dialogue about how he feels.", "YTA and it\u2019s not even close.  I understand you were up front with your husband about Tim from the start.  However, when you took your marriage vows, your marriage defaulted as THE MOST IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP in your life.  When your husband voiced his concern you brushed it off, strike one.  \n\nThen, you unilaterally decided on a trip with Tim, after your husband voiced his concern, and added, my husband was of course invited too, like he was an afterthought. Strike two.\n\nThen, when your husband graciously agreed to go and wanted to be a part of the planning and not be an afterthought you immediately shot him down and further doubled down on your disregard for his concerns about Tim by saying no need for a hotel we are staying at his house.  Strike three.\n\nHonestly I would cancel on Tim and take your husband on a trip just the two of you.  It might be time to step back a little from Tim and focus on your marriage.  If Tim was as good of a friend as you say he is he will be gracious and allow you to take some time to focus on your marriage.", "YTA but small AH for the hotel thing\u2026 I lean towards nobody is the AH here.  It\u2019s totally fine to have a platonic friendship with the opposite gender but\u2026 it\u2019s also okay for your husband to set healthy boundaries for that friendship.  It sounds like he was willing to compromise by going on the trip but tried to set an appropriate boundary so that he could feel more comfortable going on this trip and you just steamrolled right over his feelings there.  In reading your post, I also got the sense that your friend is more important to you than your husband.   It\u2019s very possible that your husband is getting that vibe as well which would make anybody insecure in their marriage.  Marriage counseling might be something to consider.", "YTA... I've been in. Similar situation. The problem with friends like this is that they take away from the relationship you have with your husband.\n\nRemember that there is limited time in a day or a week and if you are always making this friend your priority the naturally your husband isn't. In addition it will prevent you from truly bonding with him and you both working on your relationship together. Your marriage needs to come first that is the whole point of getting married, you made a commitment to put one another first.\n\nDoes that mean you need to stop bring friends with Tim (I hope that's his name because I can't see the original post) ... No. But you do need to evolve your relationship with him into something sustainable that works well with your marriage and right now this isn't working well.", "Info - Would you be OK if he had a female best friend and was as close to her as you are to Tim, communicated every day with her, wanted to travel out of town with them and stay at her house etc?   \nWhat is the plan going forward when your relationship with Tim has a negative impact on your relationship with your husband?", "Is Tim married? If so, what does s/he think about your relationship?\n\nNo one is saying give up your friendship with Tim. You two have to realize, though, that the relationship should have changed when you or he got married. You need to give more time and attention to your spouse as he should be your priority now. You spend a lot of time each week talking to Tim- is this time that you could be spending with your husband? Tim is your friend- why would you two need to stay with Tim's family when you visit, no matter how close you are? You can be friends but there should be a boundary now that you are married, the same boundary that Tim should have if he is in a serious relationship. You are treating your husband like a third wheel in the OP and Tim story and it's not fair. Your first commitment is to your husband now and not Tim anymore.", "Your husband must have been under the impression that he was marrying his wife - not his wife, and Tim. Four years of another person completely dominating the time and attention of your spouse sounds incredibly exhausting, and it's come to a head with how he's reacted to your running roughshod over his feelings with - surprise, Tim! - being placed on a pedestal.\n\nIt's time for therapy and boundaries to be set. Tentatively YTA, not for having a friend, but for letting them get in the way of your marriage.", "YTA. Keep putting Tim or anyone above your husband and see.", "YTA.

I see either of them once every other year or so. \nMy husband comes first though. I share my life with him. I talk to him the most, spend time with him the most, everything. \n\nI think you mean well, but it sounds a lot like you keep Tim at the same level as your husband, and that doesn\u2019t create a healthy marriage.\nYour husband should be your ultimate best friend. \nHe\u2019s asking you for some boundaries (I.e. getting a hotel instead of staying with Tim\u2019s family) and you dismissed it without question. \n\nMaybe listen to how your husband is feeling, and , oh I dunno, act like you care.", "YTA because it seems as though your husband is feeling insecure about the marriage and you\u2019re not doing anything to address his feelings or concerns. You have a very close and initiate relationship with another person\u2014do you have that same intimacy with your husband? Do you go to your husband when you need support? Or do you go to Tim? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your husband felt like he was second place to Tim rather than you and your husband being a unit. \n\nYou\u2019re n t a for being friends with Tim, but it\u2019s unproductive and rude to dismiss your husband\u2019s feelings. You have a relationship and history that your husband isn\u2019t a part of, and that\u2019s very isolating. Especially with staying at Tim\u2019s house\u2014they\u2019re family to YOU, but your husband may likely feel like even more of an outsider to \u201cTim and my wife\u2019s happy family get together\u201d", "YTA but not for being friends with Tim.  It\u2019s for how you are dismissing your husband\u2019s feelings.  There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with a married woman being friends with a man, but there has to be boundaries.  Staying with Tim\u2019s family with your husband is crossing that boundary. You should have let your husband book a hotel. Also, you should have talked about this better when your husband brought up his concerns before.", "INFO: Do you spend more time and are more connected with Tim than your husband?  Are you closer with Tim?  Have you given your husband reason to feel that he's the third wheel in all this?", "YTA - if Tim is your best friend it stands to reason that you occasionally confide in him. Often people confide their frustrations to their best friend, including frustrations with their partners. He may have assumed that to be true even if it isn't.\n\nIf that were the case, over 10 years Tim would come to represent the man in your life who knows all the bad stuff about your husband... That can be increasingly uncomfortable to deal with.", "YTA. I consider myself a fairly liberal and open minded guy. But no this would not fly in my marriage, and I think if the tables were turned and he had the \u201clong plutonic female friend\u201d who is taking time away from him and his family, it would be totally unacceptable. Famous people in similar situations include we will call them Bob and Jane Bates. Mr. Bates had a long established female friend that he maintained a strong plutonic relationship with after  marriage. It was disclosed to Mrs. Bates before their marriage and it was agreed that this friendship could continue after marriage. I read that this was one of many mitigating circumstances as to why Mrs. Bates filed for divorce.", "NTA but you need to have a real talk here. Tim being your bestie is one thing but dismissing your husband's concerns or just that he feels like #2 to Tim is a big deal.\n\nTen years in, he can't expect your rel with Tim to change - but he can expect your rel with him to change. He should not be \"finding out\" about plans you've made entirely without him.\n\nMainly if he wants to stay in a hotel, you should. Just bc they are like family to you, they aren't to him, and he needs to be comfortable too.", "You can feel whatever you feel about you not engaging with his feelings.  Lesson learned and you cannot go back in time.\n\nNow all this have come to a head and you two may benefit from couples counseling.\n\nI wonder if something changed with your husband a couple of months ago when he first started making comments.

Also, were you getting your own room/bathroom? \n\nFurther, it sounds like you were going regardless of whether your husband could come too or not and his comfort/plans were an after thought.

Tim\u2019s family has always been my family. So much so that I lived with them my last year of high school when my parents moved away from my home town. \n\nMy husband has always known this and never had a problem until recently. A couple of months ago he started making comments about how often Tim and I talk, that it\u2019s weird and we need to stop. I don\u2019t know if this is something he had thought for a while but to me it came completely out of the blue. \n\nIt eventually came to a head yesterday when I said I wanted to go back to my hometown with Tim for his mum\u2019s birthday. My husband was of course invited too. He said he would book us a hotel and I said we didn\u2019t need to because we can stay with Tim\u2019s family. This set him off yelling that he was sick of Tim being so involved in our lives. I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t really engage with his concerns. I told him he knew right from the start that Tim would be in my life and if he didn\u2019t like it he should have said something many years ago. \n\nHe\u2019s still not talking to me and now I\u2019m feeling guilty that I might be an ahole for not engaging with his feelings.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That way you still get to visit but have your own space and privacy, and maybe even some time to have a meal or do some sightseeing etc with just the two of you.\n\nStaying at Tim's family's house means 100% of the weekend is taken up with seeing him and his family. \n\nIf your husband is an introvert this prospect would be especially exhausting.\n\nI don't think YTA on purpose, but you do need to consider your husband more.", "It is possible for men and women to have a platonic relationship.

He offered to book a hotel which I would take as supportive agreement to come, you informed him that there is no need to spend the money as you are both welcome to stay at Tim's family home. Again, I don't see how this is making plans without him, it is simply informing him that you have free accommodations available, which he may not have had reason to know until you said it. He reacted by going off the rails and that is 100% on him.\n\nIf your husband wants to get a hotel because he isn't as close with Tim's extended family and needs a way to step away from a large social gathering with people he doesn't know, that's legitimate and he can calmly use his big boy words and ask for it. But yelling that he's sick of Tim being so involved in your lives is uncalled for and you're absolutely right - this is your family, blood or not, and if he has a problem with that the time to speak was way before now.\n\nNow, I see a lot of people saying that this might be a culmination of many times that your husband feels put on the back burner to Tim, and that could be possible. I tend to think that there are valid and invalid reasons for that, example, blowing off a date because your brother is in the hospital versus blowing off a date because your brother wants to eat ice cream after a breakup. But if there are active, objective ways that you have put your marriage on the back burner for Tim, then the correct way for him to address them is a request for marriage counseling.

The poor dude is being dragged around \u201cTim this, Tim that\u201d and his life is being controlled by a person he very clearly does not like.\n\nEverything in this post and comment section screams Tim is #1 and hubby is #2.", "Question is would you say the same if Tim\u2019s mom was OP\u2019s biological mom and Tim was her biological brother? Because it\u2019s one thing if OP and Tim were friends who flirt etc growing up but then decided being a couple was too weird. It\u2019s another thing when they never had that type of relationship, when they have always acted like siblings, when OP lived in their home, when Tim\u2019s parents were her guardians her senior year, and when for all intents in purposes her husband has an issue with her staying at her mom\u2019s house because he thinks she and her brother are too close. Framed like that\u2026", "Seriously. Every time I see people all worked up about these things, I wonder what are bisexual people supposed to do...??? Should we just have no friends at all?", "I made this into a separate post OP but you are married now and you both made a commitment to one another. You don't need to give up Tim as a friend but you do need to evolve your relationship with him into something that is compatible with your marriage. \n\nYou may not think it, but usually close friends (regardless of sex) prevent a married couple from getting closer. It may be working for you but your husband may want that time with you or to find opportunities to get closer.\n\nHaving gone through the couples therapy in this with my wife I can say that it's hard because it will involve setting boundaries for yourself and tim. Your husband tried to do this with the hotel, saying that he still wanted time with you privately and some space from Tim and His family. That's very reasonable and a way for you all to make this work.", "Bullshit you\u2019d be ok with it. Your husband has given you multiple indicators he isnt comfortable with the situation and instead of considering WHY you just do your own thing with tim. Its ok to have best friends, but your husband is looking to be your best friend and you are telling him to go fly a kite. So he feels threatened l, understandably so", "Don't listen to the incels. It's fine having a close male friend.", "Close friends is fine, healthy even - the danger is when close friends start replacing parts of the relationship.  Say jack and jill are in a relationship but jill starts outsourcing some of her emotional needs to john.  Everything looks fine because jill & john have a perfectly platonic relationship - but they've taken an important part of the jack & jill's relationship away.\n\nThis creates a lot of hidden problems because it removes a lot of balance from the relationship.  You're supposed to have two people meeting each others needs, both giving and taking and keeping a balance.  If one person receives what they need from outside the relationship, then within the relationship they're always giving and never taking, and it's destabilising - they feel balanced but the relationship doesn't.\n\nYou end up with something called \"emotional cheating\", which as just as damaging to relationships as physical cheating - but happens entirely invisibly because no-one's doing anything actually 'wrong', and very often they'll never be able to quite put their finger on what went wrong.", ">Melodic\n\nYou do realize that a quarter or a third is not a majority, right? Statement; men have been trained to accept shitty behavior: retort: butwhatabiutism BUT 1/3 of women are abused, and plenty of men can\u2019t cook, so the previous statement about men is invalid. This is pure whataboutism, full stop.", "It's unusual though,  because he hasn't been upset about it for the majority of their, so boundaries weren't set, and then he suddenly has an issue. \n\nI also don't think staying at a friend's house is weird at all. There is a communication breakdown sure, but I dont think that makes the OP the villain here aside appears to be as much on the husband who suddenly out of nowhere has an issue (something must have happened). \n\nThey need to talk it through.", "No. He wants to change the nature of the friendship though.", "The hotel wasn't because Tim was a friend it was because staying at Tim's mom's house is **Free**", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/soph_lurk_2018 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uade9/aita_for_telling_my_husband_my_best_friend_is/j7b213u/\n\nBot Reported.", "They tolerated it before.

Me seeing my family and close friends was never a problem for him and vice versa. I would never have tolerated it being that way. We shouldn\u2019t stop being our own people or have to jettison other important relationships just because we get married. \n\nThis isn\u2019t something that impacts both of them. It\u2019s not a major financial decision or a decision about their future. There\u2019s no reason whatsoever for him to freak out about it. It\u2019s creepy and controlling. And you know he\u2019s only acting like this because her bff is the opposite gender.\n\nETA: If the husband is part of the \u201cus\u201d that\u2019s going on the trip, it does impact him and he should have a say.", "If it was just some friend\u2019s home I could understand, but she lived there for a year in high school.

OP may not be a villain but completely dismissing her husband's feelings and then basically telling him to deal with it is a great way to begin down the path of resentment and divorce.", "Really? Did you see anything about the husband trying to limit the mount of time they communicate? Did you see anything where the husband says she can\u2019t be friends? Pro tip: when you get married, almost all of your relationships have to change. It\u2019s called being an adult. It\u2019s called being in a loving and committed relationship where you put your partner first. otheriwse, you should not be married in the first place.", "It makes op and her husband family no. 1.

What ends up happening is that new couples will only end up doing the work part and if she is spending her free/fun time with her friend then there is no free / fun time for her husband.\n\nFrom experience let me tell you how this goes. You both work all day, do stuff around the home, take care of kids or pets as and at night maybe you want to get intimate or do something go fun with your wife and she's laying in bed texting someone else(doesn't matter who), disengaged from you. Now on occasion this is totally fine and healthy but when it's an every day thing it's a bit much.\n\nWhen you are just dating it sort of doesn't matter, because you don't do half of the stuff married couples do like making bigger finance decisions or talking about kids. Dealing with family members.... Etc.", "I stay at friends parents places all the time. They are like family to her. \nResentment and divorce would be because the husband wants to exert some sort of control nothing more. This is about control. Likely jealousy.
