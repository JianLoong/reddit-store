I have a son and a daughter, both married with kids. They and their spouses help out with the celebration planning but I take care of the food mostly.\n\nEverybody seems to be on an agreement except for the desserts. Now for dessserts I had made a specific list of what to serve. Together with my older granddaughters (18) & (16) we're going to prepare a cranberry cake and White Chocolate-Dipped Madeleines and Blondies. It all started when my son told me that my younger granddaughter 'Jenny' (10) wanted to bring cake pops to the gathering and asked if I could add this to my dessert list. I bluntly said I was sorry but it wouldn't work because, like I said the dessert list is very specific. and also, Cake pops don't really seem to be properly going with all the other elaborated dessert options on the list. He said that it's not a big deal and that he was sure the guests will love the cake pops as much as the other desserts, and that it'd mean so much for her. I said I was sorry and afford that maybe she bring those cake pops to a family birthday party. He got upset and talked about how I'm letting my other granddaughters participate while excluding Jenny. I said that my two older granddaughters participate under my supervision. he offered that Jenny bakes the cake pops under my supervision but I said I don't have the time for that. Also, my older granddaughters have more experience and techniques but Jenny is still a child learning. I'm not discouraging her from her passion, I just don't feel like what she makes is considered ready to be put on the menu since we have lots of relatives who are hard to please. He argued that I was prioritizing the guests feeling over my own granddaughter's but I assured him that it's not true. He left and hasn't been responding to my phonecalls.\n\n\nI just found that he told his dad this morning that he's contemplating not attending christmas with us this year which I thought was unnecesary and unreasonable. But I could use some unbiased opinion on this.", "created_utc": 1670766550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zisp6c/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_let_my_granddaughter/", "score": 4281, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Um - chocolate dipped Madeline\u2019s - ok: cake pops are one step more fancy then those by having the serving stick included. Dipped - check, moist cakey inside - Check. First you have to make the Cake. Then mould the Balls & put on sticks. Then make the dipping and dip them. It\u2019s more work then the Madeline\u2019s even. \n\nThere are bakeries and businesses that solely do fancy cake pops. You are crushing her creativity and passion for sharing food.

My grandfather on one side died when I was a toddler, my grandmother on that side was *amazing*. She did everything herself - was a tough old farmhand who grew and processed her own food, including meat, until she got to retirement age. Even then she baked, cooked, canned, knitted, sewed, crocheted, gardened, that woman was a powerhouse of knowledge. She was also an infinite font of love and encouragement. She taught us how to do the things she did but never discouraged or shamed us for our poor efforts when we were kids. She let us help as much or as little as we wanted, and she played with us and took us places and while I lost her in my mid-teens, my memories now, in my middle age, are still powerfully full of the love she showed us every single day. I remember vividly her voice, her hugs, every room of her home filled to the brim with good food and happy times.  My heart still has a hole in it that aches, gently, for all the additional years I wish I'd gotten with her.\n\nThen there were my other grandparents. The \"you\" grandparents. Visits to them were the *worst*. Sit still on the couch. Don't put your feet up. Stop wriggling. Pay attention. Don't touch that! Don't run in the house! Don't play with those! Don't make such loud noises! They wanted dressed up little performing dolls, and any of the grandkids who couldn't abide by the many, many rules of the house suffered their bad moods and snapping tones the entire visit, and the parents would hear about it after. They didn't share or teach anything with us.  None of us were ever invited over. Not that any of us *wanted* to go over.  They were simply grouchy old strangers related by blood.  They died much later.  I don't have any memories of them that aren't don't/stop/sit/stay/behave.\n\nYTA. A beautiful little 10 year old soul is excited to share in and contribute to your traditions.  With all the joy and sweetness of a young child learning their way around experimentation in the kitchen, she wants to share that joy and sweetness with you on a day you both find special.  And your response is to have such high standards for your traditions that only children who are old enough and docile enough to accept you as a general in the kitchen may contribute.  I hope you enjoy being the grandparent nobody likes but just cater to in order to avoid family drama.  The grandparent that more and more family members get sick of having to cater to rather than being invited into a warm and loving home that wants them there just as they are, and slowly drift off and form attachments with other friends and family at other, happier gatherings.  I truly hope you enjoy it.  Because it's likely to get a lot lonelier and a lot quieter before you're done.  You'll be left with those too meek to stand up to you, and the meek are rarely interesting conversationalists, and the sly who will hover around you in the hopes they'll be in your will.", "Yta.
