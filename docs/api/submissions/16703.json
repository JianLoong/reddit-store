It's made worse, imo because you've already explained your position to him and the message he's sending is that he doesn't care. \n\nThis, to me, is about boundaries; you've said pretty clearly that you don't want him to use your bathroom and yet he has, even when he's been very sick and could have passed onto you whatever bug he had which is inconsiderate.\n\nI would sit down with him and explain your point of view again and ask whether he is capable of respecting your wishes. If he's not, or makes a joke of it, frankly I'd be questioning his character because if it's this now... what might it be in future?", "NTA, but a cardboard cutout won't solve your problems. \n\nI have a question for you. Could you trade bathrooms with him? With your bathroom being the closest to the bedrooms, and the other being downstairs, I feel like it's a bit normal/natural for him to use the one by the bedrooms first thing in the morning or last thing in the evening. Perhaps if you took the out-of-the-way bathroom, it would cease to be a problem.", "NTA.   \nBuy a door lock. Or replace the door with one that has a lock.", "NTA: This isn't a trivial request. It's an indication of how much he respect you, which from this post, is very little. You've asked him numerous times and he doesn't listen. He leaves your bathroom a mess.\n\nGet a lock and put it on the door. Think about how he treats you otherwise. Does he listen to you? Does he respect you?", "NTA- the solution you\u2019ve come up with is hilarious, pls update us", "The cardboard cutout will work exactly one time. \nTalking through it and trying to agree on something that works for BOTH of you (switch bathrooms, perhaps?) might be a more permanent solution.", "NTA but you need to seat him down again, explain that you need your space, and if he doesn't listen I would just put a lock on my bathroom tbh\nEdit: that might lead to the end of your relationship though, but in my view, respecting the other person's boundaries is a basic  prerequisite for a relationship anyway.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s disrespecting you. He thinks his minor convenience is more important than your clearly stated feelings on this issue.\n\nRecalculate the rent split based on your other roommate having 1 bathroom, your boyfriend having 1.5 bathrooms and you having 0.5.

I don't blame you for being upset, but jump-scares won't help. He came and interfered with you being able to use his washroom after you found he was using yours. That tells me that this isn't about the bathrooms, it's about him preventing you from being able to have boundaries that he'll respect. \n\nAre there other lines he crosses, after you've asked him not to do it? Nothing that seems, in the moment, like a big enough issue that you can justify leaving him over it, but things that upset you and he *knows* upset you...and he does it anyways. I bet there are. I bet there are at least three things coming up in your mind right now.\n\nI'm going to let you in on a secret: you don't need a big dramatic reason to leave. It's enough to be unhappy with how things are. It's enough to not want this to continue.\n\nYou don't have to break up, of course. You can choose to stay. But if you imagine life with him in a year, five years, ten years...do you see any realistic chances that he'll change? Is this something you can endure indefinitely?", "Info:  Are the bedrooms upstairs?  So when he was sick, he'd have to go up and down the stairs?  In the middle of the night, he'd have to go up and down stairs to pee?", "YTA\n\nYou pay equal shares of the rent, but you\u2019ve decided that the bathroom that is much better is solely yours. Of course you\u2019re the arsehole. \n\nYou can\u2019t pay equal rent and then deny him both a bathroom that\u2019s close to the bedrooms and the only bidet. Not to mention that if you have guests, I bet it\u2019s \u2018his\u2019 bathroom that they use. The reason he needs to shower in his bathroom is because that is where his stuff is; you\u2019ve created the problem and you\u2019re trying to blame him for it. \n\nYou\u2019re being kinda selfish and immature. People share bathrooms. Either grow up and accept that people share bathrooms, or swap bathrooms so that you have the worse one, since you\u2019re the one with the problem.", "Personally I think you\u2019re very unreasonable. Most people don\u2019t have a problem sharing with a partner. This was something you should have been in absolute agreement with before moving in together. Your complaints while he was sick is also temporarily unreasonable because he was sick. If you\u2019re so worried about germs, why in the world would you even have a partner then? Partners are going to be exposed to the others germs. The only way to avoid that is never having a partner. Obviously once you know you\u2019re sick you don\u2019t intentionally get really close to the other person if avoidable but not in general every day life. Good luck with your bathroom situation!", "NTA for wanting your boyfriend to use his own bathroom when he has the option to. \n\n\nHowever, YWBTA if you placed a cardboard cutout in your bathroom to scare people because that could be seriously dangerous.

You could seriously injure someone. And it's only going to work once anyway, so it's a massive waste of time and completely petty. \n\nIf having your own bathroom is so important, and he's constantly using yours, just swap bathrooms.", "NTA for wanting your own space. My spouse and I have separate bathrooms and it\u2019s great. But that\u2019s where you lose me.\n\nA cardboard cut-out? First of all, that\u2019s only going to work once. Otherwise its only other functions would be to collect mildew and be an obstruction. The problem-solving skills if a 8-year-old Macaulay Culkin will not work for you here, and it\u2019s frankly ridiculous that you think they would. It\u2019s time to think like an adult.\n\nSpeak to him again about how much having your own bathroom means to you, and how disrespected you feel when he leaves it in a mess or prevents you from using it. \n\nTry helping him update his bathroom so that he feels more comfortable there. Gift him with a bidet attachment for his toilet and some cool decor. Speak to the landlord about his hot water situation.\n\nBut you also need to ask yourself what this means for you and your relationship long-term. This is clearly the most convenient bathroom, and you\u2019ve claimed it for yourself. Is this fair or sustainable? If this is just about having your own space, would making a permanent swap make you happy so that he has the better bathroom? If not, why not? Also, being in a relationship means dealing with your partner\u2019s habits, little messes and germs. Nobody likes it and good partners will try to limit it as much as they can, but that\u2019s the reality of a relationship. You don\u2019t seem ready for that. If you want to be with this person your living situation may not always involve separate bathrooms. \n\nThis whole thing feels like you may have some growing up to do.", "YWBTA talk like adults.

Passive agressive scare tactics will only lead to more arguments.", "NTA, that is hilarious!", "Info: Why don't you just switch if convenience is more important to him and having your own space is more important to you?\n\nNTA for him violating your bathroom. But YWBTA if you buy a cardboard cutout to scare him instead of finding a more adult solution lol. If you do switch and he continues to use your bathroom - clearly at that point making it about him wanting to control you rather than be lazy - then you may have to rethink the relationship.", "NTA. He's disrespecting you. Putting a lock on the door isn't hard. You can order a keyed doorknob online. Watch a youtube video. Buy a screwdriver.
