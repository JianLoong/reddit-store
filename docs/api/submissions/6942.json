My (64F) granddaughter (14F) has been referring to Katy for the past 18 months or so. Her mum, (Annie, 32F) passed away 10 years ago. We have remained close with David for the children. It hurts to hear her refer to another woman as her mum as it feels like that everyone is just forgetting that Annie existed. It already feels a little like David is replacing Annie with Katy as they have a similar look.\n\nChristmas is always hard, Annie passed away in the week leading up to Christmas and her birthday is at the start of January. This year we had David, Katy, my three grandchildren and Katy\u2019s daughter at ours for Christmas. My granddaughter was very excitedly talking about a dance competition that Katy was taking to her in the new year. As she was talking, she kept referring to Katy as her mum and I ended up excusing myself because I felt that I was getting upset as it should have been Annie doing these things with her, not Katy. Later on after dinner, my granddaughter found me upstairs looking at pictures of Annie. She asked me if everything was ok, as she knew I was upset. I told her that Christmas just makes me a little sad. She replied that I should talk with mum because Christmas also makes her upset \u2013 Katy\u2019s mum died when she was young, on Christmas I believe. I snapped at her and told her that Katy wasn\u2019t her mum and she should stop referring to her as such as it is disrespectful to her actual mum, Annie. I know I crossed a line snapping at her, but Katy isn\u2019t her mum. David, Katy and all 4 kids left not long after I snapped at her.\n\nDavid has since called me to say that the kids won\u2019t be coming around for their weekly dinner for a while as they need space. My granddaughter isn\u2019t talking to me at all. My husband thinks I was an idiot for snapping as I should be happy that our grandchildren have a mother figure and that Katy was willing to work at forming such close bonds with all of them.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1673312658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107w24u/aita_for_telling_my_granddaughter_to_stop/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not the only one to lose her, however, and after 10 years, life is moving forward.  It does not erase your daughter from their lives and memories, but your granddaughter is allowed to choose a mother figure for herself, and if Katy loves her and treats her like a daughter, far be it from you to take that away from either of them.  It sounds like you'd rather they all wallow in grief for the rest of their days.  Ask yourself - would Annie want that?  Would she want her daughter to feel lost and adrift without a mom?  As gently as I can say - YTA.  Please consider therapy to help with these misplaced feelings of betrayal.", "YTA - Your husband is exactly right. You also should see a therapist about processing your grief as it does not sound like youve really done that. I am sorry to say this, but Annie is dead\u2026 statements like \u201cit should have been Annie doing things with her, not Katy\u201d are concerning.", "Yta and it sounds like you\u2019re taking your grief and anger out on katy. I\u2019m sure all of them would want annie at all events but reality is katy is the one that will be involved. If calling katy mum is healing for your granddaughter you shouldn\u2019t take that away from her.\n\nSorry for your loss though I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through but maybe get some help, if it\u2019s been 10 years it\u2019s concerning you\u2019re so aggravated by your SIL having a new gf", "YTA (soft)\n\nI know you are in pain but Katy is the only person who gets to decide what role her stepmother plays in her life.", "Soft YTA.\n\nI know you are hurt and you feel like your daughter is being replaced.  But this isn't about you and you need to consider your grand daughters feelings.\n\nYou should be happy that Katy is such a positive influence in your grand daughter's life that she feels comfortable calling her mum.  \n\nYou need to apologize to Katy and your grand daughter face to face.  Explain that you got caught up in the moment due to the time of the season and you answered out of sadness.  Let Katy know that she is a welcomed part of the family and let your grand daughter know you respect her feelings.  If you don't do this you will lose your grand daughter.", "I am sorry for your loss,  to outlive your child is one of the most painful things any person can endure and you have my profound sympathy. \n\nBut\n\nIn this,  YTA.\n\nYou cannot demand that your grandchildren keep their stepmother at arms length or dictate their feelings about her. You are so caught up in your grief that you have forgotten to be happy that your grandchildren have a woman in their lives that they love,  respect and trust and who apparently returns that affection.  David seems to have mourned Annie's passing for a more than respectful and respectable time before reentering the dating world and I am going to presume that he was seeing Katie for at least a couple of months before making her part of the children's lives, so he's been seeing her for 2 years, give or take,  which is a very sensible duration for a courtship. \n\nNobody is \"replacing\" Annie but you cannot expect anyone to grieve forever....and would Annie have wanted David to stay single? For her daughter to have no woman to talk to about all of the things that a girl doesn't usually want to discuss with her dad? To miss out on dance competitions,  shopping trips and all the other \"mom & me\" stuff because she can't do those things with Annie?", "> It hurts to hear her refer to another woman as her mum as it feels like that everyone is just forgetting that Annie existed.\n\nShe was a little kid when her mom died.Tell her your feelings and apologize for letting them get the better of you.", "YTA. I totally understand why you feel as you do, but nothing good can come from you telling your granddaughter this, much less snapping at her about it. You can't control the relationships other people develop, and the only outcome of conflict like this is you losing contact with your grandchildren. By all means feel your feelings, but suck it up and apologise to your granddaughter.", "This is unfortunate all around.  You've suffered a terrible loss and you're grieving.  Everyone grieves differently and it's clear you're hurting.  You can't hurt your remaining family too tho.  Is tough enough without taking it out on your loved ones.  Granddaughter isn't erasing or replacing what she had, she's acknowledging the love shes been shown.  You should maybe acknowledge that love too", "YTA \n\n\u201cI \u201cKNOW\u201d I crossed a line snapping at her\u2026\u201d.  YOU KNOW YOU ARE THE AH. Just from that line alone. No reason you give can justify your behavior. You emotionally abused her. \n\nYour issues with not being able to let go of your daughter and move on is not anyone\u2019s problem but yours. You have no right projecting your grief and disappointment onto to others.  Period. \n\nAnd he\u2019s more. Your daughter is gone. Their marriage was over upon death. David is allowed to move on from the relationship with Annie and the past with her, and find peace with it. He\u2019s allowed to find someone else and be remarried and have a new family with her.  Annie is not coming back and he\u2019s not betraying her. She\u2019s in the past. Not forgotten just no longer present. \n\nYour granddaughter is also allowed to put Annie in the past. She\u2019s allowed to move on, make peace with her bio mom\u2019s death and be happy in the present. She\u2019s allowed to build a relationship with her dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and her future step mom.  That absolutely does not mean she is replacing her dead mother. It means she\u2019s allowing space in for another mother.  And just because Katy isn\u2019t her bio mom, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not your granddaughter\u2019s mom. It means she\u2019s a mom in the ways that matter, with love, caring for, support, all the things that make a parent a good parent. So yes, Katy is her mom if she wants to be and your grand daughter says she is. You do not get to decide that or what their relationship is. Only they do. \n\nYou\u2019re a jerk for trying to stop her and deny her from having a healthy relationship with a good mother figure when her own bio mom is not alive to be one.  It\u2019s in your granddaughter\u2019s best interest to get along with her step mother and it\u2019s also in her best interest to have a mother figure that can help her navigate through life, especially when female matters are involved. \n\nI seriously suggest you seek therapy, You\u2019ve had a decade to deal with your grief and to accept that Annie is gone. You\u2019ve had years to prepare for this situation to occur. And at least 18 months at a minimum of Katy being around to adjust to it. You have no excuse for being so rude and disrespectful. \n\n\nYou also need to apologize to David, Katy and especially your granddaughter, and most importantly respect their decisions and lifestyle choices. It\u2019s not your place to interfere and you will lose them if you don\u2019t get your grief under control and get an attitude adjustment. Because you will lose them and Not just for the short term either. You don\u2019t have any rights to your grand children, and alienating their father and step mother and over stepping boundaries and trying to control them will push them all away. Not to mention shaming your granddaughter like that and emotionally abusing her with guilt trips and emotional distress and manipulation is inappropriate and unfair. She won\u2019t want you around either.", "Yta\n\nWithout pause.\n\n It's awful that your daughter passed, but do you want your granddaughter going her whole life with this huge chunk missing out of her?\n\nEven if she calls Katy mom and does mother daughter things... your daughter still exists in her.  \n\nDo you want your daughter to be a loving memory/comfort for your granddaughter or a source of pain", "YTA\n\nLook, this can't be easy for you and your husband, or David, for that matter. Your granddaughter was 4 when Annie passed away. How much does she actually remember from that age? How long has Katy been in her life? Is it only 18 months that she's referred to her as \"mom\" or 18 months since they've known each other. You have every right to be sad and  feel what you feel, but don't take it out on your 14 year old granddaughter who has found someone she can have this beautiful bond with. Annie will never be replaced, but Katy can provide your granddaughter with the love I'm sure Annie would have wanted her to have.\n\nEdited for spelling.", "YTA\n\nYes, Annie is your granddaughter's mum, but she's been dead for 10 years. She died before Annie started school. That's sad, but Annie will have few memories of her.\n\nYou're still grieving your daughter. I'm sorry about that, but don't take it out on your granddaughter. She's a teenage girl, and Katy is the adult woman in her life. Calling Katy \"mum\" doesn't dishonour or diminish Annie's memory.\n\nLots of people call more than one person \"mum\". I call my mother-in-law \"mum\". It's OK.", "YTA.\n\nKaty being her mum now doesn't erase Annie having been her mum. She's had two mums! That's fine!\n\nYou are prioritizing the memory of your daughter over the living, breathing humans in your life.", "YTA.\n\nYou could've asked her why she does call the girlfriend mum. Or opened communication about her biological mother and talked about her and how they are alike etc.\n\nInstead you went nuclear on a little girl who has someone she trusts as a mother figure. Not everyone who loses their mother finds someone like that. She's not gonna have to go thru major milestones alone she'll have that mother figure she wants and needs. She has someone she trusts so if shit goes down she has someone to catch her.\n\nShes not erasing her mother's memory. She's finding ways to survive without her mother. And she's doing it a helluva lot healthier than I ever did.\n\nI was 15 when mum died. I spiraled. Hard. Still recovering from it. Your granddaughter has a chance of not going down a similar path than I did. She has a chance of having a healthy happy high school life and not getting with the first guy who says \"I love you\" because she's not desperate to feel loved and wanted. She deserves that chance of growing up healthy and happy. And if the girlfriend gives her that chance? You best stay out of the way.\n\nYou hurt your granddaughter because she dared to open her heart to another mother figure. Because she dared to open her heart instead of sealing it shut.\n\nYou need to apologize, get grief counseling and do better. Because you'll likely lose that relationship soon if you don't make changes.\n\nI'm glad that sweet little girl is on a different path after losing her mother than I was. Because she deserves every chance in the world to be able to move on and not wallow in grief. And not need intensive therapy to make it each week. And not having to take off an entire day of work to avoid the date her mother died by  being stupid or impaired (alcohol or weed. It's legal and I'm nearly 30) or just sleeping all-day in a depressive state.\n\nYou need to do better. So that little girl doesn't fall off the healthy path she's on. So she has the support she deserves.\n\nDo better. Stop the toxic cycle you are creating. Apologize to them all and yes including the girlfriend.", "YTA, only if nothing else after all this time you don\u2019t read this as a cry that you need therapy or professional help in dealing with these issues.", "YTA. She is 14 and apparently forging a healthy connection with this woman and it is her choice not yours how she addresses her.\n\nYou need to get some grief counseling instead of lashing out. I am sorry you lost your daughter but this girl lost somebody as well and she is trying to live her life.", "YTA:  and you know you are. But what makes you the biggest AH is that this happened on Christmas and seems like since that day you have not approached your granddaughter to apologize and say how wrong you were.", "YTA, for snapping at your grandchild\n\nYou were an adult when you lost your adult child. \n\nShe was a very small child when she lost her mother. \n\nYou're actually begrudging your granddaughter that another woman has made the effort to bond with her and take on the role of her mother. \n\nI'm sure you are heartbroken over losing your daughter, but your going to lose your granddaughter as well if you can't respect her relationship with her soon-to-be step-mother.\n\nSounds like David and Katy are doing a great job at blending their two families. Be helpful and supportive in their efforts, otherwise you may find yourself out of their lives permanently.", "YTA.  I'm sorry your daughter died, it's been 10 years, your granddaughter has a mother figure in her life. She isn't trying to be rude or disrespectful to you.", "YTA\n\n\nShe's old enough to choose what she wants to call her. Also, it really isn't your place. And you're going to harm your relationship with your granddaughter if you keep this up.", "I'm very sorry for your loss, but I don't feel like you have the right to tell your granddaughter what she should call her stepmother. I think what you should be concerned about is that her stepmother is a good person and that they have a good relationship. I think that's what your daughter would have wanted. I don't think anything good can come of you telling your granddaughter what to do in this instance. I can see it causing her to resent you potentially.", "Yta it hurts I know. But the kid is literally that. A kid. She needs a mom and deserves one. And if stepmom has earned that title then embrace that.", "I understand how incredibly difficult and painful this must be for you. You are watching Katie do all the things you should be watching your daughter do. It\u2019s not fair.  But, it\u2019s not your granddaughter\u2019s fault. \n\nYour daughter is gone. Nothing will change that. Despite that, your daughter is still important and she is still loved both by you AND your granddaughter.  You can\u2019t dictate to others how they grieve, how they cope, who they love, how they live their lives without your daughter, or how they choose to honor her memory. \n\nYou need to apologize to your granddaughter. Soft YTA.", "Yes yta major one at that", "YTA... I'm sorry you lost your daughter. This situation isn't like they got divorced and he's moving on. He lost his friend,  wife,  and they lost their mother.  Katy seems amazing to be able to want to be in their lives and to take on the role of a mother.  Last is not your daughter,  but she could be your friend. She is a connecting point to your grandchildren. You should apologize to your granddaughter and maybe reach out to have lunch with Katy to get to know this amazing woman that is influencing your daughter's children. It's been 10 years. Katy lost her own mother. There are times when God puts people in our lives to make the painful bits more bearable. Be open to adding love. Annie will always be present in your grandchildren's smiles,  laughter,  and hugs.", "> it should have been Annie doing these things with her, not Katy.\n\nYou\u2019re right. \n\nBut, you told a girl who lost her mom that she isn\u2019t allowed to have anyone in a maternal role? I know your hurting, but you\u2019ll never be able to take those words back. Please apologize. \n\nIt\u2019s well within the fathers rights to cut off contact. It would be a asshole move, but so is what you did..", "YTA. Sorry but Katy is her mom. GD was 4 when Annie died so most likely she doesnt even remember her that much. She lost one mother, why would you want her to lose another? Sounds selfish", "YTA\n\nSo granddaughter was 4 years old when her bio mom passed away and you are mad she has accepted Katy as her mother figure? Selfish,people can have 2 mother figures.", "YTA - I'm sorry for your loss, but you don't get to dictate the relationship between your granddaughter and her soon-to-be stepmother.", "she was 4 when her mom died.  at 14 she is probably so happy to have someone in her life that she loves enough to call mom.  i am sorry you lost your daughter, but katy is the child who wants this person in her life.  be a bigger person here, you can grieve your daughter without punishing your granddaughter because for loving someone new.  yta", "YTA. i know it's sad, but people MUST move on and live their lives. It's not a sign of disrespect to Annie, because if Annie were still here there'd be no reason for it. But this child is finding a mother figure after losing her own mom, and YOU are ruining that FOR YOUR GRANDCHILD.", "YTA.\n\nHow dare you. How DARE you. Your grief doesn\u2019t get to overshadow your granddaughters healing. Sure you lost a kid and that sucks when you outlive your kid, who was supposed to outlive you. But she lost her MOTHER, and you should be thanking god that your son in law met a person willing to step up to the mother plate and did it so well and with so much grace that your granddaughter feels safe enough to call her mom. It\u2019s been ten years, work through your shit and never project it onto your granddaughter again.\n\nEdit to add: and you\u2019re even more of an asshole for your views towards those in recovery from addiction. Work through your shit before you ever see them again.", "YTA. you dont get to decide who your granddaughter calls \"mum.\" this girlfriend is taking care of her, looking after her, is going to her dance recitals, making sure she is safe, everything a mother should do. You should be *happy* that your granddaughter has someone in her life who loves her as much as your daughter did.", "I understand how much it must hurt, but Annie has been ten years dead. Your granddaughter needs to be able to call her stepmother mum, it doesn't negate that Annie gave birth to her and was her mum when she was tiny. Gentle YTA.", "YTA, because you are the adult, and you considered your needs and not your granddaughter's. Did it occur to you that she might need this? That she might feel it's wonderful to have a new woman in her life?\n\nIt's not okay to direct a child to accept another adult as a parent. But it is okay to allow a child to make that choice for herself.\n\nYou made her feel guilty for something that she shouldn't have to feel guilty for.", "Yta \n\nYou do not get to decide what your granddaughter calls her dad's girlfriend.", "YTA: You are making YOUR grief a child's problem. She was 4 when your daughter passed and whatever grief and recovery she has will be very different then yours. I think you really need to look into grief counseling bc if your behavior continues it could destroy not only a little girl's happiness and psychological health but your relationship with her. Not to mention the guilt you are putting on your former son in law, his new wife and your granddaughter.", "If you want your grandkids back you will have to apologize to the whole family, when our love ones leave us, the pain they leave behind is great, but life goes on, and your husband is right, you should be glad her step mom treats them well.", "YTA\n \nYour granddaughter was only 4 when her mother passed. She now has something that had been missing for the past 10 years, a mom, & you want to take that away from her?", "YTA. What your granddaughter calls the important people in her life is between her, her dad, and Katy. You do not get to dictate that.\n\nYou are in pain, and I\u2019m sorry for that. The grief you feel having lost a child is unimaginable. Lashing out at her children is only damaging the living relationships you have. \n\nBe glad that your grandchildren have love in their lives. Keeping some wall between Katy and your grandchildren will not bring Annie back. Maintaining a loving relationship with them will keep her memory alive.", "Gentle YTA. It\u2019s great that you still have a relationship with your granddaughter, but you don\u2019t get to parent or dictate their life. Unfortunately your daughter passed away when your granddaughter was only 4. It\u2019s tragic and sad, but honestly Katy is filling the mum roll for her now. Would you have preferred David and your granddaughter have a permanent hole in their lives like you do? \n\nI\u2019d really encourage you to go to grief counseling because it\u2019s not healthy for you to be stuck like you are", "YTA.  It sounds like you are way more bent on celebrating the legacy of your daughter than your granddaughter and her family being happy.  Sounds pretty selfish to me.", "YTA. I am not going to pretend I imagine what it feels like to lose a daughter, and I am sorry for your loss. But what about the others in this situation? Your son-in-law lost his wife and your grand-daughter lost her mother. You aren't the only one who lost someone precious.\n\nAnd should your granddaughter not have someone else ever to love her like her mother did? And can she not feel that this is a \"new\" mother? Not replacing your daughter at all but another mom? You have jeopardized your relationship with your grand-daughter and if your daughter was able to speak with you, what do you think she would say? That she supports you snapping and caring that her daughter calls Katy mom? Or that she wants you and her daughter to remember her but let Katy be the mom that her daughter needs now.", "YTA - Their relationship has nothing to do with you. You are out of line imposing your opinion about it without being asked.", "Wow, huge YTA", "YTA. That isn't your call and she isn't your child.", "YTA.\n\nKaty has, indeed stepped into the role of \"mum\" for your granddaughter that Annie literally cannot fulfill. Calling Katy \"mum\" is not being disrespectful to Annie in the slightest. \n\nMuch as you feel Annie should be the one who does all the *mum* things, it's simply not possible. Katy is not an interloper, she's doing a great job of being who your granddaughter needs.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are trying to drive a ghost-shaped wedge between Katy and your granddaughter. You are actively doing harm, even if you don't mean to and are acting out of unresolved grief.", "As much as I feel for you - no parent should have to bury their child, even if they were grown - you overstepped here. You do not get to dictate how your granddaughter views the people in her life. If Katy has become a mother figure, and the children are okay with it, then she's \"mum\". While Annie will never be forgotten, everyone is moving on what their lives, and you have to allow them to do so.

Telling this poor girl she's wrong for calling her mother figure mum, after loosing her mum at such a young age, is disgusting behaviour on your part.\n\nYou were acting from a place of pain, and I hope you're able to recognize that, apologize, and be forgiven. But you need to realize how awful it was of you to put your own grief onto a child, and punish her for doing something completely normal and healthy.

Whether she views Katy as her mum or not is not for you to decide, much less \u201csnap\u201d at her about. She lost her mum when she was four - are you really expecting her to never have a mother figure in her life again, in order to spare your feelings? You lost your child, but you\u2019re forgetting you\u2019re not the only one who lost her.

However, YTA.\n\nYour granddaughter was 4 when Annie died. She likely doesn't remember her much. And, yes, that isn't fair. But the death of a parent with young children never is. Your granddaughter now has a mother figure after a decade of only having a hole where her mother once stood. Painful as it is, that isn't a bad thing.\n\nYou can still grieve your daughter and work with her kids and your husband to keep her memory alive, without shaming your grandkids for having a new mum.

Maybe you need to step away and get used to the fact your grandchildren are growing healthy well adjusted and are able to deal with their dad being able to function to give them a whole family again.\n\nThe only important thing you need to consider: your grandkids are thriving the way their mom would have wanted.

My (64F) granddaughter (14F) has been referring to Katy for the past 18 months or so. Her mum, (Annie, 32F) passed away 10 years ago. We have remained close with David for the children. It hurts to hear her refer to another woman as her mum as it feels like that everyone is just forgetting that Annie existed. It already feels a little like David is replacing Annie with Katy as they have a similar look.\n\nChristmas is always hard, Annie passed away in the week leading up to Christmas and her birthday is at the start of January. This year we had David, Katy, my three grandchildren and Katy\u2019s daughter at ours for Christmas. My granddaughter was very excitedly talking about a dance competition that Katy was taking to her in the new year. As she was talking, she kept referring to Katy as her mum and I ended up excusing myself because I felt that I was getting upset as it should have been Annie doing these things with her, not Katy. Later on after dinner, my granddaughter found me upstairs looking at pictures of Annie. She asked me if everything was ok, as she knew I was upset. I told her that Christmas just makes me a little sad. She replied that I should talk with mum because Christmas also makes her upset \u2013 Katy\u2019s mum died when she was young, on Christmas I believe. I snapped at her and told her that Katy wasn\u2019t her mum and she should stop referring to her as such as it is disrespectful to her actual mum, Annie. I know I crossed a line snapping at her, but Katy isn\u2019t her mum. David, Katy and all 4 kids left not long after I snapped at her.\n\nDavid has since called me to say that the kids won\u2019t be coming around for their weekly dinner for a while as they need space. My granddaughter isn\u2019t talking to me at all. My husband thinks I was an idiot for snapping as I should be happy that our grandchildren have a mother figure and that Katy was willing to work at forming such close bonds with all of them.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA - I understand you loved your daughter but don\u2019t you love your grandchildren too? Isn\u2019t it better for them to have a loving parent? It sucks but your grandchildren are alive you should be thinking of their best interest. You can be upset that\u2019s completely normal but don\u2019t take it out on the kids.", "I think you already know YTA. Having a mother figure that loves her can only benefit your granddaughter. I think you also know that, but it hurts that it's not your daughter. That's understandable, but you need to deal with that one on your own, rather than making it your granddaughter's problem. I think this is a situation that's perfect for therapy, where you can examine all of your emotions without judgment.", "YTA.", "YTA. \nIt hard for to lose a child, but don\u2019t let your own grief control over your granddaughter. \n\nShe is not wrong to want a mother figure in her life, it might hurt she calls Katie mom. \n\nBut to be fair, Annie have been dead since your granddaughter was 4. There for likely your granddaughter don\u2019t remember her that much.", "YTA. I'm sorry for your loss, but if you expect everyone around you to stop living and just mourn for your daughter, that is unfair and cruel. Is this what your daughter would have wanted? For you to get angry at your family for moving on?\n\nGrief is real and unavoidable, and I don't want to judge your grief. However, when your grief is hurting those you love ten years later, it has become counterproductive. Life is meant to be lived. Your grief does honor to your love for your daughter, but don't let it chase your granddaughter away.", "YTA\n\nI understand you're still grieving at the loss of your daughter, but why would you try to deny your grandkids something good?", "YTA. I can't imagine losing a child and watching the world move on, especially her children. Regardless it's not your place to put your feelings on a child, who's just trying to be happy. Everybody grieves their own way and moves on in their own way. I hope you find some peace.", "I'm not going to pass judgment. I can imagine that even  after 10 years the hurt and grief are especially fresh this time of year. And I know watching some other woman do all these things with your granddaughter is bitter because you, as her mother, wanted to see your daughter do all these things with her daughter.\n\nYou have a lifetime of memories of your daughter, but your granddaughter was 4 when she died and her memories are vague. You knew Anne best. Is she the kind of person who would want her family to stay frozen in time? Or would she hope that her child has found someone to love her, maybe not the same, but loves her and cares about her?\n\nYou let your grief take over, and that's what it does, it comes out sideways. Apologize for losing your cool, acknowledge the happiness that Katy has brought to the family. And believe that while Anne would wish she was there with all of you, she would be happy that they found love and happiness, even if she couldn't be there. And she would hope the same for you.", "YTA \n\nbut seriously, how do you think Annie would feel about all this? Wouldn't she want her family to move on with someone that's loving and cares for them? As a mother myself I'd certainly want them to move on and be happy.", "YTA. Your granddaughter gets to decide who she calls mum. I have a friend who\u2019s mom died when she was 18, and she calls her dad\u2019s new wife mom. It\u2019s an arrangement between the kids and their stepmom, no one else.", "YTA\n\nFor reference my sister passed away and left young children behind. So I get how tricky this is emotionally. But the thing is. This isn\u2019t about you or a lack of respect to their biological mother. \n\nIt\u2019s about the kids and the relationships they form with those around them. Kids, especially young girls need a mother, be thankful they have found someone loving and kind that can fill that role for them that they actually enjoy (as it sounds from what you\u2019re said) being around. Worry less about titles and more that your grandchildren have people they love who love them back.", "Yes YTA. A gentle YTA because I can't imagine the pain of losing a child. Unfortunately that is your cross to bear. Clearly they have processed and moved on from your daughters death more than you have. Which is a good thing. \n\nThink about what your daughter would think. Do you really think she would want her own daughter to grow up without a mother figure, just to 'honor' her memory?", "YTA. You should be grateful that she has a mother figure who loves her. Sorry but you don\u2019t get to decide what she calls her. Seems like you need to work through some things with a good therapist.", "YTA", "Sorry, but YTA.\n\nLoving katy doesn't diminish their love for annie. Find a grief support group if you're able.", "I'm really sorry for your loss but were you expecting your SIL to stay single forever?\n\nHim moving on doesn't mean he's forgotten Annie but they are allowed to be happy.\n\nI think you need counselling. \n\nYTA", "I want to start by saying I can\u2019t begin to imagine the pain you must feel at losing your daughter or the heartbreak hearing your grandchild refer to another woman as mum. Losing someone so young is always unfair to everyone and imagining all the things your daughter is missing while watching another woman share these experiences with your grandchild must be painful. \n\nThe fact that your son in law has maintained such a close relationship with your family while he has also had to face this same grief is something that can\u2019t be overlooked. I would imagine if you thought of what your daughter would want for her child it would be love. Someone to take care of her and treat her as their own. Someone your granddaughter can look up to and share a bond with. Your granddaughter calling Katie mum and being so offended by your comments should really show you that she has found that relationship.\n\nI\u2019m hesitant to make a judgment on such a painful situation but I have to go with a very soft and apologetic YTA. Your grief has clouded your perception of Katie and it sounds like she is a wonderful person to put herself in what must be an awkward situation in order to maintain relationships with ALL of your granddaughters family. \n\nPlease consider apologizing and expressing your grief in a more constructive way. I\u2019m sure your granddaughter would love to see pictures of her mother and hear stories about her growing up but you must remember it\u2019s ok for her to love them both. That\u2019s the thing about love, giving it to one person doesn\u2019t leave less for anyone else.", "YTA. Your granddaughter is a child that lost her mother, and she is healing. Your strike at her was spiteful and immature. She is the last person you should be sniping at. I understand you are in pain, and the loss of a child is terrible, but you will lose your relationships with your grandchildren if you react like this.", "YTA. I am really, really sorry that you lost your daughter, I can't imagine that kind of grief. But Katy has chosen to step up to the plate and be the mom that your granddaughter needs right now. This does not diminish Annie in any way. You need to apologize to your granddaughter right now and if you are contrite enough, they may forgive you for being so thoughtless and hurtful. Please, please get therapy", "YTA. You should be delighted that your granddaughter has a mother figure in her life again but you're selfishly stuck in your own grief. Your daughter's life ended TEN YEARS AGO and you want to stick a pin in her husband and children's lives and stop them at that point, too.  Well, now you see what that will get you - no family left at all, instead of just no daughter.  You owe them a groveling apology, AND you owe them a promise to get therapy, because after ten years if you're still sensitive enough to lash out at other people - children no less! - you. need. HELP.\n\nAnd yes, I saw your nasty little insinuations about Katy being a recovering addict.  Key word, recovering.  It's not your business as long as the kids are safe and happy, WHICH THEY ARE according to your own words!  So back off and leave it alone, because this is another point you're going to end up obsessing over and snapping at someone about, and will cause more rifts between you and that family.", "I understand where it's coming from and I'm very sorry for your loss. That being said you are the AH and your granddaughter's feelings and her healing should be more important to you.", "YTA. Your granddaughter deserves to have someone who loves her, since your daughter is gone. If you keep this up, you will alienate David and lose all the people you claim to love. Get over yourself.", "SOFT YTA. Your GD was so little when her mother passed and probably needs a mother figure. Please do not take it personally. I know you will grieve forever over this, but they need to move on. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "Soft YTA. Your grief and all the feelings that come with it are valid. But there's more than one way of becoming a mother, and to your granddaughter, Katy is her mum. She probably has little to no memory of her mother/ your daughter. That's sad, but it's also reality.  What you said was extremely hurtful to your granddaughter and the whole family. Apologize and try to support her relationship with Katy rather than being jealous on your daughter's behalf.", "Yta and I think you know it. They are not betraying Annie's memory. It's okay for granddaughter to have 2 mums and for Katy to be acknowledged as one of them. You need to apologize unreservedly to everyone and find a grief therapist to help you address your feelings.", "I don\u2019t have judgment for you, but I want to share something that was told to me a long time ago. \n\nSometimes the hardest thing about losing your loved one is your life stands still while everyone else moves on. \n\nI hope you find peace and comfort, but most of all I hope you make amends with your granddaughter.", "Your granddaughter was 3 or 4 when her mom died. I\u2019m sorry for your loss but to her your daughter is a picture and fuzzy memories that are more memories of things other people said than real memories. Katy is there and clearly loves your grandkids. Work on your grief but let the kids have someone who loves them and is alive. Being mean to your grandkids is just going to alienate them. They get to pick their mom. Sorry but they do. YTA", "Your granddaughter was 4 when her mom passed away. And you are right to feel emotional that you feel she is being replaced. But look at how wonderful for your granddaughter to have a woman who she feels loves her so much that she wants to call her \"mom\".\nYour daughter will never be replaced, and your grandchildren will always have a piece of her in them.", "Oh, you\u2019re one of *those* grandparents. YTA.", "You lost your daughter, that's a terrible experience for a parent.  It's understandable you don't want her forgotten or replaced.\n\nWith that said, your grand daughter has embraced a positive female role model in her life and that's a good thing.  It isn't a competition and the hole left by your daughter isn't meant to be filled by this woman you barely know, that's not her job and I don't sense she's trying to do that for you, but for others they grieve and move on differently and from your grand daughters perspective she gets memories that otherwise would have been taken from her as well.\n\nI'd encourage you to reach out and apologize and just relate that aspects of missing your daughter are still a challenge but that you want to stay close with your grand kids.  Don't see this woman as your daughters replacement.  Be grateful you can all share in loving your granddaughters.", "Yta and sorry but going forward you\u2019re probably going to see a lot less of those grandkids", "YTA", "YTA. I really am sorry that you had to bury your daughter; that's not how it's supposed to be. But you're also an adult and you must know on some level that it is not okay to guilt your young granddaughter instead of dealing with your own feelings. Get therapy now before you hurt your granddaughter even more, or before her father decides you're not going to get another chance to hurt her.", "YTA and your husband is right. It's completely understandable that you miss your daughter and I can't imagine what it felt like to lose her and it would be hard watching abither woman be her mother but think of your daughter and how much she loved your granddaughter, she would be happy to have someone love her child the way she would have if she could have been here. Life can be cruel but that woman has put in the effort and time to build a relationship with the kids and they absolutely adore her, that's a positive thing and although I feel for you, you don't have any right to tell her who she can and can't call mother and her being happy and accepting her as her mum is absolutely not disrespecting your daughter.", "YTA. Not many in-laws do as good a job at staying connected with the family of their deceased spouse, especially a decade after the loss. You've messed up something really special by not accepting Katy.", "I don't think you're the AH, but I do think you acted poorly.\n\nYou seem like a wonderful and loving mother who misses her daughter. So I'm assuming your daughter would be a wonderful and loving mother too. \n\nSo I ask you what do you think Annie would do? Would she want you all to live in a state of grief forever? Would she want her child to never feel a mother's love?\n\nIt seems like your granddaughter is a lovely and caring young lady, and it seems like Katy is a loving mother to her. Your son in law seems like he has done a fantastic job raising his daughter. So why wouldn't you want them to feel like a whole family? \n\nI'm sorry for your loss, I truly am, but I honestly think you owe your family an apology because you will not only be missing out on a daughter but also a whole family. A family who loves you and still includes you in their lives. \n\nI really hope that you see what you've got before you lose it forever", "I hesitate to say YTA, but you are in the wrong here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cannot imagine being in your shoes, having lost your daughter.  A parent outliving their child is just plain the wrong order of things.  Yet it does happen, and I'm very sorry it happened to you.  You have my deepest sympathy.  But life goes on, and life is for the living.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour granddaughter lost her mum when she was four and likely remembers very little about her, if anything.  I'm sorry to tell you that, but it's true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDavid is correct that your granddaughter needs a mother figure.  It sounds like Katy is willing to be that person, which - if you try to take a step back and look at the situation objectively and dispassionately - is really a great thing.  I mean, you wouldn't want Katy to be an EVIL stepmother, would you?  Of course you wouldn't.  And it also sounds like your granddaughter feels affection toward Katy, which is also a good thing.  Surely you want your granddaughter to grow up in a home filled with love, not animosity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me tell you a story from my own experience.  My best friend from high school married at age 19.  At age 24 she had a daughter.  At age 28, when her daughter was four years old, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor.  My friend fought that cancer valiantly for four horrible years.  She died at age 32 when her daughter was eight years old.  Her husband remarried quickly, about a year later.  I had a hard time with that, but I told myself that the daughter needed a mother.  I reached out in a friendly manner to his new wife, and we exchanged some letters and phone calls.  It was a good thing - until both he and his new wife passed away within a couple of years of that marriage.  The daughter was raised by his sister, a single woman who never married.  I managed to keep in touch through Christmas cards and occasional letters.  I next saw the daughter after she had graduated from high school.  Amazingly, she turned out to be an honor student, well adjusted and normal, thanks to her aunt's diligence in raising her.  She went on to graduate from college and married a wonderful classmate.  I attended her wedding and it was a joy to see their happiness.  They have now been married 14 years and have two darling little boys of their own.  \n\nI've spoken with the daughter, and she tells me she remembers very little about her early childhood except that her mother was \"always sick,\" which is understandable, since it took up the entire span of her life from age four through eight.  But the fact remains that a child NEEDS a mother figure.  Please don't begrudge your granddaughter this relationship because of your own pain of loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's been ten years since your daughter passed away.  The fact that you are still feeling her loss so acutely tells me that it might be helpful for you to seek out some grief counseling.  I don't say that lightly.  I was not able to attend my friend's funeral because we lived 500 miles apart and I was pregnant at the time of her death and then gave birth two months prematurely so was unable to travel.  I never had the chance to say goodbye to her properly.  I wasn't really able to \"lay her to rest\" in my heart until I saw her daughter again - coincidentally, ten years later - when she was 18 and had graduated from high school.  Her daughter bears a strong resemblance to my friend.  It was quite the emotional experience for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease get some help for yourself.  Don't take this out on your granddaughter.", "YTA. Annie\u2019s dead and that\u2019s terrible I am so sorry for your loss.

When her mom died, she was 4. The memories that she has of her are just imprints mostly and maybe a few clear events that are core memories. What she is probably aching for the most is some of me to have that mother connection with, that has been missing from her life. She most likely has very conflicted feelings about having a connection to her dad's new partner, then you snap at her. Now she is probably feeling guilt for not remembering more about her mom, and then also feeling a bond with this person. Take the break from them and find some help in your grief.", "NAH, Never in the grand history of time will Annie stop being your granddaughter's mother. She will add another mother figure,  but never replace. Your heart is very hurt and it must grieve you to see milestones pass that Annie has missed, but it cannot stop the flow of life.

I am sorry for your loss. It seems you are still grieving and should speak with someone and work through better ways to handle it with the grands.  No one is replacing her.

Holidays are hard anyways and add everything else..  you need to in time reach out to David and Katie and speak with them and apologize .  Then work with them to speak and apologize to the kids.

However, your granddaughter was 4 when she died - she likely has very few, if any at all, memories of her biological mother. \n\nKaty is the only maternal figure your granddaughter knows.

I hate even thinking about dying and how hard it would be for them. But I truly, truly hope that if I were to die today my husband would fall in love again, get remarried, and our children would have a loving new mother. I hope that she would raise them as her own and they would consider her their mom as much as I ever was because all a parent wants is for their child to be loved.\n\nI know I wouldn\u2019t be forgotten. I wouldn\u2019t want them to feel eternally stuck in grief by fear of replacing me though. I would want them to remember, but move forward.

Katy was barely able to form long term memories at 4 and went a long time without a mother figure and you\u2019d dare try and take that from her?\n\nGet grief counseling before you loose access to one of the last surviving pieces of your daughter that\u2019s on this planet.", "She also doesn't say how long they have been together.  \n\nThis woman might have been part of this kids life longer than her mother was. \n\nSad yes. But that's just life sometimes.", "I just noticed that OP describes Annie as (32 F). I think 32 is the age *she would have been had she lived.*\n\nOP has not come to terms with the idea that her daughter is no longer in the world. It's right there in the post, too:  *I felt that I was getting upset as it should have been Annie doing these things with her, not Katy.*\n\nShe's somehow managed to feel that Katy has *displaced* her daughter, which simply isn't the case.", "She's a recovering drug addict. \n\nI found out because when she was in active addiction she stole from friends of ours who told me. When I spoke to Katy about it, she told me everything.", "She's a recovering drug addict, she's been on the verge of relapse a couple times. I don't like the idea of a recovering addict being around my grandchild especially at such an influential age.", "Said they have been together for 3 years and that David even waited a year before introducing Katy to the kids.", "That's ... disturbing! OP needs help. Meanwhile SOL and family need to stay away for their own sake!", "Also this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/comments/107vgh6/how\\_do\\_i\\_talk\\_to\\_my\\_son\\_in\\_law\\_about\\_my\\_concerns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/107vgh6/how_do_i_talk_to_my_son_in_law_about_my_concerns/)\n\nOP seems unhinged.", "So she was honest with you about her past, and you want to hold that against her?", "One word \"RECOVERY\"\nNo one will ever measure up to hour daughter but your SIL and grandchildren deserve to be happy. How many Mother's Days have your grandchildren suffered without someone to celebrate? Who will they turn to as they get older? \nThey all deserve to bond with and love someone who loves them back.\nHow would you feel if SIL had met a woman who would never treat the children as her own?", "YTA.", "A recovering addict MIGHT hurt your granddaughter, whereas you DID hurt your granddaughter. You SIL is doing the right thing by taking some time and distance from you. \n\nIf you want any relationship with your granddaughter, you need to sincerely apologize (google the parts of an apology) and give them space. Frankly, it\u2019s your only hope of spending another Christmas with them.", "Well, it isn\u2019t your child nor is it your decision to make. These her HIS children. He is the only person with parental rights here.\n\nIf you continue to act so controlling. (with a family you have no control over) You are going to lose them all, permanently.", "But she didn\u2019t relapse. \n\nThe fact that she could have and didn\u2019t is a HUGE thing. \n\nHer dad doesn\u2019t see her as a danger and you don\u2019t get to decide that someone who is in recovery is a danger, recovery is a life long process when one has the disease of addiction. She will always be in recovery. If her dad feels she is safe to be around his kid you have zero say I. Whether or not she\u2019s a safe person to be around based on simply her being in recovery", "Are you sure that's what your snapping at your granddaughter really was about in the first place? You told us a - heartbreaking - story about the pain you felt when your granddaughter called someone else mom, and about how you feel in so many situations that it should have been your daughter making all these experiences with your grandchild. I can feel your grief through your words, and be sure I understand it \n\nBut I realize that these issues with Katies former lifestyle were not part of the story, so, may I ask if it could be possible that this is how you try to somehow justify your reaction after it happened?", "As someone who comes from a family of drug addicts (also have neighbors who were addicts). Sometimes seeing how drugs can affect a person will create a lesson that you otherwise don\u2019t receive. This lesson depending on how you look at it could be something good or bad whichever way you choose depends on the person. Just because she\u2019s a recovering addict (this is life long) doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a good person now. David and your grandkids if anything are a support system for Katy, just like she is a support system for them. If your granddaughter wants to call her mum then she can it doesn\u2019t matter what Katy\u2019s past was, what matters is where the future leads.", "How old was Katy when she lost her mother? At Christmas. It sounds like that is part of the bond she has made with your granddaughter. Her sad experiences may be the ones to help your daughter process her loss and avoid spiralling like Katy may have.", "This is such a sad outdated take. So many people have struggles in life, and thinking that somehow makes them bad people is just terrible. That just creatures a culture of shame.", "Having lived with a late-stage alcoholic... And also since my uncle fell off the wagon after a long time of being sober... I feel like I could never trust someone close to me to never go back; I think I would always be watching out for signs that they'd relapsed. I don't like it that it's like that for me, but I feel like it's not something I get to decide. I would never deny that you're in a difficult situation.\n\n*However.* The situation is not going to change because you don't like it. I would *hope* that the dad and Katy have a plan in case of relapse so the kids aren't subjected to that, but even if not... Especially the 14-year-old is probably more aware, understanding, and capable of dealing with something like that than you think.\n\nI think the best thing for you to do is to try to establish yourself as someone who can be trusted and *sympathetic* to all parties in case a relapse *does* happen. Because with the way things stand... If I were your granddaughter... The way things stand, I would not rely on you because I would *not* appreciate being told how I should relate to my loved ones; my mother did a little of that, trying to push me toward her family, and I ended up pushing back because I resented being told who I should care about. Because it was disrespectful to the fact that I'm my own person, because it's not something I could really control in the first place, and because I felt like she wanted me to be someone other than who I was. Further, your granddaughter will not want to be open about Katy's struggles to someone whom she thinks doesn't like Katy in the first place (which, I would not be at all surprised if she was aware of how you feel about her); it would feel like a betrayal of someone I loved. And what's more, I would feel like... Even if you never said, \"I told you so,\" I would be worried about being viewed that way; I might feel humiliated and angry because I would *feel* like you were probably thinking it.\n\nAgain, I know you're in a difficult position here. I think you need to apologize to your granddaughter and *be open* about your feelings about your daughter. *It's me, not you.* I wouldn't talk about how you feel about Katy... Although if she brings it up, I wouldn't lie, because she'll know it's BS; I would go for that same *me-not-you/her* approach. You might mention that you worry about how a relapse would affect *everyone, including Katy,* and that you absolutely *do not want* it to happen. I think 14 is old enough to understand things like that, and what's more, I think your granddaughter will feel respected if you're frank and treat her like an adult. I mean, she's *not* an adult, but she's old enough to be levelled with. Maybe she won't respond the way you want her to, in which case you should accept how she *does* respond (with the understanding that she *is* still a kid, that she may not always respond maturely, and that she needs space to make her own choices). But at that point, the ball's out of your court. I just think that honesty is the best way to go here.", "I worry about the effect this will have on my grandchildren, especially if she was to relapse. She's been on the verge of relapsing several times. \n\nI worry how they'll cope if they lose someone else close. How David would cope if he lost another wife.", "I get your initial hesitation. It\u2019s reasonable to have been concerned. But now you\u2019re hiding behind fear of something that may never happen because it allows you to ignore the real problem. You are demonizing her for something that takes GREAT strength of character to overcome.\n\nHave you considered that HER grief from losing her mom at a young age contributed to her developing an addiction? Have you considered that she is in a position to (and based on the closeness of their relationship HAS) help your grandchildren navigate a sad and complicated situation with love?\n\nYou\u2019re not just wrong for snapping. You\u2019re wrong for even mentioning it to your granddaughter in that perspective. You can be sad and share that you\u2019re sad, but you can\u2019t put it on your 14 year old granddaughter to bear your grief, regrets, and anger! And you can\u2019t expect her to not move forward because you\u2019re having a hard time doing so. Her mother, your daughter, would not want that because no loving mother does/would.\n\nYou need to apologize to your grandchildren, your SIL, and Katy. And if you\u2019re finding it hard to summon the courage, just do a quick search of AITA + NC + stepmom. That will show you what a monstrous stepmom really looks like.\n\nYou say you are worried about what another loss will do to them. What about the loss of a grandma, the strongest connection to her mom? How is it going to help her if this relationship ends with you unloading resentment and anger on her as if it\u2019s her fault you are sad? You need to seek help for your grief that is not your teenage granddaughter.", "She told you she was on the verge of relapsing?", "And you know that she has been in the verge of relapsing how exactly? You\u2019ll forgive me if I assume your attitude doesn\u2019t exactly invite her to share personal confidences with you.", "Yeah, sorry, I simply don't believe you anymore. You hurt your granddaughter beyond belief, THAT I believe.", "Being concerned is fine. Trying to interfere with David's family? NOT FINE.", "This sounds like an after-the-fact justification. You were so lucky that he continued to bring your granddaughter around so you could watch her grow up. If you want to stay in her life, it\u2019s past time for a sincere apology. \n\nAlso, did you use your time with her to talk about her mom? To help keep her memory alive? I ask because my own father died when I was 5. My mom also continued to bring us to see our grandmother, and she talked about my dad all the time. I loved hearing things about him. It made me feel connected. \n\nIf you wanted to keep Annie\u2019s memory alive in your granddaughter\u2019s heart, that should have started a long time ago. And even then, you have to understand that a kid can have two moms. It doesn\u2019t diminish either.", "You're just looking for excuses to be mad at that person. \n\nDon't, it's not healthy....move on with Your life. Don't push Your grandchildren away from You.", "Wow, all of this is so well-stated.", "And if she has, what a betrayal it would be to find out how judgmental OP is being of her here! Walking away from a potential relapse with your sobriety intact is no small thing, and definitely something the recovery community celebrates. Especially because of people like OP who seem to think that if the thought so much as crosses your mind you might as well just do it, you're already terrible."]}
