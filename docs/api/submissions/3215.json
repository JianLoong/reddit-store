My mom is a landlord so I asked her if we could stay in one of her properties while we figured out a more permanent housing solution. My husband decided we weren't going to move because he thought we had a good chance to fight the eviction.\n\nAround December when I would have been roughly 4 months pregnant we lost the eviction case and had only a week to vacate. My mom said the offer for us to stay at her duplex for a bit was still good, and I started packing here and there but I'm very much a last minute person and knew for me at least packing would be easier to do all at once right before we moved. \n\nMy mom came over 4ish days before we were supposed to move and came in unannounced, like just opened the door and came in. When she saw that we weren't fully packed she laid into my husband for not having the house all the way packed already, then drove to find me at work where she berated me on the salesfloor in front of customers and my coworkers about how she's going to force him to take responsibility and he's not welcome in her property until he cleans his act up, because how dare he not have the house completely packed by this point. \n\nFor some context, my husband was fired because he developed a skin condition that left him disabled and in chronic, extreme pain. Physical activity was very hard for him and he could only do a little at a time before it got to be too much. He was also severely depressed so I was managing the household while he tried to recover.\n\nAfter she said I could stay but he couldn't, I decided fuck that and we were able to find another apartment with the help of a friend, luckily. But I've never forgiven her for saying she'd rather her pregnant daughter be homeless if I was going to stay with him.\n\nSo our relationship did not improve throughout the pregnancy and when the day came, I knew they wouldn't get along at the hospital and I would need to pick only one of them. I picked my husband, and my mom says it's the cruelest thing anyone has ever done to her since that will likely be her only grandchild.\n\nWas I wrong to keep her from being there?

We didn't go to her first because my mom had already offered. As for the packing, boxing up all the little things was really easy and I'm actually really good at getting things organized to move. I had the whole place ready to go in one day. Since I didn't have to worry about keeping things out that we were going to still need it was a lot easier\n\nMy husband and his brother moved all the big stuff though. But we didn't really have a lot of things to move luckily.", "Idk my Mom was there when my sister gave birth.

My sister wanted her Mom, our other sister, and her husband.", "Wow. Still gaslighting you after all this time. Did she finally succeed in pushing hubby out of your life?", "You are a superwoman! Congratulations on the birth of your child!", "Nope, we just had our 10th anniversary!", "Thank you! He's pretty amazing!", "Glad to hear it.", "Same, I\u2019m having my mum and not my husband."]}
