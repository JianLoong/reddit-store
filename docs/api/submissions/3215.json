My mom is a landlord so I asked her if we could stay in one of her properties while we figured out a more permanent housing solution. My husband decided we weren't going to move because he thought we had a good chance to fight the eviction.\n\nAround December when I would have been roughly 4 months pregnant we lost the eviction case and had only a week to vacate. My mom said the offer for us to stay at her duplex for a bit was still good, and I started packing here and there but I'm very much a last minute person and knew for me at least packing would be easier to do all at once right before we moved. \n\nMy mom came over 4ish days before we were supposed to move and came in unannounced, like just opened the door and came in. When she saw that we weren't fully packed she laid into my husband for not having the house all the way packed already, then drove to find me at work where she berated me on the salesfloor in front of customers and my coworkers about how she's going to force him to take responsibility and he's not welcome in her property until he cleans his act up, because how dare he not have the house completely packed by this point. \n\nFor some context, my husband was fired because he developed a skin condition that left him disabled and in chronic, extreme pain. Physical activity was very hard for him and he could only do a little at a time before it got to be too much. He was also severely depressed so I was managing the household while he tried to recover.\n\nAfter she said I could stay but he couldn't, I decided fuck that and we were able to find another apartment with the help of a friend, luckily. But I've never forgiven her for saying she'd rather her pregnant daughter be homeless if I was going to stay with him.\n\nSo our relationship did not improve throughout the pregnancy and when the day came, I knew they wouldn't get along at the hospital and I would need to pick only one of them. I picked my husband, and my mom says it's the cruelest thing anyone has ever done to her since that will likely be her only grandchild.\n\nWas I wrong to keep her from being there? Was I overreacting to her not letting my husband stay because she didn't think he deserved it?", "created_utc": 1669388840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4fknh/aita_for_not_letting_my_mom_attend_the_birth_of/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom clearly ruined her relationship with you when she refused to allow your husband to live with you. By making that decision, she made it harder for you and your husband and so it was your husband that deserved to watch his child be born, not your mom.", "NTA. Your mom is so toxic I am surprised you haven\u2019t cut her out of your life. She is trying to control you by getting rid of your husband. If you don\u2019t cut her out for yourself do it for your husband and baby.

The saftey of the mother and child is priority #1, and if her being there was going to stress you out, she shouldn't be there. Actions have consequences, and not being there for the birth is the consequence of her actions.", "NTA.\n\nYou are the one who gives birth, so you are the one who decides who\u2018s there and who\u2018s not.

You made the completely right decision.", "NTA, your mother made her choice too.  How could you exclude the father of the child?", "Nta omg. None of this is about your mom but she sure wants it to be. No one is entitled to either children or grandchildren. No one is entitled to be there for the birth except the person giving birth and the people who will care for them.  How dare she berate you at work, possibly getting you in trouble and then how would you be able to take care of her precious grandchild? She didn't care bc its not about the kid. If she were my mom she'd be lucky to EVER see the child after she put both you and the way you care for her grandchild in danger.  Then she berates the child's father.  How is that good for her grandchild? To put it bluntly, she made it abundantly clear she does not,  in fact,  give 2 craps about your child. If her intentions were to care for the child she blew it. Buh bye lady.", "NTA.  She had no right to barge into your home and yell at you and your husband like you are children.  Then to try and say he's not welcome?  For me, the relationship would never be the same.", "NTA, she's a grandparent not a parent. He has the right to be at the birth of his child and it sounds like your mom is the reason they can't both be there. Actions have consequences. But your mother already got to be there for the birth of her child/children. Now it's you and your husband's turn. She thought because she was going to offer you a place to live, she could have a say in every little part of your lives. Even to the point of blowing up and causing a scene because she wasn't happy with how you were packing up your own house. You dodged a bullet finding literally anywhere else to stay.", "NTA...Setting aside all of the family drama, basic protocol is that it's entirely up to the mother who is in the delivery room. Pick whoever you want.  Good luck!", "NTA. And let her know she is the family specialist for cruel behavior.", "NTA, your mother is TA.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour mother made her choices and now needs to live with the consequences.  Basically, she should have known that treating a chronically ill person and his pregnant wife like shit would mean being kept at a distance by them, regardless of DNA.", "NTA why do mums need to watch a baby come out of you?! Like it's still her grand child she doesn't need to see it come out! (Sorry for saying it)", "NTA. Your mom has to live with the consequences of her actions and it isn't cruel of you to not allow her to be there when she has proven that she doesn't know how to behave in a respectful, adult way. Maintain those boundaries. It's perfectly reasonable for you to restrict access to you and your child if she's going to behave that way.", "For some more context, she wasn't allowed in the hospital at all, not just the delivery room. I didn't trust her to be nice and not make drama", "It\u2019s ironic that she\u2019s against you \u201ccherry-picking\u201d who can be in the delivery room when she did the exact same thing to you when you and your husband were in need of a place to stay. I also never understand why people demand to be in the delivery room. Your mom sounds like a real gem. You are 100% NTA here.", "Your mother decided to judge your husband because he didn't do the packing in the same way and pace she would have. Then she went to cause a scene at your work about how your husband should be berated.

Even if she hadn\u2019t said anything cruel about your husband, the person giving birth gets to decide who\u2019s there and who isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a tough job, and birthing people need to surround themselves with people who will support them.", "NTA. My mom tries this shit with me to keep me in her toxic loop. Good for you for standing up.", "NTA. Standing up for your husband who had zero fault in the situation you found yourselves in, is what a committed wife should do. Your mother was so out of line trying to manipulate you into leaving your husband. It's incredible to me she thinks you would even for a minute entertain the idea of having her there at your child's birth. \n\nYour nucleus family is you, your husband and that precious baby. Stand firm until you see real remorse and accountability occur on her part, and amends made with your husband. Having a present and loving father is much better for a child than a relationship with a judgemental and manipulative grandparent.", "NTA\n\nCovid/hospital rules (or whatever).

She doesn't get to demand a place in your space.\n\nBut honestly, since you can't forgive her for trying to make you homeless while you were pregnant, why even continue having contact with her? If it's something you can't forgive, it's time to move on", "NTA\n\nShe chose to be rude to your husband then basically say she'd rather you be homeless than him living there. She made her bed.", "NTA. Birthing a baby is not a spectator sport. You chose the person you wanted there the most *as is your right.* If your mom wants to be a bigger part of your life and the life of your child, she needs to accept that your husband is part of the package and treat him with respect.", "NTA crossed the line so many times I'm not really sure why you are not NC with her.", "If you're only allowed to pick one, and this truly ends up being your mother's only grandchild, wouldn't that likely make it your husband's only child too? Why would she think that her being there is more important than him being there? \n\nNever mind that fact that if you're giving birth with your fluids and bits spread out everywhere, you get to say who's in that room, period, end of story.

She had one bridge, and instead of using a match to light the way,she poured kerosene on it and set it ablaze.   \nShe can stay out of your life.

For better or worse you made your choice and she has to live with it unless she makes some serious apologies.", "NTA. Also. You\u2019re allowed one person. It\u2019s freakin normal that the dab be that one person. Why would your mom be more welcome? And that\u2019s not even counting all the drama. But it certainly only serves to reinforce the point.

Her mother, fine. Her partner, fine. Nobody, fine too. But non one else has a say. You do not book your seat...", "Its very common for the person going through labor to want their mom there. A thing about they went through this already and those moms generally having taken care of the person when they were sick as a child. So its a thing but generally one that happens when there's a good relationship and the person feels the mom will be supportive.

If she\u2019d asked of course I would have, but it\u2019s not a right! What is wrong with some people? NTA, but your mum is for so many reasons. I would be going LC/NC after explaining you need to put her on timeout for attacking you at work, attacking your husband, and making demands. Also, congrats on the baby :)", "It may be common, but if you are in a healthy relationship with the baby,'s father, I don't get wanting any one but him and medical staff there.
