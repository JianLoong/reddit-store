He said if I \"must\" tell anyone, I should say he cheated with a girl because \"it is no different\". \n\nTo me it is different but I can't express why which he says is a sign of prejudice.

That guy is barely legal and definitely not mature enough.", "Per op:\n\nI understand that homophobia exists everywhere but our country is accepting overall and we live in a liberal, metropolitan area. It is very possible he will face judgement but there is very little risk of violence or serious career consequences (other than him sleeping with a much younger person who he has authority over which may cause problems regardless of gender). I know it's still not something I should do lightly.", "What punishment do you think he should get?  Outing someone risks them losing absolutely everything, maybe even their life.", "I would be saying the same thing if it was women at 18 your an adult it doesn't matter", "And someone he has authority over. Also the AP may have been under 18 when they started the affair.", "Apparently, the husband KNOWS that there will be grave consequences, even if not work-related, when he's outed.  Why the hell else would he have lived this ridiculous lie for so many years.  Why would he have bothered?  Why has his mind been so affected that he leads a double life?\n\nEdit: grammar", "He ruined her life.", "Being 18 doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re mature. It\u2019s a huge difference between a grown ass 37 year old and a barely legal person.", "Those are only questions he can answer. While he\u2019s at it he should probably answer why he thought it was okay to betray her trust and repeatedly put her through emotional torture by picking a fight with his PREGNANT wife to go be with his affair partner. His actions are despicable and being in the closet does not absolve him", "I know that hell I personally wouldn't date anyone younger than me and I'm 26 I'm just saying we don't get to label him a predator just because we don't agree with it. Give him a side eye sure but predator? Nah that's overboard"]}
