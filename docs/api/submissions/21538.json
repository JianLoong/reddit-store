Somewhere in the many conversations, BIL started talking about starting a business. This peaked my interest as I know BIL doesn\u2019t follow through with anything but he sounds excited. So I joined the conversation and it turns out BIL wants to open a laundry mat and has done some amazing and detailed research into the matter. He knows how much it\u2019ll cost to start the business, how long it\u2019ll take to turn a profit, how much revenue he can expect, the city\u2019s and state\u2019s regulations, and the tax obligations. In short, he did all the leg it takes to go to a bank to ask for a loan. For once I was actually interested in what BIL but I wasn\u2019t interested in his business plan as I had a great job at the time.\n\nMonths afterwards, the company I worked for started to receive less work orders and my great job was on shaky grounds. I updated my resume and started looking for another job. Then I remembered BIL\u2019s laundry mat plan and started looking into it.\n\nTo make a long story short, I sold much of my stuff, pooled all of my money together, and maxed out my credit card to open a laundry mat in my city. I\u2019m making almost as much money now as I did at my great job and my earnings are projected to keep on rising. In fact I\u2019m in the process of opening a 2nd location and if it performs well, I\u2019ll open a 3rd. \n\nCurrently.\n\nI flew home for the 4th of July week and that\u2019s where things hit the fan. My sister and BIL started making passive aggressive comments about my business and when they found out about the 2nd location, their comments turned fully aggressive. They accused me of stealing BIL\u2019s business plan and profiting of his legwork. I argued we live 7 hours from each other and there\u2019s nothing stopping them from opening the same business. They argued I would have never done it until BIL gave me all of the financial details which in truth, is correct. Never in a million years would I have thought I would open a laundry mat. However I didn\u2019t actually use his numbers as I did not need a loan from the bank.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge fight between us right now and they demand I bring BIL into my business. My parents think I should because it was his idea and it\u2019ll keep the peace in the family. I don\u2019t think I should since he came up with the idea but I did all of the necessary work to make it actually happen.\n\nWhat do you think?", "created_utc": 1688680313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sn1kz/aita_for_stealing_my_bils_business/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One which would in no way compete with BIL doing the same wherever he wanted.\n\nIf he considered his briliant (and public domain) research so valuable... maybe he should have made everyone sign an NDA and Do Not Compete contract.

It's not like he came up with the laundromat concept, he just had an idea to open one. And it sounds like he still hasn't gone through with it and you're looking to open a 3rd. Sounds like jealousy...", "NTA. Your bil might have given you the initial idea. But you put your sweat & hard-earned cash into actually opening a laundromat. Which he has not.\n\nFFS, you guys live 7 hours apart. You aren't exactly competing with him. You don't owe him a damned thing. He needs to get off his ass & open his own instead of whining that you stole his idea.", "NTA. You\u2019re 7 hours apart. Pure petulance", "NTA \n\nThe old \"You snooze, you lose\" but all is not lost. He can still do it. \n\nBtw, if he didn't want to share his info on it, no one was twisting his arm.

Your business is in another city, dealing with other regulations, competition, suppliers, market demand etc. Your BIL is jealous because you actually followed through and worked your way into success. Bringing him into the business to \"keep the peace\" is a terrible idea. It'll just lead to more conflict. He won't lift a finger to contribute, but he'll get in your way constantly.

It's a laundromat, they're everywhere. \n\nThat said, I do understand where BIL would be offended, especially as he's not yet made his plan a reality, so I think that a little bit of empathy and gratitude here could go a long way.", "There's more at stake here than fairness.  You might consider some sort of finder's fee to BIL, to compensate him for sparking your business plan.  Maybe 10% of the first year's profits, but if you decide on this, be sure he executes a legally binding release that he has no further claim on your business.\n\nIf this will help bring about peace in the family and ease BIL's sense of injury, it could be worth it.\n\nBut ultimately, it would be a gift.

There is a reason he hasn't followed through with any of his ideas and that will carry over into any business you tow run. Tell him that if he wants to join with you he needs to start up his own laundromat, on his own and make a go of it.
