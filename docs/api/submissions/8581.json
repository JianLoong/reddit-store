Then we drifted apart and later she became close friends with my wife, Natalie.\n\nOlive has a lot of issues with our marriage for some reason and she tries to influence Natalie a lot. Her biggest issue is with how Natalie and I handle our finances. \n\nNatalie has a history of making bad financial decisions and racking up credit card debt. For that reason, she does not have access to my savings account. I make 3 times as much as Natalie and she is terrible at saving money, so almost all of the money in the savings account was put there by me. Despite this, I think of that money as both of ours and one day, it will go towards the purchase of our shared home.\n\nFor some mysterious reason, Natalie told Olive all about or finances during a night of drinking and Olive has been obsessed with it since. She told Natalie she should demand access to the savings account, spend as much on clothes as she wishes, etc.\n\nI really don't think it's an accident that after every single night out, Natalie starts a fight with me about our finances. Especially since Natalie brought up how Olive and her husband do their finances in a much better way.\n\nNow to the point: I have a full remote job at a foreign company that pays way better than the ones in my country. I alone make more in a month than my friend and Olive together. Just 1.5 months ago, Olive managed to get a full remote job like mine too.\n\nSo naturally, now she is trying to act like a role model I should follow and tells my wife things like \"Now *I* make 3 times as much as my husband, but he has access to my every penny. Natalie, this is what you and your husband should do too! You should demand it!\"\n\nAfter Natalie told me this, I messaged Olive and told her to stop. She told me that if I don't like that she is helping Natalie build some standards and making her question things, maybe I could try being a better husband to her.\n\nI replied that her obsession with my marriage is unhealthy and going out of her way and interviewing to dozens of foreign companies just to be able to interfere with my marriage even more is really fucking insane.\n\nShe then said I was showing symptoms of paranoia and should seek psychiatric help. It's Natalie, who comes to her for advice on our marriage and she only answers her.\n\nYeah, that's a load of bullshit. I know Olive. I know she becomes obsessed with things and keep pushing until she gets what she wants. I know I'm right.

You need to sit down and have apparently several conversations with your wife - a handful about money management, a couple about WHY you keep a separate account, and a few about not inviting outsiders into your marital decisions.", "NTA, but it seems a lengthy conversation with your wife is in order. Does she know why you keep the money on a different account? Does she know how you feel about her friend? \n\n  \nBased on how you wrote the post, it feels like you're trying to avoid your wife altogether, while she should be the first person you talk to and make your point clear to. You should however stop being bullheaded and not be \"100% sure you are right\", when going into that conversation. In a marriage you often have to meet in the middle and find a consensus, otherwise I doubt it will last much longer.", "NTA\n\n  She is wayy out of line. Especially since the reason Natalie doesn't have acces to that money is because she spends a lot, not because you didn't want to. And that money goes into buying a house, which will belong to the both of you. That woman needs a life. Start interfering with her marriage too, see if she likes it. My guess is that she wants you and wants to drive a wedge between your wife and you.", "NTA. What happens in your relationship should only be between you two. BUT you need to discuss this with your wife, and set boundaries on what\u2019s not appropriate to talk about with others when coming to your relationship.", "Nta and if your wife can\u2019t understand she isn\u2019t in a position to have control over money when she frequently causes debt. You 2 need separate finances with one joint account for bills. You both put whatever you agree upon in the joint account then there\u2019s nothing left to talk about. There\u2019s nothing wrong with getting outside help in your marriage but this type of help isn\u2019t helpful and it\u2019ll only lead to more hurt disrespect and eventually divorce. I would say talk to your wife and make it clear your uncomfortable with her speaking to Olive about your private details and set clear boundaries since Olive is taking her position from friend to defender over someone else\u2019s money.", "NTA when\u2019s the last time you sat down and worked through your finances with your wife? Sounds like she needs a fresh smack of reality if she\u2019s that bad with money.", ">It's Natalie, who comes to her for advice on our marriage and she only answers her.\n\nAs a women, I will say A LOT of female friends do this. Repeatedly ask my advice on their relationship. It gets annoying giving someone the same advice over & over so you become direct. Their partner acts weird with you. Eventually it comes out your friend is telling her partner, *excel_pager420 says this & this about our relationship & this needs to change*. Rather than saying, \"I have an issue with this aspect of our relationship\". Now your friends partner thinks you're interfering in their relationship because your friend uses you to communicate things she dislikes. In reality you're fed up with her asking advice on the same issue for months/years. \n\nDo you think Natalie might feel uncomfortable voicing her opinions on shared marital finances due to her past behaviour? So it comes out when she's drunk as *Olive thinks this*? It sounds valid that a women might be uncomfortable with the concept of not being allowed access to shared marital savings, even if they trust you & understand why.\n\nOlive sounds smart with money. Olive sounds like a career women. Highly paid remote working has been the ideal job since March 2020, she hears a lot about the benefits from her best friend whose husband (*you*) has a remote job. I wouldn't assume Olives job change is about you tbh. Either you think your wife is so weak-willed she can be completely swayed by one conversation, which is serious marital issue. Or your wife is using \"Olive thinks\" to communicate her discomfort, which is a serious marial issue. Either way you need to be talking to your wife, not Olive. Maybe consider couples counseling to change the current communication style? ESH (*except Olive who y'all need to stop bringing into your marriage*)", "INFO One thing that stands out is that OP doesn't tell us what the financial arrangement is in their marriage. The one key issue that set the core of the dispute is not explained. Typically that means there's something to be concealed.\n\nWhat exactly is your financial setup? Who makes what amount of money, or at least what percent relative to the other person? Where does that money go? Who pays the bills? How is the math for all of this done? Does everyone have some kind of budget that they can freely use each month? How big is that?\n\nDepending on the answers to the above questions, we could be in a situation where Natalie is upset because she can't spend as much as she wants, or where Natalie is upset because she's being financially abused. Or maybe the setup is simply unclear, so she's upset because she doesn't know what's going on.\n\nIt was also notable that OP said that their own savings is something they plan on using for a large joint purchase. But they didn't say that Natalie understood or even knew that to be the case. While in some situations it's perfectly fine to have secret savings accounts, that's also totally irrelevant to the story here, except to the extent that it's used to garner sympathy. After all, Natalie can't feel good about something that she doesn't know exists, even if it's ostensibly for her sake too.", "NTA, Olive needs to fuck off with immediate effect. She has no business meddling in your marriage like this. Have you considered maybe giving your wife a small allowance for her to do the things she likes? If she's factored into your budget in this small way it might be enough to satisfy her. Not Olive, your wife. I think you need to talk to your buddy as well, and tell him his wife is not going to be welcome if she continues to bad mouth you to your wife. And your wife needs to stop letting this woman lead her around by the nose so much. Olive doesn't see to her needs you do!", "YTA. She just magically got a high paying remote job like yours? \n\nTalk to your wife. She\u2019s the one with the problem, she keeps bringing it up and you\u2019re married to her. Stop focusing on Olive, it\u2019s easier to blame her than work on your marriage.", "I don't think Olive is the problem? Like...Natalie is a grown woman who can think for herself. She's the one choosing to share information about your finances with Olive. Olive may or may not be obsessed, but why is Natalie incapable of setting a boundary? I'm leaning YTA because I think you're addressing the wrong issue.", "NTA, she needs to mind her own business, have a serious conversation with your wife, she sounds like a toxic person to have a friendship with.", "NTA for the most. You manage your finance how you see fit. I earn a lot as well and I manage the finances because my husband is not so great at managing that. However, and this is the part where you could be TA, this is agreed between us.\nYou are married and supposed to share ressources or at least discuss how you handle it. Like have a proportional split of the expenses as if she is bringing 25% of the household money, then her contribution should be 25% of household expenses. Because if 75% of her earnings are going into the household then she can't save. Or you have to downgrade your lifestyle so she can afford to live on her earnings.\n\nYou need to talk to your wife and discuss what she wants and needs and come to a compromise on the family budget. This will spontaneously kick the third parties out if everybody is happy about the arrangement.", "NTA, but some of this was worded a bit AH; I always cringe a little when a dude uses crazy or insane to describe a woman, it sorta discredits your argument in my eyes a bit (I\u2019m also wondering if the bit about her getting a job to hurt your marriage is a fact or she just got a better job and you are reaching?) but either way you and your wife need therapy because if you feel the need to keep her out of your savings and not manage money with her than y\u2019all should probably talk about that- it feels wrong even if you have a fair justification.", "YTA - But, only because you\u2019re focusing your energy on the wrong person. This is an issue that needs to be addressed with your wife. It sounds like 1. your wife is discussing marital issues with her friend instead of you and 2. your wife is not fully on board with how you guys are managing your finances.", "I say YTA. \n\nBecause, and I don't know Olive obviously, but it's very possible that your wife IS confiding in her. After all, you literally wrote, \"For some mysterious reason, Natalie told Olive all about our finances during a night of drinking\". Perhaps it's no mysterious reason...Perhaps it was her feeling upset about the financial situation and feeling loose with alcohol among a friend. \n\n  \nAnd that Olive is simply giving your wife her perspective and advice when she does; especially because you said that arguments only happens when they go out together. You may wish to talk to your wife about how she feels before completely dismissing the fact that she may have some dissatisfaction with the way you handle your money, and begrudging Olive and accusing her of interfering with your marriage.", ">For that reason, she does not have access to my savings account. I make 3 times as much as Natalie and she is terrible at saving money, so almost all of the money in the savings account was put there by me.\n\nYTA.\n\nAlmost All? So not literally all? There is some of her money on your savings account that she doesn't have access too because you felt she was bad with money?\n\nIf your partner for the last few months for whatever reason has issues with this, why not offer her to go back to separate finances? So she can at least have access to her own savings account with her own money?\n\nSo how would she go about buying some new clothes now?\n\nOlive isn't the problem here. She may be an annoying loud mouth, but it's up to your wife to manage her frienschips and decide to either stick up for your relationship and not discuss finances with Olive, or to decide that her friend showed her a new perspective and she agrees with her friend, so she's comming to you to ask to renegotiate how you deal with your finances as a couple.\n\nRight now it sounds like you're claiming your wife is so weak-minded she's manipulated by Olive and has no right to agency over your shared finances, because she's not a capable? Why would you stay with someone if you honestly believed that to be the case? Unless of course you want to be able to manipulate the weak-minded one all by yourself and Olive is interfering.\n\nAlso thinking Olive would sabotage her own career just to 'manipulate' your wife, does indeed sound quite paranoia on your part.\n\nYou don't have an Olive problem. You have a wife problem. It sounds like she's unhappy about your current approach to dealing with finances. So sit down and figure out a new way that works for the both of you going forward.\n\nBlaming Olive as way to discredit your wifes desire for change, is AHish territory.  \n\n\nEdit: Got the names mixed up.", "[deleted]", "NTA.  A gentler way of approaching this would have had the same result.  Besides, as a married man, you should not invite another woman for coffee without your wife present.  Others may disagree with me on this, but that\u2019s how I was raised.\n\nyou are being very wise in how you handle the money.

You guys need therapy.  I\u2019d recommend both couples and individual therapy (that should ideally be three different therapists as the objectives are different).

I also had to pay all the bills because he refused to take care of them. He would just throw them in a pile unopened and let them sit while the late fees racked up.

My late husband spent MORE than half of our combined annual income on things we simply couldn't afford to be wasting money on (like gambling and expensive vehicles and taking his coworkers out for pricey restaurant meals), especially in a high COL area. Then he would turn around and not pay his bills so we would end up owning even more in late fees. In the end the only way I shut it down was to completely take over our finances and give him a restricted CASH allowance that allowed him to buy his work lunch, gas, and cigarettes each day and not much more without my input. He wasn't allowed to have a debit card or a credit card. I couldn't even give him money to buy his own clothes because he would go blow it at the casino and not buy the new clothes at all. He simply couldn't be trusted with money at all because he was a compulsive gambler AND a compulsive spender.\n\nBut, unlike your wife, he accepted all of this because he KNEW he had a problem and he knew there was no other way we would ever be able to save up enough to own a house in a nice neighborhood which was our primary goal.", "YTA. Look man I get it, I'm also in a position where I make three times what my SI does, but being married means you share finances equally.

Marriage is not an adversarial relationship financially and you're clearly treating your spouse like an adversary\n\nIf she IS spending out of control then you address that problem as it comes up, but you cannot put child locks on your money because you think your wife is irresponsible and expect her to just be OK with it. She clearly isn't and if you really think of it as \"both of yours\" then you will treat her as an equal in how those decisions are made. If she refuses to treat you as an equal and spends that money irresponsibly and refuses to consult you on big purchases or follow ground rules you both agree on then you take her to marriage counseling or get a divorce. Either way, you've come up with the worst solution to the problem and are reaping the results of it.\n\nEDIT 1: also I have no idea \"the kind of person\" Olive is but if you think someone decided to apply to high paying jobs and get an increase in their salary mostly or hell even IN PART to \"show you how to handle your marital finances\" then yeah you are paranoid.

When I lost my job and was unemployed I still contributed 50% of the bills out of my own savings. When I worked part time I still contributed 50%. When I was self employed through covid and had hardly any clients I still contributed 50%. I would NEVER have expected my partner to contribute more just because he was earning more.

No one is saying wife should have access to OPs share but she has put money into that savings account too and OP does not let her access it. \n\nIt literally cannot get any clearer than that.", "Yeah it's def not a gendered issue. When I was with my ex shortly after my oldest daughter was born, he was working full time and I was a SAHM. I desperately wanted to continue working, but the job I had would've covered childcare costs with about $30 a week left over, but I was paying close to $50 weekly for gas to and from work. And aside from the financial drain of me returning to my job, I was breastfeeding and my daughter struggled with bottles so it made more sense all around for me to stay home with her.\n\nI was terribly worried (and rightfully so) that we'd end up in debt because my ex was very impulsive and awful with money. When the baby was 4 months old, he used most of our rent money to buy a car. Rent was $650 plus utilities and he paid $400 for the car. I was livid. You can't just not pay rent, especially when you have an infant who needs a roof over her head, ESPECIALLY in the winter! It caused a huge argument because his defense for making such a poor financial decision was that \"$400 was a steal! You never find a working car that's in great condition for such a low price. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity!\" No matter how many times I explained to him that we couldn't afford it, he kept defending it. He argued that obviously he could afford it bc he bought it. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Ultimately, it resulted in us being evicted from our home. After that, I took over the finances. Yes, it was *his* money, but our child and the safety and security of our family needed to be priority and since he couldn't manage it himself, I did.\n\nHe told literally everyone he talked to how \"controlling\" I was and how he had to ask me for his own money if he wanted something. He framed it as if I was financially abusing him. I was always the bad guy. I budgeted $70 a week for him to spend on lunches at work, $100 for gas (which was more than enough to cover his daily commute and then some) and an \"allowance\" of $100/week that he could spend however he wanted. With the rest of the money, I made sure all our bills were paid (on time), made sure all household products were covered and all of our daughter's needs AND was able to keep between $50-$75 a week to put back in savings. I couldn't believe that out of his $3,000 monthly take home pay, we were ever even in a financial position that $400 was enough to put us into debt. \n\nIt's certainly not a \"women\" thing and most of us, regardless of gender, do NOT feel that it's appropriate for someone to spend their family into debt. However, there's not enough information in the post to determine whether the wife is *actually* spending inappropriately or OP is controlling the finances as a way to control his wife.\n\nFinancial abuse is certainly a thing, but there are alot of factors in this specific relationship that could take it either way. For instance, friend says wife should be able to access the savings account and buy herself whatever clothes she wants. Does she already have an overflowing closet? Or does she only have a few worn out outfits that don't fit well and more clothes are an actual need? How much is wife spending on clothes? How much is wife contributing to savings account? Since husband makes 3x what she does, are bills split 75/25? Or is wife making equal financial contributions to the household with no spending money at all while OP has financial flexibility and freedom and withholds whatever is left of \"his money\" after he pays his half of the bills? What \"poor financial decisions\" was wife making? Is she gambling and draining money or spending hundreds of dollars on designer clothes regularly? Is she spending her entire check on frivolous and unnecessary stuff leaving nothing to contribute to the shared expenses? It's hard to tell who's the AH here without more info.\n\nHowever, both OP and wife have AH qualities for sure. If wife is bothered by not having access to savings, she needs to speak to her husband. If she's only discussing it with her friend and letting friend speak for her. He's HER husband. She needs to communicate her problems with their marriage to HIM. This is also why I'm not so sure it's necessarily financial abuse. Financial abuse typically isn't stand alone, it's usually coupled with one or more other forms of abuse/control. But if he's abusive, telling a friend and encouraging that friend to confront the abuser rather than looking for resources to get out of the abusive relationship isn't helpful and usually causes more harm to the victim. Like if Johnny beats up his partner Pam frequently, Pam's friend Debbie confronting him and mocking him over it is more likely to trigger another assault on Pam than make Johnny stop. Ya know? OP is also an AH (and definitely paranoid) if he genuinely believes his wifes friend took a job as an attack on him. Nobody takes a job to personally criticize their friends partner. That's foolish and literally makes no sense. Friend is kind of an AH too. If she thinks OPs wife is in a controlling and abusive relationship, mocking and poking at OP won't help her friend at all.\n\nThe only thing that might help the situation is couples counseling. It has a tremendous success rate and can provide lasting tools to encourage better communication.", "It is completely a gender thing, because most of the time it's the woman who overspends, and most of the time it's women who scream financial abuse.\n\nAnd, if you seriously think that every time someone is irresponsible with money, their partner should leave them, how many marriages do you think would exist if they did that? If there is talk of split finances the same people scream financial abuse, because it all should be shared money, according to them.\n\nThe most concerning thing about your comment is, why you would think he doesn't get a say in how their joint finances are spent? Of course he does, and her going on spending trips because she is too irresponsible, and immature to realise that they don't have the money for the lavish lifestyle she thinks they live, should absolutely be something they discuss.

You realize that it sounds insane to assume that someone got a higher paying job just to fuck with you, right?

Your old friend has a pretty big grudge against you and seems hell-bent on destroying your marriage and/or your finances. It's like a bad movie.

Then maybe talk to the friend together to set boundaries on this topic. The friend may be hearing alarm bells because restricting finances by one partner *can be* part of financial abuse. If it's more like OP put it, and the wife is one of those people that just spends whatever money she sees but agrees they should be saving it for a house or other purchases, then some restricted access is probably better. If OP's wife is financially struggling or never able to treat herself, that could be a problem.\nOnce they talk together to sort out what's going on and what they want to do, either the wife or both of them need a hard talk with the friend about boundaries (again, as long as this isn't OP being financially abusive and the friend seeing those indicators)", "No, but you could make the argument that OP could just spend the money if he wants to. \n\nI agree with you that \"okay we both should be able to access it\" doesn't sound like a good idea (because \"I've to pay my cc bills, I'll put it back in next month\" sounds like a reasonable emergency spending, but an easy trap for her to just overspending her limits even further/ regularly).\n\nI've no idea if you can specify something like the goal for the money in a joint account, but in my opinion that seems like a fair solution.\n\nThey obviously need to talk about that and in general some things since if you are married and buy a house and other long term financial stuff it shouldn't be \"I'm managing it because you are continuing to behave in a financial irresponsible way\".\n\nThat's more of a trust fund system than a partnership in my opinion.\n\nThe friend might be overstepping, but I'm not completely sure that it's not just her talking to the friend instead of him.", "I don't know, I think the wife is being honest with Olive if Olive is saying You should be allowed to spend as much money on clothes as you want! \n\nMy question for OP is, is there anything wife wants that she can't have? Other than just endless shopping money lol", "Yeah, I had the same reaction. I am not sure how reliable a narrator the OP is.", "You should read \"Why Does He Do That?\" It's a book on abusive men.

There\u2019s no other reason to encourage a \u201cfriend\u201d with a bad history with money to access her husbands bank account and to spend as freely as she wants.

Always have been. My husband is the opposite. We've been together for nearly 30 years. \n\nWe have NEVER, nor will we EVER, have a joint account.

I spend money like it's water flowing through my hands. \n\nThe thing is, I wouldn't WANT access to my husband's accounts, because I wouldn't trust myself, and I wouldn't abuse his trust, so it's best for us not to go there !  \n\nEvery marriage is different. What works for some wouldn't work for others. So the friend may well be concerned, but OP's wife probably knows, deep down, that she couldn't be trusted with access to his account. \n\nAs a side note, we had to remortgage our house twice because I got into debt.

Chances are he has a wife problem and she\u2019s either not telling the full truth or what he thinks his financial irresponsibility really isn\u2019t And this is a toxic situation.

Saving money for delayed gratification is very important to some people. Plus OP says she jas extra money after expenses and just blows through it.", "I keep repeating this here but the more info is given the more this seems true. OP's post highly resembles examples in a book on abusive men. He claims Natalie is bad at with spending but doesn't actually give any examples. He says she racked up credit card debt. How many people get into credit card debt for a time because they have unexpected expenses but they do take care of it? So he views her in a bad light but doesn't actually give details why. Just vague reasoning.  He takes all windfall income she gets and puts it in an account only he can access. Not an account they both have to sign off on to withdraw from. No one he alone can spend from.", "It does though", "OP is the imposter.", "Oh, agreed. I was just pointing out that OP\u2019s idea of debt and bad purchases is subjective. For him to earn three times as much and lock her out of savings as a punishment seems sketchy to me. Even in his own words it doesn\u2019t seem like a clear NTA at all.", "Ironically, it's my writing that helps.  I write various forms of fiction and enjoy going into character studies, delving into the mindset of hero, villain, and everyone in between.  Watching my mother's ever growing paranoia, I started to dissect her mania and saw some of the people she thought was \"out to get her,\".\n\nI was horrified to find a lot of similar issues in myself...

He refuses to even consider his wife actually has an issue with the situation at all, and places all the blame on Olive, even though the facts suggest otherwise.\n\nCombined with his *insane* accusation that Olive got a new job just to use it against his marriage, I think there's a good chance the \"fights\" are due more to his reaction than her instigation. And even though several people have asked, he hasn't said if she ever brings it up at other times, so we don't actually know just how often this discussion is happening. Taken together, all OP's inferences and omissions are very telling.", "Well for one that post is deleted so i cant see what her POV is and does she call herself Olive in the post too? If so if 2 throwaway accounts are using the same names then im convinced the story is fake then\n\nEdit: found an archive of it. Her post doesnt include that grace has a spending problem, it also doesnt include that the savings account is for a house so no one is taking money out of it. If grace had access would she spend the money? Also only having 500 euro for spending money is a lot! You know how much i have? Not nearly that. Olive post seems to imply that grace is the one footing the bills and the comments reflect that when thats not the case whatsoever. They both share expenses and then dump the extra into savings and OP is the one saving most of the money. Should the house when they buy it only be in his name since hes contributed almost all the money or let me guess that wouldnt be fair?"]}
