Then we drifted apart and later she became close friends with my wife, Natalie.\n\nOlive has a lot of issues with our marriage for some reason and she tries to influence Natalie a lot. Her biggest issue is with how Natalie and I handle our finances. \n\nNatalie has a history of making bad financial decisions and racking up credit card debt. For that reason, she does not have access to my savings account. I make 3 times as much as Natalie and she is terrible at saving money, so almost all of the money in the savings account was put there by me. Despite this, I think of that money as both of ours and one day, it will go towards the purchase of our shared home.\n\nFor some mysterious reason, Natalie told Olive all about or finances during a night of drinking and Olive has been obsessed with it since. She told Natalie she should demand access to the savings account, spend as much on clothes as she wishes, etc.\n\nI really don't think it's an accident that after every single night out, Natalie starts a fight with me about our finances. Especially since Natalie brought up how Olive and her husband do their finances in a much better way.\n\nNow to the point: I have a full remote job at a foreign company that pays way better than the ones in my country. I alone make more in a month than my friend and Olive together. Just 1.5 months ago, Olive managed to get a full remote job like mine too.\n\nSo naturally, now she is trying to act like a role model I should follow and tells my wife things like \"Now *I* make 3 times as much as my husband, but he has access to my every penny. Natalie, this is what you and your husband should do too! You should demand it!\"\n\nAfter Natalie told me this, I messaged Olive and told her to stop. She told me that if I don't like that she is helping Natalie build some standards and making her question things, maybe I could try being a better husband to her.\n\nI replied that her obsession with my marriage is unhealthy and going out of her way and interviewing to dozens of foreign companies just to be able to interfere with my marriage even more is really fucking insane.\n\nShe then said I was showing symptoms of paranoia and should seek psychiatric help. It's Natalie, who comes to her for advice on our marriage and she only answers her.\n\nYeah, that's a load of bullshit. I know Olive. I know she becomes obsessed with things and keep pushing until she gets what she wants. I know I'm right.

You need to sit down and have apparently several conversations with your wife - a handful about money management, a couple about WHY you keep a separate account, and a few about not inviting outsiders into your marital decisions.", "NTA, but it seems a lengthy conversation with your wife is in order. Does she know why you keep the money on a different account? Does she know how you feel about her friend? \n\n  \nBased on how you wrote the post, it feels like you're trying to avoid your wife altogether, while she should be the first person you talk to and make your point clear to. You should however stop being bullheaded and not be \"100% sure you are right\", when going into that conversation. In a marriage you often have to meet in the middle and find a consensus, otherwise I doubt it will last much longer.", "NTA\n\n  She is wayy out of line. Especially since the reason Natalie doesn't have acces to that money is because she spends a lot, not because you didn't want to. And that money goes into buying a house, which will belong to the both of you. That woman needs a life. Start interfering with her marriage too, see if she likes it. My guess is that she wants you and wants to drive a wedge between your wife and you.", "NTA. What happens in your relationship should only be between you two. BUT you need to discuss this with your wife, and set boundaries on what\u2019s not appropriate to talk about with others when coming to your relationship.", "Nta and if your wife can\u2019t understand she isn\u2019t in a position to have control over money when she frequently causes debt. You 2 need separate finances with one joint account for bills. You both put whatever you agree upon in the joint account then there\u2019s nothing left to talk about. There\u2019s nothing wrong with getting outside help in your marriage but this type of help isn\u2019t helpful and it\u2019ll only lead to more hurt disrespect and eventually divorce. I would say talk to your wife and make it clear your uncomfortable with her speaking to Olive about your private details and set clear boundaries since Olive is taking her position from friend to defender over someone else\u2019s money.", "NTA when\u2019s the last time you sat down and worked through your finances with your wife? Sounds like she needs a fresh smack of reality if she\u2019s that bad with money.", ">It's Natalie, who comes to her for advice on our marriage and she only answers her.\n\nAs a women, I will say A LOT of female friends do this. Repeatedly ask my advice on their relationship. It gets annoying giving someone the same advice over & over so you become direct. Their partner acts weird with you. Eventually it comes out your friend is telling her partner, *excel_pager420 says this & this about our relationship & this needs to change*. Rather than saying, \"I have an issue with this aspect of our relationship\". Now your friends partner thinks you're interfering in their relationship because your friend uses you to communicate things she dislikes. In reality you're fed up with her asking advice on the same issue for months/years. \n\nDo you think Natalie might feel uncomfortable voicing her opinions on shared marital finances due to her past behaviour? So it comes out when she's drunk as *Olive thinks this*? It sounds valid that a women might be uncomfortable with the concept of not being allowed access to shared marital savings, even if they trust you & understand why.\n\nOlive sounds smart with money. Olive sounds like a career women. Highly paid remote working has been the ideal job since March 2020, she hears a lot about the benefits from her best friend whose husband (*you*) has a remote job. I wouldn't assume Olives job change is about you tbh. Either you think your wife is so weak-willed she can be completely swayed by one conversation, which is serious marital issue. Or your wife is using \"Olive thinks\" to communicate her discomfort, which is a serious marial issue. Either way you need to be talking to your wife, not Olive. Maybe consider couples counseling to change the current communication style? ESH (*except Olive who y'all need to stop bringing into your marriage*)", "INFO One thing that stands out is that OP doesn't tell us what the financial arrangement is in their marriage. The one key issue that set the core of the dispute is not explained. Typically that means there's something to be concealed.\n\nWhat exactly is your financial setup? Who makes what amount of money, or at least what percent relative to the other person? Where does that money go? Who pays the bills? How is the math for all of this done? Does everyone have some kind of budget that they can freely use each month? How big is that?\n\nDepending on the answers to the above questions, we could be in a situation where Natalie is upset because she can't spend as much as she wants, or where Natalie is upset because she's being financially abused. Or maybe the setup is simply unclear, so she's upset because she doesn't know what's going on.\n\nIt was also notable that OP said that their own savings is something they plan on using for a large joint purchase. But they didn't say that Natalie understood or even knew that to be the case. While in some situations it's perfectly fine to have secret savings accounts, that's also totally irrelevant to the story here, except to the extent that it's used to garner sympathy. After all, Natalie can't feel good about something that she doesn't know exists, even if it's ostensibly for her sake too.", "NTA, Olive needs to fuck off with immediate effect. She has no business meddling in your marriage like this. Have you considered maybe giving your wife a small allowance for her to do the things she likes? If she's factored into your budget in this small way it might be enough to satisfy her. Not Olive, your wife. I think you need to talk to your buddy as well, and tell him his wife is not going to be welcome if she continues to bad mouth you to your wife. And your wife needs to stop letting this woman lead her around by the nose so much. Olive doesn't see to her needs you do!", "YTA. She just magically got a high paying remote job like yours? \n\nTalk to your wife. She\u2019s the one with the problem, she keeps bringing it up and you\u2019re married to her. Stop focusing on Olive, it\u2019s easier to blame her than work on your marriage.", "I don't think Olive is the problem? Like...Natalie is a grown woman who can think for herself. She's the one choosing to share information about your finances with Olive. Olive may or may not be obsessed, but why is Natalie incapable of setting a boundary? I'm leaning YTA because I think you're addressing the wrong issue.", "NTA, she needs to mind her own business, have a serious conversation with your wife, she sounds like a toxic person to have a friendship with.", "NTA for the most. You manage your finance how you see fit. I earn a lot as well and I manage the finances because my husband is not so great at managing that. However, and this is the part where you could be TA, this is agreed between us.\nYou are married and supposed to share ressources or at least discuss how you handle it. Like have a proportional split of the expenses as if she is bringing 25% of the household money, then her contribution should be 25% of household expenses. Because if 75% of her earnings are going into the household then she can't save. Or you have to downgrade your lifestyle so she can afford to live on her earnings.\n\nYou need to talk to your wife and discuss what she wants and needs and come to a compromise on the family budget. This will spontaneously kick the third parties out if everybody is happy about the arrangement.", "NTA, but some of this was worded a bit AH; I always cringe a little when a dude uses crazy or insane to describe a woman, it sorta discredits your argument in my eyes a bit (I\u2019m also wondering if the bit about her getting a job to hurt your marriage is a fact or she just got a better job and you are reaching?) but either way you and your wife need therapy because if you feel the need to keep her out of your savings and not manage money with her than y\u2019all should probably talk about that- it feels wrong even if you have a fair justification.", "YTA - But, only because you\u2019re focusing your energy on the wrong person. This is an issue that needs to be addressed with your wife. It sounds like 1. your wife is discussing marital issues with her friend instead of you and 2. your wife is not fully on board with how you guys are managing your finances.", "I say YTA. \n\nBecause, and I don't know Olive obviously, but it's very possible that your wife IS confiding in her. After all, you literally wrote, \"For some mysterious reason, Natalie told Olive all about our finances during a night of drinking\". Perhaps it's no mysterious reason...Perhaps it was her feeling upset about the financial situation and feeling loose with alcohol among a friend. \n\n  \nAnd that Olive is simply giving your wife her perspective and advice when she does; especially because you said that arguments only happens when they go out together. You may wish to talk to your wife about how she feels before completely dismissing the fact that she may have some dissatisfaction with the way you handle your money, and begrudging Olive and accusing her of interfering with your marriage.", ">For that reason, she does not have access to my savings account. I make 3 times as much as Natalie and she is terrible at saving money, so almost all of the money in the savings account was put there by me.\n\nYTA.\n\nAlmost All? So not literally all? There is some of her money on your savings account that she doesn't have access too because you felt she was bad with money?\n\nIf your partner for the last few months for whatever reason has issues with this, why not offer her to go back to separate finances? So she can at least have access to her own savings account with her own money?\n\nSo how would she go about buying some new clothes now?\n\nOlive isn't the problem here. She may be an annoying loud mouth, but it's up to your wife to manage her frienschips and decide to either stick up for your relationship and not discuss finances with Olive, or to decide that her friend showed her a new perspective and she agrees with her friend, so she's comming to you to ask to renegotiate how you deal with your finances as a couple.\n\nRight now it sounds like you're claiming your wife is so weak-minded she's manipulated by Olive and has no right to agency over your shared finances, because she's not a capable? Why would you stay with someone if you honestly believed that to be the case? Unless of course you want to be able to manipulate the weak-minded one all by yourself and Olive is interfering.\n\nAlso thinking Olive would sabotage her own career just to 'manipulate' your wife, does indeed sound quite paranoia on your part.\n\nYou don't have an Olive problem. You have a wife problem. It sounds like she's unhappy about your current approach to dealing with finances. So sit down and figure out a new way that works for the both of you going forward.\n\nBlaming Olive as way to discredit your wifes desire for change, is AHish territory.  \n\n\nEdit: Got the names mixed up.", "[deleted]", "NTA.  A gentler way of approaching this would have had the same result.  Besides, as a married man, you should not invite another woman for coffee without your wife present.  Others may disagree with me on this, but that\u2019s how I was raised.\n\nyou are being very wise in how you handle the money.

You guys need therapy.  I\u2019d recommend both couples and individual therapy (that should ideally be three different therapists as the objectives are different).

How much debt did she previously rack up?", "It's probably because Olive makes such a big point of using her new high-paying job as a BIG reason why OP must bend to her oh-so-wondrous reasoning.", "No idea, but from OP comment Olive isn't put in a bad light even if that was the intention... She helped him \"at his lowest point\", \"checked on him all the time\" and then they drifted apart when \"he sorted his issues out\". It wouldn't be fair in me to make hypothesis. I can only say that his latest paragraph + him admittedly painting a good image of her as a friend of someone depressed makes me wonder if she wasn't the one being a bad friend. But it's only hypothesis and we never know. Maybe she was a bad friend. Maybe she was a good friend and they just drifted away. Maybe OP was a bad friend to her after getting her help.\n\nBut it could also be just different life experiences and bla bla. Usual things. It wouldn't be the first time that a couple is in a similar friends circle and at some point a friend become closer with the partner that they previously bonded less.", "He said she does not contribute to the savings at all.  As long as he pays as much as her into the household, I don\u2019t think this is the major argument to win the day.  \n\nBut OP needs to talk to his wife and work with her on a resolution they can both live with.  Also, they should both seek individual and marital counseling.  That gives Natalie a neutral third party to discuss it with and doesn\u2019t mean she cannot ask Olive, but the therapist may be in a better position to understand if Natalie\u2019s reliance on Olive\u2019s advice is problematic and then work with Natalie on that issue.  OP needs to communicate his concerns about Olive in therapy, because he should communicate all his concerns in therapy really.  But he needs to leave that alone and address marital issues directly with his wife (or talk to third parties as needed for perspective, not solutions, as he is doing here).", "A woman with objectively unhealthy spending habits likes talking to the friend who encourages her to spend more and demands she get access to more money to do so? Huh, wild.", "If they are co-mingled finances, OP needs to split them into individual accounts and make sure she has no access to his savings. \n\nOlive is giving a woman with a history of racking up credit card debt \"advice\" to spend even more. If you don't think that is unhinged, I don't know what to say lol.", "> But drawing a hard line in the sand with no communication or willingness to compromise is a marriage killer.\n\nIt seems OP has communicated to her that he prefers her to not have contact with her unhinged friend.\n\nSo her options are to agree to cutting Olive off, or going into counselling to determine a middle ground, or to carry on as she is. The ball is in her court.\n\nUntil such time as OP is comfortable with her response, he should cut her off from his share of the savings.", "There is nothing wrong with making a 100% unilateral decision to cut off a spouse who racks up credit card debt, is reckless with her spending, and also has an unhinged friend who encourages her to spend *even more*. Just because someone is in a marriage doesn't mean they shouldn't be looking out for their own financial interest.", "Agreed, but this is exactly why the problem is with Natalie - Olive's advice is aimed at levelling the playing field with a controlling husband, and taken from that point of view it was reasonable advice. She thinks that's the situation because Natalie hasn't told her of the debt she caused or that her spending was out of control and causing financial disaster for both of them.", "everyone here are so focused on your salary that they ignore this great financial mindset.\n\nfinance is also a huge factor in what makes or breaks a relationship. \n\nnow im only speaking on that one aspect, she needs to fix that.\n\nBut you being paranoid about how olive got her job is another issue that is on you..", "Yeah but you can still adhere to your current lifestyle and still do 75/25. That's not an excuse.\n\nShe could actually contribute to the savings if you divide it like that.", "- You need a financial advisor \n- You need a marriage counselor or a deep talk with your wife \n- Your wife needs to either wake up or go talk to someone about why she blows through money so quickly \n- You need to stop blaming Olive for things your wife is doing \n- Leave Olive out of everything", "You shouldn't be splitting bills 50/50 that's ridiculous you make 3x her and sound like you don't even like your wife", "\nYes I completely agree but I would also add a separate emergency Saving that they both have to put a present in that matches their income. I would put it in an account that requires both parties agreement in order for the money to be used. That way if an emergency happens there\u2019s non of the I used my saving already and we need to use yours instead they can use the emergency house saving while maintaining separate saving accounts.", "Yeah, this take is wild. I think it is financially abusive to spend beyond your means and take on debt that impairs your ability to contribute to your *joint* security with your partner.", "Kinda wild how many people are okay with a spouse cutting off their partner from their shared accounts.\n\nThe wife is unhappy with how things are. That's what this is about, why can't they have another conversation about their finances?", "Yeah, OP needs to talk with his wife, but til they reach a common ground he should give her part of the savings back to her and let she use it as she sees fit - if that means burning it all on crap he knows who he married and will have to decide if that's the future he wants.", "you're totally missing the point. OP has shared NOTHING about what he considers his wife's offenses to be. It's entirely possible that he's simply a controlling AH and his wife is the victim in this scenario--it's also possible that is wife gambles or spends family resources on drugs and/or alcohol or has a massive shopping addiction.  \n\n\nIt's like the Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat of finance, LOL.", "It is wrong to make you spouse put her savings in a savings account and blocking her from those money. It's basically stealing from her and could lead to huge financial abuse.", "Actually, no, no one should be making unilateral decisions over money that is a joined asset of the marriage. Which it is if they are married and haven't decided to keep their finances separate (in which case this post wouldn't exist). That just the legal answer and there're are no two ways about It. \n\nLeaving aside the legal aspect, he mentions the savings account is made up mostly (but not exclusevely) of money that he brings in. Contrario sensu, some of that money is brought by her wife and she has no practical access to it. \n\nMore over, as to the alegations of financial irresponsibility... They can a) very well be true, in which case op could and should keep their finances separate to protect himself or b) maybe he is exaggerating, and being excesively controling of his partner's finances. \n\nBottom line is you can't have it both ways: if you are married and have joined finances then every penny that enters the marriage belongs to both partners (independently of who mames what) and they should both, consensually, decide how to spend and or save. If you are not willing (or able, because one part is not mature/responsable enough) to do it, then you keep a separate assets and income regime. But then, you don't benefit from and control whatever (big or little) contribution your spouse makes to savings.", "Yeah I did some looking around and reread the post nobody is innocent except olive she's probably oblivious to what's really going on in the marriage.", "I think this is the best advice. Find a good financial planner who can help with budgeting and long range plans. And help keep Olive out of your business. \n\nI wish we\u2019d done something similar at your age. We\u2019d be in much better shape now \u2639\ufe0f", "You\u2019re right. As I wrote elsewhere, the best approach (given their different views on finances) is for them to separate finances entirely. \n\n- adjust their contributions to monthly shared expenses to reflect incomes (closer to 75/25 than 50/50) \n\n- open a savings account for her, with the total of her contributions to his savings account (fortunately, there are records of that)\n\n- keep their finances entirely separate \n\nThat way she has full access to do whatever she wants with his money, but no access to his money. With views that conflict so directly, \u201cshared\u201d savings is not a practical approach - every withdrawal by her is a direct cost to him. \n\nOf course, given her spending problems, I suspect she will object to this because she\u2019s more interested in access to his money than in access to hers. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but OP should find out either way.", "It\u2019s not a shared account, it\u2019s his savings account.", "OP has shared what he considers his wife's offences to be.\n\n> Natalie has a history of making bad financial decisions and racking up credit card debt.\n\n\n> I really don't think it's an accident that after every single night out, Natalie starts a fight with me about our finances.\n\nThese are valid reasons for OP to consider protecting his own finances from his wife. The first poses a risk of financial ruin and the second is a cause of mental stress that he does not have to take lying down.", "You are right. He says most of the money is his. He should transfer over her share of the money to her account and let her ruin her own finances. He should protect himself.", "Stealing is an overreach for sure, but you aren't wrong about the potential for it being a situation of financial abuse.", "> Actually, no, no one should be making unilateral decisions over money that is a joined asset of the marriage.
