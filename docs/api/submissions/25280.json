Before they came with us they had been in different families/ group homes for over a year. It was hard for luke to understand that they were with us for good and that he had his own bedroom and family. Me and my partner know that he stills sometimes has insecurities about it and a recent one was about him leaving for college. \n\n  \nWe explained to Luke that even if he was 18 and leaving the house he would still have a room and place at home, be it now or in 10/25 years. That he would still be our kid at 40 and we will always be here for him.\n\n  \nNow the issue. My cousin (F42) recently broke up and needed a somewhere to live for her and her two boys (M16/M12).\n\n  \nMe and my partner have a house big enough and we agreed to host them free of charge for 6 months until she gets her bearings back. For the house me and my partner have a kind of master bedroom with our bedroom, bathroom and office. Our boys have their own room and they share a bathroom and my cousin\u2019s boys have the guest room with a bathroom. My cousin has a room on the ground floor, it\u2019s not big but she has the space for a bed, a desk and a wardrobe.\n\n  \nLast week we got the keys for Luke\u2019s flat and we started the process of furnishing it, he will offically move in next week and will start uni the week after. \n\n  \nThis week end my cousin asked when Luke\u2019s room will be empty. I told her that it will not be, that he will only take his clothes, books, decorative items\u2026 basically his room will stay the same and he will take only what he wanted. She then asked how she will be able to move in the room with all his stuff still here. I told her she won\u2019t, that it will still be his bedroom. He will still come home on some week ends, holidays\u2026\n\n  \nShe then complained about the fact that she was living in a \u00ab storage room \u00bb, that she was the only one without her own bathroom and that it was unfair of us to have an empty bedroom in our house and not give it to her.\n\n  \nMe and my partner were very firm in our decision but my mom and aunt called and told me that it was a bit unfair of us to not offer proper accomodation for my cousin and that Luke could do without a room for a few months now that he has his flat for the school year. \n\n  \nI disagree, for me it\u2019s more than a bedroom it\u2019s what it represents. It\u2019s his own place for him in our home and it\u2019s something I want him to have for as long as possible.\n\n  \nI\u2019ve been called selfish and that I was coddling him too much over this so I would like an outsider percesptive.  \n", "created_utc": 1692737673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yia3h/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_sons_free_room_to_my/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hey, how about the woman who raised such an entitled person doesn't have room to criticize how you parent your own child. The kid was essentially told no one wanted him for the first 8 years of his life! God forbid you love the crap out of him.\n\nIf she doesn't like it, she can move in with your mom or aunt.

I'd sit down every person in the house and explain your decision. It will not matter if they agree.

It's very presumptuous of her to complain about the room you have generously provided for her.", "As a child who grew up ha jng an unstable life and no home to even go back to, I wish I had been taken in by parents like you.

I am so proud you for keeping that boundary with your family.\n\nYou are incredibly generous with your cousin and her children to provide a roof over her head.

Besides, it's your house, so it's your rules. And, she is getting it for free, so she isn't entitled to moan about it. On top of it, she does have a bedroom all for herself and her children also have a room.", "NTA-a million times over  -Your cousin is sure being demanding about a free place to stay. She does not get to be demanding when you were kind enough to house not only her, but her kids. If she does not like it, then she needs to find another place to stay. If your mom & aunt complain, then they need to house her. \n\nLuke has enough trauma in his life. His room represents love, respect and stability. I am glad you are doing this for him.", "NTA.

You are kind enough to let her stay RENT FREE she either agrees or she can go elsewhere.  The entitlement is OTT.  Might want to rethink if this will be a good idea.  If she is already making demands I am sure there will be more and you have no idea how her kids behave.  I vote NO don't let them in.", "Talk about selfish, it is the cousin who is selfish. She is getting a place rent-free, and she is telling you what she wants!!!! At that point, I would have told her she is not moving in. Let one of the other relatives take that ungrateful woman.

They don't get to say nothing about nothing in how you are helping your cousin out.", "NTA. If it's such an issue, your aunt or mom can have your cousin and her kids live with them. \n\nYou are doing her a favor.

It was only after college as we started on the next part of our life, did the bedrooms get switched up bit.\n\nYour cousin's room may be cramped, but they are only supposed to stay for six months, and their request to take over Luke's room is unreasonable.\n\nNTA", "Nta just keep asking the people who have a comment what time they would like you to drop off your cousin since they can do better. \n\nIt\u2019s special circumstances", "Nta. Your cousin sounds entitled. She's living with you rent free, surely it isn't forever? Your son however is welcome to a space on your home forever. \n\nI love that your son has a place that is his and will always be his. She and no one else has any right to tell you that's wrong.

If cousin doesn't like the accommodations that have been generously offered, she can go pay rent somewhere else or mooch off another relative.  She has a roof over her and her children's heads. You cave to one demand, you'll have to evict her later.  \n\nIf she's whining now, she doesn't plan on it being a few months.
