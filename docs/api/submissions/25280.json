Before they came with us they had been in different families/ group homes for over a year. It was hard for luke to understand that they were with us for good and that he had his own bedroom and family. Me and my partner know that he stills sometimes has insecurities about it and a recent one was about him leaving for college. \n\n  \nWe explained to Luke that even if he was 18 and leaving the house he would still have a room and place at home, be it now or in 10/25 years. That he would still be our kid at 40 and we will always be here for him.\n\n  \nNow the issue. My cousin (F42) recently broke up and needed a somewhere to live for her and her two boys (M16/M12).\n\n  \nMe and my partner have a house big enough and we agreed to host them free of charge for 6 months until she gets her bearings back. For the house me and my partner have a kind of master bedroom with our bedroom, bathroom and office. Our boys have their own room and they share a bathroom and my cousin\u2019s boys have the guest room with a bathroom. My cousin has a room on the ground floor, it\u2019s not big but she has the space for a bed, a desk and a wardrobe.\n\n  \nLast week we got the keys for Luke\u2019s flat and we started the process of furnishing it, he will offically move in next week and will start uni the week after. \n\n  \nThis week end my cousin asked when Luke\u2019s room will be empty. I told her that it will not be, that he will only take his clothes, books, decorative items\u2026 basically his room will stay the same and he will take only what he wanted. She then asked how she will be able to move in the room with all his stuff still here. I told her she won\u2019t, that it will still be his bedroom. He will still come home on some week ends, holidays\u2026\n\n  \nShe then complained about the fact that she was living in a \u00ab storage room \u00bb, that she was the only one without her own bathroom and that it was unfair of us to have an empty bedroom in our house and not give it to her.\n\n  \nMe and my partner were very firm in our decision but my mom and aunt called and told me that it was a bit unfair of us to not offer proper accomodation for my cousin and that Luke could do without a room for a few months now that he has his flat for the school year. \n\n  \nI disagree, for me it\u2019s more than a bedroom it\u2019s what it represents. It\u2019s his own place for him in our home and it\u2019s something I want him to have for as long as possible.\n\n  \nI\u2019ve been called selfish and that I was coddling him too much over this so I would like an outsider percesptive.  \n", "created_utc": 1692737673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yia3h/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_sons_free_room_to_my/", "score": 617, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are kind enough to let her stay RENT FREE she either agrees or she can go elsewhere.  The entitlement is OTT.  Might want to rethink if this will be a good idea.  If she is already making demands I am sure there will be more and you have no idea how her kids behave.  I vote NO don't let them in.", "Talk about selfish, it is the cousin who is selfish. She is getting a place rent-free, and she is telling you what she wants!!!! At that point, I would have told her she is not moving in. Let one of the other relatives take that ungrateful woman.

NTA.  All those family members with options need to open up their houses or zip it.", "If your cousin wants her own bathroom she can get her own damn house. Talk about choosy beggars.", "Definitely NTA your giving your cousin a free ride and she has the audacity to complain she\u2019s the asshole should be happy nothing wrong with asking about the room but once you said no that should be it.", "NTA. That room is VERY important to your son. It's his security and his tether. Knowing his foundation is secure will help him in adjusting to college.", "i think you are 100 percent nta", "Oh boy, that\u2019s rich! Self-entitlement at its finest, for all of them. You\u2019ve opened up your home, free of charge for 6 months, and they expect more? Let them go to a shelter and see what their options are there.", "NTA  Your cousin is free to go out and get any room she wants but in your house she will be staying in the one she has.", "NTA\nTell her to get the F out of your home and stand on her own 2 feet.\nShes staying for FREE and has the audacity to demand your sons bedroom knowing full well he had difficulties before settling with you lovely parents.\nShe\u2019s an entitled AH.", "NTA\n\nShe's staying for 6 months rent free to get back on her feet, sounds like she's trying to get too comfy.\n\nI'd be letting her know an end date to her stay & making her sign  a contract at this point, or telling mum & aunt she's moving in with them.", "NTA, send cousin and her children to live *for free* with her choice of your mother or the aunt. East peasy solution.", "You gave up your space for months to all of them. It is they who owe you, not vice-versa. Your son's room is off limits. If she doesn't like it, she can stay elsewhere. NTA.", "NTA - homegirl can move out and pay her own way, then, if she doesn't like HER FREE ROOM AND BOARD. My god.", "Tell her you are taking her advice and done coddling anyone. They had to fork over rent today or get out. \n\nWhat a spoiled entitled brat. \n\nNTA.", "Tell your mom and your aunt, in fact go out of your way and call them, that if they think that she needs to have her own bathroom they can freaking host her. You are doing her a favor, you\u2019re saving her six months of rent, if she\u2019s complaining she should GTFO. You are not the asshole, you are incredibly good person", "What\u2019s selfish is your cousin feeling entitled to someone else\u2019s room. \n\nGranted Luke won\u2019t be using it daily, but it\u2019s still HIS. given his past, that\u2019s not just a room to him. That\u2019s safety. \n\nI would tell your cousin she can either be grateful for the free accommodations for her and her 2 children or she can start looking for her own place immediately and be out by weeks end. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA and a phenomenal parent.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin is trying to bite the hand that feeds her. Tell your cousin and your family that if she has such an issue with it then she needs to speak to them about hosing her because you will not.\n\nIt also sounds very much like she has every intention to stay much longer than 6 months if she\u2019s having this much of a fit.", "Look at that. You found a choosy beggar in the wild. NTA. She has a lot of nerve. And your mom and aunt can take your cousin in if they are so invested.", "NTA - PLEASE don\u2019t let her use that room. She\u2019s fine and lucky that you\u2019ve been so generous.\n\nAnd don\u2019t try to explain it to her. Sounds like she is going to and cause drama over it. So the less you explain the better", "NTA and your cousin is being an ungrateful b***h. If your aunt and mom think you are being selfish, then one of them should put them up for 6 months (which you might want to get in writing because I agree she might be planning a longer stay).  You are obviously a good person and your cousin is trying to take advantage of that. Stand your ground because your son's feelings are what is important here.", "NTA", "Right? If she doesn\u2019t like the accommodations she can always, I don\u2019t know, LEAVE! How entitled to want the son\u2019s room when he will be back for weekends and knowing the history. \n\nNTA OP", "NTA, stand your ground firmly!   Two biggest reasons: 1-as stated, your promise to Luke.  And 2- I have a feeling that if she feels the need to uproot everyone or their belongings so she can have a bigger room, she is planning on staying with you longer than 6 months.\n\nSometimes a little inconvenience provides the impetus necessary to keep a short term stay just that - short.", "Im trying to tell you! Her sons have a room and she has one too but she\u2019s pissy she doesnt have her own bathroom and the room is small\ud83d\ude21maybe go see how you like the shelter, the boys can stay mom can gtfo. I do not play about my kids and OPs sons room is his safe place and shall remain so as it should as they agreed. The cousin and other fam can stfu.", "Same.\n\nOnce she called for reinforcements I\u2019d have rescinded my offer. \n\nIt\u2019s your house, you are the final arbiter of what the rooms are to be used for, you\u2019re being more than generous, and she has the audacity to look a gift horse in the mouth?\n\n\u201cMy decision is final, any further discussion will take place as I help you pack back up as you leave, are we clear?\u201d", "I was just saying the exact same thing. If she doesn't like the accomodations, she can find somewhere else and her kids can stay while she figures things out.\n\nOP is definitely NTA.", "Tell your mum/aunt to accommodate her. NTA", "Actually, OP can still do that, and should.", "Yeah, I hate it when people unleash the flying monkeys.", "Sister planning on getting a little bit too comfy", "100 percent she be out now. She can live with the flying monkeys.", "Talk about choosey beggars... they can get to steppin'", "I guess the mom and auntie both volunteered to host the cousin and her kids, since they aren't happy with OP deciding who gets what room in their house.", "Make sure that room has a lock. I can see cousin mincing in anyway", "Love that! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc01\ud83c\udf6a", "I agree with this tactic 100%. It does need to be a firm family conversation and stated that this will no longer be up for discussion. If this decision doesn't meet with cousin's approval, she is free to live elsewhere.", "Yeah, he'll need it when he comes home on weekends and during the Summer. It's not like he's gone forever.", "I would lose my shit on a nuclear level", "And give him a key!", "I also think she's planning on staying longer than 6 months.", "If she can establish residency, she can prolly make OP get a lawyer to evict her.", "She\u2019s pretty demanding for someone who\u2019s supposed to be focusing on saving up enough money to get her own damn place in 6 months.", "This is so infuriating! \n\nOP: this is my sons room. You can\u2019t have it, but here is a room -your own space- for free- and a room for your kids -for free. For 6 months. You don\u2019t have to pay us anything. \n\nFreeloader- that\u2019s not fair. I have a broom closet to live in! Gimme gimme gimme!\n\nOP\u2019s mom: you are being selfish OP!\n\nOP needs to turn around and tell mom, she can host 3 people for free and give them all their own rooms.", "Meanwhile in Europe every house has one bathroom\u2026", "HIS partner. They're both men", "You're right, thank you for the correction. I read the adoption ages respectively.", "OP is a guy, its a gay couple", "It\u2019s a shame but this is 100 percent why I would not let people live with me.", "Kinda sounds like she's planning to stay longer than that, doesn't it?", "Hell, growing up, we only had one bathroom for 5 people and the world continued to turn.", "Two if you're rich!", "I guess you mean mainland Europe? I'm in the UK and we have 2 bathrooms and one downstairs toilet in a family house... sure only one bathroom when it's just you or just you and your partner.", "Ugh. I still don\u2019t understand that.", "I don't think you can generalise the whole of Europe like that lmao", "In Ireland. How I dream of two bathrooms\u2026", "I can't even let people visit, it starts with a weekend and then they tell me it will be much longer. One person even tried for a month once.", "Think OP saved themselves here, think they'll stick to that 6 months if she feels like she's living in a closet!", "\"One time I was over there. One bathroom for nine people? And I never did see a toilet.\" \u2014The Brady Bunch Movie", "Right? Growing up we had six people living in a two bedroom apartment with one bathroom. My parents shared a room and my oldest sister had her own room. The rest of us shared a mattress on the floor. \n\nEventually we weren't as poor but we never had more than one bathroom even when we did eventually get our own rooms.", "We still do- it\u2019s pretty normal round here. Our house (UK) was built in 1890s- I don\u2019t think they ever expected everyone would need the bathroom at precisely the same time\u2026", "you were lucky, we used to live in one room all hundred and twenty-\nsix of us, no furniture, half the floor was missing, we used to huddle in one corner for fear of falling!", "I'm in Spain. Two bathrooms.", "It\u2019s a shame that people take advantage of you. Everyone thinks they are so entitled to everything you have."]}
