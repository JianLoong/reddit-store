Your mother was being spiteful. If you haven't already, explain to your grandparents and maybe other family members what has happened before she does. Perhaps go low contact with her, and tell her you want an apology and for her to respect your partner, alone with you have chosen her and love her.", "NTA.  You do not need a college degree to be successful.  Blue collar workers, such as plumbers and electricians, do very well for themselves.  Your mother is very ignorant if she thinks a college degree gives people their worth.  In addition, taking care of an entire household is pretty equitable to a single wage earner in terms of pulling one's weight.  As far as the comments about her not being talkative, your mother is free to not spend much time talking to her if they don't get along, but disparaging her without a good basis for it is unacceptable.\n\nIt is up your mother to be happy for you if your relationship is solid, not to insist on you having the type of partner that fits her ideals.", "NTA.  Your mother is being judgemental about something that is none of her business.", "NTA.  You have a tradwife by choice, and there is nothing wrong with that.  Your mother is an AH for insulting your wife.  Your grandparents asking you to apologize?  They are AH too.", "NTA.   \nBlock her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
