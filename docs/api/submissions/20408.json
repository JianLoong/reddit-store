When we met, we both had careers that we loved. We decided that when we had kids, I would be a SAHM until our youngest entered primary school and then I would return to work. This made the most sense because #1: he makes quite a lot more than I do, and #2: I just want to be at home with my babies for the early years.\n\nMy husband's current contract is almost up, and recruiters have been approaching him about other job opportunities. One particular opportunity is really appealing to him. He's described it as his dream job, and can't stop obsessing over it. I have to admit, it sounds amazing... other than the fact that it could not be in a worse possible location. It's unsafe, has terrible schools, and has no redeeming qualities other than the fact that the cost of living is low. If we moved here, we'd be able to save a lot of money for our kids' future college funds.\n\nI'm totally fine with the idea of relocating. In fact, I assumed we would since he's really burnt out with his current position and has expressed for awhile now that he doesn't want to renew his current contract. (He could if he wanted to). But I don't want him to stay in a role where he's unhappy. We also don't really have any ties to the place we're living in now. Our friends and families are spread out in various states across the country.\n\nThe issue is that I really don't want to relocate to \\[shithole-city\\]. He has received a lot of other offers in other locations, but none of the jobs have the benefits, perks, and salary of the one in \\[shithole-city\\] so he doesn't even want to consider them. I think he should consider them, and compromise on some of the things he wants, but he's adamant that he won't be happy with any other position.\n\nBefore you think I'm stuck up for not wanting to move to \\[shithole-city\\], let me just say that even the subreddit for this place actively discourages people from relocating there, and offers their condolences to new residents who have had to relocate there for work. It is NOT a good place to live.\n\nI told my husband that I refuse, and that there's no way in hell I would move there, especially when it's not our only option. He thinks I'm being unreasonable. AITA?\n\nEDIT: So far no one has guessed correctly. And the guesses are so far off. I doubt anyone has ever heard of this place unless they've lived there. Imagine WAY smaller. 1 school. No pre-schools. Barely any parks.  No recreational activities. 1 hospital that doesn't even have specialized care.

This would be stressful and you\u2019d need to use some of the extra money to take the household stress off if you. Housekeeper, babysitter/helper, etc.\n\nIs this someplace you could move to for 2  years before and that\u2019s it and what would you need to make it doable? Tricked out backyard for the kids?

If there is an illness, chronic condition, emergency?\nMy son broke his wrist, I had a massive choice of orthopedist to choose from. My friend whose son fell and broke his leg in a more rural area had a temporary leg splint and needed to wait 3 days to get the leg set and PT after was challenging to find, she ended up driving 2 hours each way for it. \n\nWhat is the maternity care like there? \n\nWhat kind of services are there for children/kids? If they are neurodivergent, what are the resources available?\n\nWhat kind of social structure life will there be for you as a family and you on your own?\n\nIs this a place that you think you\u2019ll be able to find like minded friends. Everyone doesn\u2019t need to fit the category. But it\u2019s important to have a group of people you sync with and feel safe to express opinions/views?\n\nIs it overly Religous area and does that fit in with your family. One of my sister moved to an area that was very Religous and social life revolved a lot around the which church you belonged to. Her daughter was 3 when she moved there and she was 6 months pregnant when she moved. Making friends took time for her, she\u2019s very outgoing and would even chat with people at the McDonalds play area, but following up was hard, because some, not all wouldn\u2019t want to make the time investment since she wasn\u2019t with their church.  \n\nAre you worried that being there will impact your mental health?\n\nWill your husband be working crazy hours and you\u2019ll be left alone a lot?\n\nIt is his career and I get him being excited and wanting the opportunity, but the move would have a big impact on the family and really needs to be looked at from how the family will be impacted as well.\n\nGood luck.\n\nNAH", "NAH.  A dream job can be worth tolerating a shithole city for, but I get the reluctance to move.\n\nThat said- the first time I told my mom I was looking at apartments in my current city, she was aghast that I would move to such a \"bad town\".  I won't like, my town does have a reputation, and there have been some pretty bad things happen here.  But I've genuinely never had a problem living here, and I'm very happy I moved.  Mom's even admitted she was wrong (a rarity!).  So I'm somewhat sus of your description of the place as a shithole without you telling us what it actually is.", "NTA, but is there a smallish city or town within decent commuting distance of sh\\*\\*hole city that might provide a doable solution to this problem?", "NAH.

You both have legitimate reasons for wanting to move there and not wanting to move there. How long will his contact be for? Why would you both not be able to move after this contract ends as well? Is there no safe part of this city? If your children are young enough, bad schools wouldn\u2019t really impact them (yet). \n\nThis is something you both need to sit down and talk about. Make pros and cons for the two best positions he was offered. His job decision should be something that makes him happy, but it shouldn\u2019t make you miserable either. \n\nAlso, calling a city a shit-hole just because YOU wouldn\u2019t live there seems a little shitty and assholish. There are people that call that place their home. Have a little respect, your privilege is showing.", "You're not an ahole, but I don't understand why you can't move to a location near the job. You could just go to a near city and drive your kids to a daycare/school in a safer location. You also seem a bit classist. NAH i guess. I just think that y'all can make a compromise for the children especially since you will be a sahm.", "NTA \nif it is as terrible and unsafe as you say then as a parent you have to think of safety of your kids. They shouldn\u2019t be raised in place where they cannot be without fear. And even you guys will not have peace of mind when kids go out to play to nearest park with friends etc. if you have a choice then choose good community/ city; it is soooo important.", "NTA. You both need to be on board for such a large relocation. You seem agreeable to going to another location, just not Shitty City. That seems fair that you both need to be on board.

This might be a bad sign but if he\u2019s more interested in working on his career than keeping his kids safe and getting the best education, then he may not be a good father. You should definitely ask him about it, don\u2019t sacrifice your kids for your husband\u2019s career.", "Was it your preference to be a SAHM with the kids while they are young children? Or is it that you could have gone either way (SAHM or work outside home)?\n\nThis is critical info because moving is a difficult decision that there isn't really a compromise you can split the difference on. Unfortunately you can't always pick the city that your dream job opportunity appears in. So the situations is take the dream job and move to shithole -vs- don't take a dream job and don't move to shithole.\n\nIn situations where you can't compromise I find it's important to find out which partner is getting their way more often in no-compromise decisions.\n\n1. If you get to work your dream job (being a mom and getting to spend tons of time with your young kids- which is hard work but what you want to do to cherish their childhoods) then you might need to make a concession and let him work his dream job, even if that comes with a less than desirable move.\n2. If you could have gone either way about being a SAHM, or if your preference was even to work outside home and you lost on this no compromise decision, then you should voice your sacrifice you've made for the family \n\nSituation 1 makes you kinda the AH because you tend to get and refuse to give, Situation 2 is a strong NAH.\n\nAlso, but I'm dying to know what city is shithole.
