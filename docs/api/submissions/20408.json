When we met, we both had careers that we loved. We decided that when we had kids, I would be a SAHM until our youngest entered primary school and then I would return to work. This made the most sense because #1: he makes quite a lot more than I do, and #2: I just want to be at home with my babies for the early years.\n\nMy husband's current contract is almost up, and recruiters have been approaching him about other job opportunities. One particular opportunity is really appealing to him. He's described it as his dream job, and can't stop obsessing over it. I have to admit, it sounds amazing... other than the fact that it could not be in a worse possible location. It's unsafe, has terrible schools, and has no redeeming qualities other than the fact that the cost of living is low. If we moved here, we'd be able to save a lot of money for our kids' future college funds. \n\nI'm totally fine with the idea of relocating. In fact, I assumed we would since he's really burnt out with his current position and has expressed for awhile now that he doesn't want to renew his current contract. (He could if he wanted to).

Our friends and families are spread out in various states across the country. \n\nThe issue is that I really don't want to relocate to \\[shithole-city\\]. He has received a lot of other offers in other locations, but none of the jobs have the benefits, perks, and salary of the one in \\[shithole-city\\] so he doesn't even want to consider them. I think he should consider them, and compromise on some of the things he wants, but he's adamant that he won't be happy with any other position.\n\nBefore you think I'm stuck up for not wanting to move to \\[shithole-city\\], let me just say that even the subreddit for this place actively discourages people from relocating there, and offers their condolences to new residents who have had to relocate there for work. It is NOT a good place to live. \n\nI told my husband that I refuse, and that there's no way in hell I would move there, especially when it's not our only option. He thinks I'm being unreasonable.

If they are neurodivergent, what are the resources available?\n\nWhat kind of social structure life will there be for you as a family and you on your own?\n\nIs this a place that you think you\u2019ll be able to find like minded friends. Everyone doesn\u2019t need to fit the category. But it\u2019s important to have a group of people you sync with and feel safe to express opinions/views?\n\nIs it overly Religous area and does that fit in with your family. One of my sister moved to an area that was very Religous and social life revolved a lot around the which church you belonged to. Her daughter was 3 when she moved there and she was 6 months pregnant when she moved. Making friends took time for her, she\u2019s very outgoing and would even chat with people at the McDonalds play area, but following up was hard, because some, not all wouldn\u2019t want to make the time investment since she wasn\u2019t with their church.  \n\nAre you worried that being there will impact your mental health?\n\nWill your husband be working crazy hours and you\u2019ll be left alone a lot?\n\nIt is his career and I get him being excited and wanting the opportunity, but the move would have a big impact on the family and really needs to be looked at from how the family will be impacted as well.\n\nGood luck.\n\nNAH", "NAH.  A dream job can be worth tolerating a shithole city for, but I get the reluctance to move.\n\nThat said- the first time I told my mom I was looking at apartments in my current city, she was aghast that I would move to such a \"bad town\".  I won't like, my town does have a reputation, and there have been some pretty bad things happen here.  But I've genuinely never had a problem living here, and I'm very happy I moved.  Mom's even admitted she was wrong (a rarity!).

You both have legitimate reasons for wanting to move there and not wanting to move there. How long will his contact be for? Why would you both not be able to move after this contract ends as well?

I just think that y'all can make a compromise for the children especially since you will be a sahm.", "NTA \nif it is as terrible and unsafe as you say then as a parent you have to think of safety of your kids.

This might be a bad sign but if he\u2019s more interested in working on his career than keeping his kids safe and getting the best education, then he may not be a good father.

Or is it that you could have gone either way (SAHM or work outside home)?\n\nThis is critical info because moving is a difficult decision that there isn't really a compromise you can split the difference on. Unfortunately you can't always pick the city that your dream job opportunity appears in. So the situations is take the dream job and move to shithole -vs- don't take a dream job and don't move to shithole.\n\nIn situations where you can't compromise I find it's important to find out which partner is getting their way more often in no-compromise decisions.\n\n1. If you get to work your dream job (being a mom and getting to spend tons of time with your young kids- which is hard work but what you want to do to cherish their childhoods) then you might need to make a concession and let him work his dream job, even if that comes with a less than desirable move.\n2. If you could have gone either way about being a SAHM, or if your preference was even to work outside home and you lost on this no compromise decision, then you should voice your sacrifice you've made for the family \n\nSituation 1 makes you kinda the AH because you tend to get and refuse to give, Situation 2 is a strong NAH.\n\nAlso, but I'm dying to know what city is shithole.

Who cares what some redditors say about this vague situation you've presented?\n\nBust out the pros-and-cons list. Call Jerry Springer. Spend a few minutes saying nice things about each other before jumping in. Take a flight to the city and drive around for a weekend. You gotta do something.", "The reason I feel like he is a little bit of an AH is because she\u2019s giving him plenty of reasons why she doesn\u2019t want to move to that city, and he keeps saying he won\u2019t be happy in any other job. To be honest, I feel like that\u2019s a little bit of a dick move.", "Husband wasn't an asshole for asking, but he IS an asshole for refusing to consider his family's needs and compromise. OP and their children would have a markedly worse quality of life if her husband takes this job, but he doesn't care because he'd get what he wants.", "He's not budging though. that's why he's at fault. This is divorce territory in my opinion. He will resent her if she digs in her heels (the way I would) and she will rightfully resent him if she agrees to nice their kids to such a place.", "What was your city?  Can you tell?", "Info: how long has he been interested in this type of job?", "She doesn\u2019t. Just because a city isn\u2019t safe doesn\u2019t make it a shit-hole. It just makes it unsafe. She has the privilege of getting to choose where she lives. So, just because she wouldn\u2019t live there doesn\u2019t make it a shit-hole city.", "no it's classist to call the place a \"shithole-city\". Obviously don't move you're children to the hood and if the schools in the area are bad don't take them there, but insulting the city and by extension, the people who live there is the issue.", "Usually, isolated towns aren't full of crime so I don't think I can fully imagine what issue you have. I used to stay in a VERY small town with a bad school and honestly, I flourished in the school because it was easy to pass the classes and get on teams and that gave me many things to put on my college applications. The district was poor enough to where no one was allowed to bring lunch, all the food was free to give you an idea of the school. There was also a strong sense of community. If it's so small and you see many poor qualities about the area maybe you could become an active member in the city and start making positive changes. You don't have to go and I don't think you're wrong for wanting a more populated city. I personally prefer bigger cities, I just think you shouldn't judge the town for being poor.", "i know right? im dying to know so i can weigh in lol", "Portland maybe?", "ooh good guess! i was thinking Detroit", "We did discuss this before having kids and we were in agreement about what we wanted. But things change. Priorities change.", "A 2 year old is only a couple years away from starting preschool. They\u2019re not years away from needing a good school district at all.", "The two year old isn\u2019t too far off from starting school. I started at 3, so the school being shitty argument does matter. The safety of the area matters. The only thing that is a positive about the area is the amount of money they can save and the husband\u2019s job perks, everything else, everything that affects OP and the kids on a daily basis, is a negative. Only one person out of four will be having positives on a daily basis, and that isn\u2019t either of the kids.", "An isolated shithole city that happens to have amazing career opportunities for her husband is one I am having trouble picturing.", "Fr, Id love to see which \"shithole city\" has no suburb to exurb to live in", "So very isolated craphole. \n\nWell, you could make a hard and fast compromise with your husband that you will go there only if he promises to relocate in 3-5 yrs when the kids start school. In the meantime, live frugally despite the low COL and bank all those perks, because it will be hard to buy back into a nicer area when you're ready. If you have to, sorry to be practical, put money on the side yourself if you have to leave his selfish ass behind in 5 years.", "He's willing to move when I'm ready to return to work as long as it aligns with when his contract is up. The first contract is for 5 years, and I believe after that it's a year to year type of contract.", "I'm all for 'take a flight to the city and drive around for a weekend' angle. Not saying people aren't telling the truth about the area but I could easily find 100 people who hate living where I live. And I live in Hawaii!!", "I dont think her reasoning is valid. Where in the world is there a 'shithole city' with no livable suburb or exurb for families? It simply doesnt exist. Even Gary IN (Reddit's punching bag) has neighborhoods to live in for a nice QOL", "Since college. It's the same type of job he has now, and it's the same type of job he can get anywhere else. It just has way more perks and benefits than he could find elsewhere.", "i think she probably has a good reason to call it a shithole, as read above. she\u2019s not making a moral judgement lmfao", "I'm 100% not judging the town for being poor. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Usually, isolated towns aren't full of crime so I don't think I can fully imagine what issue you have.\n\nIt's very crime ridden. I wish I could give more details, but it would very likely reveal which city I'm talking about.\n\n>There was also a strong sense of community.\n\nThis is actually one of my major issues with it. There's no sense of community. It doesn't have that same type of small town charm that you're describing. I would be more than happy to move to a small town like that. But this isn't that.", "I see a lot of guesses in the comments. I would genuinely LOVE to move to any of those places over this one. To consider those places shitty over this one is so laughable. \n\nLet's just say it's not a place anyone has ever heard of unless you've lived there. I was surprised they even had a subreddit.", "I would move to Portland,Oregon in a heartbeat.", "Why on earth would you guess Portland. Portland is a perfectly fine place to live", "Gary, Indiana was my guess.", "Yep. And there are no pre-schools here. None. Unless you count someone who has no background in teaching or working with children who is conducting an in-home faith-based \"pre-school.\"", "Possibly Los Santos? Maybe Vice City? Liberty City?", "I don't know if OP has made it clear what country they are even in but one place that comes to mind is Fort McMurray, AB.\n\nSome people who live and/or grew up there will defend it as being a great place to live but the reality is it's an O&G town full of transient workers and almost no-one would live there if not for the good money. It's roughly 3-4 hours from the nearest major city and a lot of the small towns between those two places are generally terrible.\n\nThe problem is that the money and job opportunities *can* be extremely good, but that's about it. Every time work takes me there I wonder why anyone would choose to live there other than for the money that the patch brings.", "Imao it's Vegas. Probably the huge data centers nearby.", "This is exactly what we're leaning towards. His contract is for 5 years. And 5 years is about how much longer I'll need before I decide to return to work. He said he'd be willing to relocate again once I'm ready to start working again. \n\nBut five years in a crap hole is still such a long time. Especially as a new mom with no friends/family. I already feel so isolated.", "Five years? 2 or 3 maybe but you would have young kids with no entertainment that isn't you for FIVE YEARS?! Don't do it,  NTA", "He is setting you up. It is being made clear to you that your career and happiness are not his priority. I understand that your career took the backseat because you wanted to raise your kids, but he's telling you now that he's make you stay home longer if it inconvenienced him.", "We went. The recruiter flew us out there so he could schmooze my husband. My husband and I are actually in agreement on how shitty this place is. He just can't get over how perfect this job is for him. I think the shittiness outweighs all of that and he doesn't.", "Just because you don\u2019t know doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist. Anecdotal evidence isn\u2019t evidence. It sounds like she did her research.", "Well the perks are likely because no-one will take the job because the place is so awful. They\u2019re just hoping if they throw enough money at it they\u2019ll get someone.", "Info: How would this move impact his career long term? Is there another route to getting these same perks and benefits?", "Well, I'd argue that considering the education system not good enough for her children is a judgment. like, do you think the town is dumb or something?", "Look, I can keep a secret. What city are you talking about? I want to see the subreddit.", "It's definitely Gary, Indiana lmaoooo", "Too much fox news makes people think Portland is some kind of warzone", "Gary, Indiana would be paradise compared to where I'm talking about.", "San Francisco was my guess...its a shithole now", "Lmaooooo\n\nNah definitely Gotham.", "Diamond City. Just a hop and a skip from Concord, so it has to be good.", "Lol I was thinking prince george\n\nBut Fort McMurray is another plausible one for sure", "Can't be the Mac, she said COL was low", "Actually I think she said in a comment that it\u2019s a small town, which makes even less sense. Unless it\u2019s a small isolated town adjacent to a prison and he\u2019s being offered a job as a warden??", "hey op i think something you could bring up to your husband is the fact that youd be moving either pregnant or with a small infant and another child - would you have a support system there?", "Does he care about you or the kids or is it only about him? My parents were willing to be apart with my dad working in a city in a different country where the local women were notorious for willing to be the mistress as a way to escape poverty if there wasn't a school for me and my sisters.", "It sounds like she has a personal vendetta against the city in question and won\u2019t elaborate further because of it", "I loved growing up in my hometown. I was homeschooled, but fully aware that the school system there was absolutely TERRIBLE. It isn't necessarily a reflection of the people living there, but it sure as hell means I wouldn't move back there if my kid had to go to that school", "> do you think the town is dumb or something?\n\nI'm gonna get flamed for this for sure... but tbh, yes? I think anyone who chooses to live here when they could live somewhere else with the same perks (low cost of living, etc) is pretty damn dumb. Imagine a small town with none of the perks of small-town living except for it being dirt cheap.", "\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026What?", "I'm sorry, but the state of public schools in most areas aren't really great. Everyone wants the best for their child and I will not even have children if I cannot afford a great private school for them.\n\nIt is not moral judgement at all.", "probably Gary, Indians", "Is that place so bad?", "But they still have nice suburbs. She says the next livable city is 3 hours away. \n\nI guess that knocks out Gary too though... Chicago is only an hour away and there's a whole pile of suburbs in between.", "Does that mean metropolis is the liveable city because that place is a dump", "I mean, might be relative if they're currently living somewhere more expensive...", "My guess is oil. Maybe he's an engineer or project manager. A family member (who is a senior engineer for an oil company) just moved to shithole, North Dakota and is making $$$$$ - but I think fully intends to leave in pretty short order.", "It could be. OPs are known to be unreliable story tellers, but we\u2019re not tasked with determining if they\u2019re telling the truth. We just assume they\u2019re telling the truth, and respond accordingly. If she does have some random issue with the city, that would change my opinion potentially, but the fact is if one person in a marriage doesn\u2019t want to move to a city, then it needs to be discussed further.", "I guess my pov is a little biased. The town I grew up in not only had a terrible school system but there was borderline corruption. It's doing better now, but the state took over and everything got messed up, many teachers quit, and there was a new superintendent every year. It was actually pretty interesting, but all that didn't equate to academic success. I personally was still successful, but some students weren't. It honestly just depended on how motivated kids were though.", "Alright. If that's your pov. I haven't seen the town, but if you truly don't think that's where your children shouldn't be then don't take them there. I still think you are classist, but NTA still.", "That\u2019s what makes you classist. There are definitely people that live there, that don\u2019t have the choice. They don\u2019t have husbands that can support them and their wants like you do. They are probably surviving the best they can. That doesn\u2019t make them dumb. You can not like a city without insulting it and everyone living in it. You\u2019re an asshole just for the way you talk about the city and the people in it.", "To be fair, Chicago is becoming (has become?) an unsafe, shit-hole city as well. But the suburbs are still nice enough. For now.", "Chicago is great. Maybe you should lay off the Fox News (or at least the conservative anti-city biased news sources).", "Dude, I lived in Chicago for 3 years. I now live a couple hours away cuz Chicago is a mess. Literally 6 months ago I had a friend visiting the Science and Industry museum. SHE WAS STABBED. And robbed. Over 30 stitches and she had to have part of her intestine removed. 3 weeks in the hospital. Chicago may be \u201cgreat\u201d, but it is definite not safe. 256 people have been FATALLY shot this year so far in Chicago. Chicago also has one of the lowest literacy rates in the Midwest. Businesses are leaving because of the constant theft. Need I continue? Also, I don\u2019t watch Fox News."]}
