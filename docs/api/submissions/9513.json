Only America has this fixation on labelling people.", "I believe a key difference between someone who's black in the USA, and the UK, is that if you grew up in the UK, it's likely you still have family alive that immigrated, so you know your family origins.\n\nVery few White Brits know their origins without doing a DNA test to see what kind of Norman/Anglo-Saxon/Viking/Beaker-folk they are - so they lump it all into 'White British'\n\nAs you said, the slave trade destroyed the cultural link most Black Americans have with their past.", "I don\u2019t think you know what cultural appropriation is.", "Is it something they promote like one great-grandparent being 1/8 Irish?", " Your friend is probably an idiot, please encourage him to never leave the States,", "Also, not every black person is from Africa.

There is also the fact that a huge proportion of our black population came to the UK in the last 100 years, by choice rather than forced abduction.\n\nThey don't feel like they can associate with native Africans, but they don't feel they fit in the box of just American. And it'll probably be several more generations of closing the gap before they consider the \"othering\" of the term to be as absurd as we do.\n\nWhile there are many Black Americans who have come around to finding the term at best incorrect, there are many other who consider it a core component of their identity and cannot even fathom just being \"Black\".", "It's also rocky considering there's a whole race group in South Africa called coloureds, and in America, they think of the word as a slur but coloured people hate being called black", ">would that make Elon Musk an African American?\n\nThat's a good point, never thought about that! \n\nAlso, your answer to him was hilarious and you're absolutely NTA. sometimes im baffled by American stupidity.

They define their culture by the immigrant group their ancestors come from because those groups do have different subcultures within the US. Whereas in Europe we define culture differently. It's more about where you grow up and how you've been socialized, which language you speak. That makes sense in the European context because borders have changed so much, people have moved all over the place for centuries. We're all just mutts anyway.
