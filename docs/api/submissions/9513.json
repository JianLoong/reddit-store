Yes it's common to say \"African American\" in the US but it's completely silly to say that to you as a British person. And saying someone is \"black\" in the U.S. is not politically incorrect, if anything it is more accurate to reflect the broad experiences of black people and not just those in the American context. For someone to try to explain blackness to you is... well... stupid, and offensive.\n\nI think you had a pretty funny retort to him and I think he's just mad you outplayed him.", "NTA- love the clap back and as an American I apologize for that AH American.

He's not just an asshole, he's an ignorant asshole. You're not American and if you prefer to identify as Black instead of African, he doesn't get to tell you that you're wrong.", "Lmao", "NTA -- you presumably know what you are better than he does. And if you're not American at all, then you can't be anything-American, whatever convoluted reasoning he's come up with.\n\nIt sounds as if he's at least gotten the message about how not to define you (though maybe not how *to* define you, depending on how you feel about 'British African') so, since he has conceded the point, I'm not sure what he thinks you should be apologizing for. I would stop trying to avoid him, and the next time he insinuates anything, tell him matter of factly, \"You seem to be suggesting that you want an apology from me, but I'm not sure what for.\" Let him try to explain exactly what he thinks you did wrong when he's the one who has already admitted that you were right about the point itself (which you can remind him of if necessary).", "NTA - So weird!

I might even file a complaint... maybe... IDK your roommate, but... \n\nUgh, it just feels really ick. I'd tell someone, at the very least.

He's made up his mind, it's not your job to try to educate someone who has decided this is who you are. Especially one you would be friends with. \n\nThese type of people are the ones that will still insist they are right despite showing them evidence to prove they are wrong - once you realise that, don't give this type of people anymore of your time.

When I was a kid my mom always told me you couldnt say black and that you had to say African American and that calling a black person a black person was racist. \nMy theory is that roommate's brain eventually just used African American as a replacement for saying black without ever actually thinking about the individual words and then was embarrassed and angry for having been embarrassed.
