Your dad and mom are frail and vulnerable- and to be blunt they could pass leading to a painful break in your extended family.

You don\u2019t have to condone or forgive your mom\u2019s behavior, but I think cutting your parents off when they are ill and under so much stress is an action that will lead to more harm/regret.

I also saw her so scared of being sick and her own mortality and so vulnerable and I think that is what made me think of the ideal of mercy when I read your post. Your mom must be scared about your dad\u2019s heart and the loss of her sister. I think while your family is under such stress it might serve you to  lift the no contact - definitely don\u2019t say you forgive or in anyway excuse what happened- but as they say in bad business meetings- put a pin in it and circle back when things are calmer.", "I am so sorry. <3", "we were not talking about my child at all except for a brief mention that they were having their wisdom teeth out the day before the event. and that had been mentioned at least a half hour earlier. my mom is a button pusher and knew exactly how to attack me. I have talked with my child about what happened. at issue is they are very much the I-need-to-keep-my-head-down-so-no-one-feels-the-need-to-bully-me-more kind of person and there is certainly a power differential between them and a grandparent. so they are more worried about how grandma\u2019s feelings might be hurt than thinking about themself.", "totally fair and I appreciate your thoughts. my initial response, after all these years of being told she has a bad memory, is it not on her to a) get checked out and/or b) admit she might not be remembering the situation correctly?", "I really appreciate your thoughts. thank you!", "I beg to differ. yes, some politicians are actively trying to hurt my child. do you know how many anti-trans laws are being proposed around the US right now?", "And yet, by dead naming a CHILD her mother has put him in exactly that position.", "I think you are wise and truly appreciate your thoughts and perspective.", "This is a tough one .... having recently lost a parent (80) I will say that it just doesn\u2019t matter when they are gone. What has happened can no longer be made right. What\u2019s loss cannot be restored. You are going need to decide what you can live with.

Until she is diagnosed it is just an excuse.", "Possibly. I have worked in healthcare for 20 years. Its really not that easy. Nobody wants to admit they have memory issues. The thought of forgetting ourselves and others is terrifying... More so than cancer, AIDS, etc combined. I've seen so many people unalive themselves when finding out they will eventually forget everything. Literally over 100 patients in 20 yrs. (I was an EMT and MA). Its unfortunate but reality. Does she seek medical care otherwise? Or is she someone who avoids the DR unless she feels she's in danger? I absolutely get your point. I do. My favorite cousin is trans. And i do all I can for him. We have a relative with severe dementia who is 1000 times worse than your mom.
