For additional context, my father is insanely religious and Christian. \n\nMy plan was to live at home and go to school and work until 2024 but now I\u2019m trying to get out of this house as soon as possible. My father was alright with this plan, he\u2019s the one who supported it. I pay $200 a month in rent and I work in an elder home kitchen as a server. I typically work Monday through Friday, 9-6:30, but lately, I\u2019ve been picking up more hours because I can\u2019t stand to be home. I have a boyfriend and on my days off, typically the weekends, I go out and drive 30 minutes to his apartment because my father refuses to meet him, much less have him in the house. I digress. Two weeks ago I was talking about how I was leaving on Saturday to hang out with him, and my father just said \u201cNo you\u2019re not. No more Saturday\u2019s for you, you\u2019re not allowed to leave the house on sabbath for any reason now.\u201d \n\nRemember that religious bit? Long story short, my father has gone off the deep end into the Bible and despite us being Christian (me leaning away from the faith now) we do sabbath on Saturday\u2019s and whatnot. And because I missed the deadline for college admissions due to lack of communication from my former high school I\u2019m only working full time. But I\u2019m also trying to save money to get a roommate and apartment so I can move out before my step mother gives birth my sibling. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole. Yesterday my father and I got into a fight because while yesterday was my first day off in a while, I was doing errands and getting my car fixed up, and I mentioned how tomorrow (today) I\u2019d be doing my chores and how I picked up a closing shift (4 hours) because people called off and my boss asked me to. My father popped off how I am absolutely NOT leaving the house and how if I want to continue staying at such a low rent rate then I need to cancel on my boss or else I\u2019d be forced to pay him my whole paycheck. I yelled at him that Saturday was my only real day off but that I was going to be doing my chores anyway and how I didn\u2019t have time to just sit around and read the Bible and listen to him spew on and on how I\u2019m a dirty sinner and going to hell, and how I deserve respect too because I\u2019m an adult just like his is. \n\nToday I\u2019m still doing my chores but he keeps saying how I\u2019m such a disrespectful jerk and that if I go to work later tonight then I better expect to be paying almost $600 in rent now. My step mom is trying to talk to him but I\u2019m just so tired of him and his preaching. Am I really the asshole here?

It can be a painful, oppressive environment. I hope you can find strength in your own sense of self \ud83d\udc9b", "I never really saw it as abuse\u2026 I mean at first I thought he was just mixed up and trying to \u201cprotect Me\u201d in his own way cause he\u2019s said that so much but when he started threatening higher rent and whatnot I started realizing he was going too far", "This \ud83d\udcaf...run", "He doesn\u2019t believe in therapy, I go myself to therapy and he hates it, he\u2019s tried multiple times to stop me from going but he gave up after the last time when I walked damn near 7 miles to get to my appointment", "HR asked me to spot the difference between those scenarios, but there no difference. They're the same thing.", "THIS!!! You are their free babysitter + diaper money. Get out as soon as possible even if you have to rent with several roommates. It will never get easier to leave; only harder.", "I think it\u2019s more control than the baby because he\u2019s always been threatening to charge me higher rent whenever I \u201cget out of line\u201d or say something he doesn\u2019t agree with. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s purposely trying to sabotage me, but I think he got mixed up in his head and thinks he\u2019s protecting me from the world in a way. I\u2019d rather believe that than him actively sabotaging", "Thing is, it is STILL actively sabotaging you, for the sake of control. It's a form of financial abuse. The abuser will use money to regain/retain dominance. \n\nI'm praying that you will be ok. Your life is YOUR'S to live. Do so on your terms."]}
