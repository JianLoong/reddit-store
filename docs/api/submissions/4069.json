YTA not for the intent, but for the delivery. \"You look great in your pictures, but in person, wow!\" You thought you were complimenting her in-person looks, but the way you said it comes off as insulting her appearance in the pictures.

They didn't couch the compliment in with \"yeah other people are just faking how they look\"\n\nAlso, I would have gotten my hackles up if the line sounded disingenuous, because it seems like a neg. Again, the \"it always seems to be the other way around\u201d part of the comment is really just a dickish thing to say. Hearing that, I would have stayed for dinner, but would have told you after I'm not interested in dating further.\n\nWithout better context on how the conversation was going - this one *is* hard to tell. At the least its NSH, but seems more like YTA", "So.....as a woman I can definitely say she either heard \"you take bad pics\" or she heard \"i will insult women in general in order to compliment the one im dating\".....either way its not sounding good for you", "YTA. You're telling her \"Wow most ***feeeEEEeeemales these days are always so catfishy!*** I'm surprised you weren't malicious at heart given you're a *woman on Tinder*\". Do you actually think that there is ANY WOMAN who would take that as a compliment?", "YTA this is a backhanded compliment. Were you trying to neg her?", "I guess the compliment could have been delievered differently.. Maybe more like \"I have to say you're even more beautiful in person\" or something like that. I would have reacted different but because I would have heared a normal compliment and not a backhanded one. \n\nI don't know if you know about the The 4 Ears Model? I's a communication model developed by Friedemann Schulz von Thun. It states that everyone who communicates with another person conveys four messages to their interlocutor: A message on the matter level, a self-disclosure, a message on the relationship level and an appeal.\n\nHere an example of what I mean:\n\nExample : \"The traffic light is green!\"  \nLet's start with an example that comes from the book Talking to Each Other by Schulz von Thun.   \nA woman is driving a car, a man is sitting next to her as a passenger. The two of them stand at the red light and wait. The light turns green and the man says \"It's green\".   \nSo the man is the sender, the woman the receiver of the message.  \nLet's look at what four messages the man wants to convey with his statement:  \nFactual level: \"The light is now green.\"  \nSelf-revelation: \"I'm in a hurry.\"  \nRelationship: \"I drive better than you.\"  \nAppeal: \"Drive now!\"\n\n  \nNow let's look at how the woman takes the message.  \nFactual level: \"The light is green.\"  \nSelf-revelation: \"You are too slow.\"  \nRelational: \"You're a bad driver.\"  \nAppeal: \"Next time let me drive again\".  \n\n\nIt's really interessting to look at. We learn this in School actually. Helps a lot especially if you remember it \\^\\^", "I met a girl like that. Her pictures were cute but when I saw her in person, she was breath taking.

The only time a guy didn't offend me saying this is because he said it like,  \"you're even more sexy in person then you are in your pics\". Idk just landed better.

Rule of thumb:  if you mention appearance, only mention it in a complimentary way, and never compare it to anything else.  Comparisons can only come off as fake or insulting, stay away from all comparisons!", "\"A woman's mind is as complex as the contents of her handbag\".\n\nI think it was a nice compliment, but it could be taken the wrong way. \n\nThat being said, if the date was going great and she got up mediately after that?

I wouldn't have gone on a date with at least 50% of them if their pictures had been honest and they wasted both of our times. \n\nSo people who online date enough start tk just assume everyone is a little worse looking than their photos and decide whether you're attracted to them enough to go on a date. \n\nI photograph poorly.  I had a LOT of men say that about me (that I was better in person) and even women outside of dating who had first known of me through pictures posted by mutual friends to social media. I never took offense -- I know I photograph poorly.", "NAH.

I had many people tell me in my life I look even prettier in person. When me and my bf met after dating 6 months online  we were both speechless when we saw each other. I said to him I knew you were attractive but seeing you in person you are way more attractive than I thought and he said he knew I was pretty but did not know I was this pretty.\n\nI personally don't see it as a backhanded compliment.

That negates the intended compliment.", "I learned from the day I got married that marriage is compromise. I give up some things I want, she gives up some things she wants. Because in the end, us being together is better than anything else that we individually wanted. \n\nAlso, \"old school\" may be one word. I think forgiving is a better one. My wife is a very independent woman, but she chooses to stay with me. And I her. The problem with people today, my generation especially (I'm 25), is that everyone takes every slight as a direct insult on their personal existence. Why? Because they have no bearing on what a person is anymore. We are human.

I have no way of knowing how you behave around homeless people, or what your views on anything are besides gender relations. And for that, you have said enough to get a feel.  Keep your faux deep condescending philosophical musings around \"my generation\" - it is deeply patronising, and trite. You are \"simply human\" but you also have some deeply disrespectful and unpleasant views of women. I fail to see why I should treat that with compassion.", "> rarely in writing\n\nText is modern writing, and people use it in text conversations all the time.", "So we are only going to use formal terminology? \n\nSo instead of saying \"I have a pet dog\" you should say, \"this is the canine that resides at my property\"", "You're changing the goalposts from \"its a compliment\" to \"speaking his truth\".

To presume so is quite patronising in and of itself. The homeless comment was in response to you saying you can't know someone from a 5 second clip. I'm saying sure, I can't know everything about you, but I can tell your views of women and gender relations from what you've said here.  \n\n\n I'm merely stating that your views are demeaning to women, and that your wife is not the be all and end all of what women want. Stating the obvious is not being frustrated. But you're right, we aren't getting anywhere.

It doesn't mean that negging isn't a word. In fact, it explicitly says that it is \"words and phrases\". Things being informal doesn't mean they don't exist.

Women should be treated exactly like men in society. We are all the same. Shitty women get treated like shitty men. No separation. Also, women should be drafted. \n\nYou seem to think that women are above men, and that there is a double standard for how men should act towards women. My wife \"trained me\" is a jest. We took the time to learn each other. \n\nThe fact that you judge people so quickly is part of your failure.

I'm talking about subconscious views as well as your stated ones. Thinking \"this is why men don't want to get married\" or \"women can't take compliments anymore\" is to harken back to older eras where women were treated even worse than they are today. To have such reactions to people calling out your views is to belie a certain defensiveness.  I don't think women are above men. But I think society is deeply sexist to both men and women and that is ingrained in all of us.   \n\n\nThe training \"joke\" is a case in point. I'm sorry your views and values are so unexamined, truly I am. To live life without critical cross referencing your underlying assumptions would be truly limiting. \n\n>I really hope one day you can truly examine someone else's view without becoming so defensive.\n\nIronically I hope you find the same. You have resorted to cheap shots, called me a failure and 'frustrated' (again, a sexist trope used against women), rather than directly responding to any point is indicative either of someone who doesn't know how to constructively engage, or who does not want to. So I wish for you to grow beyond the arrogance and condescension you seem to feel for the world."]}
