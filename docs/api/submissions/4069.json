YTA not for the intent, but for the delivery. \"You look great in your pictures, but in person, wow!\" You thought you were complimenting her in-person looks, but the way you said it comes off as insulting her appearance in the pictures.

They didn't couch the compliment in with \"yeah other people are just faking how they look\"\n\nAlso, I would have gotten my hackles up if the line sounded disingenuous, because it seems like a neg. Again, the \"it always seems to be the other way around\u201d part of the comment is really just a dickish thing to say. Hearing that, I would have stayed for dinner, but would have told you after I'm not interested in dating further.\n\nWithout better context on how the conversation was going - this one *is* hard to tell. At the least its NSH, but seems more like YTA", "So.....as a woman I can definitely say she either heard \"you take bad pics\" or she heard \"i will insult women in general in order to compliment the one im dating\".....either way its not sounding good for you", "YTA. You're telling her \"Wow most ***feeeEEEeeemales these days are always so catfishy!*** I'm surprised you weren't malicious at heart given you're a *woman on Tinder*\". Do you actually think that there is ANY WOMAN who would take that as a compliment?", "YTA this is a backhanded compliment. Were you trying to neg her?", "I guess the compliment could have been delievered differently.. Maybe more like \"I have to say you're even more beautiful in person\" or something like that. I would have reacted different but because I would have heared a normal compliment and not a backhanded one. \n\nI don't know if you know about the The 4 Ears Model? I's a communication model developed by Friedemann Schulz von Thun. It states that everyone who communicates with another person conveys four messages to their interlocutor: A message on the matter level, a self-disclosure, a message on the relationship level and an appeal.\n\nHere an example of what I mean:\n\nExample : \"The traffic light is green!\"  \nLet's start with an example that comes from the book Talking to Each Other by Schulz von Thun.   \nA woman is driving a car, a man is sitting next to her as a passenger. The two of them stand at the red light and wait. The light turns green and the man says \"It's green\".   \nSo the man is the sender, the woman the receiver of the message.  \nLet's look at what four messages the man wants to convey with his statement:  \nFactual level: \"The light is now green.\"  \nSelf-revelation: \"I'm in a hurry.\"  \nRelationship: \"I drive better than you.\"  \nAppeal: \"Drive now!\"\n\n  \nNow let's look at how the woman takes the message.  \nFactual level: \"The light is green.\"  \nSelf-revelation: \"You are too slow.\"  \nRelational: \"You're a bad driver.\"  \nAppeal: \"Next time let me drive again\".  \n\n\nIt's really interessting to look at. We learn this in School actually. Helps a lot especially if you remember it \\^\\^", "I met a girl like that. Her pictures were cute but when I saw her in person, she was breath taking.

The only time a guy didn't offend me saying this is because he said it like,  \"you're even more sexy in person then you are in your pics\". Idk just landed better.

Rule of thumb:  if you mention appearance, only mention it in a complimentary way, and never compare it to anything else.  Comparisons can only come off as fake or insulting, stay away from all comparisons!", "\"A woman's mind is as complex as the contents of her handbag\".\n\nI think it was a nice compliment, but it could be taken the wrong way. \n\nThat being said, if the date was going great and she got up mediately after that?

I wouldn't have gone on a date with at least 50% of them if their pictures had been honest and they wasted both of our times. \n\nSo people who online date enough start tk just assume everyone is a little worse looking than their photos and decide whether you're attracted to them enough to go on a date. \n\nI photograph poorly.  I had a LOT of men say that about me (that I was better in person) and even women outside of dating who had first known of me through pictures posted by mutual friends to social media. I never took offense -- I know I photograph poorly.", "NAH.

I had many people tell me in my life I look even prettier in person. When me and my bf met after dating 6 months online  we were both speechless when we saw each other. I said to him I knew you were attractive but seeing you in person you are way more attractive than I thought and he said he knew I was pretty but did not know I was this pretty.\n\nI personally don't see it as a backhanded compliment.

Talking about a sweater in a sincere way and saying it looks comfortable, say at work, or getting coffee with your girlfriends, is probably safe because a sweater can still be nice but also soft and warm.", "If you genuinely mean it as a compliment, that usually comes through. I have both enthusiastically given and received this compliment (usually about sweaters), but if I\u2019m just going about my day in a no effort casual outfit and someone tells me I look comfortable, that\u2019s when I\u2019m going to get insulted. It sounds more like a dig about not dressing up than genuine delight about my leggings.", "Exactly, it's when she is obviously dressed up. Saying her outfit looks comfortable is then used to say \"You didn't put much effort into your appearance.\" And I do think it makes a difference whether it comes from someone who is romantically/sexually interested in you.", "Context. If you're meeting a friend at the movies \"those pants look so comfortable\" is totally appropriate, if someone dresses up for a date and you tell them that their best red dress \"looks pretty comfy\" you're dismissing the effort they put into their appearance.", "I don\u2019t think OP meant it in that way at all, but to me it definitely comes across as negging. The comment feels ambiguous as to whether he is mainly complimenting her looks or insulting her pictures. He also didn\u2019t add any unequivocally positive feedback in the comment \u2013 he doesn\u2019t even say that she\u2019s pretty, he just says that she\u2019s better in person than in pictures. The way he compares her to other women is also typical for these kinds of backhanded pickup lines, bearing the implication that she needs to prove to him that she\u2019s special, because the baseline \u2013 women in general \u2013 is beneath him. \n\nI absolutely do not believe this is what OP meant to communicate at all, I think it\u2019s just a case of really unfortunate phrasing that probably triggered her because of previous experiences with interactions like that. It certainly triggered some of my memories. And even if you decide to give him the benefit of the doubt, once you start worrying about whether you\u2019re being manipulated or not, it\u2019s super difficult to relax and enjoy the date.\n\nHe should have phrased it better, and she should have given him a second to explain himself.", "It's wasn't neg on purpose, but it sure felt that way.", "Sure, but that's why he's asking what happened. There was clearly bad communication from OP's thoughts to words. People make mistakes. Doesn't mean consequences disappear", "\"I'm just blown away that she wasn't a catfish\"\n\nRiiiiiiight", "Lmao exactly. Also that doesn\u2019t even make sense. Why would OP agree to go on a date with her if he thought she looked bad in her pictures?", "That's one of the stupid takes to ever existed.", "Do they let angsty fifteen yearolds who want to show how smart they are compared to other fifteen yearolds who use slang and less punctuation teach?\n\nWhat school is that desperate for teachers?", ">If he didn\u2019t think that her pictures looked good, why would he have agreed to go on a date with her?\n\nThe assumption she'd most likely make here is that he wasn't really into her, and was just hoping to score.", "Based on the catfishing comments desperation on his part.", "I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s so hard or so triggering to compliment a person without attacking anyone including their own past self. It\u2019s not a big ask. It\u2019s not demanding. And yet be nice without being mean seems that hard for you? I can\u2019t help you here. But damn.", "And that\u2019s fair - maybe we all need to be a bit better at giving (and frankly, receiving) compliments\n\nBut that said - applying so much negativity to each and every comment made by every person and seeing everything only in a negative lens is not a good idea to go through like. I get that it\u2019s why forums like these and Reddit itself sometimes exist - but it goes too far", "Then at that point, how does this just not apply to everyone? Because it's still an insult", "Wow dude.", "Or you\u2019ll shoot an eye out\u2026", "Honestly I\u2019m a guy and if I ever shoot my shot and get turned down in the back of my mind I might think the girl I asked is gae (if insulted I apologize) but I\u2019ll be gracious and won\u2019t be a jerk about it I\u2019m tired of dumb thick headed meat heads thinking any girl will jump at the chance to date them it\u2019s infuriating because not all guys are like that", "We don\u2019t want the men to come running, we want to run away from the men.", "Ehh idc how much you\u2019ve supposedly dated. Just because it\u2019s been a lot it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve been successful. It also doesn\u2019t mean you still can\u2019t have incel-type ideologies, which clearly you do because you felt the need to condescend this person as if them being a woman disqualifies then from knowing better when it comes to what women may be looking for in dating.\n\nIdk where you got that last part from but I never said that lmao. Maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019ve been on more dates \u201cthan you care to\u201d because you don\u2019t know how to listen.", "Just because we don't pounce every time our looks are complimented doesn't mean we want to hear about our looks. And just because women have been gracious listening to your objectification of them, doesn't mean that they enjoyed hearing it. How are you going to tell women what our experience is?", "...this would go straight over my head lol. I never wear heels, maybe that's why? The one guy who tried to get me to wear heels promptly was dragged to a shoe store and presented a pair of pumps. \n\nBut after reading your explanation I get it and I do feel like this tactic has been used against me, hmm...", "tbf when you\u2019re on tinder and match with a very attractive woman there\u2019s like a 95% chance she\u2019s a bot or a catfish. OP is still stupid for how they said the compliment but I don\u2019t think he was purposefully trying to insult her.", "You do realize that people go on dates with other people even if they don\u2019t find them the most attractive or even attractive at all because they like their personality and they have chemistry. Physical appearance isn\u2019t the most important thing for a LOT of people.", "I don\u2019t understand why people always jump to the worst possible conclusions\u2026", "Not really, it just means that he\u2019s had negative experiences in the past", "Oh yeah, I forgot to say.. it is definitely my opinion that walking out was a bit much..\n\nIt was a poorly thought out comment, but idk if it was \u201cwalk out of a date\u201d worthy\n\nOP says the date was going well up to that point.. unless OP just has no clue how to read people (which tbf is something supported by him making this post in the first place), I find it very strange behavior to walk out on an otherwise good date over one tacky comment - but again, OP is an unreliable narrator so who knows how it really went down", "Some people are much more photogenic", "And in this age. Most pictures (especially on dating sites) are touched up and posed to be the \"best\". So to be prettier than your pics is a compliment and rare.", "Damn so many half zingers. Being a woman and saying what you did about women shows where you stand in the stack of women, and why I dont care what you say and don\u2019t think other young men would benefit from listening to you. \n\n- a successful man", "So apparently his behaviour can be excused because he's been catfished but she can't respond negatively to a repeated pattern of behaviour?", "Online dating can be a minefield.  We often assume the worst because of how often we've actually seen the worst.\n\nOP jumped to a pretty bad conclusion too... He was \"blown away that she wasn't a catfish\".", "Because why do y'all care about appearances if it's for love? It doesn't sound like you want to be with *someone*, you want to be with someone *pretty*. It's insulting. You don't care about anything else because nothing else *is* coming up in your comments", "Oh it's very simple\n\n\u2615\ufe0f", "Obviously we all makes mistakes, but dosn't absolve as from being assholes. \nSure it's not as bad as kidnapping a child or something, but it's still a shitty thing to do, even by accident.", "Yes. Bur please go.into the complete scientific name of your canine.", "It was clearly a casual, well-intentioned comment, she was the one who reacted negatively", "\"A repeated pattern of behavior\" can be deserving of a negative reaction when it's ONE individual who has repeated a bad behavior multiple times.  A bunch of different people each doing a bad behavior once isn't the same.", "Exactly.", "People generally like being complimented on their appearance. Also, I\u2019m just giving this guy the benefit of the doubt, not because I think beauty is everything. It clearly seemed like he made a well-intentioned comment that this girl blew out of proportion.", "Then you should understand that using words the wrong way gives off the wrong impression. There's a reason why are considerate of *how* you say things. Like how is this your argument?", "You don't get to pick what comment lands. People have their own thoughts and feelings. You don't know what this woman has even gone through for her to drop the date so quickly. Y'all don't think about anything passed fuckin pictures", "So same applies to this man. You don\u2019t know what he\u2019s been through. Maybe he\u2019s been catfished by multiple women. Who knows?"]}
