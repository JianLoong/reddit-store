She should at least respect how your family feels about it and it isn\u2019t even that big of a deal to not keep the book on display.", "You're not upset about a history book; you, a person of Jewish faith, are upset about the obvious Nazi symbol she refuses to put anywhere except in plain sight within your own home.   \n\n\nHonestly, I would be somewhat alarmed by a partner who 1) dismisses such an obvious faux pas as \"unreasonable,\" and 2) is digging their heels in on a subject that means absolutely nothing to her but so, so much to you and your family. Why is she turning this into a fight?\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's a very small request, for an understandable reason. Ask her again, or make sure you hide it yourself before your mom visits.", "NTA. Why is keeping the book elsewhere or covering the swasthika such a hard thing to do?", "NTA\n\nAs a Jewish person I'd be upset enough that she pushed back at all to consider ending the relationship. It's not about the contents of the book. It's about her fundamental disrespect for your family's lived experience as Jewish people, in a world where in 2023 antisemitism and violence against Jews is still on the rise worldwide on a daily basis. \n\nBecause here's the thing: she doesn't seem to have explained why it's \"unreasonable\" or why they \"shouldn't be upset\" about the book. And literally any remotely history-literate person I know could give her reasons off the top of her head why it is ABSOLUTELY REASONABLE for a Jewish person to be upset at having to see a large Nazi symbol in front of them in what is supposed to be a safe, friendly environment. What isn't reasonable is the fact that it seems to be important enough to your GF to display that book that she is arguing about it. I can't think of a single reason for that. I'd loooove to hear her justification, though. \n\nIn the meantime, if for some unfathomable reason you want to continue to date this woman, I'd suggest that the next gift you get her be a couple of books on generational trauma and the history of Jew hatred that goes back literally thousands of years and spans the entire planet, long before the Nazis or the Holocaust. Then ask her again why she thinks she's entitled to tell us what we \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" find traumatising.", "NTA\n\nshe's coming off rather insensitive.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not Jewish and I would be uncomfortable with a book like that on someone\u2019s coffee table.", "**NTA**\n\nI have this exact book and the swastika is certainly not subtle. The fact that there's absolutely visual context in the image around the swastika makes it uncomfortable for me to display too prominently as well. So I don't think you're being unreasonable, especially given your guests, to want it out of sight.\n\nYour girlfriend is actively reading this book though, and if your regular practice is to leave books out that you're reading for convenience, I don't think she's being an AH necessarily, but she's being disingenuous if she doesn't understand why people would be uncomfortable with its display. It's not treating your GF like a guest though for her to be mindful of the guests you have over to the house especially when it's a simple accommodation.", "The only correct response from the girlfriend would be something like, \u201cOh, my goodness, of course I\u2019ll cover it! I can completely understand why the image on the cover would be upsetting.\u201d\n\nShe seems insensitive and uncaring", "NTA.\n\nThey aren't \"upset about a history book\" and your girlfriend is either willfully blind or lacking in emotional intelligence and empathy if she thinks the problem is merely \"a history book\".  The problem is having to look at and endure the sustained presence with a symbol used by people who committed horrific acts of terror and the generational trauma that triggers in a place that should otherwise be a place of comfort and ease (i.e. someone's home - in this case the home of a loved one).  You expect to see swatiskas while visiting a history museum with exhibits on WWII and can avoid it accordingly if you wish.  You don't expect to see it on a coffee table while having tea and a visit with your family.  It honestly isn't that unreasonable, nor is it that difficult to just put the book on a shelf or in a drawer when you're not actively reading it.", "NTA at all. She should absolutely understand why the symbol is offensive, and you've offered very reasonable compromises. You're not infringing on her reading at all, but don't want to display a symbol of hate in your home.\n\nShe's TA for considering that \"unreasonable.\" Come on.", "NTA. I'm Jewish, and I've read the book. (Great book, but look up some of the commentary by newer historians afterwards. There have been a lot of changes in German Historiography in the near-eighty years since the end of the war.) The problem is context. When I lived in Japan, I thought it was supremely silly that Europeans and Americans would get upset when they saw the similar-but-not-exact swastika, the kind used for centuries, marking Buddhist temples on Japanese tourist maps. On the other hand, I get a bit chilly when I see the hakenkruz in a Nazi context. I don't think it should be censored in historical documents and discussions, but I personally removed the slipcover from my book when I read it. It's like the difference between a Christian Cross on the steeple of a Black-majority church, and one burning on the front lawn.", "NTA. Your family's request is not an overbearing one. Fact is, the swastika can be visibly upsetting to Jewish people (even in just a historical learning context). I find it ironic that your girlfriend is interested in learning about the Nazis but then claims Jewish people shouldn't be uncomfortable about seeing the hate symbol. She might want to flip through a few chapters and get to the concentration camps part because something isn't sinking in with her history lesson.", "I am a reader, I have a lot of books. I have an interest in history so I had several books about WW2 and the Holocaust, including Rise and Fall. Several have a swastika on the cover. Early in my dating relationship with my now-wife, she nervously asked me if there was something I needed to tell her. Turns out, she was afraid that I was a neo-nazi. I am very much not. NTA, swastikas are unnerving for a reason.", "NTA, your girlfriend arguing that you (A Jewish woman) should not be upset over a fucking swastika is absurd and out of pocket. \n\nThat is extremely fucking stupid and rude of her. Honestly I don't know that she's not reading the book in a pro nazi way if she's that comfortable having a hate symbol displayed in your house.", "I own that book and the cover makes me uncomfortable.  NTA at all.", "I mean, this is a fairly temporary problem. Can't you just do a 30-second walk through of the living room and put the book away before your family comes over?", "If she can't understand why a swastika is upsetting to your family, what other micro aggressions and acts of antisemitism is she likely to commit? Ask her to explain to you why the swastika is upsetting. Her answer is likely to be insightful for you. Because if she completely downplays the impact of the Holocaust on the Jews even today, then she doesn't need to be reading that book. She needs to be reading things like \"People Love Dead Jews,\" \"Why the Jews\" and watch Ken Burns' documentary about the American response to the Holocaust. And maybe listen to the podcast Jew Ought Know, especially the season about the formation of the state of Israel where he talks about how Jews were blocked from escaping Europe and fleeing to Eratz Israel to escape the Nazis. \nYou are NTA and she most certainly is.", "NTA. A book cover is easy to do, especially for a symbol that thanks to millions of horrific tortures and murders rightly brings out strong emotions in the would-be victims.", "I'm surprised, for being such a history buff, that she doesn't understand why someone might be uncomfortable around seeing a swastika. NTA", "NTA Your GF is being insensitive to yours and your family's feelings. Make a stipulation to your GF. If she wants to stay with you in your house she needs to put that book away when your family and Jewish friends come to visit. If she refuses ask yourself do you really want a future with someone like that and then give her a move out date.", "Tell her to cover the fucking book with the big swastika on it that is offensive as shit. She don't like. Gtfo!!!\n\n\nNTA", "NTA there's a reason as a Jewish person I don't trust ww2 history buffs", "NTA\n\nYou're asking that she put it away when guests are present, this is not at all an unreasonable or onerous request.", "Absolutely NTA. Anyone can see why that would be offensive, intent or not.", "NTA you're not asking for a lot. Can't someone just stick a post it note on top of the symbol.", "NTA. \n\nShe should respect your concerns as your partner, but she should be even more aware because your family is Jewish. The problem isn't what she's reading, it's the discomfort the symbol causes your family.", "For someone who likes to read about history, your GF is incredibly dense. NTA.", "NTA. I rarely comment on AITA, but I\u2019m a historian who studies Nazi Germany and the Holocaust for a living, so I have LOTS of books with covers like that. However, I keep them put away because other people don\u2019t like seeing them and I don\u2019t necessarily like seeing them all the time either. I would do that for anyone who was uncomfortable with them, but especially for someone who\u2019s Jewish! I get that she wants to avoid pretending like the Third Reich didn\u2019t happen, but she also needs to be respectful when people express their discomfort with the imagery, and it takes zero effort to put the book away or put something over the cover.", "NTA\nYour gf is completely insensitive. I'm not Jewish or anything close (in fact I'm from German descent) but a book with a huge swastika on it would just casually sitting on a coffee table would make me uncomfortable. I can't even imagine how your visiting family feels.", "Lol I was reading a coverless piece of a book a couple weeks ago, and my BiL asked what book it was. It was Inside the Third Reich by Albert Speer, Hitler\u2019s Architect. He asked why it was just a chunk of a book. I explained that there were swastikas on the front and back cover and so I removed them so I could read it in public. But I lied. The truth is I break my paperbacks into hundred page sections so I can carry that days reading in my back pocket without feeling lumpy. I\u2019m literally worse than Hitler.", "NTA for not wanting to upset your guests with the symbol on the cover of the book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mom placed her book in a drawer. You're asking her to put the book elsewhere. You mentioned in this post that you own the house.\n\nI understand your question IATA, but I'm wondering (like your apparently), for your GF, is it about your house being her home too now? Is it about you choosing your family over her?\n\nDoes your GF really realize it is just about the cover of this book?\n\nYou might want to communicate with her about that instead of asking us.", "NTA. Can\u2019t she just flip it over so that the cover is facedown?", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI read a lot of true crime books, and some of them have horrible covers.  I don't leave that shit out when I have company over.", "This is kind of concerning. You made a very reasonable, very simple and inconsequential request. You explained your reasons, which even the most dense person could understand...let alone one learning about what transpired during WW2. Instead of complying because she has the brain power to recognise the symbol can be triggering to a Jewish person, she's feigning ignorance. 'It's just a history book, dude!'. \n\nTo summarise, she's a bit shit.", "NTA", "NTA but the gf is horribly insensitive. Is she always like that? Yikes.", "NTA. What you're asking for is such a simple request. A simple request that would make someone else feel much better. Of course she should agree to it. You're family are Jewish!

I do however keep it on my bedside table and not in my living room.", "Yta unless your mother and sister lived in Eastern Europe during the 30s and 40s. It\u2019s just a shape you give it meaning. She lives there as well guests should abide not the other way around.", "YTA. She should feel free to read a history book in her own home and should not have to hide it.", "NTA. It's easy to wrap a book and hide its cover.", "Sorry, this looks like it will be an unpopular opinion, but YTA. This book is a classic, award-winning work that is not even remotely anti-Semitic in nature. Context is everything, and the fact that you have a girlfriend who is reading this book should make you\u2014and your family\u2014proud of her.", "NTA. This is a very small ask of your girlfriend. Her response is unreasonable. I assume your family isn\u2019t upset she\u2019s reading the book but uncomfortable sitting it front of Nazi imagery. Why can\u2019t the book be set aside when your family comes to visit?", "NTA they make dust covers and book jackets specifically for this. Your girlfriend is just being obtuse for no reason (and I'm saying this as someone who has loads of books I don't really want other people to see me reading). \n\nEven if your family wasn't personally uncomfortable with it, it's still just common courtesy to put a book with a particularly startling cover out of the way or covering it when other people come over.", "Ask your girlfriend if she were Black, would she be comfortable with a history book about the Middle Passage with a photo of African slaves chained together on a ship as your coffee table book? If she wants to read her book, that's fine, but a book with a giant swastika doesn't need to be a coffee table book. As a Jewish person, I would have little patience explaining to a non-Jew why this would be an issue.", "NTA, your girlfriend is being very insensitive.", "YTA. Move the book when you know your familiy is visiting. No need to move it when they are not around .", "Wow. This is a tough one.

It's a simple ask to put the book away when they come over--- and the fact that she's making it a \"thing\" is worrisome.  Good luck and you are NTA here but your GF is definitely in AH territory.", "NTA. It's a small thing anyway (a symbol on a book).

Her doubling down is a red flag. \n\nOn one hand, she's right that it's a history book that is not pro-naxi, but on the other hand, she's in a relationship with a Jewish partner... And we're not that far removed from the Holocaust. And (assuming you're in the US) we're facing a rise in fascist/pro-nazi beliefs.

And I like history, which is full of enslavement and holocaust of various peoples and other general atrocities, so there\u2019s a chance ANY of my reading material *in my home* is offensive to *someone* and I have to cover all my books, depending on when my partner has unexpected guests. \n\nLike a book in my own home left where I was last reading it, in my own home, shouldn\u2019t be a federal case.

She could stick the book in a drawer, or flip the book face down, or set another book on top of it, or put a post-it note over the swastika, or place some opaque tape over the swastika, or whip up a book cover out of plain paper \u2013 that's just off the top of my head, and at the absolute maximum, the most time-consuming of those options (making a book cover) would require her to invest *maybe* five minutes of time and effort, and require paper, scissors, and some tape. The fact that she's digging in her heels and resisting doing anything at all makes her a huge AH, and makes me wonder if maybe she *is* trying to display a swastika, because if she weren't, she'd be willing to flip the damn thing over, stick it in a drawer, stick a post-it on the cover, or something else along those lines.", "It would literally take her less than a second to turn the book over every time she puts it down or to put a sticky note over the swastika once.", "We dont let people murder us and destroy our homes and businesses we don't fucking want that to happen", "Read the room.

It's not like the difference between an actual gun and a picture of a gun. A swastika is the specific formation of some lines and if drawn on a toilet wall with a sharpie or with a stick on beach sand, it is all swastika.\n\nI come from a place where this is a religious symbol for us. If someone drew it on the road with chalk, people won't step on it, as it is stil the swastika and thus auspicious. The same with the negative connotations of the Nazi swastika. It is still traumatising for people victimised by Nazism.", "It's literally an actual, physical swastika on display. \n\n\"So what\" that this is a symbol of a regime that murdered my close relatives and wanted nothing more than to stop me from being born?", "Because seeing a swastika can remind people of how their parents or grandparents were tortured, abused, and genocided during the holocaust?

I just want to make sure I understand in case I\u2019m in a similar situation in future.  I figured that it being a book, and people generally being open to discussion, would mitigate any feelings of discomfort, but perhaps I\u2019m wrong.", "I think there is difference in context between a swastika drawn on a toilet wall and one appearing on the cover of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.

The book having a swastika on the cover is not a problem given the subject matter. The problem is refusing to consider the relatively reasonable request of guests when the compromises are quite simple (cover it, turn it over habitually, put it away, and so on).", "They're Jewish though, they don't need to engage in critical thinking here, theres no discussion needed, they know what it's about. \n\nIt upsets guests to see it. It sets their minds to thinking about harsh topics that they're not looking to wallow in during a casual visit. Off the top of my head I can think of a few things like that that would upset me, I definitely wouldn't have them displayed so openly in my home, so OP is being reasonable here.\n\nIt's a book, so it's so easy to just turn it upside down or stick it in a drawer. Theres no reason to upset your guests like that, when you get absolutely nothing out of doing so."]}
