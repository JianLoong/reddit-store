It\u2019s literally empty except for me and 4 other passengers. So last minute this guy comes on, looks around for a while, and then asks to sit beside me. Quickly thinking to myself that I don\u2019t wanna be stuck beside a stranger for 4 hours when I don\u2019t have to be, I get up from my seat and tell him to go ahead, in the nicest way possible.. I then move a couple of seats behind the row I was sitting at. He gives me a really dirty look then and when I was getting off the bus, he rolled his eyes at me. Oh, also it\u2019s a direct bus by the way, there was no stops along the way. \n\nI understand that my actions probably seemed very rude, but I just honestly didn\u2019t feel like sitting beside a stranger for that length of time, when the bus was basically empty. Like it\u2019s nice to stretch yourself out on a journey that long and not have to mind someone else\u2019s personal space, and I also didn\u2019t feel like talking. But I feel guilty thinking I offended him or upset him, like the more I think of it the more guilty I feel. He obviously wanted someone to talk to but if it was a short journey I would\u2019ve , but I didn\u2019t wanna be stuck with him to find out he\u2019s a weirdo and then make it more awkward by *then* moving after talking to him. But then I still have the nagging feeling I was rude or could\u2019ve hurt him, and his facial expression\u2019s definitely implied it anyway. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: thanks for all the replies, I really appreciate it them and feeling a lot less guilty! \u2665\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1667338858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjm8ss/aita_for_moving_seats_when_a_man_asked_to_sit/", "score": 7104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You do not owe this man or anyone else a conversation or someone to talk to. There were empty seats and he was being obnoxious by trying to sit with you. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA - if there were plenty of seats to choose from then he chose to sit next to you on purpose. It's weird to choose to sit next to someone on a bus when it's empty, most people choose empty rows until forced otherwise. It's a bit creepy tbh, I would have done the same thing", "NTA. You aren't required to be nice to anyone. Especially someone who decided to sit next to you, with a nearly empty bus, for 4 hours.

I\u2019m immunocompromised and once at urgent care, this unmasked couple with a dog sat right next to me, so of course I moved a few seats over. They proceeded to stare daggers at me.

Again, would that have made me a bad person?\n\nThis man doesn\u2019t know your story, he doesn\u2019t know your health status, he doesn\u2019t know anything about you. Why should he be mad at someone for not wanting to sit by a complete stranger?", "NTA. Remember, you don't have to feel to guilty when you push back against men who feel entitled to your time, space and energy.

You should have zero guilt. His issues are not your issues.", "NTA nothing good was going to come from that. \nYou held your boundary politely.

Why on earth would he choose to sit directly beside you when there were tons of empty seats?

He probably wanted to trap you for 4 hours. You were smart to move", "NTA. it's fine for him to want company. It's fine for you to not want company.

Gross.", "NTA. The fact that he was visibly upset with you for moving is all the proof you need that he was at best entitled to your space and time, at worst planning to harass you.

There was absolutely nothing wrong with you moving to a seat where you would be more comfortable.", "NTA. Don't worry about offending someone that tries that stunt. He sure doesn't care if he offends you. Better that you moved when you did, then attempt to get up five minutes later.", "Slight AH, you were unnecessarily rude, you could just say you'd rather be alone.", "NTA he had no reason to choose the seat he did unless it was to chat you up or feel you up.

You will never see him again so no worries", "I had this happen to me on a city bus once. A super overweight guy just had to sit next to me instead of one of the empty rows. I had a lot of bags and couldn\u2019t move away quickly, so I let him sit because I didn\u2019t want to cause a whole thing. Well he proceeded to pressing his hand against my leg in the weirdest way for the next few stops until he finally got off. I\u2019m not even sure it was sexual but I felt absolutely uncomfortable and trapped, won\u2019t forget about it for years. And that was a few minutes, not a 4 hour bus ride. You absolutely did the right thing. Never doubt yourself for making sure you can feel safe. Feelings of creeps come second by far. NTA", "NTA.  He was being creepy.  You don't have to worry about hurting random men's feelings when they're giving you unwanted attention.  Be civil and polite (unless that doesn't work) but don't spend one second worrying about whether you hurt the feelings of some creepy guy on the bus.", "NTA. Don't let a stranger \"trap\" you (I assume he wanted to sit in the aisle seat so it would be difficult for you to leave after he sat down.", "NTA.  Dude was a creeper and was just pissed that his \"plan\" didn't work.  You should definitely have moved away.

Trust your instincts every time.", "If I were in your position the only thing I would have done differently, is giving him the finger when he was giving out his dirty looks. \n\nI am sad/mad that society is guilting women to feel apologetic for making sure that they are safe.

NTA", "NTA. Feel free to take all of that guilt and just let it go. Women are conditioned to ignore their instincts in favour of being 'polite' and keeping the peace but you were smart not to do so. I think you handled the situation very gracefully. At best, he may have simply wanted to chat your ear off for 4 hours but he could have also become creepy, handsy and/or invasive. His reaction makes me suspect the latter. Never regret protecting yourself!", "He had no reason to sit next to you, plenty of seat available.\n\nIf you felt uncomfortable sitting next to him, then you had every right say no or move to another seat.\n\nThis sounds off to me him and I believe if you have a concern or feel unsafe, the people to change/move from others. \n\nIf May be nothing would have happened but the risk is always there and one time you don\u2019t listen to yourself could that tune something happens", "NTA, I feel like the equivalent of this is when there are like 5 urinals and you're using the one in the end and someone comes in and stands next to you lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He came back in the next day and because I was still new at the time, I made the mistake of saying \u201cOh and did you want [special instructions] like yesterday?\u201d because I get excited when baristas/servers remember my order and I thought that would be the case, but no. He just got this weird look in his eyes and immediately started hitting on me because I guess he thought the fact that I remembered his order meant I was into him. That was all well and good. But THEN, for the next month, every single shift I worked, no matter the time of day (it would switch up a lot), he was there EVERY single time. Without fail. And only for me; this wasn\u2019t true for the other baristas. I don\u2019t know how he knew what times I would work but other baristas started noticing and the second they saw him come in they would tell me to go hide in the back. It was so bad I almost considered transferring to a different store.

We got placed into a room in a dark corner. We went inside the room to check it out and I noticed it had no deadbolt; the only lock it had was just a regular lock and I\u2019m very sure the manager that checked us in probably had a master key that he could use to open it. Maybe I was overthinking it given how much Criminal Minds I watch, but I REFUSED to stay in the room. My friend I was traveling with kept telling me I was overreacting and nothing was going to happen and she wanted to stay in the room because we spent money on it, but I simply refused to go to the room. She only agreed to leave when I told her I\u2019d reimburse her for the money she would lose because the motel had a very strict no refunds policy. To this day I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t go back.

I (37M) was pumped because I never got the chance to see it in theaters the first time around, which was one of my biggest cinema regrets.  It was airing at the giant IMAX in NYC, so I jumped at the chance to grab tickets one Saturday afternoon.  I asked my fianc\u00e9 (31F) and a couple friends we were having brunch with that day if they wanted to come.  None of them were interested in Avatar, but my fianc\u00e9 and her friend (31F) wanted to see another movie that had recently come out.  So they agreed to come with to the theater, watch the other movie around the same time, then all meet up again afterward. \n\nThe friend is *ultra* skittish.  She's constantly looking over her shoulder, particularly looking out for men who might try to do something to her.  This friend generally avoids movie theaters because of the couple shootings that occurred around a decade ago.  The two of them had gone to a movie together before, however, and everything was fine.  I guess her internal warning radar went off a few times, but my fianc\u00e9 was able to calm her down and convince her nothing was out of the norm.\n\nOn this day, however, the friend and my fianc\u00e9 got spooked by a man who entered the theater in a hoodie with a backpack, while wearing noise cancelling headphones. I guess he sat right in the front row for a bit, with his headphones still on.  After a bit, he got up to go stand in the back and was rummaging through his backpack.  They both got super uncomfortable and noped out of there. \n\nNow, I am 100% on board with their decision in that case.  While most of that stuff is stuff I've seen hundreds of time with NYC weirdos, I'm proud of them for following their instincts and  removing themselves from the potential danger.  I love them and don't want anything to happen to them!\n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: after they left, my fianc\u00e9 began messaging me in an utter panic, explaining what happened and pleading with me to leave *my* theater.  If you're familiar with this theater at Lincoln Square, the huge IMAX is in its own separate wing of the building.  It's like a Disney attraction to get into.  It's own line and security, up several different sets of vertical escalators.  \n\nI explained that I'm glad they both got out of there and respect their intuitions on their situation, but that *I* felt totally safe in *my* theater, was enjoying my movie, and did not want to miss it.  She proceeded to send panic texts to me for the next couple hours and mentioned that she was going to try to have a manager come find me in the theater to ask me to come out.  I vehemently did not want to leave and just wanted to enjoy the movie.  I was starting to get resentful that she was ruining my enjoyment of my movie, but I simultaneously understood that she was legitimately panicked and fearful for me (even if I disagreed with her assessment of *my* danger.)\n\nAITA for NOT leaving *my* theater on the fearful intuitions of my fianc\u00e9 and her friend based on someone they saw in *their* theater?", "I'm a random, middle-aged guy, and I'll confess if you did that to me, I'd feel hurt and embarrassed, but by the same token, I'd have to tell myself to suck it up, and not take it personally.", "That movie made me feel good about my own survival instincts because I spent the whole time being like \"I wouldn't be doing any of this shit.\"\n\nLike, I probably >!wouldn't have gone into the Air B&B in the first place.!< But the real turning point for me was when the main character >!went BACK down into the basement after the guy.!< Like, hell no.
