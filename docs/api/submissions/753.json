It\u2019s literally empty except for me and 4 other passengers. So last minute this guy comes on, looks around for a while, and then asks to sit beside me. Quickly thinking to myself that I don\u2019t wanna be stuck beside a stranger for 4 hours when I don\u2019t have to be, I get up from my seat and tell him to go ahead, in the nicest way possible.. I then move a couple of seats behind the row I was sitting at. He gives me a really dirty look then and when I was getting off the bus, he rolled his eyes at me. Oh, also it\u2019s a direct bus by the way, there was no stops along the way. \n\nI understand that my actions probably seemed very rude, but I just honestly didn\u2019t feel like sitting beside a stranger for that length of time, when the bus was basically empty. Like it\u2019s nice to stretch yourself out on a journey that long and not have to mind someone else\u2019s personal space, and I also didn\u2019t feel like talking. But I feel guilty thinking I offended him or upset him, like the more I think of it the more guilty I feel. He obviously wanted someone to talk to but if it was a short journey I would\u2019ve , but I didn\u2019t wanna be stuck with him to find out he\u2019s a weirdo and then make it more awkward by *then* moving after talking to him. But then I still have the nagging feeling I was rude or could\u2019ve hurt him, and his facial expression\u2019s definitely implied it anyway. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: thanks for all the replies, I really appreciate it them and feeling a lot less guilty! \u2665\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1667338858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjm8ss/aita_for_moving_seats_when_a_man_asked_to_sit/", "score": 1551, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You do not owe this man or anyone else a conversation or someone to talk to. There were empty seats and he was being obnoxious by trying to sit with you. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA - if there were plenty of seats to choose from then he chose to sit next to you on purpose. It's weird to choose to sit next to someone on a bus when it's empty, most people choose empty rows until forced otherwise. It's a bit creepy tbh, I would have done the same thing", "NTA. You aren't required to be nice to anyone. Especially someone who decided to sit next to you, with a nearly empty bus, for 4 hours.

I\u2019m immunocompromised and once at urgent care, this unmasked couple with a dog sat right next to me, so of course I moved a few seats over. They proceeded to stare daggers at me.

Again, would that have made me a bad person?\n\nThis man doesn\u2019t know your story, he doesn\u2019t know your health status, he doesn\u2019t know anything about you. Why should he be mad at someone for not wanting to sit by a complete stranger?", "NTA. Remember, you don't have to feel to guilty when you push back against men who feel entitled to your time, space and energy.

You should have zero guilt. His issues are not your issues.", "NTA nothing good was going to come from that. \nYou held your boundary politely.

Why on earth would he choose to sit directly beside you when there were tons of empty seats?

He probably wanted to trap you for 4 hours. You were smart to move", "NTA. it's fine for him to want company. It's fine for you to not want company.

Gross.", "NTA. The fact that he was visibly upset with you for moving is all the proof you need that he was at best entitled to your space and time, at worst planning to harass you.

There was absolutely nothing wrong with you moving to a seat where you would be more comfortable.", "NTA. Don't worry about offending someone that tries that stunt. He sure doesn't care if he offends you. Better that you moved when you did, then attempt to get up five minutes later.", "Slight AH, you were unnecessarily rude, you could just say you'd rather be alone.", "NTA he had no reason to choose the seat he did unless it was to chat you up or feel you up.

You will never see him again so no worries", "I had this happen to me on a city bus once. A super overweight guy just had to sit next to me instead of one of the empty rows. I had a lot of bags and couldn\u2019t move away quickly, so I let him sit because I didn\u2019t want to cause a whole thing. Well he proceeded to pressing his hand against my leg in the weirdest way for the next few stops until he finally got off. I\u2019m not even sure it was sexual but I felt absolutely uncomfortable and trapped, won\u2019t forget about it for years. And that was a few minutes, not a 4 hour bus ride. You absolutely did the right thing. Never doubt yourself for making sure you can feel safe. Feelings of creeps come second by far. NTA", "NTA.  He was being creepy.  You don't have to worry about hurting random men's feelings when they're giving you unwanted attention.  Be civil and polite (unless that doesn't work) but don't spend one second worrying about whether you hurt the feelings of some creepy guy on the bus.", "NTA. Don't let a stranger \"trap\" you (I assume he wanted to sit in the aisle seat so it would be difficult for you to leave after he sat down.", "NTA.  Dude was a creeper and was just pissed that his \"plan\" didn't work.  You should definitely have moved away.

Trust your instincts every time.", "If I were in your position the only thing I would have done differently, is giving him the finger when he was giving out his dirty looks. \n\nI am sad/mad that society is guilting women to feel apologetic for making sure that they are safe.

NTA", "NTA. Feel free to take all of that guilt and just let it go. Women are conditioned to ignore their instincts in favour of being 'polite' and keeping the peace but you were smart not to do so. I think you handled the situation very gracefully. At best, he may have simply wanted to chat your ear off for 4 hours but he could have also become creepy, handsy and/or invasive. His reaction makes me suspect the latter. Never regret protecting yourself!", "He had no reason to sit next to you, plenty of seat available.\n\nIf you felt uncomfortable sitting next to him, then you had every right say no or move to another seat.\n\nThis sounds off to me him and I believe if you have a concern or feel unsafe, the people to change/move from others. \n\nIf May be nothing would have happened but the risk is always there and one time you don\u2019t listen to yourself could that tune something happens", "NTA, I feel like the equivalent of this is when there are like 5 urinals and you're using the one in the end and someone comes in and stands next to you lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They keep you safe.", "You feeling bad and allowing bad behavior is what some people like the jerk who pouted because you moved bank on. You never need to sacrifice your comfort and for a man, regardless of what society tries to ingrain into you. No one is entitled to your time and energy, and you were respectful by simply moving. Please don\u2019t feel bad and remember NTA.", "you do not owe random strange men your time because they're lonely or want to talk.", "You are being way way too generous to him. It is much more likely he is a creepy weirdo. If he is lonely he can find another guy to talk to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut shockingly he didn't do that.", "I used to felt bad about moving seats when, for example, stinky smokers sat by my side, until a therapist told me \"so you are displeasing yourself to please someone else\". I never felt guilty again in these situations", "But that isn\u2019t on you. You\u2019re not responsible for other peoples feelings - they are responsible for them. You are not responsible for someone\u2019s entertainment. He is a full on adult and is responsible for that. You don\u2019t owe people a conversation.  He is being entitled and then angry when you drew an utterly appropriate boundary. \n\nEntitled people always get angry when you draw boundaries. Just because someone is angry doesn\u2019t mean you did anything wrong!", "He could have been normal and sat 2 rows ahead of u and turned and tried to spark up a convo. The sit next to move is creepy as hell", "A person who is already lonely isn't going to have the energy to roll their eyes at you.", "That's because sitting next to a stranger on an empty bus IS inherently weird. \n\nHe started out acting weird. Of course your natural reaction is to think \"this guy might be a weirdo\".", "Plus, if he truly was just lonely and wanted a conversational partner, he wouldn't roll his eyes and give you dirty looks when turned down!! Those are major red flags.", "There are apps for that. If he wanted to chat, he could go where other people want that, too. Instead, he tried to force a situation with a woman alone on a bus. Super creepy. You did the right thing, no worries.\n\nWhen something like this happens to me, I tell them the seat is taken. Can't they tell? Then start talking to the empty air about the aliens.", "Or try to save your eternal soul and convince you to accept Jesus Christ. Which imo is worse than a secular pyramid scheme", "Why is it your responsibility to fulfill the needs of lonely stranger on the bus?", "Who cares if he\u2019s lonely? That\u2019s completely not your problem.", "There\u2019s a book called The Gift of Fear. Great read. But the gist is fuck politeness, trust your gut. There are shitty people out there. Being overly polite gets people killed.", "A guy with no motives wouldn't have tried to make you feel bad. A decent guy would've felt bad himself for making you uncomfortable.\n\n\nAn almost empty bus should follow the same rules as the row of urinals in the men's room. Under no circumstances do you pony up to the one next to one in use.", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to comfort and feeling safe like anyone else. There was no reason for him sit with you when he had lots of other seats from which to choose. Don't feel guilty for taking care of your needs.", "Honey, he had bad intentions and your gut was right! That is a skill that you should continue to master.\n\n*Never* let someone make you feel guilty for keeping yourself safe.\n\nYou should be SO proud of yourself!", "Read the Gift of Fear. Always always listen to your gut. Never be afraid to tell someone to get away from you.", "As two women much wiser than I have said \u201cfu@k politeness\u201d. If someone is making you uncomfortable for ANY reason you do not owe them politeness.", "They never said only women find this creepy; they are pointing out that women are conditioned to be polite to rude creeps.", "well obviously but no one is talking abt that right now", "No one said it was just women....?", "lol \n\nI once had a nanny summer job for two young kids. That was my go-to line all summer: \"I am not your jungle gym!\" Then they'd pounce again.", "Which is the definition of a creep, nah?", "Why do I think of this as worse", "And this guy is not entitled to creep on a stranger and force themselves in their bubble for hours...", "Hahaha i shouldn\u2019t laugh but as soon as I read this, was like yeah this is a young woman. Don\u2019t feel bad OP. He was just a creep", "He didn't just sit next to OP. He asked for consent if he could join OP. There is a big difference.", "He asked for consent to sit next to her. He didn't just sit there. \n\nWhile I agree 100% that OP had no obligation to interact with another human being and had a right to her solitude, I think what made the interaction awkward is that OP didnt just decline for him to sit next to her.  She literally got all of her belongings and changed seats. If we're being honest, I think many people would be taken aback by that response. \n\nI've ridden on trains/buses with unassigned seating, and some people just want to harmlessly talk and meet other humans. The reality is, I don't think the vast majority of commenters would be calling this person a creep, a degenerate, or implying they are a serial k*ller if they were a woman.", "Nope\ud83d\ude05", "Exactly. Even if this guy had been acting in good faith (he wasn't, but hypothetically...), if Op hurt his feelings prioritizing her own well-being that is OK. Even if he was the kindest person in the country (again he's not but hypothetically), she doesn't owe him her time or attention. \n\nSaying \"no\" is not rude. Wanting to be left alone is not mean. \n\nAnd being rude and mean isn't always a bad thing anyway. It all depends on the situation.", "I like that you've clarified guys only do it to *live* women", "That book made me realise I was pushing aside my own feelings of discomfort in order to not offend people. These days I often choose to not get into elevators, go into spaces or engage in conversation with people, particularly men, if my gut instinct says something is off.", "That's a really good book. My karate Sensei is an ex  cop,  and he has taught everything that is in it.", "Great book, everyone should read it.  Also, if you can stomach horror movies (and this one is terrifying), watch \"Speak No Evil\", which deals almost entirely with the subject of \"being too nice\" when you should have been on your heels heeding the warning signs all around.  It contains one of the most haunting lines ever:  \"Why are you doing this to us?\"  \"Because you let me.\"", "I am going to look for this now, thank you!", "This sounds like something I should read, thanks for posting this.", "I\u2019m so glad you mentioned this book! I read the post and immediately thought to suggest it, as well.", "Yup.\"Stay rude, stay alive\"", "I can\u2019t imagine a scenario where this is a decent guy.", "Not all men are bad. You don't know what his intention was. But his intentions don't matter, OP wasn't up for sitting next to him and/or talking to him and that's reason enough. My bet is that he got on the bus, saw someone he wanted to flirt with, got rejected and was pissed because his ego got bruised.", "My dad gave me this book when I was 16, it changed my whole worldview. Great recommendation!", "Why are they a sexual predator now?\n\nWas it weird, yeah, would I sit next to a person with a bunch of empty seats? Nope, but I don't get why this person is a predator now.", "\u2665\ufe0f", "Four hours of attention is a best case scenario.", "By this I mean the old:\n\n\u201cBut I was just being friendly!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me sitting here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?

I can\u2019t control if someone sits in X or Y seat. Sure, guy can sit there if he wants, OP can\u2019t stop him. She can however move herself, so she did. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t physically stop my toddler from yelling, I don\u2019t control her vocal cords, but I can make my point that I won\u2019t tolerate it by going to another room.", "Honestly, saying no can result in a negative unpleasant response.  It is often better to concede to give them the seat they want and simply move to a new space.  Saying no can lead to the argument that they are entitled to sit in that seat - great, then take it and I will move. She can't predict who he is - I will always say go with your gut. And I have done the same with a woman in my space.  I live in a rather large city so this is my experience based on various forms of public transit. Perhaps elsewhere one might feel different.", "I think it's even creepier that he looked around and PICKED you to sit next to. He didnt just sit next to someone he singled you out intentionally. And then rolled his eyes? Yuck!", "Oops meant \u2018lone\u2019", "Yep! After seeing an interview with the author, I  jumped right off an elevator bc I got a creepy vibe. When I turned around, I saw the guy had moved right behind where I was standing, and he  looked furious, and was wearing a heavy wool coat, and carrying a second one over his arm. It was a hot spring day. After that experience, I trust my instinct and don't give a second thought if I make someone uncomfortable. I am self employed and I have \"fired\" prospective clients before they even come in if they feel off. Recently, my landlord said \" You can't just fire people for being annoying\" and I was like \" I sure can\"", "Likewise, the first half-hour of *Barbarian* was inspired by that book.", "You can flirt from the seat in front or behind or across the aisle. Only a creep chooses the seat that would make her *stuck* in his company.", "Noooope.", "If he wanted to chat I could see talking the seat across the aisle.maybe.  \n\nBut he did not do that. Let\u2019s real talk, this guy was hoping she would fall asleep so he could get his grope on.", "I didn't say they were.  Did you misread my comment?", "I didn\u2019t want to scare her, but yeah. Predators count on their victims being too polite or embarrassed to make a scene.", "I know, right? \u201cHmmm, who on this bus can I get away with leching on\u2026\u201d", "A writer friend had a super creepy guy donating uber extra to her Kickstarter (like, wait outside the normal extra donation) and then was trying to leverage that as inside access pass to her life. She was able to do some stern boundaries and he left her alone.\n\nRandomly on Twitter a couple of months ago, we got talking. His name came up. she googled. He was on trial for a gruesome murder. (Just got sentenced to life in prison). \n\nTrust. Your. Gut.", "Just watched that movie a few days ago. I was wondering why the 1st part was so fantastic. It lost me after that though lol!", "Yup, another really good one along the same lines.  Lots of horror movies are like this.  People may think they're gross and hard to watch, but many of them probably have better survival lessons than any other kind of movie!  ;-)", "LOL, this is straight projection.\n\nAgain, I don't agree with it and wouldn't want to sit next to someone in a mostly empty bus. \n\nBut the guy now is a creepy sexual predator is on you ladies. That's why I wont talk to you at the gym, I don't need to be called a sexual predator... how many sets you got left? That's it, cool I'll do other shit tell the machine is free.", "Reddit and reading comprehension is like oil and water.", "Then yeah, for me a sexual predator would just be quietly sitting next to me. Just like a serial killer.\n\nSerial killer chatty cathy would probably be the worst then.", "Holy crap!", "I just watched that last night, and man it just got weird and weirder as it went on.", "I get it, you're wholly incapable of putting yourself in someone else's place, and the worst thing you worry about when you leave the house each day is, \"Someone might talk to me!\".", "Dude had a murder journal.
