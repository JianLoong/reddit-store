Well my mum did. \n\nI obviously can't bend down and shouldn't be picking my toddler up. My mum has been annoying me SO much lately. \n\nWhen my daughter poops my mum says she will go and grab her changing stuff and lift her onto her mat and we can both sort her out. I say ok, and wait with the wipes out, a nappy bag and a new nappy ready. \n\nAfter a few minutes I go and see whats taking so long only to find my mum completely doing something else. She was even unloading the dishwasher once. I reminded her that my daughter needed changing and she said she 'was going to sort it right out'. I went back upstairs and after 15 more minutes and my daughter still not changed. I went and lifted her up and did it myself. \n\nMy mum got annoyed and said she was just about to do it, even though she was now re-loading the dishwasher. My daughter had been left in a poppy nappy for around 20 minutes and apart from it stinking, it wasn't fair at all and hygienic for her. Poor little soul! \n\nThis isn't the first time this has happened. She says she will do something and then goes off and does something completely pointless and I end up doing the thing.\n\nSurprise surprise I have popped a few stitches and had to go back.

My mum had come and picked me up from there when I had it done and said she would help to the nurses, etc. \n\nI was honest again and said she isn't helping but I still have to take care of my daughter and feed, change her when she goes off. The nurse wasn't pleased at all and had a conversation with my mum after I left. \n\nNow my mum is in a mood with me and said I'm making her look bad, I'm over reacting and such. \n\nI asked her if she would have liked to have been left in her own sh*t for 20 minutes with it all going up her back and not being able to do anything and she said no. I then asked then why does she expect my daughter to be left like that?!\n\nShe still says I'm being dramatic and she was just about to do it etc.\n\n\nEdit: I got my surgery now because it was really hurting my back and making my shoulders bent in! My doctor suggested having it now and I said I'll wait but my mum pushed me to get it done ASAP and said she would help out with everything and for me to just rest.

But I can imagine that won't be easy.\n\nIf it's not usual for her I'm wondering if it is illness or mental deterioration or just procrastination because she doesn't enjoy the processes involved in looking after a young child but doesn't want to admit it since she knows she offered to help.\n\nWhatever the cause she's put OP in a very difficult position but if she's unwell and doesn't realise how poorly she's functioning then she's not really an asshole.", "How is it you cant lean forward to change a nappy?", "I agree. Something more could be at play and what a sad way to find out about it. Mom\u2019s inability to focus/forgetfulness are signs not to be ignored. I feel sorry for OP if this does become the case; she\u2019ll have her baby and possibly mom to take care of. Early onset dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s can easily be mistaken for ADHD.", "Only problem is, she was reminded, and then she continued to do the task and then start a new task. I have ADHD. I understand the trouble, but when reminded of what i have to do, I do what i was supposed to do originally. I've straight up forgotten things and had to go back like four times to get everything for my injured husband", "Yes, was thinking the same thing.", "It also sounds like she's a people-pleaser or that she's got the habit of overpromising when she can't deliver on it.

NTA!", "Doctor said do it now, her mom said she'd help and to do it now, so OP finally gave in. i have bug breasts and it is physically painful so i can understand why OP needed it now rather than later", "The question you should be asking is: \n\n\nWhy did her mother agree with doctor that surgery needed done now and agree to help take care of her grandchild and not do so?", "OP's mom offered to help. While ideally OP wouldn't have to live with her parents, they did offer their home and assistance. Accepting your family's help isn't entitled. If the mother wasn't going to actually follow through, she shouldn't have offered.\n\nOP didn't \"elect\" to have surgery; she had a necessary procedure at the time her doctor suggested it and her mother encouraged.\n\nOP isn't rushing her mother \"to do things on [OP's] time.\" A child covered in poo *should* take precedence over the dishwasher or other chores. Apart from the child's comfort, there are health issues that sitting in poo can cause.\n\nShould OP lie to her medical provider? \"Oh, yeah, my mom is taking total care of the baby, so I've been using the time to get in shape: push-ups, chest presses, burpees, jumping jacks. Should I not be doing that?\"\n\nThe mother's lackadaisical help literally injured OP (busting a stitch is *painful*), and it seems as if the mother needed a bit of a dressing down from professionals regarding the obligations *she volunteered to take on.* The mother couldn't have been \"thrown under the bus\" if she was doing the right thing.", "I\u2019m not trying to be mean but this sounds a senile person. Seriously, anybody who has to be reminded of the shape you\u2019re in after surgery is not fully present. Anybody who has to have it explained to them that a diaper change happens immediately when needed has a diminished capacity. Again, not trying to be rude. I know this is a high stress time for you as a single mother of a baby in diapers while recovering from major surgery. This is probably not a good time for more bad news but jiminy, girl, your mom is not firing on all cylinders. She may still be in focus enough for most ordinary purposes. But you are coming up against the new edges of her capabilities. I\u2019m so sorry. Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "You need to get her checked out tbh. Otherwise it will be so difficult for you to recover", "Listen, I'm sitting here two weeks after a surgery that my parents also said they would help with. My mom took me, made a shitty comment about by house before the anesthesia even wore off, showed up the next day to feed my dogs for me, then I was on my own. She left town two days later and left me to my dad, knowing he has his own health issues preventing him from being meaningful help. I've done everything myself since, and it's extended my recovery time because of it. Then she has the audacity to message me asking if i wanted to run errands with her, hasnt checked in since the day after my surgery. Having someone say they will help when you need it and then not is fucking maddening. She agreed and so prevented you from looking for someone that would ACTUALLY help you. I could have had a friend come help me or made different arrangements, but my mother promised help. Then I found out I didn't have it when I could do nothing about it. Your mom is an ass.

OP said it was silly for someone to suggest that so i just wanted to know why it was a silly suggestion!\n\nBut yes i get your point that it isn't about what she can or can not do just the fact she was offered the help and is not getting it.", "Yeah, I\u2019ve seen it happen firsthand with my MIL. She was always dependable to get things done. Then slowly over time, she\u2019d forget why she was doing something or how to do it altogether. We shrugged it off as her just getting older and her memory going fuzzy. It just got progressively worse over about a 5 year span, to the point that it finally felt like she needed medical attention for it.\n\nThe hardest part was we were all in a bit of denial and making excuses: she\u2019s just tired, she\u2019s trying to do too much, it\u2019s just part of getting older, etc. We would get annoyed with her in the moment and then just go on about our business; very easy to do when you\u2019ve never had experience with someone who suffered from dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s. It was heartbreaking when a specialist was able to finally diagnose her. We all felt so much guilt for not seeing it and doing something sooner but it\u2019s not so obvious and no one wanted to jump to that conclusion.\n\nSo, now, we just try to be as patient as possible when she\u2019s not in the same \u201cmoment\u201d as we are. We have to do a lot of reassuring that she\u2019s in her home or that so-and-so is actually someone she knows or that she\u2019s not being spied upon and no one is trying to poison her. There\u2019s plenty more instances but those are the usual ones. It can be exhausting since the pattern of when this happens is so unpredictable and the repetitive assurances sometimes calm her quickly but most of the time don\u2019t. Mainly we just have to understand that she processes information differently than before and can\u2019t be forced to respond they way we want her to. The efforts are worth it though and we take advantage of all the moments when she is in the \u201chere and now\u201d with us.", "It could.

To be fair, this was just included in an edit.", "I wasn't 100% certain if what I said was correct or slightly missing the mark myself so I added the ? just incase someone needed to correct me! Stitches and surgical wounds are weird things at times. \n\nAlso NTA op.", "in another comment she mentions spinal issues"]}
