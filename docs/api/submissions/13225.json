Well my mum did. \n\nI obviously can't bend down and shouldn't be picking my toddler up. My mum has been annoying me SO much lately. \n\nWhen my daughter poops my mum says she will go and grab her changing stuff and lift her onto her mat and we can both sort her out. I say ok, and wait with the wipes out, a nappy bag and a new nappy ready. \n\nAfter a few minutes I go and see whats taking so long only to find my mum completely doing something else. She was even unloading the dishwasher once. I reminded her that my daughter needed changing and she said she 'was going to sort it right out'. I went back upstairs and after 15 more minutes and my daughter still not changed. I went and lifted her up and did it myself. \n\nMy mum got annoyed and said she was just about to do it, even though she was now re-loading the dishwasher. My daughter had been left in a poppy nappy for around 20 minutes and apart from it stinking, it wasn't fair at all and hygienic for her. Poor little soul! \n\nThis isn't the first time this has happened. She says she will do something and then goes off and does something completely pointless and I end up doing the thing.\n\nSurprise surprise I have popped a few stitches and had to go back.

My mum had come and picked me up from there when I had it done and said she would help to the nurses, etc. \n\nI was honest again and said she isn't helping but I still have to take care of my daughter and feed, change her when she goes off. The nurse wasn't pleased at all and had a conversation with my mum after I left. \n\nNow my mum is in a mood with me and said I'm making her look bad, I'm over reacting and such. \n\nI asked her if she would have liked to have been left in her own sh*t for 20 minutes with it all going up her back and not being able to do anything and she said no. I then asked then why does she expect my daughter to be left like that?!\n\nShe still says I'm being dramatic and she was just about to do it etc.\n\n\nEdit: I got my surgery now because it was really hurting my back and making my shoulders bent in! My doctor suggested having it now and I said I'll wait but my mum pushed me to get it done ASAP and said she would help out with everything and for me to just rest.

I just went from a L cup to a C cup in December, so I understand all your pain. Getting it done earlier is smart, I didn't manage until I was 42. I am sorry your mom is being a shit helper. Recovery is so difficult. I just had a hysterectomy 2 weeks ago and it's been MASSIVELY easier to recover from. \n\nWhat was the reason your procedure involved cutting off and grafting the nipples? My doc kept mine attached and moved them, which is a safer procedure with retaining blood supply, but I know there's so many reasons that may not work. Again, all the hugs and pain killers to you. I hope you will be enjoying your new boobs. I am happier than I could have thought, even with continuing pain and itch (I have scarring issues and had cellulitis in the bottom scars that needed some heavy antibiotics for a couple weeks...) I thought I was gonna have disphoria about the new boobs, but I really don't. I feel RIGHT. Looking at my old pictures makes me cringe. Looking at other women with heavy boobs makes all those old feelings come back. \n\nI hope you also enjoy going out and buying bras. I bought a few sports bras for super cheap at Aldi afterward and the incredible feeling of that purchase, lol. No more 80 buck bras that still hurt and dig cause my boobs were so heavy. I intend to never wear an underwire again (mostly because the idea of an underwire against my scars sounds awful, but also, I don't neeeeeeeed them!) The fun part of the breast reduction is the breast lift. Though they will sag a little back down as all that swelling goes down. Keep compression on all the time, and your swelling should go down by the month mark, and they will start feeling really natural and squishy. I will admit I keep handling my boobs now. \n\nAlso, how are your nipples doing? I have one that inverted after the surgery, though I wasn't surprised. The right nipple was ALWAYS kinda... flatter? not as responsive? We are keeping an eye on it, but that can be a complication. My left nipple tends to stay out and erect, but it's done that since I had a papilloma behind it and had a lumpectomy two years ago. Good news is it wasn't cancer (my first mammogram) and better news is that both you and I have lessened chances of getting breast cancer after the reduction, due to the amount of tissue removed. I went looking after my surgery and found a load of medical studies about it, because I'm a weirdo who has to obsessively research everything...\n\nIF your scars start getting bad, don't be afraid to talk to your doctor about it. I start laser therapy in April to help my keloids. I also have a dermatologist who does steroid injections. Most people really don't have issues, but sometimes your body gets weird. \n\nALSO PRO TIP: once you have the steri strips and bandages off, and your incisions are healed, they will probably tell you to start rubbing lotion into them to help keep the scars down. You massage it in to break up the scar tissue. If you get all itchy or painful in them like me, go get yourself a roll-on lidocaine tube. Roll that all on your scars, and it helps so very much. My nightly routine is shower, then a steroid cream on my scars, the cocoa butter lotion all on my scars and boobs, and then the lidocaine on my underboob scars since that's my remaining pain and itch spots. \n\nAlso wear the sports bra or compression bra at least 3 months all the time. I've only just started sleeping without a bra again, though some nights I still do if I'm feeling sensitive. It helps everything heal in place since they basically frankenboob all the tissues. I did find it much easier to sleep in a bra after my surgery, I think because I had sports bras with no underwires, and that was so different than the 36 LL monstrosities I had. It was still uncomfortable under my boobs where the scars that are keloiding are, and where I had the cellulitis, but that's gotten better as well, esp. with the lidocaine help. I had holes under my boobs that weeped for a month, but I'm hoping you heal faster and easier. I also had reactions to all the tape, the steri strips, and the stitches, which my body pushed out and why I had the holes and the cellulitis. But my doctor said that it was normal, and that the underboob incisions are the hardest part to heal for everyone. So I wish you well.\n\nSorry about the long comment. I'm a talker and I just wanted to impart some advice that I learned. Though if your doctor says different, follow their advice first. This is just my experience.", "YTA here. \n\nI don\u2019t think you have any idea how much work it is caring for two people like this.

Well, the baby wanted his milk *now*, not in a minute, so I had to stop, wash my hands, get the milk, give it to dad, finish up, pee, wash my hands again. This is stressful, and having to quickly \"re thread\" tasks into the next 5 minutes significantly increases the chances I'll fail and forget something important. The added stress subtracts from my ability to get other things done, too. \n\nIf it's ADHD, OP wouldn't remember the worst of it because Mom would have settled into a routine by then.

Think the mom is a \"main character\" type and the rest of us are npcs with no consequences to what is said to us or making us wait. My mom was not senile or in anyway starting down that path, it has been like that for literal years. I had a doctor threaten her with CPS for ignoring me getting sick (and was promptly hospitalized.) Some people are just like that unfortunately.", "I dunno, my mother was like this.  It's just being sort of self centered--especially the part about not liking being held accountable by the nurse.

In addition, it often worsens with age.\n\nNot everyone who has ADHD is the same. It can present in very diverse ways, and it can. manifest inconsistently.

And my dad was supposed to help me one day, but he disappeared to his work and didn\u2019t stay home to help. I was so wiped out without help getting food and water from downstairs I almost passed out that evening and ended up collapsing on the floor. (He didn\u2019t have to go to his job that day - he just really likes it.) My mom and I let him have it about his lack of care. And he did better. \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t have any kids to take care of either, just me. But just taking care of myself left me exhausted. \n\nThey just folded up the connections for my nipples inside though? Not completely removed and grafted?", "I agree - not an expert but to *me*, this sounds like the beginning stages of some kind of dementia (assuming it's newer behaviour, and she hasn't always been like this). It sounds like she *forgot* that the baby needed changing, and lacked the capacity to \"walk back\" to where she was, so she invented a new task for herself. \n\nThe reason that's a *huge* warning sign of dementia is because usually, when you forget what you were doing, you have the capacity to \"find your place\". You can present yourself with stimuli that will remind you what you were doing. That's why, when you forget something, you'll often suddenly remember it a while later. One of the first things a person with dementia often loses is the ability to do that. So when they forget what they were doing, they make up a new task from scratch. \n\n\"Oh, I don't remember why I'm in here. I see that the dishwasher is full, I must've been doing that!\" Meanwhile she's completely missing the poop smell and baby crying, that would normally cue her to go \"No, wait - I was changing a diaper!\" So OP reminds her \"No, we were changing a diaper\". Now she's embarrassed, because she forgot. And she's not supposed to forget stuff like this. A couple minutes later, she's forgotten again. \"What was I doing? God, this is frustrating!\" *Still* not recognising the cues that should *tell* her what she was doing.  \n Just as an example. That may not be how it actually played out - that's just how it will often play out with a dementia patient.\n\nAs you already pointed out, they also tend to be *super* defensive about it - because they *know* something's wrong with them. They know it's not normal. And that scares the shit out of them. They'll often try to convince themselves that if they pretend to be healthy long enough, they will magically become healthy again.", "This.\n\nPeople who are experiencing these sorts of problems also sometimes lose the ability to understand time sensitivity when it comes to certain things. Chances are that OP\u2019s mum was doing as she was asked, saw the dishes and her brain went \u201cI should do that first.\u201d Rather than \u201cI can do that later\u201d because it doesn\u2019t understand that a baby cannot sit in a poo filled diaper for however long it takes for her to empty the dishes the way it once used to. It\u2019s also possible she had a moment where her mind went blank so she couldn\u2019t remember what she was doing and then saw something that needed to be done and did it thinking that was what she was going to do in the first place.", "It\u2019s true.

Check whether there are more tasks mum forgets to do moments after she decides to do them...", "This is not a sufficient indicator of senility. This could simply be a self-centered, scatterbrained person who doesn't like to admit she's wrong.\n\nI could see the scene: she agrees to help change darling little Amber, then she goes downstairs to grab something she needs and sees the full dishwasher. Suddenly Amber flies out of her brain and the dishwasher needs to be unloaded NOW. I have definitely been in that situation before where 20 minutes later I am on a completely different task and have forgotten all about the original task.\n\nThe problem, here is mom's complete nonchalance about the entire thing. That's sometimes a defense mechanism for folks with cognitive issues (which include but aren't limited to senility) - if this doesn't matter then it's not such a big deal that I totally forgot about it, so let's minimize how much it matters so I feel better.\n\nCognitive decline does begin a bit younger than a lot of people are prepared for, so it could be possible that mom is finding it difficult to do the toddler things or that she's frequently forgetting what she's in the middle of and so ends up doing something else.
