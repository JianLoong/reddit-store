I went from a J down to a C cup, I had to have my nipples cut off - iced and then grafted back on so you can imagine how painful it is for me currently.\n\nI have a 17 month old (her dad isn't in the picture) and i moved in with my parents because they said they would help me. Well my mum did. \n\nI obviously can't bend down and shouldn't be picking my toddler up. My mum has been annoying me SO much lately. \n\nWhen my daughter poops my mum says she will go and grab her changing stuff and lift her onto her mat and we can both sort her out. I say ok, and wait with the wipes out, a nappy bag and a new nappy ready. \n\nAfter a few minutes I go and see whats taking so long only to find my mum completely doing something else. She was even unloading the dishwasher once. I reminded her that my daughter needed changing and she said she 'was going to sort it right out'. I went back upstairs and after 15 more minutes and my daughter still not changed. I went and lifted her up and did it myself. \n\nMy mum got annoyed and said she was just about to do it, even though she was now re-loading the dishwasher. My daughter had been left in a poppy nappy for around 20 minutes and apart from it stinking, it wasn't fair at all and hygienic for her. Poor little soul! \n\nThis isn't the first time this has happened. She says she will do something and then goes off and does something completely pointless and I end up doing the thing.\n\nSurprise surprise I have popped a few stitches and had to go back. The nurse asked what I've been doing and I was honest and told her, she said I'm not meant to be picking up my 17 month old and my mum was supposed to be helping. My mum had come and picked me up from there when I had it done and said she would help to the nurses, etc. \n\nI was honest again and said she isn't helping but I still have to take care of my daughter and feed, change her when she goes off. The nurse wasn't pleased at all and had a conversation with my mum after I left. \n\nNow my mum is in a mood with me and said I'm making her look bad, I'm over reacting and such. \n\nI asked her if she would have liked to have been left in her own sh*t for 20 minutes with it all going up her back and not being able to do anything and she said no. I then asked then why does she expect my daughter to be left like that?!\n\nShe still says I'm being dramatic and she was just about to do it etc.\n\n\nEdit: I got my surgery now because it was really hurting my back and making my shoulders bent in! My doctor suggested having it now and I said I'll wait but my mum pushed me to get it done ASAP and said she would help out with everything and for me to just rest. Said its 6 weeks out of my life and she 'has everything under control'.", "created_utc": 1679839526, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122n2e2/aita_for_ratting_out_my_mum_to_a_nurse_and_not/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Large breasts can cause a lot of back and leg pains so I'm assuming this may have been the cause for you.\n\nYour parents said they would help out, so, of course, you expected it so no point in waiting another year with (my assumption) pain.\n\nDoes your mom have memory issues? Or get distracted easily?\n\nI can't think of a way to get your mom to take things more seriously and understand how you feel except for childish/pity ideas.", "NTA, but did you have to have this done now? Couldn't you have waited a bit longer, until your daughter is a bit older and doesn't need as much hands on help?\n\nI know your mom said she would help,a nd she should be, but personally, I'd probably try to need as little help as humanly possible, which, with a toddler you can't pick up, is going to be a stretch.", "NTA - Your mom sounds like she might have some sort of mental health issues that she's unable to focus on a single task. I'm sorry that your support person isn't helping you the way they promised. :-(", "YTA, your entitlement is next level. Your expectations of your mom are completely inappropriate if you couldn\u2019t take care of your daughter, where is the child\u2019s father? It\u2019s not your mom\u2019s job to take care of your daughter. How many bad choices in your life are going to make your mom\u2019s fault? She already gotta provide for you and your child housing now she gotta raise her granddaughter. All because you chose a deadbeat baby daddy, elected to have surgery, and have the nerve to be rushing your mom to do things on your time for your daughter. Then when she doesn\u2019t you throw her under the bus. The woman who is providing for you and your child a home. Grow up and get out your mother\u2019s house. Perhaps then you will appreciate your mom more, when see hard hard it really is out there for single mom\u2019s such as yourself.", "Hi all! I've added an edit.\n\nI got told by my doctor to have the surgery now as it was really hurting my back and turning my shoulders inwards, like I was hunched over. My mum pushed me to have it ASAP and said she would have everything under control and for me to rest. \n\nI would have liked to of waited. I've asked her if I'm a burden and can be helping more to which she's said no, she likes having us here. She just gets 'side tracked' whatever that means.\n\nI'm also not meant to be bending down so the whole changing her on the floor thing that someone said is ridiculous.", "YTA. You are a single mom there is no way around it. Instead of being grateful that your mom is there and helping you are snippy and ungrateful. What would you have done if you weren't at your parents house? Done everything yourself anyway. And you know why? Because you are a mother. Instead of lifting her up, change her on a blanket on the ground. \nYou are not even trying to find solutions but just trying to blame everyone else.\nAnd when you don't like honest answers here, you get but hurt and even more snippy. Just grow up! \nI feel very sorry for your poor mother having to put up with you!", "NTA your mom is making excuses and you're not being dramatic. Also when it comes to the baby that takes priority not some other random shit. You did good and if the nurse is upset with her it's because she's fucking up", "ESH your mother may not have realized how much help you needed. Maybe you should be help more around the house so there isn\u2019t so many other things your mother is getting distracted with. You could have also delayed your elective surgery one year until your daughter was potty trained.", "INFO\n\nHad the dishwasher also defecated in its diaper? \n\nThere's an order of priorities here, and \"human sitting in shit\" takes priority over \"dishwasher contains dishes\".", "Since you say \"mum\" and sound budget-constrained but can still afford surgery, I'll assume you live in a civilized country with proper healthcare. \n\nYour mom's behavior isn't great, but I'm confused why your child has to be lifted to get a diaper change. Are you prevented from putting a blanket or mat on the floor and going down to your kid's level to take care of it yourself?\n\nI know that if someone was offering to help me out and let me stay with them, there's an unspoken rule that I shouldn't increase the burden on them if I can avoid it. \n\nI'm sure that the reduction is necessary though. But I can imagine mom getting a bit frustrated if it's looking like you will do nothing at all for your kid and abdicate responsibility to your mom instead. \n\nI guess this is an INFO. How would your mom describe you in this situation? Are you doing as much as you can, and she is covering what you can't? Or would she feel that you've begun to take advantage?", "NTA. Your mom was not about to do it. She would have left the baby stinking and in a terrible situation for longer.

It\u2019s important to remember that your mother is helping you out here. She could easily have left you to figure it out on your own. I agree with the other person who said she wasn\u2019t resting on her laurels. Certainly she needs to reprioritise what jobs take precedence but I don\u2019t think badmouthing her to your healthcare provider was appropriate either.", "NTA. \u2018Just about to do it\u2019 is just about the laziest lie in the book, and when your mom is calling you dramatic its probably because that\u2019s easier for her than admitting she wasnt properly caring for your child.\n\n But apart from that, this very much reads like someone who has an issue with hyperfocusing and not prioritizing tasks. If you want ways to fix that that dont lead to altercations or disagreements, maybe try re-prioritizing statements with your mom instead. So rather than saying \u201cmom, (daughter) needs to be changed, can you help\u201d try \u201cI need to get (daughter) here now, can you help me?\u201d And wait in her eyeline if possible.", "Has your mom always been absent minded or is this new? Sometimes new confusion can be a sign of illness and a lot of times the person experiencing the issue will try to explain it away with excuses similar to your mom's. You might consider talking it over with your dad to see if you can put more puzzle pieces together and to see if he can offer you additional help. There are online resources you can look into regarding dementia that may help you as well. You may also see about getting other assistance; I'm not sure what that would look like, maybe a carer in a few times a day or a neighbor, maybe modifying things so you don't have to lift your child, etc. But you definitely need to take care of yourself so you heal properly.", "i hope you\u2019re feeling better and feeling relieved so much weigh is literally gone. \n\nNTA!", "YTA\n\nYou are in a lot of pain and likely not thinking clearly, but please try to remember that your mother is under no obligation to be your maidservant and wait on you hand and foot and care for your child after your elective surgery procedure. It's lovely that she is helping you out, and when she doesn't do it perfectly I would remind myself that *she could always leave, and you would have no help at all*. Where is this child's father? So rather than being nasty when she's gotten distracted because you and your daughter have created so many messy chores for her to tend to, you could say, hey mom, can you help me with this diaper? It wasn't like she was reading a magazine or scrolling through Facebook. There were lots of chores that needed done taking care of YOU and YOUR DAUGHTER and she was slaving away doing dishes. A little appreciation would be appropriate, rather than acting like an entitled brat with the nurse.", "I can imagine a few things several years in the making had to come together for the timing of this, so it's plausible OP asked mom \"would you help me if I do it?\" and got a green light then.", "OP (NTA) had major surgery and her parents *offered* to help. How is that entitled? If my children needed help after major surgery, as a mother I would absolutely do so! It\u2019s not as if OP moved in for the next 18 years! She already mentioned the father isn\u2019t in the picture, so why ask?", "Awww is someone butt hurt?", "OP had surgery and wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing the feeding/changing die to the risk of rupturing stitches (which happened). The mom said she would help, which was presumably a deciding factor in OP getting the surgery when she did. OP put a great amount of trust in her mom, but the mon dropped the ball and treated the child like it was a tertiary responsibility.\n\nThe nurses\u2019 obligation is to their patient, so OP did the right thing by telling them about how the stitches got ruptured. If OP\u2019s mom is upset about \u201clooking bad\u201d, she shouldn\u2019t have dropped the ball.\n\nNTA. Your mom sounds like a nightmare.", "Reductions aren't always elective. One year later that toddler's probably going to be even more work.", "This made me chuckle. I know right!!", "Major surgery that is elective. She could have waited until the kid was older, though. \n\nMy vote was NTA, because the mom made a commitment to help, but I do think the OP was a bit irresponsible, having this surgery while her kid is so young.", "You could have waited to have surgery until your daughter was older. This person is right, you sound very entitled. That's not her being butthurt, it's you being immature and expecting too much from your mother.", "YTA.

It's a bold move, Cotton...", "They are elective in the VAST majority of cases, even if there is a potential medical reason to do it, like back pain. I don't know of any cases when it isn't elective, but Google is also not helping me, so I'm giving the benefit of the doubt. \n\nToddler might be more \"work\" but would need less picking up, which is what OP can't do, and what ruptered the stitches.", "It's not always elective and clearly don't understand the pain that comes with such a large chest size", "Elective, perhaps. She didn\u2019t state why she had it it in the first place. Her breasts could be causing back/spinal issues and a lot of pain. Waiting could exacerbate those problems, causing more surgeries. \n\nI say this as a person who recently found out I have to have total disc arthroplasty, cervical discectomy and/or fusion from my neck alllll the way down. My previous GP thought I was too young (40) for arthritis and ignored my complaints and family history of arthritis and stenosis.\n\nNow it\u2019s too late for injections or any other non-surgical procedures. Had there been earlier intervention, I may not have needed surgery at all. \n\nOP didn\u2019t relay why she had to have it now, but in many cases, early intervention is critical.", "How do you know that the surgery was elective?"]}
