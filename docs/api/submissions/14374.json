That is HUMOR. He is TA", "NTA\nSounds like he can dish it out, but can\u2019t take it. People come in all shapes and sizes.

She should have some empathy for you and how this makes you feel.", "NTA!!!", "NTA, but he sure is.", "NTA. It's easier to be a short woman, but I reply to such comments with my advantages of being short. It's good to be short because I fit under the desk during and earthquake and I will never get deep vein thrombosis from sitting on a plane too long because I can stand up under the overhead storage. Admittedly it's a short list, but it makes me laugh.", "NTA. This is karma at its finest.", "You're NTA. Your mother, whose genes contributed to her height, is an even bigger A-H than her immature boyfriend. She is allowing him to belittle you for something that is out of your control. That goes against every normal mother's maternal instinct.\n\nHer boyfriend is also a royal A-H for his constant,  tiresome comments about your height. They both have a lot of maturing to do, but at least they're perfect for each other.", "Dont dish it if you cant take it. This is the definition of karma. NTA", "NTA, great karma there", "NTA 100%. Although, as a short woman engaged to a short guy, I think your mom's bf is a total AH (and your mom as well for laughing at you and if she enables the teasing).

I have friends that are short and when they start joking about their height I either ignore it or say straight up that I don't care about height. That has stopped the comments from them about my height and theirs. We're closer for it I think. I think short men sometimes feel self conscious because of society. I tell people I hate being so tall and I get the shock face. Hitting your head is something I deal with a lot too. Rant over. Thanks for listening!", "I\u2019m honestly still giggling about this.

One of the reasons I grew into an adult who's not insecure about his height is thanks to her. \n\nParents should be trying to help their kids grow into well adjusted adults, not reinforcing insecurity and making it worse. \n\nNta", "And you can cross your legs all over the place on planes!
