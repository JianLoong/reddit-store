That has stopped the comments from them about my height and theirs. We're closer for it I think. I think short men sometimes feel self conscious because of society.

I didn't say it always worked.\n\nI fought back one time (actually about the stupidest issue, who gets to go through the door first).  I lost but it is what it is.  I surely wasn't relentlessly bullied because I didn't act out or give them a reaction (cool headed AF I like to say).  That's NOT to say nothing bothers me but not people so much.  Maybe I'm too boring to be an amusing mark.\n\nEndured other stuff too.  The one that stands out in my mind, I was a bigger kid (not THE bigger kid) at the time, my GFs friend told me \"you got bigger tits than I do\".  Still think about that one.  But yeah, that relationship didn't last long after that."]}
