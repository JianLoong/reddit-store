As a short person myself, I like to remind people that it's best not to piss off someone with easy access to their knees.", "NTA, he is allowed to make fun of your height, but you can't about his?", "NTA.  If he can give it, he should be prepared to take it.   Karma is a bitch sometimes. \n\nI would have said \u2018you\u2019re too big for this house big guy\u2019 but I\u2019m petty.", "NTA That's hilarious it's a shame that he's too tall that he forgets to duck when going into a room.", "NTA. They obviously can't see (or respect) the difference between emotional/physical hurt, and you're more laughing at the irony--that you have an ounce of schadenfreude mixed in doesn't make you TA.", "NTA and IMO, the doorway agreed ;)", "NTA dude this is FUNNY. That is HUMOR. He is TA", "NTA\nSounds like he can dish it out, but can\u2019t take it. People come in all shapes and sizes. Unfortunately, your mom\u2019s boyfriend sounds like a toxic fellow and now he transferred some of that to your mother. She should have some empathy for you and how this makes you feel.", "NTA!!!", "NTA, but he sure is.", "NTA. It's easier to be a short woman, but I reply to such comments with my advantages of being short. It's good to be short because I fit under the desk during and earthquake and I will never get deep vein thrombosis from sitting on a plane too long because I can stand up under the overhead storage. Admittedly it's a short list, but it makes me laugh.", "NTA. This is karma at its finest.", "You're NTA. Your mother, whose genes contributed to her height, is an even bigger A-H than her immature boyfriend. She is allowing him to belittle you for something that is out of your control. That goes against every normal mother's maternal instinct.\n\nHer boyfriend is also a royal A-H for his constant,  tiresome comments about your height. They both have a lot of maturing to do, but at least they're perfect for each other.", "Dont dish it if you cant take it. This is the definition of karma. NTA", "NTA, great karma there", "NTA 100%. Although, as a short woman engaged to a short guy, I think your mom's bf is a total AH (and your mom as well for laughing at you and if she enables the teasing). People who make fun of others for things they legit cannot help are insufferable.", "NTA but mom's BF sure is.
