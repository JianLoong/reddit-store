We were in the same HS class, then we went to the same college and became inseparable. Before people ask, it was a legit friendship. At times I had a small crush but nothing serious at all. We both had friends of our own gender but we\u2019re close till graduation. Mackenzie\u2019s senior year she started dating a guy who I really liked. They got married, I was invited, but right Mackenzie got pregnant I was dropped. We live in the same town and have mutual friends. But my text stopped getting replied too, my Snapchats went unopened. After a year I stopped reaching out and haven\u2019t spoke since. \n\nI heard thru the grapevine that Mackenzie and her husband divorced 3 months ago. 2 months ago I got a text from a random number (I deleted Mackenzie) asking if I\u2019d like to catch up. I never responded. I play softball Thursday nights and always go to this little sports bar afterwards. It is a spot that is off the beaten path so only regulars go there. There is a cute bartender I have banter with. It\u2019s lowkey and one of my favorite weekly traditions. \n\nStarting a month ago Mackenzie started coming in, usually with my friends GFs (small town, my friends date some of her friends). I would avoid her but it\u2019s a small place. She\u2019d try to engage me in conversation. I\u2019d make an excuse (bathroom, up in darts, closing my tab) whatever to get out of it. She multiple times asked to be my pool partner or asked me how softball was. I always said one word and tried giving every hint possible I wasn\u2019t wanting to talk. Thursday I\u2019m having a fun conversation with the bartender, and Mackenzie inserts herself in the conversation from across the bar. I rolled my eyes and just went to the back patio. Mackenzie followed me out there asking why I was being such a dick. I asked why she was even there. She said she wanted a drink after work and came with Sarah (friends GF). I said why this bar as there are plenty of other places. She said that she knew I liked this bar and wanted to check it out. I asked for her to find another bar because it was annoying. She said \u201cwhy are you such an asshole now\u201d. I said that I just had no desire to be friends and I don\u2019t want people thinking we are together so I\u2019d love it if she stopped hanging around me. She asked why and I said that she\u2019s only hanging around again because she is damaged goods. She cut me off for years and now that she\u2019s divorced she wants my attention again. She more than likely wants access back into my social circle that she lost. And that\u2019s why she is hanging with my friends GF, at a bar I frequent. That she wants something and I\u2019m not interested in helping her. She left after and that\u2019s when I got text from both my friends GF and another mutual friend calling me all this stuff.

If you don\u2019t want to be her friend, tell her that. Don\u2019t string her along (by ghosting her and then blowing up at her when she tried to re-engage). Additionally, if she\u2019s just gone through a divorce and having a child, chances are she\u2019s gone through a lot and, guess what, it\u2019s not always about you.", "YTA for the phrase 'damaged goods'. It has undertones of some really unpleasant views about women. \n\nYes, I think she treated you badly, but you completely lost the moral high ground when you said that to her.", "YTA - Damaged Goods makes you an ah but also for not understanding that a new mother probably has more important things to do than reply to snaps and texts.", "YTA. instead of writing all of this in a Reddit post, you could\u2019ve told her to her face. Instead you called her something terribly misogynistic. if you were hurt, you could\u2019ve talk to her about it instead of sitting there sulking.\n\nif you think it\u2019s for a reason, call her out on it. Or tell her you\u2019re not interested in any kind of interaction with her and move on. Go to another bar, remove yourself from the situation.", "Holy shit, YTA.\n\nYou just seem super bitter she wasn't interested in you as more than friends.", "YTA\n\nYou sound like you think you are all of that and a bag of chips. When someone gets married/has kids, dynamics change. I would argue Mackenzie is looking for friends and support during this time. She's trying to surround herself with old friends and probably move forward in her life. \n\nIt's ridiculous you think she's stalking you and reminder, she's been hanging out with her friend. YOUR FRIENDS HAVE TOLD YOU THAT YOU ARE WRONG.", "YTA for calling her damaged goods. I get why you were upset, but why not just say, \"Hey, it really sucked when you ditched me as a friend after getting a boyfriend, and I'm just not interested in being friends again.\" Simple as that. But damaged goods? Asshole thing to say.", "YTA. Believe me when I say that someone like you isn't worth being friends with. Not when you think that you can dictate where another person can go or act as if everything is about you. Guess what? It's not.\n\nIf Mackenzie wants to go somewhere, even a place you frequent, then she has every right to. Because a bar is a place of business, not your private oasis. She can try to reconnect with an old friend because maybe she realizes that she missed you. Not because she wants anything else from you.\n\nAnd then insulting her like that, oh yeah. Insult a woman like that, especially in a small town, and you can bet it's gonna come back to bite you. So don't be surprised if you find yourself lacking in the date department in the coming days.", "Wow YTA", "YTA, for sure. You have no clue what happened in the marriage to cause her to stop contact. There could have been any number of types of power and control in that relationship, whether it be physical violence,  manipulation,  coercion, financial control, or anything else. Sadly, you just straight up, blamed your friend without bothering yo find out. Then you go call her damaged goods. You might like to learn more about the impact on individuals when they have a marriage fail, and when you do, you'll learn just what an AH move it was", "You definitely are TA here.\nWhile I get being frustrated at her not taking your rather obvious hints of not wanting contact,\nit was waaay out of line to attack her verbally like you did.\n\nThere were multiple other ways of ending this conversation without stooping so low.", "YTA. That's a mean, ugly thing to say to someone just because she's divorced. You don't know whether her husband forced her to isolate from old friends. You don't know why they got divorced.", "YTA but I\u2019m pretty sure you already know that. The sad thing is, you say you were such good friends with this person, but didn\u2019t stop to think that maybe she stopped responding for a valid reason. Yeah, maybe she was just being a jerk, but she also could have been an overwhelmed new mom or dealing with postpartum depression or even a husband that was controlling and abusive. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying you have to be friends with her again or that you owe it to her to hear it out, but the anger you feel over the situation and how you expressed it makes it seem like this was ultimately not about a friendship; it was about feeling \u201crejected\u201d because you felt like her lack of responsiveness was proof she chose another man over you. \n\nAt the end of the day, if this was really about \u201cfriendship\u201d you wouldn\u2019t have called her \u201cdamaged goods\u201d and said you wouldn\u2019t want people to think you were together.", "YTA - big time. You don\u2019t have to be friends with her, but you could have handled it like an adult.", "YTA\n\nhahahaha holy crap dude you sure did carry your friendzone grudge for way too long. Pathetic.", "You aren't TAH for being mad, but you're TAH for using a misogynistic term like \"damaged goods.\"\n\nOne might also ask why you would call her that if you liked her just \"as a friend.\" You sound jealous.", "~~ESH.~~ YTA\n\nShe broke off the friendship all those years ago and now seems to be stalking you when you ~~clearly~~ demonstrated that you're not interested.\n\nHowever, referring to people as \"damaged goods\" is always AH behavior.\n\nEdit to change E S H to YTA.  Upon second reading, you actually could have been more clear and less evasive about not wanting to reconnect.  Use your words like a grownup (and without misogynist tropes like \"damaged goods\").", "YTA for a lot of things, like poor communication, like not being up front with her, like assuming a lot of things in your head...\n\nBut you're especially TA for saying she's damaged goods \n\nI hope you take this AITA post and learn from it and grow, because you've got a long way buddy.", "YTA. I don\u2019t understand what your issue is. You sound like a teenage boy throwing a tantrum after a rejection. Mackenzie never wronged you. Grow up. Pretty telling that you mention everyone else\u2019s SOs in this post and you don\u2019t seem to have one of your own. Probably the consequence of acting like an insufferable AH.", "Yes, YTA for calling her that. You don\u2019t know if she was in an abusive relationship and had to cut you off. You sound so hurt by it and it sounds like you had way more feelings than you\u2019re willing to admit. Don\u2019t argue with people trying to explain to you that you sound like a misogynist when using that phrase. \n\nCan you please ask the bartender what she thinks of you saying that and report back to us?", "YTA. That\u2019s quite possibly the harshest thing you could say to someone, especially someone who just got divorced.", "Yeah YTA 100%. Grow up.", "YTA. You have no idea what she has been through and instead of being an adult you decided to call her names. I mean who needs enemies when she has you as a \u2018friend\u2019. What a child you are. You could have heard her out and then said you didn\u2019t want to be friends, you could have politely said no. Nope you chose to be a dick because your ego was dented in the past.", "YTA Read your original post the mods kept up and holy shit you are delusional at best. All you had to do was be upfront versus passive aggressive \u201ceye roll\u201d and going to the bathroom to avoid her. She literally said she went to grab a drink with a girlfriend and you take it as stalking. You need to grow up and learn how to communicate like an adult versus a middle schooler lol You are the drama and the AH.", "YTA. You knew it was a hurtful thing to say, and yet you chose to say it. Pretty straightforward.", "YTA.\n\nShe obviously hurt you a lot, which sucks. But instead of dealing with it like a grown up and talking to her to hear her side, you ice her out and then snap at her. \n\nNobody is saying you should be friends but try to exhibit some maturity and ability to communicate my guy.", "YTA- you have no idea what even caused her to go MIA. It could have been an abusive situation. Or maybe her husband felt threatened by your close friendship (another form of abuse). Or maybe she just outgrew your sunshine personality.\n\nInstead of lashing out like you\u2019re in high school, you could\u2019ve had a real conversation with her.", "oh my god\u2026.\n\nYTA. point blank.", "YTA. Only for the \u201cdamaged goods\u201d part. A little for asking her to find a new bar but the context is there to support the assumption she\u2019s seeking you out so I get it. Nothing else would have been a problem. She\u2019s not damaged because her marriage didn\u2019t work out. She\u2019s not damaged because she chose a different path than you. You hit low to be a dick and you have to own that. The other stuff about avoiding her and not wanting that friendship anymore is valid.", "YTA. That was cruel AF, and yeah she cut you off, but damn, man. You could have been direct without being mean. You could also tell her that what she did hurt you, and that you\u2019re not looking to reconnect. But nope, you just demeaned her. I guess the good news is that she won\u2019t want any part of being around you in the future. But mostly, you\u2019re an AH for acting like a person who has been through a divorce is \u201cdamaged goods,\u201d both reducing a human to an object and acting like being divorced diminishes a person\u2019s worth. Do better.", "I understand why you don\u2019t want to be around her but the way you handled it makes you seem about 18 years old. And for that YTA.", "**She asked why and I said that she\u2019s only hanging around again because she is damaged goods.**\n\nLOL YTA  in what world would you not be????", "YTA, as well as a self-absorbed, self-entitled, immature, and delusional misery of a person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it's very culturally common for there to be a lot of pressure for het folks - especially women - to drop their opposite sex friends. There can be a lot of pressure from inside the relationship, and a lot of women feel a lot more vulnerable when they're pregnant. (For good reasons.) Ye gods, if you read this page you must know how frequently people are pressured into dropping their opposite sex friends / assumed to be fucking their opposite sex friends. \n\nIt sounds like you are making a lot of assumptions about how her life was going and why she stopped talking to you.

One would think she had backstabbed you or cheated on you or something. People lose touch all the time when they get married. So what? Even if you were initially a little cold to her and she persisted in trying to get close to you, you could have explained why you were hurt. Maybe she would have apologized.\n\nYou act as if she committed an unforgivable sin toward you, and based on what you wrote, I can't see why.

Your comment was misogynistic and you didn\u2019t even bother to find out why she stopped talking to you. Maybe her husband made her do that.

I don't get insulted when someone I haven't heard from in a year reaches out and asks to catch up. I don't know what's going on behind the phone. \n\nHell I had a friend a few months ago I haven't spoken to in two years say hey I just came across this and thought of you, how are you? We chatted for a bit no big deal. I'm not overly sensitive like OP.", "I actually said his attitude is way out of line, thanks though. It would be nice if people were very direct but that\u2019s not the case; it\u2019s why social cues exist. Otherwise we\u2019d have no facial expressions or body language. She had plenty and ignored them. Not sure why she\u2019s pushing so hard to spend time with this tool, but that\u2019s her prerogative.", "What's going on here as that we (the collective voice of Reddit) don't trust your perspective that this girl is stalking you because of your obvious arrogance and objectively terrible personality.", "Classic case of toxic men using progressive talking points to perpetuate more misogyny.", "Stalking? So far she\u2019s just gone to the same bar as you, and tried to talk to you when she\u2019s seen you. Yikes.", "**she insulted him first**", "And not everyone picks up on social cues well or understands them.", "Well said.", "Well let's face it, he's been a condescending AH who can't use his words properly or have an adult conversation. \n\nShe wasn't wrong by saying he was being an AH by rolling his eyes.", ">hursday I\u2019m having a fun conversation with the bartender, and Mackenzie inserts herself in the conversation from across the bar. **I rolled my eyes and just went to the back patio.**", "Weird how in your mind \n\nHer insulting him \u2705\ufe0f\n\nHim insulting her \u274c\ufe0f"]}
