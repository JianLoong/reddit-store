If you\u2019d said \u201che\u2019s ugly\u201d or even \u201che\u2019s average\u201d she would likely have been offended, and it\u2019s not like you said \u201comg he\u2019s so hot, I would definitely hit that\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She asked what you thought of him, you said he seemed nice, that obviously didn\u2019t satisfy her, so she then asked, what you thought of his looks. You gave an answer and a polite one at that. You didn\u2019t say he was hot or sexy etc. What kind of answer was she looking for?! If you had said he was ugly, she would have become defensive and angry and asked how you could say such a thing. I don\u2019t think there was anything \u2018right\u2019 that you could have said to be honest. She is obviously insecure and has jealousy issues. If you value the friendship enough and want things to get better between the two of you, I would confront her and ask what sort of answer she would have deemed acceptable. You weren\u2019t degrading, demeaning or rude in your reply in saying he was handsome and you definitely weren\u2019t into him and planning on flirting/stealing him from her. If she thinks you were, then this is a sign to end the friendship now to avoid future problems.", "That was a trap set by a jealous friend", "This doesn't sound like the whole story ...or your friend is trying to take you down a notch and finds you very pretty.", "What the fuck", "I'm sorry, but your friend is an insecure, immature idiot.  \nWhy are you even friends?  \nNTA OP.", "Ah, the no right answer questions. \n\nWhat do you think of my guy?\n\nHe's fine.\n\nNo, how does he LOOK?\n\nHe looks fine \n\nNO TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF HOW HE LOOKS??!!\n\nOk, he's a handsome guy.\n\nYou gross freak, wth you talking about my boyfriends looks???!!!!", "NTA she\u2019s a weirdo", "OP is your friend by chance a teenager?

So you hate him and think I'm ugly by association?\nHe cute.

That is ...kind of funny actually.  What a bizarre course of action for her to take.\n\nDoes she often try to start fights?", "NTA, she asked you a question with no right answer. Either you say he\u2019s not your type and insult her taste, or you say he\u2019s attractive and she accuses you of coming for her man.", "Yeah I'm wondering if she just wanted an argument", "I got that impression too... weird you ask, get a vague answer,  probe specifically about his looks then get bent when your friend says he's handsome?  What was she hoping for?  That she'd call the guy a troll and question her judgment in dating the guy?", "OP was damned either way", "And exhausting", "Seriously you\u2019re crushing if you say something nice and you\u2019d be mean if you were like, meh. \n\nLose-lose\n\nMaybe the third option was to say bf was mid and you have no opinion at all LOL\n\nNTA", "We're both 19", "NTA - I asked my friend the same question I wanted her to say he was handsome and validate my feelings lmao.
