My dad passed away when I was 2 years old. I\u2019m 24 now. My mom has never once taken off her wedding ring and has chosen to stay faithful to him.\nI don\u2019t have much memory of him, but I understand her choice. I\u2019m a wife and a mother myself now, and if I lost my husband, I would probably also choose to stay faithful (no judgement whatsoever to those who choose to move on though)\n\nMy mom is bipolar. She\u2019s on medication and goes to therapy, but she still has a breakdown every now and then.\n\nToday was my cousins baby shower. My husband was at home with our son so I drove there with my mom. While we were there, my aunt made a comment saying \u201cyou\u2019re not too late you know!\u201d To my mom. She got in her face and said \u201cwhat was the point of that? No, tell me. What was the point of that.\u201d Me and my cousin had to pull her away. \n\nMy aunt said she has to get over it. She said \u201cyou can still find another man and have one more, you\u2019re not too old yet. I\u2019m just being honest\u201d and she said \u201cI have a husband\u201d and my aunt said \u201cno you don\u2019t. Till death do you part! He is DEAD\u201d\n\nMy mom was starting to go into an episode. She \u201cI\u2019ll see him again.\u201d And my aunt said \u201cno you won\u2019t, and you only live once, so stop wasting it\u201d\n\nThat pushed her over the edge. She yelled \u201cYES I WILL. HES IN HEAVEN WAITING FOR ME! YOU'LL SEE! YOU'LL ALL SEE. ONE DAY YOULL ALL SEE!!\u201d And d I just grabbed her arm and took her to the car. No goodbyes, no thank yous we just left and went home.\n\nMy mom was still heated. She was crying too but I pretended not to notice. She was like \u201cone day they\u2019ll see. One day I\u2019ll be with him again forever\u201d and I just said \u201cyeah, you will. I know you will\u201d and she said \u201cthey\u2019ll all look stupid one day when we\u2019re all in heaven.\u201d And I just said \u201cyeah, one day you\u2019ll be with him again, and you\u2019ll be with him forever and ever.\u201d She was still rambling on saying \u201cthey\u2019ll never understand.\u201d And stuff like that.\n\nI said \u201cyeah, they never will, and that\u2019s ok\u201d\n\nWhen we got back to our house my aunt called me. Not my mom, me. I thought she was gonna apologize but she didn\u2019t, she just said my mom needs to grow up. I said \u201clook, you may not beleive in heaven, but we do. They will be reunited one day and if you don\u2019t want to beleive that that\u2019s fine, just keep it to yourself.\n\nAnd just like that, I am now not allowed to meet my cousins baby when she gives birth. My cousin won\u2019t talk to me, nobody will. I don\u2019t regret my decision one bit. In fact, it led to a great evening, because now I get to hang out with my mom, and she gets to hang out with her grandson.\n\nIt does still suck though I don\u2019t get to meet my new cousin, but be honest.

I don't really understand how your aunt got to the conclusion that it was a good idea to bring this up, when it's been decades and your mother is still faithful/in mourning (is your aunt bipolar too ?), but regardless someone smart would drop it after the first sign of resistance from your mother. If your mother doesn't want to or isn't ready to move on, what good is it to insist like that ? It accomplishes nothing, except upsetting her.\n\nI'm glad you were in her corner. Not only because you understand her on the matters of faith, but also because you didn't chalk up her response to her mental health, like I suspect your aunt does. You respect your mother's inner life and she needs someone like you in her corner. That makes you big time NTA.", "NTA\n\nI lost my husband about a decade ago.

Fuck, who am i to take away the one sliver of hope that she's clinging to?? To contradict this idea was a HUGE jackass move by your cousin. It doesn't matter how much time has passed. I did remarry, but even 10 years later, I still experience rough days (birthday/anniversary/etc) and bouts of grief myself, and to be honest I don't think that will ever go away.", "You are definitely not the asshole.

You were right to get her out of there and since your aunt has made the NC easy, continue it.

I agreed because of my girlfriend, only to come home from work a month later to finding all our shit on the curb, her Mother telling us she never loved her daughter and wanted us out now. Weeks later we find out she also gave up custody of her other three kids, willing because she was \"sick of dealing with them.\"\n\nSo I am naturally biased.
