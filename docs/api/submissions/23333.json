I think it's actually very selfish to ask anyone to take in their kid when they know they have two children already and are about to have an empty nest. And she could also go back to work to supplement the income for her son?  Spare me. You are so NTA at all. They also just assumed you all would let him live there hence no other arrangements were made for your nephew.", "NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for the nephew. You and your wife had a plan: the twins will go off to college and we\u2019ll enjoy our empty-nester stage. Which means having the house teenager-free for you to roam and enjoy as you wish. Just because you have room doesn\u2019t mean the room is available for the use of yet another teenager. SIL is responsible for her own child\u2019s accommodations. Actually she\u2019s TAH for expecting you to change your whole life for her kid. Good for you for staying firm, you deserve to enjoy your home, peace and privacy. Also, if your twins come home for a visit, their space is already gonna be taken over and that\u2019s not fair to them either.", "NTA\n\nand I'm sure Josh appreciates you declining, because he will surely have a more \"college life\" if he doesn't live with family", "Omg NTA!! Not even a little bit. I sympathize with the SIL and her kid but this is not on you. Enjoy your life", "NTA I understand wanting to be empty nesters. As parents we did our jobs and want to have some quite and peace.\n\nPlus life is unpredictable. What happens if one of your sons or both decide that the college they are going to isn\u2019t for them. It isn\u2019t fair to give up your kids rooms when they technically still live there. \n\nThey will come home. It may be at a time when the nephew is still there. It isn\u2019t fair for your sil to expect you to make one of your sons give up his room for her child.", "NTA. SIL doesn\u2019t want to work to support her kid (meaning give up the lifestyle she wants) but wants you to give up yours for her kid? Kick rocks SIL", "Nta Being related doesn't mean family has rights to your home.  Providing lodging is the parents and the students responsibility not the aunt and uncles. Sil is out of line here. She had the right to ask. You had the right to say no. Now she needs to shut up. She has no say so in\nwho lives in your home. Nephew can work to pay for his lodging.  I do. Not your responsibility to give up your dream of how you want to live to an entitled sil and nephew.", "NTA\n\nIdk how your relationship with your nephew was prior to this situation, if u even care to have a connection, but I would def recommend reaching out to him directly about this. It could be a good learning experience, maybe you can give him some advice or relevant knowledge about the cost of living and quality of life in your town. He is an adult now, he should be a part of the convo possibly affecting not only his living situation but possibly his familial bonds. God forbid your SIL poisons the well n skews newphew's view of yall's choice.\n\nSIL seems determined to make this your problem. Not really searching for a well rounded solution. Def think working with Nepew directly to find housing n safety is the best fit", "NTA was she planning on paying you for the added cost of another person in your house?", "NTA, no need to explain yourself and I hope they don't guilt trip you and your wife into changing your minds. \n\nI'm curious if those calling you a jerk wouldn't mind having a nephew moving in with them full time for all the college years when they had just gained some freedom and privacy. It's a huge commitment.", "NTA\n\nLetting others live with you, family or not, is a big commitment.  \n\nFrankly someone just starting just is least likely to be a good roommate and probably expect them to cook, clean etc.  Maybe not, but fast way for a lot more family drama\n\nHe can pick a better school or get a job.", "Probably against the grain, but I'm going to say NAH. Turning down your nephew for the reasons stated are valid. Is the SIL's attitude bad when you refused? Yes. I think you also are close to AH territory by saying SIL should take out a loan if they don't have cash. Her calling you an asshole for that comment could be valid if you're suggesting this problem is a failing on her part.\n\nThere's too many extenuating circumstances here. Nephew was expecting a scholarship and got refused because they are injured. SIL can't pay for tuition and room and board and needed help. This problem wasn't your making but they're taking it out on you. The real assholes are the school for pulling the scholarship, and a system that makes college prohibitively expensive for the next generation. Not everyone's parents can afford to send their kids to school. Student loans are also usually a very bad deal. It's a bad system, not a failure of individuals.\n\nBetter advice might have been to suggest nephew could go to a more affordable option closer to home and not take loans.", "NTA Your SIL assumed you would have two empty bedrooms - but will you? Your kids are off at college and in dorms, but they will be home for breaks and likely the summer. They likely left some things behind and probably don\u2019t want someone else in their space during that time. But even if they didn\u2019t care, it is still your home and there would be an expense of having nephew there as well as dealing with, essentially, a teenage/young adult roommate. She\u2019s pretty selfish for thinking your family, including your kids, should take on her and her son\u2019s financial problem.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

College is insanely expensive and a huge amount of money can be saved by not having to pay room and board. Your nephew also would likely be spending most of his time at school and using you guys as a place to crash, and you wouldn\u2019t have the same obligations as with your kids - it would be more like having a roommate, and he\u2019d likely make friends in school and find a living situation/apartment after the first year or so anyway. If your SIL or nephew would be willing to consider paying you some form of rent (which is way cheaper than room and board at school), I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth considering but again, you\u2019re not obligated. You\u2019re not the asshole, but it may be worth it to be a bit more considerate about the whole because, you know, in this economy some things are a lot harder than they should be and a lot of people have to ask for favors in an ideal world they wouldn\u2019t.", "NTA and you did Josh a favour.

Guess what tell him 1 year he will be gone most of the time.  \n\nMy uncle died last week, he lived with us for a year when I was a kid.  I never thought how much work it added for my parents, but I treasure the relationship.  \n\nMy wife's parents let her cousin live with them to attend college.  They didn't have much of a relationship before he moved in, but now they are super close.", "YTA kind of.. \n\n\n\n\nI stayed at my parents home until I was around 26, essentially completed college.  Yah.. that's too long, I am sure that's what you are thinking.. Really.. it is.   However, From the time I was 8 I was \"the man of the house\"  My father, though an excellent and capable man in every respect, and an excellent provider. was a quadriplegic.  Which meant I spent my youth as a workhorse in that house, and it continued long after.  I provided value to the home even if I was a pain in the ass and dampened the alone time. \n\n\n\n\n\nNow.. If the kid is expecting a free ride while he coasts through school, that's a different story.  If he is going to be there he should be contributing.  Paying his way.. this could be beneficial to you.   How much more time would you have if you had a live in caretaker for your property, house maid.. etc?   He benefits from cheap housing, you benefit from cheap labor.", "NTA\n\nWhy only freshman year? \n\nAll that said, I would consider it. I'm sure your nephew would prefer to be in dorms. It will be more fun, he will make more new friends, etc. It's prob pretty hard to accept that he will not be playing a sport as it is. \n\nIt really depends on what kind of kid he is. Would he benefit/ need help adjusting to living away from home? Can you help him really develop some independence? Would he be gracious and grateful or think it's no big deal? \n\nIs he a studious kid who will prob be at the library a lot, etc? What is he studying? If he is in something more demanding like engineering, he will be studying and in study groups etc a LOT of the time. \n\nI definitely think you are entitled to decline, but if you really think it could benefit HIM to live with you (for about 8 months) - I would consider it. It's not a whole year. Summer he would be away, holidays too no doubt (build that in to the agreement)- and yes, ask his parents to cover a good chunk towards food and expenses. \n\nOf course you can say it's a trial and if he really messes up, he's out next semester.\n\nYou really don't have to, but if you think they would be gracious and grateful and your wife wants to -- I think I would.

It is the best thing for a freshman to live in the dorms. It gives a much higher chance of graduating. It also allows him to live like he isn't a guest. The list of pros for the dorm lifestyle outweighs the financial part, even for those taking student loans.", "YTA.  Come on!  You have the room.  You and your wife can set boundaries and insist he buy and prepare his own food, adhere to quiet hours, etc.  It would be so easy to make a major difference in this young man's life and finances.\n\nSociety wouldn't function if we never did other people favors every now and then, especially easy ones.", "NTA. My guess is your nephew doesn\u2019t want it either.\n\nMy mother had a weird thing about doing something similar when I was finishing high schools.

On the one hand I do believe in helping family and it sounds like for OP this would be annoying but not the end of the world.  Then saying that they should just take out more loans is pretty rude, just say no, I\u2019m sorry.  Also I feel bad for OPs nephew who got injured.  On the other hand SIL was extremely rude and has no right to call OP a selfish AH and If this kind of reaction is typical for SIL I wouldn\u2019t be too inclined to help her out either.  Also who\u2019s to say 1 year wouldn\u2019t turn into 4, and once OP has agreed to the first year there would be even more pressure to agree to additional years. \n\nSo ESH in my opinion.", "But op isn't interested in cheap labor and want his privacy in his own house. \n\nAnd you were in your PARENTS HOUSE, NOT YOUR uncle \n\nNTA op", "Agreed. I worked full time, applied for 100s of scholarships, went to community college to state, took 20 units a semester to graduate sooner and still ended with 40g in debt.

You never enjoyed having children?  This is completely separate from your question but that just strikes me as such a bizarre thing to say.  Why did you even have kids?", "That\u2019s absolutely reasonable, but there might be better ways to communicate that to your SIL than a hard \u201cno\u201d. Like do you know of good apartments nearby with affordable rent? Have friends or neighbors looking to rent a room? Could you offer to have a policy that your nephew can come over for free dinner and to visit a few times a month? Have a buddy who\u2019d take your nephew on to do some part-time work that could go towards paying for his education? Little things like that can go a long way when it comes to showing you care and are taking her concerns seriously, but still preserve your well-earned right to being an empty nester.", "I get what you're saying, but OP seems pretty jubilant about being an empty nester. It gives me unhappy home vibes, that's all.", "The cheap labor was just a consideration that may not have been made.  \n\n\n\n\nI supposed it comes down to the generosity of the individual.  If a kid needed my help, and was overall a good kid, young adult really, who'd cause me no problems beyond taking up surplus space, I'm going to help him, and probably use him to my benefit while I do. He doesn't even have to be related.  Hell.. my brothers old room after he left got lent to a foster kid my parents took in for 3 years while I was doing college. \n\n\n\n\nI suppose you have a point though.. This is one of those..

Uncompassionate, uncharitable maybe.", "Enjoying having children and enjoying a home with just your spouse are not mutually exclusive", "These points are good but I would add a huge caveat; OP should NOT offer these suggestions UNTIL AND UNLESS his answer of NO is respected and accepted. \n\nToo often, these types of alternatives simply give an entitled aggressor  more ammunition to keep nagging, pleading and arguing.

I was the classic suburban sahm mom. I do miss my kids but I be lying if I said I love having the house\nJust me and my husband.\n\nI love doing what I want when I want.
