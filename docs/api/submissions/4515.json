All I can say is that her birth parents should have never been allowed to have kids.) Sam used the trauma that Chloe had from her birth parents against Chloe and used it to bully her.\n\nI told Sam I was absolutely disgusted with him. Sam kept making excuses that \u201cWell, having seven friends is better than only having three.\u201d I told Sam even if he would rather have seven fake friends than three real ones, then that\u2019s his own choice. But there\u2019s never any justification for bullying someone. Especially doing something as disgusting as using someone\u2019s trauma to make fun of them. Our parents grounded Sam for months. They tried making him go to therapy but stopped after a few sessions because Sam just refused to talk to the therapist.\n\nSam started high school this year.

Sam tried to go back to Chloe and the two friends who had supported her, but they made it clear that they wanted nothing to do with Sam.

Fortunately he is young enough to learn before he does that in a bigger way. The fact is that he traumatized a girl who was his close friend because he could.

Siblings can be wonderful mentors.\n2. He brought up the topic and you responded.\n3. He needs to hear some tough truths because his perspective is so very skewed. If you are able to have further conversations, some things you may be able to say include, (1) it sucks to be bullied and that how he feels is very much what he made his good friend Chloe feel. (2) he acted on a choice to play the percentages to his advantage instead of caring about right and wrong and plain decency to another human being; he is reaping the consequences of that \\[essentially, it's still his fault, but maybe better wording\\]. (3) Would he feel he should just forgive one of his bullies if that person comes to him a year later, suddenly wanting his friendship because the other friends dumped him? (4) Your brother has conveyed that he really isn't remorseful for how he treated Chloe; he just wants her to replace the friends he prioritized over her. Instead of forgiving him, she has all the more reason to want nothing to do with him.\n4. Maybe ask him/your parents if a therapist might be helpful now. He may be more open to it. Your brother has been ruled by anger for a while now. But maybe that the hurt is more at the surface for him; he may be a bit more willing to talk with someone.

Sam also needs to know that forgiveness doesn\u2019t mean someone is going to be your friend.", "NTA.\n\n\"One of the other people said that even though Sam was a bad friend, he has now also been a victim of bullying and he\u2019s been through enough punishment without me saying anything\"\n\nBut he hasn't learned anything from the experience. The fact that he's still calling Chloe a bitch and a \"self righteous victim\" shows that despite the punishment, the lesson hasn't sunk in yet. He's still at the stage where he needs some one to reinforce it and lay out the fact that this is the natural consequence of his actions, and if you don't do that, he's going to continue to deflect blame onto Chloe and he's likely to do the same thing again with future friends, because nothing is ever his fault.", "NTA\n\nSam got the taste of his own medicine", "NTA you had to tell him that he chose false friends over real ones and that they turned on him like false friends do, because he was placing the blame on Chloe, calling her a bitch etc. You had to talk to him to nip that in the bud. Because he could very well carry on through life blaming the consequences for his own actions on others and that really doesn't lead to a very good life, especially not for future partners and children.", "NTA you can't make his friends for him. Why are those other people even comment is on this situation? Consequences for your actions. It's not like Sam has social problems, he was doing just fine until he got bullied himself. I am in no way saying the bullies are doing the right thing (in fact, I think a talk with the principal is worth it.)\n\nTell Sam that this is what he was doing to Chloe and ask him to apologize *only* if he actually feels bad about it. Don't force it because he won't be sincere.", "NTA- Sam needed a dose of reality. He screwed up. He became a bully. He has no friends due to his own actions. All you did was put the brakes on whilst he was having himself a pity whinge/being delusional. 14 is old enough to be held accountable for one\u2019s actions.", "NTA, I don't think he was punished enough if he can't even see that what he did was wrong. He's not even remorseful for what he put Chloe through, just angry that she won't magically forgive him now that he's going through it. I'm glad your parents seem reasonable at least.", "NTA.\n\nListen, being a sibling is more than just having fun together. Sometimes, we need to hold them accountable along with our parents to confirm how serious the issue is. It seems your parents discipline didn\u2019t get through to him, so you had to speak up on their behalf. Good for you.\n\nSam now sees how Chloe felt and needs to learn that people aren\u2019t obligated to surround themselves with those that have caused them pain. Chloe may have forgiven him but she won\u2019t forget how he used her trauma against her to get brownie points from his bullies. Honestly, I would do the same as her.\n\nRemind your friends that as Sam\u2019s sibling, you have a job of making sure he doesn\u2019t make bad choices and vice versa. It\u2019s clear your parents thinking wasn\u2019t getting through to him, so someone else who loves him had to be straight up. Hiding the truth from people does nothing but set them up for failure.", "NTA. Hopefully karma has taught him something", "NTA something about stones and glass houses", "NTA if not you then who your sam older sibling and what you said is true it is his fault and if no one keeps pointing it out he wont learn tell those people to mind there business and maybe drop them.", "NTA. He\u2019s 14. That\u2019s old enough to learn. What are you gonna wait until he becomes an adult and does something criminal? Tough love.", "Agreed. He's just a little brat now, but he's on his way to incel territory if he keeps going this way.", "People forget that the right kind of peer pressure can encourage social growth.", "That\u2019s what he reeks of: incel territory! I was wracking my brain to figure out what he reminded me of.", "NTA. let him slide on this stuff at 14 and he'll end up a crappy human being. Good for you.", "Oh Karma. He fucked around and found out. NTA", "How is explaining the consequences of Sam's actions to him discipline?  He got his dose of karma.  Hopefully he will learn from this and be better in the future, though I worry he will head downa  more incel-y path.  NTA", "NTA at 14 I was horribly bullied by my friends, I thankfully had other friends, but I know for a fact that one them had her older sister tell her she was being a dick\nHe\u2019s already not accepting what he did, well done to you and your parents for actually saying something", "NTA - YWBTA if he hadn\u2019t said anything but he\u2019s still calling her a bitch and tearing her down and victim blaming. Call him out every time.", "NTA How else were you supposed to say it? Karma is my boyfriend?", "NTA. Have you ever heard the phrase Learn by my words or by the hard way. Sam chose the hard way he decided to be a bully and now he doesn't like it because all of a sudden the message turned to him, he's getting exactly what he deserved. TBH every bully needs to be knocked down a peg that's how people realize you're never going to be anything but a bully.", "NTA \n\nliterally what is the point of a sibling if not calling you out on your shit as exactly as anyone can (because of shared life experiences) but also being reliable and consistent because family. \n\nIt sounds like you pointed him at good things.", "NTA. First you didn't discipline him - you told him that he did this to himself.\n\nI had a similar experience in high school to your brother - my best friend and I ended up in the same class as my friends cousin, and I was incredibly jealous so I bullied the cousin for quite a lot of the first year. The next four years were spent with very few friends - in the end I was friends with people a year younger than me. And I know it was my own fault and due to how I behaved.", "What you said is exactly how I hope my eldest would respond to their little brother if he pulled that crap. All I know is that if I was your mum I would be so proud of you (and disappointed in him). You are awesome and ignore the haters. Your parents support you so I assume they think the same as me!", "NTA. You told Sam all the right things. Your parents also told him pretty much the same. Your friends are wrong here.", "NTA.  \n\nYour brother needed to be the friend he needed to have.  Instead, he chose to bully the friend he needed to have.  \n\nIt\u2019s a rough and vivid illustration of interpersonal fafo and he\u2019s learning it young enough to have the opportunity to self correct, if he doesn\u2019t get coddled and comforted into believing his choices were just fine.", "NTA. Sam has learned a valuable lesson. Although it might appear he also has not. By labeling his ex friend Chloe, like he did, he is denying the role he had in hurting her. His anger is more about how he didn\u2019t get a free pass for his behavior and the trauma he perpetrated then how Chloe was hurt. To me this is a big red flag. In addition to his statement about having seven versus three friends. He seems to lack empathy. If this is the case, then I think there\u2019s a lot more to be concerned about. Even after experiencing what Chloe did, he\u2019s mad that she didn\u2019t forgive him. There\u2019s not one statement that you made that indicates he feels bad about his part and how he made her feel. To me this is huge. And if this is not identified, and redirected, or corrected, then he\u2019s going to grow up with the propensity to hurt others. And he\u2019s going to lead a very lonely, angry life.", "NTA: He did a crappy thing and now had to pay the price for his behavior. You just told him the truth. Thank you for pointing out everything to your brother who happens to be a bully", "NTA your \"friends\" are full of crap and they know it. I'm betting they're either bullies themselves or very entitled. No one likes the truth thrown in their face but sometimes that's whats needed to wake someone up. Maybe he'll make better decisions going forward.", "what lesson has he learned though? he still thinks he is the victim here. it does not sound like he has learned any lesson.", "Yep.\nThere's a reason people say \"X was like an older brother/sister to me\".\nOlder siblings can teach by example in a way that parents never can. They're also in a position to give a kid a piece of their mind in a way that will sound like \"just another lecture\" from a parent.\n\nOP did exactly what was needed. NTA.", ">He's just a little brat now, but he's on his way to incel territory if he keeps going this way.\n\nCould you kindly elaborate this \"incel territory\", just to be sure I'm on the same page as you? What do you mean by that?"]}
