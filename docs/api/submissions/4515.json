They were friends until last year when someone else in the friend group got a boyfriend. It was pretty typical teenage drama: The girl\u2019s boyfriend was making comments about how he thought Chloe was hot, so the girl demanded that Chloe be shut out of the friend group rather than dealing with her boyfriend. \n\nMost of the other people in the friend group started to bully Chloe, they would follow her around at school just to bully her. Instead of standing up to the bullies, Sam joined them. (Chloe is being raised by her aunt and uncle. I can\u2019t get into all the details here. All I can say is that her birth parents should have never been allowed to have kids.) Sam used the trauma that Chloe had from her birth parents against Chloe and used it to bully her.\n\nI told Sam I was absolutely disgusted with him. Sam kept making excuses that \u201cWell, having seven friends is better than only having three.\u201d I told Sam even if he would rather have seven fake friends than three real ones, then that\u2019s his own choice. But there\u2019s never any justification for bullying someone. Especially doing something as disgusting as using someone\u2019s trauma to make fun of them. Our parents grounded Sam for months. They tried making him go to therapy but stopped after a few sessions because Sam just refused to talk to the therapist.\n\nSam started high school this year. About a month ago, some more popular kids started making fun of Sam and Sam\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d group also started bullying him. Sam tried to go back to Chloe and the two friends who had supported her, but they made it clear that they wanted nothing to do with Sam. Sam was ranting to me while I was trying to make food in the kitchen about how Chloe was a bitch and that \u201cshe just wants to be a self-righteous victim\u201d because she didn\u2019t forgive him.\n\nI told Sam that it\u2019s his own fault he doesn\u2019t have any friends right now. He sided with a bunch of bullies and became one. He only came to Chloe and stopped talking to the bullies after he became the target. He needs to stop blaming other people and accept that he screwed up. Besides, his second semester\u2019s starting soon. He\u2019ll be able to join clubs and meet new people that way. He is still able to make new friends and treat them well.\n\nMy parents agreed with what I said and told Sam similar things. But then one of my friends and two other people told me that I was wrong to tell Sam that it\u2019s his own fault he doesn\u2019t have any friends. One of the other people said that even though Sam was a bad friend, he has now also been a victim of bullying and he\u2019s been through enough punishment without me saying anything. My friend and the other person said that it wasn\u2019t my place to say what I did because Sam\u2019s still only 14 and I should have left any discipline to my parents. I can see their points, but still feel I was justified.

Wanted to address this part:\n\n> and I should have left any discipline to my parents.\n\nAs far as I can tell, you didn't attempt to discipline Sam. You just pointed out that he's reaping the whirlwind and suffering the consequences of his own choices and actions. Seems reasonable to me.", "NTA\n\nThis is called the \"finding out\" stage. Hopefully he learns some important lessons. Unfortunately, given that he immediately went to calling Chloe a bitch for not doing what he wanted (taking him back as a friend) instead of genuinely apologizing to her and trying to be a better person / friend, it doesn't seem he's learned the right lessons yet, and you sugar coating the truth isn't gonna help him get there.", "NTA and for parents of bullied kids everywhere,  thank you.", "NTA.

That's just not how life works.  He's suffering the consequences of his actions.  You need to make sure he understands that.

He's not going to associate this bullying with his bullying of Chloe without you connecting those dots.
