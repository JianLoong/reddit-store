{"id": 30276, "submission_id": "17ncqr6", "title": "AITA for asking my brother\u2019s wife if she\u2019s still on Tinder?", "selftext": "First post so I hope I\u2019m doing this right. Names have been changed. :)\n\n   My (19F) brother (Alec 27M) has been dating his girlfriend (Kate 27F) for the past three years. He has openly expressed his opinion that he does not see himself marrying this girl for a few reasons: He does not feel the relationship is equal (she does not contribute financially nor does she do any housekeeping), she relies on him for EVERYTHING, and to this day actively cheats on him via Tinder. \n\n   Kate and Alec met on Tinder. She is bisexual and my brother is straight. We met her for the first time about a year into their relationship. My parents and I had a bad vibe from her from the start. She made comments to me about him, saying how he \u201cdoesn\u2019t give her any attention\u201d and she even went as far as to say, \u201cWe should totally go shopping! Alec will pay for it!\u201d I felt extremely uncomfortable and thought maybe she\u2019s using him for his money. I told my parents about this and they were appalled. We all made an effort to be nice to her and make her feel welcome despite this. However, my parents spoke to my brother privately and advised him to talk to Kate about this. My brother said he wasn\u2019t worried about it since he wouldn\u2019t be marrying her. Their relationship continued with Kate inviting herself along on our summer vacation, expecting Alec to cover everything (She was not working and refused to get a job because she \u201cpreferred to stay at home.\u201d). My brother put his foot down and said she couldn\u2019t come unless she got a job and covered her portion. She complained and whined but she eventually did. While on our vacation, we were all wandering around this jewelry store and she comes over to me and says, \u201cYou know, I need the female energy in my relationship. That\u2019s why I\u2019m on Tinder sexting women. Oh but don\u2019t worry, we never like meet up and do anything. And Alec knows about it!\u201d When I tell you I was SHOCKED. I wanted to tell my brother but my parents said to hold off so I did.\n\n   Now. We are about three years into the relationship. He was heartbroken and tried to move on. He was single for about two weeks. Kate and Alec keep in touch and decide to meet up to talk. The day they met up, they decided to get married. My parents and I didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea seeing as the reason they broke up was because neither of them want marriage with the other and they had too many problems within the relationship to continue. But we are his family and we will support him. We went to the courthouse and witnessed their \u201cspur of the moment\u201d wedding. We went to dinner after and I casually asked, \u201cSo, Kate, are you still on Tinder?\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to answer, she stuttered and said, \u201cW-what? Tinder? I-..\u201d My parents aren\u2019t super mad and neither is my brother. Alec just laughed and Kate wouldn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the night. I honestly didn\u2019t mean it in a bad way but I feel like I screwed up.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699067917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ncqr6/aita_for_asking_my_brothers_wife_if_shes_still_on/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not protective of Alec - if you wanted to protect him you\u2019d have said it BEFORE the legalities were performed. To do it right after is spiteful or drama creating.   \n\n\nSure, the whole thing is DOOMED, but no one wants to start a post nuptials meal with Tinder. That\u2019s just rude.", "YTA for two reasons:\n1. not speaking immediately with your brother about her Tinder habits. You knew he would not condone it and didn't say anything.\n2. spilling the beans in the worst possible moment, while they were celebrating their union. What was the point of that? They already got married and your revelation sounds like a late attempt to clean your conscience and create troubles for your SIL. It was just mean.", "YTA\n\nHowever poorly you may think of your new sister in law, that was an awful thing to say and bring up on the wedding day. Very nasty and mean spirited.", "YTA, but you're a good AH, and it had to be done sooner or later.\nI bet it felt goooooooood.\n\nKeep an eye on her and keep us updated.", "Bruh you can\u2019t save him from himself. He wants this life.", "NTA \nYou not wrong for trying to protect your brother , you know what they say once a cheater always a cheater so I\u2019m pretty sure she is still on tinder", "YTA\n\nYour brother has made his bad decisions, knowing they are bad decisions. So it's time to mind your own business.", "YTA\n\nYou 100% meant it in a bad way, at least take ownership of your actions. There was zero reason for you to say it other than stir up trouble and humiliate Kate.", "You kind of are the AH but it\u2019s funny as hell!!! And your brother laughed about it?!\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Yea YTA, cause once you went to the wedding and decided to support this relationship, you lost the right to stick your nose in and try to start trouble.", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t mean it in a bad way, you have nothing to take ownership for. There was every reason to say it, Kate shouldn\u2019t have felt so humiliated", "Petty AF, i kinda like it, but soft YTA for saying it in front of everyone, intent is irrelevant. \n\nWatch yourself going forward, respect their relationship. Kinda late to volunteer any information now, shoulda done that a while ago, but if bro asked, you should come clean. Guaranteed he\u2019ll ask if he doesn\u2019t already know about it.", "Seems to me that you are way too concerned with your brother's relationship. I would step back and let them be.", "NTA", "NTA I have little to no respect for cheaters unless they are cheating in an abusive relationship. Sounds like Alec was a solid guy, and she constantly used him so I do not feel bad for her at all LOL. It was a funny joke and if she was able to joke about sexting other women WHILE IN A RELATIONSHIP, she should be able to have a joke thrown her way about that. Sounds to me like she can dish it out but not take it and that\u2019s a her problem not a you problem.", "NTA. It probably won't blow up but I think that depends on if she wants to drop it and if you want to push the tinder subject.\n\nI'm guessing your brother took your comment as a Joke. Asking someone who just got married if they're still on tinder etc. And I'm also gonna guess that Kate did NOT tell him she was sexting women on tinder.", "Nta the marriage isn't going to last anyway", "that was petty af, but not full on ah.  plus super funny!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
