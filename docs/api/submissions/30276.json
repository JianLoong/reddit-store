Names have been changed. :)\n\n   My (19F) brother (Alec 27M) has been dating his girlfriend (Kate 27F) for the past three years. He has openly expressed his opinion that he does not see himself marrying this girl for a few reasons: He does not feel the relationship is equal (she does not contribute financially nor does she do any housekeeping), she relies on him for EVERYTHING, and to this day actively cheats on him via Tinder. \n\n   Kate and Alec met on Tinder. She is bisexual and my brother is straight. We met her for the first time about a year into their relationship. My parents and I had a bad vibe from her from the start. She made comments to me about him, saying how he \u201cdoesn\u2019t give her any attention\u201d and she even went as far as to say, \u201cWe should totally go shopping! Alec will pay for it!\u201d I felt extremely uncomfortable and thought maybe she\u2019s using him for his money. I told my parents about this and they were appalled. We all made an effort to be nice to her and make her feel welcome despite this. However, my parents spoke to my brother privately and advised him to talk to Kate about this. My brother said he wasn\u2019t worried about it since he wouldn\u2019t be marrying her. Their relationship continued with Kate inviting herself along on our summer vacation, expecting Alec to cover everything (She was not working and refused to get a job because she \u201cpreferred to stay at home.\u201d). My brother put his foot down and said she couldn\u2019t come unless she got a job and covered her portion. She complained and whined but she eventually did. While on our vacation, we were all wandering around this jewelry store and she comes over to me and says, \u201cYou know, I need the female energy in my relationship. That\u2019s why I\u2019m on Tinder sexting women. Oh but don\u2019t worry, we never like meet up and do anything. And Alec knows about it!\u201d When I tell you I was SHOCKED. I wanted to tell my brother but my parents said to hold off so I did.\n\n   Now. We are about three years into the relationship. He was heartbroken and tried to move on. He was single for about two weeks. Kate and Alec keep in touch and decide to meet up to talk. The day they met up, they decided to get married. My parents and I didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea seeing as the reason they broke up was because neither of them want marriage with the other and they had too many problems within the relationship to continue. But we are his family and we will support him. We went to the courthouse and witnessed their \u201cspur of the moment\u201d wedding. We went to dinner after and I casually asked, \u201cSo, Kate, are you still on Tinder?\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to answer, she stuttered and said, \u201cW-what? Tinder? I-..\u201d My parents aren\u2019t super mad and neither is my brother. Alec just laughed and Kate wouldn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the night.

If your decision is that you\u2019ll put up with being around Kate sometimes for the sake of having a relationship with your brother, you need to commit to it.
