It's about half the size of my current office. We also have both a large guest bedroom and another similar sized small room that we currently use mostly as storage. I recommended she use the small room to set up a secondary desk and storage. I figured this could be nice since she often has several projects going at once and would have to store one away for the other(s). She however insists that a bigger room would be the only real choice.

I also actually use the extra space to be more effective and focused. \n\nObviously now my wife is very angry with me and says the only thing that will calm her is if I give her the bigger room.

It\u2019s logical for you to have the largest space, as you use it the most (and to bring income to both of you).  The next largest space has equal reasoning to go to her or guests.  I\u2019m definitely inclined to lean towards her since 1) she lives there and 2) is actively using it 20 hours per week (vs guests who aren\u2019t always actively in the room).  \n\n\nUltimately it should be her decision whether to take two smaller rooms or the larger guest room for herself.  But you have very clear logic for using the office for yourself.  I\u2019d focus the conversation on how you want her to have first choice of the available rooms (your office is simply not available).", "NTA: OP, Absolutely not! This is indeed the hill to die on. This is your house and your career. Your wife's hobbies and guests to not take primacy over your ability to earn a living. If your wife needs a bigger playroom, then she can figure out the logistics and maybe earn the money to get a space. I hope you two aren't having children any time soon. Your wife is unbelievably self-centered.", "Info:  there are two large guest rooms, am I understanding this correctly, one of which you use as your office?  I don't think guest would care about the size of the room.  Is there another reason why you specifically want to make her use a smaller room for her space?", "As an avid crafter, crafting is a hobby that can very easily get out of hand supply wise. She may need to go through her supplies and purge some things. NTA, work is more important than a hobby.", "NTA. This is total BS. Your guests can SLEEP AT A HOTEL!!! You are working. There is no debate here. Clear answer.", "Your wife is acting selfish. She should take the guestroom since it wouldn't be used daily like an office or craft room. Her logic makes no sense to me. NTA.", "I'm going to go with nta.\n\nShe already had a room and outgrew it. That's fine, things accumulate over time and some hobby items take up a lot of real estate  You guys eventually agreed on her using the guest room only for her to change her mind. \n\nIs she going to move all her hobby things into your office or does she want what is your office and the other room she's already converted?\n\nMy thing is... Will this be the last time she takes another room for her hobbies?  I'm not ragging on her for having hobbies but if you have to take up multiple rooms for a hobby when you share a house with other people, especially when one works from home... that's kind of an asshole thing to do. Especially when the room you want is literally a workspace. You'd be giving up a whole room you spend 50 hours in for your income for a maybe parttime hobby project.\n\nDo you have a large yard, OP? Is there any way you can add an addition or a wired shed that would be large enough to house her hobbies? My friend is big into woodworking which means lots of stuff so she got a shed she could work in without taking over her garage or house. Maybe it'll be a good compromise? She gets a place to do her hobbies with everything in one place and it frees up the house for other things.", "NTA, how big is your back yard? Make her a nice studio out back maybe.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, your income will always be more important than hobbies. Period. No job, no house, utilities, groceries. Very simple.\n\nSecond, as someone who is part of a long line of creative hobbyists who just can't stop learning skills and buying tools and zomg-supplies-are-on-sale-I-must-buy-enough-for-a-year, space is not the problem. If you get a bigger space, it will just be filled and you're shortly back in the same problem.\n\nIdeally, your wife need two things. One, workspace for the projects. A table, good lighting, ability to not be tripping over yourself as you move through the space, etc. If she has multiple projects going at a time, she should be able to store them in progress in the workspace. Otherwise, out of sight is out of mind and you have a ton of UFOs taking up space: unfinished objects.\n\nThe second issue is storage. And this doesn't need to be in the workspace, and it's not always ideal to have them together. Ideally this is set up so that everything is safely stored and easy to access. This could be done in tubs in a basement rather than a dedicated craft room. But this is where your wife has to be honest with herself and set limits. Once she's maxed her storage out, that's it. She has to use materials to make room for new things. Otherwise, the storage will creep and creep and creep, squeezing out more and more space from the rest of the house and its occupants.", "Info - is there an alternate space that could function for her needs - a basement, attic, garage, or shed? Your space is functional for you as is, and I agree that you should not have to give that up. For the frequency of your guests and their comfort, them getting the bigger craft room back makes sense - however as functional as your space is for you is how much her small room doesn\u2019t function for her. Maybe thinking beyond the proposed rooms could help a compromise", "Probably around 20 hours a week, mostly on the weekend.", "To be honest so far our marriage has been pretty much perfect and we are usually very good about communication and finding compromises as we initially did. Her demand honestly came out of nowhere aswell as her refusal to find a solution together.\n\nI still have hope that we can resolve this quickly but if we can't maybe couples therapy is not a bad idea.", "We do have guests over quite frequently. On average about 3-5 nights a months I'd say. My in-laws also usually stay two weeks over Christmas and a week for easter since they are very religious.", "I agree.\n\nA guest room doesn't need much more than space for a bed and to put down your bags.\n\nThe second-smallest room is unlikely to be too small for that.", "I've answered this in another comment but she's actually very organized. Since she has so many different hobbies that all need a fair amount of supplies she has definitely outgrown her space.", "Mostly no. Though her making most of the gifts for family and friends birthdays/Christmas does probably save us a fair bit of money. \n\nShe has also occasionally sold paintings and clothing to coworkers. To be honest I don't really know how much she has made.", "Her parents are in their late 50s and travel more than ten hours to be with us twice a year. I've always thought they deserve to have a nice space to relax and enjoy their time with us. \n\nAlso most of the relatives from my side of the family that visit us do so to be with us when we often can not due to our jobs not to get free accommodation.", "I would love for most of our guests to stay longer and feel as comfortable as possible. Why wouldn't I? \n\nMost of them are close family members who live too far away to see them regularly and can only stay a couple of days anyway due to their jobs and other commitments.", "Good question. You're right, I guess it isn't really. I just thought I'd mention how we got the house and how long we've been married etc.. (We probably wouldn't be married yet if it wasn't for the visa issues since neither of us is too fussed with marriage as an institution.) \n\nAlso people are usually very interested in our backstory and how we were able to 'afford' a house of this size so young.", "I've answered this in another comment but pretty frequently. About 3-5 days a month.", "She's actually very organized. Just has many many hobbies most of which require quite some space for tools, paints etc..", "I consider myself very lucky to have inherited the house. I know many other people my age don't have that luxury I am very aware of this. \n\nBut for the record both of us weren't keen on getting married due to viewing it as an outdated tradition and us as too young, but it was the only logical solution to us at the time. She hated the idea more than I did. Still I will say that outside of this issue I am very happy and don't regret a thing.", "This is not a productive way to approach issues in a marriage.", "I've answered this in another comment. I realize that it probably wasn't necessary information. I guess it's just something we get asked a lot when meeting new people that I thought I'd mention it. \n\nAlso we probably wouldn't yet be married if it wasn't for the visa issues.", "Yes she works full-time. And outside a few birthday gifts I've never directly contributed to her hobbies. I spent a fair amount on my hobbies too so we both prioritize them over spending money on travel, fancy dining etc..", "No, whilst I was initially unhappy with the idea of her using the guest bedroom and suggesting she use two small rooms (with a bigger combined footprint) we comprised and I gave her the go ahead to use the guest room. However she changed her mind and ended up agreeing with me that it would be nice for our guests to have a bigger room. But instead of the guest room she now wanted my office as her craft room and for me to move into one of the smaller rooms instead. \n\nAlso I'd argue we have guests over more than most people and we host her parents twice a year who have to travel quite far to get to us. \n\nI've already answered twice why I mentioned the visa in other comments. I agree now that it may have been a mistake. I obviously don't want to imply that she is not deserving of the house and space in it.", "There probably should have been better punctuation in there, but op gave into her taking the large guest room for her craft room despite having reservations about it. It was after that that she started insisting on taking the office because she realized the smaller guest rooms were on the small side for guests", "Yea you did read it wrong she wants his office", "The small rooms are on opposite sides of the hallway so sadly no. There is a dining area but if walled off probably wouldn't be much larger than her current setup. I also doubt this is something she'd want since we regularly host dinner parties. \n\nI figured her using the second small room or the guest bedroom would fit her needs as we initially agreed. \n\nOther comments have mentioned couples therapy which might be a good idea if this doesn't get resolved soon.", "No, she's from a central european country and transferred to my college. Because her field is quite niche she had trouble finding a job at first. To make things easier for us we married.", "We compromised on her using the guest bedroom. She later went back on wanting to use that room because she agreed on wanting our guests to have that space. After this she demanded the office. The other small room would be more than big enough to accommodate all her extra stuff and another workspace with room to spare. \n\nHer using the guest room would still be ok for me since I agreed to it before even though I don't think it's ideal.", "OP said they initially said no but then gave in- the wife *is* in the big guest room. She just outgrew that new space and now wants the even bigger room that is OP\u2019s office. She also wants the guest room to go back from her craft room to the guest room + OP to take the small room that was her original craft room.", "We have a master, one guest bedroom, my office all of which are a similar size and two smaller rooms one of which is her current craft room. \n\nI'd say our house is a pretty average size. At least for our area.", "Still NTA.", "Yep, so 50 is bigger than 20...  you \"win\"...  though there's probably no way to actually win this one.\n\nIf you wife doesn't understand how unreasonable her request is, I don't know how you explain it to her...  jobs take precedence over hobbies every time, period.\n\nShe probably sees all the \"toys\"/extra stuff on the shelves as unnecessary to your work.  So when she looks in the room, she sees \"half\" of it being necessary for your office and the rest being fun stuff and thinks an office that's half the size would be fine.  You can attempt to explain the role that pacing plays in your creative work process, but who knows it she'll chose to understand that.\n\nYour wife isn't really being logical here, so it's hard to figure out how to get her to understand.  Perhaps she just doesn't like the feeling of being in that smaller space, and doesn't know how to explain she just doesn't like the feeling of the room, but it's still not on you to give up your office.  Perhaps you can talk about storage and design options for her current space and the other room?  Are there parts of walls that could be knocked down to create an opening/doorway between the two smaller rooms?  (either for her work space or for a better guest room configuration)?  Can you afford to give her a budget to \"makeover\" the space?", "Does she have a job? If not, maybe this is some weird thing where she sees her hobbies as her way of \"contributing\"/Doing something that's not just being a housewife. I still think her reaction is very uncalled for, but that's the only thing I can think of that would explain why a woman who's usually good at compromising would make this a hill to die on.\n\nIf she does have a job, then I'm even more perplexed. Have you tried talking to her about why this is so important she thinks you need to give up your workspace for it? If she's making money off of her crafting, would it be in the budget to rent out a space for her somewhere?", "Do you have a basement?  That space would be quite large for her.", "Who is more important-the person that lives with you-or somebody that visits for a few days?", "The fact that you led with those issues makes me think that you think that the home is your home and that you should have authority because you inherited it. It also implies that you feel she should be grateful to you for getting her visa and as such you should win all debates.\n\nWhile I agree with you on the important of the home office I feel that your attitude means yta.", "If that\u2019s all is it, that\u2019s fine, no issue.  But if it at all factors into your thinking (even subconsciously) about how space in the marital home should be shared, that would be really problematic.", "Here's a thought, then: she's living in your country, in your grandparents' home. Maybe she's digging in on this because she wants to feel in control of something? Not in a bad way, but just in the sense of feeling some sense of agency and having something that's hers because she wants it that way, not because of circumstance.", "It seems he\u2019s tried and she insists only his office will do but he uses it to earn a living, 40 house a week.  She literally wants him to move out for a bigger craft room.  Why? There\u2019s seems to be a lot of other rooms.  Sometimes you can\u2019t have it your way.", "Ok, now I understand. Unless by 'ended up agreeing with me' you meant: 'I talked and talked until she just gave up.'\n\nLook, just give up the large guest room - ok, her parents come over. They'll be fine in the smaller room.", "Make the small room your bedroom, and use it just to sleep in. \n\nYou have the rest of the house to hang out in.", "So she doesn't work", "Sounds like a \u201cyes.\u201d Eastern Europe is the new Asia.", "i guess you earn more money, so stay your ground. it is not ideal to give up your working space for her hobby of painting or whatever she does. also if she is polish this will not end here, some cultural thing happens with polish women that they start to take away all of your comfort areas slowly.", "She works full-time though she does spent about 20 hours a week on her crafts. \n\nI am very hopeful that we can soon work this out through communication. I was only looking for some more perspective on here since I'm unsure of whether me standing my ground on the room was a bad move. \n\nWhilst she doesn't make much money through her crafts the idea of renting a space is really not bad and maybe a potential for compromise.
