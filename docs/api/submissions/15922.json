Alexis is transgender, and came out two years ago. It\u2019s been a pretty big adjustment, especially for the older folks, particularly my grandmother, who is in her 90s and has mild dementia. \n\nRecently, my daughter had her seventeenth birthday. She already had a fun day out with friends planned, but my sister (who lives with my grandma and is her main carer) suggested we have a family birthday party at grandma\u2019s house as well, and Alexis thought it was a great idea. \n\nBy all accounts, the party went great, until it was time for cake. Now, baking has always been my grandma\u2019s passion, and even in her old age, she still bakes and decorates cakes all on her own. She usually makes them for family gatherings, and takes a lot of pride in her work. My sister brought out the cake, and the frosting read *Happy Birthday, [Deadname]!* \n\nAs soon as she saw the cake, Alexis started crying, and I quickly gathered our things and we left in a hurry. We had box cake and icecream while we watched her favorite movie, and I eventually got her feeling better. \n\nWhile that was happening, my phone blew up with texts from my sister, but I put her on mute while I comforted Alexis. After Alexis went to her room and started gaming, I looked over the texts from my sister. \n\nThey started fairly normal (is she ok? Will you guys be coming back?

Well happy birthday to you to OP cause clearly your sister thinks you were born yesterday.", "NTA\n\nYour sister may be right: it might not be grandma's fault if she didn't do it maliciously.  If she has dementia, your daughter's transition is likely to be something she needs to be reminded of, especially if the transition was announced to grandma after the dementia set in.  Her caretaker should have been supervising her while she was baking and at the same time gently reminding her of the name change.  It's so easy to do too.  \"Oh Alexis is going to love that cake.\"  \"Great choice on flavor, Alexis loves that flavor!\" \"Alexis is going to be so excited when she sees this!\" Seriously, if you repeat a name enough, you'll prime a person to use it; and even a person with full mental faculties might put it on the cake without thinking.  \n\nThis is your sister's fault.  She should have been reminding grandma to use the right name, and if grandma used the wrong name, your sister should have gently scraped it off and had grandma write the right name.  Or just leave it at \"Happy Birthday\". If grandma was having a bad day and that would have meant a fight/melt down, the *very least* your sister could have done was pull you/your daughter aside to discuss the situation before bringing the cake out.  \n\nInstead, your sister knowingly brought out a cake with your daughter's deadname on it.  Probably why she's going on the offensive now.  I would have a talk with your sister about how she handled this.  It should have been handled differently.", "NTA - your daughter is really lucky to have a supportive dad.", "NTA, and good on you for supporting your daughter. My only question is, was this intentional or was it the dementia? I'm not saying Alexis is wrong to be upset about it either way, but if your grandmother is suffering from dementia, this easily could've been an innocent mistake and if you have no reason to believe it was malicious it should be taken as such. Your sister is still out of line regardless, but depending on the circumstances, I hope grandma can be forgiven.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t lay blame on Grandma. Sister is on the hook for this one.", "INFO: I'm guessing in this instance grandma baked and decorated the cake. Did your sister, her caregiver, provide any assistance during this process and/or look at the cake before bringing it out?", "You didn't explain how severe grandmother's dementia is, at what stage it is, but I strongly doubt that a ninety-year-old with dementia was left completely alone, unsupervised, in the kitchen to bake the cake, in a potentially dangerous environment (oven, stove, knives).

I\u2019m very glad Alexis has a dad like you in her corner\u2014 you did a good job removing her from the situation and comforting her.\n\nI understand your grandma has dementia, and obviously that\u2019s not something she can help. And yes, it very likely was because of her dementia that she put Alexis\u2019 deadname on the cake (at least, one can hope). However, it was your sister, who DOESN\u2019T have dementia, who brought the cake out. She saw the deadname on the cake then, if not earlier, and it was a massive mistake on her part to not have your grandma correct or just entirely remove the name, or even do it herself. Your sister is the AH for not doing anything to avoid or mitigate the situation. And she is WAY the AH for insulting your daughter\u2014 ESPECIALLY calling her unstable.

Grandma may be old, but that's no excuse to disrespect her grandchild.  She doesn't have to agree with your daughter changing her name, but she better learn to accept it.", "NTA. Protecting your kid comes first.\n\nI do wonder though, was that intentional?

Ask her if she: a) Wants to talk about it with you. b) Wants you to listen to her vent her feelings. c) Wants to keep doing stuff to feel better. d) Wants some space e) Wants to talk to someone else (friend, therapist, etc...)\n3.

We are stepping away from placing people in one of two boxes, but the thing is, there have ALWAYS been those who don't fit in either box. A lot of boomers were raised with a binary ideology and are now realising that just like life experiences are not \"black and white\" in areas of right, wrong, harmful, beneficial...etc...gender and sexuality also come in many colors and flavors. \n\nIdentity cannot be summed up in one simple word, and gender and sexuality are on a spectrum like MOST other THINGS in life.

She may have been able to handle it with less shock had you talked about it prior and mentioned that grandma might have trouble with remembering that she has a different name now.\n\nRegardless you are never the AH for protecting your daughter and taking her out of a situation that really hurt her. \n\nI don't think grandma was an AH either, this is the tragedy that is dementia, it's so horrible.\n\nNAH (you, your daughter, or grandma) except for those failing to understand your actions to protect Alexis.", "NTA.

I am curious though--does the daughter know about her grandmother's condition? Does she know that Grandma might have lapses in her mental faculties?\n\nThe sister, while overly blunt and wrong for calling your daughter \"unstable\", is correct in that the grandma has a condition where her mental faculties are not 100. Sister was also trying to protect Grandma. \n\nTo me, it seems like a little bit of education and a whole lot of grace is needed in this situation.", "NAH only because grandma has dementia. Your daughter's pain is absolutely real and you were in an impossible situation.", "NTA.  My Child is NB and supporting the change is huge for mentally healthy kids.  It's been an adjustment to use their chosen name and we still slip up from time to time (it's only been a few months).\n\nI understand grandma probably baked and decorated the cake and with her age and dementia mistakes can be made.

Just smudge it and cover it with chocolate letter making up \"Alexis\".\n\nIf they didn't check the cake for whatever reasons, they should be quiet.\n\nThe equivalent of this situation is giving a cake with nuts to a person who is allergic to them due to not knowing/forgetting. Good intentions will not fix the harm, but they can be still appreciated in some cases.", "With dementia, names are often the first thing that goes. My grandmother called me by my mom's name, my aunt's, and my cousin's. I got cards with other people's names on them. I treasure those, because even if she didn't get my name right (and later didn't know who I was), she loved me and I loved her. It's reasonable that your daughter was upset, but it sounds like you need to have some conversations with her about what's going on with grandma and what to expect. I also understand aunt's frustration, because I'm guessing your grandmother was just as upset as your daughter and had no idea why you left. Talk to your daughter and make a plan for how she wants to handle things, because this will happen again (maybe not with a cake, but at least verbally), and it will not be your grandmother's fault. NAH, just a terrible situation.", "This sounds like it was a really tough situation. With grandma having dementia,  you might find that things like accidental use of Alexis' deadname increases,  she might remember you having a son rather than a daughter, and may fail to recognize Alexis (because she remembers your son), as the dementia progresses. With prompting grandma might correct herself,  or she might not. \n\nI think you should talk with Alexis about the possibility of this happening in the future, and make sure she is prepared that this could happen,  and how grandma doesn't mean it in a malicious way, it's just an unfortunate and sad part of the disease,  because it's not the way grandma would want to speak to Alexis if she had all her faculties. Talk to Alexis about how she wants to deal with this happening in the future.\n\nDementia is an awful disease that can completely change someone. Even if you're mad with your sister right now,  please check in on her and make sure she is supported. Being a live in support for someone with dementia is no mean feat.", "I'm sorry to go NTA for the sake of ease on this one, although there is a lot more nuance:\n\n\nAlexis did nothing wrong since she was rightfully upset.\n\n\nMaybe grandma does not completely suck since it might have been totally inadvertent with no ill will meant. However, she is still adult and can communicate with you knstead of the silent treatment. \n\n\nFor you: Yes, I think you are like 10% sucky here. You could have handled it better than storming out. I understand the need to defend your daughter, but it would have been better to have a didcussion with the family. I get leaving to comfor her, but the text back should have been: \"We will need to discuss this further at a better time.\" You will surley have more family get togethers so the best time to hash this out is now. \n\n\nYour sister is obviously the most suckey. I don't think it warrants any other explanation.\n\n\nMy final advice is to reiterate that you need to address this head on sooner than later. Good luck.", "So, grandma, in her 90s, is accepting of her grandchildren's identity. But mistakenly put the wrong name on the cake. A name, which grandma has been using to refer to this particular grandchild for more than 93% of the child's life. And we cried and stormed out? I wish I had a grandma bake me a cake. She could even put an intentionally insulting name on the cake.   \n\n\nThis, this is what grandma gets for trying to be generous and make a special cake for her grandchild's special day. It just isn't worth it.", "[deleted]", "How far is GM dementia? Yes sister could have objected when GM was making the cake but if GM was being difficult n was using the old name cus she forgets.

As a trans person, being deadnamed in such a big and public way hurts more than you think, especially coming from a family member. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was an accident, Alexis isn\u2019t to blame for her reaction, and OP isn\u2019t to blame for supporting her and getting her out of an emotionally volatile situation.

Nobody has to bend over backwards for you or anyone. Stop expecting people too. The sister could\u2019ve changed it but maybe she forgot like every other human being on the planet that can forget.

Your sis should still not be afraid to gently correct grandma, help fix the cake, or at the very least given you and Alexis a heads up first. On top of that calling Alexis unstable is incredibly rude on so many levels. Even if there wasn't the whole transphobic potential, seeing the wrong name can be hard for a teenager in that situation. A family member not being able to remember who you are because of dementia on its own is emotionally taxing. Even if you can be certain it wasn't malicious, it's a reminder that things aren't ok and won't be again. What you did was appropriate even if it was a case of grandma putting the name of her cousin instead for example. \n\nOn top of that, there is the natural rise of questions like \"Does grandma love me still? Would grandma and auntie be ok if I died? Am I not good enough? Do they think I'm a monster?\" Due to possibility of transphobia. She's human. She's allowed to have emotions. As a mature fully functioning adult, your sister should know that it's possible to offend someone without trying to. And when that happens you can't hold their emotions against them.
