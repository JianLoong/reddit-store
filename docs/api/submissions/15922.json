Well happy birthday to you to OP cause clearly your sister thinks you were born yesterday.", "NTA\n\nYour sister may be right: it might not be grandma's fault if she didn't do it maliciously.  If she has dementia, your daughter's transition is likely to be something she needs to be reminded of, especially if the transition was announced to grandma after the dementia set in.  Her caretaker should have been supervising her while she was baking and at the same time gently reminding her of the name change.  It's so easy to do too.  \"Oh Alexis is going to love that cake.\"  \"Great choice on flavor, Alexis loves that flavor!\" \"Alexis is going to be so excited when she sees this!\" Seriously, if you repeat a name enough, you'll prime a person to use it; and even a person with full mental faculties might put it on the cake without thinking.  \n\nThis is your sister's fault.  She should have been reminding grandma to use the right name, and if grandma used the wrong name, your sister should have gently scraped it off and had grandma write the right name.  Or just leave it at \"Happy Birthday\". If grandma was having a bad day and that would have meant a fight/melt down, the *very least* your sister could have done was pull you/your daughter aside to discuss the situation before bringing the cake out.  \n\nInstead, your sister knowingly brought out a cake with your daughter's deadname on it.  Probably why she's going on the offensive now.  I would have a talk with your sister about how she handled this.  It should have been handled differently.", "NTA - your daughter is really lucky to have a supportive dad.", "NTA, and good on you for supporting your daughter. My only question is, was this intentional or was it the dementia? I'm not saying Alexis is wrong to be upset about it either way, but if your grandmother is suffering from dementia, this easily could've been an innocent mistake and if you have no reason to believe it was malicious it should be taken as such. Your sister is still out of line regardless, but depending on the circumstances, I hope grandma can be forgiven.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t lay blame on Grandma. Sister is on the hook for this one.", "INFO: I'm guessing in this instance grandma baked and decorated the cake. Did your sister, her caregiver, provide any assistance during this process and/or look at the cake before bringing it out?", "You didn't explain how severe grandmother's dementia is, at what stage it is, but I strongly doubt that a ninety-year-old with dementia was left completely alone, unsupervised, in the kitchen to bake the cake, in a potentially dangerous environment (oven, stove, knives).

I\u2019m very glad Alexis has a dad like you in her corner\u2014 you did a good job removing her from the situation and comforting her.\n\nI understand your grandma has dementia, and obviously that\u2019s not something she can help. And yes, it very likely was because of her dementia that she put Alexis\u2019 deadname on the cake (at least, one can hope). However, it was your sister, who DOESN\u2019T have dementia, who brought the cake out. She saw the deadname on the cake then, if not earlier, and it was a massive mistake on her part to not have your grandma correct or just entirely remove the name, or even do it herself. Your sister is the AH for not doing anything to avoid or mitigate the situation. And she is WAY the AH for insulting your daughter\u2014 ESPECIALLY calling her unstable.

It\u2019s like they aren\u2019t taking her transition seriously.", "NTA. \n\nGrandma has mild dementia, but baked a cake wholly on her own? No help from anyone who could\u2019ve either gently pointed out the problem, or could\u2019ve done something about it themselves?\n\nYou can be damn sure if my grandma had dementia, I\u2019d be hovering over her at all times (to make sure she doesn\u2019t forget the cake in the oven, that she\u2019s doing everything right, isn\u2019t burning herself etc), and I would\u2019ve pointed it out or changed the name myself dependent on the severity of the dementia.

There's absolutely no reason she couldn't have used a knife to scrape off the name when before she brought it out.", "NTA.  You stood up for your daughter when she needed you.  Grandma may be old, but that's no excuse to disrespect her grandchild.  She doesn't have to agree with your daughter changing her name, but she better learn to accept it.", "NTA. Protecting your kid comes first.\n\nI do wonder though, was that intentional?

Ask her if she: a) Wants to talk about it with you. b) Wants you to listen to her vent her feelings. c) Wants to keep doing stuff to feel better. d) Wants some space e) Wants to talk to someone else (friend, therapist, etc...)\n3.

Sometimes we have to explain things to people who are not quite \"there\" yet when it comes to gender fluidity, and even autism spectrum disorder. We are stepping away from placing people in one of two boxes, but the thing is, there have ALWAYS been those who don't fit in either box. A lot of boomers were raised with a binary ideology and are now realising that just like life experiences are not \"black and white\" in areas of right, wrong, harmful, beneficial...etc...gender and sexuality also come in many colors and flavors. \n\nIdentity cannot be summed up in one simple word, and gender and sexuality are on a spectrum like MOST other THINGS in life.

She may have been able to handle it with less shock had you talked about it prior and mentioned that grandma might have trouble with remembering that she has a different name now.\n\nRegardless you are never the AH for protecting your daughter and taking her out of a situation that really hurt her. \n\nI don't think grandma was an AH either, this is the tragedy that is dementia, it's so horrible.\n\nNAH (you, your daughter, or grandma) except for those failing to understand your actions to protect Alexis.", "NTA.

Honestly even if you excuse the grandmother (which you should not) there must surely be someone else who was involved with the baking and icing of the cake.

I am curious though--does the daughter know about her grandmother's condition? Does she know that Grandma might have lapses in her mental faculties?\n\nThe sister, while overly blunt and wrong for calling your daughter \"unstable\", is correct in that the grandma has a condition where her mental faculties are not 100.

It's been an adjustment to use their chosen name and we still slip up from time to time (it's only been a few months).\n\nI understand grandma probably baked and decorated the cake and with her age and dementia mistakes can be made.

My grandmother called me by my mom's name, my aunt's, and my cousin's. I got cards with other people's names on them. I treasure those, because even if she didn't get my name right (and later didn't know who I was), she loved me and I loved her. It's reasonable that your daughter was upset, but it sounds like you need to have some conversations with her about what's going on with grandma and what to expect. I also understand aunt's frustration, because I'm guessing your grandmother was just as upset as your daughter and had no idea why you left. Talk to your daughter and make a plan for how she wants to handle things, because this will happen again (maybe not with a cake, but at least verbally), and it will not be your grandmother's fault. NAH, just a terrible situation.", "This sounds like it was a really tough situation. With grandma having dementia,  you might find that things like accidental use of Alexis' deadname increases,  she might remember you having a son rather than a daughter, and may fail to recognize Alexis (because she remembers your son), as the dementia progresses. With prompting grandma might correct herself,  or she might not. \n\nI think you should talk with Alexis about the possibility of this happening in the future, and make sure she is prepared that this could happen,  and how grandma doesn't mean it in a malicious way, it's just an unfortunate and sad part of the disease,  because it's not the way grandma would want to speak to Alexis if she had all her faculties. Talk to Alexis about how she wants to deal with this happening in the future.\n\nDementia is an awful disease that can completely change someone. Even if you're mad with your sister right now,  please check in on her and make sure she is supported. Being a live in support for someone with dementia is no mean feat.", "I'm sorry to go NTA for the sake of ease on this one, although there is a lot more nuance:\n\n\nAlexis did nothing wrong since she was rightfully upset.\n\n\nMaybe grandma does not completely suck since it might have been totally inadvertent with no ill will meant. However, she is still adult and can communicate with you knstead of the silent treatment. \n\n\nFor you: Yes, I think you are like 10% sucky here. You could have handled it better than storming out. I understand the need to defend your daughter, but it would have been better to have a didcussion with the family. I get leaving to comfor her, but the text back should have been: \"We will need to discuss this further at a better time.\" You will surley have more family get togethers so the best time to hash this out is now. \n\n\nYour sister is obviously the most suckey. I don't think it warrants any other explanation.\n\n\nMy final advice is to reiterate that you need to address this head on sooner than later. Good luck.", "So, grandma, in her 90s, is accepting of her grandchildren's identity. But mistakenly put the wrong name on the cake. A name, which grandma has been using to refer to this particular grandchild for more than 93% of the child's life. And we cried and stormed out? I wish I had a grandma bake me a cake. She could even put an intentionally insulting name on the cake.   \n\n\nThis, this is what grandma gets for trying to be generous and make a special cake for her grandchild's special day. It just isn't worth it.", "[deleted]", "How far is GM dementia? Yes sister could have objected when GM was making the cake but if GM was being difficult n was using the old name cus she forgets.

Even then, the sister should\u2019ve caught it, and at the very least warned Alexis about the cake *before* it came out. \n\nThis take reeks of transphobia. The fact that you put daughter in quotes is telling.", "Not a big deal? Either you\u2019ve never met a trans person in your life, or you\u2019re just transphobic. Either way, you\u2019re wrong. Obviously the grandma isn\u2019t in the wrong, duh, but the sister absolutely is. Even if she (for some reason) couldn\u2019t fix the cake, at the very least, she could\u2019ve warned OP and his daughter. The fact that she didn\u2019t even bother to do that, and then blamed Alexis for having an emotional reaction, says a lot about how much she respects Alexis (hint: it\u2019s not much). As a trans person, being deadnamed in such a big and public way hurts more than you think, especially coming from a family member. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was an accident, Alexis isn\u2019t to blame for her reaction, and OP isn\u2019t to blame for supporting her and getting her out of an emotionally volatile situation. I sincerely hope that you never become a parent to a queer kid, because they\u2019re in for a rough time.", "This!", "Memory loss from dementia starts with the most recent memories and goes backward in time. Since OP stated that Alexis came out two years ago, it's highly likely that the dementia is indeed impacting her memory regarding Alexis's transition.\n\nMy own grandmother (early stages) was diagnosed this year, and she's already forgetting that my cousin is studying in Germany as of last year. I'm more worried about how my dad and his siblings will react if she fails to recognize her own children or even starts to look for her late husband.", "Not that it\u2019s any of your business, but we actually have talked to a psychologist and she agreed that Alexis transitioning would be the best thing for her mental health. I\u2019m willing to accept if I\u2019m TA, but I won\u2019t accept transphobia towards my daughter. Fuck off.", "Seems like you're the only other asshole here aside from his sister.", "You\u2019re right, but only because the \u2018real world\u2019 hates her for being herself. It\u2019s not her fault that the world is a cruel place for people like her.", "I have a history of fucking up writing on cakes -- my brain and hands get misaligned and I'll miss a letter or something. It's super easy to fix without anyone being the wiser, especially if you notice pretty quickly.\n\n(Sometimes you miss it and then the cake says \"Happy Bi ^r thday, Kid,\" and your ex-husband jokes about it every year for the next decade.)", "Or just write \"Happy birthday\". there is no need to even include a name.  Everyone knows who they are there for", "Also, the shakes are real at that age. No way I blame grandma", "My auntie is in the early stages and still bakes.  She bakes pies and still does.  I could see her doing this out of habit.  Auntie could have corrected this issue but didn't care enough to.  I always go into the kitchen after my auntie is done to make sure everything has been turned off.  I'm sure Auntie does this as well, and I knew what was on that cake.", "My great grandmother could still make pies as good as in her prime well after her memory was severely impacted.  My mom would do the actual baking but great grandma would do everything else.  It was all muscle memory for her.", "You still watch them, though. My grandma went from absolutely fine in the kitchen to putting a Tupperware in the oven to cook stuffed grape leaves literally overnight. A dish she\u2019d been making regularly for 60 years, that isn\u2019t even cooked in the oven.", "Yup! The kind of comment I'd give my one free award to in the 3 days until the next one! Damn you reddit for taking them away :(", "Agreed. OP didn\u2019t quote it, so the sister might not have said it. But if she did say it or the general attitude of the convo was like that then yeah it\u2019s a dick move.", "That stood out to me as well", "Decorating on her own maybe, that's a safe low risk activity they'd be encouraged to try honestly. Still a shitty sister though.\n Like I could believe decorated and added name on her own, but any caring aunt would have gone 'ooops okay Grandma no that's not the name X uses anymore, let's put the name they like okay? We can fix that'", "Or karma.", "You don't just stop existing before the day you come out as trans.", "Cause you can totally make an assessment for the dementia of someone from some third party post, lmao", "as OP stated, yes", "So you would choose to smooth things over rather than support your kid; that\u2019s sad. I hope you don\u2019t parent a queer kid.", "I seriously hope you don\u2019t talk to anyone in your life because assuming something about someone you know nothing about tells me a lot about you. It\u2019s not a big deal being called the wrong name. You forgot one important thing. They are human and humans make mistake. Wtf you want them to be, robots to do every trans persons bidding gtfoh. Nobody has to bend over backwards for you or anyone. Stop expecting people too. The sister could\u2019ve changed it but maybe she forgot like every other human being on the planet that can forget. Maybe she was too excited for the situation and forgot. There\u2019s multiple factors. Also don\u2019t call someone something you have absolutely no idea of the meaning. Cuz one I ain\u2019t scared of nobody nor am I ever saying that that person is ever what they were before I\u2019ve been very respectful of HER pronouns.", "Also fyi I\u2019ve met amazing trans folk in my life. Don\u2019t fucking assume anything about anyone ever again", "Ah. I see. And has Great Grandma ever expressed any hateful sentiments towards your daughter? If not, then this is even more of a NAH in my book. If I were you, I would just reiterate the condition to your daughter and that Great Grandma didn't mean any harm. As I stated earlier, a little grace and understanding can go a long way.", "> but I won\u2019t accept transphobia towards my daughter.\n\nNeither will we. If you see any more please report and we'll ban. Best part of modding getting to ban the bigots.", "I highly disagree with that. I think trans and lgbtq have just about every major company as supporters.", "That last bit seems oddly specific, as if there's a backstory", "Honestly, the only reason my grandpa stopped making his famous apple pie is because of his neuropathy, not his dementia. He couldn\u2019t stand long enough to be able to make it.", "The sister definitely saw it and left it on purpose. If it was an accident sister would be mortified not doubling down on and trying to blame OP\u2019s daughter", "Yeah. Even if grandma did the cake alone (which I can believe if she done it all her life, I've heard of similar stories) you can't tell me that during a big birthday event no one else went in and out the kitchen to grab whatever stuff while grandma was doing the cake. You can't tell me that during a large gathering no one else got to see the finished cake before it was brought to the table.\n\nThere's just no way.", "> \"That's certainly possible but hard to know without more info.\"\n\nNo, it's pretty crystal clear from what evidence has been presented. Calling her unstable for being upset about an intentional deadnaming (even if grandma was innocently insensitive due to dementia, sister has no excuse for not catching and correcting it) and insisting she should've just gone along with it because \"grandma's old\" is incredibly blatant emotional manipulation.", "No, but the person you were does. What point are you trying to make here?", "As I said, even if the grandma didn\u2019t do it on purpose and actually forgot (which would absolve her of any blame) the sister is 100% at fault for not correcting the cake or at the very least warning OP and his daughter about the cake. You just think her feelings don\u2019t matter because she\u2019s trans.", "OP says the sister was the one who carried the cake out. The sister saw the cake knew the cake had the deadname on it and chose to do nothing, rather than just gently remind her grandmother that the birthday girl's name was Alexis.\n\nOP said that Alexis has been out for two years, and in a comment he said that she has spent time with her great-grandmother after she came out. The grandmother may have genuinely forgotten, but the sister has no excuse.", "I didn't say that. I just said that not everything needs to be a battle. Pick and choose your fights. Was Dad right in supporting their daughter? Absolutely. But the hate towards a dementia patient? Unwarranted.", "She\u2019s never been explicitly hateful, but she has a hard time understanding that the kid she\u2019s always known as her great-grandson is actually her great-granddaughter. Alexis has told me on multiple occasions that spending time with her is tiring because she feels like she has to justify her existence over and over again.", "Or even \u201cHey can you all keep grandma occupied in the living room for a few minutes? I need to make some adjustments to the cake.\u201d", "Yeah op I think you\u2019re a little naive on this one. Your sister immediately degenerated to your daughter having mental issues and being \u201cunstable\u201d which is a fairly trans phobic viewpoint I\u2019ve been told. Its the thought process that implies trans people naturally are not in a fit state of mind. She texted this as soon as she realized she wasn\u2019t going to get the fight from you she wanted because you didn\u2019t immediately respond to her. This is a drama queen who used your daughter for her own personal drama reasons. Has she done things like this before to other people for other reasons? \n\nShe \ud83d\udcaf saw the name on that cake and let it come out anyways\n\nNTA", "That's cool. Your sis should still not be afraid to gently correct grandma, help fix the cake, or at the very least given you and Alexis a heads up first. On top of that calling Alexis unstable is incredibly rude on so many levels. Even if there wasn't the whole transphobic potential, seeing the wrong name can be hard for a teenager in that situation. A family member not being able to remember who you are because of dementia on its own is emotionally taxing. Even if you can be certain it wasn't malicious, it's a reminder that things aren't ok and won't be again. What you did was appropriate even if it was a case of grandma putting the name of her cousin instead for example. \n\nOn top of that, there is the natural rise of questions like \"Does grandma love me still? Would grandma and auntie be ok if I died? Am I not good enough? Do they think I'm a monster?\" Due to possibility of transphobia. She's human. She's allowed to have emotions. As a mature fully functioning adult, your sister should know that it's possible to offend someone without trying to. And when that happens you can't hold their emotions against them. If it was a genuine mistake they would be mature enough to take responsibility. Not shift blame to a child's reasonable response of sadness.", "You\u2019re right and I said the same thing to someone else about it. But she also could\u2019ve forgotten too. People forget sometimes in exciting situations ya know", "What hate towards a dementia patient? \n\nAnd what does not everything needs to be a battle even mean here? It seems like you\u2019re implying he should have \u201clet this one go\u201d, which I think is abysmal parenting.", "Okay. I think I understand and I fully sympathize with your daughter. Sometimes explaining certain concepts to older generations can be tiresome because, honestly, they just don't get it. Add to that the dementia and that could make for some awkward issues.", "[removed]", "Good on you though for doing the right thing and leaving immediately and letting her decompress with your support", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
