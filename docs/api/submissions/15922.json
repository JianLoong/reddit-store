Your sister wants you to believe that this was wholly the doing of the 90 year old with dementia? As cartaker of a 90 year old with dementia, she felt solo-baking was cool? Well happy birthday to you to OP cause clearly your sister thinks you were born yesterday.", "NTA\n\nYour sister may be right: it might not be grandma's fault if she didn't do it maliciously.  If she has dementia, your daughter's transition is likely to be something she needs to be reminded of, especially if the transition was announced to grandma after the dementia set in.  Her caretaker should have been supervising her while she was baking and at the same time gently reminding her of the name change.  It's so easy to do too.  \"Oh Alexis is going to love that cake.\"  \"Great choice on flavor, Alexis loves that flavor!\" \"Alexis is going to be so excited when she sees this!\" Seriously, if you repeat a name enough, you'll prime a person to use it; and even a person with full mental faculties might put it on the cake without thinking.  \n\nThis is your sister's fault.  She should have been reminding grandma to use the right name, and if grandma used the wrong name, your sister should have gently scraped it off and had grandma write the right name.  Or just leave it at \"Happy Birthday\". If grandma was having a bad day and that would have meant a fight/melt down, the *very least* your sister could have done was pull you/your daughter aside to discuss the situation before bringing the cake out.  \n\nInstead, your sister knowingly brought out a cake with your daughter's deadname on it.  Probably why she's going on the offensive now.  I would have a talk with your sister about how she handled this.  It should have been handled differently.", "NTA - your daughter is really lucky to have a supportive dad.", "NTA, and good on you for supporting your daughter. My only question is, was this intentional or was it the dementia? I'm not saying Alexis is wrong to be upset about it either way, but if your grandmother is suffering from dementia, this easily could've been an innocent mistake and if you have no reason to believe it was malicious it should be taken as such. Your sister is still out of line regardless, but depending on the circumstances, I hope grandma can be forgiven.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t lay blame on Grandma. Sister is on the hook for this one.", "INFO: I'm guessing in this instance grandma baked and decorated the cake. Did your sister, her caregiver, provide any assistance during this process and/or look at the cake before bringing it out?", "You didn't explain how severe grandmother's dementia is, at what stage it is, but I strongly doubt that a ninety-year-old with dementia was left completely alone, unsupervised, in the kitchen to bake the cake, in a potentially dangerous environment (oven, stove, knives). Someone should have been by her side (a caregiver). This someone could correct the icing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I\u2019m very glad Alexis has a dad like you in her corner\u2014 you did a good job removing her from the situation and comforting her.\n\nI understand your grandma has dementia, and obviously that\u2019s not something she can help. And yes, it very likely was because of her dementia that she put Alexis\u2019 deadname on the cake (at least, one can hope). However, it was your sister, who DOESN\u2019T have dementia, who brought the cake out. She saw the deadname on the cake then, if not earlier, and it was a massive mistake on her part to not have your grandma correct or just entirely remove the name, or even do it herself. Your sister is the AH for not doing anything to avoid or mitigate the situation. And she is WAY the AH for insulting your daughter\u2014 ESPECIALLY calling her unstable. You were right for calling that out as an incredibly unkind thing to say about her niece.", "I think you need to have a discussion with the grandmother to see where her mind is", "INFO:\n\nDoes your grandmother have Alzheimer\u2019s or Dementia?", "Nta, you are an awesome parent!!

It\u2019s like they aren\u2019t taking her transition seriously.", "NTA. \n\nGrandma has mild dementia, but baked a cake wholly on her own? No help from anyone who could\u2019ve either gently pointed out the problem, or could\u2019ve done something about it themselves?\n\nYou can be damn sure if my grandma had dementia, I\u2019d be hovering over her at all times (to make sure she doesn\u2019t forget the cake in the oven, that she\u2019s doing everything right, isn\u2019t burning herself etc), and I would\u2019ve pointed it out or changed the name myself dependent on the severity of the dementia. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d let anyone get deadnamed, whether grandma had issues or not.", "NTA. Goddamn I wish I had a single parent even HALF as supportive as you are.

Your sister absolutely knew the name was wrong and didn't do anything about it.  There's absolutely no reason she couldn't have used a knife to scrape off the name when before she brought it out.", "NTA.  You stood up for your daughter when she needed you.  Grandma may be old, but that's no excuse to disrespect her grandchild.  She doesn't have to agree with your daughter changing her name, but she better learn to accept it.", "NTA. Protecting your kid comes first.\n\nI do wonder though, was that intentional? Was it a \u201cgrandma is old and can\u2019t adjust to having a trans grandchild,\u201d or a \u201cgrandma has dementia and literally does not remember that her grandchild is trans?\u201d Either way, you made the right move to protect your child, but obviously one is worse than the other", "NTA\n\nI applaud you.

Ask her if she: a) Wants to talk about it with you. b) Wants you to listen to her vent her feelings. c) Wants to keep doing stuff to feel better. d) Wants some space e) Wants to talk to someone else (friend, therapist, etc...)\n3.

Sometimes we have to explain things to people who are not quite \"there\" yet when it comes to gender fluidity, and even autism spectrum disorder. We are stepping away from placing people in one of two boxes, but the thing is, there have ALWAYS been those who don't fit in either box. A lot of boomers were raised with a binary ideology and are now realising that just like life experiences are not \"black and white\" in areas of right, wrong, harmful, beneficial...etc...gender and sexuality also come in many colors and flavors. \n\nIdentity cannot be summed up in one simple word, and gender and sexuality are on a spectrum like MOST other THINGS in life.

She may have been able to handle it with less shock had you talked about it prior and mentioned that grandma might have trouble with remembering that she has a different name now.\n\nRegardless you are never the AH for protecting your daughter and taking her out of a situation that really hurt her. \n\nI don't think grandma was an AH either, this is the tragedy that is dementia, it's so horrible.\n\nNAH (you, your daughter, or grandma) except for those failing to understand your actions to protect Alexis.", "NTA.

Honestly even if you excuse the grandmother (which you should not) there must surely be someone else who was involved with the baking and icing of the cake. By you setting up strict boundaries with your family about how your daughter will not be disrespected you set up a precedent for how future interactions(if any) should be carried out with her. You make a pretty damn well father op and I am sure in this way you are teaching your daughter to not take any disrespect from anyone and to stand up and distance herself from problematic people.", "NTA. It sounds like your family was doing this deliberately, and that's the asshole move, here.", "NAH and I know I might catch flack for this, but hear me out: \n\nIt was good of the dad to help provide a safe space for his daughter and get her out of a situation that was particularly uncomfortable. I am curious though--does the daughter know about her grandmother's condition? Does she know that Grandma might have lapses in her mental faculties?\n\nThe sister, while overly blunt and wrong for calling your daughter \"unstable\", is correct in that the grandma has a condition where her mental faculties are not 100. Sister was also trying to protect Grandma. \n\nTo me, it seems like a little bit of education and a whole lot of grace is needed in this situation.", "NAH only because grandma has dementia.

It's been an adjustment to use their chosen name and we still slip up from time to time (it's only been a few months).\n\nI understand grandma probably baked and decorated the cake and with her age and dementia mistakes can be made.

If grandma couldn't comprehend the request then no name would have been better.", "NTA for you and grandma. Others are TA\n\nYour sister could try to fix the cake or anybody else who was helping/watching over that poor lady. Just smudge it and cover it with chocolate letter making up \"Alexis\".\n\nIf they didn't check the cake for whatever reasons, they should be quiet.\n\nThe equivalent of this situation is giving a cake with nuts to a person who is allergic to them due to not knowing/forgetting. Good intentions will not fix the harm, but they can be still appreciated in some cases.", "With dementia, names are often the first thing that goes. My grandmother called me by my mom's name, my aunt's, and my cousin's. I got cards with other people's names on them. I treasure those, because even if she didn't get my name right (and later didn't know who I was), she loved me and I loved her. It's reasonable that your daughter was upset, but it sounds like you need to have some conversations with her about what's going on with grandma and what to expect. I also understand aunt's frustration, because I'm guessing your grandmother was just as upset as your daughter and had no idea why you left. Talk to your daughter and make a plan for how she wants to handle things, because this will happen again (maybe not with a cake, but at least verbally), and it will not be your grandmother's fault. NAH, just a terrible situation.", "This sounds like it was a really tough situation. With grandma having dementia,  you might find that things like accidental use of Alexis' deadname increases,  she might remember you having a son rather than a daughter, and may fail to recognize Alexis (because she remembers your son), as the dementia progresses. With prompting grandma might correct herself,  or she might not. \n\nI think you should talk with Alexis about the possibility of this happening in the future, and make sure she is prepared that this could happen,  and how grandma doesn't mean it in a malicious way, it's just an unfortunate and sad part of the disease,  because it's not the way grandma would want to speak to Alexis if she had all her faculties. Talk to Alexis about how she wants to deal with this happening in the future.\n\nDementia is an awful disease that can completely change someone. Even if you're mad with your sister right now,  please check in on her and make sure she is supported. Being a live in support for someone with dementia is no mean feat.", "I'm sorry to go NTA for the sake of ease on this one, although there is a lot more nuance:\n\n\nAlexis did nothing wrong since she was rightfully upset.\n\n\nMaybe grandma does not completely suck since it might have been totally inadvertent with no ill will meant. However, she is still adult and can communicate with you knstead of the silent treatment. \n\n\nFor you: Yes, I think you are like 10% sucky here. You could have handled it better than storming out. I understand the need to defend your daughter, but it would have been better to have a didcussion with the family. I get leaving to comfor her, but the text back should have been: \"We will need to discuss this further at a better time.\" You will surley have more family get togethers so the best time to hash this out is now. \n\n\nYour sister is obviously the most suckey. I don't think it warrants any other explanation.\n\n\nMy final advice is to reiterate that you need to address this head on sooner than later. Good luck.", "So, grandma, in her 90s, is accepting of her grandchildren's identity. But mistakenly put the wrong name on the cake. A name, which grandma has been using to refer to this particular grandchild for more than 93% of the child's life. And we cried and stormed out? I wish I had a grandma bake me a cake. She could even put an intentionally insulting name on the cake.   \n\n\nThis, this is what grandma gets for trying to be generous and make a special cake for her grandchild's special day. It just isn't worth it.", "I\u2019m sorry to say but yes YTA you stated she has dementia. Unless you have a cure for that then that was pretty ungrateful and unstable. I get that ya know she transitioned and I\u2019m happy for her. But at the same time you have to expect that grandma didn\u2019t do anything wrong because you stated she had mild dementia. I would\u2019ve put on a smile and had the cake and spend it with family. I assume other people know she transitioned and others have her the respect she deserved so it\u2019s not that big of a deal especially coming from someone who\u2019s in her 90s", "How far is GM dementia? Yes sister could have objected when GM was making the cake but if GM was being difficult n was using the old name cus she forgets. That is one thing if she was refusing to use the preferred name cus she is transphobic is another.\n\nDepending on the answers from slight YTA for the first part to NTA is GM is being transphobic.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My sister definitely helped during the actual baking process, but I\u2019m not sure if she helped decorate or checked the cake before bringing it out.", "I think dementia is an umbrella term and Alzheimer\u2019s is a specific form of it", "She has mild memory and recognition problems that the doctors say are a result of her old age, but they\u2019ve not diagnosed her with a specific disorder like Alzheimer\u2019s.", "> If it were anyone else but her 90 year old grandma with dementia, I'd say you were not the AH without a moment's hesitation... but honestly I think it could have been readily predicted that grandma may simply not remember, not through lack of love but because of her dementia.\n\nI had the same thought at first, but honestly OP\u2019s sister should have caught it - the fact that she didn\u2019t, and then ATTACKED OP\u2019s daughter for being upset makes her a major AH in my book\u2026 It even makes me wonder if she either did it intentionally, or best-case scenario, declined to correct the cake for fear of upsetting grandma.\n\nOP, you are NTA, and handled the situation with remarkable calm. Having said that, if your sister and grandma *somehow* don\u2019t realize what they\u2019ve done wrong, they should be made aware.", "Sister could have smeared out the writing since she knew it was incorrect... just marble it into the other frosting. \n\nOP: NTA", "I was thinking the same thing.  It would have been 'okay' if OP would have talked to his daughter about being gracious.  Even if Grandma didn't have dementia, it would still be a challenging concept to understand at that age (I'd think).  Everyone loves and is accepting of OPs daughter, all of these changes are challenging.", "She knows that her great-grandma has issues remembering things, I think she was more shocked and hurt than angry with my grandma specifically.", "Disagree. No quarter for bigots. They can get on board or lose access to the child. Tolerating this ignorance and hate has led us to the crisis we are in today.", "Except that his sister lives with her and is her caregiver and even with mild dementia, she would probably need some assistance meaning the sister should have been aware of what was being written. Meaning she could have changed it or stopped it. Also, if the sister carried out the cake, she should have noticed it right away just chose not to say something, for some reason.", "Are we honestly saying a 90 year old grandma with dementia made that cake alone?", "The grandma with dementia has an adult carer that should have been MORE than capable of making sure the correct name was on the cake. He should not have forced his daughter to have her identity be so disrespected.", "Wow. \ud83d\udc4e", "Except sister is with her right?", "There is 0% chance grandma made the cake without sister's help.  Sister let this happen.", "I agree with this. Sometimes a little grace and patience can go a long way. Not EVERYTHING needs to be a fight or a battle or a soap box \"I'm more enlightened than you are\" moment. Just exercise a bit of grace and keep it pushing.", "My grandma only had mild memory and recognition problems, but is otherwise very competent and independent", "Hell, drop a spatula ton the name and \u201csmear\u201d it on the way up at the very least!", "> and even in her old age, she still bakes and decorates cakes all on her own\n\naccording to op she does", "Sister is definitely out of line for how she handled this afterwards, and probably TA to begin with. I can see a scenario where she didn't check the cake before she brought it out, but it's not an incredibly likely one.", "Honestly, regardless you\u2019re NTA. You were protecting your daughter and that\u2019s what matters most.", "Thank you", "That's certainly possible but hard to know without more info. But yes certainly possible. Not having any insight into that is why I've gone nah on the main characters (Alexis, OP, Grandma), though not the others such as OPs sister.", "That I get and totally understand the sister could be at fault but I\u2019m only stating that the blame shouldn\u2019t be on the grandmother. I have respect for the elderly so for me I wanna make sure that the grandma didn\u2019t get any shit for it. Especially seeing other comments regarding her health saying it could be an issue.", "She could have if its something she's been doing her whole life.  People with dementia generally do well in settings that they are used to, eg the kitchen of their own home, doing the same things they always have.  Procedural memory is different to remembering things like names. This is why if you people with dementia to allow access to musical instruments they can still play amazing music,  but might not be able to recognize their own children.", "Idk I mean they didn\u2019t say if they mentioned ya know the situation to them so again idk", "I mean you\u2019d be surprised what seniors can accomplish but if this was the case yes I agree", "\"So beautiful...I think you misspelled the name lets just remove it, look at the time HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALEXIS\" \n\nIts not hard to support.", "She\u2019s been baking all her life, so except for some help getting things in and out of the oven, reaching things in high places, etc, she does do everything herself.", "That's not really the issue at hand though. It's that OP walked out with his daughter. I guess I fail to understand how wanting to protect his child makes him an AH. He's not necessarily saying he blames grandma, just that he's getting shit for leaving.", "That much makes sense, but whether or not your sister actually works alongside her through the whole process, this is a very predictable outcome of having someone with dementia decorate a cake for a recently out trans kid.\n\nSo ask yourself what's more likely \u2014 that this didn't occur to your sister, that she never had a chance to see or correct the cake before it was brought out, that this is a genuine accident? Or that your sister has been waiting for an opportunity to denigrate your daughter?", "It is the issue at hand cuz he walked out on everyone there. He could\u2019ve handled the situation better by pulling them aside and seeing if they could scribble out the name and put her real name. It\u2019s honestly a simple mistake. It could slip up on anyone.", "Obviously the grandma and sister feel some type of way because they wanted it to be special and obviously they could\u2019ve something beforehand about her name to not get confused ya know. Maybe that didn\u2019t happen", "And everyone else besides the sister is on his side. She has seen it and already starting crying. Removing the name would not have made it any better. Pulling them aside in that moment would not have made it better.", "Not with his daughter so upset.  He did the right thing by leaving and focusing on her.", "Right but I think that\u2019s an overreaction tho I\u2019m sorry to say that. You can\u2019t expect everyone to already get adjusted if they didn\u2019t talk about it previously. It wasn\u2019t stated they did. How we\u2019re they supposed to know if they weren\u2019t informed ya know.", "OP states that she transitioned 2 years ago, so this isn't exactly a new things, so I think it's safe to say they were informed. I mean, was OP just supposed to let his daughter sit there and cry and feel sad on her birthday? That would have been mean and not good parenting.", "No I\u2019m not saying that. But I\u2019m saying it takes longer for people to try and adjust especially knowing them for a long time. Sometimes it slips out. It\u2019s human nature. If he said they didn\u2019t try and apologize or contact them that\u2019s that\u2019s understandable I get that. But she did and asked if she was okay and whatnot. I would say the dad should\u2019ve also prepped and help make everything perfect ya know. Should\u2019ve told the sister to get the name right make sure nobody disrespects her. Again I\u2019m not saying that what happened wasn\u2019t disrespectful but I\u2019m saying it was an over reaction and could\u2019ve been handled much differently. You can\u2019t expect everyone to adjust the same it takes longer especially for others", "It's been two years, and this was not a verbal slip. Someone -- either the 90-year-old with dementia or the adult caregiver who is well aware of OP's daughter's name -- had to write the deadname on the cake. And at some point the caregiver had to have seen the cake before bringing it out, and it never occurred to her to take five seconds in the kitchen and scrape off the dead name so it just said \"happy birthday!\" The caregiver had the chance to do the right thing and chose instead to leave the deadname. \n\nThe grandma is not the AH, but this isn't \"who is the asshole?\" It's \"am *I* the asshole,\" and OP is not.", "> I would say the dad should\u2019ve also prepped and help make everything perfect ya know. Should\u2019ve told the sister to get the name right make sure nobody disrespects her.\n\nWhy is that the dads job when people are aware? That sounds like something others need to work on, not OP. And he did make sure no one disrespects her...by leaving. What you're saying is that we should just automatically forgive people when they hurt us and that's not right. This isn't like they got the wrong flavor, it's her name, her identity."]}
