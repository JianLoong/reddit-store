I generally talk to my kid daily and the grands like once a week at least.

It seems like you're really doing your best for you and your family and that's very admirable, especially considering the way you're feeling.\n\nI know it's unlikely your wife would agree based on your concerns, but couple's counseling could be a great way for you to go. On the more viable side of things, do you have anyone you could talk to about this? Like a therapist, a family member, or a close friend? Being able to speak openly about how you feel could really help, especially seeing as your wife appears to shut you down from expressing your emotions.\n\nI can't offer much, but I hope things improve.

That\u2019s something counseling can help work through. It can also give you tools and structure for more productive conversations.
