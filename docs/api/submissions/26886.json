I offered to buy her homecoming dress because my wife makes much less money than I do. My wife said that was a nice gesture. I'm buying it because I wanted her to have something nice to wear, and I quoted her to be happy. Then today I learn this boy is coming over to watch a movie Friday night. Once again not a big deal. My wife, daughter and I were talking about it tonight. My wife mentions our youngest stepdaughter will be watching too. I said that's good, but I think our oldest daughter should also have some time with just her and this boy. As I'm sure it would be awkward for both the boy and our oldest daughter to have a 10 year old around the whole time. After saying this my wife tells me I need to stay in my lane and storms off. I have been with her for 4 years and married to her for two. Neither steps daughters bio is in the picture. So I had assumed I was taking on more of a father role. When she said this and stormed off it really hurt my feelings. Like I'm good enough to buy things for the girls and pay all our bills. But apparently not good enough to give an opinion on something so small.

This also allows them to watch whatever they want without worrying about it not being too PG for a 10 year old.\n\nI will say, separate from this specific issue, it seems like there's deeper problems going on here. Most of the post appears perfectly normal until the end when you say:\n\n>\"my wife tells me I need to stay in my lane and storms off... it really hurt my feelings.

Like this is a regular thing where you feel like you're just a wallet and you can't give your opinions on minor things. I might be extrapolating here or reading too much into things, and I apologize if I am, but I feel like this is actually the core issue. Maybe you should try contemplating this possibility or addressing your feelings on this with her.", "NTA - You & your wife need to talk about parenting issues when your stepdaughters are not around. Discuss her boundaries & yours. Write down the issues that are important to you prior to your discussion so that the conversation says calm & focused. \n\nBlended families are tough. But it appears you deeply care about the girls and want to be a part of their lives. Just work out the details with your wife so you no longer are an ATM and she is comfortable. Good luck!", "Not the asshole. You definitely have Justification for feeling the way that you do.", "NTA.  You have some choices to make going forward.  One of them is marriage counseling.", "NTA- inform her that yes you will stay in your lane however that lane no longer includes covering expenses for her children that you can\u2019t parent\u2026", "NTA and your feelings are yours and valid. She needs to get her act together or you need to rethink the relationship.", "NTA, and I am gonna be honest.  I think your wife sees you more as an ATM than as a partner.\n\n1) She is content to let you pay for the kids  \n\n2) By your own words she has two children by two different men who both abandoned them.  \n\n3) By your comments she dismisses your feelings and gaslights your objections\n\n4) By your comments she has no interest in improving the relationship beyond criticizing you.\n\nI hate to be the one to tell you this, but your relationship is toxic and to find happiness you will probably have to divorce.", "NTA. Tell her exactly what you said here. If you are enough of a father figure that your lane has you contributing financially, you are enough of a father figure to have a simple opinion.", "Esh - buying her a dress shouldn't come with strings. You don't \"earn\" a parental role by buying things and paying bills. \nI would definitely not repeat that trash logic to your wife unless you particularly enjoy sleeping on the couch.\n\nIs it possible your wife read something a little more into \"we should let them be alone together\" than you intended? Because deciding whether two teens  can bone in your house some advanced level parenting and you've been a step dad for like... 5 minutes.\n\nSlow your roll, respect the boundaries, and do nice things without assuming it entitles you to to a certain kind of relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am sorry and am a firm believer in found family.  Hell I claimed a kid and grandkids in a different country that my ex-wife fostered.  I generally talk to my kid daily and the grands like once a week at least.  Doesn\u2019t matter that she isn\u2019t blood, doesn\u2019t matter that she has bio family, it matters that I show up for her over and over again regardless of what my relationship is with my ex.  \nGood luck, if couples counseling (and the rules that are required in it) aren\u2019t an option get a therapist for you so you can work out what you want and what you want to do about what is happening.", "NAH. you were trying to do a nice thing by your step daughter, thats obvious. id take this opportunity to discuss parenting boundaries with her mother, who may know something you dont. she could be purposefully having the younger sister in the room as a buffer, or maybe her daughter came to her saying she was nervous and wanted her sister there as support. trust her lead. \n\nwhile your wife may have overreacted to your very well intended proposition,  perhaps this was a conversation to be had privately between you two.", "There's no point in talking to her about this as it will just be turned into me being unreasonable or one of the several other things she always. I just feel tired and broken at this point. I've been trying so hard to make this work.", "Honestly I don't even want to do that. It would just be us in a room with someone while she yalks down to me and that's just embarrassment that I don't want.", "I wish I could do that, but I don't have it in me to take anything away from the girls", "Ik that bit I worry for the kids", "I did, I've been kicked out of the bedroom. She's locked the door, I can't even get clothes for work. I just wish I had somewhere else I could fo for awhile. I feel like this is going to get much worse for me. I shouldn't have even said anything.", "So did you just not read the post? Or are you that stupid?", "You clearly lack reading comprehension. I've been in thes girls lives for 4 years. We have all I've together for over 3. The dress had no strings attached what so ever. Am I not allowed to want my step daughter to be happy. As far as the sex thing goes your implying, it was already set that they would be in the living room. There is zero chance anything like that would happen.", "The daughter was the one saying she didn't want the little sister there the whole time. I was just saying her daughter should get to have her time too. I think the main root of the issue is the youngest daughter gets treated much differently than the oldest.the youngest clearly gets favorable outcomes from her mother. I think she seen it as me attacking the youngest when really I just want our oldest to be treated how anyone would  want to be. At least this is what I'm trying to convince myself of her reaction.", "\"Tired and broken\" is not good man ... sounds like your wife won't appreciate what she's got until it's gone. Tell her you need to take some time away to figure out if you're staying in this marriage or not, then go stay with a friend or rent an Airbnb. And really think about if you want to live with a person who makes you feel broken and tired.", "I'm really sorry, this seems like a tough situation to be in. It feels like there's a lot of internal problems going on here. Hopefully, the validation from these comments that you are absolutely not in the wrong will make you feel better, but there are clearly some intense issues with this relationship. It seems like you're really doing your best for you and your family and that's very admirable, especially considering the way you're feeling.\n\nI know it's unlikely your wife would agree based on your concerns, but couple's counseling could be a great way for you to go. On the more viable side of things, do you have anyone you could talk to about this? Like a therapist, a family member, or a close friend? Being able to speak openly about how you feel could really help, especially seeing as your wife appears to shut you down from expressing your emotions.\n\nI can't offer much, but I hope things improve. Based on your post, you seem like a caring person and I would love to see things get better for you and your relationship", "A good therapist won\u2019t let that happen. There are rules in couple\u2019s counseling.", "I'm sorry.  Maybe it's time to go.", "I doubt you will have to, once their mother realises the reality of what she told you she will see her mistake", "Right answer. The girls aren\u2019t responsible for your conflict with their mother", "I'm sorry she acted that way. But if you can't speak your mind without her throwing a temper tantrum, then you are correct this is going to get worse and it would have happened even if you didn't say something. Sounds like there are some communication problems in your relationship that need addressed. This goes further than this one incident.", "Your wife is abusive. Her locking you out is abuse. Her refusing to talk to you is abuse. Her making you question your judgement and regret ever voicing your opinion is abuse.\n\nYou don't need marriage counseling. You need therapy for yourself. You don't deserve to be treated this way.", "No I don't really have anyone to talk to. I posted this just so I'd know if my feelings were justified. Like I'm seriously hurt by this. I'm used to her saying things, but this just hit me different. I'm honestly not sure I'd this is something I can get past. This hurt deep.", "She recently became physical as well. I came away with a split lip. Ik this needs to be over but the girls wouldn't have a home or anything. They don't deserve that, they ate good kids. I don't want them  to suffer because my wife has issues. It's not theirs fault. I'd rather be miserable than to think they are going without. It would eat me alive.", "You just admitted to being the victim of DV. What happens if she turns it on the girls and you try to stop her? Cause it will happen most likely. Will she call the police and blame you? Will the girls stand up for you or are they too afraid of mom. You need to get out of this relationship. You can still be there for the girls, let them know if they help they can always call you. Give them your support but get away from her for your own safety. It was a split lip this time - what's next? A broken nose? Arm? When is enough enough?"]}
