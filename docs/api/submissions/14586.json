Our daughter is 13 and our son is 11. She was remarried for 7 years and has two children with her late husband. He died a week ago. My kids were not close to the man. He was a hardass and the kids found him overly strict (and I agree) and they didn't like being around him. The relationship at best was strained but they confided in me over the years that they hoped their mom would leave them. She loved the guy though and when he died last week she was a mess. Our kids were with me when it happened and she wanted to see them so I brought them over. They comforted their mom and she told them, repeatedly, it was okay to cry, it was okay to miss him, that they were all going to miss him. The kids said nothing. She kept repeating it. I told her I thought the kids got it.\n\nWhen the kids saw their mom again she was halfway through planning the funeral and asked if they would be able to do a reading or something for the funeral. The kids said they wouldn't be able to. She was with them a while and then said, since they weren't crying much, maybe they could take a reading and see how they did on the day. Kids told me about it when I spoke to them and they asked if I could talk to their mom. I told my ex not to force the reading.\n\nThe funeral day came. I showed up for my kids. They were hanging back with me a lot, and they told me their mom kept watching them, which I witnessed myself. For the funeral I sat behind them since she wouldn't let them sit with me. She told us that all her husband's kids should be seated up front and I didn't have the heart to tell her they weren't his kids on the day of her husband's funeral when she was such a mess. So I bit my tongue and supported my kids. It was after the service when everything went down.\n\nThe kids came to sit in my car for a while and we were laughing about something. Ex came over and asked how they could be laughing when they had just buried their stepdad and why did they show no grief at all over the loss of the man who was part of their lives for 7 years. She said it was almost like they were glad he was gone. She told them they should have been looking way more somber after he passed. She told them if they really didn't care they clearly needed help because her husband loved them. I stepped in and told her to lay off the kids, they were kids. She told me to stop interfering in how SHE parents our kids. My daughter ended up getting mad at her mom and told her she wasn't sad he was gone, he was an ass and she had always hoped she would leave him. She stormed off and my son followed. Ex was going crazy and I yelled and told her to cut it out and to stop trying to make our kids perform a grieving routine over her husband. I told her they were trying to support her and she should be proud of them for that. She started yelling back at me about what an asshole I am so I walked away.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681279623, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jc690/aita_for_yelling_at_my_ex_and_telling_her_to_stop/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Grief can really do a number on people and I think she may be lashing out as a way to cope. It\u2019s understandable but not okay, and you did a great job of shutting her down.

So we come to you. \n\nYou yelled at your ex about her parenting choices at her husband\u2019s funeral. You did it after she went out of her way to make a bad parenting choice (telling the kids their lack of visible grief was shameful). It sounds to me like you were protecting your kids, and you made an effort to respect their mom, who made that impossible. If you hadn\u2019t visibly come to their defense, it would have been a tacit endorsement of her actions, and that would have been a terrible message.

If in this moment, you took your ex\u2019s side, your kids might have not forgiven you for that. We don\u2019t know what goes on in an home until we live in it. Your kids didn\u2019t like him, and they shouldn\u2019t have to pretend they did.

She needs to recognise her relationship with her husband was separate and her grief should also be separate.

It is wildly inappropriate for your daughter to say that they\u2019re not sad the stepfather has passed away, so it seems to me your children are disrespectful and you suck for encouraging that. \n\nYour children likely have this sentiment because they were upset that your relationship with your ex ended, they got a new parental figure, now have small half siblings, and don\u2019t know how to express their frustration in a healthy way. \n\nIt seems odd to me that your ex wife would demand a reading from your kids when they politely declined, so your ex wife sucks for not respecting their boundaries and being pushy. While your children are disrespectful for saying that they aren\u2019t sad the stepfather died, it is unreasonable to demand they fake being sad for their mother\u2019s benefit. \n\nI think you all will need family therapy, and it\u2019s going to be really important that you are supportive of your children but not at the expense of their mother. Since your daughter is a teenager, this is a make or break bonding moment for your daughter between her and her mom, and you should encourage healthy conversation and growth. This will be difficult since your ex is grieving and is now the sole parent of presumably small children, because if she\u2019s anything like my mom your ex wife might get stuck and hyper focus on your daughter saying she\u2019s not sad the stepfather died. \n\nYour children likely said this to lash out and intentionally hurt your ex wife because they don\u2019t know how to communicate that they are frustrated they made their feelings known but their mom wouldn\u2019t accept it, and continued to force the issue. \n\nAll in all, this is a really unfair situation for your family to be in, and even though this situation in my view was handled poorly, if you can have healthy communication and coparenting with your ex, your family might come out stronger for it.", "YTA.\n\nI can understand them not liking their stepfather but in the car, while your ex is around so probably just as you're getting out of the service, they should not be laughing, and you should have told them to quit it.

He was gruff with the kids, he did not believe in praise, he had a lot of rules and expectations and had those from the very beginning. He was the very same with his own kids.

It\u2019s really sad and terrible  that the kids are going through this, but to be completely unaffected by the death doesn\u2019t make sense to me and I think the mom deserves some grace because she lost her partner.

At the point that I\u2019m asking about, the only sin they\u2019re accused of is failing to appear as sad as their mother wanted them to be. Her loss and feelings are valid, as are theirs. Do you think it\u2019s appropriate that they should be told \u201cignore your feelings and perform for your mother\u201d?\n\nMy understanding is that parents have moral obligations to children, but that children aren\u2019t obliged to take care of their parents emotionally, despite the tremendous cost of incubating, birthing and raising a child. Perhaps, in your culture, this is different, and teenagers are expected to suppress their emotions and instead take care of their parents\u2019 emotions?", "She's obliged to look after them as she chose to give birth, not the other way around. They're not obliged to pretend anything because she's constructed a fantasy she wishes them to participate in. That's not how they feel.

Do the children really feel that way? Idk, I\u2019m going off what was written. \n\nI do feel there at an age to know how their words impact others.

I\u2019m not saying the mom is blameless, but I think OP should have corrected the kids when they said they weren\u2019t sad their stepfather died. \n\nEven if they think that\u2019s true, that\u2019s not the time or place to say something like that. I think OP could have intervened better, but I also think that OP was trying his best to stick up for his kids.

That steps out of distraught. They put distance between themselves and her, she closed that distance and attacked them for something that wasn't involving her.", "And what about the kids she shared with her current husband? She should be focusing on them unless they're showing too much emotion and want your kids to support them, and that's why she's taking it out on your kids. \n\nAnd even if they were sad, forcing someone to cry and be emotional is not healthy at all. You have to be patient with children.", "Now you are backtracking, and it doesn't matter cause you still allowed your daughter to explode like that and said nothing so like I said that still makes you the asshole", "I see what you\u2019re saying, but I think OP could have possibly stopped the conversation, or at least in the moment tell the daughter that what she said is hurtful and not appropriate for this conversation. \n\nI agree this is a difficult situation, nobody was able to communicate very well, and I think OP has a dislike of the stepfather the kids might have picked up on. \n\nI feel for everyone, I just disagree that OP is NTA for the reasons I mentioned above. I think everyone could have done and said things differently, and while I do believe what the daughter said is inappropriate, she\u2019s also a teenager going through complex emotions so I give the kids a break. \n\nI think OP could have removed the kids from the situation by telling them to sit in the car while he had a discussion with his ex wife. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to ascribe my own situations onto this post, but my parents have been divorced since I was 4 and some things were really hard for me when I was the daughter\u2019s age. I think she\u2019s going through a lot more emotions than she\u2019s letting on, but that\u2019s why I feel they should all be in therapy. I think there\u2019s still time for healthy communication and positive growth between OP, the ex, and the kids", "You\u2019re not wrong, but there are multiple stages of grief and I think she latched on to something (the laughter), which triggered her because she\u2019s focusing on her emotions. \n\nI have gone through different kinds of grief, I see my opinion is unpopular but I\u2019m trying to answer OPs questions based on my experience and perspective of the world. \n\nEmpathizing with the mom, for her, her grief may be like a vacuum. She\u2019s likely entering into a depression and is experiencing intense anxiety and fear. The laughter may have triggered her and made her angry, because from her perspective, a loved one just died and *shouldn\u2019t everyone be just as upset as I am?*\n\nI\u2019m not trying to excuse her, because she\u2019s wrong for berating her kids and yelling at them for laughing. Bit in actuality it\u2019s probably not the laughter itself that upset her, rather it could be because the kids were laughing with OP and she likely wasn\u2019t acutely aware that the kids really didn\u2019t care for the stepfather at all. That can be a hard pill to swallow, especially since the SF was in their life for 7 years and the kids themselves are so young. \n\n\nGrief is complex and I don\u2019t think anyone is entirely an asshole here, but there is a lot of room for growth", "I said they did support their mom. They were doing that when I took them to the house after he died. And they were doing so at the service.", "What should OP have said? \u201cYour mother\u2019s grieving. She\u2019s allowed to yell at you for not sharing her feelings. How dare you express your own feelings! Only your mother\u2019s feelings are appropriate!\u201d?"]}
