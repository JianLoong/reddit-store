Our daughter is 13 and our son is 11. She was remarried for 7 years and has two children with her late husband. He died a week ago. My kids were not close to the man. He was a hardass and the kids found him overly strict (and I agree) and they didn't like being around him. The relationship at best was strained but they confided in me over the years that they hoped their mom would leave them. She loved the guy though and when he died last week she was a mess. Our kids were with me when it happened and she wanted to see them so I brought them over. They comforted their mom and she told them, repeatedly, it was okay to cry, it was okay to miss him, that they were all going to miss him. The kids said nothing. She kept repeating it. I told her I thought the kids got it.\n\nWhen the kids saw their mom again she was halfway through planning the funeral and asked if they would be able to do a reading or something for the funeral. The kids said they wouldn't be able to. She was with them a while and then said, since they weren't crying much, maybe they could take a reading and see how they did on the day. Kids told me about it when I spoke to them and they asked if I could talk to their mom. I told my ex not to force the reading.\n\nThe funeral day came. I showed up for my kids. They were hanging back with me a lot, and they told me their mom kept watching them, which I witnessed myself. For the funeral I sat behind them since she wouldn't let them sit with me. She told us that all her husband's kids should be seated up front and I didn't have the heart to tell her they weren't his kids on the day of her husband's funeral when she was such a mess. So I bit my tongue and supported my kids. It was after the service when everything went down.\n\nThe kids came to sit in my car for a while and we were laughing about something. Ex came over and asked how they could be laughing when they had just buried their stepdad and why did they show no grief at all over the loss of the man who was part of their lives for 7 years. She said it was almost like they were glad he was gone. She told them they should have been looking way more somber after he passed. She told them if they really didn't care they clearly needed help because her husband loved them. I stepped in and told her to lay off the kids, they were kids. She told me to stop interfering in how SHE parents our kids. My daughter ended up getting mad at her mom and told her she wasn't sad he was gone, he was an ass and she had always hoped she would leave him. She stormed off and my son followed. Ex was going crazy and I yelled and told her to cut it out and to stop trying to make our kids perform a grieving routine over her husband. I told her they were trying to support her and she should be proud of them for that. She started yelling back at me about what an asshole I am so I walked away.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA more details on why my kids had issues with him.\n\nHe spoke to them like they were soldiers and he was their commanding officer. That was how he spoke to his own kids too. Barking orders at them. Also very strict on how they sat and stood (posture). Was very tough on them regarding what extra curricular activities they wanted to do. He had his own ideas of what kids should do and my son especially wasn't interested in the sport aspect and that was not what my ex's late husband liked to hear. He also didn't believe kids should be helped with homework beyond kindergarten and did not like how the kids would react to seeing me during exchanges. He believed kids should act \"civilized at all times\" and them taking off running and jumping into my arms was something he did not approve of and said it to them (though not in front of me after I told him it was what we do).

Do you think it\u2019s appropriate that they should be told \u201cignore your feelings and perform for your mother\u201d?\n\nMy understanding is that parents have moral obligations to children, but that children aren\u2019t obliged to take care of their parents emotionally, despite the tremendous cost of incubating, birthing and raising a child. Perhaps, in your culture, this is different, and teenagers are expected to suppress their emotions and instead take care of their parents\u2019 emotions?", "She's obliged to look after them as she chose to give birth, not the other way around.

She should be focusing on them unless they're showing too much emotion and want your kids to support them, and that's why she's taking it out on your kids. \n\nAnd even if they were sad, forcing someone to cry and be emotional is not healthy at all.

I think everyone could have done and said things differently, and while I do believe what the daughter said is inappropriate, she\u2019s also a teenager going through complex emotions so I give the kids a break. \n\nI think OP could have removed the kids from the situation by telling them to sit in the car while he had a discussion with his ex wife. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to ascribe my own situations onto this post, but my parents have been divorced since I was 4 and some things were really hard for me when I was the daughter\u2019s age.

She\u2019s likely entering into a depression and is experiencing intense anxiety and fear. The laughter may have triggered her and made her angry, because from her perspective, a loved one just died and *shouldn\u2019t everyone be just as upset as I am?*\n\nI\u2019m not trying to excuse her, because she\u2019s wrong for berating her kids and yelling at them for laughing. Bit in actuality it\u2019s probably not the laughter itself that upset her, rather it could be because the kids were laughing with OP and she likely wasn\u2019t acutely aware that the kids really didn\u2019t care for the stepfather at all. That can be a hard pill to swallow, especially since the SF was in their life for 7 years and the kids themselves are so young. \n\n\nGrief is complex and I don\u2019t think anyone is entirely an asshole here, but there is a lot of room for growth", "I said they did support their mom.

I don't think he's a bad parent I'm sure he did what he thought was best for his kid's. During an exceptionally tough time at that. I do think his description of things doesn't read very empathetic of their mom.

At the last funeral I attended, someone tripped walking down the hill and everyone just laughed (including the girl who fell). \n\nMy partner, who's grandmother's funeral we were at, actually made a joke that the registration on the funeral car was 777, saying \"good thing it isn't 666\". Doesn't mean he didn't love her, he just jokes sometimes to keep it light.", "Agreed. One of my good friends took her life a few years ago, and we were all absolutely devastated. Her dad still greeted us warmly as he always would. And all of her friends gathered afterwards to share funny stories about her and laughed, because that\u2019s what she would have wanted. And we want to remember the good times. There\u2019s nothing wrong with sharing happy stories or even a few laughs.", "Did she make a poor choice in her grief? Absolutely. The bigger issue is that this guy was an abusive asshole to her children for years and she was fine with it.", "She turned a blind eye for years to her kids emotional wellbeing and did a shit job at blending. That alone makes her an asshole.", "I worry that these kids already resent their mom for choosing a husband who emotionally abused them for 7 years, and then she attacked them for not being upset when he died. Mom failed to protect them from the stepdad\u2019s abuse and now she\u2019s projecting HER grief onto them, and expecting them to make HER feel better? Bruh. \n\nThose poor kids. I\u2019m glad OP has them in therapy.", "They\u2019re young kids. It\u2019s not their responsibility to meet their adult mother\u2019s emotional needs.

Why could the children not do that? \n\nOk they didn\u2019t want to fair enough, he was still their stepdad for 7 years! YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE LET YOUR CHILDREN TALK SHIT ABOUT THEIR STEPFATHER INFRONT OF YOUR GRIEVING EX. \n\nShe obviously thought the kids liked him a lot more and to hear that shit AT HIS FUNERAL is a slap across the face. \n\nJust because they weren\u2019t his kids doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t care for them or look after them. Esh mum shouldn\u2019t have been pushing but can you blame her?

Are you taking the piss?!", "Even if OPs kids loved their stepdad, it\u2019s not their moms place to tell them how they should be grieving.

The correcting of posture etc, and worse, telling them to behave when they run happily towards their dad at exchanges. What goes on inside a person's mind when they tell kids to not show love and joy? he must have been several kinds of fucked up. \n\nAs there's already resentment from the funeral, well actually even before the funeral, it's likely the mother will keep feeling resentful towards her kids who don't feel the same as her (and wouldn't, even if he had been a loving step-dad). \n\nIt's hard to be around someone in grief who are bitter about it, especially when guilt is thrown around at innocent bystanders, and kids being more inclined to feel guilt.. \n\nI hope OP can be a safe and solid rock for his kids.", "Sometimes when we recognise someone being an AH BECAUSE they're sick/upset, we just have to say \"okay, we can revisit this\", or walk away.

I was sad and numb but didn't cry at all until about the last 5 minutes of her funeral when we sang one of her favorite hymns. I'm not religious and haven't attended church since I was 18 but that was when I lost it and just bawled. It's been almost 25 years now and I think I've cried once over her since then.\n\nWe all grieve in our own way.

At the end of the service they asked people to share memories of her, or read a joke in her memory. There was a lot of laughter and some tears as well, and I think it was good closure for my cousin, who had had to be the responsible kid keeping shit together for her little siblings at age 11 because of my aunt's drinking. And for my mom and other aunt, who had to clean up a lot of her messes over the years. \n\nShe wasn't a horrible person. She was probably undiagnosed autistic, a hoarder, and chronically inappropriate in public. She was an alcoholic and her kids had to raise themselves. She didn't abuse them, she loved them deeply. But she neglected them and raised them in a filthy house and probably crossed all kinds of emotional boundaries telling them her adult problems. So, yk, she left a lot of complicated feelings. \n\nAnyway it was a great funeral and I think she'd have appreciated it.", "Yes, I remember the drive to the graveyard to bury a friend of mine, laughing and making jokes with the other pallbearers.  It wasn't that we didn't care, we were fucking devastated.  But after spending the service crying, we needed a bit of relief before we had to carry our friend to his final resting place.  Grief is complicated, and there's nothing wrong with sharing some jokes or funny stories about the deceased, as long as you are not being disrespectful.  And kids especially will process things differently.", "> I will give the ex-wife some leeway insofar as her grief is clouding her rationality...\n\nShe's an asshole but arguably a relatively easily forgivable asshole... if she does right going forward.\n\nNot sure if she was delusional about the state of the kid's relationship with her late husband, but severe grief could sure make you delusional about the person that just died but eventually, they can break that delusion if that's the case. If its more of the latter than former, she is more on the forgivable side of assholeness. If she's *always* been like this, her husband's death may have destroyed any chance of her accepting reality and not having it damage her relationship with the kids.\n\nThe guy is could basically be on martyr level for her and she cannot and will not accept meaningful negative truths about the guy no matter the consequences of holding on to those fantasies in her head of the man. Even if it costs her a relationship with her kids.", "I recognize that mom and have sympathy for her loss as a person but none, absolutely none, for how she let her kids be treated. She failed them over and over long before this most recent failure. Abuse is never to be excused. \n\nShe didn't protect them from their step father, why would she come to her senses now? Either way we protect kids first. Above adult feelings . OP is a great dad.", "I have to politely disagree. Based on how OP says the step-father treated them *and* the fact that the kids really aren\u2019t grieving and don\u2019t miss him, I think the mom spent the last seven years deluding herself. The idea that they had a happy home and that OP\u2019s kids should be devastated suggests that she\u2019s labored under this delusion all along; it\u2019s not a sudden outburst born of grief.", ">What do you honestly expect?\n  \nI expect them to be able to act serious for a single day, and for the dad to help reinforce respectful behavior to support the mom.

It was.  I know your brain shuts down in that situation, but in hindsight the correct reaction would have been to yell very loudly \"Get your hand off my thigh right now\".  I don't know if I would have had the presence of mind to do that myself.

Ngl it sounds like you have some resentment built up for the mother of your kids. I understand a bit about coparenting and one thing I would never do is check my son's mom right in front of him. It hurts the relationship between kid and parent when you do things like that and its in everyone's best interest to try and understand where your wife is coming from.

Especially as he was standing up for his kids. \n\nThe reason I suggested he try and maintain a diplomatic tone is to protect both him and his children.

I feel bad for the mother because she is grieving, but she needs to start backing off on trying to make the kids be what she wants them to be. The thirteen year old is at that age where she has a mind of her own. It their mother doesn't change, she will drive them away. Also, I get annoyed when people equate grief with crying.

If you know your ex wife is a good mom, you would want her to have that support right? Which is why I'm wondering if there's still issues between you two? For me, you absolutely were the asshole for laughing at/after a funeral service where its a matter of respect to show up in dark cloths and be there for those who are grieving. That doesn't mean you can't be happy at all, or even celebrating their life at a party after the service is over, but when the widow is emotional and wants to know whats so funny about the situation, thats the moment that you could have apologized and taught your kids how to support a grieving person.
