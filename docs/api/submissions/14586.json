Our daughter is 13 and our son is 11. She was remarried for 7 years and has two children with her late husband. He died a week ago. My kids were not close to the man. He was a hardass and the kids found him overly strict (and I agree) and they didn't like being around him. The relationship at best was strained but they confided in me over the years that they hoped their mom would leave them. She loved the guy though and when he died last week she was a mess. Our kids were with me when it happened and she wanted to see them so I brought them over. They comforted their mom and she told them, repeatedly, it was okay to cry, it was okay to miss him, that they were all going to miss him. The kids said nothing. She kept repeating it. I told her I thought the kids got it.\n\nWhen the kids saw their mom again she was halfway through planning the funeral and asked if they would be able to do a reading or something for the funeral. The kids said they wouldn't be able to. She was with them a while and then said, since they weren't crying much, maybe they could take a reading and see how they did on the day. Kids told me about it when I spoke to them and they asked if I could talk to their mom. I told my ex not to force the reading.\n\nThe funeral day came. I showed up for my kids. They were hanging back with me a lot, and they told me their mom kept watching them, which I witnessed myself. For the funeral I sat behind them since she wouldn't let them sit with me. She told us that all her husband's kids should be seated up front and I didn't have the heart to tell her they weren't his kids on the day of her husband's funeral when she was such a mess. So I bit my tongue and supported my kids. It was after the service when everything went down.\n\nThe kids came to sit in my car for a while and we were laughing about something. Ex came over and asked how they could be laughing when they had just buried their stepdad and why did they show no grief at all over the loss of the man who was part of their lives for 7 years. She said it was almost like they were glad he was gone. She told them they should have been looking way more somber after he passed. She told them if they really didn't care they clearly needed help because her husband loved them. I stepped in and told her to lay off the kids, they were kids. She told me to stop interfering in how SHE parents our kids. My daughter ended up getting mad at her mom and told her she wasn't sad he was gone, he was an ass and she had always hoped she would leave him. She stormed off and my son followed. Ex was going crazy and I yelled and told her to cut it out and to stop trying to make our kids perform a grieving routine over her husband. I told her they were trying to support her and she should be proud of them for that. She started yelling back at me about what an asshole I am so I walked away.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681279623, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jc690/aita_for_yelling_at_my_ex_and_telling_her_to_stop/", "score": 1643, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like your ex had her head buried in the sand and just kept telling herself \"I have a full happy blended family.\" She was blind (or turned a blind eye) to the relationship (or lack thereof) that her deceased husband had with your kids.", "NTA and we now have some insight as to why she's your ex.", "NTA but why on earth does your ex think these kids would grieve for a man who was a hard ass with them? \n\nMight be time to revisit custody agreement... doesn't sound like the kids need that kind of emotional bs directed their way.", "NTA. Grief can really do a number on people and I think she may be lashing out as a way to cope. It\u2019s understandable but not okay, and you did a great job of shutting her down.

Obviously, your ex is an AH for pushing the kids to performative grieving. Your daughter was pretty rude to her mom, maybe crossing over into AH territory, but she was pushed into it pretty hard, so I\u2019m not sure about my judgement of her. Your son gets a pass. So we come to you. \n\nYou yelled at your ex about her parenting choices at her husband\u2019s funeral. You did it after she went out of her way to make a bad parenting choice (telling the kids their lack of visible grief was shameful). It sounds to me like you were protecting your kids, and you made an effort to respect their mom, who made that impossible. If you hadn\u2019t visibly come to their defense, it would have been a tacit endorsement of her actions, and that would have been a terrible message.

I think it was the right thing to do to stand up for your kids. And it was good of your children to want to support their mother.

I think you were as kind as you could be with your delivery.\n\nWhen my brother's dad died (I don't use the other term for that horrible person), I was relieved that I would never have to see him again and that my brother was saved from being around such a selfish and cruel person.

It took a few years for that to happen. Good luck.", "NTA - your ex wants the kids to put up some show? It\u2019s way worse than accept their feelings and move forward.

I think your ex has probably been forcing the relationship between the kids and their stepdad for years and now you\u2019re getting to witness it first hand. \n\nYou supported your kids and your ex as best you could, that\u2019s what counts. If in this moment, you took your ex\u2019s side, your kids might have not forgiven you for that. We don\u2019t know what goes on in an home until we live in it. Your kids didn\u2019t like him, and they shouldn\u2019t have to pretend they did. They showed up to support their mum, that\u2019s more than enough. \n\nYour ex needs therapy, she\u2019s trying to grieve through her kids which isn\u2019t right. She needs to recognise her relationship with her husband was separate and her grief should also be separate. The kids not feeling a certain way doesn\u2019t change anything about how important this man was to her. You should also probably consider keeping the kids a bit longer cause I think your ex would do well with some space while she processes this.", "Nta. They acted very mature for their age.\nAnd even if they were grieving, everyone does it differently. \n\nMy opinion as a non proffesional anything is that you did everything perfectly. And maybe she should focus on the kids that actually lost a father instead of watching like a hawk those  with one non grieving parent to look after them.", "Edit: I wrote a lot of comments to further explain how I interpreted the post and responded. I believe the wife is more TA than OP or the kids, but I believe this was a shitty situation and there\u2019s a lot of room for growth.\n\nBased on this information and the discussion in the comments, I\u2019m going to amend my comment to NTA because at the end of the day, your wife shouldn\u2019t have reacted towards your kids that way. It is wrong of her to push you and the kids, to try to force them to do a eulogy, and to be aggressive towards them because they aren\u2019t grieving how she expected.\n\n AMENDED to NTA, but my original comment is below. \n\nYour ex is grieving a serious loss, and is shocked at both the suddenness of the death and how callous you and your children are. \n\nYou don\u2019t give examples for how the decedent was strict, so I\u2019m assuming he parented your children in a manner not agreeable to you. It is wildly inappropriate for your daughter to say that they\u2019re not sad the stepfather has passed away, so it seems to me your children are disrespectful and you suck for encouraging that. \n\nYour children likely have this sentiment because they were upset that your relationship with your ex ended, they got a new parental figure, now have small half siblings, and don\u2019t know how to express their frustration in a healthy way. \n\nIt seems odd to me that your ex wife would demand a reading from your kids when they politely declined, so your ex wife sucks for not respecting their boundaries and being pushy. While your children are disrespectful for saying that they aren\u2019t sad the stepfather died, it is unreasonable to demand they fake being sad for their mother\u2019s benefit. \n\nI think you all will need family therapy, and it\u2019s going to be really important that you are supportive of your children but not at the expense of their mother. Since your daughter is a teenager, this is a make or break bonding moment for your daughter between her and her mom, and you should encourage healthy conversation and growth. This will be difficult since your ex is grieving and is now the sole parent of presumably small children, because if she\u2019s anything like my mom your ex wife might get stuck and hyper focus on your daughter saying she\u2019s not sad the stepfather died. \n\nYour children likely said this to lash out and intentionally hurt your ex wife because they don\u2019t know how to communicate that they are frustrated they made their feelings known but their mom wouldn\u2019t accept it, and continued to force the issue. \n\nAll in all, this is a really unfair situation for your family to be in, and even though this situation in my view was handled poorly, if you can have healthy communication and coparenting with your ex, your family might come out stronger for it.", "YTA.\n\nI can understand them not liking their stepfather but in the car, while your ex is around so probably just as you're getting out of the service, they should not be laughing, and you should have told them to quit it.

That steps out of distraught. They put distance between themselves and her, she closed that distance and attacked them for something that wasn't involving her.", "And what about the kids she shared with her current husband? She should be focusing on them unless they're showing too much emotion and want your kids to support them, and that's why she's taking it out on your kids. \n\nAnd even if they were sad, forcing someone to cry and be emotional is not healthy at all. You have to be patient with children.", "[deleted]", "I see what you\u2019re saying, but I think OP could have possibly stopped the conversation, or at least in the moment tell the daughter that what she said is hurtful and not appropriate for this conversation. \n\nI agree this is a difficult situation, nobody was able to communicate very well, and I think OP has a dislike of the stepfather the kids might have picked up on. \n\nI feel for everyone, I just disagree that OP is NTA for the reasons I mentioned above. I think everyone could have done and said things differently, and while I do believe what the daughter said is inappropriate, she\u2019s also a teenager going through complex emotions so I give the kids a break. \n\nI think OP could have removed the kids from the situation by telling them to sit in the car while he had a discussion with his ex wife. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to ascribe my own situations onto this post, but my parents have been divorced since I was 4 and some things were really hard for me when I was the daughter\u2019s age. I think she\u2019s going through a lot more emotions than she\u2019s letting on, but that\u2019s why I feel they should all be in therapy. I think there\u2019s still time for healthy communication and positive growth between OP, the ex, and the kids", "You\u2019re not wrong, but there are multiple stages of grief and I think she latched on to something (the laughter), which triggered her because she\u2019s focusing on her emotions. \n\nI have gone through different kinds of grief, I see my opinion is unpopular but I\u2019m trying to answer OPs questions based on my experience and perspective of the world. \n\nEmpathizing with the mom, for her, her grief may be like a vacuum.

He had his own ideas of what kids should do and my son especially wasn't interested in the sport aspect and that was not what my ex's late husband liked to hear.

The rose colored glasses come on, and issues with the deceased get forgotten.   It's normal to want to remember your loved one well.

However, that's how I grew up, believing that she was such a wonderful person and her daughter was a unlucky girl. Later on, I realised that they were a couple of bad bitches.

It was a sign of love and comfort that we could be happy and remince on the good times. \n\n\nHowever, my father died in middle school. I hated him. There were no smiles or laughing at his funeral.", "You've never been to an Irish wake", "They weren\u2019t at the actual service. OP states that this happened afterwards when everyone gathered at the mom\u2019s house. How long are kids not allowed to play after a funeral?", "Honestly, it sounds like it\u2019s been \u201cabout their mom\u201d for the past several years. She wasn\u2019t looking out for their best interest when she chose a husband that was cold and overly critical toward them. OP has provided multiple examples of him being controlling and unkind toward his kids. Now she is projecting HER grief onto the kids and is mad that they aren\u2019t as devastated as she is? Nah, fuck that. I don\u2019t think any kids wouldn\u2019t like an adult figure in their lives who treated them that way. He gets credit for at least being \u201cfair\u201d in his shitty treatment toward all of the kids, but he gave them no reason to feel warm or loving towards him.", "All irrelevant. Yes, asking people to make pretend at a funeral is asking too much. Freaking out and screaming at children laughing with their father in his car, away from the mourners, is too much. \n\nYes, the kids are, by all accounts, relieved if not out happy this man is out of their lives. It kind of says a bit about how they viewed him. \n\nThey were trying to comfort and support their mother. But what did she expect, the kids to break down into a sobbing mess and throw themselves onto the coffin?", "The kids showed up to support their mom because they love her. They feel like she's watching them the whole time. Then she gets mad and lashes out at them for not being sad. They were only there for their mom. Not because of her husband and it wasn't good enough for my ex. She wanted to see them perform grief that they did not feel. I understand SHE'S grieving but you can't force others to grieve along with you when they don't feel it.", "Soft Y T A is an absolutely incriminating vote on your behalf.  The late step father abused them and you are going out of your way to try and vilify the father who went out of his way to be a good parent.  You\u2019re coming off as a real creep", "I'm sorry to hear that you grew up in a situation that made you believe the reasons OP have stated are normal, but acknowledging that you didn't have a normal upbringing is a good start towards making sure you don't continue the cycle.\n\nYou mentioned disrespect a lot in your original comment, but what I hope you realize is that respect is a two way street. Even with children.\n\nIt doesn't sound like that man ever did much, if anything, to try and earn the respect of his step-kids. The fact that their mother allowed him to pretty much come in and become a more strict \"father\" figure than their own biological father (who sounds like he's got the kids best interest in mind) was disrespectful from their mother to the children.\n\nHopefully this experience is the wakeup call she needs to protect her relationship with her children, because she'll be at risk of losing it when they grow up should she try to whitewash their memory of him. She's especially likely to lose the relationships if she gets with another man like her late husband.\n\nFocusing on the children being \"disrespectful\" is missing the forest for a tree. Was it hurtful for her daughter to say that, and compound her grief? Yes. Was it something she needed to hear? Probably also yes, if she doesn't want her relationships with her children to crumble.", "He wasn\u2019t laughing at the funeral. After they went back to the mum\u2019s house, the kids wanted a breather so they want to the car. *That\u2019s* where they were laughing.\n\nAnd so many people laugh at funerals, remembering the deceased and funny stories. That\u2019s how people process grief as well. OP didn\u2019t do anything wrong, in fact he did more than he had to.", "No they don't. Family is not a transaction.", "a fake reaction out of kids who weren\u2019t even related to him?", "No. Talk to my mother and she will wax poetic about my stepfather, who died in 2016. She'll tell you how generous and loving and kind he was. How he always went to church and everyone loved him.\n\nShe wont tell you about how every single one of his adult children is an alcoholic with extreme trauma caused by him. She wont tell you that he wasnt on speaking terms with his brother or best friend for 15+ years. She wont tell you his youngest son drank himself to death due to his father's abuse. She won't tell you that he used to call me a wh*re and a sl*t because I'm a girl. Or that he threatened to physically assault my toddler son. She won't tell you that every single one of her family members absolutely hated him. \n\nIf they excuse the abuse whole it's happening, they'll excuse it forever.", "Yep grief makes people behave really irrationally especially if it\u2019s the loss of someone very close. My mother was horrible to me when her ex died. It had nothing to do with me but I\u2019ve witnessed first hand how grief can make people almost psychotic. Still - doesn\u2019t mean the kids should suffer and OP is obviously right for wanting to protect them from this.", "I think she lost that a while ago.", "No.\n\nBut should be watched carefully because the situation could so easily get there from here.", "I do.", "Ahhh, the ex-military or current military jackass who thinks if it's good for grown adult volunteers it's good for small children. And gets offended that children aren't just little adults. I am familiar with it, my dad was similar. \n\nIf your kids aren't in therapy OP, maybe they should be since authoritarian parenting is often emotionally and physically abusive and their mother is engaging in emotional abuse. Hopefully I'm over-reacting but my dad gave me PTSD, so.", "Yikes. It sounds like your ex was really in denial about the impact this guy was having on her children. \n\nSo much toxic masculinity at play - I am guessing he wanted to be military or police and was never accepted. He sounds so insecure. \n\nYou are definitely NTA, because you realised that confronting your ex with your kid\u2019s true feelings during the funeral would be bad for everyone. Unfortunately your ex pushed it, and she got the truth. \n\nGood for you for having your kids best interests at heart. \n\nIt is horrible to acknowledge that sometimes we are better off when a person in our life dies. It is very confronting - there can be guilt that comes with acknowledging it. Sounds like your kids have a great support in you.", "Did this guy have a ton of money or something? Why on earth would a mother tolerate a man treating her kids this way?", "Omg sounds abusive. No wonder your kids never liked him. NTA OP.", "It's sounds like the funeral was a happy occasion for your kids. Some people are just better being out of your life. He didn't need to die for it, but at the moment that seemed to be the only way to achieve that for your kids.", "I\u2019m shocked your ex was OK with him treating your kids like that, and her still being (willfully) ignorant of their feelings for him. Her current behavior is also appalling, though people who just lost a loved one are seldom at their best behavior.\n\nYour ex sounds like someone who needs therapy but doesn\u2019t realize it yet. Her or the late ex-stepdad\u2019s behavior may very well have left its trail already; c-PTSD from growing up in an unhealthy environment is real.", "Definitely NTA but did you never put this man in his place? He is a stepdad so has no say how your kids interact with you and as far as extra curricular activities go that's down to you and the kids mum. In all honesty the kids are probably relieved this man is gone as they don't have to deal with a drill sergeant at home. Hopefully the mum deals with her grief and realises how much she has fucked up.", "\u2026.your ex is an AH. If that\u2019s how he wanted to parent his kids\u2026.yikes, but ok. But this is way overstepping as a stepparent.", "> She told them if they really didn't care they clearly needed help\n\nThis is what pushed to NTA for me; there's grieving and there's implying someone is wrong in the head because they aren't grieving like you... that's something horrible to say to your own children. :(", "they were still present at the funeral. op clearly disliked the late husband but i\u2019m sure if it was a member of his family he\u2019d have told them it wasn\u2019t appropriate", "so long as they are still AT the funeral", "Ignore them. You did everything correctly. Both you and your children have been acting in caring and supportive ways. \n\nYou only intervened after your ex began shouting at your children about not crying over a man they didn't care for.\n\nThere is a limit to how much empathy people deserve. And screaming at children for not being sad at the \"loss\" of a person they don't like is it.", "Them standing at a podium and reading some lines of a poem about loss or quotes about life isn't a circus act it's a service act. \nIt's clear you're resistant to the idea things could've been handled differently for mom's sake but as a parent I'm sure you made the best of a tough situation.", "Love is not just about showing up. You are encouraging your kids to equate love/support with just showing up and then getting frustrated the moment the person they are there to support shows anything but appreciation for their presence. Supporting people means accepting that they may not be their best self and it\u2019s ok! Not to get into some petty squabble and making them feel worse for having an emotional response.\n\nTo the point this comment was directed toward, the empathy is missing. This woman just lost someone she truly loved and is devastated, and of course it\u2019s going to hurt so bad when she hears that her kids had reserved feelings about this person all along and can\u2019t even set that aside to support her through this experience. \n\nI hope you reconsider how you are framing this relationship between your kids and their mother. It\u2019s OK for someone to be grieving, struggling, mourning, it\u2019s OK for them to react in a way that isn\u2019t exactly what you want or expect. Their love for that person should include offering them the space to experience those feelings.\n\nYTA", "Are we just not going to acknowledge that the step dad was needlessly cruel to these kids for 7 years?

That's rough...", "My kids have been going to therapy for the last four years.", ">who thinks if it's good for grown adult volunteers\n\nGood enough for (barely) grown adults -- people didn't (and in some places, still don't) always volunteer to be in the military, and drill sergeants certainly weren't easier on them.\n\nJust a technically.

Those kids met the limit and anything this mother does but thank them for their support is out of line?", "I think it's a good idea to make sure the therapist is aware of this recent incident.
