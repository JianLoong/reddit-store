Our daughter is 13 and our son is 11. She was remarried for 7 years and has two children with her late husband. He died a week ago. My kids were not close to the man. He was a hardass and the kids found him overly strict (and I agree) and they didn't like being around him. The relationship at best was strained but they confided in me over the years that they hoped their mom would leave them. She loved the guy though and when he died last week she was a mess. Our kids were with me when it happened and she wanted to see them so I brought them over. They comforted their mom and she told them, repeatedly, it was okay to cry, it was okay to miss him, that they were all going to miss him. The kids said nothing. She kept repeating it. I told her I thought the kids got it.\n\nWhen the kids saw their mom again she was halfway through planning the funeral and asked if they would be able to do a reading or something for the funeral. The kids said they wouldn't be able to. She was with them a while and then said, since they weren't crying much, maybe they could take a reading and see how they did on the day. Kids told me about it when I spoke to them and they asked if I could talk to their mom. I told my ex not to force the reading.\n\nThe funeral day came. I showed up for my kids. They were hanging back with me a lot, and they told me their mom kept watching them, which I witnessed myself. For the funeral I sat behind them since she wouldn't let them sit with me. She told us that all her husband's kids should be seated up front and I didn't have the heart to tell her they weren't his kids on the day of her husband's funeral when she was such a mess. So I bit my tongue and supported my kids. It was after the service when everything went down.\n\nThe kids came to sit in my car for a while and we were laughing about something. Ex came over and asked how they could be laughing when they had just buried their stepdad and why did they show no grief at all over the loss of the man who was part of their lives for 7 years. She said it was almost like they were glad he was gone. She told them they should have been looking way more somber after he passed. She told them if they really didn't care they clearly needed help because her husband loved them. I stepped in and told her to lay off the kids, they were kids. She told me to stop interfering in how SHE parents our kids. My daughter ended up getting mad at her mom and told her she wasn't sad he was gone, he was an ass and she had always hoped she would leave him. She stormed off and my son followed. Ex was going crazy and I yelled and told her to cut it out and to stop trying to make our kids perform a grieving routine over her husband. I told her they were trying to support her and she should be proud of them for that.

Grief can really do a number on people and I think she may be lashing out as a way to cope. It\u2019s understandable but not okay, and you did a great job of shutting her down. She should go into grief counseling ASAP and I think it could be worth it to have a conversation with your kids about the things she said and why they\u2019re wrong. \n\nBest of luck.", "It\u2019s not great to have a screaming fight at a funeral. Obviously, your ex is an AH for pushing the kids to performative grieving. Your daughter was pretty rude to her mom, maybe crossing over into AH territory, but she was pushed into it pretty hard, so I\u2019m not sure about my judgement of her. Your son gets a pass. So we come to you. \n\nYou yelled at your ex about her parenting choices at her husband\u2019s funeral. You did it after she went out of her way to make a bad parenting choice (telling the kids their lack of visible grief was shameful). It sounds to me like you were protecting your kids, and you made an effort to respect their mom, who made that impossible. If you hadn\u2019t visibly come to their defense, it would have been a tacit endorsement of her actions, and that would have been a terrible message.

I think it was the right thing to do to stand up for your kids. And it was good of your children to want to support their mother. Your ex didn't see the man for who he was when he was alive, so she isn't going to do it now or (probably) ever. This is probably going to come up again, but stick to your instincts. I think you were as kind as you could be with your delivery.\n\nWhen my brother's dad died (I don't use the other term for that horrible person), I was relieved that I would never have to see him again and that my brother was saved from being around such a selfish and cruel person.

It took a few years for that to happen. Good luck.", "NTA - your ex wants the kids to put up some show? It\u2019s way worse than accept their feelings and move forward.

I think your ex has probably been forcing the relationship between the kids and their stepdad for years and now you\u2019re getting to witness it first hand. \n\nYou supported your kids and your ex as best you could, that\u2019s what counts. If in this moment, you took your ex\u2019s side, your kids might have not forgiven you for that. We don\u2019t know what goes on in an home until we live in it. Your kids didn\u2019t like him, and they shouldn\u2019t have to pretend they did. They showed up to support their mum, that\u2019s more than enough. \n\nYour ex needs therapy, she\u2019s trying to grieve through her kids which isn\u2019t right. She needs to recognise her relationship with her husband was separate and her grief should also be separate. The kids not feeling a certain way doesn\u2019t change anything about how important this man was to her. You should also probably consider keeping the kids a bit longer cause I think your ex would do well with some space while she processes this.", "Nta. They acted very mature for their age.\nAnd even if they were grieving, everyone does it differently. \n\nMy opinion as a non proffesional anything is that you did everything perfectly. And maybe she should focus on the kids that actually lost a father instead of watching like a hawk those  with one non grieving parent to look after them.", "Edit: I wrote a lot of comments to further explain how I interpreted the post and responded. I believe the wife is more TA than OP or the kids, but I believe this was a shitty situation and there\u2019s a lot of room for growth.\n\nBased on this information and the discussion in the comments, I\u2019m going to amend my comment to NTA because at the end of the day, your wife shouldn\u2019t have reacted towards your kids that way. It is wrong of her to push you and the kids, to try to force them to do a eulogy, and to be aggressive towards them because they aren\u2019t grieving how she expected.\n\n AMENDED to NTA, but my original comment is below. \n\nYour ex is grieving a serious loss, and is shocked at both the suddenness of the death and how callous you and your children are. \n\nYou don\u2019t give examples for how the decedent was strict, so I\u2019m assuming he parented your children in a manner not agreeable to you. It is wildly inappropriate for your daughter to say that they\u2019re not sad the stepfather has passed away, so it seems to me your children are disrespectful and you suck for encouraging that. \n\nYour children likely have this sentiment because they were upset that your relationship with your ex ended, they got a new parental figure, now have small half siblings, and don\u2019t know how to express their frustration in a healthy way. \n\nIt seems odd to me that your ex wife would demand a reading from your kids when they politely declined, so your ex wife sucks for not respecting their boundaries and being pushy. While your children are disrespectful for saying that they aren\u2019t sad the stepfather died, it is unreasonable to demand they fake being sad for their mother\u2019s benefit. \n\nI think you all will need family therapy, and it\u2019s going to be really important that you are supportive of your children but not at the expense of their mother. Since your daughter is a teenager, this is a make or break bonding moment for your daughter between her and her mom, and you should encourage healthy conversation and growth. This will be difficult since your ex is grieving and is now the sole parent of presumably small children, because if she\u2019s anything like my mom your ex wife might get stuck and hyper focus on your daughter saying she\u2019s not sad the stepfather died. \n\nYour children likely said this to lash out and intentionally hurt your ex wife because they don\u2019t know how to communicate that they are frustrated they made their feelings known but their mom wouldn\u2019t accept it, and continued to force the issue. \n\nAll in all, this is a really unfair situation for your family to be in, and even though this situation in my view was handled poorly, if you can have healthy communication and coparenting with your ex, your family might come out stronger for it.", "YTA.\n\nI can understand them not liking their stepfather but in the car, while your ex is around so probably just as you're getting out of the service, they should not be laughing, and you should have told them to quit it.

Perhaps, in your culture, this is different, and teenagers are expected to suppress their emotions and instead take care of their parents\u2019 emotions?", "She's obliged to look after them as she chose to give birth, not the other way around.

I\u2019m not saying the mom is blameless, but I think OP should have corrected the kids when they said they weren\u2019t sad their stepfather died. \n\nEven if they think that\u2019s true, that\u2019s not the time or place to say something like that. I think OP could have intervened better, but I also think that OP was trying his best to stick up for his kids.

That steps out of distraught. They put distance between themselves and her, she closed that distance and attacked them for something that wasn't involving her.", "And what about the kids she shared with her current husband? She should be focusing on them unless they're showing too much emotion and want your kids to support them, and that's why she's taking it out on your kids. \n\nAnd even if they were sad, forcing someone to cry and be emotional is not healthy at all. You have to be patient with children.", "Now you are backtracking, and it doesn't matter cause you still allowed your daughter to explode like that and said nothing so like I said that still makes you the asshole", "I see what you\u2019re saying, but I think OP could have possibly stopped the conversation, or at least in the moment tell the daughter that what she said is hurtful and not appropriate for this conversation. \n\nI agree this is a difficult situation, nobody was able to communicate very well, and I think OP has a dislike of the stepfather the kids might have picked up on. \n\nI feel for everyone, I just disagree that OP is NTA for the reasons I mentioned above. I think everyone could have done and said things differently, and while I do believe what the daughter said is inappropriate, she\u2019s also a teenager going through complex emotions so I give the kids a break. \n\nI think OP could have removed the kids from the situation by telling them to sit in the car while he had a discussion with his ex wife. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to ascribe my own situations onto this post, but my parents have been divorced since I was 4 and some things were really hard for me when I was the daughter\u2019s age. I think she\u2019s going through a lot more emotions than she\u2019s letting on, but that\u2019s why I feel they should all be in therapy. I think there\u2019s still time for healthy communication and positive growth between OP, the ex, and the kids", "You\u2019re not wrong, but there are multiple stages of grief and I think she latched on to something (the laughter), which triggered her because she\u2019s focusing on her emotions. \n\nI have gone through different kinds of grief, I see my opinion is unpopular but I\u2019m trying to answer OPs questions based on my experience and perspective of the world. \n\nEmpathizing with the mom, for her, her grief may be like a vacuum. She\u2019s likely entering into a depression and is experiencing intense anxiety and fear. The laughter may have triggered her and made her angry, because from her perspective, a loved one just died and *shouldn\u2019t everyone be just as upset as I am?*\n\nI\u2019m not trying to excuse her, because she\u2019s wrong for berating her kids and yelling at them for laughing. Bit in actuality it\u2019s probably not the laughter itself that upset her, rather it could be because the kids were laughing with OP and she likely wasn\u2019t acutely aware that the kids really didn\u2019t care for the stepfather at all. That can be a hard pill to swallow, especially since the SF was in their life for 7 years and the kids themselves are so young. \n\n\nGrief is complex and I don\u2019t think anyone is entirely an asshole here, but there is a lot of room for growth", "I said they did support their mom. They were doing that when I took them to the house after he died. And they were doing so at the service.", "What should OP have said? \u201cYour mother\u2019s grieving. She\u2019s allowed to yell at you for not sharing her feelings. How dare you express your own feelings! Only your mother\u2019s feelings are appropriate!\u201d?", "NTA", "NTA. You're a good dad, and your kids are lucky to have you and your support. You did nothing wrong. I hope she realises this soon and apologises to you and your kids.", "NTA.  Your wife  doesnt want her image of a happy life shattered, pretending for 7 years  works so well and now she cant and that hurts.  \n\n\nTake care and see if  you can more custody time with the kids now, when she needs healing and grieving.", "NTA: Grief is a funny thing. Even if you genuinely miss someone, you might not cry at their funeral. And you cannot force someone into performing grief. They are not undertaker's mutes.", "You wouldn't be the AH, but it was literally the day of her husband's funeral.  You could have showed more compassion and grace.", "NTA. Your wife is. Im very sorry for her loss, but her loss is hers. It isn't your kids' loss, and as you rightly said... she should be proud of them for supporting her and being extremely mature about it.", "NTA", "NTA. You're a good dad.", "NTA, I hope your ex gets help and that your kids can stay with you.", "NTA, your children don't have to put on a show, it is wrong to teach them to show/do something they don't mean or feel. Not sure how she is normally, but I would like to point out that grief could cause some people to act irrational and a bit unhinged( not an excuse to be terrible or nasty) so if she is normally a mentally healthy person and not terrible or nasty as she process her feelings  she will look back and probably will cringe about doing that with your children. If you could explain that to your children with age appropriate terms, it will help them understand why their mother was acting the way she was.", "NTA. 100% agree with you that she f should not b be making the kids pretend just for her.", "She sounds absolutely insufferable. \n\nNot sure who left who but it sounds like you won the lottery. Bravo for dodging that one.\n\nLive AHs turn into dead AHs at some point and clearly this man was nothing to your kids other than a source of misery. \n\nDespite their young age, they seemed perfectly capable of separating the notion of care and support for their mother from a lack of feeling for the man who died. And why on earth would they mourn the death of someone who was hard on them, at best, or cruel to them, at worst?\n\nYour wife's feelings for her late husband are understandable but a hearty slap on the back for you for dealing with the situation so maturely and supporting your kids in the way that you did. \n\nA resounding and very solid NTA", "I'm *extremely* hard pressed to call the woman who lost her husband of 7 years a week ago an asshole for acting a bit irrationally", "one thing is for sure, even if the kids would have grieved over their stepdead in their own way and at their own time. The mothers behaviour washed and grieve left away effectively", "Why is \u201cyelling at the grieving widow\u201d even a point, specially for the daughter, when the grieving widow is the one who initiated the conflict? Daughter does not cross into AH territory, not even maybe. Same for the husband.", "By doing what? They didn't get together and sing \"ding dong the dick is dead\", they didn't lash out until she kept pushing and I'm sorry if you don't keep in mind that this is an important day for you and that you should keep conflict out of it why should your children when you come at them sideways trying to make them feel things they don't and shaming them for it.", "The poor woman is delusional. She has this picture of a perfect husband/father in her head that simply doesn't match reality. I feel bad for the kids having to deal with that.", "she's also extra upset because she *knows* her kids did not like that man, she *knows* they were unhappy around him, but she always was able to just play the denial game and tell herself \"it's ok they will get used to him and love him with time\". Now that he's gone and her kids aren't mourning him, she has to come face to face witht he fact that not only was he not goo for their children, she made their lives so miserable by staying with him that they're actually relieved by his death and that's her fault. she failed her kids so hard by banking on this man who is now gone and she doesn't want to come face to face with all that", "NTA dude, I\u2019d get with your lawyer and seek fully custody.", "If you are knowledgeable on the subject could you share what he did that was tough?", "While I agree that she was probably acting this way because of grief, that's not the point of this particular question.  OP is asking if THEY were the asshole, and I think we all agree they weren't.", "He spoke to them like they were soldiers and he was their commanding officer. That was how he spoke to his own kids too. Barking orders at them. Also very strict on how they sat and stood (posture). Was very tough on them regarding what extra curricular activities they wanted to do. He had his own ideas of what kids should do and my son especially wasn't interested in the sport aspect and that was not what my ex's late husband liked to hear. He also didn't believe kids should be helped with homework beyond kindergarten and did not like how the kids would react to seeing me during exchanges. He believed kids should act \"civilized at all times\" and them taking off running and jumping into my arms was something he did not approve of and said it to them (though not in front of me after I told him it was what we do).", "Making it a NAH situation, life and relationships are messy and don't fit into tiny little black and white judgements oftentimes", "Good lord. Of course they hated him. I\u2019m sorry they were treated that way for seven years.", "Yup that definitely sounds annoying only one I get would be posture", "They weren't being needlessly cruel they just weren't sad (and for good reason.) This only became a conflict because mother dearest kept pushing and prodding trying to drum up some remorse for a dead asshole. Nobody did anything wrong here except the ex wife.", "So am I. I also felt bad for his kids who had no escape from being spoken to that way.", "There are ways to handle that without barking at them. It was all part of the bigger picture with him. I'm not sure if he was ex-military but he sure reminded me of that.", "The kids really do feel that way. They never liked him. They were not close to him. He was their least favorite part of their mom's house and they vented about him a lot over the 7 years they knew him. I was always there to listen and help. But they did not love or care about him one bit.", "Well hopefully as they get through the grieving process they can start to heal. Best of luck to you and the kids right now.", "No idea anyways NTA", "Yeah I just googled \u201cbad posture\u201d and then showed my 5 year old the images. Here\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t slouch kiddo and she got it.", "Thanks for replying OP. \n\nWould you mind sharing how old your kids were when your ex wife began her relationship with the stepdad? Was it very soon after your divorce?\n\nI don\u2019t think your kids are wrong for not being sad about the death, or for laughing with you at the funeral. My major disagreement was with how they expressed it to your ex wife. You seem like a really caring dad, and I hope your ex wife wakes up and apologizes to your kids for being pushy and dismissive of their feelings.\n\n I wasn\u2019t expecting this much engagement so I didn\u2019t write this in the main comment, but I do think that your wife is more TA and unreasonable than you or your kids. As you said, they\u2019re children and they\u2019re not mature adults. Your ex is responsible for her grief and feelings, and it\u2019s wrong of her to force your kids to act like something they don\u2019t feel. \n\nI also think your kids should apologize for expressing their dislike of the stepdad at the funeral, as a teaching moment of understanding that you aren\u2019t just parents but people with feelings that can be hurt.", "It was about two years after the divorce that she started dating him. She was with them for about a year when the kids met him and they married soon after. So the kids were 4 and 6 when they met him.", "How is that backtracking", "Thank you! I wasn\u2019t sure if part of the reason they didn\u2019t like him was because the timing was really short and they felt that your wife left you for him. \n\nHow are you and the kids doing now?\n\nBased on this information and the discussion in the comments, I\u2019m going to amend my comment to NTA because at the end of the day, your wife shouldn\u2019t have reacted towards your kids that way. It is wrong of her to push you and the kids, to try to force them to do a eulogy, and to be aggressive towards them because they aren\u2019t grieving how she expected.", "I get what you're saying, but she crossed a major line. They could have been sharing stories of the departed. They could have been laughing at something that step-father loved to laugh at. OP just attacked them for having feelings that could have been completely appropriate. \n\nOh, she also gave up the right to focus solely on her emotions when she had those kids. She now has to always consider her children. No matter what happens. There is absolutely reason why she shouldn't have been put in her place.", ">Oh, she also gave up the right to focus solely on her emotions when she had those kids. She now has to always consider her children. No matter what happens. There is absolutely reason why she shouldn't have been put in her place.\n\nI personally feel that\u2019s really extreme? I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t have your own feelings and have consideration for your children\u2019s needs?\n\nIdk, there are a lot of different viewpoints that I\u2019m seeing throughout this post. I agree that her children\u2019s needs should come first. I think it\u2019s understandable that she lost her shit in a moment of selfish weakness, since she was at her husband\u2019s funeral. \n\nI think that most importantly, she needs to get herself into therapy. If she doubles down at all, or dismisses her kids and OP again, then that\u2019s a problem and she\u2019s TA. What she does next will cement the future, and I hope that she wakes up and apologizes to her kids for being so unreasonable with them."]}
