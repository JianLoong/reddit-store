We came to understand very soon that the first years of her life had been dramatic. She had close to no knowledge of the world, as in she didn't know how to walk properly at 2, she knew only a few words (food and water basically) and she had a disruptive behavior. Of course she is treated by specialists and currently in therapy but her behavior is still problematic, alongside it she has very strong abandonment issues and suffers from severe PTSD. She never wants to be on her own and feels mistreated if some kind of attention isn't on her, as if we don't love her anymore.\n\nNow to the issue, my wife and I are considering adopting another child from a different country. We would like to have a second child and a sibling to her. We do know we'd need to dedicate a lot of our time to this child and that our full attention couldn't be on our daughter anymore, because just like her every adopted kid already comes with a personal story (and therefore a personal baggage).\n\nWe think this would also be beneficial to her because she'd have to understand that we do love her although we don't spend all of our time with her and that our love can be given out to another human too. \n\nI have been talking to some family and friends about it and someone pointed out we may be TA because we're not considering the trauma and shock this new situation could cause for our daughter. She might not be ready to see us welcome another kid and \"split\" the love and attention and she might relive the abandonment all over again.\n\nAfter these talks we've started thinking about this point of view and would like to have different opinions on the matter so thank you all in advance.\n\nTLDR: wife and I have a kid with heavy abandonment issues and would like to have another kid", "created_utc": 1688948164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vefox/aita_for_wanting_to_adopt_a_second_child_when_my/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My gut feeling says that this is an idea that sounds good when picturing it in your head (oh how lovely, a second child, a sibling for A, they could be the best of friends....) but the reality of it might be far different. You know your daughter has a lot of needs and always will. She might always struggle with mental health issues and might never be able to live independently. And if you add another child into the mix, their mental health issues could be just as severe, and that could drain your family emotionally, financially, and in other ways you aren't anticipating. So if it were me, knowing I had one child with a lot of needs, I wouldn't add a second. Sorry.", "YWBTA if you let your wanting another child override your existing child's needs.\n\nAlso, I highly suggest you look into the human rights scandal that is the adoption trade between South America and Europe.

Your child won't change or learn from this. It will cause further trauma and conflict. I have a kid like this not from trauma but PDA autism and her brother has had to deal with being sidelined ever since she was born. She's like a jealous lover. The moment she sees us having a pleasant or loving interaction she will attack me or my other child violently and no amount of gentle teaching or explaining or life experience has changed it. Her brother has learned to make his own needs smaller instead and it is heart breaking as a parent wanting to reach out to him and being completely dominated by the needs of the higher needs child. \nThis could absolutely backfire and not go down how you think it will. Your first adoptee isn't going to just learn like a neurotypical kid would because the trauma she went through will have physically altered her brain structure in ways that are similar to autism and affect her ability to empathise and understand others needs. Her own needs are simply too big to get past. If I was you I would not do this.", "INFO: What does the therapist say?", "> because just like her every adopted kid already comes with a personal story (and therefore a personal baggage).\n\nYTA totally for this fucked up statement.

Your daughter is 11 \u2026 I think you are highly aware of the help she needs and are great for getting her that but you can\u2019t shield her from the real world !

Your daughter may adjust, but she also might mistreat her sibling (who will also likely have their own trauma). 11 is old enough to be able to really hurt a young child, not even necessarily with violence but with words and behavior. It's not uncommon for older siblings with emotional struggles to take their big feelings out on a vulnerable younger sibling and I don't think it's a great situation to create.", "It kinda sounds like you want to fix your current child by bringing another child into your family. You can't put a child in that position, they are not a life lesson for someone else, they're a human being.\n\nYou also don't seem to understand the trauma you would put your daughter through and you definitely aren't thinking about the trauma your future child might go through if their sister hates them.\n\nYou need to talk to a professional about this.", "I won't be able to find it again but a long time ago there was a post by a couple that will be you in the future if you choose to do this now. They adopted a severely traumatized child thinking that they weren't able to have kids. They had a little miracle some years later, and kept having kids. Their adopted child (unsurprisingly) became more and more unstable, upset, and violent with herself and others. Then started openly threatening and being violent towards everyone in the house. The parents were debating on whether they should rehome, institutionalize, or do something else for their adopted child. Many of the comments pointed out how selfish it was to have more kids knowing it would only retraumatize and escalate the issues that they barely were able to deal with in the first kid. The parents kind of shrugged because they got their miracle, so they were concerned with protecting \"their child\" of the adopted one.\n\nPlease do not make this decision lightly, and do not take unnecessary risks. You chose to commit to this child, so you need to commit to this child just like you would a child you conceived biologically. Imho, YTA for even considering this right now.", "YTA, you can't bring a second child into that environment. Both children will suffer.", "Maybe focus on the kid you now have instead of getting another brand new one in to somehow magically \u2018fix\u2019 the problems that already exist.\n\nA new child seems like it would exacerbate this current situation, not resolve it \n\nNAH", "YWBTA and incredibly selfish for bringing another child into a potentially toxic environment. And why on earth are you asking Reddit before you\u2019ve even spoken with a specialized therapist about adding in another kid??", "My personal opinion here is this is a psychological issue, will she benefit or will she suffer depends on what her clinical condition is at present. It is like u get a diagnosis and prescription. Don't decide this on opinion on reddit. Speak with her therapist and then decide .", "We haven't spoken about it to the therapist yet, we will next time we see her", "She often changes her opinion about it but ultimately she gets really jealous if we show affection towards other children", "Maybe he heard the advice that you adopt two kittens at once bc they entertain and teach other socialization skills, including themat biting hurts and don't do it so he thought that it would transfer to actual children?", "My only regret is that I only have one upvote to give. And I'm not giving reddit money. Its going to really fuck with a child being saved from the system and end up playing second fiddle in the family", "Glad I'm not the only person who thinks this. It's also a little odd that they mention how adopting another child could be a good learning experience for their daughter, instead of something wildly traumatizing and confusing (as any major family shift could potentially be to an 11yr old child). Something about this post has a very unsettling saviorhood flavor.", "Or could just be to show what other issues the kid could have. If they\u2019re from a foreign country, they\u2019re likely to have even more issues with adjusting. Not only has she gotten a new family. She has an entirely new culture.", "I totally disagree. I think \u201cbaggage\u201d is an AH way of putting it but adopted children do tend to have more mental health issues and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to recognize that. \n\nI\u2019m an adoptee and I sincerely wish my parents would\u2019ve done more to address the issues that arose from the abandonment trauma I had, but I think the recommendation used to be to ignore that and focus on bonding as much as possible lol? Imo it\u2019s good that more adoptive parents are keeping potential issues in mind.", "Do nothing until you get that input. That insight matters more than any randos on the internet.", "Does this therapist specialize in Reactive Attachment Disorder/RAD (which is a US diagnosis, not sure what the European equivalent is) because that's what your daughter needs. She likely was not given love and affection during the first few years of her life and that trauma will always be with her. It needs to be properly addressed and she needs to be given a safe place to work through it. It's possible an adopted sibling could be helpful for her. Or, it could be extremely detrimental. I don't know your child, but her therapist does and outside of your spouse, that is the opinion that's going to matter the most. \n\nPerhaps you could try doing respite care? I'm not sure if other countries have it, but it's where you become certified to take in foster kids for a short and set amount of time. That could ease her into the idea of another child in your home or show that she's not ready.", "It's pretty odd to consider what randos who don't know your family and have zero qualifications think when you haven't even asked an expert how this will affect your daughter.", "And you think bringing in another traumatized child into that would be a good idea?", "I'm not seeing how this would be a good situation for her *or* the second child.", ">she gets really jealous if we show affection towards other children\n\nJust so we're clear, you think that would be a **GOOD** situation to put her and another child in?", "...and you are ignoring that red flag because why?", "????

This child needs a specialist.  \n\nAs for the second paragraph, I wouldn't bring a foster child with her own needs and problems into a household that already has a child with such severe emotional and behavioral issues, and who might react to the new child with hostility or just plain melt down.", "This is important info but I just want to point out that RAD is not the same as attachment disorder. A child can be attachment disordered without RAD. So OP should make sure that the clinician has experience with attachment issues generally if the daughter doesn\u2019t have the RAD diagnosis/equivalent.", "they shouldn\u2019t but their daughter will never survive being this dependent on them. she\u2019ll never be able to have a relationship or friendship cause they second they show attention to someone else she\u2019s freaking out. i\u2019m not trying to sound rude but it\u2019s not healthy", "Because they want a \"better\" child,  one who isn't so difficult and needy.", "I'm glad you got that I was half serious and half snarking.", "Fair. I should have been more specific. Respite would be a good start under the guidance of the aforementioned specialist.", "No one thinks it\u2019s healthy.
