{"id": 17515, "submission_id": "13kcbg2", "title": "AITA for calling out my \"self made serial entrepreneur\" roommate when his parents still pay his rent", "selftext": "My roommate (we're both in our late 20s) calls himself a \"serial entrepreneur\" and describes his successes as \"self made\" to anyone who will listen. Which means he makes his money club promoting, investing in meme-stocks, crypto, and (most annoyingly) doing a lifestyle-finance-self-help coaching podcast. I don't know what happened, but about a year ago he didn't pay his portion of the rent, I went to him and he said he needed some time. A week later a bank transfer came, and I could see it was from his parents. I honestly did not care, because every month since a transfer comes into my bank account for his portion of the rent.\r  \n\r  \nWe don't normally hang out, but this past weekend was his birthday and he invited me to come out with him and his \"boys\". Clubbing is not my usual scene, but a girl I've been getting close to at work has mentioned she enjoys going out dancing. We've had flirty vibes, but I've been taking it slow to dodge any sort of misunderstanding or have it backfire at work. So given the opportunity, I accepted, invited her, and said I'd be bringing a \"friend.\"\r  \n\r  \nFor most of the night, I was actually having a great time. Mostly because things with me and the girl were going really well, definitely seemed like she was into me as well too. That all ended when my drunk roommate noticed the girl I was with, and started aggressively hitting on her with me standing right next to them.\r  \n\r  \nI will admit I was threatened and jealous because he's definitely good looking and dresses very flashy and in all designer everything. And to be fair, I don't know if she was just being polite or actually into him as well. But I was also a bit tipsy, and was getting tired of him flexing about how he's thinking about buying either the new BMW XMZ or the Mercedes Benz E9000 or whatever.\r  \n\r  \nWhen he walked away, I mentioned to her that he's all talk and made fun of the fact that his parents have been paying for his rent even though he has this podcast where he pretends like he's a millionaire. I guess it was I was speaking louder than I thought, and some of his friends overheard and later that night began teasing him about it. He blew up and began to shout at me, said he'd sue me for defamation, etc, etc, etc. Security actually came over to tell us to calm down, and he actually told security to throw me out because he knew the club owner. It was a nightmare, I ended up taking that opportunity to leave with my friend who quickly grabbed a cab home.\r  \n\r  \nHe didn't come home that night or next, and then texted me that he's moving out. He cursed me out a bunch over text and said that I shouldn't talk about his business because I have no idea what his business model is, etc, etc, etc.\r  \n\r  \nThings with my co-worker have gone stale, and we're friendly but I don't know how to read the situation.

Better his money club buddies find out he's full of shit now rather than after they get suckered into investing.", "I would usually say other people\u2019s finances are their own private business, but if he\u2019s constantly bragging about money all the time, he\u2019s making it everyone\u2019s business.

Win-win. Good luck finding a new roommate.", "Info: did their parents paid for 1 month rent or been paying rent for a while?", "NTA. Your former roommate was a thin-skinned, spoiled d-bag. Seriously, he tried to get you thrown out of a club being pretending to know the owner.\n\nYou called him out on his life of lies. If he didn't want to be exposed as a liar, he shouldn't have been lying in the first place. \n\nYou gave an AH a righteous smackdown, and you should be glad to have him out of your life.", "ESH, just a bit: OP, it sounds like you were both fairly loaded. Your roommate was hitting on your date. Bad decision. His friends overheard your comments, also bad decision. Now you have no roommate & your date is no longer interested. This is not the outcome you wanted. Oops. Unintended Consequences!", "Eh ESH\n\nYou could've called him out directly, instead you talked about him behind his back.", "ESH\n\nBut I legit understand what you did and I would do it too.\n\nIt reminds me of a meme, I can't quite remember it but it was something like\n\nHow to retire by 35:\n\n1. Spend frugally\n\n2. Invest wisely\n\n3. Inherit trust fund\n\n4. Profit!", "I mean yeah yta.... But I get where you're coming from.  You exposed his lies.", "100% YTA, but with that said, I\u2019m all for it in this scenario.", "YTA - but righteously so.", "NTA. He wanted to lie to gain something around people who knows its bull shit. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "Lol NTA! To use a phrase from the late 1900's...what a poser.", "YTA. I think you should have just left it at \"he's all talk\". I get your anger and jealously but your lack self awareness caused this.", "ESH.\n\n1. Housemate is a total scam. So obviously, AH.\n\n2. I doubt he can sue you for a petty remark while drunk in a club, and I feel like that was going to come out eventually so you're a little bit of an AH for that but he kinda had it coming.  HOWEVER\n\n3. With respect to the coworker, it was really bad form to humiliate him, however truthfully.\n\na) You probably don't think humiliation is inherently a good thing, but you tried to use it to impress her as if you thought it was. Also kind of an insult to her character for Drunk You even thought this would impress her. So that's an ick.\n\nb) If you asked if he was bothering you, that would be a way of showing that you're competing with him for her feelings. Humiliating him made it seem like you were competing with him for your ego and she was just the prize. So that's another ick.\n\nSo you were actually quite an AH to your coworker.\n\nPart of me would chalk it up to the alcohol, but consider that alcohol mainly removes inhibitions. The drunk that tells you about the aliens still believes in them when he's sober, he's just too embarrassed. The drunk that hits his wife still wants to be violent when sober, he just remembers what the consequences are.", "YTA because you were saying it to get revenge, not in a purely factual way to inform somebody about something. I'm not saying you did anything someone else wouldn't also do, because people aren't 100% nice all the time, I'm just saying this wasn't very nice and you didn't have to make fun of him to someone he just met. Even if you find him obnoxious, you don't have to stoop to his level. You didn't commit a mortal sin, but maybe text him sorry.", "(sigh)... Well you've already admitted to feeling \"threatened and jealous\", so I'll leave what I was gonna say about that alone.... Hater \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\n\nBut forreal, you really shouldn't have put out his business like that, you didn't even know if the girl was buying into it. Even if she did, dude just take your L and let her take her potential L and move on lol I'll say a soft YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
