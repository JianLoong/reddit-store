WOW", "NTA\n\nIf he's not going to be reliable about responding, then he's not an appropriate person to call in an emergency.  If he has a problem with that, he has a really easy solution... ANSWER HIS PHONE!\n\nBesides, it's not like you can't call him after you call one of your friends who will actually pick up and help.\n\nAnd the therapist is an idiot... their advice should be that his refusal to communicate is damaging your relationship and he should quit being so selfish and just respond, even if it's just sending a quick text saying that he is busy and will call later... it's not that hard!", "His therapist sees everything from his pov.

Even if he is that dumb that he doesn't realise that calling multiple times indicates a very urgent situation, he should know after you told him.\n\nHe is an elder of course, but not that old. Way to old for you though. The is no way about it, he went after a teen as a 40 year old, he is an absolute creep.", "NTA - I would be mortified and ashamed to learn if I found out that my partner viewed me as unreliable in emergencies and work to fix that immediately.", "NTA.\n\nI understand your husband is older but this isn\u2019t a generational thing. This is a husband thing.\n\nYour husband is someone who has repeatedly missed vital calls from you and doesn\u2019t care. Did he even apologize for not getting back to you? For ignoring you when you thought your baby was in danger because he was with a friend?\n\nEveryone has times when they miss or don\u2019t answer phone calls. The difference is that most people who care about someone else try and reduce the chances of that happening.\n\nThis sounds like it may be small part of a bigger picture. Think about it this is part of a pattern of careless or dismissive behavior.", "NTA.\n\nMy mom is frankly similar -- she's not good with the cellphone and I worry that in emergencies she won't use it, doesn't keep it on her, keep it charged etc. It causes a lot of stress in my family.\n\nIt's clear that even in EMERGENCIES your husband isn't that reliable with the phone. You're totally well within your right to make other arrangements. I wonder if this isn't somewhat a generational thing -- he would not have \"come of age\" with cellphones until well into his working years. That said, it's always a good idea to have a multi-level support system with other family and friends, just in case. I don't know if telling your partner was the right call -- seems like it's going to cause hurt feelings no matter how well intended, with no change in outcome for you -- but that's your choice.\n\nAlso, therapists often tell their clients what they want to hear, so I wouldn't put too much stock in what your DH's therapist says.", "NTA.  He is being rude and dismissive.  I would certainly set up someone else to be your emergency contact person.  (Maybe some tall handsome man closer to your age and really buff?) And if your husband doesn't like it, he can learn to answer his phone.", "Definitely NTA. You should call your husband but if he doesn\u2019t pick up, pick someone else who you trust to pick up their phone.", "NTA - his therapist is on his side, I bet if you had one they'd be on yours. If he wants to be your emergency contact he needs to be more reliable.", "NTA\n\nMy mom keeps her cellphone in her purse mainly for emergencies but she does keep it charged.

You need a reliable contact for your own safety.", "I totally feel this.  My partner is never available when there is an emergency.  He doesn\u2019t answer the phone.

My sister is now my emergency contact.", "NTA and i bet he's not telling his therapist that he ignores you even when you've made a dozen calls and texts, that it happens in emergencies, and he's being willfully unhelpful in situations he should be available for", "I feel you!  My DH often leaves his phone sitting when he is at home because he doesn't like to keep it in his pocket and since we don't have a home phone I can call and call and not get a response.  Drives me crazy.  Thankfully he has never purposefully ignored my calls.  I would be furious.  \n\nNTA", "NTA - Tell him if he doesn\u2019t like it he can start answering his phone. He seems totally dismissive of you & your kids going by your other comments. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t believe the excuses he gave either, if anyone I knew (partner, family or friend) called me repeatedly I would answer no matter who I was at lunch with. \n\nHe\u2019s only 62 not 92, he knows how to use a mobile. My mum struggled with texting but she could make and take calls no problem.", "Key word is HIS....HIS therapist. She only hears what he tells her. He is unreliable...plain and simple.

I'm sorry your husband isn't reliable", "NTA, he\u2019s shown you multiple times he\u2019s unreliable. When he saw you calling him at a casual lunch multiple times, he felt no sense of urgency whatsoever and just kept letting it ring which is super weird. Most people would realize back to back calls meant there was an emergency.", "NTA  My husband his HORRIBLE about answering his phone.  It's usually stuff like i'm stopping for food and does he want any?  But I always \"joke\" that i'm going to call someone else in case of an emergency because I can't trust he'll see the calls.  If i'm at work and he and my daughter are at home, i'll usually text her if it's something I need an answer on quickly.  I don't blame you.", "Nta- willing to bet money his therapist didn\u2019t say that, or he told his therapist, that you just call him all the time, not giving me incidents that you gave us", "NTA but you\u2019re about his age when he started dating you. Would you date a teenager at your age? No? \n\nThen I think you can see why he did. He doesn\u2019t want to be held accountable as a partner, that\u2019s clear as day. That\u2019s why he dated a teenager when he was 40.", "NTA. My boyfriend is the first person I call in an emergency and vice versa, regardless of the situation. Your husband is your partner for a reason and he\u2019s not showing up, of course you would pick to go to someone else", "NTA. My mum is my emergency contact not my partner, for the same reason! The guy is always taking a shit I swear lol.", "NTA, my sister is my emergency contact for this reason", "NTA. He isn't reliable. Why would you call him in an emergency if you never know if he will even answer the phone?", "NTA\n\nRemember, HE described your thoughts and feelings to his therapist so who knows how accurately he did that. And HIS therapist\u2019s job is in part to validate his feelings.\n\nNo one should be carrying home their therapist\u2019s opinion to submit into a relationship dispute as if it is evidence.", "NTA.  He *isn\u2019t* reliable.  What you\u2019re asking for is entirely reasonable.  And frankly, I\u2019d be a bit suspicious of *why* he has such a habit of being unreachable.", "It\u2019s probably because he has his ringer set to on his cricket phone and can\u2019t hear it over the slot machines. Unless your emergency is around 4pm he\u2019s not going to hear it, that\u2019s when he steps out for an early bird special at the MCL", "NTA if someone calls me repeatedly I'm guessing it's important. Your husband is an AH.", "Ask him what part his therapist thinks you're being unreasonable about.", "NTA\n\nMy bf and I do this thing where if we miss a call from each other bc we're in a meeting (we both work office jobs) or are otherwise busy, we immediately text \"doing xyz, is this urgent?\" \n\n99% of the time it's not, just something funny or interesting and we like to hear the reaction rather than text. We'll reply \"something funny, will take 5 minutes when you're free\" or similar. \n\nThe 1% we reply back, \"need you now\" and the rebound time between sending that text and a call back is about 5s. \n\nIf we abused this privilege (and I do NOT think you are) then we would lose trust and our communication would break down but so far so good. \n\nYou need to be able to rely on your partner and even more so, your kids need to rely on their father. He's failing everyone in his immediate family rn.", "Guess your response to his statement that you are wrong and unreasonable is:  Hmmm, you repeatedly don\u2019t answer the phone when I call, and you readily admit that my calls are not a priority.   If MY calls are not a priority, I can only presume that an unknown number would be even less of a priority.  If I have an emergency, I am going to call someone reliable that I can count on to help.  Not call the person who regularly and happily admits won\u2019t respond.  If his therapist agrees with him I guarantee the therapist got an entirely different story.", "So, while I can totally understand your viewpoint, I probably wouldn't have *told* my husband that.  For emergencies I would probably call him once so it registers as I reached out and then call my ACTUAL emergency person.  But yeah, I probably wouldn't have told him that even though you're not wrong.", "NTA. He has shown he\u2019s unreliable.", "NTA. A couple years ago I had an accident at work and they called my mom as my case of emergency and she never picked up they called quite a few times and nothing I had to go to the hospital so my co worker came with me and while unconscious they asked her questions she couldn\u2019t answer. My mom finally found out later and when I asked why she didn\u2019t answer she said she put her phone on silent and forgot about it. Last year after numerous instances of this i put my aunt as my in case of emergency so when I ended up in the hospital again they called her instead and she came she answered all the questions made all the decisions and she called my mom like 40 times. When my mom finally showed up she was unapologetic again and asked my aunt how she got here if I was unconscious the doctor came out and was talking to my aunt and my mum was like excuse me she\u2019s  my daughter not hers but the doctor told her I listed her. My mom confronted me about it when I came to and I just straight up told her that if the doctors have to wait for her to answer her damn phone and drag her ass here I\u2019d be dead so I put someone who answers their phone instead. She was bitter about it but she knows it\u2019s true.", "NTA. Leaving your phone in another room is excusable; ignoring repeated calls from your partner on purpose isn't OK. I understand not wanting to be rude, but in that situation you'd surely make your apologies and step away from the table for a second.", ">but after hearing his therapist thinks it's unreasonable as well\n\nQuestion: did you hear this directly out of his therapist's mouth, or did he tell you this himself?", "A 40 year old man went after an 18 year old girl. And he doesn\u2019t even respect her enough to check his messages when she calls a half dozen times while she\u2019s pregnant?!", "INFO - you included examples when you couldn\u2019t get a hold of him. When did these examples occur? Have there been situations where you were able to get ahold of him? Basically what I\u2019m trying to know is, are these one offs over a long period of time and otherwise he\u2019s gotten better over time. One of the examples you mentioned said it was back when texting costs extra. That sounds like a really long time ago.", "NAH\n\nBecause many baby boomers treat cell phones differently than younger generations and grew up in a time where being reachable 24/7 was unheard of. My parents regularly put their phones on silent or leave them at home when they go somewhere, even for extended periods of time. This is a normal and common thing for people of that age group. Not answering phone calls while having dinner with people is also very common for that generation.\n\nAlso, not having your insurance information with you when you drive is your mistake alone.\n\nAnd a 40 year old guy marrying a 20 year old woman is more than a little creepy", "I'm not going to call you an AH, but you cited two incidents in 22 years.  I can't see that makes him particularly unreliable.", "NAH he is unreliable if you say he doesn't pick up his phone when you call but those examples don't really put him in the wrong either", "Are you sure any friend you call would answer their phone repeatedly, like, you know for a fact they won\u2019t be asleep or have left their phone somewhere?", "So here's the thing about cellphones. There's no way of indicating, at the time that you place the call, \"this is an actual emergency - I need you to answer\" vs \"I just wanted a chat\". And it's also true that people are often away from their phones - either because it ran out of battery and is charging, or is in another room or something.\n\nYou seem to be starting with the assumption that everyone should be surgically attached to their phone at all times. Speaking personally, several of the buildings I routinely work in don't have cell reception inside the building. So if I'm in there, you could call as often as you like, and I won't get the call. Or maybe it's charging, and I've gone to the bathroom or something.\n\nRe your second example, you were driving. It's your responsibility to have the insurance information in your car. Your insurance company probably mails you a card to keep in your car, and if for whatever reason you haven't yet put the new card in your car, you'd at least have the expired one, and you probably didn't change insurance so it's the same information.\n\nIf they don't mail you a physical card, you should print one and put it in your car. The great thing about a piece of paper is that it can't run out of battery, and you can't forget the login details for it.\n\nIt sounds like rather than just assuming that your husband \"should be aware\" that if you call multiple times, it's an emergency, you should tell him that if you just want a chat, you'll call once, and if it's a real \"drop what you're doing because I need help now\" emergency, then you'll call repeatedly. That's a reasonable arrangement to have, but it's not necessarily obvious.\n\nSo what do I think?\n\nI think your car example is entirely self-inflicted. It was an \"emergency\" generated entirely by your failure to carry a paper copy of your insurance details, plus your failure to know your login details for your insurance app. I think you're over-reliant on your cellphone to bail you out of any difficulties you happen to encounter, and that you need to be a bit more self-reliant. And I think there's a whole bunch of reasons why people might not answer their phone.\n\nThat said, if my wife called me repeatedly while I was having lunch with a friend, I would certainly have answered, and so would everyone I know. If she just called once, I'd probably excuse myself, answer, and say something like \"I'm in the middle of something - is this an emergency or can I call you back later?\"\n\nSo I think you're both at fault here, so I'm voting ESH.", "What is His Job? Where Does He Work? Until then YATA.", "ESH\n\nYou said you call him just to tell him stories about the kids etc but ALSO in emergencies - how is he going to know? \n\nObv in the repeated call incident during lunch, he was at fault there - but I don't think OVERALL not always having your phone on you makes you unreliable. Not reaching someone the INSTANT you want to isn't what makes someone reliable. It makes them reliably REACHABLE but that doesn't always mean they are a reliable person. \n\nThey are simply consistent with their communication preferences. (ie always attached) \n\nNow - in the case where you were pregnant - that obv should be a diff situation. If heavily pregnant, his phone should be on him at all times. \n\nLastly - you might look to see if there is an app or a ringtone you can set up to indicate it is important.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Everyone is really glossing over the fact that she was 19 and he was 40 when they got together. That man needs to take several long, hard looks in the mirror if he doesn't think he's the problem.", "This one. She\u2019s permanently 19 in his mind thus a kid and he treats her like one. Not reliable, not a good partner, not a great person. Sounds like repeated excuses and zero accountability.", "A 40 year old with a 19 year old.

Or why he lied to his therapist.", "That was my first thought. His therapist is giving advice to on what op claims is the truth. The therapist has no way of knowing its its accurate or not.", "The pregnancy example was in the early 2000s, before texting became unlimited, so he asked us to avoid texting until after the certain hours our carrier gave for unlimited messaging. \n\nAnd the second was literally last summer. \n\nHe has always been this way no matter what I say. If he's on the phone with someone else, just talking about guitars (his hobby), he'll ignore my calls. He's also this way with our children. So as a result, our children call me first when they need something. The kids schools always call me because they can never reach him, even when he was working from home, running his own business, which he did for the entire time we've been together until Covid shut down everything and killed his business. \n\nI've always worked in offices, outside of the home, with an actual schedule that I was held to, while he owned his own business and was the only employee and could have absolutely been available to deal with school issues, but he wouldn't answer his phone. So the schools would call me and I'd either have to track him down, or more often than not, leave my job to go deal with the situation at school. \n\nIt's been a constant thing. I just gave two examples, fairly far apart in the timeline of our relationship.", "19.

He picks up when I call (I'm the text instead of call generation though) and responds to texts quickly.\n\nWhy? Because I matter to him. I return the behavior: I respond when he calls or texts. If I'm at a social event or in a meeting I will text to let him know I'll call him back soon. If he called me several times in a row I would drop everything and get in touch because I would know that something was wrong. We don't even have kids in the house: I would make his life a living hell if he routinely didn't pick up the phone when there was an urgent kid matter as OP notes in her comments. \n\nI'm glad OP has decided to have a different support system for emergencies but worry that her husband shows a lack of concern for her well being as well as his childrens.", "One extremely high stakes situation where she is heavily pregnant and could of miscarried where he saw her call over and over and didn\u2019t answer because of a lunch date with a friend. That would permanently make him not my first call. Let alone the subsequent incidents even if they are lower stakes. If he doesn\u2019t want to prioritize calls from her that\u2019s his prerogative, but he can\u2019t turn around and be hurt when he\u2019s not given infinite chances to let her down in a crisis.", "A six month pregnant wife, calling repeatedly (**especially when she only does so in emergencies,**) being ignored makes him TA even if he was in the most important meeting of his career.   Ignoring her because he was at lunch with a friend and didn't want to be rude? \n\nThat tells us exactly where his wife stands in his hierarchy of importance, and it's definitely not where a spouse *should* be.", "So far, yes. The one friend I\u2019m thinking of making my emergency contact answers the phone every time I call.", "Maybe you missed the part where I said I was in HIS car, which means that by your rules it should be HIS responsibility to have his insurance information in there...and that I had the app but the login had expired. \n\nAs to the \"assumption\" that I think he should just be aware that any time I call repeatedly it's an emergency YES. I do think that because we have discussed exactly that. I've been very clear with him, \"If it's just for a quick chat, I'll call and if you don't answer I'll text and you can call me back whenever. But if I'm calling repeatedly, it's an emergency.\" I'm not sure how that makes me unreasonable. \n\nI also know that he has no issues with cell service at his place of work, because he's called me multiple times, from multiple different places within the warehouse he works in and has never had a problem. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I appreciate your input.", ">There's no way of indicating, at the time that you place the call, \"this is an actual emergency - I need you to answer\" vs \"I just wanted a chat\".\n\nYes there is. If I want to chat I'll call one time, and wait for you to call back. If I call three times in a row it's an emergency. It's not hard.", ">So here's the thing about cellphones. There's no way of indicating, at the time that you place the call, \"this is an actual emergency - I need you to answer\" vs \"I just wanted a chat\". And it's also true that people are often away from their phones - either because it ran out of battery and is charging, or is in another room or something.\n\nPersonally for the people important to me I have a plan to tell them the call is an emergency and they have a plan to tell me a call is an emergency.\n\nThe easiest way is to reserve an app with a built in voip program as an emergency line. So for example any phone calls through Instagrams phone service is an emergency call.\n\nThey don't have a plan and that's on them but there are ways to signify that a call is an emergency.", "What does this have to do with anything? The first example he was eating lunch with a friend and the 2nd he was in the bathroom. Neither involved his job.", "The difference is that if it's just a silly story, she'll call him once and then not mind if he doesn't answer or call back. But if someone calls you multiple times in short succession, then it's usually something important.", "I think you may have misunderstood what I mean...so allow me to clarify. \n\nI do call him occasionally (and he does the same) during a work day, usually during a time when I know he'd usually be taking a break, to tell him something funny, or ask a question I need an answer to but that isn't an emergency. I'd say, on average, I do this once a week. If he doesn't answer this kind of call, I'll either text him the story/question/whatever or I'll text him and ask him to call when he can. This kind of call is not what upsets me.\n\nWhat upsets me is that he KNOWS that I won't repeatedly call unless there's an emergency, because I do understand he may be busy or not have his phone with him. But if I've been calling for 45 minutes after being in a car accident or have fallen down the stairs, surely at some point in that 45 minutes he'd been near his phone.", "The phone can't tell the difference between an emergency or non emergency.

Both also put their phones on silent when they meet with friends or go out for dinner.
