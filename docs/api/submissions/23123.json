WOW", "NTA\n\nIf he's not going to be reliable about responding, then he's not an appropriate person to call in an emergency.  If he has a problem with that, he has a really easy solution... ANSWER HIS PHONE!\n\nBesides, it's not like you can't call him after you call one of your friends who will actually pick up and help.\n\nAnd the therapist is an idiot... their advice should be that his refusal to communicate is damaging your relationship and he should quit being so selfish and just respond, even if it's just sending a quick text saying that he is busy and will call later... it's not that hard!", "His therapist sees everything from his pov.

Even if he is that dumb that he doesn't realise that calling multiple times indicates a very urgent situation, he should know after you told him.\n\nHe is an elder of course, but not that old. Way to old for you though. The is no way about it, he went after a teen as a 40 year old, he is an absolute creep.", "NTA - I would be mortified and ashamed to learn if I found out that my partner viewed me as unreliable in emergencies and work to fix that immediately.", "NTA.\n\nI understand your husband is older but this isn\u2019t a generational thing. This is a husband thing.\n\nYour husband is someone who has repeatedly missed vital calls from you and doesn\u2019t care. Did he even apologize for not getting back to you? For ignoring you when you thought your baby was in danger because he was with a friend?\n\nEveryone has times when they miss or don\u2019t answer phone calls. The difference is that most people who care about someone else try and reduce the chances of that happening.\n\nThis sounds like it may be small part of a bigger picture. Think about it this is part of a pattern of careless or dismissive behavior.", "NTA.\n\nMy mom is frankly similar -- she's not good with the cellphone and I worry that in emergencies she won't use it, doesn't keep it on her, keep it charged etc. It causes a lot of stress in my family.\n\nIt's clear that even in EMERGENCIES your husband isn't that reliable with the phone. You're totally well within your right to make other arrangements. I wonder if this isn't somewhat a generational thing -- he would not have \"come of age\" with cellphones until well into his working years. That said, it's always a good idea to have a multi-level support system with other family and friends, just in case. I don't know if telling your partner was the right call -- seems like it's going to cause hurt feelings no matter how well intended, with no change in outcome for you -- but that's your choice.\n\nAlso, therapists often tell their clients what they want to hear, so I wouldn't put too much stock in what your DH's therapist says.", "NTA.  He is being rude and dismissive.  I would certainly set up someone else to be your emergency contact person.  (Maybe some tall handsome man closer to your age and really buff?) And if your husband doesn't like it, he can learn to answer his phone.", "Definitely NTA. You should call your husband but if he doesn\u2019t pick up, pick someone else who you trust to pick up their phone.", "NTA - his therapist is on his side, I bet if you had one they'd be on yours. If he wants to be your emergency contact he needs to be more reliable.", "NTA\n\nMy mom keeps her cellphone in her purse mainly for emergencies but she does keep it charged.

You need a reliable contact for your own safety.", "I totally feel this.  My partner is never available when there is an emergency.  He doesn\u2019t answer the phone.

My sister is now my emergency contact.", "NTA and i bet he's not telling his therapist that he ignores you even when you've made a dozen calls and texts, that it happens in emergencies, and he's being willfully unhelpful in situations he should be available for", "I feel you!  My DH often leaves his phone sitting when he is at home because he doesn't like to keep it in his pocket and since we don't have a home phone I can call and call and not get a response.  Drives me crazy.  Thankfully he has never purposefully ignored my calls.  I would be furious.  \n\nNTA", "NTA - Tell him if he doesn\u2019t like it he can start answering his phone. He seems totally dismissive of you & your kids going by your other comments. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t believe the excuses he gave either, if anyone I knew (partner, family or friend) called me repeatedly I would answer no matter who I was at lunch with. \n\nHe\u2019s only 62 not 92, he knows how to use a mobile. My mum struggled with texting but she could make and take calls no problem.", "Key word is HIS....HIS therapist. She only hears what he tells her. He is unreliable...plain and simple.

I'm sorry your husband isn't reliable", "NTA, he\u2019s shown you multiple times he\u2019s unreliable. When he saw you calling him at a casual lunch multiple times, he felt no sense of urgency whatsoever and just kept letting it ring which is super weird. Most people would realize back to back calls meant there was an emergency.", "NTA  My husband his HORRIBLE about answering his phone.  It's usually stuff like i'm stopping for food and does he want any?  But I always \"joke\" that i'm going to call someone else in case of an emergency because I can't trust he'll see the calls.  If i'm at work and he and my daughter are at home, i'll usually text her if it's something I need an answer on quickly.  I don't blame you.", "Nta- willing to bet money his therapist didn\u2019t say that, or he told his therapist, that you just call him all the time, not giving me incidents that you gave us", "NTA but you\u2019re about his age when he started dating you. Would you date a teenager at your age? No? \n\nThen I think you can see why he did. He doesn\u2019t want to be held accountable as a partner, that\u2019s clear as day. That\u2019s why he dated a teenager when he was 40.", "NTA. My boyfriend is the first person I call in an emergency and vice versa, regardless of the situation. Your husband is your partner for a reason and he\u2019s not showing up, of course you would pick to go to someone else", "NTA. My mum is my emergency contact not my partner, for the same reason! The guy is always taking a shit I swear lol.", "NTA, my sister is my emergency contact for this reason", "NTA. He isn't reliable. Why would you call him in an emergency if you never know if he will even answer the phone?", "NTA\n\nRemember, HE described your thoughts and feelings to his therapist so who knows how accurately he did that. And HIS therapist\u2019s job is in part to validate his feelings.\n\nNo one should be carrying home their therapist\u2019s opinion to submit into a relationship dispute as if it is evidence.", "NTA.  He *isn\u2019t* reliable.  What you\u2019re asking for is entirely reasonable.  And frankly, I\u2019d be a bit suspicious of *why* he has such a habit of being unreachable.", "It\u2019s probably because he has his ringer set to on his cricket phone and can\u2019t hear it over the slot machines. Unless your emergency is around 4pm he\u2019s not going to hear it, that\u2019s when he steps out for an early bird special at the MCL", "NTA if someone calls me repeatedly I'm guessing it's important. Your husband is an AH.", "Ask him what part his therapist thinks you're being unreasonable about.", "NTA\n\nMy bf and I do this thing where if we miss a call from each other bc we're in a meeting (we both work office jobs) or are otherwise busy, we immediately text \"doing xyz, is this urgent?\" \n\n99% of the time it's not, just something funny or interesting and we like to hear the reaction rather than text. We'll reply \"something funny, will take 5 minutes when you're free\" or similar. \n\nThe 1% we reply back, \"need you now\" and the rebound time between sending that text and a call back is about 5s. \n\nIf we abused this privilege (and I do NOT think you are) then we would lose trust and our communication would break down but so far so good. \n\nYou need to be able to rely on your partner and even more so, your kids need to rely on their father. He's failing everyone in his immediate family rn.", "Guess your response to his statement that you are wrong and unreasonable is:  Hmmm, you repeatedly don\u2019t answer the phone when I call, and you readily admit that my calls are not a priority.   If MY calls are not a priority, I can only presume that an unknown number would be even less of a priority.  If I have an emergency, I am going to call someone reliable that I can count on to help.  Not call the person who regularly and happily admits won\u2019t respond.  If his therapist agrees with him I guarantee the therapist got an entirely different story.", "So, while I can totally understand your viewpoint, I probably wouldn't have *told* my husband that.  For emergencies I would probably call him once so it registers as I reached out and then call my ACTUAL emergency person.  But yeah, I probably wouldn't have told him that even though you're not wrong.", "NTA. He has shown he\u2019s unreliable.", "NTA. A couple years ago I had an accident at work and they called my mom as my case of emergency and she never picked up they called quite a few times and nothing I had to go to the hospital so my co worker came with me and while unconscious they asked her questions she couldn\u2019t answer. My mom finally found out later and when I asked why she didn\u2019t answer she said she put her phone on silent and forgot about it. Last year after numerous instances of this i put my aunt as my in case of emergency so when I ended up in the hospital again they called her instead and she came she answered all the questions made all the decisions and she called my mom like 40 times. When my mom finally showed up she was unapologetic again and asked my aunt how she got here if I was unconscious the doctor came out and was talking to my aunt and my mum was like excuse me she\u2019s  my daughter not hers but the doctor told her I listed her. My mom confronted me about it when I came to and I just straight up told her that if the doctors have to wait for her to answer her damn phone and drag her ass here I\u2019d be dead so I put someone who answers their phone instead. She was bitter about it but she knows it\u2019s true.", "NTA. Leaving your phone in another room is excusable; ignoring repeated calls from your partner on purpose isn't OK. I understand not wanting to be rude, but in that situation you'd surely make your apologies and step away from the table for a second.", ">but after hearing his therapist thinks it's unreasonable as well\n\nQuestion: did you hear this directly out of his therapist's mouth, or did he tell you this himself?", "A 40 year old man went after an 18 year old girl. And he doesn\u2019t even respect her enough to check his messages when she calls a half dozen times while she\u2019s pregnant?!", "INFO - you included examples when you couldn\u2019t get a hold of him. When did these examples occur? Have there been situations where you were able to get ahold of him? Basically what I\u2019m trying to know is, are these one offs over a long period of time and otherwise he\u2019s gotten better over time. One of the examples you mentioned said it was back when texting costs extra. That sounds like a really long time ago.", "NAH\n\nBecause many baby boomers treat cell phones differently than younger generations and grew up in a time where being reachable 24/7 was unheard of. My parents regularly put their phones on silent or leave them at home when they go somewhere, even for extended periods of time. This is a normal and common thing for people of that age group. Not answering phone calls while having dinner with people is also very common for that generation.\n\nAlso, not having your insurance information with you when you drive is your mistake alone.\n\nAnd a 40 year old guy marrying a 20 year old woman is more than a little creepy", "I'm not going to call you an AH, but you cited two incidents in 22 years.  I can't see that makes him particularly unreliable.", "NAH he is unreliable if you say he doesn't pick up his phone when you call but those examples don't really put him in the wrong either", "Are you sure any friend you call would answer their phone repeatedly, like, you know for a fact they won\u2019t be asleep or have left their phone somewhere?", "So here's the thing about cellphones. There's no way of indicating, at the time that you place the call, \"this is an actual emergency - I need you to answer\" vs \"I just wanted a chat\". And it's also true that people are often away from their phones - either because it ran out of battery and is charging, or is in another room or something.\n\nYou seem to be starting with the assumption that everyone should be surgically attached to their phone at all times. Speaking personally, several of the buildings I routinely work in don't have cell reception inside the building. So if I'm in there, you could call as often as you like, and I won't get the call. Or maybe it's charging, and I've gone to the bathroom or something.\n\nRe your second example, you were driving. It's your responsibility to have the insurance information in your car. Your insurance company probably mails you a card to keep in your car, and if for whatever reason you haven't yet put the new card in your car, you'd at least have the expired one, and you probably didn't change insurance so it's the same information.\n\nIf they don't mail you a physical card, you should print one and put it in your car. The great thing about a piece of paper is that it can't run out of battery, and you can't forget the login details for it.\n\nIt sounds like rather than just assuming that your husband \"should be aware\" that if you call multiple times, it's an emergency, you should tell him that if you just want a chat, you'll call once, and if it's a real \"drop what you're doing because I need help now\" emergency, then you'll call repeatedly. That's a reasonable arrangement to have, but it's not necessarily obvious.\n\nSo what do I think?\n\nI think your car example is entirely self-inflicted. It was an \"emergency\" generated entirely by your failure to carry a paper copy of your insurance details, plus your failure to know your login details for your insurance app. I think you're over-reliant on your cellphone to bail you out of any difficulties you happen to encounter, and that you need to be a bit more self-reliant. And I think there's a whole bunch of reasons why people might not answer their phone.\n\nThat said, if my wife called me repeatedly while I was having lunch with a friend, I would certainly have answered, and so would everyone I know. If she just called once, I'd probably excuse myself, answer, and say something like \"I'm in the middle of something - is this an emergency or can I call you back later?\"\n\nSo I think you're both at fault here, so I'm voting ESH.", "What is His Job? Where Does He Work? Until then YATA.", "ESH\n\nYou said you call him just to tell him stories about the kids etc but ALSO in emergencies - how is he going to know? \n\nObv in the repeated call incident during lunch, he was at fault there - but I don't think OVERALL not always having your phone on you makes you unreliable. Not reaching someone the INSTANT you want to isn't what makes someone reliable. It makes them reliably REACHABLE but that doesn't always mean they are a reliable person. \n\nThey are simply consistent with their communication preferences. (ie always attached) \n\nNow - in the case where you were pregnant - that obv should be a diff situation. If heavily pregnant, his phone should be on him at all times. \n\nLastly - you might look to see if there is an app or a ringtone you can set up to indicate it is important.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hell, I'll even answer if a number I don't recognize calls me back to back, because it could be someone who doesn't have their phone. \n\nI'm sure he thinks he's \"setting a boundary\" but what he's actually doing is being an inconsiderate AH.", "NTA.

If your spouse is calling you in an emergency, you answer. Otherwise, why even marry them in the first place?", "Also, I should\u2019ve included this in the first response, but I think to me an even bigger alarm bell than him not answering is the way he has no remorse over missing these calls even with hindsight re: the emergencies you went through.

I'm 30 and even women as young as ~23-24 usually come off as kinda immature to me. I couldn't focus on the rest of the story after the first sentence. But I guess it's been 22 years? I'll try not to judge her? How were her parents okay with that?\n\nNTA btw, he deserved it. But maybe give him a chance to show he's reliable if it matters to him.", "Same, I could barely focus on the post. He literally groomed her and impregnated her. Then he has the audacity to ignore any issues she has, even when pregnant with his baby! This dude is a walking red flag, only cares about himself.

At your current age would you consider being with someone in their early 20s?  I imagine probably not.  And I\u2019m just speculating but I\u2019d bet he feels awfully secure in your sticking around and feels like he doesn\u2019t need to do any more than he wants to do.  The big issue is that he SHOULD want to and he just\u2026doesn\u2019t. You know this and now you gotta decide what you want to do with that info.  \n\nYou have plenty of time to heal from this relationship and find a wonderful supportive guy that treats you like a spouse should be treated.

You wanted this old fart and I\u2019m sure you saw lots of red flags over the years. You\u2019re choosing to stay with him and put up with this.", "That thought crossed my mind... the therapist is hearing the story from his perspective, which is probably a bit slanted so they ability to judge the situation is compromised.  It's hard to imagine a therapist who had an accurate explanation of the situation not at least pointing out that his behavior is at least a part of the problem.", "Was this a male \u201cfriend\u201d or female?", "I\u2019m don\u2019t buy the \u201cgenerational differences \u201c. I am just a couple of years younger than he is and was in my mid to late 20s before I got my first cell phone. I am also very much of the \u201cI don\u2019t have to answer the phone or return a text immediately- it isn\u2019t a summons it\u2019s a request and I\u2019ll get to it when I decide to\u201d camp (which shocks my 18 yo niece). But if I see someone whose number I know call more than once in a short period of time I answer ir call back immediately- because it could be an emergency. \n\nNow, I\u2019m lucky that I don\u2019t have anyone in my life who abuses that and calls multiple times just to make me answer the phone but it doesn\u2019t sound like that is what she typically does.  So he should know that he needs to answer if she calls more than once in a short time frame. (If I\u2019m wrong and she is someone who calls over and over until someone answers outside of emergencies then she created this situation- but that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case).", "I'm older than your husband. I know how to use the\"Do Not Disturb\" function on my phone, including allowing certain numbers to ring through even when the DND function is on. If your husband is in a situation where he doesn't want to answer MOST calls, he could put his phone on DND , set it up to allow YOUR calls to come through, and then ask you to not call for X period of time unless it's important. \n\nAt least that's what someone who actually CARES about you would do. Anyone who ignores even ONE phone call from his PREGNANT wife doesn't give a damn about your well-being. Suppose something HAD gone wrong and you were miscarrying? What if you'd been hurt in the accident and didn't just need the insurance info? His behavior would justify divorce for me.", "So he values a casual chat about guitars over his actual spouce and kids. And...you're still with this man? Not only has he made it perfectly clear for 20+ years that you're never going to be his first priority, but he doesn't want you to reach out to anyone *else* either apparently. What kind of AH ignores his *pregnant wife's* multiple calls?\n\nPlease do yourself a favour and realize that you only stuck with this man because you got together when you were barely an adult and didn't know any better. There's a reason 40 year old men go after teenagers...nobody their own age would take their shit. Now that you are that age, you're seeing it too.", "Maybe it's me, but I get the impression that she calls a LOT during working hours.  I think they would benefit from a code to let him know that THIS time is serious, but how would he know the difference between just wanting to chat and emergency?", "Fair enough", "Ah ok yeah - no, if it's very set times and rarely then he would know that a call during the day is atypical. \n\nI mean I do think you need to distinguish btw reliably reachable and reliable BUT then also highlight that repeated calls are exceptional AND if ever you are pregnant again, that's a phone-on-you at all times situation. \n\nI'm very connected and my bf knows this whereas he isn't but I know it as well. I don't think it makes him unreliable bc I know he will move heaven and earth for me - vs someone who might be more easily reachable wouldn't. (He recently got us to make up our own Slack channel bc when he's busy w work, he will ignore his phone for hours.) \n\nSo I think it must be a bit hurtful to your husband for you to not make the distinction.", "That's why I suggested there may be an app or feature that conveys importance. Similar to how you can set some numbers to show/ display/ ring even w Do Not Disturb on IIRC tho I'm not sure that's actually what happens. \n\nAgain - suggesting options to research.", "Funny thing...they are usually doing an asshole thing like not helping wife with dishes or putting kids to bed.", "22 years and a 45 minute gap in calling back because \"he was in the bathroom\" seems like more than enough chances lol, OP should absolutely just call a friend next time she needs something", "victim blaming only makes you look bad.", "If you generally have that rule, and your partner ends up calling you multiple times back to back with little to no time in between, and you still don't answer thinking it might even possibly be an emergency, and you know your partner is 6 months pregnant, therefore higher risk for an emergency happening versus normal, then yes you would be in the wrong. And so is he.", "Those don't exist. It is literally impossible for the phone to interpret intent. They would need an entire different phone.", "OP, I\u2019d ignore these people. \n\nThat thought process is *incredibly* stupid, and I can\u2019t believe so many are saying they do this. \n\nIf you have a phone, you should at least be contactable by your spouse, and children, at nearly all times. It\u2019s one thing if your phone gets broken or something else beyond your control, but intentionally making yourself unable to be contacted by people who depend on you, is horrible. \n\nA very small amount of politeness (not having phone ring while eating) is NOT worth being unreachable if something was to happen. It\u2019s very easy to set up DND settings specifically for emergencies and such, so that you can still be polite, AND reachable in case of an emergency.", "I don't think he respects her.", "I used to be like you - didn\u2019t get a phone until almost 2010.  I didn\u2019t want a leash.  \n\nThen I missed a call that my dad was in the hospital while I was out of state visiting friends.  He was okay, but it was a wake-up call.  \n\nI still don\u2019t love being 24/7 available (though I have to admit, portable internet is pretty sweet - typing this from a parking lot!).  But, refusing to make myself reachable in emergencies when I had the means was just selfish.", "Oh I don't have any problems with cell phones, and I've had a smart phone since HTC's were popular, but if I'm at a work dinner or with friends it's really, really intrusive to have the phone going off.\n\nMaybe it is just me, but my wife knows where I'm at on the regular. If she isn't conscious the cops/EMT's aren't getting into her phone to get my number, and if she is they're going to know to call wherever I'm at.\n\nThis isn't an all the time thing either. Just in situations where being consistently interrupted is in poor taste.", "Sounds like a sad life to be tethered to an electronic device and be at it's mercy 24/7. Not even being able to completely switch it off or set it to airplane mode in a goddamn cinema is utterly ridiculous to me."]}
