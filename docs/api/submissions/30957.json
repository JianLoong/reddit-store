That she is the product of my mom cheating on her son.

I have been reconnecting with them and it came to a head today.  My parents  learned who I was hanging out with.\n\nThis resulting in an argument for taking the money when they shun Kathy. I told them they were right to not consider her a grandkid and to screw then for cutting them out of my life.\n\nThey haven\u2019t talked to me since and I am doubting myself.\n\nSince it was asked multiple times, Kathy bio dad has partial custody, my dad never adopted her which according to some redditors means that bio dad has to give up his rights", "created_utc": 1699972848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17v3n65/aita_for_taking_the_money_my_grandparents_saved/", "score": 2331, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In this economy, you're gonna need that college fund. You're also an adult and you can create your own relationship w your grandparents if you want - your parents are just gonna have to suck it up.", "NTA your grandparents are right Kathy (absolutely Not at fault Here) is not their grandchild but a constant reminder how your Mom cheated on their son. Even If your dad forgave her that doesn't mean, everyone needs to and everyone needs to treat her like she is your dads. \n\nThey even robbed you of your grandparents, just because they felt entiteld to grandparents Money.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't ask for your grandparents to be cut out of your life, but you were a kid and didn't have a say in the matter. Now that you're an adult, you do have a say and it sounds like you're happy to reconnect with them (not just for the money). \n\nIt's a messy situation in your family for sure, due to the affair resulting in a kid, which again, you had nothing to do with and no say in the situation. I still say take the money for college as you're going to need the financial help in this economy.", "NTA. She isn't  their grandkid. It's  their money and they can give it to who they want to. Or not.", "NTA\n\nYour grandparents had no obligation to set up a fund for your half sister.  Your parents had the right to cut off your contact when you were a minor but you are an adult and have the right to reconnect with them.  If they are so upset about the money, then they should have a child support order against your half-sister's bio father.  If he hasn't been paying then he owes a LOT of back support.", "NTA. I understand your parents wanting to protect Kathy from rejection  but they sacrificed your relationship with your grandparents in then process.  You got punished because your grandparents wouldn't accept your mother's affair child. Your father made the decision to accept Kathy as his own but that doesn't mean your grandparents or extended family  had to do the same. They made the decision that it was best for Kathy to cut off contact which meant they took away the relationship and bond you had with your grandparents.  This was a situation where they put what they thought was best for Kathy before what was best for you. Now that you are an adult you get to decide what is best for you. You are allowed to purse a relationship with your grandparents that is separate from your relationship with your parents.", "NTA. It is not your fault your mom cheated and it is not your responsability to make your grandparents accept your half-sister.", "NTA to take the money.\n\nYour grandparents have no obligation towards your sister.   It sucks for her that she'll never be their grandkid, but that's your grandparents' choice.  It's possible your parents  and grandparents will never  reconcile this situation.  But that does not mean that they stopped being your grandparents. Take the money if you want.", "NTA you need money for college. Your grandparents are technically right and it\u2019s sad that Kathy is the innocent in all of this but affairs do wreak havoc on families. Your parents aren\u2019t being fair depriving you of an opportunity for college because of your grandparents and their anger/ choices.", "NTA. The grandparents were correct. Kathy is not their grandchild and they will not take care of her or create a scholarship fund. Your mom\u2019s affair partner or her side of the family should have done all of that. Just because your father was a doormat, didn't give your parents the right to end the relationship with your grandparents. I'm surprised you don't have resentment toward your parents or Kathy, which is good because it's not Kathy\u2019s fault for your mom's actions. Continue building a relationship with them, accept their gift, and don't be controlled or feel bad about this situation. You are an adult and can do what you want to do.", "NTA. Your parents decided to make their marriage work after an affair that resulted in your maternal half-sibling. I don't believe your paternal grandparents are in the wrong here. Biologically they have one granddaughter and made financial plans accordingly. Setting up a college fund for a child that is not their son's kid *and* has an active bio father in her life is a ridiculous expectation. I'll wager your parents wanted your paternal grandparents to treat both of you the same because they couldn't see another way to work this unusual situation. I am assuming your half-sibling has maternal and paternal grandparents. How active those grandparents are is not the issue. The point is you were denied access to your grandparents. Now you are of age and you rightly reconnected with them. Most grandparents are a blessing. We only get them for a little while. Enjoy the time you have with them.", "NTA. It would be different if this was your mom\u2019s parents but it\u2019s your dad\u2019s. Your parents ended an important relationship for you because they didn\u2019t agree with your dad raising his wife\u2019s baby out of an affair. There is no reason why you needed to be punished for their shitty choices.

If your parents hadn\u2019t cut them off (over the college fund thing) then your grandparents likely would have warmed up to her and eventually accepted her and likely set up a fund.\n\nMy family had something similar happen.  One of my uncle\u2019s wife cheated on him when he was stationed in Germany.  She got pregnant as a result.  They managed to reconcile, and though while the youngest of his children isn\u2019t his, the family treats her the same as her sisters and brother.  This was because they didn\u2019t reject the family after the initial fallout and people grew to love my cousin.", "NTA, your parents put the financial stability of you half-sister before yours. Your father chose to consider your half-sister his, but his parents didn't have to make that same choice. It is jarring that they both give you a clear message of who their favorite", "NTA. Why should you lose out because your mother can\u2019t keep her legs shut. And purely on a factual basis Kathy isn\u2019t their grand child. The audacity of your mother expecting them to set up a college fund for a child that isn\u2019t even related to them is truly something special.", "NTA. \n\nYour grandparents had no moral obligation to start a college fun for a child they aren\u2019t related to. But they do have a moral obligation to treat Kathy kindly, she\u2019s faultless here and doesn\u2019t deserve to be hurt.\n\nIf your parents cut your grandparents out of their lives, not over money, but because they treated Kathy poorly or threatened to treat her poorly, that\u2019s understandable, but that doesn\u2019t mean YOU can\u2019t have a relationship with them.", "NTA. Your college fund ironically benefits the whole family as your parents will not have that financial worry. And why shouldn't you have a relationship with your grandparents now that you're 18? And of course you're angry you missed out on 8 years of bonding with them. I do understand they were trying to protect your half-sister from a harsh truth, which is laudable, but you paid a price for their decision.", "Honestly, this is not an easy answer.  Are your grandparents on your mother or father\u2019s side? I can understand why they took it so personally if they are your father\u2019s parents.  It sounds like there are complicated and potentially toxic dynamics in some of the family relationships.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to build a relationship with your grandparents Just because your mother and and half sister dont have one so long as it\u2019s not cruel or manipulative in its current state.  I\u2019m in a family that has some rifts between members but no one holds it against anyone else for continuing their own relationships.  Those are choices those adult members made for themselves, the kids shouldn\u2019t be punished or manipulated into making the same ones.", "NTA", "NTA your an adult and can have a relationship with whomever you want.", "So, did you spend time with Kathy's dad and his parents? Irrelevant, the point is she did have other family. \nYour parents are TA for taking you out of your grandparents' life and vice versa. I'm sure they would warmed to her once everything settled down.

Technically, she isn\u2019t their grandkid.", "NTA - people are allowed to spend their money as they so chose.\n\nYour father\u2019s investment in your sister is not one your paternal family is/was willing to match. That\u2019s incredibly unfortunate, but they cannot make them do anything.\n\nThe truth is that the repercussions of infidelity are far reaching. Your paternal families choice to not maintain or want that relationship is their choice; good, bad, or indifferent.\n\nThe responsibility here falls to your mother. She chose to cheat, and she must accept that everyone won\u2019t be willing to accept that in the way your father has.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re caught in the middle.", "You are 100% right to take the money.  Going into debt to pay for school bc your mom is a cheater and your grandparents didn't reward her for it would be insane. Take that money and just stop talking to your parents about it. You already made a huge mistake telling them you took it. \n\nBut, and this is very important, you need to stop arguing with your parents about this.  It will only make things worse.  Just accept the money.  Make sure it's in an account that only you and you grandparents can access.  And never, ever, ever mention the amount to your parents, so matter what.  \n\nAs a teenager, you aren't thinking ahead to what happens if they get pissed off about this and cut you off financially.

And this kid has her own dad who she sees and grandparents, uncles etc on that side. \n\nSincerely why would your father insist on that? Idk what else happened but, on its own it\u2019s weird that your father cut his own parents over this. \n\nAs it is NTA, and with the limited information you gave I would say your grandparents are NTA either.", "NTA and why would you want to stay in contact with a mother like THAT and such a weak father. Better to cut them off from your life. They\u2019re clearly bad people", "NTA\nThe problems between your parents with your grandparents shouldn't affect you. You want a relationship with them and that's healthy, your parents have no business trying to pass their anger to you. I'm not saying that your grandparents are right to be mad at the kid but still that's between them and your parents. As for the money, they're for your good and not all people are lucky to have something like this. The fact that your parents put their bad relationship above you and your own good shows it's egoistic. I think you should have an honest talk with them and explain that you need a relationship with your grandparents without it having to mean that you support their opinion on your half sister.", "Your father's parents are under no obligation to recognize or accept your mother's affair baby. It is unfortunate that the relationship devolved so far but that's not on you. I'd hope your parents would be relieved that they only need to worry about college funds for one kid... Oftentimes we get blinded by the forest and can't see the trees", "NTA. Someone here commented you should tell your grandparents to accept your half-sister as family (even if not to give money to). I Disagree--Don't tell your grandparents any such thing. It's their money, their decision, and not any of your business. Just enjoy your new relationship with your grandparents. Don't make foolish demands or attach strings that might offend them. They've made their stand clear.  Just get close to them, something your parents didn't allow before.  \nAnyway, you're 18 now.

Why do parents, especially if one of them has a cheating record that has affected the child, expect their kids to live in the frame they set, and accept their rules and agree with them on everything. Like, they should\u2019ve gotten a pet instead of a child then. Both ur parents r the AHs. And don\u2019t even get me started on your mom. Why do your grandparents need to invest their hard earned money into a grandchild that\u2019s not even theirs. Why does everyone have to just accept your mom\u2019s cheating. WTF.

Oh my God.", "I'm sorry OP. But I think you are right to side with your grandparents here.  Without trying to be a dick, you mom cheated on your dad, then expected his parents to give the affair baby around 100k.  Which is just crazy.  And I don't understand how your dad can not only stay with the woman that cheated on him.

I doubt that your father would cut contact with his parents exclusively because they refused to create a college fund for your half sibling.  I would keep my head on a swivel around these grandparents.\n\nBut if that's actually true, then there is something really wrong with your dad.  It's a major character flaw to *expect* anything as substantial as a college fund for your kids as an adult child.  The vast majority of parents would see this as a luxury and a major bonus.

You are not responsible for your grandparents feelings towards a child that is biologically not related to them.  This is a tricky situation and I can see both points of view, this scenario actually happened in my family.  \n\nMy nephew married a woman with a child and they had a child together.  After the birth of their child, she had an affair with a drug addict, convicted felon who was sent back to prison.  Turns out she was pregnant. My nephew divorced her and she lost custody of her children.  My nephew eventually took her back, but luckily hasn't remarried her and still has sole custody of the children.  All 3 of her children have different fathers.  Prior to the affair baby, she had an affair with the father of her first child.  Way too many details to go into here.  Suffice it to say we are all just waiting for the second affair baby and hoping that will finally end my nephew's obsession with this woman.\n\nKeep connecting with your grandparents; you should not have to suffer the loss of them for your mother's mistake.", "NTA\n\nYour grandparents want to have a relationship with you; they do not want to have a relationship with their estranged daughter-in-law's affair child.\n\nYour dad is within his rights to forgive your mom, and even assist in raising your half sister; however, the notion that your parents get to dictate adult relationships is faulty. You get to decide, at 18, what relationships you want. This is the concept of voluntary association, and a staple of civilized society.\n\nYour grandparents are likely sickened by the daily reminder of your mother's betrayal of your father. Your parents do not get to have any say in how your grandparents feel about the situation. I'd wager if you maintain your relationship with your grandparents, you will likely inherit whatever assets they have, in lieu of your parents receiving everything. This is a result of your mother allowing a wee wee inside her that didn't belong to your father. Actions have consequences. Your parents might end up distancing themselves from you. Sucks, but everyone has made choices, except Kathy. It majorly sucks for her. Nevertheless, you have made the best decision by accepting this helping hand for your life.

That she is the product of my mom cheating on her son. They refused to make a college fund for her and my parents cut them out due to it.\n\nThey informed me that I have a college fund from them and I decide to take it. I came home and kept it to myself. I have been reconnecting with them and it came to a head today.  They learned who I was hanging out with.\n\nThis resulting in an argument for taking the money when they shun Kathy.

Hard to say with certainty with the information given.\n\nBut the DIL\u2019s affair child has no inherent right to a grandparent relationship with the parents of the cheated on partner.", "Well it\u2019s the paternal grandparents considering a child born from adultery from the mom to not be their grand child which seems to be true.", "They have more right than anyone to define who they see as their grandchild. OP said her sister's biological father shares custody. The younger child already has paternal grandparents.", "Bio-dad also has a relationship with Kathy (I infer from child support but don't remember if OP said he was actually involved or not) so does Dad actually consider her to be fully his or is he cautious to \"stay in his lane\" as a step parent tends to do? Although he has been in her life since she was born, if her bio dad wanted a relationship with her, then dad would have an obligation to either not interfere with parenting decisions made by both bio parents (though could work with his wife when she gave her input on them) or petition to adopt if child could be considered legally abandoned (with or without child support) or if bio dad would give up parental rights. This question is not relevant to OP's post but may help with your understanding. (I read your other replies even though it's not in this particular one)\n   \nDad's parents *could* be considered step-grandparents. But while some states give grandparents legal rights to a child if they seek them or if grandparents were to pass away without a Will and their children are deceased law would grant grandchildren the estate, step grandparents and step children are not included in either of these circumstances.\n\nThe law does not recognize them as having a relationship so is step grandparent an actual label to be given or is it a label we give out of courtesy? Would one have a step great-aunt from their step parent's aunt if they had no relationship with that aunt or would that label come as a gesture to express that they considered the aunt as family if they did have a relationship with her? Who does have control of the labels? How meaningfully are they defined? To me it would seem that if a family label has no actual meaning outside of the family then it would be up to.each individual family member to define who they are. My cousin and I are 1 year apart in age, both only children, and were brought up close. I consider her children my neice and nephew although they are my second cousins. \n   \nAs OP mentioned, her parents cut the grandparents off. The grandparents did not want a relationship with the step granddaughter and were working their son to divorce. Now, while you are partially correct that they can't define who is actually family because marriage and genetics do that, even if Dad does consider Kathy to be fully his child, she is still actually his step-child which means she is their step-grandchild not grandchild regardless of what Dad feels. But again, is a step grand parent an *actual* thing or is it a title we give people we consider family to establish a relationship where there's not one?\n   \nThey have never had a relationship with her at all, let alone as a step grandchild.\n   \nSo, according to your logic that Dad accepts her as his child so she *is* his child and not step child, then so should it be that the grandparents do not accept her as their step-child and therefore can say she is not.", "A small one, the grandparents one is like 4 times the amount.", "Seems like she does yes, the bio dad has half custody.", "What was his wrong though?", "Given how the parents have behaved OP is already the bigger person.", "There was definitely some emotion in it. It must have been weird to be a 10 year old and suddenly your mom cheated on your dad and your parents won\u2019t let you see your grandparents.\n\nIt\u2019s not dignified and it does give up some power by being emotional. But also not all discussions need to prioritize being polite, dignified, and cool. I just can\u2019t blame an honest response.", "OP says in a comment that the half-sister's father has partial custody", "Sounds like one of those families where they think that money is how you show love. More wealth than affection.", "Op and their parents are allowed to have different feelings toward the grandparents.  The parents cannot control adult children.", "It's not thier fault. However strong feelings negative or positive are attached to a child conceived this way. \nFeelings get hurt, lives get destroyed and marriages end. \nThe affair baby will be a symbol of all that strong emotion. Its not fair, but neither is getting cheated on.", "They had no obligation to accept Kathy, but even if they didn't, that is not a justification to cut OP off from their grandparents.", "When someone is asking for advice on a topic, and your response is to start correcting their grammar, that's rude AF.\n\nSure, the individual words aren't, but the action in this context sure as hell is. \n\n\"I need help with a serious problem and I'm seeking your advice on it.\"\n\"That sentence needs a comma.\"\n\nNone of those words were particularly rude, but I would never ask that person anything again.", "If they were becoming better people they wouldn\u2019t have had tantrums about OP having a relationship with her own grandparents.", "Nope..as the father choice to accept her ..it is also up to the grandparents to accept her...", "It's not \"put on Kathy.\" They have a clear rule: All of their grandchildren get a college fund.

I understand not doing a college fund because of the history, but they are still family regardless of the biology", "That's what it says. However, I can tell you that is also exactly what a manipulative person says when their control tactics don't work. By focusing on the money, it makes them seem reasonable and the other person  entitled. So the argument can go like this: 'we will never see Kathy as a family member and we won't pay for schooling like we will for your son. Also, you need to divorce her mother.' By accepting this behavior, the father would be allowing his wife and daughter to be treated as second class citizens in the family so he cuts them out. The grandparents frame it as entitlement towards their money while the parents see it as a strong statement of rejection and manipulation.  The money is the symbol and mechanism of their control and abuse and the parents are right to be upset about that.", "Ya my parents, bless them, weren\u2019t the greatest parents to us kids but my goodness they LOVED being grandparents.
