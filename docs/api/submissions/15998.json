Since there was a limit on the size of the party due to the amount of materials that needs to be prep and space available for the girls, I sent out an Evite type of invitation for people to rsvp and get a final count on the guests. I also sent out a reminder that even though the girls will be making their own pizza, the girls will also be getting a light snack and drinks when the pizzas are in the oven. Since it was a baking theme party I went ahead and bought 15 white aprons for kids and personalized them with ironed on cupcakes and other baking motif. I was also able to find other baking related items such as a small whisk for the goody bags. I got all the rsvps and made 15 goody bags for the girls. When we were there to help set up the party, one of my daughter\u2019s friend brought her younger sister along for the party. I was irritated because the invite clearly stated limited space available and I didn\u2019t allow people to bring a plus one on the reply option. I spoke to the owner of the bakery and was able to add one more person (cost of the party was based on the number of participants) but now I don\u2019t have enough goody bags for everyone. I was debating whether I should rush home and miss part of my daughters party to make another goody bag or just not give one to the younger sister who tagged along. In the end my husband and friends said that I shouldn\u2019t have to miss my daughters birthday party with her friends because someone decided to add their daughter to the party without asking us first. So I discreetly went and handed out the favors to the girls instead of telling them to grab one on their way out. The little girl obviously thought she would get one but didn\u2019t say anything. And since it was a drop off party, the parents could just drop them off and come back 2 hours later\u2026 however we found out that the mom actually was outside the bakery the whole time and was aware of the situation. She made no attempt to even correct the situation when she realized that there was no additional seating or spoke to us about it. Instead she bought herself some pastries and went outside to chat with her friend. Personally I never met this mom but I was appalled at her behavior. In the end I didn\u2019t want any of my daughters friend not getting a goody bag so I decided not to give that girl a goody bag.

But you legitimately didn't have one available, and it would have required time and effort you didn't have in order to get another one. \n\nFrankly, you handled the entire situation with thoughtfulness and kindness.

But a dad who brought his two daughters along, since it was only fair as he said, took/confiscated an entire pizza, and walked off with his girls to another table.
