Since there was a limit on the size of the party due to the amount of materials that needs to be prep and space available for the girls, I sent out an Evite type of invitation for people to rsvp and get a final count on the guests. I also sent out a reminder that even though the girls will be making their own pizza, the girls will also be getting a light snack and drinks when the pizzas are in the oven. Since it was a baking theme party I went ahead and bought 15 white aprons for kids and personalized them with ironed on cupcakes and other baking motif. I was also able to find other baking related items such as a small whisk for the goody bags. I got all the rsvps and made 15 goody bags for the girls. When we were there to help set up the party, one of my daughter\u2019s friend brought her younger sister along for the party. I was irritated because the invite clearly stated limited space available and I didn\u2019t allow people to bring a plus one on the reply option. I spoke to the owner of the bakery and was able to add one more person (cost of the party was based on the number of participants) but now I don\u2019t have enough goody bags for everyone. I was debating whether I should rush home and miss part of my daughters party to make another goody bag or just not give one to the younger sister who tagged along. In the end my husband and friends said that I shouldn\u2019t have to miss my daughters birthday party with her friends because someone decided to add their daughter to the party without asking us first. So I discreetly went and handed out the favors to the girls instead of telling them to grab one on their way out. The little girl obviously thought she would get one but didn\u2019t say anything. And since it was a drop off party, the parents could just drop them off and come back 2 hours later\u2026 however we found out that the mom actually was outside the bakery the whole time and was aware of the situation. She made no attempt to even correct the situation when she realized that there was no additional seating or spoke to us about it. Instead she bought herself some pastries and went outside to chat with her friend. Personally I never met this mom but I was appalled at her behavior. In the end I didn\u2019t want any of my daughters friend not getting a goody bag so I decided not to give that girl a goody bag. So AITA for not giving that little girl a goody bag even though she wasn\u2019t invited in the first place?", "created_utc": 1682789976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1331ws8/aita_for_giving_gifts_bags_only_to_the_girls_who/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The little girl might be disappointed but that\u2019s her moms fault, not yours. I wouldn\u2019t have allowed the child to come to the party since it was at your expense, and her parent should be the one explaining why. You got stuck in a shitty situation but you handled it fine.", "NTA. Neither is that poor child (I'm sure this isn't the first and won't be the last time her mother thrusts her into inappropriate situations). \n\nIf you *happened* to have an extra goody bag lying around (especially if it were like most goody bags and contained mass produced items from the dollar store) and were refusing to give it to the girl as a matter of principle, that would be an AH-ish thing to do, because that would have been intentionally punishing the girl for something that was her mother's fault. But you legitimately didn't have one available, and it would have required time and effort you didn't have in order to get another one. \n\nFrankly, you handled the entire situation with thoughtfulness and kindness. If the mother had noticed the lack of a goody bag and had the nerve to confront you about it, you could have simply said, \"I only had goody bags for the children who were expected guests.\" \n\nIf you are the confrontational type (I'm not), you could even add: \"I didn't expect to be babysitting an unexpected child... obviously, I won't charge you for the babysitting since it wound up working out okay, just pay me back for the activity. It cost $X and I can accept cash or Venmo.\"", "NTA an unannounced guest isnt your problem. \n\nIt was kind enough to ask the owner to squeeze in another child, and I assume pizza, rather than make the sisters share the pizza. \n\nYou could have given the two sisters the goody bag and told them they can share it.", "NTA but what is it with some parent thinking it's okay to bring a tag along to birthday parties? If they weren't invited they can stay home, since mom obviously didn't have important plans.", "First let me say SOOO not the AH!! I actually had to put my phone down for a few minutes I became so pissed after reading this! PISSED!! I have had this happen to me many times. From personal birthday parties to class room parties where the teachers actually sent emails stating NO siblings allowed. The audacity of parents! My sons 2nd grade Christmas party had not one but two moms EACH bring in 3 siblings. And neither mom sent in anything off the donation food list. When refused admittance to the class room the one mom started ranting well who cares Santa doesn\u2019t exist. I have personally had two birthday parties at a Chuck E. Cheese that I was limited on seats. I was nice enough to order extra pizza for the parents who stayed around. But a dad who brought his two daughters along, since it was only fair as he said, took/confiscated an entire pizza, and walked off with his girls to another table. You are more than correct in giving out the goody bags to the girls that were invited. Since her mom felt entitled to insert the other daughter it\u2019s on her if there\u2019s an issue. You may not know this mom, but I would certainly keep it in the back of my mind should you ever run into her and bring it up? Unfortunately you can\u2019t and are not allowed to fix stupidity with a 2 x 4!!! So long as your daughter had a great party, and was happy, that\u2019s all that matters. But remember this for the next party!", "NTA but I would have told her mother a thing or two on my way out the door\u2026", "NTA That girl will soon realize what a flake her mother is when things like this keep happening. This isn\u2019t on you, and your daughter needs her you at her birthday party. You put incredible thought and work into this, and you should get to deserve it without the rudeness of this mom taking that from you.", "i don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA.

The mother is clearly TA, trying to sneak her other uninvited kid in for free babysitting.", "Of course nta.", "NTA - The mother was extremely rude.", "NTA\n\nThe accomodation was nice. Every single parent knows you need to ok the siblings at birthday parties, ESPECIALLY if it's a drop off, or limited invite.", "NTA\n\nThe fact you didn\u2019t immediately call the girl\u2019s parent and say, \u201cthe party is for invited guests only, come get your child\u201d says you are absolutely NTA.\n\nThe child got to participate, which cost you extra $$.

The sad thing is this mother is probably going to do this enough that her daughter will stop getting invites to anything unless its a mass party event (and maybe even then). Plus the fact that she cannot get away from her sister for some time with just her friends is going to basically kill her social life when she gets older.", "NTA that is not your problem since she wasn\u2019t even invited.

You were kind enough to get her added to participate in the activity, that's more than enough. It's not as though you intentionally skipped a goody bag for her out of maliciousness, you prepared enough for the children meant to be attending.\n\nThe only thing I maybe would have done differently is giving the goody bag to both girls, letting them know they would have to share because you're sorry you didn't know little sister was attending, so unfortunately there weren't enough.", "NTA. When I read the title, I though you only gave the girls invited a goodie bag, and not the boys invited, and I was instantly thinking yes! YTA \nBut then I read the whole thing, and it sounds like you tried really hard to give the girls' a magical experience, and included the extra child to the best of your abilities at the last minute. I have NEVER shown up with extra people to an occasion I was invited to without speaking with clearing it with the host prior. That mom is the one that needs to take ownership of how her daughter felt, and hopefully she learned not to do that again, but I doubt it.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "NTA \n\nThis is the fault of the other mom.

And they often charge per child fee which include space, material and teaching and watching children (making sure no one is touching hot oven, etc).\n\nIt\u2019s different if event place is just renting out space without any staff attending. Then people need to watch children by themselves (doesn\u2019t mean all parents).", "I don't think it's necessarily to actually take care of the children. I think it's to help cover their liability costs, in case one of the children gets hurt at some point on their property.\n\nThe exception to that being if it is an activity that the staff has to participate in. An extra child is extra work for the staff in that case.", "I understand what you saying and it\u2019s not \u201cbaby sitting\u201d because they are not responsible to change kids clothes or something.
