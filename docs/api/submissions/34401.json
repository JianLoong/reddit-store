She could have developed that allergy later, and even with all of her attention-seeking bullshit, allergies should be taken seriously.\n\nIntentionally feeding her an allergen is considered assault in a lot of places.

I simply can't stand her. When we were younger she would lie to all the kids at school about having things like tourettes, diabetes, and even cancer. She would do absolutely anything for attention, despite having none of them once we would get home and no one was watching\n\nLately she had been saying she was allergic to everything, one of witch being peanuts. I swore that I had seen her eat peanuts when we were younger and it got me in a complete really riled up that shed lie about the smallest thing. So I thought I'd call her out for it, but since no one would believe me I needed proof.\n\nI ended up making peanut butter cookies, but put chocolate chips in them to look like they were just chocolate ship cookies. So at our next family get together I brought them and handed them to her as soon as I got through the door. She ate one almost whole. She then began to freak out once she realized they weren't chocolate chip.\n\nWell...turns out she started having an allergic reaction. We didn't have any epipens or anything so an ambulance was called. I feel really bad but I think it's understandable why I didn't believe her. Everyone's been berating me ever since then.

You don't adulterate other people's food: that is called poisoning, and it's a crime.\n\nI'm sure she's frustrating to be around, but the solution to that is not to spend time with her. If other people ask, say, \"she's a liar, and not an entertaining one\", and move on.\n\nIf she'd died (possible, even with an EpiPen, even with an ambulance, even with a hospital), you would be sitting in jail right now, waiting for a lawyer, and the people who loved her would be deep in mourning.\n\nTake this moment to reflect on why it was so important to you to discredit her.
