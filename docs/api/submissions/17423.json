I can't explain what I've been through in this post but know it was bad enough to warrant my uncle, step father #1 and male cousin going to prison for years (for the same crime- they did it together). Step father #2 was just as bad but I was too afraid to speak up at that point  but I was eventually taken by the state cause one of my friends told the school. Not that it helped because this cycle continued the entire time I was in foster care, just about, except for the last years (15-18). \n\nI had my daughter with a misogynistic dirt bag. 100% my fault. I went for the same type of man I hated because it was what I knew. I quite literally \"escaped\" him but not without hospital bills. My daughter was 3. So when I met my husband 2 years later and realized he was the complete opposite of everything I had known and saw what real love was, it was a god send. The issue is his sister and his sisters kid. His neice is overly sexualized. Like.. has a TikTok and posts videos of her in skimpy bikini's, tries getting my daughter to play \"dress up\" where they look like literal hookers and talks about things with my child that should be talks with ME, not another child.

My daughter had told me everything that had happened over there and had no idea it was \"wrong\" until I explained to her why it was.

Keep your daughter away from those parents and their messed up kid.  There's nothing to mediate here.  You absolutely did the right thing.", "Oh noooo... NTA!   That a 12 year old is discussing those things with a 10 year old is not right.   Also I would not be good with creepy men on tiktok commenting on young kids dancing in bikinis.", "NTA. The fact that your SIL and her husband can't see the danger in their 12-year-old wearing skimpy bikinis and having old men commenting on her only shows that they're not going to respect your boundaries. You are her parent, and you decide when these conversations can happen.", "NTA, they need to remove those videos otherwise get an attorney to make them remove the videos.  That girl and her parents are extremely stupid and I wouldn\u2019t doubt that they have posted identifiable information online as well- like what school they go to or what city they live in.  There is also nothing normal about young girls talking about their parents sex lives.  If your husband can\u2019t understand that, he is the one you need to make boundaries with.  Maybe he isn\u2019t a great guy either.", "NTA.\n\nA 12-year-old is going to be developing their own sexual feelings and identity, which is natural. What worries me is how *adult* her sexual behaviour is. I hate to think who is viewing her TikToks! While it's fine for a child to be aware of sex existing and their parents having it, why on earth does she know details about it? \n\nI think you're right to feel concerned and to want to keep your daughter safe from this.", "NTA. Report their daughter's account for being underage - she'll probably just make a new one, but it will temporarily get her off of the platform. I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure it'll also get rid of the videos, thus removing the ones with your daughter.  \n\n\nYou're doing nothing wrong. While there's merit in not making kids feel like mature activities are \"shameful\"once they're old enough to begin recieving \"the talk\" ... that is a discussion that you need to have with your daughter, not someone else. They have absolutely no right to make that choice for you, or allow her to do risky behaviors. If they can't understand why you're upset, then I wouldn't trust them with her either.", "NTA. If it weren't for the inappropriate sexual discussion from the SIL kid, it might have be most tactful to ask the SIL to respect your boundaries and ensure her daughter doesn't post her to TikTok. But considering you can't control what the SIL kid decides to tell your child, I wouldn't be letting them spend time together anymore, and I certainly wouldn't let her stay the night again. \n\nI'd think your outburst is warranted especially considering your background. Stick to your instincts.", "NTA that\u2019s creepy af.", "Nta.  Given the circumstances I think you're justified.  Your husband is right that you need boundaries and maybe not no contact but they're going to need to come a long way in their end", "NTA. I hope the niece is safe and just being raised by irresponsible parents vs. being actively groomed. But, good job standing firm and protecting your daughter from that behavior.", "NTA. You\u2019re 100% right to protect your daughter as you see fit. It\u2019s not up to you tell your SIL how to raise her daughter, but you can choose whether your own child is exposed to that. \n\nParents discussing their sexual positions and preferences with their kids of any age is totally inappropriate. And CREEPY.  Accusing you of being a prude or overreacting is any easy way to ensure they continue to have access to your daughter and you stop asking questions. Let those alarm bells ring and keep her out of that house. \n\nIf your daughter has questions about sex, that\u2019s for you to answer.", "NTA. That 12 yo girl technically shouldn't even be old enough to be on TikTok, and her behavior is arguably unsafe. To further rope your 10 yo kid into it to be sexualized by creepy old men is completely unacceptable (ideally, these creeps don't exist. But they do, and it's our responsibility to teach our kids how to safely navigate a world in which creeps exist). Also, it's one thing to talk about bedroom stuff (which... I personally find 10 to be just on the cusp of being the appropriate age for such a discussion, depending on what exactly is being discussed), but holy shit, they filmed tbe discussion and put it on TikTok?? Your SIL is insane for thinking that's acceptable. I would get an attorney involved to remove those videos that sexualize your daughter. This is not a small matter.", "NTA- at all. I think you\u2019re being a protective mama and if they can\u2019t understand that they don\u2019t have to. She\u2019s your child not theirs.", "Nta. That's not normal.", "NTA\n\nI don't even have words. Fight for daughter to be a kid as long as possible.", "NTA and report her account. I would frankly call CPS if they\u2019re allowing her to post on there with grown ass men commenting on it.", "NTA. Creepy? More disturbing! Other way, kids\u2019 shouldn\u2019t know about their parents sex life and talk about it with other kids. So wrong!", "NTA - I\u2019m a person who has never found the fact my parents have sex weird or embarrassing. I\u2019ve mainly just been happy that they are still in love/fancy each other enough to be doing that after 50 years together. But I recognise that a) I\u2019m an anomaly and b) that it\u2019s not something I should discuss with other people even as adult never mind as a 12 yr old. \n\nIf I, an autistic woman who struggles with boundaries and social cues, can see that this is HIGHLY inappropriate- then for damn sure this Sil should be able to see it. Honestly talking to a minor about sex on camera seems like a fetish and that should be illegal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

BUT\u2026 10-12 years old is the normal time for kids to find a curiosity in sex and psychical affection. Whether it\u2019s asking where babies come from or seeing couples kiss and asking questions. They see physical intimacy in their daily lives every day. My parents never had \u201cthe talk\u201d with me, and it definitely wasn\u2019t a good idea to make it go that way. Today, you\u2019ll figure out anything and everything on the internet like i did. which is also not a good idea. Consider talking to your daughter about these things. you\u2019re correct about mostly everything but she is getting older. No one is saying she is old enough to be doing anything like that or talking about it like that, but children aren\u2019t stupid. they can put context clues together and fill in information for themselves. you can\u2019t protect your daughter from all children who may have more access to things they shouldn\u2019t. Most of the things kids pick up also come from school. You\u2019re 100% right in parenting your daughter however you want but you cannot be overbearing,protective, or secretive about things you consider \u201ctoo adult\u201d for her age because she will be influenced by society and its flaws no matter what. I think you aren\u2019t crazy as well, you have trauma and it\u2019s also very important to protect your children from creeps. I do feel you let your trauma and emotions fuel a lot of ur reaction which is okay but something to consider. overall reaction was valid.\n\nEDIT: i personally do not think minors should have access to the internet. it\u2019s a sick place, i don\u2019t even feel comfortable with my younger sister (15) on it. it influences,exposes and encourages sexual behavior in minors. Older men are all over tik tok,instagram,snapchat. they will pray on innocent minors who think it\u2019s okay to post things like such without knowing these creeps are saving and sharing in whatever realm of the internet they use to share such sick things.", "**YTA.** You overreacted and cutting off contact with family is far too severe. I'm not saying let your daughter do whatever she wants with her cousin or that the cousing didn't make some big mistakes here, but there should be some compromised middle ground here. You and your husband need to talk, like adults, and come up with a solution as to how your family will navigate these waters. 10-12 year old is about the time this kind of stuff starts coming up. If you shut things down like you're suggesting, it's just a recipe for complexes, repressed feelings and disaster. What they need is guidance.", "I mean, you aren't wrong for being highly uncomfortable with it, being concerned about your niece's well-being and questioning the parenting choices by your SIL/BIL. You aren't wrong for drawing new boundaries and not allowing the kids to be alone together or your SIL/BIL to care for your daughter without you or your husband present. \n\nBut, I do think your delivery left a lot to be desired. I believe this could have been addressed more peacefully and privately. You could have worked with your husband, educated your daughter, and might not have even needed to direct any attacks at the others. It seems like this has blown up in a way it didn't need to, and that's probably driven in part by your own background and sensitivities. Your daughter is lucky to have you but consider whether you could do any peacekeeping here.", "NTA.  More creepies. YIKES!", "NTA- your past more than justifies the reaction. Do they know about your past? At least in general.  \n\nAnd you are right to be concerned. Statistically speaking.   \n\nThe biggest moment for me is the 12 year old bringing your daughter online with tik tok. That's a big red flag. Playing dress up and acting like you're going to the club is not that big of a deal. Saying they dress like hookers is sexualizing a minor. They are just dressing up funny.   \n\n\nAnd your SIL just has a different view of openness about sex.    \n\nIf they do respect you- a good healthy conversation about boundaries around you and your daughter would be great.  \n\nMy kids have a simple rule- they are not to be on social media or anyone's social media. And if they ever feel uncomfortable in a situation with adults- they can run off and come to me.  Even if that means leaving class or school. \n\nIn spite of that- my kids have had a few negative experiences. Nothing at your level- but things will happen. Showing your daughter how to deal with things calmly and logically will be very very helpful for her upbringing.  \n\nYour sil is more open with their kids about sex than I am comfortable with. Doesn't mean it's wrong.   \n\nSo yeah n t a of course. But this is the first of many issues and finding a new way to work through them will be really beneficial in the long run.  \n\nI would start with absolutely no social media posts involving your daughter ever. Ever.", "NTA.", "They don't care that their kids talk about their sex life?!?! NTA. Don't let anyone make you think this is normal and you're too uptight. This whole situation is just plain creepy and demented.", "NTA. Just bc she's ok with that stuff around her kid doesn't mean you have to allow it around yours.", "NTA what the heck", "There are a surprisingly large amount of parents monetizing their young child on tik tok and insta. Cheerleaders, swimmers, dancers, gymnasts.... it is very very gross. Really creepy.", "Thank you for this. I\u2019m a mandatory reporter and all of this was something I would report, but that point of how \u201cadult her sexual behaviour is\u201d is the thing that\u2019s giving me the icks over this.", "Creepy old men comment on this child\u2019s TikTok. 10 is not an age when kids talk about this stuff. 12 yea but again with kids not about their parents stuff.", "10-12 year olds generally don't talk about their parents fucking and what positions they do it in. If you see that as normal than there might be something wrong with you as well.", "I actually used to be a mandatory reporter in one of my previous jobs, so maybe that's why we are getting similar red flags!", "You are right! NTA!", "10-12 year olds do talk to each other about sex. It\u2019s normal to have curiosity about it and be interested in talking about it at that age.", "Of course they do. OP has the right to set her own standards, of course, and she is a soft YTA. I think, given your discomfort, you are well within your rights to insist on directly supervising all contact from here on out, especially since SIL is discounting OP's boundaries. Cutting them off entirely is pretty drastic, though. Still, cousin sounds like she is putting herself in some very creepy situations."]}
