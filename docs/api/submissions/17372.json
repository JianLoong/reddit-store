It's already a magnet for prophets and cultists who rant at people, use bullhorns to yell at people, parade with signs dooming people to hell, etc. They never actually help people in need; meanwhile, many of us who are clergy or work with NGOs will actually work with the homeless and so on, give them water, lend them an ear, point them to services, etc.  \n\n\nAnd as a disabled person who is visibly fighting cancer, I always get accosted by religious types who want to touch my bald head and do very loud, ostentatious prayers over me. Not once in the 15 years I've had this have I been cured.", "I spent the first 25 years of my life in a cult before clawing my way out, so I can say with ample experience -- there is very little you can do at this point. It's been over 4 years. She is too invested. But that doesn't mean it's hopeless.\n\nBeing a cult believer is like the worst aspects of both substance addiction and an abusive relationship. From her perspective, the emotional and spiritual high, the feeling of overwhelming love and belonging, are *addictive*. But so are the intense feelings of potential loss and disconnection if she even just *doubts*. Even if she undergoes psychological and emotional deprivation or torment, to her, it's worth it to chase those highs and avoid those lows.\n\nUsing the \"c-word\" will absolutely drive her away. You will activate all her internalized psychological defense mechanisms justifying her group's righteousness. She absolutely *will* cut you out of her life if she feels you're threatening her belonging with the group, or her husband will demand it.\n\nThe best thing you can do is be there for her in a *non-threatening* and supportive way. There's no guarantee she will ever start to draw away from the group and her husband. But if and when that happens, she will need someplace to land, and she'll be lucky to have you.\n\nIn the meantime, educate yourself on cult social dynamics and psychology. In academic circles they are more often called high-control groups, to avoid the stigma associated with \"cult\". Sorry I don't have any specific resources, but they aren't hard to find.\n\nI also recommend learning about cognitive dissonance. That's the mental conflict between a strongly held belief and contradictory observable evidence. For example, if a cult believes \"we are good and righteous and no one else can be as kind and loving as us\", observing a non-cult person being truly kind and selfless can be important contradictory evidence. Small instances of cognitive dissonance build on each other and increase the mental energy required to maintain the cult beliefs. Over time it can lead to a crack in her mental armor. The important thing is not to *directly* challenge her worldview.\n\nHope that helps. I wish you good luck, understanding, and the patience of a goddess. I'm so sorry. NTA for wanting to talk to her about it.\n\n(Edited for wording and grammar)", "  TBH, it's not going to change her or give her a wake-up call. The only thing you can do is to tell her *\"This is your thing, and you want to do this. It's not mine, but I still love you and will always consider you my friend.\"* Decline to contribute any $$.\n\nChances are, she will continue what she's doing. It may last forever; it may last a few months. This guy sounds controlling to you & me; to her, he's giving her *guidance and direction.* Until she views it differently, she will be caught up in his ventures.", "NTA, don't listen to the idiots saying YTA or \"you need a plan to get her out before you tell her\". All that is complete BS, and your friend is very much overdue for a reality check. Nobody knows what happens after that or in the near or even distant future, you need to tell her *now*.", "nta omg f that religion i wont give up my genres for any god", "NTA. I\u2019m worried she might be too far gone though.", "It is likely that she wont be able to **hear** what you have to say.\n\nYou telling her this may mean she has to cut out of her life.  Isolation is a part of cult behavior.\n\nYWNBTA but you may want to remain in the outer circle of her friends so that if / when she decided to leave, you can be there for her.", "You would be NTA for telling the truth. She is being manipulated big time, and it\u2019s disgusting.\n\nBut be prepared to get cut off from her for a very, very long time.", "I just gotta say you're giving harmful advice.The reasons people are telling her to have plans first is because by and large cult leaders are abusive. Leaving an abuser is dangerous and can get her friend killed either way her friend won't leave right now cause her friend will *not* believe op that she's in a cult.\n\nIf op just goes hard and fast on trying to get her friend out, it will most likely just result in her friend digging her heels in and leaning further into the cult. By now the cult leader has told her friend that someday her friends/family will oppose them and that means they're ungodly or evil. It's just not easy to undo all that and too hard of a push can result in her friend isolating herself from outside support. \n\nThe best op can do is **be** there, poke holes where she can and let her friend know she has a safe place with op. A harsh reality check \"might\" work? But chances are it'll make things worse.", "she might think you are, but i would distance from her husband and her if necessary if she doesnt listen to your concerns", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a deeply religious person myself. But I do understand why this type of behavior is concerning. Rapid personality change isn\u2019t common in a healthy relationship with your religion. And it seems a high control environment. \n\nThe best way in my opinion to approach this would be with love. Tell her your concerns about the amount of control it seems this man has over her life. And let her know that you\u2019re always there as a friend, if she needs help. But that you don\u2019t feel this is healthy and you don\u2019t condone what is going on with this community. And while the line of communication is always open at this time you have to distance yourself from this dynamic.", "NTA because it's obviously true, but it may not be advisable. I was raised in a culty pentecostal church that was maybe less outrightly exploitative like this, it was mostly about just controlling the existing local congregation for the income the provide via tithes and donations at a typical level, and coming straight out about it will make her defensive and more isolated. \"Outreach\" and pushing your stuff on others in culty religious groups is even more about isolating the members and making them feel separate and like the group is the only community they have or can have, sometimes exponentially moreso than whatever \"recruitment\" it's allegedly about. Leadership in these groups WANT their members to receive negative reactions or to feel \"attacked\" so they can be more isolated and dependent on the group.\n\nA better strategy would be to hang in there with her so she's not entirely isolated and be a more normal example and influence in her life, especially because she will need to have external connections if she does eventually want to get out. Asking legitimate questions and being more subtle about prompting her to use critical thinking skills without apparent judgement from you will be of more help overall.", "YWBTA.

At church women must wear skirts and dresses of appropriate fit not to short or revealing. They also go door to door trying to convert people. Then she also must wear a dress (of skirt). But at home and not doing religious activities, she\u2019s free to wear what she wants. Some of their most religious women wear jeans at home and shopping and such. Also she\u2019s allowed to listen to any music as long as it isn\u2019t satanic or promotes certain activities like getting drunk and such. Skid Row\u2019s \u201c18 and Life\u201d is acceptable because it\u2019s depicting what happens in those kinds of situations. There\u2019s other heavy metal groups from when I was a kid that\u2019s acceptable. There\u2019s no kids or sex before marriage. Unmarried couples are chaperoned on dates, even those that are in their 70\u2019s. To me this is as strict as any religion should get so I fully understand your concern. While I don\u2019t believe as my sister\u2019s religion does, there\u2019s nothing harmful to a person\u2019s mental health. It doesn\u2019t sound the same for your friend. I fully understand why you want to give the warning, but if you do, be prepared for what she might say.", "Best thing you can do is let her know your there for her if she ever needs an out."]}
