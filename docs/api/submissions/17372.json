NTA for the spirit in which you want to talk to your friend, but literally telling your friend that she married a cult leader may cause more harm than anything.

Beliefs about dress code may fall within religious freedom, so that in itself would not be a cause for alarm. However, if you believe the organization your friend's husband is involved in may be engaging in illegal or dangerous activities, I strongly suggest you contact law enforcement with your concerns. In the meantime, that means keeping the line of communication to your friend open, so please resist the temptation to just tell it like it is, no matter how satisfying that might be.", "YWBTA.
