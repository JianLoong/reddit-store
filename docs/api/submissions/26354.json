I live in Oregon and have a really cool job where I work on a little farm at my boss\u2019s house and we make herbal medicine. It\u2019s complete with a little goat pen, chickens, ducks, gardens, you name it. It is hands down the best job I\u2019ve had, and my boss is super cool and down to earth. She\u2019s also super progressive and has a lot of supports built into the job, so let\u2019s just say I\u2019m gonna be here for a while.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to my parents about the job before and they are super happy for me! I\u2019ve had a history with working jobs that made me feel absolutely terrible and where I didn\u2019t feel supported by my boss at all, so it\u2019s a super cool opportunity!\n\nAnyway, this situation happened yesterday. I got a call with my mom and we talked about some ordinary stuff: how\u2019s life, what are you doing this week, etc., but then she asked me a very strange question. She said that her and my dad want to visit me some time and have me show them around town. I said \u201cOh of course! That sounds great, [town] is a really cool spot, I\u2019ve got a lot of places to show you, you\u2019ll love it!\u201d And then she said she wants me to give her a tour of my bosses garden and our workspace, and pet my boss\u2019s goats, and get to meet my boss\u2026? I was a little taken aback, but I ended up saying \u201cUh, no, that\u2019s kinda weird, I think that\u2019s unprofessional of me.\u201d She got all quiet and then said \u201cWell, I guess we won\u2019t come up then. I don\u2019t understand how that\u2019s unprofessional at all.\u201d\n\nI explained to her that the job takes place at her house where her wife and kid lives, she doesn\u2019t let anybody on the property unless she knows them, and I just take the job seriously enough to where I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. She just said fine, and then we ended the call. Nothing happened for a little while, so I thought that was that. I then started getting texts from my sisters and my dad saying that I was a little out of line for denying my mom her request. They were saying similar things about how \u201cit\u2019s not really a big deal\u201d and \u201cjust ask your boss, she won\u2019t mind\u201d and I kept my ground. Now this may be where I\u2019m the asshole, but I told one of my sisters that it saddens me because I feel like they want to come up there not because they want to see me but so they can meet my boss and\u2026 pet her goats, apparently. My sister told my mom and now both my parents are mad at me and threatened not to visit me at all because I was being disrespectful.\n\nMy reaction to my sister may have been a little bit of an overreaction, but I still feel like it\u2019s valid for me to turn down my mom\u2019s request to meet my boss. I\u2019ve literally never heard of somebody\u2019s parents wanting to meet their boss casually, it just seems weird to me, and I want to respect my boss\u2019s wishes because it\u2019s her private property. So I ask of y\u2019all kindly, am I the asshole? I\u2019m completely open to criticism and I\u2019ll try to respond to any comments. Hope you guys have a good day.\n\nEdit: just want to clarify that my boss is in drug recovery as well and has been sober for 5 years. We don\u2019t grow drugs, and if we did I would not be working there lol.

Mom and dad won't visit if they can't go to your workplace?  That's weird.  Def seems like the animals are the main draw at this time.", "NTA. Not even for the comment made to your sister. If it was a public farm, then it wouldn't seem as weird to me. This is your bosses public property, and you are stating a very fair and very valid boundary. Also, it does just seem they want to pet the goats, because as soon as you said no to them, they were like, well now we're not coming. Again, though I can understand their curiosity, you're protecting your job that you love and your boss. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.", "NTA.\n\nYou've stated the truth: *Your boss* doesn't want anyone on her property that she doesn't know. That includes your relatives. If I were you, I'd stick to that point rather than the \"unprofessional\" one because that doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Lots of people's parents have met their bosses. Happens all the time. My parents met my bosses when I was under 25. \n\nThe fact that they are insistent on meeting her seems odd to me. There's something more to that. The fact that your mom got pissed when the idea was refused is troubling. What is their goal meeting her? Are they bigoted against LGBT? Are they hyper-religious? I'd be suspicious about their intent because they shut down the visit over it when you refused that single part. All of the other things they could do (including seeing their daughter, hello!) weren't important apparently.\n\nHold steady. The fact that they sent flying monkeys in to try and break you down is sad, IMO. You are not being disrespectful. You are an adult, you get to make decisions. Just because they don't like them doesn't mean it's disrespect. In my book they are being VERY disrespectful of you and your workplace.", "NTA all around. It\u2019s definitely weird that your parents want to meet your boss and see her property. I mean, I totally get the goat thing, goats are cool! But this feels like a weird pseudo-power move, like your parents want to inspect your working conditions to determine if it\u2019s indeed worthy. From what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like an unconventional or niche career path/opportunity. Very cool, but it\u2019s obviously a step outside of or away from corporate America (good for you tbh), so maybe they\u2019re getting nosy about it. Also NTA for what you said to your sister. Feeling discouraged and like the visit to see YOU is being distracted from by this problem  is valid. Your sisters kind of the AH for not keeping your confidence, IMO.", "NTA - work is not a family tour situation - they need to respect boundaries.", "NTA. That's just weird. I doubt your boss ever envisioned sponsoring a Take Your Parents to Work Day. What would that even look like? Would you bring them by on your day off for a 'tour' of what is essentially your boss's home? How long is the tour? Will they tell your boss stories about you? Will they get overly chatty and then complain because you dragged them away?  Nothing good can come from this.", "NTA. Your parents are being intrusive and acting super entitled. This is your livelihood. They have zero rights to intrude on it.", "NTA. If you worked in an office would they expect to meet your boss?  Of course not.", "NTA \n\nNot even remotely.\n\nAlso, you're not the one being disrespectful.\n\nI wouldn't take my mom to my boss' work/home, either. That's just weird.", "NTA\nYou set a very clear boundary and she got upset by it. If it all went according to the way you've typed it then you didn't make up the fact that she said they wouldn't come, she directly stated it on the phone. \n\n>Well, I guess we won\u2019t come up then. \n\nShe then got the rest of your family involved and got an answer she didn't like. It's okay for her to feel disappointed but that doesn't mean you did anything wrong.", "NTA. I had my dad meet my boss once when I was a teen working in a video store. Boss pulled me aside afterwards and told me \"I hired you, not your dad\" hasn't happened since.", "I think your parents want to check on you. Now, wether they are concerned for you-or overly controlling? You know them. What do you think.\n\nBut\u2026 what could it hurt to *ask* if your parents can meet your boss. \n\nOr are there things going on at the charming and happy farm that your parents might should see?

Its not a petting zoo, its not a tourist attraction.  Its the place where you work.", "NTA is not a request of you can't say no. It's an attempt at probably many years of continuous boundary breaking happening.", "NTA I'm not sure why what you said to your sister pissed them off (though it's annoying that she immediately went and told them). That's exactly what happened. As soon as you said no, your mom said she wouldn't visit. They have made it abundantly clear that they only want to visit you to pet your bosses goats. How else are you supposed to take \"oh I can't meet your boss and her goats? I'm not coming to visit then\"? Is there another way that could be interpreted? I think they're just mad they got called out on their obviously bad behavior.", "NTA. Google petting zoos near your parents and buy your mom a ticket to that.

Now it all makes sense. Maybe this bit should be edited into your post, because my first thought was that is a \\*very\\* strange request/demand from your parents.\n\nCheck with all 3 of them to see if they'd be willing to meet at a local coffee shop or restaurant. A neutral place not at your workplace/your bosses' home. This would give your Mom a chance to get a read on her and possibly settle whatever fears she has a little bit about you working in a non-traditional job in a non-traditional place under someone who is also handling post-addiction.\n\nYour parents maybe don't \\*quite\\* trust The Situation yet. Not saying they don't trust \\*you\\*; they are concerned about potential mine fields they've have invented in their heads.

It's not like you work in a corporate setting in a standard 9 to 5.\n\nCongrats to you and your boss on your continued sobriety!", "NAH \n\nThis information changes the whole dynamic. Not that they are  controlling but more concerned. Honestly when you said you make \"herbal medicine\" I wasn't sure if that was or wasn't drug-related.  I think they just want to see where you are working and who you are working for just for their own peace of mind and to make sure you are in a safe environment. \n\nAnd you are perfectly reasonable in saying you don't feel comfortable with them visiting the farm. Although given that your boss is in recovery she may be more understanding of the issues at play,", "Yes I agree. I think they are more concerned if anything, I think it may be worth asking my boss, it\u2019s just she has told me that it makes her uncomfortable to have customers at her house. We are a delivery service company, so unless she knows a customer super well, she never has them come to the house."]}
