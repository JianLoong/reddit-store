But I have that social anxiety- I'm lucky to have parents who want to pretend to try and haven't written me out of the will. I'm lucky they talk to me. They didn't disown me and shoot me.\n\nBut... Sometimes I just want the power. To be the one that hurts, instead of getting hurt. I think about the end of our relationship, when they finally give up on me. What's the last thing I want to hit them with? \n\nOf course I want them to get better. I want them to call me my name. I want them to say they love me and they're proud of me for having a career. For working with people and making a difference. I want them to have the same pride in me they have in my recovered addict sister, or my father for having five affairs.\n\nBut, no. This is their line in the sand. This is the thing they can't forgive. And sometimes, man, I just wanna be the one who walks away knowing I've given them a fraction of the pain they've given me.", "This reaction makes you feel that way because the base of who you are has never been consistently disrespected by the people you should be able to count on the most. \n\nI'm glad for you but jokes like this are hardly uncommon."]}
