It\u2019s been 2 years. I can see having a slip up here or there after 28 years of using your dead name, but it would be an obvious slip up and you\u2019d see their effort.

I've used in in professional settings when I would get an email addressing me by a nickname based on my full name. Not the nickname I use but one the sender decided they wanted to use for me (for example Sue for Susan when i have never used \"Sue\" as a sign off or in my email signature). I've replied with using their full name when they sign off with a nickname (ie, they signed off \"Mike\" and I will only address them as Michael). They eventually catch on. You are an adult and told them how you wish to be addressed. There may be some grace for unintentional slips (muscle memory) but only if they are actually trying to make the change.

Sadly, getting your point across doesn't make your parents not transphobic.

Is that really such an issue with how they are being accepting of you. This may not be popular but be respectful of your parents. Aren't you happy they accept you how you are, why not accept them the way they are and respond to your given name. Give and take.

IMO, the better approach is to try and build empathy than to build spite.\n\nI think before you started using his first name, you could have had a conversation with them about that idea \"Hey, I really don't appreciate you using my old name, that hurts me when that is use and would like to respect my wishes. I would want to think that you honor me as person more than you honor a name you gave me. Me using the name I identify with more is similar to how \\[dad\\] uses his middle name and not his first name. If everyone in the family only called him Michael, how would that make you feel? or how would \\[mom\\] feel if people  started using your maiden name instead of her married name?\"", "Malicious compliance, fantastic!", "Because it is NOT the name OP identify with!

Names are pretty important to our identities. They are literally what people call us. They are important enough that they are on every official document that we have. They are they first thing we learn to write. They are the words that follow \u201cI love you\u2026\u201d they are written on our gravestones. They are all that remains of us after we die.", "There's absolutely no reason to respect severe disrespect.", "I agree. Like it's a name, who cares. There are far more important issues in the world than a fucking made up pronoun. Be grateful they're as accepting as they are.", "I've tried having conversations with them that have ended in me crying, begging them to give it a shot. I use my new name on all my professional licensure, all my bank accounts, my driver's license, everything. It's on my insurance, anything legal and professional. I've paid to have it changed, it's on my company site. They're the only two people in the world who still use my birth name. \n\nI've tried the empathy, and honestly, I'm just tired. I don't know how else to get them to get it. But thank you for the thought out, considerate reply. I'm sure I could've found a more patient way to convey that.", "Nah, that's some bullshit and you know it. Would you accept being called the wrong name repeatedly and intentionally by someone? Or someone referring to you as she if you're a he?

There are far more important issues in the world than expecting parents to love their kids as they are unconditionally without throwing a tantrum when those kids turn out not to fit the parents' preferred mold. Who cares if you feel rejected or unloved? You matter less than your parents' attachment to THEIR chosen name and the pronouns THEY chose for you.\"\n\nThere, fixed it for you.", "> Like it's a name, who cares.\n\nThen it shouldn't be hard to use the correct one.", "With this post I feel it adds more context. Your original post it sounded like this may have been earlier on in your transition, so it's almost more forgivable for older people \"set in their ways\" to have a hard time changing something as drastic as their child's name.\n\nI think it's not always ok to be petty and stoop to other people's level, but this may be something that pushes them over the edge of understanding how hurtful it is to you. \"taste of your own medicine\" might be a little harsh but \"I'm trying to make you understand how hurtful it is and I feel like this may be the only way\"", "OP when your dad left the room, we\u2019re you able to notice his emotions? Like did he angrily get up and leave or was it more like he was shocked. \n\nI only ask because if it was the later, it may have been that it finally clicked with your dad and he\u2019s realized what he\u2019s done to you. \n\nIf it was the former, well, I think the other comments have covered that enough.", "I frankly don't give a shit what I'm called, tbh. Because again, it's not a big deal. Just because you choose to change your name doesn't mean others have to abide by that.", "Nah. I said what I said. You fixed nothing.", "No, they don't have to abide by it. But it's generally considered disrespectful to not do so.", "In other words, you don't think it's necessary for parents to love the child they have, as long as they make a show of loving the pretend child they wanted and demand the real child they have force him or herself into the role of that pretend child.\n\nI bet you'd care if your loved ones demanded to call you by the other sex's pronouns and a name they'd chosen for a child of the other sex, and refused to acknowledge that that was not who you were."]}
