Either you support what she wants or you don\u2019t. She bought the car that she wanted, so get on board.\n\nAlso, the fact that you think you guys are super close, but your daughter had to work up the nerve to tell you she bought a car with her own money makes me think she\u2019s used to walking on eggshells around you. That\u2019s not normal to be that nervous to tell you something that quite frankly isn\u2019t really your business. \n\n> I believe that if she wanted this independence she should have to deal with it in its entirety.\n\nOh, we\u2019re back to the mind games. You want her so independent, but yet you\u2019re appalled that she went and did an adult thing on her own.

I think your own perception of how supportive you are may be different from your daughter's, and from what your actions demonstrate.", "YTA - Your daughter is an adult and can make her own decisions, however you should be more concerned as to why she didn't tell you for a week as to me it indicates that she was scared to tell you as she knew your reaction would be negative.", "Y\u2019all get a load of this [from OP\u2019s other now deleted post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14i3ua7/aita_for_sending_my_daughters_boyfriend_away_to/). He and his daughter aren\u2019t close. In fact he describes her behavior towards him as vindictive. \n\n>My daughter is doing well enough in her studies, and she met a boyfriend who grew up in the province she goes to university in. However, as she stayed in dorms, she was to come home for the summer. She (F19) is always on her phone, rolls her eyes at me, and avoids spending time with the family. While vindictive towards me, I still want to make my daughter happy so I humored her idea of coming home for the summer and bringing her new boyfriend.\n\n\n>I relented because I knew my daughter was set on this, and my wife was on her side. I did not want more tension between us but I regret allowing the boyfriend a place to stay in my house. For one thing, he constantly cites his anxiety/depression and autism as factors in his social behavior, but I believe it is disrespectful not to be addressed properly. I told him he should be more diligent about making eye contact when he speaks to me, and he refuses to do it. He constantly encourages my daughter to speak on mental health issues. He talks about his own family\u2019s religion and political ideology at the dinner table; poor manners. He constantly attempts to undermine my authority. I had become incredibly fed up with things like his late bedtimes or him using my blender to make protein shakes every day. I do not think it is appropriate for him to have made himself so comfortable in my house. He and my daughter disappear out of the house for hours at a time which makes me worry for her safety when it gets late.\n\n\n>My daughter failed to immediately open her bedroom door one evening. Of course I knew what was going on. I remind her the rule is to keep the door open and she scoffs. It was the last straw. I think it is irresponsible of me to let this boy stay here and do whatever he wants with my daughter, so I will take the measures needed. That night, I went down to the basement room I set aside for the boyfriend and told him to get the hell out of my house before I was awake for work the next morning and forbade him from going upstairs again. Around 7:30am, he drives home after being given 7 entire hours to pack. My daughter is livid I kicked out her boyfriend without letting him say goodbye to her, and my wife is upset I acted unilaterally. I explained that as a father I get to make choices for my daughter\u2019s safety and I was fed up with her ungrateful house guest. They mentioned the state his car was in, to which I reminded them it is his responsibility to perform the necessary maintenance.It is a basic element of owning a car, and I will not apologize for expecting that. I do not believe it was wrong to evict the boyfriend when he had been nothing but a bad influence on my daughter and I was sick of putting up with the disrespect of our house rules and a reasonable curfew of 10pm. My daughter refuses to speak to me even though I did this to protect her. Was I wrong for using my paternal authority to make a choice that is better for my family?", "YTA. You just have to make it all about you. Did your daughter make the best decision ? Maybe not.

Sounds like your daughter has realised not all men are insecure, controlling and misogynistic AHs like her dad and has the strength to step outside your ridiculous world view. Keep going and you won't have to worry about any of this, as she'll soon stop coming home. Poor little woman, doesn't know her own mind, despite being an adult, working and educating herself (call it a wild guess, but more educated than you!?), And managed to budget well enough on minimum wage to buy a car. You talk so much about her making mistakes, I presume that's projection, and how you actually feel about your own life. I'm so proud of your daughter, for standing up to you and putting herself first. She's going to do great.

You say you have a good relationship but if she had to \u201cwork up the nerve\u201d to tell you about the car, you don\u2019t have as good of a relationship as you think. You keep saying you would have helped her pay for a better car. That would not have been HER car. You would have helped pay for it so that you could still control her. \u201cI helped you pay for the car so I say where you can drive it\u201d She knew this and got her own car so she could do what she wanted without you pulling that card on her. Grow up and accept that your daughter is growing up and making her own choices. She\u2019s 19 ffs. She\u2019s not 16. You shouldn\u2019t be punishing her for making a brave choice on her own. You should be proud of her. I feel bad for her.\n\nEdit to add: In a few years when she moves out and never speaks to you again or goes very low contact, I want you to remember this moment. You have a very skewed perspective on your relationship with your daughter and with life in general. Grow up.", "YTA for getting unnecessarily offended by your daughter\u2019s attempts to spread her wings and make independent choices.

Incomes changes once back at college so money for gas then.", ">  i don\u2019t know what she\u2019s hiding that would require an entirely separate car\n\nWhy do you think she\u2019s hiding *anything*? Has she ever been in any real trouble before? You\u2019re acting like she\u2019s secretly prepping to sell dope out of her beater car. Unless she\u2019s given you legitimate cause to worry in the past, you\u2019re being ridiculous. If you\u2019re this overbearing about things, no wonder she didn\u2019t want to tell you about the car. No one needs a lecture and a full blown adult getting their knickers in a twist every time someone makes a decision they wouldn\u2019t have made.", "You claim to give her free reign and trust her to be smart but turn around and question her purchase of a car then punish her by withdrawing your support of her because it isn't the decision you would have made had you been asked. Even though she is now asking for help in the for of car access until the end of summer. That's not free reign. \n\nAlso, the fact that she needed to work up the courage to tell you about the car tells you a lot about how little trust and free reign you give her. And how you are not as close as you are telling yourself you are. If you don't correct course you'll end up with a kid that doesn't tell you anything. \n\nI took a 3 week trip, on my own, to a totally different continent and my mother only found out by accident. I love her but she is on a diet of limited information. Because her reactions to my news/choices is always judgy even though she would claim that she is supportive. Learn from this OP and have a conversation with your kid about why she felt she needed to work up the courage to tell you this and genuinely listen to her answers so you can make your relationship better.", "She's hiding from you because you're overly critical. She did something on her own and you're basically treating her like she's mentally unstable liar who and charting the course of her life being in the gutter . Why are you so defensive over her making decisions that aren't your decisions? How often have have you come to conclusions like this the second she makes unapproved decisions? Do you routinely catastrophise her life just because you think you know better?", "Nothing. You don't see why she wants to be independent, but that's just what young adults do. You may think you're the coolest best parent in the world, and maybe you are, but your daughter will want her own life regardless. You need to accept that.", "She's 19. She's an adult. She doesn't need you to give her free reign. She's no longer a minor.", "So your daughter bought a bang-up car but legally should still be road-worthy (thus, able to be insured). Amongst other insecurities / assumption you have, you also:\n\n>do not want to bail her out when the car breaks down because she did not make a good decision\n\nI'm amazed how you are not realizing:\n\n* The car purchase is your daughter version of announcing to the world she feels she is ready to be an adult \n* The reason why she is hiding this from you is because she fully expect you to react exactly how you did\n* Because she made the \"bad decision\" of getting the Lexus without your knowledge you unanimously decide that she will not get to drive as revenge\n\nInstead of:\n\n* Celebrating her first big ticket purchase\n* Have a heart-to-heart talk on why you were not consulted if this is so important to you\n* Heads-up her on potential issues she will face while driving this car. And until she can fully pay for her gas, car usage should only limit for important matters", "Jesus you sound like my mom when I was her age. You should know a couple things if you plan on keeping a relationship with your daughter as she becomes an adult. I'm 31 and really close with my mom now. That started maybe 2-3 years ago. From the ages of 18 to 29 I basically didn't talk to my mom outside of occasional phone calls and holidays. I definitely never traveled to see her, came home for holidays, didn't introduce friends or partners, and there were several year+ long periods we didn't talk at all. It all changed when she decided to.\n  \nI can tell you love your kid and really really want them to have it better and easier than you did. I'm also the child of a single parent so I know how that is playing in and some people really won't understand. You're gunna get a bunch more shit here than you deserve because frankly single parent and child dynamics are different.\n  \nYou're gunna push her away like this and none of your behaviors are helping. Others are trying to argue against your logic and you're just fighting instead of listening. I'm not going to try.\n  \nLook at the reality. 19, full time, used but even a banged up Lexus isn't cheap. Inspection, registration. Fuck me I couldn't have gotten all of that handled at her age and I lived with my ex-wife at the time. And she budgeted! She knew how much money she had and didn't have and did the adult thing where she delayed the want of driving her new car because she didn't have gas. \n\nAnd you're mad. Hopefully you're mad because you're scared. She just popped up and showed you how much her dependence on you is shrinking, but you know if she's on her own now making big choices without you then she'll probably get smacked in the face by life and it's tricky hidden consequences. So you're scared and mad and lashing out trying to control the situation before damage gets done.\n  \nAnd that behavior is why when I bought my first car at her age I was in Virginia and my mother Missouri. She heard about it 3 weeks later. From someone else not me. I was busy working a full time job and getting married to an abusive woman. Yeah those consequences you're worried about her facing alone? She will face them alone if you keep acting like this.\n  \nSorry. There's some angst in there that you don't deserve. I'm still sorting through my emotions on it today. My point is I see it's coming from love but it's not helping. It's actively causing harm. Hopefully you won't be just like my mother and you'll actually read this as advice instead of an attack.", "Sounds like an okay car for a relatively new driver to have. Less panic from them if they clip a bollard or open a door too fast next to a brick wall.", "1. Scratched paint is not a safety issue.\n\n1.5. Neither are foggy headlights (which can be cleaned in 5 minutes with baking soda and vinegar)\n\n2 If the headlight seal was cracked it wouldn't be certifiable, more than likely just weathering damage.\n\n3 Rust near the wheel wells isn't a concern as long as the frame is fine.\n\nNothing about this car sounds unsafe.", "I think you just wanted to be in charge of her decision, so really, your decision. You child is growing up and wanted to make her own decision and choices. Honestly, it's better that she has a beat up car for a 1st car. No big deal if she hits a garbage can trying to park it,  or it gets a scratch. If you want to be supportive give her some gas money.", "So you are no more knowledgeable than your daughter, you claim you want her to be independent, and yet you shit all over the first major thing she\u2019s chosen to do as an adult, when you have zero qualifications to make a more informed decision than she does other than you\u2019ve managed to be alive longer.", "Your daughter is also an adult. It's time to put the helicopter away.", "I think you wanted to control her, and you can\u2019t. That\u2019s what your real problem here is. \n\nAnother commenter posted details from the post where you kicked her boyfriend out of your house\u2026. Again that was about you having control. \n\nYou are going to lose your daughter, I think the damage is already done tbh. Best thing you could do now is try therapy. \n\nOh and real whiff of misogyny coming from you as well OP\n\nYTA", "Right, forgot that Americans don't save up money.", "she\u2019s a \u201cgood kid\u201d but I don\u2019t like her boyfriend. I am worried she will drive him around everywhere and sacrifice her education to play house.", "Wow. You have absolutely zero faith in your daughter. You say she goes to school out of state. For all you know she\u2019s already secretly dropped out and is shacking up with this boy. I mean, come on. Do you think so little of your daughter\u2019s intelligence that you think she bought a car to chauffeur her out of state boyfriend around all day to the point that it would impact her college education?", "So you're not confident in the way YOU raised her?", "You really can't say a good word about your daughter can you? The meaner you are to her the more she is going to run to him. I hope you know this", "OP, you're acting exactly like my abusive mom. I constantly walked on eggshells, and even though I'm a good kid, she always thinks the worst of me. More so, when I started dating my bf and seeing how terrible she was. She told me I can't make it on my own and etc. I gained a full-on independence and went no contact.", "True this!!!!"]}
