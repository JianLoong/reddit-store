There\u2019s a special place in hell for people who reserve loungers with their hotel towels.", "NTA! Some people!", "NTA. I absolutely hate when people do this at resorts and pools.", "You didn't do anything wrong. Hey it was a perfect lesson to teach your kid that sometimes people are just weird and wrong.", "NTA. This type of behavior is why I stopped going on cruises.", "NTA", "I had this happen to me in Florida \ud83d\ude43 staff saw us looking for chairs and were removing things from \u201csaved seats\u201d right at that moment and offered them to us. TWO HOURS LATER the people show up and start screaming at me. Claimed I was lying that staff moved their stuff. The daughter of the group proceeded to dump a soda in my 4 months old car seat/stroller combo. Hotel gave us a free private cabana for the next day as an apology which was great until we realized they also gave the awful family one right next to us \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab", "People like this are the bane of resorts and cruise ships the world over.

Bueller you're my hero", "NTA but next time, you don't have to answer these people.... you didn't do anything wrong.  I hope your kiddo is ok!

Yelling profanities in front of your kid, an even bigger no.  Moving someone else's stuff, even if you think it's just a hotel towel, any equally big no.  You should have had the resort staff do it.  If they refuse, get the manager and continue escalating until they resolve the situation and enforce their own rules.  You could find yourself in loads of trouble if the other party claims their wallet, phone or other valuables were in with the towels, especially if you are a visiting a foreign country... these aren't games you should play.", "ESH. You should have gotten a staff member to remove the \u201cpersonal items\u201d not done it yourself, and Jim is also thr AH for obvious reasons.", "Unpopular opinion, but ESH. You\u2019re on vacation. Relax and enjoy yourself. No need to go out of your way to be a jerk.

NTA. I don't want to argue about something I don't care about with someone who just doesn't need my attention either.

This sounds awful. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that", "Sure thing. Thanks for sharing your opinion", "I tried. I talked to staff about it. Said they won\u2019t remove personal belongings and said I was free to do so if I choose. Basically telling me that they will not be enforcing the rule of not reserving seats with personal belongings and removing unattended belongings. I understand why. Not worth it for a lower level employee of a big hotel chain. They don\u2019t want to lose their job over someone pitching a fit and calling their manager. Thanks for sharing your opinion.", "But that's why they do it. It's part of their manipulation technique to make you feel ikky about the whole situation.

You are smarter than that guy, though. And you are kinder than he knows how to be. Always remember that acting out in public is a choice - not your only option.*\n\nMeh.

Plus, you'd probably have your personal stuff there as well if you came to use the pool. \n\nThis is strictly about towels only and a guest being nowhere to be found for 2 hours, not swimming in the pool.", "I\u2019d let the hotel staff know that you followed the instructions and you were abused by a fellow guest in front of your child. Their policy and lack of enforcement gets rule following guests verbally abused\u2026", "This attitude by the staff is why I love Jamaicans", "You were so in the right to do this.

They were dry, unused *hotel* towels. They might have grabbed them and set them there initially, but they never used them, so they gave up any claims of \"ownership\" over said towels when they abandoned them for hours on the chairs.

I\u2019d have shrugged and said \u201cI don\u2019t know, it was free when I got here. Maybe ask the hotel staff if they moved it.\u201d", "Outside of like super obvious AH moves like grabbing someone's towel off their waist and throwing it in the ocean, I would say 0% chance it counts", "It's this. Definitely this.", "But they were the hotel's towels, not personal property.  I've never been to a resort with cabanas where you check out towels and can't just grab another.  There's usually just a bin by the exists of the pool area.

I really don\u2019t care just thought I\u2019d specify. But no. I did not pay any money for a reservation of a cabana.

That's weird.", "Yeah, who\u2019s to say the towels weren\u2019t staged there by hotel staff as a courtesy for their guests?", "I\u2019m not though", "Right, that\u2019s what I figured. So neither of you paid to reserve, neither had any entitlement to it, and his stuff was there first. Just saying. \n\nAgain, as I said above, if it was just hotel towels and had been 2 hours, I probably would have done the same! \n\nI don\u2019t judge you much for taking it, but you have a lot of attitude and sense of entitlement when he had just as much right to it as you did (arguably more since his stuff was there first) \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If someone rented a truck and parked it in front of your driveway, yes you could have it towed.

This is a well known and common thing to do. You don't have to own the car or the city property it is parked in to call in a tow. And they would absolutely take the car because then they get paid.", "Apparently guests at this hotel have the delegated authority to move unattended hotel towels.\n\nSo... Yes.\n\nWhy are you so deeply invested in this trivial issue? You're the asshole from the story, aren't you? Dude, go enjoy your vacation."]}
