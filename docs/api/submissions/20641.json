My first response would be to say take the baby and get out, but I don\u2019t know the legal ramifications of that. And/or ask for a three-day involuntary psych hold based on your wife\u2019s threats to kill herself and the baby. Ask Reddit legal (or wherever; I\u2019m trying to think of anonymous places you can ask for help) for types of resources in your community you can access. \n\nThe rest is a shit show, sure, but people do f\u2019d up stuff when life is a shitshow; and the above things are the most pressing. \n\nI\u2019m not judging this.

If I were OP, I would have taken both kids and left without coming back.", "Sorry\u2026but demanding that she stop interacting with a family member who was HARMING his child\u2026the child she agreed to love and be responsible for (since he existed prior to their marriage) is not asking to much of a partner. Racism is abuse. Full. Stop. Let\u2019s stop acting like it\u2019s not. A broken clock is right twice a day. OP is an asshole but not for expecting his wife to make her family respect the child she agreed to help raise. She is also an abusive asshole.", "Read his previous posts. They saw a couple\u2019s therapist one time. She is doing nothing to take care of herself and is a danger to herself and the baby. She needs professional help and someone needs to take that baby away from her.", "And if anything happened to your child while in her care? 1000x worse.", "But he's trying to divorce her and she's refusing. When you're done with someone you are done. He's at least staying with her to help her out which is more than most people would do when their spouse is okay with a 6-year-old being verbally abused. OP clearly needs to take a break from ANY relationships and get his shit together but stb ex-wife isn't any better. Maybe just me but I would go nuclear if anyone was subjecting my bi-racial child to racists.", "Cheating is breaking the monogamy promise. There was none once he broke up with her. I'm sorry to inform you that you can't force anyone to have a relationship with you. Married or not.\nYour approach would be an ultimate demise to all married victims of DV. But to realize that you'd have to stop projecting yourself into this situation.\n\nYou are biased by the newborn and PPD.\nThe rest is some uneducated bs. My advice - get a lawyer in case you're divorcing.", "Him not wanting his newborn to lose their other parent to suicide doesn't make the wife a saint. You know that, right?", "She subjected her stepson to her father's presence tho. If she wants to see him the least she could do is visiting him or meeting in a public place so the kid doesn't have to be racially abused.", "Love the racism apologism here.  No.  You can either love your stepchild or you can love a man who hates them.  You can't do both.  No wonder she's miserable, someone is actually making her face either her bullshit or its consequences for once in her life.", "Yeah. She broke down and so he is taking care of her. They're separated but not divorce and he can't move out yet from what he has posted.", "That\u2019s a lot of assumptions you\u2019re making. Of course we can\u2019t know what\u2019s truly going on but I\u2019ve read OP\u2019s post history and am not sure where you\u2019re getting that he\u2019s a control freak or that he doesn\u2019t give a shit about his baby. Seems like a strangely strong stance to take with very limited info. Also, you aren\u2019t even acknowledging the reason OP doesn\u2019t want the father around, it\u2019s a pretty friggin good one.", "I honestly do not understand why OP didn't just leave before getting her pregnant. His lack of care towards his youngest child is disturbing. Prior issues aside, he absolutely is TA for leaving his child with the mother that has PPD. It's as simple as that.", "Separated is not divorced. It\u2019s still trash to impregnate someone else when you are still legally married.", "Or he could have just stayed to make sure his other child wasn't in danger rather than relying on someone else. If I was being verbally abused when trying to help someone you can bet it wouldn't enter my mind to call their ahole husband especially when he decided to get another woman pregnant.", "Exactly, the wife is playing a game & she can apparently just do whatever she wants with no consequences.", "I expect his children to be posting on r/raisedbynarcissists in the near future.\nFucking hell", "Not saying her actions are great, but OP even made a post before this went down about how he wanted to dovorce her while she was pregnant. FIL also didn't say anything directly to his daughter's stepson, so IDK if the hiding has anything to do with it. There are detaild missing but that doesn't make it any better tbf.", "FIL did not abuse the kids, OP would have mentioned it. Again, not saying the FIL in justified in any capacity. But let's not call apple oranges. She's not an abusive asshole, it sounds like OP was alreayd distancing himself from her prior to her letting the FIL see the boys, meanin she was probably already not fully there mentally both because of pregnancy and, oh would you look at that, OP.\n\nAgain, it was a dick move of her, but that doesn't mean she's an asshole.\n\nOP, however, shows behavior consistent with being an asshole. Basically looking for a reason to break up with his pregnant wife, finding it, jumping on it rather than talking to wife about why she'w letting her father in again, and then proceeded to have sex with his ex AND get her pregnant with less than a month between the baby being in a womb and the baby being born. He then leaves the baby with his mentally ill wife, doesn't hire a sitter and instead pawns off parental responsibility on a friend ... He is entitled and wants grace when he won't give it, full stop. I wonder why he broke up with his first wife who he also impregnated, now twice. He has main character syndrome.", "It\u2019s not necessarily best practice for PPD to \u201ctake the baby away from her\u201d and could make things worse - she needs professional help urgently but if she\u2019s that sick she won\u2019t be able to take care of herself. OP needs to step up and speak to her doctor about getting her help.", "you keep falling back to that projecting line, which sounds like you're the one projecting  \n\n\nadultery has nothing to do with a \"monogamy promise\"  if you don't know what you're talking about, it's better to remain silent \n\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/adultery", "Him keeping the wife secluded and pawning her off on family friends while he goes out to pool parties and fucks his ex instead of trying to get her professional help *also* makes him an AH. You know that, right?", ">Him not wanting his newborn to lose their other parent to suicide doesn't make the wife a saint.\n\nThis quite literally makes *no sense*... you know that, right?", "Considering his comments on here, I\u2019m honestly doubting if he\u2019s telling the truth on her father being racist or not.", "Well, before she got pregnant, she had cut contact with her father! It was after she got pregnant that she started reaching out to her father again, and then, when the baby was a week old, OP came home from running errands to find his racist FIL in the house, holding their baby, while his Black older son was also in the house. That's when he left.", "I'm not defending that. Although, if we're ranking relative levels of trashiness, I'd say that intentionally exposing a young Black child to one's racist father is worse.", ">Or he could have just stayed to make sure his other child wasn't in danger rather than relying on someone else.  \n\nSo he can never leave the house now?", "Or, perhaps, she has a mental illness that means, sadly, she is not cognitively in a place where she can make decisions that are in anyone's best interest. OP doesn't have to simply acquiesce & let her illness steer the ship of their lives but if he genuinely is concerned about her behaviour (and her inability to act in a way that is medically necessary) then he has a moral & (when it comes to his son), a legal obligation to do whatever he can to make sure that she gets the help she needs AND/OR move forward in a way to protect his child. \n\n If she is resistant to treatment, what has he done (besides fall in bed with another person) to have her examined by professionals who could possibly admit her to the hospital. PPD & PPP are 100% no joke & I appreciate that he is unhappy in his current circumstances, but there's a helpless child caught betwixt. This is where the rubber meets the proverbial road & OP needs to exhaust ALL efforts to get her the help she needs. Perhaps by reaching out to her family & having a real conversation with his wife's father about his concerns.\n\n Either way, OP is the AH here, for multiple reasons. His life doesn't have to stay connected to his wife's, long term, but this is not a scenario where he can nope out of it, without putting the work in to deal with the root causes of why things have gone so off the rails, & in doing so,  making sure his child is safe.", "If you read his comments on his previous posts, you\u2019ll see that he did say overtly racist things about his older son (asked if his bio mom was in prison, did she ever wash her hair etc.)\n\nI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re hell-bent on defending racist people.\n\nAlso, what did FIL say/do to make his son go hide and cry?", "She needs inpatient care and they don\u2019t let you keep a baby with you in the psych ward.", "Yes. She is manipulating you.", "Yes. It\u2019s called emotional manipulation. People do it all time.  How many years do you intend to wait if she doesn\u2019t want to get help? You think she\u2019s trying when she keeps switching therapist after two sessions. The therapist have probably already figured out what\u2019s going on which is why she only sees them for two sessions", "I\u2019m certainly not excusing her father\u2019s behavior, or here\u2019s for that matter, but I do understand having a fragile mental and emotional state when your husband tells you he wants to divorce you while pregnant, gets another woman pregnant 3 weeks after you give birth and are dealing with PPD and PPA all the while leaving you at home watching his son and the newborn. If he wants to divorce her then fine, but the way he\u2019s going about it is not helpful to her or him.", "I think you know you can end it.\n\nAnd no cultural differences involved, just different level of self-esteem and different approach to personal freedom.\n\nI'd rather not have all victims of DV chained to their abusive spouse for years of prolonged and maliciously obstructed divorce proceedings so you can force keep a man you couldn't keep at will. Look loooooong in the mirror of this post. Eot.", "Yeah, because we discussed his marital asset division and further divorce proceedings...\n\nLet me introduce you to reality, where in common understanding cheating is breaking the monogamy deal you have with a person (or a set non-monogamy rules partnera decided to have). We discussed if a random person on Reddit can call OP a cheater in situation described in OP post history. \n\nAnd you're right, I was wrong.\nYou got confused , probably didnt even get the basic information beyond few keywords (married, wife, PPD, newborn, sex with ex, accidental pregnancy) and your lazy brain skipped to first conclusion you came up with. I was mistaken that you actually bothered to get the info, yet you dismissed it for your own protection. I was wrong. You were just ignorant. My apologies for mistaking you for someone who reads before commenting. My bad. Eot as you can probably guess at this point. Have a nice day.", "It doesn't help that his posts are full of contradictions. I'm falling out of love with my pregnant wife. I love my wife and I don't want to leave and I have snot and tears all over me. It sure didn't take him long to start hooking up with someone else. It definitely didn't take him long to leave a woman with PPD alone with his infant child when his older child has his mother to look after him instead of him being near the racist father in law. The whole thing is just a mess and OP is not making it any easier on any of them. The 6 year old absolutely will have some understanding of what's happening. Sounds like OP needs to grow up and start thinking about the safety of his youngest child, how he will move out and how he is going to apply for custody. \n\nLiterally none of that takes away from the fact he left his infant child in the care of someone who could be a danger though.", "I didn't, but will from now on. I have a terrible habit of reading before commenting which takes time which I don't want to get wasted on ignorants. Selfish of me to desire an inspiring and thoughtful discussion.\n\nBtw, it's so cute you tried to gang up on me with a girl half your age :D\nSo sweet of you! You made my day!"]}
