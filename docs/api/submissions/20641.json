Why didn't you ask your wife if she wanted your friend's wife to come over before asking?

My first response would be to say take the baby and get out, but I don\u2019t know the legal ramifications of that. And/or ask for a three-day involuntary psych hold based on your wife\u2019s threats to kill herself and the baby. Ask Reddit legal (or wherever; I\u2019m trying to think of anonymous places you can ask for help) for types of resources in your community you can access. \n\nThe rest is a shit show, sure, but people do f\u2019d up stuff when life is a shitshow; and the above things are the most pressing. \n\nI\u2019m not judging this.

I asked for a divorce because she allowed her racist father to have access to my child. 2. My friends offered to help us, multiple times. 3. I have tried to get my wife help, but she said she will only get better if I change my mind about the divorce, which never will.", "Pull some quotes to back up your version then.", "Well, that's got nothing to do with it. Our relationship is already over.", "My wife's friend offered to stay with her for the day. She didn't tell me she was going to leave and not tell me. If she had told me she was leaving I would have come back.", "She goes, but she never sticks with one person for more than two sessions.", "There's nothing I can do about that. I can't stay in a marriage with someone who lied to me about her values. Five hours.", "Yeah, she and her husband keep telling me to just leave, that she'll never get better with me there, because her illness is what is keeping me there and she wants me to stay. They keep telling me to remove myself and the baby from the home, and that she will either have to put herself back together or check herself into psychiatric care, but I am worried that something would happen to her.\n\nHowever, I feel like it was dishonest of her to claim she would stay and then immediately leave, tricking me into doing what she wanted. Not to mention, she was wrong. My wife didn't get help or put herself together. She trashed the place and didn't eat anything.", "My wife won't tell me. According to my wife's friend, she told her they needed to have a serious conversation about things, that she needed to stop acting like a child, because no one is going to treat her like a child. Then my wife exploded at her.", "I just don't think you have any say over who someone sleeps with once they've already broken up with you.", "Look at you, all defensive and trying to gaslight the internet into believing your bullshit \ud83e\udd23", "He says it\u2019s post partum and anxiety. Oh and he got his ex pregnant as well which won\u2019t help.\nEdit - spelling.", "She talks to therapists, but she won't talk to anymore psychiatrists, because she said the first one said she was crazy. I don't think she actually said that, but I wasn't in the room.", "I'm white.", "This is my wife, not my child. I cannot force her to see anyone she doesn't want to see. She hasn't been legally declared incompetent. Even if she were, I couldn't be her power of attorney, because we are getting divorced.", "We aren't together anymore. Obviously getting someone pregnant was a mistake, but we broke up. I have the right to seek companionship elsewhere. Also, that has nothing to do with my post, which is about my argument with her friend for leaving without calling me after saying she would watch her.", "I may have missed this but is she getting any help for her ppd?", "OP, YOU are making it your life by trying to keep your foot in two shoes, thinking it somehow absolves you for knocking up your ex/baby-mama while you are still living together with your soon-to-be-ex-sick-wife. Wowza, what a sentence this is, yet factually correct.\n\nYou are soon going to have 3 children, and none of them will ever even know a solid familial unit. Bravo, chapeau! \nYou are winning at life there, champ! \n\nYour life is a mess. You are NOT innocent in this, except for wanting to protect your firstborn from your ex-FIL's racism. That was one good decision you made. But the rest... yeeeesh. Stop deflecting, and start taking responsibility. \n\nFirst of all, if you are going to divorce your wife, which you say is absolutely your priority, then FUCKING DO IT. Move out, BRING THE BABY WITH YOU, call an ambulance, and let the chips fall where they may. You can't make your soon-to-be-ex wife better, so the kindest thing you can possibly do is remove yourself from the situation and alert the authorities. You can't fix her, the only thing you can do is getting her professional help.\n\nYes, this is cold. Yes, if things go sideways you will be blaming yourself. It is what it is. The current situation is untainable. But YOU have three children to think of, your priority should be making sure the baby is safe... and no, the baby is not safe in the current situation. You have to choose between the baby's safety and the risk that the mother will go through with her threats.", "[removed]", "Waah, waah, waah.  Poor you.", "Geez if only someone hadn't made a baby (a life might I add) irresponsibly, oh geez what a damn shame that can't be prevented huh.", "And yet you still left her?", "She was told by your wife to leave her house and life. The friend was honoring that by not getting more involved in your wife\u2019s life", "okay, but you understand if your adult wife can't be left alone without someone notifying you, that's a big problem, right? and a responsibility that shouldn't have been put on a friend.", "Oh, I think I remember that post... The one where you two cut off contact with Fil as he was racist and your wife went behind your back and allowed contact", "What did you expect asking for a divorce when she was pregnant? Did you even try and work through why she reconnected with her father. Does she feel alienated from her family and alone while\nYou\u2019re out screwing your first baby\u2019s mom? Marriage is supposed to be forever- can you honestly say you tried everything to make it work? Or did you just drop her once you found out she reconnected with her father?", "Dude no one\u2019s got sympathy for you. You ended your marriage and knocked up your original baby mama in less than 6 weeks", "Probably because they tell her what she needs to hear and not what she wants to hear. \n\nI\u2019m going with YTA for going off on her now ex friend like that. If she\u2019s not willing to try and help herself and cuss out her friends why should they extend an effort? Sounds like she wants to stay miserable and a victim. Good luck dude.", "How did she lie to you about her values?", "Remove your children from that situation and call an ambulance for her, let her be evaluated by a professional, if she's a danger they'll keep her. You really aren't helping her at this point, you are just torturing yourself and your kids, and by extension her. Your friend isn't an asshole for leaving a bad situation either, you should learn from your friend.", "The friend didn't claim she would stay then immediately leave to trick you. She left because, according to your version of events, your wife screamed at her and told her to go. \n\nAlso, your friend does not mean \"if you leave her for a day, she'll have to sort herself out or check herself in for care.\" She means that you should remove yourself and your child from the situation *for the long-term.* You're not actually helping your wife. You're enabling, and also putting your baby in danger by leaving them with someone who has threatened to harm themselves and potentially also the child if you leave her alone.\n\nInstead of taking responsibility for your own actions and doing the right but difficult thing, you've continued to wallow in self-pity and guilt, blame others for your problems, and refuse to listen to good advice from people who care about you. Your friend is not the asshole here. She's just rightly fed up with both of you.", "The friend and her husband are 100% right. That situation is not safe for your baby.", "Honestly\u2026 I kind of feel like that makes her and you NTA. Some people don\u2019t respond well to \u201ctough love\u201d as it is, but that almost comes across as condescending.", "But you\u2019re *not* broken up, you\u2019re still legally married. You should have at the absolute least had the decency to use protection until the divorce was finalised.", "Dude, your life is a shit show and not because of your wife... Having a new baby and knocking up different woman while not being divorced?!? You are a bad joke.\n\nYTA", "I'm gaslighting you? You're literally making things up. If it happened the way you said, present your source.", "Reading your post history, I really feel for you. What a ride. Can you leave and get custody of the baby? She sounds like she needs 24 hour care", "Then take her to the hospital and get her admitted- she has stated she is not safe by herself or with the baby", "My mistake. You mentioned your son was black so I wrongly assumed. That\u2019s on me", "And if you\u2019re worried about someone\u2019s mental health to the point you think they\u2019re a danger to themselves, you don\u2019t dump a divorce and then immediate pregnancy on them", "Your wife told her to get out of her life. The friend did so", "I wish I could upvote this more, I hope op sees it. \n\nOp, your biggest priority is getting yourself and both of your children out of that situation. \nYour second priority is getting a good lawyer to limit her access to the baby until such time as she receives treatment and is better.", "This should be the top comment!", "Is that right? So tell me then, what would you have done?", "Are you talking about left her like left the relationship? Or left her like left her at the house? Because for the first one, yes, we still aren't going to stay together. For the second, I left her with her friend who said she would watch her.", "She didn't just allow contact, she exposed my son to him. I will never want to be in a relationship with her ever again, no matter what.", "I'm not going over all of this again. It's all been discussed.

Be realistic. The mental health system in this country is garbage. Do you really honestly believe they'll help her? You hear horror stories every day about people being abused at inpatient facilities. How am I supposed to risk that happening to her?", "And if something happens to her? Then what? \"Oops, guess that didn't work\" wouldn't really cut it.", "If I leave her alone and something happens to her, I'll never forgive myself.

I asked for the divorce first.", "I don't know man it seems really easy not to cheat? Or not leave your postpartum wife home alone while you go on a fun trip? To leave a relationship because you're no longer in love? There were so many chances to be a decent person, and somehow, you managed to make the exact wrong decision each and every time. To be frank, the level of \"it's not my fault my dick fell into my ex repeatedly\" makes me think you're a troll. On the off chance you're real, you should consider that your decision-making skills make people who hear about your story think that you are fake.", "Then move out.\n\nYou are making this entire situation worse. If you fear for your new baby, you need to remove the child from the house until she gets the help that she needs.\n\nShe also needs someone who isn't you helping her.

You have done the absolute bare minimum to try and make your marriage work.", "Your wife\u2019s friend is not a mental health professional. She was cussed out and told to leave the home and her life. She complied. Contacting you would be reentering your wife\u2019s life. If you\u2019re so worried about your soon to be ex wife, then stay home with her yourself. You prioritized a water park", "She invited her father over to her house, she didn\u2019t take him anywhere, and OP still hasn\u2019t said what FIL did to his son. I don\u2019t think divorcing your post partum wife, who had cut her father off before but is obviously very alone and isolated from her family while you go and impregnate your ex, is the immediate answer.", "I\u2019ve read all of your posts and know all about your racist FIL. Having a racist father doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re racist or share racist values.", "What's your end game here? Is she doing anything to get better? Really? Do you think she can live like this for the rest of her life? When do you think the divorce is gonna happen? How do you plan to live your life moving forward? \n\nAnd i heard a lot of horror stories about hurt babies even when someone else in the house as you can't always keep your eye on her. You aren't doing anything to actively help her and she isn't either. You're in this never-ending limbo of her being a mess and you catering to her without doing anything meaningful.\n\nAnd what's up with your friends insinuating that she's not ill? Do they believe she's manipulating you?", "You aren\u2019t listening at all to what people are saying to you. You can\u2019t handle all this, as you say you are getting divorced. You need to get her seen by a mental health professional. You aren\u2019t equipped to do this, the friend isn\u2019t the AH either. I would have done the same thing, but the fact that there is a child involved makes it a different story. You shouldn\u2019t have left your stbx wife and child alone to go to a water park. Stop wallowing in self pity, get up and call an ambulance. Like the other commentator said, if she\u2019s a danger, they will help her", "Take her to a hospital and tell them you will not be her caregiver when she gets out- then send them her dads number- the hospital will help with a social worker and care plan. If/when she gets out and threatens harming herself you call 911 and stick to this. She won\u2019t get better if she thinks it will make you stay. While she\u2019s in the hospital you talk with a lawyer and get emergency custody.", "I'm sorry. Am I supposed to be angry at the friend for leaving *your* wife and *your* child alone when your wife told her to get out of her house, but it's irrelevant to this situation that you left your wife at home with a newborn multiple times while she begged you to stay, after she had threatened both her own life and the life of your child, with a man who is so racist you're divorcing your wife over giving him access to your child, but apparently not so racist that you won't leave your child home alone with him and your unstable wife, all so you could go fuck your ex?\n\nYou're projecting, sir. The anger you're feeling at your friend for abandoning your wife? That's misdirected anger that should be pointed right back at yourself.", "OP already has all the answers, even though his life is a complete shitstorm. Not sure why anyone is telling him anything since he obviously already knows it all.\n\nLook at his comments and how many \"what if's,\" he writes, including this one I'm responding to. Well, OP...nobody knows the future and living your life based on constant negative what if's sounds like a bad way to live.\n\nAll we know is this is a crazy, toxic, insane situation from the sounds of it. Your wife has mental health issues, you slept with your ex and got her pregnant (\"separated\" or not, you're still married and it's still cheating), your FIL is racist according to you, you fear for your baby's safety...deal with how BAD the NOW is and stop worrying about what if's. Right NOW your baby needs serious help when (as you said in your post/comments) your baby is literally in danger when left alone with your wife.\n\nBe a man and, more importantly, a parent and get your kids out of that situation and professional help for your family. Whatever it takes. Stop letting someone with mental health issues run your life and your kid's life. It's insane reading your comments.", "That\u2019s why I said divorce then pregnancy", "I didn't cheat. I broke up with her well before.", "So, basically...now that I'm reading all the comments after my initial response...I stand by what I said. OP's friend's wife is right about him. He does sound like a disaster and doesn't even realize it. Like you said, no idea why he's still there. Get his kids and get out of there.", "I'm still here because she keeps telling me if I leave something terrible will happen to her. Am I just supposed to ignore that?", "Because I don't want it to work anymore. I don't want to be with her anymore. She makes me miserable.", "I would call isolated from her family when her father is a racist and he ask her not to see him anymore, from all the things you can ask your SO to go LC with their parents, being a racist is in the top of the list. \n\nIt is very stupid to get envolve in so many drama and not the immediate answer, but it is what it is, and he doesn't own a explanation to someone who let a racist get acess to a Black kid", "That's true. Exposing your black stepson to your racist father does though.", "My end game is to make it to the next day. She talks to therapists, but never for more than two sessions. She says when she finds the right one she will improve. She also says if I change my mind about the divorce she will get better, but that's never going to happen. If I can convince her to do uncontested, the divorce will happen immediately. If it has to be contested, it will probably take at least a year. Honestly, lately, I haven't been living my life. Everything has been like a fever dream nightmare.\n\nYes, my friends believe her illness is manufactured, but that's because they don't see it everyday like I do. If she was really faking, she would have to slip up at some point. She never does. Also, she did talk to a psychiatrist once, and she told me the psychiatrist said she has PPD and postpartum anxiety, but she never went again, because she said the psychiatrist called her crazy.", "No, I don't expect you to be angry at her friend.

She needs help, but it is not your duty to give it to her.", "So are you going to live there forever? Change your grandbabies' diapers in that house? Congratulations on your 50th anniversary. Because that is going to happen. That is her goal with that emotional blackmail. She is struggling so bad right now that she is desperate. \n\nListen, she clearly wants you there, to rebuild a relationship with her, but you are done. You are so done that you knocked up your first son\u2019s mother. (Does the wife know that?)\n\nYour presence is going to kill her in the long run. It is going to f uck up her mental state even more than it is now. She needs to help with people who love her, not people who dislike her.\n\nSo yes, get out and ignore her. (Not completely. Still be there to coparent).", "But then you are making decisions that are making the situation even worse.", "Why did you even marry her? This is marriage, not some fly by relationship.

Did he do anything to your son?", "Nah it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s racist it means she doesn\u2019t value your feelings enough to discuss it with you first.", "Idk why you even think she would entertain an uncontested divorce when she still wants to stay together. And tbh if I were her, no way it\u2019d be uncontested after you knocked someone up within weeks after asking for a divorce", "Why would ever leave your child with your unstable wife and a friend who doesn\u2019t believe the illness is real? You risked your baby\u2019s life leaving him in that situation just to go to a water park", "And if she divorces you do you continue living with her because she's ill? \nIs your older son living with you?\n\nAs for your situation NAH, i get that a text would be nice, but most people dont take kindly to being insulted she probably just removed herself from the situation and was like fuck you both to be honest, and if she believes your wife is faking it she didn't feel the need to text.

I guess I was naive.", "I agree, but I think the problem he has with it is that she didn\u2019t talk to him about it first.
