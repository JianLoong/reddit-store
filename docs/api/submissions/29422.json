As a male, I\u2019ve been over to friends\u2019 houses countless times when their significant others wore something similar. It\u2019s totally normal. Your boyfriend is overreacting.  \n  \nYou are both still fairly young, so it might be worth just having an adult conversation about it. If he\u2019s uncomfortable with you wearing that, it\u2019s his problem. If his friends make suggestive comments about you to him, they\u2019re not good friends.   \n  \nWould your boyfriend also be upset if a group of you all went to the beach and you were in a swimsuit?", "ESH. I think people are definitely getting empowerment and appropriateness mixed up. She can wear what she wants, that\u2019s true. However, covering up when guests are over is the appropriate thing to do. Like someone said just a t-shirt or something when you walked out of your room or something. Your boyfriend should not have yelled, I agree.

Let's be honest of your friends came over half naked and he was looking you would be pissed. I understand if you were going to work out, it made sense for you to be wearing that. Was it hard to throw a shirt on top before the friends arrived and you could've just took it right back off before they left. I'm not saying you have to dress that way for them but b/c like I stated earlier of if the situation was reversed I'm sure you would be pissed. Honestly I would've just stayed in the other room until they were done hanging out.", "I think its normal to dress decent when you have guests over.\n\n\nI dont agree with all these \"he is slutshaming, you go girl, be almost naked if thats what u like, if he doesnt like it it's his problem\".\n\nI wouldn't call either of you an AH.\nNow you know where he stands regarding dresscode or whatever you call it.\nAnd you can talk it out.", "Do you have a right to wear those clothes? Sure. Were they appropriate to the situation? No. Just because you can wear an outfit appropriately to the gym doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s appropriate for hanging out at home in front of your bf\u2019s friends. \n\nThink of it this way - it is appropriate to wear a bikini to the pool, right? That doesn\u2019t mean you should wear it at home in front of guests to just hang out with no pool involved.", "ESH. Look, I get the argument: you can wear whatever. But honestly it\u2019s all about intent and understanding that cause and effect is at play. If you dress a certain way, you will get more attention. Was your boyfriend inappropriate for blowing up at you? Absolutely. However, to completely hide behind \u201cit was just sportswear\u201d and to assume you were not receiving that kind of attention is naive at best. Also, you should be more mindful of your boyfriend\u2019s feelings as well. In a way, you\u2019re telling him to build a bridge and get over it, but you\u2019re also ignoring his feelings for the sake of \u201cfemale empowerment\u201d.

In which case, by the current social convention in the community that you and your bf both reside in, what you were wearing is ok for wearing out in public. So the argument as to whether it\u2019s objectively (or as close as you can get to objective in a community of subjective perspectives) appropriate or not is over. It\u2019s *fine*. \n\nNow if you and / or your bf want to run things differently within your own household, that is completely up for debate. In which case it is something that your BF should be bringing up with you, calmly, like a grown-up.

ANYONE know that if you see something you would deem attractive and you rarely ever see it you will peak. anyone saying otherwise is lying.\n\n2) His reaction is way out of line.. he should be able to tell nice an quietly that, that type of clothing is making him uncomfortable if you wear it around his friends. maybe even at all. that is a thing called respect and should be far more common in relationships than it is. and there is a big difference between respectfully listen to that and being controlled. \n\nto be me it seems today that anytime someone in a relationship states what the other person is doing is something they feel uncomfortable with its straight to them being insecure, a control freak and having a toxic personality.\nbeing in a relationship is not just accept ALL of me or get out. that is why so many relationships are failing because people aren lacking the desire to make things work.\n\n\nso my suggestion is to speak with him. find out if this was just a one time thing or if he in general are uncomfortable with the way you dress.\nif that is the case you might have a bigger issue, if it's just that one time I do feel you should respectfully put on a top or t-shirt. nobody is dying of heat because of a t-shirt.", "\u2026.Is this rhetorical or are you looking for pointers on how to dump him?", "NTA", "NTA.

I can tell almost immediately when my husband has something going on.  Not that you are a mind reader.  Just that you could sense he was not comfortable.

When I was into running, I bought the gold standard of sports bras, and they gave me insane cleavage and no padding for the nips. No way I'd go around without a top on.", "Yeah the standards are totally different depending on body type. As a slim-hipped flat chested woman I can wear sports bras and bike shorts to the grocery store and nobody gives me a second look. My curvy friend absolutely cannot without getting stares.", "You're gosh darn right it would.", "Shouldn't this go both ways though. Huge double standards with regard to what people find acceptable daily wear. Revealing wear it what it is, revealing. This is totally your choice and you need to do you. If he comes out in a  g-string there should also be no arguments or issues", "I mean, all my sports bras are the full coverage that people think of, but the fabric is WAY thinner than the cups on my regular bras. I\u2019d feel comfortable wearing my sports bras to run an errand or go to the gym or something, so I guess they\u2019re technically designed to be outerwear, but anyone could see my nipples through them\u2014so I\u2019d never wear them to lunch or to hang out with friends. Even just googling images of sports bras right now, I can tell that 4/5 of the pictured bras don\u2019t have enough padding to cover me. Idk, maybe my nips are just pointier than most, but my experience with sports bras makes some of the comments on this thread equating \u201cappropriate for errands and the gym and chores\u201d with \u201cappropriate to wear in front of company\u201d seem a little disingenuous.", "Yeah a sports bra is more of a crop top.", "Same here\u2026 y\u2019all trynna also say cheerleaders are all asking for it ?? Bc from 14-18years old I wore a sports bra and spandex to practices,commotions, and games\u2026 nobody blew up on us for trynna seduce the audience\u2026there are many other places people wear only a sports bra and shorts.", "In your experience, it\u2019s a farm The only person who is out there is you and animals, but in her experience it\u2019s their home and she knew that others are coming over. If your boyfriend was wearing something very formfitting, like a tank top and tidy Whiteys around the house in your friends were just sitting there gawking at him. How would you feel?", "This man knows something, something! Boobs look great in anything.", "Thanks I was trying to come up with how to even respond to that shit\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd74 all my sports bras are cute and comfy. And if you just have one big boob then there\u2019s an issue somewhere with the bra.", "It isn\u2019t women\u2019s fault if we men can\u2019t control our libidos for an afternoon or so here and there.", "When you can figure out how to ejaculate out of another hole I'll believe you about the only peeing thing. Butts are also mainly for cushioning your spine when you sit. \n\nRegardless, it's not feelings that are the issue, it's behaviors. If you can't sit in a room with your friends girl without staring at her \"whatever turns you on\" then that's a \"you\"  problem, not a \"her\" problem.", "I\u2019m wearing a bikini every day now"]}
