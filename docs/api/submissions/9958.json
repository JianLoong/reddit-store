How \"moderate do you mean? If the allergy is very strong, YTA. \nIf not, YNTA. She has to deal with this forever and you even gave her the option of an alternative.

Even if her allergy is \u201cmoderately\u201d severe, you\u2019re essentially saying you don\u2019t care if she gets sick, because it\u2019s more important that you eat a snack you like. I think yta", "YTA lol so what\u2019re you gonna do when she dies from a nut allergy?", "YTA\n\nYou obviously don't understand allergies.  As my allergist explained it, you start the day with a glass.  The glass can be empty or it can almost full or anywhere in between.  When the glass overflows (from being exposed to too many allergens), then you can wind up with a reaction like anaphylactic shock.   So the overflowing doesn't have to be from that one allergen.  It can be from many allergens, and then one thing makes the glass overflow.   \n\nSo just because you don't have a reaction TODAY doesn't mean you won't have one TOMORROW.  \n\nExample:  A family member wasn't allergic to dogs and cats until recently.  He developed an adult allergic reaction that is severe enough that he misses work when exposed.   If you pet your dog and walk into his house, he will get sick.  The dog doesn't have to actually go inside his house.   He didn't have this problem five years ago.  Now it is a pretty severe allergy.   \n\nSo it isn't about \"fairness.\"  It is about the health of your stepdaughter.  At some point, she might have an accidental exposure where the health becomes at risk.  There might be food cross contamination, where someone touched the food and then touched another container in the fridge.", "YTA because you won\u2019t say what the food is after multiple people have asked, which tells us it\u2019s something that would tip the scales.

You say she might have mild digestive distress. \n\nSo \u2026 celiac?

This kid now has to deal with big life changes with a side of no longer trusting the kitchen as much, and being reminded of what she can\u2019t eat.\n\nIf your wife and her daughter want the house to stop having the food, the fair thing is to listen to them and return to the previous status quo. You can eat it when you\u2019re not at home. It is literally poison to her.", "YTA.  Not for your points about the allergies, as I actually agree with you.  However, you moved into HER home, and disrupted the routines already in place.  Right, or wrong, it is not your place to force this.  Blending families is hard, and you are making it more difficult.

If she has to actually eat something to have a reaction and not just be exposed, then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to have snacks like that. It also is very dependent on if it\u2019s a true food allergy, OAS, or a food intolerance. \n\nI would suggest just keeping certain things away from the foods she can eat and try to keep any cross-contamination to a minimum. She does need to understand that she should be checking things regardless, because some ingredients may change and just because you\u2019ve had it before doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s safe. It\u2019s a good habit to get into especially if she were to develop more allergies or more severely. \n\nI think you did the expected solution to the problem by offering to get her snacks of her own. I might have suggested it sooner before it got to this point, but that\u2019s just hindsight. Unfortunately having allergies means you can\u2019t eat absolutely everything you want to, and not everyone is going to care if you\u2019re allergic or not. You can\u2019t begrudge people for being able to eat something you can\u2019t.
