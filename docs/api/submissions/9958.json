How \"moderate do you mean? If the allergy is very strong, YTA. \nIf not, YNTA. She has to deal with this forever and you even gave her the option of an alternative.

Even if her allergy is \u201cmoderately\u201d severe, you\u2019re essentially saying you don\u2019t care if she gets sick, because it\u2019s more important that you eat a snack you like.

As my allergist explained it, you start the day with a glass.  The glass can be empty or it can almost full or anywhere in between.  When the glass overflows (from being exposed to too many allergens), then you can wind up with a reaction like anaphylactic shock.   So the overflowing doesn't have to be from that one allergen.  It can be from many allergens, and then one thing makes the glass overflow.   \n\nSo just because you don't have a reaction TODAY doesn't mean you won't have one TOMORROW.  \n\nExample:  A family member wasn't allergic to dogs and cats until recently.  He developed an adult allergic reaction that is severe enough that he misses work when exposed.   If you pet your dog and walk into his house, he will get sick.  The dog doesn't have to actually go inside his house.   He didn't have this problem five years ago.  Now it is a pretty severe allergy.   \n\nSo it isn't about \"fairness.\"  It is about the health of your stepdaughter.  At some point, she might have an accidental exposure where the health becomes at risk.  There might be food cross contamination, where someone touched the food and then touched another container in the fridge.", "YTA because you won\u2019t say what the food is after multiple people have asked, which tells us it\u2019s something that would tip the scales.

You say she might have mild digestive distress. \n\nSo \u2026 celiac?

This kid now has to deal with big life changes with a side of no longer trusting the kitchen as much, and being reminded of what she can\u2019t eat.\n\nIf your wife and her daughter want the house to stop having the food, the fair thing is to listen to them and return to the previous status quo. You can eat it when you\u2019re not at home. It is literally poison to her.", "YTA.  Not for your points about the allergies, as I actually agree with you.

If she has to actually eat something to have a reaction and not just be exposed, then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to have snacks like that. It also is very dependent on if it\u2019s a true food allergy, OAS, or a food intolerance. \n\nI would suggest just keeping certain things away from the foods she can eat and try to keep any cross-contamination to a minimum. She does need to understand that she should be checking things regardless, because some ingredients may change and just because you\u2019ve had it before doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s safe. It\u2019s a good habit to get into especially if she were to develop more allergies or more severely. \n\nI think you did the expected solution to the problem by offering to get her snacks of her own. I might have suggested it sooner before it got to this point, but that\u2019s just hindsight. Unfortunately having allergies means you can\u2019t eat absolutely everything you want to, and not everyone is going to care if you\u2019re allergic or not. You can\u2019t begrudge people for being able to eat something you can\u2019t.

It's not serious for me and always in moderation just in case.", "Unless you\u2019re a doctor who has examined this girl, you have absolutely no business saying what she should or shouldn\u2019t do to manage her allergy. Get off your high horse.", "I\u2019m allergic to a common scent. You\u2019re totally right", "You are right you can, but the person I was responding to seemed to be arguing that a dust allergy in a barn and was trying to liken that to a nut allergy, all while in this comment section that specifically states that the step daughter does NOT have that type of issue. \n\nHonestly i can\u2019t find one scientific reference that included nut allergies through inhalation in a gel or foam type form (Mayo, NSW Health Dept, NHS UK,  AAFA, etc.) that would rationally preclude someone from standing in a barn with a pb frosting. Nut flour, yes or crushed nuts under foot, yes or peanut oil spray, yes. But nothing even remotely close to what that person was responding to. \n\nSo help me out here on how their comment was pertinent or relevant to anything in this comment section?", "Nobody in their right mind should disagree to this. But it's a different concept than the one OP is describing, like you said.", "Lol, yes.  We rub the food on hid arm, if no reaction, on his face, if no reaction on his lips, I'd no reaction he eats some.", "My favorite pizza has not a hint of tomato--mascarpone and Roman cheeses, rock shrimp, and lemon slices on a killer crust", "Dear lord. Tomatoes? I certainly wouldn't be giving up on pizza, pasta and basically everything with tomato paste. It sucks for the daughter, but that doesn't mean it has to suck for everyone else.", "For me, it was due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. I was 21 years old... yay.", "Developed a soy allergy in my mid-20s! Can definitely happen", "I am 35 and I think I have a sea food allergy. And shellfish.", "They can go way, too.  I am no longer allergic to shellfish, when I was allergic enough as a kid to have an epi pen.  I don't like the taste, so it really doesn't matter either way to me, only I don't always have to ask if the egg rolls have shrimp when getting Chinese food.", "I used to eat an apple every single day. Became allergic a few years ago. I don\u2019t have a severe allergy, but enough that I should probably never eat one again.", "You worded that nicer than I was going to", "Better than the allergy test for my poor kiddo yrs ago. Her back was turned into a grided out pincushion.", "It could be worse, my kids are allergic to the entire nightshade family: tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants and peppers.\n\nYou learn to deal. They have been to plenty of parties and they know not to eat the pizza.  Or potato chips.", "My bff's mom developed an oyster allergy after giving birth! She ate chicken in oyster sauce a few days before giving birth, and then a week after giving birth ordered it again and BOOM covered head to toe in hives.", "Again, you are making strawman arguments to knockdown, so I question your veracity, because if you had a reasoned argument you wouldn\u2019t need to lie about what is being said. \n\nCould you quote the exact portion of the comment where anyone but you brought up dust?  Also please quote the exact comment that included transference to other food that you were responding to?  Let\u2019s couple this with the burning question of why, when this whole thing is about a nut allergy, you didn\u2019t mention that until later in your argument when it was pointed out your dust allergy comment wasn\u2019t relevant. \n\nThis seems like someone just making thinks up to argue.", "Your username is amazing lol I see you Vicky!", "He's does that, too.  For whatever reason, rice doesn't come back positive for that testing.", "I had one as a kid. Between you and others who have said the same thing, I apparently am very lucky. They only stuck my arm like a pin cushion. But that was in 1984 or \u201885!  \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "That's rough. At least there are some replacement options available today, but I'd be seriously unhappy to develop such an allergy today. Authentic italian puzza is so good!", "If insults could end careers, you'd have just gotten that doctors entire family fired. I wish reddit still had free awards.", "I never said anything about dust. I mentioned an airborne allergic reaction. The person making the original statement just said that their friend was \"dramatic\" about their food allergy. Which is a dismissive attitude. I used my own experience as an example of why this kind of thinking is harmful.\n\nIf you don't think I'm telling the truth, that's fine. You're just a random stranger on the internet. I know my truth and that's all that matters.", "Mine came back as only being allergic to dust and mold. However I am allergic to cats, dogs and rabbits!", "Hmm. Weird. No food allergies for mine but allergic to dogs, dust mites and certain trees", "I don't come back for pineapple with the prick test, but I have burning, itching rash when I eat it so... probably allergic. But it's so good!", "You specifically talked about a dust allergy in a barn (you wouldn\u2019t let you son in an environment like that and specifically mentioned an epipen, so sever allergy). when someone stated being afraid of PB frosting in a barn environment was dramatic, directly trying to contradict their assertion. Why bring up a dust allergy in a thread about nut allergies?  Similarly, why bring up food transference in a conversation of airborne/inhalation risk?  \n\nNut allergies aren\u2019t anything to play with, but the thought of a PB frosting inhalation reaction in a barn is just ridiculous, unless this is a peanut farm and then the frosting still doesn\u2019t come into play."]}
