Even now she treats me like I am disgusting and dirty sometimes, telling me to wash my hands and stuff and is visibly repulsed if I get too close.\n\nThey came with their shared laptop that my ex got for them and my ex had told me that they should only be allowed to play for 2 or 3 hours a day depending on how much free time they have and that I can deduct hours for bad behavior. The first day, my son started first and there are some games he likes to play. My daughter was watching him play so I counted that towards her allowance as she was watching the screen so her total eye fatigue would be the same.\n\nShe did not realize this I think, and after he finished she asked to go next and I told her she couldn't.  She got hysterical and wailed and stomped while screaming that I am unfair. When she calmed down she asked if she could use the computer to learn python instead of play and I said no as she had used up her screen time. (My ex works in software and has been teaching her python, which is a basic programming language recently but my son is not interested in that).  She again got angry and said to ask mommy, but I have custody of them as well and I am allowed to set rules too and I did not want to bug my ex over this. I took away half of her time for the next day as well for her behavior.\n\nThe other days she did not watch my son play and used her time for python. I had to deduct time on two other occasions for her because she wouldn't eat something I handed her claiming my hands were dirty and when kissed her goodnight she said ew and that my beard was disgusting. Overall she was acting quite pouty but I didn't want her time to go to zero so I let it slide.\n\nMy ex came to pick them when she came back, but when she got home, my daughter blurted stuff to her and I don't know exactly what she told her or whether she lied about some things but my ex got angry and called me saying I am an AH.", "created_utc": 1679611988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1200i47/aita_for_counting_the_time_my_daughter_spent/", "score": 647, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then I would\u2019ve explained to her that in the future, when her brother is using his screen time she should do something else. This way, when she\u2019s using hers, she won\u2019t incur double the eye strain. Then I\u2019d tell her she could do it just this once (because one extra helping of screen time one time isn\u2019t going to give her cataracts tomorrow), and make sure they both understood that they should engage in other activities unless they wanted to use their screen time simultaneously doing something together.

She\u2019s literally afraid to let you touch her unless you\u2019ve washed your hands recently enough.

That\u2019s just so cruel.\n\nI\u2019m gonna speculate here. You *know* exactly why your daughter finds you to be so disgusting. I\u2019ll bet your marriage ended because you had an extramarital affair and your daughter came to know more about this than her young mind can handle. She finds you unclean because she knows you acted \u201cuncleanly.\u201d I\u2019m a child of divorce who had behavioral issues growing up, and when you labeled as a troubled child of a single parent, you find yourself in mandated group therapy from the school district with other disaffected children of divorce in your age group. I\u2019ve seen all kinds of behaviors associated with trauma from divorce, and I\u2019ve never heard of somebody being disgusted by the uncleanliness of a parent\u2019s touch, requiring them to wash their hands frequently. It\u2019s hard for me to believe that such an extreme and specific behavior isn\u2019t rooted in a reaction to your stimulus. /speculation. But even if I\u2019m wrong, and this behavior is an irrational manifestation of her inability to process your divorce, it is nothing but counterproductive for you to trample these boundaries and punish her for being triggered. Whether or not you did anything to earn her disgust is irrelevant. She\u2019s your daughter. She\u2019s suffering. Your **daughter** is **suffering.** She *needs* and **deserves** your empathy and compassion, and instead you\u2019re reacting to her with dismissiveness under the guise of tough \u201clove.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re failing her as a father at her most vulnerable. I hope your ex has her in therapy; I hope you get yourself into therapy.

You should have told her that her reaction was wrong, but you would give her a pass since it was a new rule she only learned about after the fact.\n\nHer rejection of you after you kissed her was kind of harsh, but that's also a direct result of your failure to properly communicate with her. She's 12, your relationship is strained right now, you're aware she finds your hygiene practices lacking whether that's fair or not, and she likely feels wrongly punished by you. You should have asked her if she wanted a goodnight kiss before taking it upon yourself to give her one. Even if your punishment was about her unkind words rather than her not wanting a kiss, her takeaway was more than likely, 'Dad punished me because I don't want him to kiss me.'

Her mother has a high level of cleanliness so it possible that rubbed off on your daughter before the divorce.

Usually I do not have them on weekends and I have less days than my ex. My ex had to travel from last weekend to early this week and for a change I had them.\n\nMy daughter has never really liked me as she was older when we got divorced and took my ex's side, but she is a kid so I don't hold it against her. Even now she treats me like I am disgusting and dirty sometimes, telling me to wash my hands and stuff and is visibly repulsed if I get too close.\n\nThey came with their shared laptop that my ex got for them and my ex had told me that they should only be allowed to play for 2 or 3 hours a day depending on how much free time they have and that I can deduct hours for bad behavior. The first day, my son started first and there are some games he likes to play. My daughter was watching him play so I counted that towards her allowance as she was watching the screen so her total eye fatigue would be the same.\n\nShe did not realize this I think, and after he finished she asked to go next and I told her she couldn't.  She got hysterical and wailed and stomped while screaming that I am unfair. When she calmed down she asked if she could use the computer to learn python instead of play and I said no as she had used up her screen time. (My ex works in software and has been teaching her python, which is a basic programming language recently but my son is not interested in that).  She again got angry and said to ask mommy, but I have custody of them as well and I am allowed to set rules too and I did not want to bug my ex over this. I took away half of her time for the next day as well for her behavior.\n\nThe other days she did not watch my son play and used her time for python. I had to deduct time on two other occasions for her because she wouldn't eat something I handed her claiming my hands were dirty and when kissed her goodnight she said ew and that my beard was disgusting. Overall she was acting quite pouty but I didn't want her time to go to zero so I let it slide.\n\nMy ex came to pick them when she came back, but when she got home, my daughter blurted stuff to her and I don't know exactly what she told her or whether she lied about some things but my ex got angry and called me saying I am an AH.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As someone who is currently parenting 14, 12, and 7 year olds, I can guarantee you that being in a battle with your kids will rarely end well for you.

Talk together about different solutions and encourage her to come up with some creative things. And instead of going straight to a punitive reaction when she was watching her brother on the computer, you could have easily said \u201chey kiddo, so part of my concern with too much screen time is fatigue on your eyes! So this time I\u2019m not going to deduct any of your time, but next time I want you to know that we will have to deduct from your time to keep your eyes safe.

You are teaching your daughter that even if she doesn\u2019t want to be touched she needs to be a good girl and allow it.

This is not the kind of shit they get bratty about. \nBut it looks like you comment largely on AITA posts about kids and always call them assholes\u2026. so I\u2019m going to assume you just don\u2019t like kids.", "None of the behavior described makes her sound pouty. Refusing to eat food because you're uncomfortable with the hygiene of the person making it is completely reasonable. As is not wanting physical contact.", "Oh, I would have told all of their disgusting asses to get back in and wash their hands!", "I know right,  my brother in law never washed his hands and he lived with Mommy until he found a new wife/mommy age 55.    He never washed his hands and mom didn't say boo about it.   I trained my husband to wash his hands but sheesh", "I refuse to use the washroom at work. So fucking gross", "You said in one of your comments and I quote:\n>I already answered this, I shower almost daily\n\nSo which is is? You shower once a day or almost once a day", "Last year for SOME rooms? I suspect that your daughter may be right, and you\u2019re a bit grimy. Specifically telling you to wash your hands also leads me to believe you must have some sort of physical job that leaves your hands looking gross and you probably need to tend to them more.", "Jesus.  When it looks dirty it's too late.  Also your daughter has body autonomy.  Don't kiss her when she doesn't want it.  It's good to teach kids to say no.", "Last year? Eww. You do seem gross \n\nWhatever your differing views on hygiene, it's entirely unreasonable to punish your daughter for them. If she's uncomfortable getting a kiss from you don't kiss her. And don't punish her for it wtf. And it's not remotely unreasonable to not want to take food from someone without knowing if they washed their hands - why are you handing her food anyway? You're punishing her for expressing discomfort, which is a dick move anyway. And the counting of computer time because she was just watching is absurd and I think you know that, you just want to punish your daughter because you're hurt she thinks you're gross.", "**SOME** rooms?\n\n\nSir you\u2019re a fucking slob", "So you\u2019re unhygienic to the point of your 12yo listening to the tap? Sir. She is not a neat freak. You\u2019ve shown to be filthy and that you cannot be trusted. And you\u2019ve just made it worse by telling her about a lame rule after she broke it. Why should she trust you to wash your hands properly if she can\u2019t even trust you to be fair in making rules and punishments?\n\nNot to mention the fact that she was 9 in 2020.\n\nEdit: my bad. Being hygienic shouldn\u2019t even be a worry.  Why should you be trusted if you can\u2019t even be trusted to wash your hands?", "You do wash. Except for when you forget. I wouldn\u2019t want to eat anything you touched either, your daughter deserves better.", "The fact that your kid is listening in to make sure washing your hands tells us everything we need to know\u2026", "No you\u2019ve said many times that you do wash \u201cmost of the time\u201d.\n\n\nIf someone told me \u201chey sometimes our restaurant serves you food with piss and crap particles but most of the time it\u2019s all good!\u201d You\u2019d bet your ass nobody is eating there again.", "I bet you ruffle your fingers in the water and the soap bar is dry.", "Not wanting someone to touch your food that has touched their penis is not a clean freak. Disgusting", "So you punish her by claiming \u201ceye fatigue\u201d so she can\u2019t play on the computer. Got it.  YTA!", "It is genuinely sickening that you touch your penis and then handle your 12 year old daughter's food with your unwashed hands and punish her if she won't eat it. Why would you want anything your penis has touched to go anywhere near your child's mouth?", "you are gross. you ARE ok with giving food to your daughter after your filthy hands touched your penis. WASH YOUR HANDS", "Your daughter is 12, of course she finds boys dirty \ud83e\udd23", "Your username here is \u201cassholedaugh\u201d. About your 12 year old. You are kind of a creepy guy aren\u2019t you?", "How in the hell do you \u201cforget\u201d to wash your hands WHEN THE SINK IS RIGHT THERE? I have never been in a bathroom where you didn\u2019t have to see the sink before you left. Ever. Anywhere. Sounds a lot more like you just don\u2019t want to wash your hands.", "I do use soap.", "Look, there\u2019s a lot wrong with this guy, but splitting the hair between daily showers and occasionally skipping a day is kinda far from the mark, no?", "My house is clean, even my ex has commented that she was surprised at how much cleaner I keep the home now that we split.", "Honestly, it\u2019s less about touching his penis, and more about him touching the flusher - which has been touched by poopy and peepy hands. I think that\u2019s the biggest thing people don\u2019t think about when going to the bathroom. Most men don\u2019t wipe when they pee, but they hopefully touch the flusher, which has been touched by people who do wipe, including themselves after a dump.\n\nETA: I wonder how OP\u2019s teeth brushing habits are. I\u2019m pretty grossed out by how many people I\u2019ve met that don\u2019t brush twice a day, and sometimes don\u2019t even brush daily.", "I have literally never said I do this, wtf. It is just something some commenters have been making up.\n\nI admit I had a problem when my ex and I were together but I have changed my ways and it was not an issue on this visit of my kids.", "12 year old boys also often are dirty and forget to wash their hands after the bathroom - op has a lot in common with them maturity wise", "Now*", "I mean yeah. But he also did say two completely different things, and I'm just genuinely curious about which it is. I wasn't trying to be like \"ha gotcha I knew you were disgusting\" because of the difference. He's already pretty gross in my book, I was just curious", "I agree with you and feel like the comments have devolved into \"doesn't wash his hands enough, nasty mofo\" and not the resentment he seems to have towards his daughter shown through the actions he wrote here and telling him that he needs to address that because he is most assuredly the AH. \n\nAt this point the comments are beating a dead horse and I legit feel bad for him having to read through them for some bit of helpful advice.", "If you haven't \"deep cleaned\" the house in a YEAR, it isn't clean. And even when you claim you did that, it was only \"some rooms.\" Disgusting.\n\nAnd I question your definition of \"deep clean.\" When was the last time you wiped the baseboards? The heating vents? When was the last time your kitchen floor was mopped or scrubbed on your hands and knees? How often do you completely clean your toilets (toilet bowl cleaner, scrub with toilet brush, disinfecting spray on outside and wiped from floor to top of reservoir)? \n\nYTA in a major way. Also, don't handle people's food directly unless you've just washed your hands with SOAP and water for at least 20 consecutive seconds AND haven't touched anything dirty in between (including your face, clothes, and body).", "Cleaner does not mean the home is clean. Just cleaner than the slob you were before. And it\u2019s not clean if you don\u2019t use soap.", "Dude you can change your ways all you want, but the damage has been done. You need to work on respecting her boundaries and then maybe she'll open up to you. If you really want to help start going the extra step with performative hygiene. Wash your hands often in front of her, make sure you shower daily, and cleanup constantly. She will see the change and maybe come around. Then again maybe she won't. What is guaranteed is that if you continue you act the way you are now she will keep you at arms length for the rest of her life.", "Your hygiene was bad enough at one point that it scarred your daughter. Let that sink in. And you admitted you sometimes \"forget\" to wash your hands after you pee. Adults don't forget that. You just choose not to and it is disgusting.", ">I shower almost daily and I do wash my hands when I take a dump.

Now you remember to wash your hands \"most of the time\" and get angry if your daughter checks before she eats food you touched. \n\nAnd with the computer, she followed your rules perfectly and without complaint once she knew what they were. Face it, you just don't like your daughter and she knows it.", "you said you forget to clean your hands when you piss so yes you did literally say it", ">Sometimes I forget with I go for a piss that is true but I make an effort to remember these days.", "I mean, I guess my point is that they\u2019re not completely different things. \u201cI shower daily\u201d implies a daily routine which includes a shower. \u201cI shower almost daily\u201d is a qualified acknowledgment that you occasionally exempt a day from the daily routine. At a certain point you round up."]}
