When I got the job I asked her if she wanted to move to the new city with me and she agreed.  She quit her job to come with me and I told her I can support us both while she looks for a new job.  She said that she wanted to also focus on finishing a book she's been working on while looking for a job at the same time.  We moved here about 6 months ago.\n\nI have a 10-year-old dog that I have had since college.  He's a smaller dog, only about 25 pounds.  Since my GF is at home during the day, she takes him for walks.  She met a single mom, Beth, on one of her walks and they quickly became friends.  I was elated that my GF was able to find someone to make the new city more comfortable for her.  \n\nLast Saturday, my GF took my dog over to Beth's house while I was working on a home improvement project.  She was there for 3-4 hours.  Early Sunday morning, my dog began acted weird.  I asked my GF is anything happened at Beth's house the day before, like if he had eaten anything he shouldn't have.  \n\nMy GF called Beth and Beth confirmed that she didn't see my dog eat anything.  I asked my GF to ask Beth if she had given her kids grapes as a snack while my dog was there.  I saw my GF's face turn white on the phone.  After she hung up, she said that Beth had given her kids grapes as snacks and her 4-year-old told her that they were playing a game with the dog and giving him grapes.  They have no idea how many my dog ate.\n\nI immediately took my dog to the emergency vet.  The started treatment immediately but wanted to keep him for observation.  He ended up needing to stay for over 48 hours, but he'll live.  There is still a very high possibility that he will have life-long complications because no one knows how many grapes he had.  The total bill is almost $5K.  \n\nI told my GF that I want her and/or Beth to either cover the cost or at least help with it.  She said that Beth is a single mom and she's not going to ask her to help pay for such a huge bill.  She also said that she doesn't have that kind of money because she hasn't found a job yet.  I told her that it's time she gets a job ASAP then. \n\nShe started making excuses about how the kids didn't know what they were doing so it really is just an accident.  I told her that if her and Beth had actually been watching my dog and the kids then this wouldn't have happened, and since they were the 2 adults in the situation, it was on them to properly supervise the kids and dog.  She said it's unreasonable of me to expect Beth to pay so much for an accident.\n\nI told her that if my dog had injured one of Beth's kids, then obviously I would be expected to help pay for any costs related to that, so I don't see how this is any different.  She is refusing to even ask Beth to pay and is begging me not to confront Beth about it on my own because she doesn't want to lose her only friend here.", "created_utc": 1671029232, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlsuu6/aita_for_expecting_my_gf_andor_her_friend_to_pay/", "score": 321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think the responsibility should be on Beth. However, your girlfriend is a bit of a different story. I don't think that there should have to be an additional financial burden on you when the problem didn't arise from you. You've already taken on the financial burdens for an extended period of time at this point and I don't think asking your girlfriend to chip into the vet expenses is out of line. That is with the caveat that you are not doing it in a mean way. I do believe that she dropped the ball on this one a little bit and should have made sure that the dog was safe, but with that being said accidents happen. She needs to help make up for that accident though.", "NTA it's just like you said if your dog had injured one of her kids, even if on accident, she would be demanding compensation.

You don't say how long you have been with this woman, but her initial mishandling of your dog and her reaction to the event afterwards is pretty bad. Money wouldn't be my only concern.\n\nThis is really irresponsible behaviour on both their parts. Unsupervised  dogs with small kids is a recipe for disaster, for either of them.

Beth should not be held responsible for your girlfriend's negligence.", "NTA. \n\nYour girlfriend made the choice to take the dog to Beth's house, so she is responsible for actually taking care of the dog. \n\nI wouldn't confront Beth either, by the way, because this is fully on your girlfriend.

She should know what dogs can and can't eat, and shouldn't have left the kids unsupervised with the dogs. \n\n6 months is plenty of time to find a job, particularly in this economy (at least in most places) so please realize your girlfriend is happy to just sit around all day letting you support her. I live in a major city, and I could walk in to literally any restaurant, coffee shop, or bar - retail too- and get a job that day. Trust me, I wouldn't have said that 3 years ago and have struggled to find work myself before, so I am not being uppity or out of touch about this. And of course, if the country you are in is different, ignore me. \n\nTell your girlfriend no more dog at Beth's house, and that she needs to get a job in the next month and she needs to pay you back, at least for half. In the meantime, she doesn't get money for anything that isn't a necessity, and if you were giving her any \"fun money\" that is going to go to the vet bills until she gets a job. To be clear, she needs to eat, she needs a cell phone, etc. so I'm not saying financial abuse. But she doesn't need to go out for coffee, get her hair or nails done, go out for drinks, etc. because you are out $5k and it needs to start coming from somewhere. \n\nStuff like this happens in life, but it is how we handle it that matters. BTW we used to try and feed my dogs grapes because we didn't know they were bad (pre solid internet, in the AOL dial up days) so I can sympathize. If I were your girlfriend, I would just tell you- \"please don't confront Beth, I didn't know grapes were bad for dogs and this is fully on me.  I am working on getting a job and will of course cover this bill.

You are also responsible for letting your dog go to someone else's home where you weren't able to monitor it. Sure, you expected your GF to monitor him, but all dog people know that non-dog people don't know any of the important information of raising a dog or keeping it alive. \n\nI think all of you should pay to cover the costs, but if your girlfriend wants to cover Beth's portion, let her. At the same time, don't let your GF take your dog again without being educated on foods that aren't allowed to be fed to dogs. Print out a list or something.", "NTA - but this is why people need pet insurance", "NTA. It's her responsibility to care for the pup and ensure that they are in a safe environment. Children should be supervised when around any animal, for the animal's safety more-so than theirs. It sound like your girlfriend has become too preoccupied with making friends around town, rather than acting like an adult. An adult does not take 6 months to find a job and laze about(idc about the little book she is writing.) This could have killed your pup! She and the other woman need to take responsibility and cover the fine. If she doesn't want to do so, it might be in your best interest to dump the dead weight and find a more mature companion who understands actions have consequences, as does shirking responsibilities. Maybe she can go live with her new friend she wants to protect? I wouldn't trust her with my dog alone ever again tbh, she lost that trust.", "Nta , they were supposed to supervise both the dog and the kids.", "TIL that grapes are toxic for dogs.

Though I\u2019d argue it\u2019s your girlfriends responsibility to pay you back and not Beth. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was an accident or not, since when does an accident make you free of any responsibility?\n\nAlso, the excuse that the girlfriend didn\u2019t know is BS. You don\u2019t just let a dog eat anything without at least doing a quick search to see whether or not it\u2019s safe? It\u2019s called common sense, which really isn\u2019t all that common.", "NTA I AM LIVID on your behalf! Omg I am so sorry, I hope your dog makes a full recovery. This must be so horrible. Absolutely they or your gf should cover the cost. If she does not make an effort then it\u2019s time to save some money by not continuing to financially support her.", "This is a tough one. I'm going to go NTA but only just. \n\nFirstly to, the people here that are calling you TA because they don't know what is and isn't safe for dogs to eat: dogs aren't people; people are generalists in a dietary sense and unlike most animals, can eat damn near anything, while the same cannot be said of dogs. If you give a dog \"human\" food, make sure it's safe for them to eat - that's just the responsible thing to do. That tip applies to pretty much any animal one might keep as a pet.\n\nSecondly, it sounds like your GF was doing you a favor in getting the dog out of your hair while you were doing house renovations. She was under no obligation to take your doggone over there, but she did. She is, however, in the wrong for not adequately supervising your four-legged friend. She knew dogs shouldn't eat grapes, though she might not have known the kids were feeding them to the dog. That said, she's unemployed. I agree that your GF at the very least needs to help out with some of the vet bills.\n\nThe friend, though? She's a struggling single parent with no knowledge of what dogs can and can't eat, same with her kids. I feel asking for her to compensate you is unlikely to come to fruition, and honestly a wasted effort. Don't let your dog go over there again. She was under no obligation to watch your dog, but is responsible for her kids. When the kids mentioned the game they were playing, she should have checked that grapes were safe to eat, but she didn't. Ideally, due to that, she ought to help pay as well, but again it might not be worth it to pursue that. \n\nPersonally, I'd bring it up to GF that once she has a job, you expect some recompense for the vet bills, but a fair amount, not the whole thing. Find a number that works for you both, and maybe a repayment plan, as well. And then take the money she pays you back and put it in a separate account for future vet bills, should they arise.", "INFO\n\nBecause I'm confused not necessarily because it'll affect my judgement, what made you think to ask if Beth had supplied her kids with grapes? That question seemed to come out of nowhere.", "NTA\n\nYeah, the kids didn't know what they were doing. That's why you're not blaming the kids or asking them for money. You're blaming the adults who could have prevented the situation. \n\nIf $5k is unobtainable for Beth, she and your GF can split the cost and pay you back over time. Low repayments, interest free. I bet that's a far more generous offer than Beth would give you if her child were injured.", "This is a really hard one honestly. A lot of people don\u2019t know that grapes are toxic for dogs, so I genuinely believe this was an accident. I\u2019m going with NAH. \n\nYou are the one who took your GF to a new city and told her she didn\u2019t need an income. You\u2019re the reason she\u2019s trying to make friends. And it\u2019s you who rushed the dog to the vet because he\u2019s ultimately your responsibility. You would have been an AH for not taking him, but it was your choice to take an uninsured pet to the emergency vet. His bills and his care fall to you. It\u2019s not fair to ask anyone else to be responsible for the cost of your pet.\n\nI do think you should tell Beth because it\u2019s doubtful she understands the harm that was done. But she doesn\u2019t owe you anything.", "The real question is would you rather pay $5000 or lose your GF.  Take a step back and think about the outcome of this.", "NAH. Until I started a relationship with a dog owner, I had no idea how many things could literally kill a dog that humans could eat with no ill effects. I understand why you're angry - your dog almost died, it cost you a bomb to treat it and it might have life-long complications but no one here did anything malicious. A dog is in some ways like a toddler. You wouldn't leave your toddler with people you weren't completely happy knew what they were doing. This is no different. An even better analogy is to leave a toddler with food allergies with people who are not aware of what they are nor how dangerous they could be. You might not want to hear this but stuff like this happens.", "NAH. you are supporting your GF right now as she looks for jobs so it\u2019s unrealistic to expect her to pay for the vet bills.

NAH", "Nta", "NTA, it may have just been an accident but they're still the ones responsible for it happening. There are ways to compromise on it a little though, if you're willing, considering the circumstances.\n\nFirst of all, talk to the vet's office and see if there's any possibility of a payment plan, if you haven't done so already. Secondly, let your girlfriend know that if she isn't going to ask Beth about helping with the bill, then you expect her to cover at least 50% of it herself (or otherwise the minimum % you're willing to accept), and if she has to take a really shit job to do that, then that you'd be okay with her quitting that one as soon as the bill is payed for, and go back to the original plan you two had. You may have been willing to let her move at her own pace on getting a job before, but this is an emergency situation and a cost you hadn't accounted for when that plan was made.\n\nIf she changes her tune about asking Beth, maybe the three of you could split the amount evenly. You could have Beth make a payment plan with YOU, so that you get the money without it risking her ability to care for herself and her children.\n\nMake sure that you get any agreement that you come to with either of them in writing, in case for some reason you end up needing to take either to small claims court in the future. Even if you don't feel like it's necessary, even if you feel weird doing so, even if they try to talk you out of it, GET IT IN WRITING!! Also, save any and all text conversations you might have with your girlfriend about the situation, again just in case. Better to be safe than sorry.\n\nEither of those plans would take some charitably on your part, I know; Rightfully, the two of them should be fully responsible for the entire bill.

Insured or not, the kids hurt the dog.\n\n It was an honest mistake, yes, but you're still responsable for the mistake you make and the consequences you provoke. Having a car insurance doesn't absolve you from driving safely.\n\nGF was in charge of the dog and the mother was supposed to be in charge of her kids, they both failed.", "Say Beth had a teenage child crash and damage OPs car. Regardless of insurance, Beth is responsible for the damage her dependent caused. \nYou think OP should be responsible for someone else\u2019s damage? Or if someone attacked your child they shouldn\u2019t be financially responsible because you\u2019re solely responsible for your dependent? \n\nWhat does lack of insurance have to with anything? Note, pet insurance doesn\u2019t work like human insurance and rarely covers anything.", "Tbf it\u2019s a family dog adopted when I was 13, but also I don\u2019t give my dog much human food that is questionable so no, I haven\u2019t lol", "\u2026.right and neither of the people he\u2019s asking for money are pet owners. Arguably the GF could\u2019ve done more research if she\u2019s going to be responsible for the dog during the day, which is why I said it makes to work out something with her to pay eventually. But the friend who she was visiting has 0 responsibility to look it up or know that information and shouldn\u2019t have to give OP a dime.", "she said she wants to write a book first.  this is her first excuse...\n\nyes, she had a job before OP said he would cover her expenses if she moved with him.  \n\nI am saying i doubt very much that she will any time soon.  Also, her not taking responsibility for a problem that happened under her watch tells me she is not interested in paying her way.", "It's already been 6 months of her \"looking for a job\". There is no evidence she is interested in getting a job.", "I only learnt it a few years ago, and I\u2019ve lived with dogs my whole life", "Never assume a dog can eat anything. Pay attention to a bunch of kids giving him snacks.", "You ever looked up how many grapes it takes to kill a dog?\n\nOne.", "Yours is a good comparison. I\u2019ll need to think on that. \n\nMy first response was going to be small claims court, but I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s actually a case for that.", "Except the GF knows grapes are toxic to dogs so not a good comparison", "Fine different hypothetical let\u2019s say you hired a dog sitter and they hurt they\u2019re dog or if a neighbour accidentally hit your dog with a car \nWould you pay or would you get the person hurt your dog pay", "Actually I think a better comparison would be if his girlfriend took his car to their house and the friend let her kids play outside. They threw a ball that broke one of his car's windows. They might not have intended to break the window but they still did. Parents are responsible for paying for the actions of their kids. Nta OP.", "asking someone to pay for the bills they caused is asking for accountability, not punishing them. Fun fact, even if you hit another car by accident, you still have to pay for damages. Paying for the consequences of your actions is a foundational part of society.", "It's absolutely valid.  If one of Beth's kids yanked my dog's tail or ear and my dog reacted defensively and hurt them, you know damn well that Beth would be expecting me to compensate her for it.", "OP has said his gf has known for years grapes are toxic to dogs", "I've been a dog owner for 38 years and didn't know grapes were dangerous to dogs.", "Her financial circumstances should have no bearing on whether or not she should be held responsible for the consequences of the accident she cause due to her negligence.", "OP didn\u2019t have to tell his gf the common knowledge grapes are toxic to dogs bc she already knew", "Doesn't matter if the price is a joke, any more than it matters that hospital bills for people in the US are a joke. You're on the hook for it whether the charges are reasonably calculated or not, and 5k is easily in the ballpark of what one can expect a visit to an emergency vet to cost, especially in a city.", "She knew.  That's why she reacted the way she did when Beth told her about her kids giving my dogs grapes.", "Direct action can also be the gf creating the situation by bringing someone else's dog to a house with kids and not watching the dog and not telling the kids not to feed it. You don't give food to someone else's dog without asking the owner if its okay.", "So should the children pay for the vet cost because they were the ones who actually gave the dog the grapes?", "Legally it is the proximate cause. Which is what matters.", "Beth wasn't the one who fed the dog though.", "I never said that. You said it wasn't a mistake, I'm just explaining why it is. I never said gf or friend aren't in the wrong, they are. I'm just saying that gf and friend didn't intentionally cause this to happen.", "Honestly, I read it as gf and Beth didn't know until the phone call, when Beth asked her four year old and found out then. If I misinterpreted that, then I'll gladly correct myself, but I thought it was that neither knew until after it happened.", "My pet insurance covers cases exactly like this. It doesn\u2019t cover much for routine care but it saves you from unexpected emergencies.", "Saying you don\u2019t know what foods are highly dangerous to dogs isn\u2019t the argument you think it is. Especially since OP said in multiple comments his partner is aware that grapes are poisonous to dogs.\n\nI recommend doing that Google search now because the list goes beyond chocolate, artificial sweeteners, and grapes/raisins and you should be aware of it.", "When you take responsibility of a dog \u2014 even to go visit a friend, you become the temporary owner and are responsible for the dog. This is ENTIRELY the girlfriend\u2019s fault and she\u2019s lucky the dog didn\u2019t die due to her incompetence.", "Did she actually know? OP just keeps saying she\u2019s had dogs before. Well so have half the people in this thread wha are saying TIL\u2026 so it\u2019s possible she didn\u2019t know before because otherwise she probably would have paid attention that the kids were eating grapes.", "If you hire someone there is a contract in place and an implied warranty that they will take care of the animal. Dog sitter is liable. \n\nIf the neighbour accidentally hurts your dog, there is no contractual relationship, only a tortious relationship. Therefore, it will depend on whether the neighbour was negligent or not. For example, if the dog was loose on the road and the neighbour could not have avoided them, it is unlikely the neighbour would be found negligent. If the neighbour was looking at their phone, mounted the footpath and hit your dog whilst you were taking it for a walk, the neighbour would be liable. It's not always so clear cut, and sometimes the courts will apportion liability between both parties when their has been contributory negligence from both sides.", "Since that is a completely hypothetical situation, we\u2019ll never know what Beth \u201cwould\u201d do. All we know is what\u2019s happening here, and that is that you have a dog and the dog is sick and the vet bills are on you.", "No \u2014 he said she had dogs before.", "Said that a couple hours after I responded.  Doesn\u2019t change the fact that he had her uproot her life, move across the country knowing that he would work and pay the bills while she wrote a book.  Choosing to be responsible for the bills to persuade her to move with him doesn\u2019t change.  Volunteering to be responsible doesn\u2019t change because an accident happened.  Nothing made him offer that.  They could have split and she stay behind.  \n\nInstead, he chose to be responsible for the bills   She kept up her end and moved with him.   There\u2019s a \u201cno backsies\u201d provision built in.", "Oh, you are being entirely too sensible here.", "He says she had dogs before. He doesn\u2019t say she actually knew. This entire thread is full of people including me who have had dogs and learned today that grapes are toxic to them. He may have assumed she knew but that was a dangerous assumption.", "By that logic OP directly caused this by letting his girlfriend care for the dog.", "That's the funny thing about everyone downvoting me.  They assume I'm on the side of the gf or friend's mom.  I'm just saying directly caused is wrong.\n\nMy earnest answer? Taking legal responsibility out of the equation, I think kids' mom should pay something.  Her kids did the dumb thing.  People take dogs everywhere and GF couldn't have reasonably been any more aware than the average person that someone might do something incredibly dumb to harm the dog.  \n\nNotice OP said \"Since my GF is at home during the day, she takes him for walks.\"  He's directly giving her responsibility and benefiting financially from it by not having to pay a walker.  If it were me, I'd be really upset but wouldn't try to blame my free dog walker for what her friend's kid did.  I'd blame the kids' mom.", "She\u2019s responsible for teaching her kids how to interact with pets if she\u2019s allowing them around pets. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP should be going after Beth, because he\u2019s not going to get the money from her it seems and it\u2019s just going to cause issue with his girlfriend and her new friend. \n\nBut that does not mean Beth isn\u2019t partly responsible.", "The second you allow an animal and a child to interact without strict supervision any generous interpretation goes out the window as far as I'm concerned. That's the golden rule of dog owning is to not allow it unsupervised with any kids and to do so is to knowingly take a huge risk. That piece makes it not a mistake to me.", "This is what happened.  Beth and my GF were chatting at the dining room table and Beth's kids wanted a snack.  They were playing in the next room and my dog was wandering between the 2 rooms.  Kids started tossing my dog grapes so that he could catch them in his mouth, they thought it was a game.", "I can concede the GF is responsible but the end of the post is about how OP won\u2019t give up wanting to confront the friend, to the point that his GF is begging him not to as it would jeopardize her only friendship. That\u2019s out of line and he absolutely shouldn\u2019t bring this up to her friend or expect her friend to pay anything", "This debate reminds me of learning about proximate cause in law school.", "I stand by my opinion that it was a mistake but still 100% needs to be corrected. Things aren't just that black and white; context matters. Beth and gf were still wrong and need to make it right. It doesn't mean they had any ill intent. And if people want to downvote me for having a more grey opinion about this, fine.", "i think you\u2019re conflating \u201cmistake\u201d with \u201cexcuse\u201d. it was a mistake, an awful mistake that almost came at the cost of a life, but still a mistake nonetheless. it being a mistake is just the explanation, the reason was ignorance on the kids behalf (they didnt know and theyre not at fault) and negligence on GFs/Beth\u2019s behalf, but none of that excuses the negligence of the GF and Beth. \n\neven though it was a mistake, they are both at fault, and one of them needs to pay the bill.", "Wait; your gf knew the kids had snacks and didn\u2019t keep an eye on the dog around them?!\n\nEven if she didn\u2019t know Beth had given her kids grapes, she should know that small kids+snacks+dog=dog eating things it shouldn\u2019t.", "Fellow law school grad here myself.  I can't believe it's a debate.  People just want to crucify GF so bad that they can't see the difference between direct action and indirect action and assume I'm saying she's 100% not at fault."]}
