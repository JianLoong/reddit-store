When I got the job I asked her if she wanted to move to the new city with me and she agreed.  She quit her job to come with me and I told her I can support us both while she looks for a new job.  She said that she wanted to also focus on finishing a book she's been working on while looking for a job at the same time.  We moved here about 6 months ago.\n\nI have a 10-year-old dog that I have had since college.  He's a smaller dog, only about 25 pounds.  Since my GF is at home during the day, she takes him for walks.  She met a single mom, Beth, on one of her walks and they quickly became friends.  I was elated that my GF was able to find someone to make the new city more comfortable for her.  \n\nLast Saturday, my GF took my dog over to Beth's house while I was working on a home improvement project.  She was there for 3-4 hours.  Early Sunday morning, my dog began acted weird.  I asked my GF is anything happened at Beth's house the day before, like if he had eaten anything he shouldn't have.  \n\nMy GF called Beth and Beth confirmed that she didn't see my dog eat anything.  I asked my GF to ask Beth if she had given her kids grapes as a snack while my dog was there.  I saw my GF's face turn white on the phone.  After she hung up, she said that Beth had given her kids grapes as snacks and her 4-year-old told her that they were playing a game with the dog and giving him grapes.  They have no idea how many my dog ate.\n\nI immediately took my dog to the emergency vet.  The started treatment immediately but wanted to keep him for observation.  He ended up needing to stay for over 48 hours, but he'll live.  There is still a very high possibility that he will have life-long complications because no one knows how many grapes he had.  The total bill is almost $5K.  \n\nI told my GF that I want her and/or Beth to either cover the cost or at least help with it.  She said that Beth is a single mom and she's not going to ask her to help pay for such a huge bill.  She also said that she doesn't have that kind of money because she hasn't found a job yet.  I told her that it's time she gets a job ASAP then. \n\nShe started making excuses about how the kids didn't know what they were doing so it really is just an accident.  I told her that if her and Beth had actually been watching my dog and the kids then this wouldn't have happened, and since they were the 2 adults in the situation, it was on them to properly supervise the kids and dog.  She said it's unreasonable of me to expect Beth to pay so much for an accident.\n\nI told her that if my dog had injured one of Beth's kids, then obviously I would be expected to help pay for any costs related to that, so I don't see how this is any different.  She is refusing to even ask Beth to pay and is begging me not to confront Beth about it on my own because she doesn't want to lose her only friend here.", "created_utc": 1671029232, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlsuu6/aita_for_expecting_my_gf_andor_her_friend_to_pay/", "score": 1081, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think the responsibility should be on Beth. However, your girlfriend is a bit of a different story. I don't think that there should have to be an additional financial burden on you when the problem didn't arise from you. You've already taken on the financial burdens for an extended period of time at this point and I don't think asking your girlfriend to chip into the vet expenses is out of line. That is with the caveat that you are not doing it in a mean way. I do believe that she dropped the ball on this one a little bit and should have made sure that the dog was safe, but with that being said accidents happen. She needs to help make up for that accident though.", "NTA it's just like you said if your dog had injured one of her kids, even if on accident, she would be demanding compensation.

Beth should not be held responsible for your girlfriend's negligence.", "NTA. \n\nYour girlfriend made the choice to take the dog to Beth's house, so she is responsible for actually taking care of the dog. \n\nI wouldn't confront Beth either, by the way, because this is fully on your girlfriend.

She should know what dogs can and can't eat, and shouldn't have left the kids unsupervised with the dogs. \n\n6 months is plenty of time to find a job, particularly in this economy (at least in most places) so please realize your girlfriend is happy to just sit around all day letting you support her. I live in a major city, and I could walk in to literally any restaurant, coffee shop, or bar - retail too- and get a job that day. Trust me, I wouldn't have said that 3 years ago and have struggled to find work myself before, so I am not being uppity or out of touch about this. And of course, if the country you are in is different, ignore me. \n\nTell your girlfriend no more dog at Beth's house, and that she needs to get a job in the next month and she needs to pay you back, at least for half. In the meantime, she doesn't get money for anything that isn't a necessity, and if you were giving her any \"fun money\" that is going to go to the vet bills until she gets a job. To be clear, she needs to eat, she needs a cell phone, etc. so I'm not saying financial abuse. But she doesn't need to go out for coffee, get her hair or nails done, go out for drinks, etc. because you are out $5k and it needs to start coming from somewhere. \n\nStuff like this happens in life, but it is how we handle it that matters. BTW we used to try and feed my dogs grapes because we didn't know they were bad (pre solid internet, in the AOL dial up days) so I can sympathize. If I were your girlfriend, I would just tell you- \"please don't confront Beth, I didn't know grapes were bad for dogs and this is fully on me.  I am working on getting a job and will of course cover this bill.

You are also responsible for letting your dog go to someone else's home where you weren't able to monitor it. Sure, you expected your GF to monitor him, but all dog people know that non-dog people don't know any of the important information of raising a dog or keeping it alive. \n\nI think all of you should pay to cover the costs, but if your girlfriend wants to cover Beth's portion, let her. At the same time, don't let your GF take your dog again without being educated on foods that aren't allowed to be fed to dogs.

Children should be supervised when around any animal, for the animal's safety more-so than theirs. It sound like your girlfriend has become too preoccupied with making friends around town, rather than acting like an adult. An adult does not take 6 months to find a job and laze about(idc about the little book she is writing.) This could have killed your pup! She and the other woman need to take responsibility and cover the fine. If she doesn't want to do so, it might be in your best interest to dump the dead weight and find a more mature companion who understands actions have consequences, as does shirking responsibilities. Maybe she can go live with her new friend she wants to protect?

Though I\u2019d argue it\u2019s your girlfriends responsibility to pay you back and not Beth. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was an accident or not, since when does an accident make you free of any responsibility?\n\nAlso, the excuse that the girlfriend didn\u2019t know is BS. You don\u2019t just let a dog eat anything without at least doing a quick search to see whether or not it\u2019s safe? It\u2019s called common sense, which really isn\u2019t all that common.", "NTA I AM LIVID on your behalf! Omg I am so sorry, I hope your dog makes a full recovery. This must be so horrible. Absolutely they or your gf should cover the cost. If she does not make an effort then it\u2019s time to save some money by not continuing to financially support her.", "This is a tough one. I'm going to go NTA but only just. \n\nFirstly to, the people here that are calling you TA because they don't know what is and isn't safe for dogs to eat: dogs aren't people; people are generalists in a dietary sense and unlike most animals, can eat damn near anything, while the same cannot be said of dogs. If you give a dog \"human\" food, make sure it's safe for them to eat - that's just the responsible thing to do. That tip applies to pretty much any animal one might keep as a pet.\n\nSecondly, it sounds like your GF was doing you a favor in getting the dog out of your hair while you were doing house renovations. She was under no obligation to take your doggone over there, but she did. She is, however, in the wrong for not adequately supervising your four-legged friend. She knew dogs shouldn't eat grapes, though she might not have known the kids were feeding them to the dog. That said, she's unemployed. I agree that your GF at the very least needs to help out with some of the vet bills.\n\nThe friend, though? She's a struggling single parent with no knowledge of what dogs can and can't eat, same with her kids. I feel asking for her to compensate you is unlikely to come to fruition, and honestly a wasted effort. Don't let your dog go over there again. She was under no obligation to watch your dog, but is responsible for her kids. When the kids mentioned the game they were playing, she should have checked that grapes were safe to eat, but she didn't. Ideally, due to that, she ought to help pay as well, but again it might not be worth it to pursue that. \n\nPersonally, I'd bring it up to GF that once she has a job, you expect some recompense for the vet bills, but a fair amount, not the whole thing. Find a number that works for you both, and maybe a repayment plan, as well. And then take the money she pays you back and put it in a separate account for future vet bills, should they arise.", "INFO\n\nBecause I'm confused not necessarily because it'll affect my judgement, what made you think to ask if Beth had supplied her kids with grapes? That question seemed to come out of nowhere.", "NTA\n\nYeah, the kids didn't know what they were doing. That's why you're not blaming the kids or asking them for money. You're blaming the adults who could have prevented the situation. \n\nIf $5k is unobtainable for Beth, she and your GF can split the cost and pay you back over time. Low repayments, interest free. I bet that's a far more generous offer than Beth would give you if her child were injured.", "This is a really hard one honestly. A lot of people don\u2019t know that grapes are toxic for dogs, so I genuinely believe this was an accident. I\u2019m going with NAH. \n\nYou are the one who took your GF to a new city and told her she didn\u2019t need an income. You\u2019re the reason she\u2019s trying to make friends. And it\u2019s you who rushed the dog to the vet because he\u2019s ultimately your responsibility. You would have been an AH for not taking him, but it was your choice to take an uninsured pet to the emergency vet. His bills and his care fall to you. It\u2019s not fair to ask anyone else to be responsible for the cost of your pet.\n\nI do think you should tell Beth because it\u2019s doubtful she understands the harm that was done.

Until I started a relationship with a dog owner, I had no idea how many things could literally kill a dog that humans could eat with no ill effects. I understand why you're angry - your dog almost died, it cost you a bomb to treat it and it might have life-long complications but no one here did anything malicious. A dog is in some ways like a toddler. You wouldn't leave your toddler with people you weren't completely happy knew what they were doing. This is no different. An even better analogy is to leave a toddler with food allergies with people who are not aware of what they are nor how dangerous they could be. You might not want to hear this but stuff like this happens.", "NAH. you are supporting your GF right now as she looks for jobs so it\u2019s unrealistic to expect her to pay for the vet bills.

There are ways to compromise on it a little though, if you're willing, considering the circumstances.\n\nFirst of all, talk to the vet's office and see if there's any possibility of a payment plan, if you haven't done so already. Secondly, let your girlfriend know that if she isn't going to ask Beth about helping with the bill, then you expect her to cover at least 50% of it herself (or otherwise the minimum % you're willing to accept), and if she has to take a really shit job to do that, then that you'd be okay with her quitting that one as soon as the bill is payed for, and go back to the original plan you two had. You may have been willing to let her move at her own pace on getting a job before, but this is an emergency situation and a cost you hadn't accounted for when that plan was made.\n\nIf she changes her tune about asking Beth, maybe the three of you could split the amount evenly. You could have Beth make a payment plan with YOU, so that you get the money without it risking her ability to care for herself and her children.\n\nMake sure that you get any agreement that you come to with either of them in writing, in case for some reason you end up needing to take either to small claims court in the future.

Also, save any and all text conversations you might have with your girlfriend about the situation, again just in case.

She should be responsible for all the medical costs. \n\nThe friend Beth has a responsibility to now be informed and educated on the dangers of certain foods being fed to dogs, all pets really, by her children. While she is not directly financially responsible for what her kids actions caused the kids did not intentionally set out to make your dog sick.

That  amount would be at the very lower edge of toxicity, and two children that size are not given more that 3 ounces of grapes at a time. I have trouble that particular detail being wrong. Raisins would have been a better toxic grapelike material since the amount needed is far less.  A raisin is a dried grape.\n\nThis seems to me as a possible work of creative writing.  If so, good job.", "I woke up one morning and walked into the kitchen to find out that my boyfriend had been tossing grapes to all three of the dogs in my house (one mine, two belonging to housemates).

This incident led to me printing and posting a list of toxic foods for dogs and birds on the fridge, which I should have done way earlier in hindsight.\n\nQueue me waking up my housemates followed by hydrogen peroxide-induced vomiting and then a day of practically force-feeding all three activated charcoal wrapped in lunch meat followed by bowls of chicken broth and canned pumpkin to absorb/dilute/force out what leftovers we could. The housemates refused to go to a vet and BARELY took me seriously about the grapes. I knew I had to work fast since it had already been a while since they had eaten the grapes, so I got to work immediately with all of the dogs instead of skipping town with mine. I called my mom and got on the line with her vet friend, and then we had a real gross day.", "Thing is, if your GF doesn't have the money - she doesn't have the money.

(Its a very sucky truth, unfortunately.) Your GF should have paid attention to the dog as one would a baby, certainly, because that's the life you live when you have a pet. Its unlikely that your GF already knew that she has to childproof the dog around kids because unsupervised kids make mistakes.

They don't understand that grapes poison dogs, because they're little kids, after all.)\n\nSo, while \"blame\" rests with these adults, I still bet neither their mom or your GF realized that a dog's needs are as great as any child's?

Most people don't know pet insurance is a thing and even if he had found out in the last few years AFTER his dog's lifestyle changed most pet insurances wouldn't cover his dog because it was already considered a senior. Also, I know plenty of house cats that are prone to UTIs so they would benefit MORE from having insurance. My partner and I looked into pet insurance and decided it was more economical for us to simply have a pet emergency fund because the insurance had so many loopholes we didn't feel it was worth it. In fact, I'm positive this would have been considered a human negligence act and therefore WOULDN'T have been covered under the insurance companies I looked at. If someone accidentally poisoned my dog or injured him I would 100% be able to cover the bill but I would still go after them if the accident was due to negligence (texting, drunk driving, letting people feed my dog without permission) vs a freak fucking accident (icy road, dog getting loose, dog getting into pantry, purse).\n\nNowhere does he say he's freaking out about money or struggling so that implies he paid the bill in full or is using care credit or another credit source.

Especially considering the kids and dogs don't live together and haven't known each other long?\n\nNTA, OP. The dog and kids were supposed to be supervised by at least one of the two adults. It's due to Beth and your GF's negligence that the kids and dog were alone together, the kids fed the dog grapes without an adult stopping them, and that the dog got sick.

You may also want to check into CareCredit. it's a credit card designed for medical and vet expenses. A charge over $200 (i think) gets you like 6 months no interest to pay it off.

Those kids shouldn't have been able to feed the dog more than one, MAYBE two grapes before an adult stepped in to correct the situation."]}
