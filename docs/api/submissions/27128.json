Literally no one includes \u201cand what if there\u2019s a car accident in front of us on the way there\u201d when organizing the drive to a venue. Shit happens that literally no one can control for. It\u2019s all fine and good to hate people being late, but jfc, we\u2019ll all be late eventually due to forces outside our control.", "Totally agree. My 35-yr-old son has autism (mid-functioning). We taught him boundaries. Some of his peers were not and it shows.", "Absolutely. This young woman has the wherewithal to provide a printed list of behavioral expectations of others. Yes, self-reflection may be lagging compared to other cognitive skills, but I feel like she has enough to work with here lol", "I mean it\u2019s hard to say he\u2019s completely right without knowing more details. Like how much did the crash delay them? Because a wedding isn\u2019t just any event so I would expect the parents to allow a lot of extra time.", "Good point but whenever this happens with my nephew my brother picks up the phone and calls to tell us what\u2019s going on.", "Autism is not an excuse for the DILs behavior. It's not an excuse to be unreasonable with others and berrate them for things out of their control. Source: I'm an autistic female and don't use my autism as an excuse (it may help explain things at times, but it's not an excuse). If I do something shitty, then I need to own up to it and correct myself. I'm really tired of autistic people using autism as an excuse. \n\nIf the DIL was dealing with a meltdown, the son could've called and explained the situation or at the very least said they were going to be late. Sounds like the DIL and son only care about punctuality going one way. \n\nNTA", "Well yeah, but this is like that \u201cyou don\u2019t have a MIL problem, you have a husband problem\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not about gender. It\u2019s if your partner is an AH to your parents and you allow it, you\u2019re an AH too. And if your parents are an AH to your partner and you allow it, you\u2019re an AH. \n\nNo need to whine about gender stuff.", "Check and check!", "I dunno, I think if something major happened and OP is leaving it out, that's pretty telling. Like yeah, I understand the n t a votes if DIL also just got stuck in traffic, but if it was something like \"her mom who lives with them had a stroke and had to be rushed to the hospital\", for example, it would at very least be e s h, imo.", "They're saying ESH because calling her a hypocrite (factually correct) is \"name calling\".", "OP sticking around for an hour just so he could eventually tell them to fuck off was an asshole thing to do.\n\nNot that the DIL didn't deserve it, mind you, but being an asshole is being an asshole.", "Thank you!", "That's a decent explanation, but DIL's boundary is for herself as well, 'I don't accept when people are late\" and she is exercising her boundary by asking them to leave ('stop being friends'). \n\nTo add to this definition to explain why DILs boundary feels more like a controlling thing than a boundary is that boundaries are supposed to protect your liveliness. Your health, mental health, security. DIL might get annoyed when people are late, but when being (slightly) late isn't causing her to sacrifice herself, then it's not really a boundary so she is being controlling. \n\nInterestingly enough, OP played out the DILs boundary correctly.  'I have something I need to do, so I cannot wait for you because you are late, so I must leave now. Have a good day'", "Very thoughtful reply. So many on here use the term but don't quite fit that scenario by going on to push the other person's actions.", "I appreciate the reply and info!", "I\u2019m sorry. The wedding would have had a delay if the parents were behind a wreck. My son\u2019s wedding was late because of a crash. Almost half the guests were behind it.", "Yeah.  She's using autism as an excuse but it is not.  It is an explanation and a reason why she might need to do things differently.  But she doesn't get act like an A H and to make everyone else around her continually jump through hoops.\n\nHer demand list is crazy and unreasonable.\n\nNTA.", "My mother came so late to her OWN wedding that my dad thought she\u2019d changed her mind. Turns out everyone forgot the (still new) NYC Pride parade was happening that day and and added about five hours to the trip.\n\nI once left for work two hours early to avoid being late due to traffic. I came three hours late. Some idiot misjudged a turn while going 80 mph on the Belt and sent debris across the entire highway. No one moved for HOURS stuck between two exits.\n\nStuff happens. Even when you plan for extra time 1 in a million type stuff can happen that makes you insanely late.", "I have had friends stuck 5+ hours in traffic because of a crash before. Sadly, lives were lost and they were about 200m from the front so they got jammed there for so long that the shift they had been driving to had almost ended when the police reopened the road. It was an early shift too so it was all morning traffic caught in it. It happens.", "I mean I was making the drive from my hometown back to college and got in horrible traffic for over 2 hours from a wreck. I make this drive all the time, and it wound up taking me six hours to get from Charlotte to Raleigh (normally it\u2019s just under three hrs). Depending on how bad it is, crashes can double your travel time and there is nothing you can do about it.", "I never said it was an excuse- just that it could still fit within the experience you have with similar behaviours.", "That depends on the nature of their relationship. I imagine I'd like to be very involved in my kids' weddings, but what if my future DIL/SIL didn't want me involved in that way?", "In a congested city someone could be 15 minutes away before a large accident and 2 hours away if they're in the middle of it.", "What about the accident making OP late? No fault of hers and DIL didn't let it go.", "Unless her arm was being chewed off by a rabid bear holding  her at gunpoint at the behest of an ancient warlock who was revived by a sacred incantation it's ***BULLSHIT***  because an actual car accident wasn't a good enough excuse for op being late.", "oh ok", "But it\u2019s not really for herself if she\u2019s expecting people to abide by it and punishing them for not obeying. Those are rules.", "I remember hearing \u201cI have autism, what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d, which I thought was BS. No disability gives someone an excuse to be an AH. Even being around a lot of people on the spectrum, I would have no patience with your DIL.", "Well yeah, that\u2019s why I\u2019m wondering whether it was something like you\u2019re saying or whether they only allowed 30 minutes or an hour extra.", "My whole point is that a parent not being involved in the wedding is indicative of more going on than is being said.", "Yeah but if I need to set a boundary that says no one can be rude to me, and someone talks rudely to me so I ask them to leave, I'm also expecting someone to abide by it and punishing them for not doing so. \n\nThe difference is what you are 'sacrificing' I think. If you have to sacrifice something of yourself to appease the behavior you don't like, then you set a boundary. If the behavior you don't like doesn't actually damage your security, self respect, health, or  mental health, then it's a rule.", "Or the son! Imagine his life and he signed on to it! LOL", "Assuming the post is fake, because no one is worth that hassle, but answering you because you seem to be genuinely insane.", "Nah the \"doctor\" deserves the downvotes. No one tell them how to delete comments", "Unless it\u2019s due to a stated issue \u2014 DIL is extremely difficult to be around.", "A boundary is something you can enforce. If someone is rude to you in your home, you can require that they leave. If someone is rude to you in public, where both of you have an equal right to be, then its up to you to leave.", "Babe, I know how to delete comments. I'm choosing not to because the person I was talking to has seen my apology (or blocked me, which, fair enough) at which point all deleting the comment would do is make the now-contextless replies confusing and/or annoying to read for everyone else.\n\nI'm a big girl, I can take some downvotes.", "I personally still wouldn't let myself be late to my own kids wedding.", "Oh hun bless your heart for being a good sport about it. But there's no need for a condescending \"babe\" to be tossed out. It just makes things worse for ya", "Are you going to spontaneously develop the ability to fly?", "Your ideals do not apply here.\n\nYour ideals are unrealistic and you will fail to achieve them. \n\nYou do not control the future or understand the concept of changing circumstances and life will frustrate you. \n\nYour idea of what your priorities might be in a hypothetical event are more meaningless."]}
