She is currently employed but she's looking for something that has more \"normal hours\" as she's working late evenings at the moment. A few days ago one of the receptionists at my company put in her 2 week notice and I told my girlfriend about it. We were just talking about work and I just casually mentioned it. She then got all excited and said I should just hire her. I told her I'd think about it but in reality I knew I didn't want to hire her but I just wanted to think of a way to tell her nicely. So the next day I told her that I'm not going to hire her. And I explained my reasoning to her. \n\nMy biggest issue with having her work for me is that in our relationship we're obviously equal to each other. But at work I would be her boss and I just think having this kind of dynamic where we walk into work and I turn into her superior and then after work we're back to being equal could ruin our relationship. And also the fact that I don't want to be the kind of couple that spend 24/7 with each other. I love my fiance and I love spending time with her but I don't want to spend every second of every day together because I know from personal experience in previous relationships that it will lead eventually to boredom in our relationship. After I explained all that to her she got upset with me and said I was being childish. We argued about this for quite a while. It's been a few days and things between us are kind of \"cold\". And I'm starting to wonder if maybe I was an asshole? So AITA?\n\nAlso in case ages are relevant here, I'm 29 and my fiance is 24.

You're showing excellent emotional intelligence.", "NTA.  It\u2019s a tricky situation and I think you handled it pretty well.  Your point about the power dynamic issue is a really solid one, and one that she may not fully appreciate if she hasn\u2019t been out in the \u201c9-5\u201d workforce as much.", "Nta.. having 2 paychecks coming from the same company, can mean financial problems, if something happens to the company.\n\nShe isnt going to like, you being her boss, for very long, and she will also see her position being More than it is, BeCauese of you being in a relationship with her..\n\nYoure absolutely right and rational/logical, in your views about not working with her..\n\nMy opinion only adds to your thoughts.  Youre in the right mind about it.\n\nDont do it", "NTA - my mom has hated my dad for 35 years because he fired her .", "NTA. Mixing work with people you live with rarely goes well ime, and that's just with friends.", "NTA.\n\nYour reasons for not hiring her are 1000% valid. It really would be weird to alternate between an equal relationship outside of work and a boss/employee relationship at work. \n\nYour reasons are far from childish", "NTA \n\nYou have very valid reasons for not wanting to hire her. Another thing is that people in the work place might claim you are treating her differently just because she is your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is letting her job desperation affect her view on this. Is she even qualified for the job, or does she just want you to give her the job?\n\nIf you don\u2019t own the company then maybe ask your owner and confirm that your owner is against it, then you can say \u201chey babe I asked my owner and they said they won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t let an engaged or married couple be in a power dynamic at work for reasons you mentioned.", "NTA\n\nYou made the right choice both professionally and for your relationship.\n\nEven if you were in a position where you wouldn't work with her directly, whoever she was working under would know she's \"the boss's wife\"(or fiance in this situation, until you are married) and would automatically treat her unfairly compared to other employees. This is just a recipe for a toxic work environment, and you dodged that bullet.\n\nSecondly, when you told her your reasoning behind it, generally I read it as that you were uncomfortable at the idea of it. She said your feelings were childish. To me, this is where she became the \"AH\" (and why it's not NAH). You omitted the details of the argument, so I can't say with 100% certainty, but I honestly feel like she's projecting. She's the one acting childish in this situation.", "NTA you are clever enough to know not to shit where you eat", "NTA. You are absolutely correct in worrying about how her working for you would go. Mixing family/relationships and business has a lot of potential to go horribly.", "NTA. People underestimate how much managing has to be done between a manager and employee. How do you think a 1 on 1 will go if one of you has a problem with the other? I can be honest with my manager because we have very defined relationship lines. This would not be the case with you two.\n\nWhat happens the day you need to sit her down and discuss a real issue with her performance? There's no chance that doesn't bleed over into your personal relationship. Vice versa as well. When I'm frustrated with my boss, the first person I tell in the evening is my SO. Hiring your fiance will eliminate this for both of you. Your fiance is wildly underestimating how this will change your entire relationship dynamic.", "NTA - it sounds like you\u2019ve given this a lot of thought in terms of how this could change your relationship dynamic. \n\nThat said: my personal concern would be that she starts \u201cmaking decisions\u201d for you based upon what she wants. Early evening  meetings rescheduled because she wants to leave early and is carpooling with you. \n\nMy SO and I decided we could never work together. Though we also had slightly offset work schedules to account for child transportation.\n\nTBH - it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s looking for a specific career / job, just better hours.", "NTA. She has a job and she can find something else. However, is this a business you own or do you work for a company and you\u2019re just the manager?", "NTA I agree with how you've handled it. You also don't say if she has the right experience?", "NTA", "NTA. You do not have to hire your fianc\u00e9e. You already explained why you don\u2019t feel comfortable, and you\u2019re right\u2014it\u2019s better not to mix personal and professional lives. She\u2019ll get over it when she finds something she likes more.", "NTA. You're setting a boundary. Also, don't shit where you eat. If she's so upset now, imagine her being problematic while on the clock.", "NTA.! Don\u2019t hire her! Very few married couples can handle an arrangement where one is the others boss.  And any conflicts at work will end up being rehashed at home and ultimately affect your relationship.  You will never get away from your job.  And on some level your fianc\u00e9 will expect you to take her side in any conflicts that develop with coworkers.  You\u2019ll end up in a situation where you will either be accused of nepotism or ruin you relationship by siding with someone against your fianc\u00e9.", "Nta.  \n\nNever work with family. Especially a spouse.  Nothing good will come of it.", "NTA. Sorry, but I didn't read your whole post. In my opinion, it's not a good idea to work with your romantic partner.

My wife and I have worked together, from our home, in a business that we own together, for the last 10 years or so. It's been mostly great - we both have flexible work schedules, we can work from anywhere so we can travel and work around our kids schedule, etc. \n\nThat being said, being with your SO basically 24 hours a day can get old and stressful. She and I have been together for 30 years, so we are very comfortable in our relationship, but there have been strains to the point where we've gone to counseling together (not just for the work stuff, but it has contributed). \n\nPutting that kind of stress on a younger relationship and inside an environment where other people are involved seems like a risky proposition.", "NTA and she is proving your gut feeling of why this wouldn't work true. My Wife and I have both worked from home together for the last five years (eight for me). Luckily, we have a large home and are able to be physically distant while working.

I have worked in places where a person was in a relationship with their manager, and it always ended up being fiercely difficult for the other manager's reports, because this supposedly equal colleague had the manager's ear all the damn time.  Even Sensible Manager will start making bad decisions about their other reports if Relationship Report is badmouthing them about personal things, and we all need to go home and unload about our colleagues occasionally.\n\nI have seen a reasonably good engineer promoted to a management position where they were \\[expletive\\] useless, because they were having an affair with the manager one level up.

Sorry to hear this.", "Not only that, but in this economy (it sucks all over the world), why would anyone want to have all of their income reliant on one employer. I know too many people who had the same employer/job as their spouse. Auto companies go on strike/have layoffs, healthcare jobs take a hit every time Medicare changes their reimbursement rates, and hours get cut/restructuring happens, restaurants go out of business/have slow periods so hours get cut and all of a sudden a 2 income family is a zero income family.

Is she not capable of getting a job anywhere else?", "Forget the power dynamic.  The \"perception of favoritism\" is one of the biggest management issues that most businesses have to deal with.
