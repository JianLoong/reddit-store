We have two sweet kids, ages 5 and 9, and we all live in a house in a nice small typical Scandinavian town.\n\nOur economy is mostly shared - more on this in a bit.\n\nI'm an engineer, working as consultant. Great pay and benefits. I make more than I spend.\n\nMy wife has a masters degree in human communication - a horribly useless degree, even according to herself. \n\nSince graduating something like 8 years ago, she has been unable to find a job in her field. Note: Those 8 years does include her second pregnancy and maternity leave.\n\nHere is the thing. My wife has very wealthy parents (like no-financial-worries-at-all wealthy). Thanks to them, her share of our house was gifted to her (I still pay mortgage on my share). They gifted her a brand new car (I drive my own). Each Christmas, they gift her $20.000 - her, not me. Besides that yearly gift, she has more or less been without income for most of her adult life, including when she attended university. She did hold a few odd jobs here and there.\n\nWe share all family related expenses (utilities, food, insurances, vacations, kids stuff and so on) through a shared account - 50/50. Besides that, we have our own accounts. But many purchases goes toward the family/house/kids anyway, so its not like air tight. You know how it is.\n\nMy wife recently got a part time job (15-20 hours/week) in a clothing store. Pay is terrible, hours are weird and she doesn't get along with the owner. Therefore, she is considering quitting. I'm telling her to go ahead, but also that even a bad job pays better than no job. In my opinion, she is a little picky with jobs. Won't do cleaning, elderly care and other stuff like that, despite those being jobs she is able to get without any qualifications. She keeps applying for jobs in her own field, but so far without any luck besides a couple of first round interviews. The market is VERY limited.\n\nBecause of increased cost of living (you all know the story), her yearly gift and small paycheck doesn't quite cut it anymore. She tells me that she is barely making ends meet. Therefore, she has asked me to help her out, by paying a larger share of our shared expenses.\n\nI basically said no.\n\nI told her that not many people are as privileged as her and that she really should be less picky - or even consider requalification (new education and/or field of work). I felt bad telling her, but also needed to be honest with her. I could help her out, but that just doesn't sit right with me, all things considered.\n\nSo now of course, according to her, I'm an asshole. But am I?\n\nEDIT based on comments: My wife did full child care for both kids (one year of maternity leave per child). As of now, F9 goes to school and M5 is in kindergarten.

I'll probably get downvoted, but this is why having separate finances in marriage is a really, really bad idea. You guys are married, you have kids, you're meant to be a team. It's absurd that you've been paying a mortgage payment on 'your half' of the house, and that she keeps $20k annual gift to herself. It's also absurd that you have a great job, she's working a very low-wage job, and you expect to keep splitting things 50/50 like you're roommates. 'Helping her out' doesn't 'sit right' with you because you've been treating each other badly for so long. This whole arrangement needs an overhaul, and apologies from both of you.", "ESH.\n\nThis is a weird situation. You're married. You're supposed to be a team, partners. And yet, you're the only paying for the mortgage on the house, and you expect her to pay half of everything despite the fact that she probably only get a low paying job like cleaning or taking care of ederly people. \n\nAs a married couple, you should be living with what you can earn yourselves and not above your means. I don't get how you both let things got that far. \n\nYou two need to sit down and make some serious changes to the way you've been living your lives. Do you even still love her and want to be married to her ?", "NTA, but you said your wife's parents are wealthy. They will not live forever. If your wife inherits their money when they pass, are you going to be willing to accept it if your wife tells you that you still have to pay your half of everything on your own? Will you be ok if she takes a vacation and you can't afford to go because your half costs more than you can afford?", "INFO: How is child care and housework divided up? Because as a household you have to consider all the ways you both contribute to determine what a fair split would be.", "Wow your relationship is that transactional ???? Wow", "Good luck with the divorce, should be pretty easy since you have basically already lived your life 50/50.  This is not a marriage, it\u2019s a roommate situation.", "What would you do if she could not cover her part of the 50% anymore? Let her go hungry?", "So what... you're \"teaching your wife a life-lesson\".  Sounds a bit patronising.\n\nAlso, if (as sounds like the case) your wife did the majority of the child care, that's a large part of the reason you are now \"earning more than you spend\".\n\nI think the general idea is that you're meant to love your wife more than your bank-balance.\n\nYTA", "ESH, but mostly YTA tbh\n\nShe have been having a hard time finding a job since after your child birth, and her working area is limited and hard to find jobs, so you knew about that before you married her and before you got her pregnant. \n\nShe is taking the worst part of the situation since you want her to pay 50/50 even though you made the situation getting harder for her even though you got her pregnant twice and blames her for not finding a job in her field knowing pretty well about her work situation. \n\nAlso it seems that your wife coming from a wealthy family is annoying to you. You seem to want to see her \"suffering\" to be a common person. Is it some sort of insecurity because she is from a wealthy background while you are not?\n\nRemember that the worry free lifestyle you are having is also thanks to her parents, not everyone have rich parents in law that help woth paying a house and helping with your economic situation even though you seem to believe they are just helping your wife, no they are helping you two and your children.\n\nYou are also privileged and don't seem to acknowledge that. If your wife didn't have wealthy parents you wouldn't have such carefree life as you are having. You would have to pay 100% of your expenses in your house since she lost her job and got pregnant twice.\n\nYeah I changed my mind you are definitely the AH here.", "Your wife is a homemaker who came with a stipend, and you're counting pennies with her? You should be ahamed. Sounds like the only reason having your kids hasn't sent her stright to poverty is her rich parents. Good on them. You haven't given her a house, not even a quarter of one, you aren't supporting her, you haven't given her a car. While she's giving borth to and raising your kids, having to rely on her parents. And you still find something to complain about?? YTA big time.", "ESH. You are married and a team, there\u2019s no reason to keep finances separate, unless a divorce is impending. \n\nY\u2019all need to come to an agreement on money. Obviously you earn significantly more, but she\u2019s done a lot of unpaid work in raising the kids.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised your wife can\u2019t find a job. I know two communication majors. One has a decent job at a bank and the other is working at some company. Not fabulous jobs, but way better than random retail. Maybe \u201chuman communication\u201d is something different?", "So your family lives in a home that cost you half the going rate, her car is paid for, you make a good income and your wife\u2019s parents toss 20k a year towards your budget?  Why are you complaining?", "How does this even workout practically? You say no to her and\u2026then just sort of watch as your wife and mother of your children struggles and her quality of life goes down while your comfortably live in the same household? I guess I agree with you that she may need to buck up a little bit when it comes to finding and keeping a job but I don\u2019t think you should try and \u201cteach her lesson\u201d (essentially) by refusing to help her. Helping her ultimately helps your family unit. It\u2019s like you resent the fact that her parents are generous with her or something. \n\n\nYTA.", "YTA because of the way you belittle her education. I may not be quite understanding what you mean, but if she has a communications degree that\u2019s a highly marketable degree depending how she uses it. Regardless, don\u2019t say asshole things about the love of your life.", "YTA. I'm not saying it isn't reasonable to ask her to get a job if you need the money but what planet are you on that you think that there is no child care needed for a M5 and F9!!!! Are you cooking for them, shopping for them, helping with their homework, dealing with their meltdowns, running them to their events, scheduling activities, etc? Or do you just think that once they start school there is no work involved anymore.", "Nta. She needs to realise she needs to get off her ass, instead of expecting you or her parents to continually bail. She sounds overly entitled and only willing to do the bare minimum work wise.", "YTA. She's the love of your life? Doesn't sound that way! There is NOTHING loving about the way you're treating (and talking about) the mother of your children. Your well-educated wife should go clean houses because even though you COULD help her, you just don't feel like it??? You think there's NO child care needed because your children are in school for part of the day? Are you for real?", "YTA \n\nYour actions do not say that you love your wife. You sound jealous that she has help from her parents (which granted is a privilege few have). However, 20,000 is very low for a whole year. I don\u2019t blame her for wanting to keep it especially since she was taking care of your children (which IS a full time job!). \n\nFurther you belittle her over her career. If you are doing fine and her parents are giving her money why should she have to take back breaking labor like elderly care? It\u2019s commonly called a terrible job. Further I worked retail for 10 years and let me tell you I\u2019ll never deal with another customer if I can help it! Those low paying jobs are often riddled with mental abuse and a lot of grueling physical labor. \n\nRight now, as many pointed out, you are treating your life partner as a roommate. You are not poor, and you are in a tough situation. It sounds in fact like you  have a lot of unfair ideas that your wife should have to suffer in some way because she comes from wealth.", "The amount of comments here, that don't understand the living way of Scandinavia/most of Europe and still think they can form an opinion based of American living is funny \ud83e\udd23", "NTA\nI think people are missing that she's not paying the mortgage or a car note. Those are usually the big expenses that are all being covered by OP. So asking him to cover more isn't really fair.", "Info: how do you divide chores and childcare? What is she doing at home?", "Wow, your marriage is horrible. I don't think you even love her. YTA", "Wait...so they gave her the money for HER half of the house and you are still paying off your half?!  Am I getting this correct?!?  \nNTA.  Unless she is providing full time childcare, she is fully able to get a job and spend her own money.  Many of us have a job we don't love, but we stick with it for the pay and keep looking something that is a better fit.  If she wants to live the life of luxury,  then she should ask mommy and daddy to increase her allowance.", "Nta. \nYour wife grew up without any money management skills because of her wealth and she needed this reality check. Plus, it's probably the fact that she barely worked at 36 years old that is making her research for a job more difficult.", "Is this normal in European culture?  Married people splitting expenses 50/50?", "NTA, my husband and I have separate finances, and if you don't help her be her best self, then what will your future look like? People go through it but you aren't wrong.  Sounds like a normal conversation,  she may be upset at it, like I get when my spouse brings it up, but I get irked because I do have issues and bad habits with it so I'm sensitive but it's not it of spite. Just the reality of the life we want to lead and the future we want to build. She should face her financial issues now when it's only a minor inconvenience.  Not sure if the ESH folks see single or they just have money like that but in my opinion NTA", "YTA.\n\nChildren don\u2019t suddenly stop needing child care from their parents once they\u2019re in school. A statement like that leads me to believe your wife does the brunt of the labor with the children. \n\nYou patronize her about her degree. Something which is not valued in current society does not mean it holds no value, and then say she\u2019s only fit for something like cleaning houses or elder care. There is nothing wrong with these as careers and it\u2019s honorable work but you are clearly talking down about her when you suggest them. This woman is the love of your life?\n\nYou seem particularly envious of her coming from a privileged background, and perhaps this helps motivate your feelings and patronization in other areas. You are married with children. You live together. What is the point of separating your finances?", "NTA, assuming that she's no longer covering childcare now that the kids are in school.\n\nNow if she's the one who put her career on hold because of your kids and she's still covering the majority of chores around the house, then Y T A", "YTA. You sure that you're married? You sound like roommates who accidentally had children together.", "You have a very strange marriage. You sound more like roommates than life partners.", "After school and in the holidays F9 looks after M5 singlehandedly. No child care is needed.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your behavior is financially abusive. You have a 9 year old and a 6 year old. Your wife hasn't been unemployed since graduation because she's lazy. She's been pregnant and raising young children since she graduated, which has derailed the career potential she had. One spouse should not be financially comfortable and squirreling away extra money while the other is struggling to make ends meet. \n\n50/50 expense splitting is what you do with roommates, not your spouse. \n\nMany spouses share all income jointly and have only one account. If you want to maintain separate accounts for your personal separate expenses, each of you should get to keep a set, equal amount for your personal allowance. The rest goes into the joint account. Or, at absolute minimum, joint account contributions should be based on a percentage of income, not split evenly. For example, if you make 100,000, and she makes 50,000, and you need 75,000 to cover your joint expenses, you each pay in 50% of your income (50,000 for you, 25,000 for her).", "ESH.  The \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is mine and what\u2019s yours is ours\u201d mentality of the wife is kinda toxic, but it also really feels like OP sucks too because he railroaded her into little more than a SAHM role and is now criticizing her for suffering from the drawbacks of taking on all of the childcare, which is arguably very high value labor that she\u2019s doing for free but can\u2019t use to build her resume, so she\u2019s basically screwed for finding a job in her field.", "NTA - She never really worked in her life.

Marriage is supposed to be a partnership. YTA", "YTA", "This is 100% the answer. ESH. It's weird to see so many people start AITA stories with \"I'm married to the love of my life\" and then go on to explain a story where one or both parties treat each other poorly or like they're basically glorified roommates. \n\nYou're supposed to be partners, but it feels like both of you are only looking out for yourselves.", "This is were I'm getting hung up too. Sometimes it's not a perfect 50/50 split. And as long as the yearly $20,000 check is consistent, and she's working at least part time, at least she's bringing something to the table.
