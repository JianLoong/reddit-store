Your fiance thinks you should have contributed to spreading emergency resources even thinner instead of just taking care of it yourself, as you are fully qualified to do? \n\nAlso, that baby daddy sounds like a huge red flag", "NTA.   You're a doctor!  You delivered a baby.   Well done.  But according to the boyfriend/fiance, you were supposed to use your sway to talk the ambulance into not responding to a heart attack or critical accident victim so that they could attend a routine birth?    What's their problem?  Upset that you saw his girlfriend's vagina?   LOL how many vaginas have you seen in your practice?  100?  1000?  10,000?   Boyfriend is amazingly irrational.  But the kicker as you say is your fiance's reaction.  Sorry to say HUGE red flag there.  Anyone this side of sanity would have no issue with what you did.", "NTA.they're being weird idiots about it. Have any of them seen a delivery? There's nothing sexual about it.", ">Still, we\u2019re both being accused of inappropriate behavior.\n\nWTF?  NTA.

That her sister\u2019s delivery was safe? \n\nHow do you feel about your fianc\u00e9 after this?", "NTA im confused that you, a medical doctor, did what you needed to in a blizzard and they some how think this is inappropriate?? It seems like SIL was handling labor fine, there was no medical emergency and everything was appropriately cared for. It would've been unethical to call away an ambulance from people who legitimately  needed it and could've died in the amount of time it took to transport her to the hospital. The boyfriend and your fiance  can get bent, the fact that they can even stand there and accuse you only shows their own insecurity and immaturity. You and SIL absolutely did the right thing. I would however be rethinking my relationship with the fiance over this though.", "NTA what is it with people thinking everything is sexual.  How many doctors, nurses, and EMS see people naked on a daily basis but if your kid has a seizure or you deliver someone\u2019s baby it\u2019s creepy. And she\u2019s a nurse. What the hell is wrong with people", "NTA\n\nUsing your position to bump the line could have literally caused the death of a critical patient.", "NTA. You are a doctor and you couldn't even attempt to move her. Would they rather you have just let her give birth alone and possible die?", "NTA.  \n\nWhat a couple of weirdos.  If they think birth is remotely sexy, there's something very wrong with both of them.", "NTA. SIL says you did the right thing, yeah? Then everybody else can pound sand. \n\nThe boyfriend's rage is misogynistic, but at least explainable ('MAN SEE WOMAN'S FUN BITS BUT THAT MY WOMAN AND MY FUN BITS! MAN BAD! !'). His family is taking his side, because obviously. Your fianc\u00e9, though... she should know better than most that forcing an ambulance to come get her perfectly fine sister just so you don't see or interact with her naked undercarriage is wildly unethical. Something deeper is going on there. Misdirected anxiety? Projection? Bad plate of shellfish? Hard to say, but that's not a reasonable reaction.\n\nIn any case, good on you for taking care of your SIL during what was likely an extremely stressful experience.", "NTA your fiance is nuts, the boyfriend is nuts, and you should dump her like a number 2", "NTA\n\nI don't think in that moment your FSIL cared who was delivering that baby...it just needed to be out.", "NTA. Obviously.\n\nBF, his family, and unfortunately your fianc\u00e9 are the creepy ones.\n\nCreepy, pathetic, weird, and disgusting for turning the situation into that.\n\nShould ask them.

Sounds like there's some sibling rivalry going on.", "NTA. What was she supposed to do, \u201chold it in\u201d?  You are a dr. and you made the safest decision based on all the information. It would be different if you were someone with zero medical experience but even then an ambulance may not have been able to get there on time. Hopefully with a bit of space and everyone focusing on the new baby things will calm down and they can be thankful you were there. It\u2019s worrisome though that your fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t support you.

You had the ability to do what needed to be done and allow that ambulance to go to someone who needed it more.

Frankly, that\u2019s incredibly selfish of her, given the weather and the circumstances. If she\u2019s also in the medical field she should realize that this was not sexual or even particularly personal for you- you literally did your job. I\u2019d be seriously concerned if someone I was planning to marry had such a fundamental misunderstanding of my job, and a willingness to risk someone else\u2019s life for a petty reason.", "NTA.  This is a huge red flag about your girlfriend and her family.  You absolutely did the right thing and you hold your head high man.", "NYA I could almost see it if they were pissed about unnecessary risk or something, but this is just psycho.

As for the fiancee, well, she is choosing not to back you up for something this ridiculous, there's gonna be a pile more red flags.", "NTA you are a doctor and you did what a doctor does in an emergency. You are a hero. I cannot believe your girlfriend is jealous of this!! Not the BF how is this weird at all? Why would it have been any different at a hospital?

It's really weird that they are sexualizing the act of giving birth.", "NTA!!! I understand there are risks when a baby is being a delivered, but there was a perfectly capable doctor on site. Not all calls that day were that fortunate. It would have been selfish to call a bus away.   I apologize for being blunt, but you will never be happy in a relationship with her.

Her pregnant sister recently moved in with us, she lives in the sticks with her boyfriend (the father) but he\u2019s often away for work. The hospital she chose for the delivery is close to our home and we have plenty of room.\n\nThe other day, mom-to-be and I were home together while her boyfriend was off on a military exercise and my fianc\u00e9 was on shift 2 hours away. Our area was being hit hard by severe winter storms.\n\nI went to bed early, but woke up to my FSIL calling out my name. You guessed it, her water had broken. I have a SUV and wasn\u2019t worried about getting her to the hospital, but she was in very severe discomfort when I tried to move her and I decided it would be a bad idea to do so alone.\n\nI then called EMS and confirmed what I suspected, there was a backlog of critical emergency calls. She asked if the baby was in any danger, I didn\u2019t think it was and felt we could handle the situation. So I made her comfortable. If necessary, we would deliver at home.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all that long before baby arrived, happy, healthy and very loud. We were both over the moon, spread the good news, and not too long after we were able to get a bus out to transport them to the hospital, where her care team checked both out and determined they were in good health.\n\nHer mom, dad and youngest sister all met us at the hospital. The ladies all acted like I was superman for being there, and future FIL joked that he had a great story to tell his buddies about how his son-in-law \u201cdelivered his first grandchild in a biblical storm.\u201d My fianc\u00e9 arrived not too long after, she went right to her sister and I didn\u2019t find this weird. I eventually left to go home and rest.\n\nWhen I came back the next day, the boyfriend had returned. He saw me, got in my face and told me in no uncertain terms to \u201cGet the FUCK out before I make you!\u201d My fianc\u00e9 came up behind and said I should just head to work, I was shocked by BF and just figured my fianc\u00e9 was trying to deescalate. So I confirmed with staff that SIL and baby were okay and then headed to work at another hospital.\n\nOver the next couple of days, it all hit the fan. Boyfriend was extremely offended that I was the one to deliver my future sister-in-law\u2019s baby. He and his family find it creepy, like I basically cheated on my fianc\u00e9 with her sister, and want me to stay away from them. SIL and her family think he\u2019s acting nuts about this and feel I saved the day, they\u2019re completely on my side.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker \u2013 my fianc\u00e9 is siding with the boyfriend. She says I\u2019m a doctor and could have said something to make them send an ambulance, instead her sister and I did this together without anyone else and it \u201ccreeps her out.\u201d\n\nI have no words.. She\u2019s probably right in that I could have talked EMS into getting us priority for an ambulance as a doctor on site, but SIL and I both agree we took the best course of action.
