It just happens to be if he walks in when she\u2019s changing or in the bathroom. You people are all too damn repressed. Bodies are natural and they are in the privacy of their home doing normal every day things when their young child happens to interrupt them and see them naked. Calm the f down.", "NTA. It's not sexual and it's important for kids to have a healthy understanding of nudity. I think the best way to deal with this from the start is to narrate what you're doing like \"I'm changing my shirt\" \"I'm going to the bathroom\" etc. (Side note: it's good to narrate everything you're doing with babies of all ages). Then once they're old enough to have preferences, around 2 or 3, you start giving them choices \"I'm going to change my shirt, do you want to stay here or do you want to wait for me downstairs?\"", "Of course NTA, he\u2019s a child and your son.

I think it\u2019s a very natural thing, honestly. The fact that someone could sexualize it and make it something it\u2019s not is disturbing. It\u2019s nothing but innocence.

I don't look forward to the time when she thinks it weird and we need to work out another time to communicate in a relaxed way. Neither of us make any big deal about nudity - we don't parade around naked, but equally, we don't see it as anything to be ashamed of, and privacy is always respected.", "My son would run around shamelessly at least once a week until around 9. I talked to him about privacy and such,  he didn't much care as a kid,  but he just gradually stopped as he got older without any significant discussion.

There's something different when taking care of your bio kid and a fister child. For one, you have state agencies constantly reviewing and checking up on kids - from that standpoint it's not a normal parent/child relationship. Unless ordered by a court parents are not required to check in with CPS or any other agency who will scrutinize every move. Very similar to the adoption process in that any and everything you do will be under the agency's microscope, whereas if you want to have a kid biologically there's no questions asked.\n\nFrom what OP said these interactions are limited to her showering and having to share a single bathroom and changing clothes. Children at that age don't have a solid understanding of privacy. If OP was nonchalantly walking around the house all day nude or doing something sexual in front of the child I could then understand concern, especially for the latter.\n\nIf the husband is uncomfortable he needs to watch the child more diligently when the mother is showering or changing clothes.
