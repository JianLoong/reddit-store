It just happens to be if he walks in when she\u2019s changing or in the bathroom. You people are all too damn repressed.

It's not sexual and it's important for kids to have a healthy understanding of nudity. I think the best way to deal with this from the start is to narrate what you're doing like \"I'm changing my shirt\" \"I'm going to the bathroom\" etc. (Side note: it's good to narrate everything you're doing with babies of all ages).

I also have a 6 year old son and he isn\u2019t bothered at all. Just like you I want to normalize what bodies look like. Also just had a baby so my boobies are always out. He doesn\u2019t care at all.", "NTA. American culture is so weird sexualiaing naked bodies. Children should be given the option of their own privacy by puberty and adults can choose it for themselves, but if people are OK to be naked in front of their own children that's for them. That OP's DH is ok with his own nudity but not hers shows he's sexualising his son and that's gross.", "NTA", "I read questions like these and I wonder of they've seen malcolm in the middle. I have as a kid and as an adult. I recommend it for your husband", "NTA. You're his mother ffs. I'm petty so I'd be asking if he needs therapy for jumping straight into Oedipus territory.", "NAH\n\nThis is  one of those things that's not going to be the same for everybody. Will be acceptable for some and  not for others.", "Slightly AH. Just for not teaching your kid to respect boundaries or doors. I can see the argument  for both sides but  at the end of the day, a 6yr old is just tall enough where it is in his face if you are both standing. Why create an issue if you don't have to? Kids are curious. Just doesnt seem to teach them about respecting themselves or others. Let them be kids as long as they can.", "NAH because no your body is not to be sexualized but at the same time it\u2019s just as important to be teaching your son boundaries and privacy so he learns to respect them", "NTA\n\nNudity is part of life and you\u2019re helping your son understand it and not sexualize it.", "NTA. I grew up in a family where nudity was not a big deal. My siblings and I would go in to brush our teeth or use the toilet while my mom took a bath. None of us saw it as sexual or inappropriate. But that\u2019s because that\u2019s how we were raised. Not everyone will be comfortable with that. And that\u2019s okay. But your husband shouldn\u2019t be a hypocrite about it.", "I have a 5 and 3yr old (girl/boy) we are not a nude family by any stretch, but they have both seen husband and me getting dressed from a shower or in underwear while changing clothes. This is not weird. Also I think if you were doing no nudity it would apply to both parents not just one.", "NTA OP. Dad having his penis out in-front of son is just the same as OP being nude infront of her son. Either way they both are showing their privates at the same level. OPs husband shouldn\u2019t be such a hypocrite and shouldn\u2019t over sexualise OP nude just cuz she\u2019s a women. Plus the child is only 6 yo.", "NTA, but still kinda weird. Why are they going into your bedroom while you are getting undressed? Privacy and boundaries are still a thing.", "NTA but IMO he\u2019s getting close to the age where this needs to stop.", "My son saw me naked as late as 8 years old and he turned out just fine.", "A woman doesn\u2019t need to be walking around naked in front of her 6 year old son period, full stop, end of. You are doing some weird sexual damage to that kid for your own idea of what is normal. It\u2019s not", "I agree and I am an American.", "\u201cIt\u2019s cool because they aren\u2019t hot\u201d -shit I\u2019ve literally heard men say", "I would have been more worried about why she was asking about size, as that seems like something she might have overheard.", "Very weird take. What you just described was an incredibly normal and healthy reaction from a 4 year old regarding anatomy so I wonder why it bothered you", "I avoided those like the plague, I rather the ones that said about being the boss than those. I\u2019ve seen some that should have never been thought of yet exist.\n\nOP NTA, I only have a two year old right now but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have this happen a few times in the future because even now I can\u2019t even leave the room and him in the playpen without freaking out just to go to the bathroom.", "Lol I\u2019m Canadian and I can say that our prudishness is dependent upon where you are. More conservative/religious regions (ie Prairie provinces) tend to be hella prudish, whereas more liberal provinces are a little more relaxed.", "This is a really valid point that I hadn\u2019t considered, thank you", "Our daughter is 11 and she and my husband are the same way. They (and I) are all perfectly comfortable walking around in various states of undress for most of our weekday mornings. We don't fo out of our way to do it, but we only have one bathroom. If she ever says she's uncomfortable, we'll stop.\n\nI brought her dinner to her today. My husband was going to be late so she got to eat in front of the TV.  Piping hot, stretchy, cheesy, saucy, (did i mention hot) lasagna. She was fresh out of the shower. She had a towel sort of wrapped around her mid body. I told her that I thought lasagna required a shirt at the very least, no one likes burned boobs. She laughed and asked if I could get her a shirt.", "It's also ok to not like seeing others naked", "Totally agree! I had to have that convo with my son when he was 7/8 years old. Man, he hated it when my door was closed. It took him a while to get Mommy has boundaries and he had to wait til I gave him permission to enter. Me being naked was not a good enough reason. \ud83d\ude02", "I get what you mean. But your rationale is literally the same one I used to use to justify my bi panic as a teen. \n\nJust to clarify, I'm not implying anything about your sexuality. Your comment just took me back to the awkward highschool me and made me laugh.", "Yes that was my immediate reaction when you mentioned the towel- protecting from burns!", "No XD I am bi actually. But I've never thought of it that way actually. I've never been aroused by looking at almost full nude boobs online, but maybe that's just me", "It might not be the main point but culture plays a big role in how things are handled and what's \"normal\" and expected. It can absolutely have an impact when people are being influenced by culture. \n\nIt could also help understand the husband's motives if OP wanted advice on how to handle it. If they were in a place where nudity was extremely normal and he was acting this way then it might be indicative of something more than just discomfort, but because they're in America it's more likely to just be because of cultural norms about nudity.", "Regardless which side of the discussion you fall on, this can **in no way** be construed as an issue of bodyshaming women.", "Imagine being so narcissistic your offended that people don't want to see you naked.", "That's an explanation for why the husband might have acted the way he did.\n\nBut that doesn't really change whether or OP is being an asshole here.\n\nHis cultural norms are not really the topic at hand.", "Cultural norms *could* take this from NTA to NAH so I believe it absolutely could be relevant to the judgement. You seem to believe it isn't, and that's your choice, but you seem to be in the minority with that belief. That's fine as well, of course, but perhaps be mindful of that when claiming that it isn't.", "You do know what they say about assuming. It's wrong what the husband is doing but you can't judge someone for their reasoning when we don't know their reasoning.", "That's the inherent issue with the way this subreddit categorizes the responses.\n\nThe NAH response creates a built in false dichotomy implying that if OP is NTA then the other party must be an asshole by default.\n\nMaybe the husband is an asshole, maybe he isn't. But really, the question being asked is whether or not the OP is an asshole or not. The husbands asshole status is basically irrelevant.", "NAH is a valid and categorized response in this sub, so the husband's AH status is relevant based on that. If the husband was being a raging AH then that would warrant OP handling this in a certain way, if the husband was not acting like an AH and his response was reasonable then this would just be a difference of opinion which should be handled differently, thus having the possibility of changing the verdict (was the response justified and proportional? Was the any information that could explain either of the reactions? Etc) Any time there is an AITA where someone else is involved (basically all of them) the other parties actions are absolutely relevant. \n\nAs mentioned, this is my opinion, so I'm debating my position not arguing I'm right. Just want to be clear this is a friendly response", "So you're telling us that if a random man in a trench coat approached you and flashed you his dick, you'd start applauding and telling him he's \"SO BRAVE FOR HIS SEX POSITIVITY\"\n\nNo? You obviously hate men.", "Where exactly is this sexism? Being uncomfortable with nudity, male or female, doesn't automatically imply that the person hates a gender. While it's not ok to shame people, it's ok to be personally uncomfortable by nudity. \n\nI mean, I'm a feminist and all but I don't want anyone seeing my vag and I'd prefer not to see any one else's vag. I'm not grossed about by vag. I don't hate women. I'm sex positive. I just don't wanna see you naked and implying there is something wrong with someone \nnot wanting you naked is pretty narcissistic."]}
