My dad knew I wouldnt had been ordering again for 3 months or more. She said me and my dad were both selfish for not saving her any and for me not buying her an pizza.

She\u2019s an abusive lunatic. I don\u2019t want to hear one word about hormones, or trauma, or anxiety, or having a bad day. People this out of control have no business being in relationships.
