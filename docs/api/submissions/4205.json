Feel free to use your own even if you want, but don't drag someone else's even into your petty revenge game.\n\nYour SIL made a deal to get the wedding paid for. She had a choice. She could have paid for it herself. She agreed to the terms. Who cares if the cake tases good? No one really.", ">Everyone is dreading this cake, especially Meghan.\n\nBut is she dreading a scene at her wedding more? That is what you must weigh before you proceed. Personally, I was not thinking about the cake at all at my wedding, it's a minor part of the whole event. Unfortunately, there was a scene at my wedding, but everyone was kind enough and quick enough to keep it away from me and my husband during the reception (and I was very grateful for that when I heard later). Just food for thought, but if they would be upset or embarrassed by the second cake, don't do it. YWBTA if they were upset by a possible scene.", "ESH but I agree that it's an awesome idea.  A thought: Order the cake, have it kept out of sight and when everyone leaves the junker on the table, let your SIL know there is a backup nearby, should you bring it out?

This can still be prevented.\n\nIt's your SIL's wedding. Ask them, do what they want. Full stop.\n\nCausing a fuss on their wedding day is not the nice gesture you think it is. Most people don't really give a shit about wedding cake. If there is a shitty cake, a few people will be bummed, and then immediately forget.

I absolutely would have taken that deal from the world\u2019s worst basket because weddings are expensive. The woman could cause a scene and make more drama than the bride would like to deal with.

She could storm out and the bride ends up in tears for drama on her wedding day. \n\nHowever, there are ways to be NTA and still salvage dessert. Some suggestions below: \n\n1. If we are worried about style, ensure the bride has discussed with MIL the style of the cake she wants. She could also get a fake top tier and topper to place on top if she thinks she is going to mess up the tiers. \n\nOR She could also get a fake cake built for decoration and just have MIL do sheet cake to be cut out for guests. In Latin American weddings, this is normal. \n\n\n2. She could tell MIL I want a cake, and I want cupcakes from this bakery right here. Order cupcakes too. \n\n3. The country where I am at right now does a wedding cake AND dessert with dinner. She can order desserts from the caterers since it is important to give options for people. You can also say due to allergies or insert whatever reason here (groom\u2019s side of the family loves x) we are having more sweets/treats. \n\n-You can have a variety of cheesecakes, pie, squares, truffle, mousse and/or special dessert cookies. \n\n4. You can order her/she can get a chocolate fountain and fruit on the side OR even pre-ordered chocolate covered strawberries/fruit ALONG with a variety of desserts. \n\nAs a side note, my SIL had nearly all of the above : a wedding cake (three different kinds), a chocolate fountain with fruit AND desserts (cheesecake/pie) at her wedding reception. All went over well! \n\nGood luck Op! Please consult with the bride and go over suggestions. Don\u2019t give her any cause for embarrassment. Take your lead from her.  Plenty of options for good dessert food after dinner that side steps the cake.", "If you do this, get a sheet cake rather than a tiered cake.  They'll do the cake cutting and then take it to the back to cut and then bring it out.  \n\nSo just make sure you talk to the catering staff about your plan ahead of time so they know. You can have the cake delivered straight to the venue rather than bring it yourself.", "NTA Wish I could come.

Leaving the bride to be upset on the day as she doesn\u2019t have a cake. In which case having a back up cake would be a great relief to the bride. Maybe talk to the bride about a back up cake?", "NTA  Great plan, do it!", "NTA what you will do is a must knowing the circumstances!!

And the bride will have to decide which cake to cut., With all consequences. Maybe even with the weddning reception ending there and then - which WOULD be reasonable, because THE BRIDE would be breaking the agreement.", "And no matter how often she says she had no idea what OP was planning, Meghan is going to get 100% of the blame for this stunt.  No one is going to believe she didn't orchestrate it to humiliate Mary.", "Sweetie usually if the party is already happening then they have already paid. If they wait and make sure to distract step (can't make myself write m*m) and dad they can cut steps cake get them distracted and get pics cutting y'alls cake move it all out of site, staging area would be good,  and serve the good cake.", "And if I was OP I rather allow evil stepmother to take the credit instead of her getting upset and ruining my SIL wedding over a cake.  She doesn't sound like the type to sit there in silence after being embarrassed. \n\nI take her bragging over cake compared to her causing a scene.", "\"**Sweetie usually if the party is already happening then they have already paid. \"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd since they have paid, they can go to the caterer and tell him \"Thank you, remove everything, the party ends right now\".", "No one would do that no caterers will do that. It has been paid for the money would never be returned. Most caterers I've dealt with would laugh and keep doing their job. Day of, who paid doesn't matter to them anymore they then are there to serve the bride. Trust me I've worked with and dealt with several rentals, caterers, and event venues. Once the party starts it won't stop till it is scheduled to stop. And if dad would try to threaten to cancel checks they could sue because once paid and the event has started everyone has a no refund policy. Dad and step could be loud angry and fuss but they won't be able to stop a dang thing. So if you distract them you can potentially bypass them yelling which yes is the worst they can do if they don't find out till the wedding.\n\neta: a venue can shut it down early if dad gets out of hand to protect their venue. However, they may also have security on staff and just escort dad and step out of the party. Which sounds like the best outcome good cake and no itchs in the party."]}
