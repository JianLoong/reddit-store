Feel free to use your own even if you want, but don't drag someone else's even into your petty revenge game.\n\nYour SIL made a deal to get the wedding paid for. She had a choice. She could have paid for it herself. She agreed to the terms. Who cares if the cake tases good?

Personally, I was not thinking about the cake at all at my wedding, it's a minor part of the whole event. Unfortunately, there was a scene at my wedding, but everyone was kind enough and quick enough to keep it away from me and my husband during the reception (and I was very grateful for that when I heard later). Just food for thought, but if they would be upset or embarrassed by the second cake, don't do it. YWBTA if they were upset by a possible scene.", "ESH but I agree that it's an awesome idea.  A thought: Order the cake, have it kept out of sight and when everyone leaves the junker on the table, let your SIL know there is a backup nearby, should you bring it out?

This can still be prevented.\n\nIt's your SIL's wedding. Ask them, do what they want. Full stop.\n\nCausing a fuss on their wedding day is not the nice gesture you think it is. Most people don't really give a shit about wedding cake. If there is a shitty cake, a few people will be bummed, and then immediately forget.

I absolutely would have taken that deal from the world\u2019s worst basket because weddings are expensive. The woman could cause a scene and make more drama than the bride would like to deal with.

She could storm out and the bride ends up in tears for drama on her wedding day. \n\nHowever, there are ways to be NTA and still salvage dessert. Some suggestions below: \n\n1. If we are worried about style, ensure the bride has discussed with MIL the style of the cake she wants. She could also get a fake top tier and topper to place on top if she thinks she is going to mess up the tiers. \n\nOR She could also get a fake cake built for decoration and just have MIL do sheet cake to be cut out for guests. In Latin American weddings, this is normal. \n\n\n2. She could tell MIL I want a cake, and I want cupcakes from this bakery right here. Order cupcakes too. \n\n3. The country where I am at right now does a wedding cake AND dessert with dinner. She can order desserts from the caterers since it is important to give options for people. You can also say due to allergies or insert whatever reason here (groom\u2019s side of the family loves x) we are having more sweets/treats. \n\n-You can have a variety of cheesecakes, pie, squares, truffle, mousse and/or special dessert cookies. \n\n4. You can order her/she can get a chocolate fountain and fruit on the side OR even pre-ordered chocolate covered strawberries/fruit ALONG with a variety of desserts. \n\nAs a side note, my SIL had nearly all of the above : a wedding cake (three different kinds), a chocolate fountain with fruit AND desserts (cheesecake/pie) at her wedding reception. All went over well! \n\nGood luck Op! Please consult with the bride and go over suggestions. Don\u2019t give her any cause for embarrassment. Take your lead from her.  Plenty of options for good dessert food after dinner that side steps the cake.", "If you do this, get a sheet cake rather than a tiered cake.  They'll do the cake cutting and then take it to the back to cut and then bring it out.  \n\nSo just make sure you talk to the catering staff about your plan ahead of time so they know. You can have the cake delivered straight to the venue rather than bring it yourself.", "NTA Wish I could come.

Leaving the bride to be upset on the day as she doesn\u2019t have a cake. In which case having a back up cake would be a great relief to the bride.

It has been paid for the money would never be returned. Most caterers I've dealt with would laugh and keep doing their job. Day of, who paid doesn't matter to them anymore they then are there to serve the bride. Trust me I've worked with and dealt with several rentals, caterers, and event venues. Once the party starts it won't stop till it is scheduled to stop. And if dad would try to threaten to cancel checks they could sue because once paid and the event has started everyone has a no refund policy. Dad and step could be loud angry and fuss but they won't be able to stop a dang thing. So if you distract them you can potentially bypass them yelling which yes is the worst they can do if they don't find out till the wedding.\n\neta: a venue can shut it down early if dad gets out of hand to protect their venue. However, they may also have security on staff and just escort dad and step out of the party.

I *highly* doubt, even if you managed to distract them to bring out another cake, do another cutting, and serve it, that the couple wouldn't find out. And regardless of whether they say the bride and groom didn't know it'll most likely come back to bite them. It's their wedding, they should be the ones to decide what they want.

Prices are jacked higher than other parties, you pay for packages or provide your own in almost all situations. I have seen brides lie about it being a wedding because they didn't like the price tag that went with the wedding and the money due before, not after, or in installments. But I can promise you no food would be served by the caterer till the money was in hand. At one wedding I worked father of the bride got pissed because he wasn't appreciated enough for what he paid for. He tried exactly that pack it up this party is over, and the owner said sir I have all the money, and the day of is about the bride, not the wallet. With the many, I've worked with it seems to be a universal feeling, and have seen in contracts where it says the day of the bride is queen, basically. Weddings are no joke when it comes to making money, and what will hurt worse a review that states \"my dad was mad about not being appreciated that the caterers canceled my wedding for him\", or a dad trying to leave a review of \"I wasn't appreciated enough but he wouldn't shut down and cancel the wedding.\" I would bet money the first one would lose the company mountains of money the other might just have brides come more because they know no matter what the caterer/vender has their back.", "Yup then he could be sued by the caterer, still won't work out well for him. If dad signed anything while paying he is on the hook at this point. I've seen people have the payer sign too not just the couple, especially if the money never comes from the couple's account. Everyone now in days has many CYA things in place, not only those getting married but also the signer of checks because they don't want to gets screwed in a situation like this.", "I don't doubt that caterers don't want to cancel a wedding mid event. \n\nBut I do strongly disagree with counting on the bill being paid in full. That's not how it has gone for the three weddings I've thrown. Part was paid but the final bill wasn't paid until the event concluded. It may vary where you live but it certainly isn't the case where I live. \n\nSo OP does need to consider that she might jeopardize the full payment of the wedding by the dad.", "I get that I guess, most of the ones I was involved in had open bar packages and unless too many people showed up everything was paid before the bride hit the aisle. So I would look into that then first, how much of everything is fully paid for. Then if dad pitched a fit my snarky self would say you said she had to bake the cake you didn't say it had to be the only cake. But yeah just talking about my experience,  plus cake is usually after food is served so if dad who paid and maybe signed contracts won't be able to say anything, if he refuses to pay and his name is on anything he will be sued. And in court, I don't think my daughter verbally agreed my wife could bake a cake but someone else also ordered one so I don't think I should pay would work. For a couple reasons 1. Most place in US verbal agreements aren't worth the paper they aren't written on, 2. Food was served vender kept their end of the deal and 3. If dad signed anything it is the only contract that will matter.", "Example - the last family wedding we had was in May and it snowed. Additional heaters needed to be brought in, the venue charged for plowing and shoveling, the fee for two extra canopy tents, etc. \n\nI don't think a random guest will be able to in anyway confirm what has been paid for and what hasn't. They aren't financially responsible or anything other than a guest. Who would talk to them about someone else's event? \n\nEven is the bride had no legal responsibility, why would she want dad to pitch a fit at her wedding? Why would they want the wedding tainted by a potential lawsuit? And what if the bride or groom have their name on some of the contracts?", "And the wedding won't be tainted by whatever nonsense the step does. I can't believe the cake she is making will be amazing rather than a total crap fest. So either way, dad will ruin it with step's help. What if the only wedding cake is literal trash is that not gonna ruin everything? Have security remove him if he yells. But if I was forced into excepting a cake that is made by someone who hates me, I would want my loved ones to have a backup cake, even if I got yelled at. A Fed up cake is like a silent yell to me, everyone will see it, everyone will judge and I bet depending on how bad it is the bride will still cry. Honestly, the best solution might be to do an after party with the new cake, let the save it for the 1st year if that is what they want. And he'll go a step forward and make memory books of the wedding for the next Christmas, to give to everyone and where the cake cutting picture and pics of the cake should be the second one not whatever step brings.", "Maybe instead get a pretty \u201ctopper\u201d cake and give that to them separately away from stepmom.  That way they can serve stepmoms cake and still have a nice one for themselves\u2026to eat or save for their anniversary.  NTA on paper, but the repercussions could be unexpected.", "Ok, so I'm adding this separately from my other comments because it was an idea I touched on in a comment but might just be a fix. Plan an after-party, hell it can be a backyard bash nothing fancy other than the big wedding cake. And if she decides the relationship with her dad isn't worth it, she can make a memory book of the wedding with her second cake in it, not step's cake, and send it to dad for Christmas.
