You should be treated as an employee, not a serf.  What would happen to the drugstore if you got sick? And if your brother thinks it\u2019s unfair to your dad, he could help out!", "NTA... Everyone should have vacations, so you deserve yours. It suck on your father, but maybe he could have some vacations too if he asked someone to replace him.. Family business shouldn't mean slavery work for the family members", "NTA\n\nYour family is taking advantage of you.  It's time to put out your resume and start looking for a job where you wouldn't be working for family.", "NTA \n\nTaking time off reduces burn out and ultimately will improve productivity (if you want to look at it from a HR perspective). \n\nYou're not a machine and are allowed that time to relax and refresh.\n\nEnjoy your break!", "NTA. You never work for family. Your dad is an AH for exploiting you as a slave.", "Nope NtA and your brother has some nerve to bitch at you about needing some time off to deal with your mental exhaustion. Situation is different but he left the family business as well to pursue what he wanted. Why aren\u2019t you allowed to do the same??!!", "You\u2019re not the asshole. It\u2019s a tough situation. Either you all hire some help, or take no time off - ever.", "NTA. Of course you can take time off from a family business. Your brother is just wrong.

If it's a family business why didn't he replace you for your days off?\n\nGo figure.", "Everyone is entitled to a vacation. If you were an regular employee you would be getting allocated time. Maybe you should point that out to everyone.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWork somewhere else. THis is a problem of working with family.", "He used to take vacations when we had a couple more employees to help me there, now I guess he\u2019s just a bit stressed out", "Thanks for the outside opinion, but I personally don\u2019t think that they are taking advantage of me, mostly bc my dad don\u2019t even forced us, me and my brother, to assume the business when he retire, I\u2019m coursing biomedicine and my brother did engineering, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.", "Thanks, putting some needed hours on some rpgs haha", "Thanks for the comment, as I said to another person, in my house we don\u2019t mind at all having to work there, it\u2019s our place of guaranteed job, and the majority of the money that comes to our house, come from there. My dad really isn\u2019t that kind of a person, believe me lol, he\u2019s kinda a gentleman, is my brother that is kinda of an AH sometimes", "Good question bud", "Fucking nothing lol, he graduated from college and begun to be a engineer, all of his chores were there for me to do in his place", "Double standard checking out", "You had to act out to get a rightly deserved break. That's not normal...", "I understand, but workers have rights, one of which is vacation and time off. You even gave plenty of time to find a replacement. Employees who have no time off and are not allowed to leave are slaves. Don't let the \"family\" card be played as an excuse to exploit you.", "Plus you gave your dad 3 months to figure out someone to fill in for you! That\u2019s more than enough time. Just because it\u2019s the family business doesn\u2019t mean your obligated to run yourself ragged for it! Enjoy your days off and tell your judgmental brother to kick rocks!", "Got your point, thanks man, for real.", "Nah, I\u2019ll politely tell him to fuck off, he always annoyed me since childhood", "Basically the same thing lol. That my favorite e way to say it too. Enjoy your vacation and don\u2019t take his calls/texts.", "I\u2019ll do it, thanks", "You\u2019re welcome!", "NTA.  Everyone needs a break to recharge their mental batteries.  Also, OP should mention to the brother that indentured servitude is illegal.  \n\nHope OP has a good, relaxing vacation.", "NTA - you have to take care of yourself to do a job, any job and time off is essential for that.", "NTA. There's a saying that \"You don't own a business - the business owns you\". And it is absolutely true. I know - I'm in that boat. But it is also extremely important to take time to help with burnout.", "Nta. My family has a business my dad worked at and we still took vacations.", "NTA\n\nIt's a poorly run business that can't have someone take a vacation. Perhaps you should be gone during semester breaks and your brother can fill in - since he clearly doesn't need a break.\n\nEverybody needs a holiday.", "Thanks", "Take the time off without feeling any guilt. You need time to recharge, and it sounds like your father finally realized that when your attitude slipped into the negative when he did not arrange for someone to cover you.  Enjoy yourself!", "Look at it this way - if you're being paid a fair wage for the job you do, then someone who \\*isn't\\* part of the family should be willing to work the job for pretty much the same wage - right? If that's the case, then it'd make a lot of sense for the business to have at least 3-4 employees (maybe a couple of them are part-time) so that when somebody needs to take time off, other folks can be there to take up the slack. If the store is staffed correctly, then it shouldn't hurt the bottom line for someone to need to go on vacation, because other people can step in and work those hours for the same wage.\n\nBottom line, the business needs to have vacation time for employees built into its business plan, for \\*all\\* employees, whether they're family or not. Requiring everyone to be there all-year-round is unsustainable.", "Make sense, with that put on, I guess we\u2019re short staffed", "This is absurd.  On what planet does a business think they can't give you time off?  NTA", "NTA, but is the brother giving you a hard time about taking 2 days off the same brother who has taken 2 years off? Because if so that's some brass ones right there.", "NTA\nYour brother didn't just take 15 days.  He took *years* away from the family business.  Where does he think he gets to criticize?", "NTA. The dynamics of a family business can be tough to navigate, oftentimes leading to expectations that would not be required from a non-family employee. You are within your right to ask for vacation, and honestly if your brother is so worried about it he can work.", "Let just take an example. If you were not his son, he Would give the employee a vacation according to the request, or arranged a formally appointed vacation time. Not giving you a vacation without any warning when you have discussed it Is taking advantage. Especially as you take such a difficult course as biomedicine. As family he should be invested in your well being more compared to a random employee as well.", "Be honest, would you take this crap from anyone else?", "No", "NTA", "If they want to work themselves into an early grave, then let them, you don\u2019t have to do the same.", "Nta, you knew you needed a break and it was ignored. Your brother is a hypocrite. He gets to take time off for school and you're left covering for him. Nta", "That was my reaction too- brother wants to say OP can\u2019t take a vacation, meanwhile he completely abandoned the family business, hence OP having to take their brother\u2019s place. Yeah, he left to pursue his dreams, which is great. But he still isn\u2019t entitled to any opinion on OP\u2019s work life when he is not a part of that work.\n\nPeople always want to volunteer other people\u2019s money, time, and effort without putting in any work of their own. NTA.", "And do you think it would be acceptable for anyone else? Because I'm pretty sure in several countries this is against labor laws", "NTA you are being taken advantage of, time to look for a different job.", "NTA.   \n\n\nWork to live, don't live to work. If the business does so poorly that you people can't even afford to take a vacation, then it's time to re-evaluate how you do business rather than suffer from burn out."]}
