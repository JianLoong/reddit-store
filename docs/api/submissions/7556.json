You should be treated as an employee, not a serf.  What would happen to the drugstore if you got sick? And if your brother thinks it\u2019s unfair to your dad, he could help out!", "NTA... Everyone should have vacations, so you deserve yours. It suck on your father, but maybe he could have some vacations too if he asked someone to replace him.. Family business shouldn't mean slavery work for the family members", "NTA\n\nYour family is taking advantage of you.  It's time to put out your resume and start looking for a job where you wouldn't be working for family.", "NTA \n\nTaking time off reduces burn out and ultimately will improve productivity (if you want to look at it from a HR perspective). \n\nYou're not a machine and are allowed that time to relax and refresh.\n\nEnjoy your break!", "NTA. You never work for family. Your dad is an AH for exploiting you as a slave.", "Nope NtA and your brother has some nerve to bitch at you about needing some time off to deal with your mental exhaustion. Situation is different but he left the family business as well to pursue what he wanted. Why aren\u2019t you allowed to do the same??!!", "You\u2019re not the asshole. It\u2019s a tough situation. Either you all hire some help, or take no time off - ever.", "NTA. Of course you can take time off from a family business. Your brother is just wrong.
