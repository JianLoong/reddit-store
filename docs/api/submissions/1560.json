She used to  ride her dad's old Harley.  Ive always hated motorcycles and  thought  they were death traps. I would try to get her to sell it ,but she always ignored me. She died when she lost control on some ice coming home one day. Our son Joshua(19M) was about 13 when she died and it hit him hard especially since she used to take him riding with her all the time.\n\nI planned on selling the bike then not long after the funeral not wanting to see it anymore. When I went to look for it in the garage after getting a buyer set up  I find out the bikes gone and apparently Joshua and my BIL took the bike over to his place. I  got mad and asked why they took the bike knowing I was planning on selling it and they told me I had no right to sell a family heirloom and after some arguing I said fine and just said I didn't want to see it ever again. So there it remained over at my BIL's garage. That's what I thought anyways until Joshua turned 15 an apparently my BIl took him to go get his motorcycle license without telling me. \n\nI caught him riding it home one day and he told me. I was furious asking why he would want to ride the thing after what happened with his mom and he just kinda shut down. I  tried to bar him from riding and I took the keys from him ,but he'd constantly steal them back and go riding anyways. I just stop trying at that point amd he's been riding it ever since even after I got him a car.  He still lived with me while he's in school and just drives everywhere on that motorcycle even driving his boyfriend around on it.\n\nLast week they got into an accident on it, just some minor scraps and bruises thank god , but I was terrified and  I decided to try selling it again hoping he'd realize how dangerous it is. When a guy came to look at it Thursday  Joshua came home early and was pissed when he found out.  He screamed at the guy to f off and that the bike wasn't for sale. I tried reasoning with him telling him I didn't want to loose him like I lost his mom and that she literally died on that same bike. He yelled at me that he didn't care and  rode off.  I got a call from my BIL later telling me that Joshua had confided in him that riding was how he felt close to his mom an that I was being asshole trying to take that away from him and I should just let it go already.

The bike may be considered a family heirloom from your wife's family but that doesn't mean that it had to be passed down as soon as your son was old enough legally to ride. And as the bike was only passed one generation prior to that, IMO, the term heirloom was perhaps used a bit prematurely. Had your wife prior to death made it clear that her wish was to pass it down? Either way, its your son, therefore your decision, regardless whom he inherited it from and BIL had no right to overstep you. I would store the bike until your son is 18 at least\nEdit: I said not necessarily because despite your son's age, it would have been considerate of you to discuss this with him before just selling it as it has sentimental value to him. However, u get a free pass because of the pain and fear the bike represents to you", "NAH - I understand your feeling towards the bike and your son riding it, however you definitely cant sell a family heirloom especially when its not your family and I understand that your son feels close to his mum when he rides so i think its important he keeps riding", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To me, those would go with whatever bike/car the son has.", "Exactly. His son should be the one to make the choice of when he chooses to stop riding the motorcycle that belonged to his mom.", "Are you my wife? I'm not able to read your mind. God help the people you communicate with. \n\n\nThe first thing my instructor said was \"every time you get on the bike you accept the chance that you could die before you get home. The motorcycle will not protect you like a car does if something goes wrong.\" Pretty sobering, and would probably help his son NOT follow wife's idiotic choice to ride in icy weather. A huge part of that class is limiting the possibility of accidents through good choices (like not riding in shitty weather and being aware of your surroundings and all).\n\nSo you agree that by not titling it/insuring it it COULD put some pressure on son to take responsibility and ownership if he wants to ride?\n\n\nThe key to this working is for OP to have an adult conversation with his son, explaining his fears, listening to his son's wants, and coming to an agreement on how they can move forward. My suggestions (namely 2&3) were for that", "Well, sometimes one cannot avoid the shitty weather. I do ride a bicycle & while I avoid riding *to* anywhere in the rain or when it is highly probable, I have still had to ride *from* those places...\n\nThis is one of those no win situations for OP. Kid's gonna ride. OP's AH for thinking he could sell (then or now) something that was/is not his to sell. Any of the other is irrelevant to that. They could/should maybe have a conversation re the concerns etc... for whatever good it might do.\n\nMeh.", "YTA because it isn't your bike. At all. You are seriously committing a felony here so I'd rethink that real quick. We're you planning on forging the signatures on the titles? You are completely entitled to your feelings and they're completely understandable but your son feels differently about bike and he's old enough to make that decision. This is how he feels close to his mom. If you weren't aware of this before you are now so it's time to back off.", "I can understand your side of things but still a YTA. Simply because you have no ownership and cannot legally sell it. Let him have his inheritance or he will grow to resent you", "Unfortunately yes YTA. While I can absolutely understand your fear and not wanting you son to be riding it, it\u2019s not yours to sell nor is it your decision whether he rides or not. I mean you could try grounding him from riding until he\u2019s legally an adult, but that is only going to make the situation and relationship with your son worse. It\u2019s going to cause a whole lot of anger and resentment. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your wife and both you and you son\u2019s feelings are valid. I would suggest grief counseling if you aren\u2019t or haven\u2019t tried it.", "Yta, title should read I keep stealing my dead wives bike and trying to illegally sell it, while traumatizing her brother and her son!", "YTA. It's not your bike to sell. It belongs to bil and Joshua. I would have already called the cops on you for attempting this.", "Not your property  to sell. It sucks your wife passed away from it. It's in BIL and sons name, not yours. You cannot sell it. If you did, your son,  and BIL can and likely would press charges on you. YTA.", "ESH He has some audacity to call you up and try to guilt trip you about trying to keep your son safe, because he went behind your back when your son was a minor and got him that license. This man does not respect you and does not care about keeping your son safe, he wants that boy on a motorcycle and has been teaching your son to disrespect you.\n\nI think you're an asshole cuz you came on here representing that you have a right to sell that motorcycle, when it's not even yours. It is your son and your brother-in-law's. So you are trying to steal from your son and your brother-in-law, and have been creating a relationship with your son where your thoughts are more important than your son's. \n\nStop trying to sell the motorcycle cuz you have no right to do so. It is not your property, and you need to figure out what your negotiation is with your relationship with your son because it sounds like you're the one who needs to accept that your son is going to ride a motorcycle, you just need to decide if that's going to happen while he lives in your house", "YTA because it's not your bike. Your post is pretty dishonest to leave that out. I think the votes would overwhelmingly be YTA if everyone knew up front that the bike was willed to your son.", "nta junk it or sell it. your BIL is an asshole. should have called the cops and reported the theft.", "Yeah with the context of the bike not being his, absolutely an asshole for trying to sell it. I get not wanting it at the house, but that's the only line the poster has. They absolutely need to go to therapy because not only do they need to work through their trauma, they need to try and repair their relationship with the son before it's too late", "This. Like this other grown man going behind his back was so wrong, and it does feel incredibly cows for the sun to ride it around while still living in his father's home. It just feels like the brother-in-law was able to successfully create a side relationship with the son based on not respecting the poster, because the poster was acting like an asshole and made it easy to be cast in the part as an enemy. Like stealing a family heirloom does not make one look good", "Op doesn\u2019t own it! It belongs to son and BIL", "I don't even get how you think it would be okay to try and sell something that's not yours in any way", "Then it is ILLEGAL asf for YOU to try to sell it.\n\nEdit: also YTA. massively.", "Then stop trying to sell it. I get that you have trauma surrounding the bike but it's not yours to sell. All you're doing is pushing your son away by messing with the bike.", "that changes things. BIL still an asshole for undermining his parenting."]}
