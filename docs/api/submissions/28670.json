If you really, really didn\u2019t want to pay $45 for the ticket (which is what it sounds like), you should have taken possession of the ticket immediately and resold it yourself rather than put it to your friend to resell it for you after you\u2019d already backed out.", "YTA\n\nYou owe your friend for the ticket", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
