You were asked to help, and you did. Lily & Julia were both pleased. Grandma's opinion is irrelevant.", "NTA\nLilly is the girl's parent. She took your offer of help. She appreciated it. Julia was happy with her hair. No one else's opinion really matters here but those two and the dad.\n\nKatherine is overstepping as a grandparent.

My sib had to learn how to care for Black hair after adopting her girls and it's a learning curve, for sure. You did a very kind thing.

It doesn't sound like you knew about the feud beforehand. You did a good thing for your cousin's wife by showing her how to handle/style Julia's hair. It isn't your fault that her grandmother wants to straighten her hair. Straightening a person's hair is very damaging. Regardless of age. You did the right thing :)", "NTA. You weren't aware that this was a point of tension in the family. Besides, the child's mother was happy to have your help. More importantly, hair relaxers are toxic and a 5 year old is far too young to have caustic chemicals touching their sensitive scalps.
