I am so floored when I hear stories about people who don't realize their opinions are irrelevant. \n\nI'm not biracial, but my (white) boss adopted a biracial child.

I really hope the mother never tries to relax her hair. For those who don't have experience with it and may not know. I worked with those chemicals before while in school and they are nasty. Definitely not something a child should be exposed to. The mom just needs to learn how to do her child's hair. Curly hair is beautiful and I think it's really important to teach young children to love their hair. Relaxing destroys the curl pattern and the hair has to be cut off to fix it. The grandmother is the kind of person that will take that child and do it behind the mother's back. Curly hair isn't some terrible burden. It is beautiful and an important part of that child's heritage. You did nothing wrong here. Thank you for trying to help the mom learn in a loving non judgmental way.", "NTA. Grandmother is being racist. \n\nWhen my cousin was adopted by my very white aunt and uncle, they took a special Bootcamp class thing on how to do and care for his hair. Granted this was like 24 years ago but there might be something around like that in the area that might be of use to them", "Nta. How were you supposed to know about this feud? Julia needs to be able to have a say in HER hair, and putting chemicals like that on a child\u2019s head could be dangerous! Five years old is far to young to be doing serious damage without her consent or her understanding what the damage will do in the long run. And theres a chance Julia will resent her mom for putting her through that without her say so. Lilly really just needs help with learning a few basic styles for now that will protect julias hair, eventually both of them will be able to get the hang of it. They just need time.

That's the only thing that matters.", "Honey chemical relaxers are linked to cancer! NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Anyone who told me that they believe biracial people/kids look better with straight hair could kiss my whole ass. It\u2019s like saying \u201cGod clearly made a mistake when he was creating their hair, we should \u2018fix it\u2019\u201d. Racism seeps out of people even when they don\u2019t intend for it to, and this lady was clearly racist to her core if she believes anyone with  *naturally curly hair* would only look \u2018good\u2019 if they damage their curls to look \u201cwhiter\u201d, and she absolutely meant it as a \u201cshe doesn\u2019t look the way I wanted her to, but if I could just change her hair that would make it better\u201d. Disgusting. This lady shouldn\u2019t be allowed near the child at all if she doesn\u2019t like her the way she is.", "NTA. Even if you did know there was a feud, the mom still needs to know how to do her daughter's hair. \n\nI understand straighter hair is easier to manage, but curly hair is absolutely gorgeous.

And what you did was at a young enough age where she will not grow up hating her natural hair texture because it's not like everyone else's and because she doesn't know how to style it to its best advantage. If she later wants to relax her hair, it will be an option, not a necessity to be socially acceptable or to feel good about herself. The bickering doesn't involve you. Consider not engaging in it. You performed a kindness. It's a good thing.", "NTA. You did a kind thing for both mother and daughter. \n\nAs an old white, the old white woman\u2019s opinions and wants  are simply not relevant.", "NTA - Black is beautiful - and that goes for natural hair, too.

Point blank: period.", "And it's been proven to cause cancer. I'm a biracial black woman who's mom relaxed my hair for years and it fucked my scalp up permanently.

I'm going to follow up on that.  Thank you.", "NTA.\n\nLilly's mother is a racist, mean woman. She has absolutely no say in what Lilly decides to do with her daughters hair, and I am glad she listened to you, not her mother. Why would anyone caring for her want to condition such a young girl on appeasing a stupid and racist \"beauty standard\"?\n\nI hope Julia will be able to develop a loving relationship with her hair without the need to relax it (she can obviously if she wants to, but she shouldn't feel the need to do it to please other people or because she thinks her natural hair isn't beautiful). \n\nI think it was awesome and kind of you to help Lilly with all the knowledge you have from first hand experience.

You helped a mother who was struggling learn how to take care of her daughter's natural hair, which both she and the daughter are very happy about it.  Her mother on the other hand seems a bit racist, to the point that she is willing to potentially do irreversible damage to her young granddaughter's hair for the sake of making her look less black.  Lilly and Julia are happy, ignore the racist mom.", "NTA. We white women need to stay in our lane. Natural hair is beautiful and my understanding is the chemicals are very bad for kids. Grandma can pound sand, mom gets to make the parenting decisions and you did Lily and Julia a huge favor. Ignore the boomer.", "This has absolutely nothing to do with Katherine.

Like I've read many articles about girls with serious issue because they were under the impression they were ugly for having hair like that and we need to inspire and encourage black girls to embrace and love their natural hair after decades of being told it's ugly.", "I'm here questioning why the cousin didn't help sort it as well tbh", "Yes.
