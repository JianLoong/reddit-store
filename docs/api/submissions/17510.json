Not just hair damage but hair loss scalp damage. Not just damage but chemical burns can happen. Wooooooowwwww. You did nothing wrong. You helped a woman who was struggling and wanted to be to give her child healthy beautiful hair styles. Let them fight with themselves. They can either get on board or move and let that baby girl shine!!!", "Please don\u2019t let them relax her hair. My family relaxed mine when I was younger and now my identity feels lost.", "NTA. You helped the mom. It\u2019s great. She was happy. The little for was happy. That\u2019s what matters.", "I know I'm naive. I am so floored when I hear stories about people who don't realize their opinions are irrelevant. \n\nI'm not biracial, but my (white) boss adopted a biracial child. She was so grateful to have the insight from others who knew how to care for hair.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nTheir goal was to ruin her beautiful hair. Kudos to you for disrupting their plan and helping an overwhelmed mom.", "NTA \n\nEff that b\n\nShe sounds racist asl", "NTA, put these people in their place! Lily is the mother, they are not, they need to stay out of it and if Grandma has a issue take it up with Lily, not you. You did a nice thing for Lily and her daughter.", "I want to know how Julia reacted. Because that's the only opinion that matters. NTA.", "What a beautiful moment you had with your cousin and her daughter. Don\u2019t allow a crappy controlling lady to ruin something so special. NTA by a long shot", "NTA Ther is no way you could have known about the existing feud and you were helping a person who was receptive to it.", "Nta. I really hope the mother never tries to relax her hair. For those who don't have experience with it and may not know. I worked with those chemicals before while in school and they are nasty. Definitely not something a child should be exposed to. The mom just needs to learn how to do her child's hair. Curly hair is beautiful and I think it's really important to teach young children to love their hair. Relaxing destroys the curl pattern and the hair has to be cut off to fix it. The grandmother is the kind of person that will take that child and do it behind the mother's back. Curly hair isn't some terrible burden. It is beautiful and an important part of that child's heritage. You did nothing wrong here. Thank you for trying to help the mom learn in a loving non judgmental way.", "NTA. Grandmother is being racist. \n\nWhen my cousin was adopted by my very white aunt and uncle, they took a special Bootcamp class thing on how to do and care for his hair. Granted this was like 24 years ago but there might be something around like that in the area that might be of use to them", "Nta. How were you supposed to know about this feud? Julia needs to be able to have a say in HER hair, and putting chemicals like that on a child\u2019s head could be dangerous! Five years old is far to young to be doing serious damage without her consent or her understanding what the damage will do in the long run. And theres a chance Julia will resent her mom for putting her through that without her say so. Lilly really just needs help with learning a few basic styles for now that will protect julias hair, eventually both of them will be able to get the hang of it. They just need time. And lillys family can piss off.", "NTA. You did a kindness and made a young girl feel pretty.", "NTA. The mother came to you for help and was very grateful, as was her daughter. That's the only thing that matters.", "Honey chemical relaxers are linked to cancer! NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Anyone who told me that they believe biracial people/kids look better with straight hair could kiss my whole ass. It\u2019s like saying \u201cGod clearly made a mistake when he was creating their hair, we should \u2018fix it\u2019\u201d. Racism seeps out of people even when they don\u2019t intend for it to, and this lady was clearly racist to her core if she believes anyone with  *naturally curly hair* would only look \u2018good\u2019 if they damage their curls to look \u201cwhiter\u201d, and she absolutely meant it as a \u201cshe doesn\u2019t look the way I wanted her to, but if I could just change her hair that would make it better\u201d. Disgusting. This lady shouldn\u2019t be allowed near the child at all if she doesn\u2019t like her the way she is.", "NTA. Even if you did know there was a feud, the mom still needs to know how to do her daughter's hair. \n\nI understand straighter hair is easier to manage, but curly hair is absolutely gorgeous. My neice wants hers permanently straightened, and I cringe at the thought of it because her hair is beautiful.", "NTA. You did a great favor for Julia.  And what you did was at a young enough age where she will not grow up hating her natural hair texture because it's not like everyone else's and because she doesn't know how to style it to its best advantage. If she later wants to relax her hair, it will be an option, not a necessity to be socially acceptable or to feel good about herself. The bickering doesn't involve you. Consider not engaging in it. You performed a kindness. It's a good thing.", "NTA. You did a kind thing for both mother and daughter. \n\nAs an old white, the old white woman\u2019s opinions and wants  are simply not relevant.", "NTA - Black is beautiful - and that goes for natural hair, too.  It's a shame racist grandma had to get involved, but now you know her opinion doesn't matter. You did right by your cousin and his wife and daughter.", "I\u2019m a white woman with biracial nephews\n\nI\u2019m a color tech who does do hair straightening \n\nNever ever would I do hair straightening on a little child \nWho the duck would ?!?!? \nKatherine needs to keep\nIn her racist line \n\n\nJulie and Lilly have the best cousin in you", "Yup. Mom clearly doesn't want to ascribe to that mindset and you did a good thing in helping her on that journey", "This right here!! \n\nAs long as Lily & Julia are ok with what you did/say; that\u2019s all that matters. \n\nYou helped, not hindered. Point blank: period.", "And it's been proven to cause cancer. I'm a biracial black woman who's mom relaxed my hair for years and it fucked my scalp up permanently. Finding out that exposure to those chemicals can also cause cancer was the cherry on top of a \ud83d\udca9 sundae", "I had good results with treatments for a long stretch, but it only takes one bad experience to have your hair all break off at the root. Source: me and my tragic graduation photos.\n\nNow I let my hair do what it wants.", "Everything is a chemical. Even water.", "For sure!", "My mom is actually part of a class action lawsuit over the chemicals used in relaxers. They linked it to cancer and uterine fibroids according to the lawyers", "you know damm well theres a difference between the normal chemicals we interact with every day and harsher chemicals that can irritate the skin", "Blah blah blah", "Yeah it can be hard to determine what sources Google throws at you are reliable if you don't already have a solid knowledge base to work off of.", "Interesting about the fibroids. I'm going to follow up on that.  Thank you."]}
