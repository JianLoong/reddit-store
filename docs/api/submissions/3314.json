{"id": 3314, "submission_id": "z5im3a", "title": "AITA for crashing my roommates car, and then wanting to use her insurance instead of paying out of pocket?", "selftext": "I rear-ended my roommates car last week at a stop sign last week. It was a pretty minor accident (I was going about 10 miles an hour), and it was just a slight \\*bump\\*. Anyways, we got it checked out and there's $2000 worth of damages to fix her car, and $1000 for the guy I hit. I wanted to use my full-coverage insurance, but they wouldn't let me as I got into the crash with a car that was not mine.\n\nI proposed to my roommate that we use her full-coverage insurance (as that's what insurance is for and she pays about $400 a month for it), and I'll cover any/all premium costs of the insurance as well as the $500 co-pay requirement. My roommate doesn't agree to this deal. She proposed two things:\n\n1. We use her insurance, I pay the premium cost, the co-pay requirement, AND the value of how much her car went down in the market because using her insurance will show up in the \"car facts\" when she sells it.\n\nI asked her how will we know how much the car value depreciated, and she said when she sells the car next year, she'll ask the dealer how much her car value decreased due to the accident. I can't agree to this arrangement for a couple reasons. Firstly, I don't trust the dealer - wouldn't they just exaggerate the amount the car value went down to get the car for cheaper? And secondly, as I can't play any role in talking to the dealer or selling the car, I'm essentially signing a \"blank check\" to pay however much she/the dealer deems the car went down next year. This is too risky. What if she insists its like $5,000 next year? I'll have already agreed to pay the \"decreased car value\" for using her insurance. I also talked to my parents and they said that car values don't depreciate for getting into minor accidents like this one, just major ones, especially if the car is 100% fixed up. But there's nothing I can say to convince her that using her insurance won't lead to a substantial decrease in value of her car due to the accident being recorded in the car facts.\n\n2. The second option, if I don't agree to this deal, is to pay for everything out of pocket and not get her insurance involved. This would be like almost an entire month's salary for me. It's insanely expensive, and I don't want to pay-out-of-pocket when my roommate pays $400 a month for insurance. In my opinion, insurance is exactly for moments like this, and I'm really sorry that I can't use mine, but I'm willing to pay the premium on hers.\n\nHer argument is that I have the audacity to negotiate/argue with her when I crashed her car, and I should be apologetic and agree to handle things the way she wants to handle it.\n\nAnyways, AITA for refusing to either of her two options, and continually trying to negotiate for using her insurance without the \"car value decrease\" stipulations?", "created_utc": 1669498442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5im3a/aita_for_crashing_my_roommates_car_and_then/", "score": 2952, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YOU were the one to damage the car it\u2019s on you to fix it, this is a good lesson if you aren\u2019t responsible enough to borrow a car maybe get your own or use public transportation.", "Dude YTA. You used her car and got into a bingle. You pay for the lot and don't get her insurance involved. Don't use other people's shit, break it, and then haggle on the cost of it. Pretty straight forward.", "YTA and sorry but that will stay on her insurance record for more than just a year. You messed up, fix it.", "Reason # 938,049,383 as to why you should never let someone borrow your car. Your roommate is going to be screwed in this, due to no fault of her own. YTA for using HER insurance when you know it's going to negatively impact her. At least she knows never to let you use her vehicle again.", "YTA.  She didn\u2019t crash her car\u2026you did.  Why should she risk her premium increasing over your poor driving?  If your insurance doesn\u2019t cover you while driving other cars, get better insurance, pay out of pocket, or don\u2019t drive other people\u2019s cars.", "YTA\n\nYou used her car.  You follow her rules.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to pay the diffference in value. That is kind of crazy. But it\u2019s fair of her to not want to go through insurance. That will affect her premiums for years for something you did. You are at fault for the accident and you need to pay for the cost of repairs outright if that\u2019s what she wants. Her insurance may not even cover your damages as you probably aren\u2019t on her policy", "This is much simpler than you\u2019re making it seem OP. You broke it = you pay for it. That it happens to be a car, that the owner happens to have insurance is by the by. YTA.", "YTA.  You damaged her car.  You don\u2019t get to decide what is easiest and convenient for you.  If she doesnt want to go through insurance, you need to pay up.  Insurance rates go up after an accident.  It\u2019s one thing to pay up the increase when it\u2019s your own fault but she shouldn\u2019t have to deal with the increased insurance for doing you a favor and loaning her car to you.", "INFO:  How much is her deductible?  Yea she has full coverage but it kicks in after a certain dollar amount.  If the repairs are 1100 and the deductible is 1000 I would say YAH because her insurance will go up depending and she\u2019s out 1k.  \n\nHow much and how long the insurance goes up is based on the company and age of the driver.  400 a month tells me she is already at the high end and maybe she can\u2019t afford more.\n\nETA:  OP if you don\u2019t contribute to paying the insurance you get no say on when to use it.  You don\u2019t have a car for a reason so asking someone to deal long term is crappy.", "YTA\n\nYour roommate is right - the costs of your accident are:\n\n* Getting the car repaired (on her insurance)\n* Copay\n* The increase in her insurance premium\n* The loss of resale value\n\nYou could ask a dealer how much they would pay for a car like hers and then ask what if the car was recorded as having been in an accident.\n\nYour roommate is doing you a favour.  She doesn't have to let you claim on her insurance - she could just sue you instead.", "Info- you say you got a car three months ago... what happened to it that you were driving your roommates?", "Info: how is the person you hit getting their car repaired? (I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re going through your roommates insurance, if so there\u2019s already going to be a claim on it) \n\nAlso, her insurance rates can go up as high as 45% for up to 5 years. What I\u2019ve seen happen in this industry (I\u2019ve been working in it, but not as a claims rep or insurance agent, for 21 years) is that when insurance covers an accident and they know the fault is through another party, they\u2019ll sue that party (you) to get their money back. \n\nI\u2019d honestly say the best idea is to consult an attorney if that\u2019s financially feasible. Neither one of you really know what you\u2019re doing.", "NAH but it seems like you don\u2019t understand how the car insurance market works and that\u2019s a problem. Also this is why you don\u2019t drive other peoples cars. You should pay out of pocket", "Who said that the crash would only effect her premium for a year? In most places it's way longer than that--more like 3-5. For California, I believe the DMV keeps the at-fault accident on record for three years. \n\nHer asking to pay for the decreased car value is a bit much, that much I'll agree to. \n\nUltimately, paying out of pocket may end up being cheaper/simpler for you than paying her higher premium for the next three years. I'd work with her to do the math on that. \n\nYTA \n\nYou rear-ended a stationary car at a stop sign. That's not great. I can see why she's telling you that you have some audacity with her to argue/negotiate because that was100% an avoidable accident.", "If she pays her deductible their premiums will increase significantly, especially since you are not a listed driver on their policy and are responsible for the accident. Some policies may not cover the accident (depends on her policy, might not have enough coverage or isn\u2019t covered under policy). Find out if she lacks this additional coverage, or what her insurance limits are if she does have it - full coverage means nothing since it only implies having liability and collision/comprehensive coverage on a policy. If the accident has already been reported to her insurance company, it\u2019s already on the vehicle history report even if you pay for damages out of pocket - all you have to do is a VIN search, it shows all the repairs done to a car. Whether or not you pay for damages out of pocket or with insurance, the repairs will be listed in that vehicle\u2019s VIN report lol.\n\nHowever, asking to cover the depreciation is insane. All vehicles depreciate, regardless of your friend\u2019s opinion. Unless it\u2019s a salvage title, which means insurance totaled the vehicle, depreciation won\u2019t be as excessive as they claim. I hope your friend knows those Carfax reports also include routine maintenance w/ mileage and dates, and the way they value vehicles are primarily based on external factors, mileage, maintenance, etc. I used to work in the finance department at a dealership during college for a bit, and I\u2019ve seen a couple of trade ins rejected even with it repaired out of pocket if it\u2019s noted in its history (those Carfax reports are a general listing given to the buyer, the actual vehicle history lists the damage lol). Also, it\u2019s typically based on JD Powers and NOT Kelley Blue Book values (KBB has higher resale valuation, and dealerships and banks use JD Powers for trade in and to value vehicles for loans on used cars), and nothing more than 100k miles or older than 10 years, especially if you want a loan w/ that trade in, and if there\u2019s any noticeable blemishes/dents/scratches, and it\u2019s automatically rejected as a trade in if it has a salvage title. I can honestly tell you that a dealership will take a car that looks as close to perfect as possible, and will either lowball or reject a trade in that looks like trash or wasn\u2019t taken care of very much (this includes interior and engine too).", "INFO: You proposed to cover her $400/mo insurance for a year? Why would you want to pay $4,800+ in insurance premiums for your friend plus a $500 deductible to cover $3,000 worth of damages? You'd be paying a lot less just to pay the $3,000 in damages.", "I was going to reply to OP's comment about us laughing but it was removed, so I'll post here. I'm really sorry if I came off as rude or judgemental. It's not just you, either. *Most* people know nothing about the way insurance works and then they reeeeally really mad at the insurance companies for playing by the rules. I'm not making fun of you or laughing in a mean way, it's more so a laugh like to say \"oh man, if only it was that simple. The world would be a better place\". But I'd seriously recommend looking into insurance laws and understanding your policy and what you're covered against. It makes me really sad how many people don't know and end up getting shafted because they cut corners trying to save money, not knowing the level of risk they are accepting if something happens. \n\nThese rules are why so many people hate having to use their insurance, because small claims will cost them a pretty penny in the long run as opposed to paying out of pocket. With you being so young I'm sure this isn't \"small\" to you but you also have to keep in mind that your friend is probably saving anywhere from $50 to several HUNDREDS of dollars per month because of her claim free status and good driving history. Now factor in losing the savings for being claim free per month (we will just say it's $100 for the sake of simplicity) and multiply that by a minimum of 5 years (60 months) that's 6k more in increased premiums for the min length of time it will stay on her claims history, not factoring in some states are allowed to go back 7 years.\n\nIt's kind of similar to banks doing interest on loans, you can either pay the money yourself for whatever you're buying and save a few thousand *or* you can have the bank loan you the money and earn a few thousand in their pocket for a fee spread out over time. Same concept but with insurance payments. \n\nThis is why I don't let anyone borrow my vehicle or drive it ever, not even my boyfriend of 2 years that I live with. If I'm paying that much more on my policy, it's because of a mistake I made lol.", "If she\u2019s already paying $400/month for insurance the premium is certainly going to go up, and for more than a year. It will affect future claims and potentially get her canceled if she uses it again. YTA, you wrecked her car, she gets to decide how it plays out.", "YTA. You had the accident. You should absorb all the risk. You are lucky she's not including you pay the difference in insurance cost for the next few years until it goes off her record.\n\nPay and don't borrow anyone's car unless you can be responsible.", "As the owner wasn't driving, I would not be surprised if the insurance company didn't come after OP for the money for the repairs.\n\nSo OP would pay the deductible, the change in the premium, and still pay the cost of repairs.", "YTA you drove a car without checking if your insurance covers it. You damaged the car, you pay. \n\nShe is not obligated to pay for your uninsured ride. But you are obligated to pay. \n\nShe made two very reasonable proposals. The first one is more than fair. \n\nYou sound like you just want to get out of this without taking responsibility and as cheap as you can.", "NAH, but pick the cash option. Your roommate's (frankly stupid) way of calculating depreciation will leave you on the hook for possibly way more down the line, and her increase in premiums (because you rear-ended someone else, you're guaranteed to be found 100% at fault) will cost you both in the long run.", "NAH. I think both of you are pretty reasonable, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting the best information from those around you. This accident will effect the value of the car. All accidents do to some extent. I think the best thing you can do is get it evaluated now so that you know how much this has effected the value. Then you can work out an agreement between the two of you right now.", "If she loaned you her car, you were using it with permission, then in the US at least it is her insurance that will cover it.", "NTA\nShe lend you the car, she should be prepared for a scenario like this. If not, she should not have done it.\nThe scam of the depreciation was super low. Stop considering her your friend, because you are being looked at like a bank, not a person.", "ESH.  You should pay to repair the car out of pocket, but you aren\u2019t responsible for anything else.", "She chose to lend her car out. Poor choice. But here we are.

I have the same level of coverage and my insurance isn\u2019t nearly that high. \n\nI think it\u2019s awesome you are willing to pay however I think you need to respect the car owner as she is the one with the long term consequences.

The car is getting fixed.", "Depending on state, failure to report an accident can result in penalties and/or criminal issues.\n\nFor example, in California if you don't report the accident using SR-1 form within 10 days you can lose your license for up to a year. You must do this if the accident damage is over $1000. Thats a condition of your license (obv. this applies in CA, so check your own state laws)\n\nif you dont report the accident to the authorities and someone later claims money for injury (which often will happen) then California Vehicle Code Section 20002 applies and its $1000 fine and up to 6 months in prison.\n\nbut im sure a judge will be fine if you told them your roomie said to do it /s\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy all means, pay out of pocket . its honestly the better thing to do.

Simple as that.", "That will also raise her premiums, you paying that difference too?", "I think she\u2019s being a bit entitled with the extreme conditions.

While it's true your policy may cover your liability to drive someone else's car and you hurt someone else/damage their vehicle *buuuut* it may not actually cover the physical damage of the car you are borrowing if the owner of the car *could* file it on their policy. \n\nInsurance laws/contracts are a BITCH and have lots of little technicalities like that and a lot of the rules vary by state. If you ever have questions about what is/isn't covered ALWAYS call your company (preferably on the 1-800 number so the line is recorded) and ask, and take notes every time you call your insurance company about what you were told. If they mislead you about ANYTHING or give wrong information you have every right to hold them accountable so do it 100% of the time, get a lawyer if you have to. I say this as someone who is very intimately familiar with the industry myself.", "Yeah, I got roasted on not knowing how long premiums last.

All I know is that we already talked to her insurance, as well as mine, and that there's no issue in her insurance covering it. I think it's because she's paying a really expensive insurance... I'm not sure. but there's absolutely no issue in her insurance covering me", "California!", "Each state can be different. Oregon\u2019s is similar to what OP described.- Vehicles are covered not drivers.", "Yeah, unfortunately we already called my insurance, and they said they'd only cover the remainder of what my roommates insurance can't/doesn't cover. Insurances talked, and because my roommate has good insurance, her insurance was able to cover everything, so my insurance refused to pitch in. I can't do anything about it, I've begged and begged as I'd really like it to all be solved with my insurance and deal with the premiums myself instead of paying my roommate. We are in California, where state law is that vehicles, not drivers, are covered", "Which would NOT end well for OP.", "Yes, I also agreed to pay the insurance premium. The only thing I didn't agree to is paying the \"car depreciation\" value for the accident as I feel like that will be signing a blank check to pay whatever she deems next year", "Depends on the state whether she's entitled to this value change though. In California if the repairs are completed through an insurance company, they are assumed to be completed in a manner that returns the vehicle to pre-accident condition and therefore the owner is not entitled to diminished value.", "This would depend on the nature of the damage.", "[deleted]", "Oh hell yeah, especially since they are part of the same household they can be considered required to be added depending on the verbiage of the insurance contract. I didn't even think to mention that, but very good point.", "Depends heavily on where they live and how many years they have had a driver's license (not including a permit). Those are the two biggest factors of base insurance rates prior to any driving history surcharges. I've seen new drivers pay $400 a month easy depending on the state.\n\nThe only other thing I can think of that that can cause as big of a difference in premium, other than location or years licensed, is if they didn't have prior insurance (their parents didn't add them on to their policy as a teen because of the big rate increase so when they get a car in their late teens/early twenties they have no proof of prior insurance history. This fucking KILLS their chance of any half way decent insurance premium)", "The problem is that there is no objective way to figure out how much that is, and I don't feel comfortable signing a \"blank check\" just agreeing to whatever $ amount of money she deems she lost when she tries to sell the car in a year", "But she\u2019s getting her car fixed.  He should only be responsible for that cost.", "I have my own car, and think her car is an expensive fashion/designer car that I'm not into. Also, I already agreed to pay the premium on her insurance..

I'm not asking for sympathy, I understand its my fault. I'm a new driver (had only been driving for 2 months when this happened), not that it excuses anything, but it does hurt for random strangers online to berate me about how much the accident was my fault when I've already realized that its my fault and have sat in my own guilt about it. Trust me, you don't need to tell me I was stupid. I was stupid, I'm a new driver, I'm young, and this is my first year living alone in a big city. I'm sorry, I'm trying my best, and this accident has caused me a lot of financial and emotional stress since it's happened. I taught myself how to drive, I was never able to afford driving school, and my parents live abroad.", "She's moving to a different country in a year, so we'd only have to pay insurance premiums for a year (which I am more than happy to pay)", "There is a way to get an easy estimate, there are so many ways to get an online quote both now saying it\u2019s never been in an accident, and then again saying it has.

She can set any stipulations she wants to and OP should be bending over backwards to accommodate that considering everything is OPs fault in this situation", "You are EXACTLY right. Liability will follow you with most insurance carriers but I've NEVER heard of physical damage coverages doing so. Physical damage insurance follows the car, NOT the driver", "Well you don't need to worry about me. My car got totaled in May so I know my policy better than most people.", "So you're willing to pay probably 18k in premium payments for her over 3 years plus a 500 deductible...but won't pay 2k in damages out of pocket.", "It would be cheaper to pay for the costs out of pocket than the eventual increase in premiums for years to come.", "You are referring to comprehensive coverage\u2026and you should read the fine print of your policy.  Members of your household are usually considered \u201cexcluded\u201d unless named on your policy.", "Pretty sure drivers are covered under certain circumstances, just not this one because you're in the same household and I'm guessing you told your insurance you routinely use the vehicle not just 'used it this once'. Like, my sister can borrow my car and be covered under my insurance because we dont live together, but when I used my car to teach my nephew to drive I had to list him as a driver in my policy during that time.", "Well she also has all the risk.  Honestly I would figure out how to pay out of pocket.  You aren\u2019t insured and could be.

Again, you crashed their car, you are beholden to what they want you to do, full stop.", "If they file the claim, and for some reason they're able to keep op off of the policy, it'll probably be coded as permissive use at fault accident, and depending on the state, I've seen those cost even more than a regular at fault on a policy, however I can only speak about my own company's policies and contract. They may even decline to renew roommates policy because of it. I get so many angry callers because of shit exactly like this, I actually found the contract part that states this can happen so I can have people look at it to prove it's legal.", "Yeah, this is what happened to my roommate. (Her parents never added her on a prior insurance). She's also a new driver, under 21.", "There absolutely is an objective way to figure that out. Insurance adjusters calculate loss of value all the time for things like this. Some policies cover loss of value due to repaired damage. \n\nNow, I have no idea what that formula is, but it does exist and is not that uncommon.", "Then you need to pay the cost of damages. If she doesn\u2019t want to go through insurance that is the only solution", "Then why were you driving it? Drive your car. And this is the consequences of borrowing her car. Just pay for it all yourself, no insurance. How did you have an accident anyway? What's the story there?", "Them\u2019s the breaks. You were driving and caused the accident. You need to pay her for a year of depreciated value. Doesn\u2019t matter that the car is expensive and you\u2019re \u201cnot into it.\u201d \n\nA simple google search comes up with a whole page of depreciation calculators. Just try them all and see what the median cost is.", "In the end, it's often the same thing. It is often illegal to fail to report to the police, and once a police report is filed, both parties are typically provided information regarding the insured/uninsured status of the other driver. Assuming the person you hit is insured, they will be seeking either your or your friend's insurance company to pay for repairs rather than covering repairs themselves because their driver was not at fault. They have the right to do this with or without your cooperation, and can sue the responsible party's insurance to pay if necessary. Once the responsible party's insurance is notified, they will be contacting you to testify regardless of whether or not you notified them, and they will likely not be happy that you tried to keep them from finding out.\n\nI think that what you offered was fair (although accident claims can definitely stay on your record longer than a year, so you may want to find out how long it will actually stay on her record) and personally I wouldn't be comfortable with the \"blank check\" commitment to pay for the depreciation either. Can you come to an agreement about a maximum amount you'd be willing to pay? Maybe you can talk to a mechanic or look up kelly blue book valuations for comperable cars pre and post accident to make that call? Either way, I think both of you should motivate yourselves to resolve this before the other driver forces the issue and neither of you end up happy.", "The police.", "Is just teaching yourself how to drive a thing in the US?

These terms would just create an avenue with both the decreased car value and indefinite increase in premiums that would leave this open to abuse from both sides and further disputes. I doubt OP would be OK with a contract being drafted to protect both hers and her roommate's interest, but anything other than paying out of pocket should require it. \n\n\nAnd at this point, paying out of pocket is cheaper and better than this complicated drama.", "Yep, cheekmo is correct.", "I only used the vehicle this once, I don't routinely use it. I'm not sure why her insurance agreed to cover it, from what I understand, it is that she pays for full vehicle coverage (regardless of who's using it), and so the vehicle is covered instead of the driver.

There's so much misinformation about insurance rules and I have to be the one to deliver the bad news.

I was closer than I should have been because I was trying to \"sneak\" the left with him before the light turned red. All of a sudden he changed his mind about turning (not sure why, I think he saw a car coming and freaked out) and braked really hard, and I bumped into him.", "None of what he said or offered is fair.

Would you be paying it for the remainder of her coverage period which say worst case is a year if she just renewed?  So if it were a $200 increase per month your looking at paying $2400.

Them being roommates/friends is immaterial to anything. You assume risk and liability when letting another person use anything that belongs to you. Someone breaks your blender? Sure, you replace it. You wreck their car? You pay the deductible, and that is the end of your legal obligation and MATURE people understand this. All of this talk of her being in an insecure position and getting shafted, well with an already $400 a month premium, sounds like she has likely been playing bumper cars already. \n\nAlso where do you get him offering to pay the deductible and difference in premium as doing as little as possible? Would you like him to perform the repairs in his spare time? You\u2019re teetering on the edge of sounding unhinged.", "Well this is exactly why insurance is a massive scam, I'm not surprised people are mad when they call up.", "Based on my extensive viewing of Judge Judy when I had covid - the roommate would have to go through her insurance and OP would pay the excess.  Sadly since I am in the UK my degree on Daytime TV Law will never be used.", "JJ isn't functioning as a judge. She's functioning as an arbitrator - totally different rules.", "Exactly."]}
