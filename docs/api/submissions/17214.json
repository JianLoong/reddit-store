Her parents are not from America and family and meals are very important to them. I grew up in America and while we had Holiday dinners and maybe a Sunday dinner every couple of weeks. For the most part, mom or dad made something and then we ate it where and when we wanted. I eat dinner with my gf's parents every week and I love it. It is important to her and I have no problem with different cuisines. It's all delicious food.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I do not eat a lot. Growing up I was very overweight and saw a nutritionist. Stuck to a calorie deficit and worked on my portions and I've been at a healthy weight ever since. My relationship with food has changed and I no longer have the desire to tear through two double quarter pounders anymore. My gf's parents seem to get offended that I get small portions of things and don't fill my plate up a second time. They will make maybe 5-6 different food options and I'll get a little bit of everything because I want to taste it all. At some point every time I am there they ask me if I didn't like the food. They mention the small portions and how I never go back for more. I just honestly tell them that I don't overeat. They've never made a scene about it to me but I guess they've been discussing it with my gf while I am not there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple of days ago my gf told me that her parents feel offended over \"how little\" I eat. Which \"a little\" is a 100 percent full plate with a bit of everything made. And some days I eat less and or some days I eat more. It really depends. If I skipped breakfast, had a light lunch. I might fill up more for dinner. But if, for example. I got a decent breakfast, work catered sandwiches that day, I'm going to get a normal(small) sized dinner. My general goal is to have equal sized meals each time but with a busy work life that is not always possible. So some days I didn't have any food until family dinner and I am eating more than usual. My gf asked me if it were possible that I could eat a bit more just for them one day a week. She didn't push or demand, just asking if it were possible. I told her that I don't want to ruin my mended relationship with food. I don't understand why the parents are so offended. I always pack up tupperware and eat it throughout the week because it's delicious food. I don't want to disrespect her parents though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDT\n\nAnother odd thing I want to add. They will make comments about my girlfriend(who is in great shape) that she is \"putting on weight\" sometimes. But also pressure her to fill her plate twice. I don't get it", "created_utc": 1684076454, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13heggs/aita_not_eating_food_my_girlfriends_parents_made/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My extended family is this way culturally and it is considered offensive to them if you reject food/ don\u2019t gorge yourself but culture can\u2019t be prioritized over your boundaries and well-being. This is a good compatibility test for you and your gf. It will be uncomfortable for her but I hope she chooses to back you up.", "NTA. Your gf needs to talk to her parents about laying off of you regarding the portion sizes. Their attitude may be culturally appropriate for them, but is harmful to your health.", "INFO: Have you tried explaining to them the reason behind your calculated eating habits, as thoroughly as you are currently explaining it to us?", "NTA, eat what you're comfortable eating, don't overeat to appease someone else.\n\nDo your girlfriend's parents know about yout history and you relationship with food? If you're comfortable sharing that with them and explaining why you don't eat a lot it might help.\n\nCertainly there's no obligation to do that if you aren't comfortable, it's completely your decision, it just might get them off your back about it if they know why you keep portions small\n\nEdit: It doesn't even have to be specific, just something like \"yeah I've struggled with weight and nutrition in the past and so I intentionally keep my portions small. I promise I love to food I've just worked hard to become healtier and I need to eat smaller portions to keep it that way\"", "NTA- But they are for not respecting your autonomy. Disordered eating is already extremely difficult to overcome without people trying to pressure/relapse someone back into said disordered eating.\n\nNow, I understand in some cultures, that not 'eating enough' of a meal made for you can be seen as offensive, but that doesn't mean they can force that onto you and be upset with you for exercising your right to treat your body how you want. And I generally think that it's an archaic belief anyways, that encourages disordered eating and is objectively harmful to healthy food relationships, regardless of how they feel about it. People should be eating what they are safe and comfortable eating. Not more or less than that.", "NTA. \n\nYou weren\u2019t being disrespectful. My culture uses food as love and doesn\u2019t take well to not eating \u201ceverything on your plate\u201d but the reality is you have to do things for your own well being and they will need to adjust and accept your boundaries.", "Your edit is very relatable. My grandma would simultaneously say I should eat less to lose weight, and then say I eat too little when we're actually at the dinner table. \n\nIMO, you worked really hard to have your current relationship with food and it's not fair for anyone to force you to change your hard-earned habit just so you can fit into their cultural expectations of eating a certain way. There needs to be mutual understanding and respect, and I hope your gf's parents are open-minded enough to tolerate that. If they choose not to and your gf does not defend you, that's actually a red flag to me. NTA.", "NTA. But maybe a conversation can/should be had about that cultural difference and you can add in a \"for me, I have to *really* enjoy the food to want to take some home with me to enjoy again before the next family meal\" or something", "NAH. I think it just needs to be communicated with them that you do this with all food. You used to be overweight and don\u2019t want to be ever again.\n\nI know foreign parents can be from cultures where weight etc is talked about more freely. Discussing it with them and showing them an old photo of you might go a long way tbh. Just my 2 cents.", "NTA\n\nYou sound like you're doing exactly what you should. I'll never understand this drive to force feed people.", "Well explain this to them", "No explanation is necessary. Tell them the food is delicious and this is the amount you want. If they persist, repeat as necessary. \n\nYour gf can discuss it however she wants with them, but she should not be asking you to eat differently to please them. Tell her not to ask you again.", "NTA. This is obviously a generalization, but immigrant parents tend to have the weirdest neuroses about food and food consumption habits.", "NTA\n\nMy large extended family would always do that to me. Comment on weight and looks while simultaneously wanting you to eat more. I had to get them to stop doing that to me more so than my bf.\nI would encourage your partner to draw some boundaries for ya, or if you just let them know you love the food, and want to eat more, but aammmm jjuussst tooo fulllllll or w/e lolol. But tough situation to be in, but hopefully yall be able to help bridge that cultural divide!", "This and she has to do it now or this fight will last till the end of time. Furthermore think about how they are going to talk to your (if you choose to have any) children about food. The conflict will arise again.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA \n\nEverytime a not so close friend or family member comes to eat at my parents gets shocked we eat so little. We will have different dishes, entrees, soup and various deserts. But we eat small portions of each. I NEVER EVER got a second dose on my plate at home. My friends that are not so familiar with my portions get surprised I don't go for seconds, sometimes I do it out of respect and because they just stuff my plate again (and the food is delicous) but I wouldn't do it every weekend.\n\nShe needs to accept you have a different aproach to portions size and what you need to eat to feel satisfied.", "NTA\n\nBut have you spoken to other people you know from that culture to see how they deal with it? Is there ways to say no to more food that will be accepted? In my culture we usually offer people food/drinks three times before we feel comfortable that they are saying no because they don't want anything and aren't say no out of politeness and because they don't want to put you out. But there are ways to say no the first (maybe second) time, so you don't get offered again. It might be worth figuring out if your gf's culture has anything similar.", "Nta. I am also from a culture where everyone has to force feed everyone to show love. And will in the same breath comment about their weight gain.\n\nRespecting cultures and all is great, but this respect has to work both ways. You absolutely shouldn't eat more than you want to, and accepting that is on them. I honestly don't even think you have any need to explain your previous history with food, just knowing this is all you want to eat should be enough for another adult to back off.", "NTA. \n\nI say this as someone with Italian grandparents who are 100% like this with food. \n\nHOWEVER, they are also the most kind and supportive people to walk planet earth and would never make an unkind comment about anyone\u2019s weight or appearance. At times when someone in our family is purposely eating extra healthy, they will make plain chicken or something else for them. If someone just prefers to eat less, they\u2019ll pack some to make sure they have a home cooked meal everyday of the week. \n\nIt\u2019s totally possible to use food as love and communication and be respectful.", "Absolutely NTA. You're doing more than enough by taking Tupperware home. \n\nI have grandparents like this on my Mom's side. As they got older it only got worse. They do not listen to reason. My Mom has gotten so frustrated over the years she actually yells at them and starts fights over it.  It's not worth that, because they obviously have some kind of disorder around it, from my perspective.  I simply know what I'm getting into when I go over there. You have to just be like \"no no it's great! I can't eat that much.  Love it though!\" For...an eternity. Just gotta do the dance. It's possible the disorder/anxiety stems from growing up poor, through a war, and also being underemployed. So the food they were able to grow themselves or buy and prepare was like the ultimate and only way they could materially provide for people around them or show they were contributing to the success of the community and family. I dunno. It goes deep, I'm sure. \n\nYour gf needs some help holding her ground, no doubt it effects her more because she grew up with them and they are also commenting on her body size on top of it. Maybe a therapist can help her come up with some phrases to repeat or a way to tune them out. When they start being like \"we are offended he doesn't like our food\" she can just repeat the same two sentences over and over again. \"He does. This is how much he always eats.  Anyway, how's the weather?\"", "I'm Latina/Hispanic and man I felt this one (especially the last edit you made about them complaining about her weight then getting mad/pressure her to eat more/not eating enough) Like do they not know how food works ?!?   \nAnyways, good on you for keeping to your diet and goals!   \nNTA", "Fill a second plate and eat just some of the food and leave the rest. This way you show them that it was delicious and you helped yourself to a second plate but are full now.\nI handed it this way on business trips to the Middle East and whenever visiting friends from eastern cultures. Food is their love language and way of showing hospitality.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is an asshole here.\n\nMy family is like this, actually tons of cultures have something like this going on. If one of my friends or a boyfriend or something \u201cisn\u2019t eating enough\u201d I make a point to tell my fam that they \u201crave about the food all the time\u201d when they aren\u2019t in the room (even if they don\u2019t) and that Americans just eat differently. Depending on your gfs culture or her personal relationship with her family this might be hard for her, but she should try anyway. Make sure you compliment the food (it sounds like you already do) and just be friendly with everyone and eventually they should get over it. Different cultures have different ways of relating with food and it\u2019s normal for it to require some navigation. \n\nI\u2019d make a point to talk about how good the food is and ask your gf to back you up a little. I\u2019d be patient with her family. Family is always weird, and patience is pretty necessary regardless of who you\u2019re in laws or girlfriends parents end up being.", "NTA.", "NTA - You have to do what's right for you.  Keep in mind, to many people, food is a 'gift of who they are'.   My parents lived through the Great Depression in the US and to their dying day thought you clean your plate and don't waste anything.   It could be something along that line.   I've known a couple of people who felt feeding your guests well was a way you showed hospitality and a failure on their part if you aren't well cared for in their home.     I don't know how these parents think, but not everyone feels portion control is something that is important.  Thinking has changed greatly about food.", "Cultural/ personal understanding has to work both ways. They have customs and such that you should understand, but they also need to understand where you come from. In the meantime, perhaps a happy medium if for you and your GF make doggy bags while playing up how wonderful everything is. \n\nNTA.", "Born and raised in Italy so I get this completely. I also know from experience that no amount of explaining and reasoning will work and they\u2019ll probably keep pushing, especially if you\u2019re thin now.

NTA", "Definitely NTA", "NTA\n\nYou have found a method of eating, and painting your weight.  Lots of people are envious.\n\nThere are plenty of cultures where people are encourage to eat large portions at a family gathering.  That works if these gatherings aren't often.  Doing this weekly can take a toll.\n\nCan you tell the GF, and her parents that you enjoy it all, but you can't eat the large portions they encourage as you want to maintain your weight.\n\nOften parents do have a the double standard of eat everything, but don't dare put on any weight.", "Carry around one of those plastic plates that have the portion dividers.", "N T A\nMy family is Italian and my mother will walk around with her carb loaded, cheese engorged, lasagna screaming Mangia! to my friends and family.

She always comments on my weight even before I lost 75 lbs that I wasn\u2019t eating enough the despite the scale and my bmi \ud83d\ude02. GF is going to have to sit down draw boundaries for herself and stick up for you and your diet/culture but also your lifestyle and maintain that it is not a slight against them.

Sounds like they wouldn\u2019t understand or care because of the cultural difference, but at least you have explained it. Should you *have to* explain it? No, but this is your gf\u2019s parents.
