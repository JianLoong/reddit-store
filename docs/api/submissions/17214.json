Her parents are not from America and family and meals are very important to them. I grew up in America and while we had Holiday dinners and maybe a Sunday dinner every couple of weeks. For the most part, mom or dad made something and then we ate it where and when we wanted. I eat dinner with my gf's parents every week and I love it. It is important to her and I have no problem with different cuisines. It's all delicious food.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I do not eat a lot. Growing up I was very overweight and saw a nutritionist. Stuck to a calorie deficit and worked on my portions and I've been at a healthy weight ever since. My relationship with food has changed and I no longer have the desire to tear through two double quarter pounders anymore. My gf's parents seem to get offended that I get small portions of things and don't fill my plate up a second time. They will make maybe 5-6 different food options and I'll get a little bit of everything because I want to taste it all. At some point every time I am there they ask me if I didn't like the food. They mention the small portions and how I never go back for more. I just honestly tell them that I don't overeat. They've never made a scene about it to me but I guess they've been discussing it with my gf while I am not there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple of days ago my gf told me that her parents feel offended over \"how little\" I eat. Which \"a little\" is a 100 percent full plate with a bit of everything made. And some days I eat less and or some days I eat more. It really depends. If I skipped breakfast, had a light lunch. I might fill up more for dinner. But if, for example. I got a decent breakfast, work catered sandwiches that day, I'm going to get a normal(small) sized dinner. My general goal is to have equal sized meals each time but with a busy work life that is not always possible. So some days I didn't have any food until family dinner and I am eating more than usual. My gf asked me if it were possible that I could eat a bit more just for them one day a week. She didn't push or demand, just asking if it were possible. I told her that I don't want to ruin my mended relationship with food. I don't understand why the parents are so offended. I always pack up tupperware and eat it throughout the week because it's delicious food. I don't want to disrespect her parents though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDT\n\nAnother odd thing I want to add. They will make comments about my girlfriend(who is in great shape) that she is \"putting on weight\" sometimes. But also pressure her to fill her plate twice. I don't get it\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDT\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know you mean well. But the idea of pretending to eat. Or getting a small plate and going back to get another small plate is just so silly to me. I get that all cultures are different. I eat all the different food they serve and follow the religious codes when I am in their house. But the idea of taking someone's autonomy and having to fake like I am getting more seconds is just so ridiculous to me. Also didn't know so many people would relate to being force fed and then scolded for being overweight. As a midwest American. I've never experienced this. It sounds very toxic that so many people can relate to that and the mental issues I had as a severely obese kid/teen. If my parents behaved in that way it would have fucked my relationship with food up even more. But I guess nothing says showing love to someone like fattening them up and then scolding them for the natural weight gain you caused", "created_utc": 1684076454, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13heggs/aita_not_eating_food_my_girlfriends_parents_made/", "score": 731, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a good compatibility test for you and your gf. It will be uncomfortable for her but I hope she chooses to back you up.", "NTA. Your gf needs to talk to her parents about laying off of you regarding the portion sizes. Their attitude may be culturally appropriate for them, but is harmful to your health.", "INFO: Have you tried explaining to them the reason behind your calculated eating habits, as thoroughly as you are currently explaining it to us?", "NTA, eat what you're comfortable eating, don't overeat to appease someone else.\n\nDo your girlfriend's parents know about yout history and you relationship with food? If you're comfortable sharing that with them and explaining why you don't eat a lot it might help.\n\nCertainly there's no obligation to do that if you aren't comfortable, it's completely your decision, it just might get them off your back about it if they know why you keep portions small\n\nEdit: It doesn't even have to be specific, just something like \"yeah I've struggled with weight and nutrition in the past and so I intentionally keep my portions small. I promise I love to food I've just worked hard to become healtier and I need to eat smaller portions to keep it that way\"", "NTA- But they are for not respecting your autonomy. Disordered eating is already extremely difficult to overcome without people trying to pressure/relapse someone back into said disordered eating.\n\nNow, I understand in some cultures, that not 'eating enough' of a meal made for you can be seen as offensive, but that doesn't mean they can force that onto you and be upset with you for exercising your right to treat your body how you want. And I generally think that it's an archaic belief anyways, that encourages disordered eating and is objectively harmful to healthy food relationships, regardless of how they feel about it. People should be eating what they are safe and comfortable eating. Not more or less than that.", "NTA. \n\nYou weren\u2019t being disrespectful. My culture uses food as love and doesn\u2019t take well to not eating \u201ceverything on your plate\u201d but the reality is you have to do things for your own well being and they will need to adjust and accept your boundaries.", "Your edit is very relatable. My grandma would simultaneously say I should eat less to lose weight, and then say I eat too little when we're actually at the dinner table. \n\nIMO, you worked really hard to have your current relationship with food and it's not fair for anyone to force you to change your hard-earned habit just so you can fit into their cultural expectations of eating a certain way. There needs to be mutual understanding and respect, and I hope your gf's parents are open-minded enough to tolerate that. If they choose not to and your gf does not defend you, that's actually a red flag to me. NTA.", "NTA.

My friends that are not so familiar with my portions get surprised I don't go for seconds, sometimes I do it out of respect and because they just stuff my plate again (and the food is delicous) but I wouldn't do it every weekend.\n\nShe needs to accept you have a different aproach to portions size and what you need to eat to feel satisfied.", "NTA\n\nBut have you spoken to other people you know from that culture to see how they deal with it? Is there ways to say no to more food that will be accepted? In my culture we usually offer people food/drinks three times before we feel comfortable that they are saying no because they don't want anything and aren't say no out of politeness and because they don't want to put you out. But there are ways to say no the first (maybe second) time, so you don't get offered again. It might be worth figuring out if your gf's culture has anything similar.", "Nta. I am also from a culture where everyone has to force feed everyone to show love. And will in the same breath comment about their weight gain.\n\nRespecting cultures and all is great, but this respect has to work both ways. You absolutely shouldn't eat more than you want to, and accepting that is on them. I honestly don't even think you have any need to explain your previous history with food, just knowing this is all you want to eat should be enough for another adult to back off.", "NTA. \n\nI say this as someone with Italian grandparents who are 100% like this with food. \n\nHOWEVER, they are also the most kind and supportive people to walk planet earth and would never make an unkind comment about anyone\u2019s weight or appearance. At times when someone in our family is purposely eating extra healthy, they will make plain chicken or something else for them. If someone just prefers to eat less, they\u2019ll pack some to make sure they have a home cooked meal everyday of the week. \n\nIt\u2019s totally possible to use food as love and communication and be respectful.", "Absolutely NTA. You're doing more than enough by taking Tupperware home. \n\nI have grandparents like this on my Mom's side. As they got older it only got worse. They do not listen to reason. My Mom has gotten so frustrated over the years she actually yells at them and starts fights over it.  It's not worth that, because they obviously have some kind of disorder around it, from my perspective.  I simply know what I'm getting into when I go over there. You have to just be like \"no no it's great! I can't eat that much.  Love it though!\" For...an eternity. Just gotta do the dance. It's possible the disorder/anxiety stems from growing up poor, through a war, and also being underemployed. So the food they were able to grow themselves or buy and prepare was like the ultimate and only way they could materially provide for people around them or show they were contributing to the success of the community and family. I dunno. It goes deep, I'm sure. \n\nYour gf needs some help holding her ground, no doubt it effects her more because she grew up with them and they are also commenting on her body size on top of it. Maybe a therapist can help her come up with some phrases to repeat or a way to tune them out.

Anyway, how's the weather?\"", "I'm Latina/Hispanic and man I felt this one (especially the last edit you made about them complaining about her weight then getting mad/pressure her to eat more/not eating enough) Like do they not know how food works ?!?   \nAnyways, good on you for keeping to your diet and goals!   \nNTA", "Fill a second plate and eat just some of the food and leave the rest.

Depending on your gfs culture or her personal relationship with her family this might be hard for her, but she should try anyway. Make sure you compliment the food (it sounds like you already do) and just be friendly with everyone and eventually they should get over it. Different cultures have different ways of relating with food and it\u2019s normal for it to require some navigation. \n\nI\u2019d make a point to talk about how good the food is and ask your gf to back you up a little.

Keep in mind, to many people, food is a 'gift of who they are'.   My parents lived through the Great Depression in the US and to their dying day thought you clean your plate and don't waste anything.   It could be something along that line.   I've known a couple of people who felt feeding your guests well was a way you showed hospitality and a failure on their part if you aren't well cared for in their home.

Forget AH or not, in many of those cultures, food is one of the ways to show love. In many non-western cultures, it is nonsensical but the way to show love is to force feed those you love and then complain when they gain weight. Everyone sort of just agrees to it and everyone sort of hates it. They need to respect your boundaries and your culture, but it would be helpful in your relationship to try and be compassionate to their culture. I imagine many cultures get like this because many of these people lived in poverty and so feeding someone is the ultimate expression of love. Talk to your girlfriend about your feelings and be open to hearing hers - and set aside time so you can get deep without worrying about other tasks/responsibilities.\n\nAlso, in my experience with these types of things, if I politely explain my reasons and my boundaries, and assure folks (in this case, the parents) that I appreciate what they do and really acknowledge their generosity, they usually back off. They (the parents) are probably feeling insecure as well.\n\nAnd if at the end of the day they\u2019re still like that, then talk to your girlfriend again and go from there.

Two helpings wasn't even enough. Then, while she's pressing thirds and fourths she'll tell you you're putting on weight and should watch what you eat.

Despite trying to convince the host/hostess ( Aunty or Uncle ) that the food was genuinely great but i was stuffed, they would look down and say \" Then its not good \" and kinda patter about the kitchen looking flustered. THEN on the flip side, similar to your GF they are not afraid to take a jab about ones weight, even going as far as to grabbing the flabby part of the gut, which i always found evasive and ashamed and never got used to it.   \nYou are very lucky to heave a healthy relationship with food and stand your ground. Its not worth making yourself sick just to make someone else happy.", "NTA. Set your boundaries and stick to them", "NTA. I think your girlfriend needs to back you up here and explain to your parents that you appreciate them very much but you need to eat the right portion for you. It might help if you make a big show about talking about how good everything is and how full you are after you eat dinner, kind of like \u201cOh I wish I could fit another bite in but I\u2019m sooo full! This was amazing!\u201d", "In cultures where food means so much more than calories, there's usually a whole bunch of etiquette around it so you can indicate things like 'that was delicious, I'm so full so I'm stopping now, but can you put some more of it in a box to go'.

Maybe your girlfriend knows the way of it?", "NTA \nMy Russian mum and her friends are all feeders, and are all equally disdainful toward overweight people.\n\nMy mum used to tell me how much skinnier she was than me (she grew up in Soviet times and nearly starved to death) lol.\nIt\u2019s really insulting to me when people try to tell me to eat more than the portion I choose.

That could be the future if OP has children and OPs wife doesn't stop her parents.\n\nEta I didn't finish my thought but I think that lack of food in my grandmothers childhood gave her a screwed relationship with food and that she as one of my main caregivers tried to show her love by giving me to much. But then she also believe in dieting since it's a deadly sin for women not to be underweight.", "You're very literal, aren't you. That was only meant to be an example. A sample in a vast range of possible responses, of which people from your girlfriend's culture will be able to supply more correct ones. Heck, why not just have a talk to her parents about it.

Tell them you have a small stomach repeatedly, make it funny if you must.", "If you HAVE to eat small to maintain a good weight, you have a low metabolism, you need to ask your GF to tell her parents that.

Mate you're an inspiration to me. I'm currently trying to learn about preparing and eating correct portion sizes after 30 years of significantly overeating. It's a real challenge to overcome years of bad food habits (not to mention the social norms and pressures). \n\nNo one should be asking you to eat more than your comfortable eating, I don't care what their rationale is.

Still do your little bit of everything, but do slightly less.  Then you can go up for symbolic seconds.", "Nta. Have you explained to the parents the weight issues you have overcome?", "NTA.  If you're inclined to make them feel better, I would take a little less for a first helping and go back for a small second helping. Unless that would screw up your food relationship.

Either one of these might help.", "Nta \n\nBut could you portion a little less than you'd eat and get tablespoon size seconds?", "NTA\n\nInstead of saying you don't over eat tell them you eat the way your health care providers taught you to. Just keep putting it back on being consistent with the guidance of your providers. The comment about over eating might sound like a value judgement to them. \n\nI too am American and I have known many families like hers that at America back many generations.

Give them many compliments on the food while you are eating it.  Tell them that you can only eat a little due to your health plan.

Getting your weight in check can be a struggle, and overeating is obviously the best way to ruin that effort.\n\nHave you tried showing interest in the food?

You gotta eat as much as they want? So what? You gotta eat to satisfy the fucked ego of some prick instead of not starvin' ?  What in the fuck is wrong with them folks? You should not let yourself be forced to eat as much as someone tells ya. You should be eatin' ammounts ye be feelin' comfortable with.

It promotes food waste. At least it is just a little.

If anyone is being disrespected here it's op.", "Ah yes, nothing says showing love like force feeding someone 3 helpings of a food then scolding them for the weight gain you caused. I had enough mental issues when I was a overweight kid/teen. If my parents were like that I would have an even worse relationship with food and my weight", "I can see where you're coming from and it is abusive, but in most cultures where food is of importance and, more importantly, ethnic cultures besides the normalized western culture, comments like these are not intentionally mean. Most do not make comments like this to bully or make others feel bad, they do it out of habit and what that culture deems important (ie: skinny = pretty or whatever). If you don't have an influence of ethnic culture in your life, you wouldn't understand it...but it is abusive just without the intent to be abusive.", "Not small, literally a normal amount. I said small in comparison to what they expect. I eat dinner at their house and fill my plate up with everything.

It sounds like you're completely filling your plate in one go. This is the strategic mistake you're making.

My family were poor but eating everything on your plate and getting seconds was considered good because \"we're in a better place than their home country\". Then when I got \"fat\" there would be comments from aunts and uncles saying so. It's fucked.", "NTA. This is a cultural difference. In some cultures, you're considered still hungry if you clear your plate while in others, it's considered rude not to clear your plate because \"there are starving people in the world\".\n\nYour girlfriend is going to have to explain to them that you're not a big eater. It has nothing to do with them and if it did, you wouldn't be eating their food in the first place. Just like you learned to be respectful of their culture, they need to learn to be of yours. It will be difficult and there will be a lot of pushback, especially if the parents are saying their healthy, fit daughter needs to add more fat to her body.", "Is your gf a filipina? Becasue damn, that's me growing up. NTA. If your gf ever presents any food relationship problems, therapy kinda helped me. Haha", "You are NTA  your gf however is. It is up to her to explain to HER  parents that you eat a HEALTHY amount for you. Also you LOVE the food they prepare which is why you take some in tupperware.
