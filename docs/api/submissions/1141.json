This day we were both working from home. I was working from my room, and he sets up in the kitchen (computer on the kitchen island). \n\nMy lunch break hits and I, coming off 16 hours of no food due to fasting, am starving. My brother is in the kitchen doing a zoom call from his phone. I let him know it might get noisy for a couple minutes while I blend a drink. He asks if I could wait until his meeting is over, because he was here first and already set up. I ask if he could maybe go to his room (10 steps) for 2 minutes while I blend a drink. He says no, and starts to stop me from using the blender. He keeps yelling at me and trying to get me to stop and eventually puts his hands on me. At that point I start cussing him out. Then he demands I apologize after for cussing him out. \n\nBefore this, when I would study in the office area, he would be cooking. While cooking, he\u2019s also watching podcasts, listening to music, or other noisy things. He tells me to wear headphones, to which I complied no problem. Now that the situation is reversed though, I don\u2019t get a compromise.

He was there first, your responsibility to be accomodating, not his.\n\nYTA\n\nBut also INFO: Why are you so hellbent on 'proving' you are right, rather than just making the situation better by stopping being an asshole?", "Coul you just explain to me how it is that he didn't want to deal with a blender for thirty seconds but he's fine with yelling and physical altercations on a zoom call instead? The man doesn't make any sense.\n\nNTA but seriously, haven't you already been told why you're in the right? Is it not obvious after posting once? Reasonings have been given, commentary made. Can you not see which side makes more sense given the opinions you already got? Why, because your parents disagreed? If you take their judgement over ours what's the point of posting the same story again", "I\u2019m torn between YTA and ESH. \n\nCould you brother have moved? Maybe, but what was he doing in his meeting? Is his screen on at all times? If he\u2019s an active participant, moving around isn\u2019t ideal, phone or computer.  \n\nCould you have waited until he was done? Sure, he asked you not to use a noisy blender; that makes sense when one is on a zoom call. Opt for a snack or something else until he was done next time. \n\nBoth of you also need to open the lines of communication with each other. Talk about what your schedules are like during the day so both of you can plan meals accordingly.", "NTA.  He's on his phone, it's portable.  You don't work in common areas that might be needed by others.", "ESH- tbh you both are TA. You could have waited 2 minutes or taken the blender somewhere else. He also could have worked somewhere else like who works in the kitchen and has his zoom meeting on the phone? (does he not have his own  room to work?)", "Yta. He was there first, there's a big difference between studying and a zoom call and you proceeded to have an argument with him while he was in the middle of a call. Rude.", "NTA. You gave him advance notice and it was much easier for him to just bring his phone into another room than you moving the blender. He's the one who escalated it into physical altercation. Your parents are being really weird about this--saying \"this is how people get hurt\" just sounds like victim blaming.", "A blender is not music. It\u2019s loud and disruptive. ESH. You did this to try and get back at him. Yes he should have moved. Yes he should have in the past been more quiet.", "ESH. \n\nFrankly, shared spaces should not be used for WFH. They\u2019re shared, not personal. Both people should have equal access. By his working in there, you\u2019re restricted. But making a smoothie while he\u2019s in there is not cool. You all need to agree that shared spaces are off limits for WFH, and noises should be kept to a minimum during standard works hours.", "YTA\n\n- You could have waited.   \n- You could have eaten something else   \n- You could have carried the blender those few steps away and closed a door.   \n\nHe was already in the meeting. You were the one interrupting.", "You could have taken the blender in another room. He was on a Zoom meeting for work. \nLook for solutions, not arguments.", "YTA.  You act like it is just him holding his phone.  He said he was set up there and asked you to wait.  Did you ask how long?  Couldn't you guys discuss this beforehand?  You fasting makes no difference.  While you felt urgency, you lack of planning does not allow you to trample on him.", "ESH. \n\nYou guys need to talk ahead of time about the working arrangements to avoid these situations.", "ESH, you shouldn't interrupt his work, and he should work in his room so kitchen is free to use for both of you.", "YTA. He gave you a simple solution and asked politely, and you acted like you'd starve to death if you didn't get the specific food you wanted where you wanted it right at that moment. Anyone can harp on about how the kitchen is for cooking or whatever, but that's not how people live their lives. A conflict arose and you acted like a brat and escalated instead of just barely inconveniencing yourself by carrying a little blender to a different outlet. The correct, non-asshole solution would have been to act like an adult and then afterward have an adult conversation about how to prevent such a conflict from happening again.", "I think NTA here.\n\nCould you have waited for your brother to finish the meeting?  Maybe, but you didn\u2019t say how long said meeting was maybe it would completely overlap your break.\n\nYou said you would set up in the office area before which sounds to be adjacent from the kitchen.  Is there a reason he couldn\u2019t set up in there initially to at least somewhat distance himself from the noise?  It seems weird he would set himself up in the kitchen which is a shared space and get mad when it\u2019s used as a shared space.  I sometimes wfh outside, but I\u2019m not mad at my neighbors making noise when I\u2019m in a meeting.  I move back inside and continue.\n\nYour brother couldn\u2019t mute himself for a minute while you blended your drink, yet could easily get up and argue with you over the whole ordeal?  If it were me, I would\u2019ve just gotten fed up enough and moved.  Getting up to argue disproves the point you need to pay attention to the meeting constantly.\n\nthis whole thing sounds like a case of sibling rivalry, even the parent interaction.  are you the older brother by chance?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s a shared cooking area, you have as much right to use it when you want as he does.", "He was on a work call in the kitchen when you wanted to use the *blender*, a.k.a. the loudest appliance in any kitchen? Assuming this is an isolated incident and he doesn't have a habit of using the kitchen as his personal office and disrupting your meals, I'm going with YTA. Just grab some crackers or fruit or something if you're that hungry and wait for him to be done with his call. It's common decency.", "NTA. Why is your brother using the kitchen as his office?", "NTA.  Everyone thinks they are right.   The reality is that everyone could have avoided the argument.  Clearly brother leads at failure to compromise.   He should have immediately moved to the available area.   Hands on and yelling makes him the aggressor.  Brother seems to see himself as entitled, hence the expectation that you should accede to his wishes.   Parents favored him in a knee jerk reaction which supports brother's misguided expectation of entitlement.   It appears to me that the deck is stacked against you, but you could have avoided it all by choosing something else to eat.   I am not suggesting that you should have.  Just could have.  IMO your entire family are assholes.   You may not be able to unstack the deck, but you can make adjustments so that you won't need anything from brother again.  For example ... buy yourself a blender and put it somewhere convenient to you, but not to him.  However you decide to proceed, smooth sailing and a following sea.", "To answer the first half of your info question: I\u2019m confused on who\u2019s right here so I\u2019m asking for clarification. For the second part idk what to tell you", "He was on a conference zoom call on his phone. He was muted for 95% of the time, I know how these meetings go I\u2019ve been in them. He had the time to mute the whole thing and argue with me instead, so it\u2019s not some crucial meeting", "Who tf works in the kitchen on his phone?", "And this somehow justifies a physical assault?", "This was nothing personal; I was just hungry", "It\u2019s the kitchen. He should pick a better place to have a meeting in instead of the shared cooking area.", "This was brought up, but I would have to take the blender and all of the ingredients to make the drink to my room and blend it when they\u2019re already in the kitchen. It would be easier for him to go to his room", "He's in the kitchen. No one gets to take over the kitchen for a work meeting. Brother is the one guilty of lack of planning here.\n\nIf he can yell and physically fight about it, he can move his phone/laptop to somewhere that isn't preventing somone else from using the shared facilities.", "Well said!", "Did I say that?", "Sure, in the future, he should, but we're talking about this specific incident.\nYes He picked a bad place to work that day,  but Why is it a problem to carry the blender out of the room? It was an easy fix until the zoom was over, and they could discuss the location of his future work spaces.", "He was working, sure he picked a bad spot, but you could have been inconvenienced for a few minutes then discussed work areas after the call.", "Pretty much by assigning all blame on her.  You know there is a three letter acronym you can use when multiple people are at fault.", "And in the past he should have as well. Why is it a problem to carry his phone out of the room? Since he shouldn't have been taking up the kitchen in the first place?", "I agree, and that seems to be the ruling here. Sometimes I just don\u2019t want to do favors. If my reasoning is in the right and it\u2019s a matter of \u201cgiving grace\u201d then im not always up to do that. If rules were in place then things like this would be fixed, and they are now. I just don\u2019t agree with the idea that because I don\u2019t want to do someone a favor, then I\u2019m an AH", "I didn't say physical assault was justified it at all. I just said OP is an asshole for being noisy when someone was already in the kitchen on the phone. I'd be mad too.", "It's not about doing favors. It's about compromise.\nA favor is here let me drop that off at the post office for you.\nA compromise is ok this guy wasn't thinking and set up shop in the kitchen, since it's work let me just grab my shit make my smoothie in another room and talk about it when his shift  is over \nWhen we dig in our heels and refuse to budge, it makes us unreasonable and makes it hard for people to work together."]}
