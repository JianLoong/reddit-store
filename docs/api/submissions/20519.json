We are a happy couple, but my husband is quite introverted and doesn't like confrontation. He avoids it whenever possible, which is something I love about him, but it also means that I often have to be the one to stick up for us when people say things that are hurtful or disrespectful.\n\nThis happened last weekend when my brothers (32M and 25M) came over for a family dinner. My older brother has always been a bit of a joker, but lately, he's been making more and more comments about how my husband is \"too quiet\" and \"doesn't talk enough\" when we're all together. My younger brother has been joining in, and they've started making fun of my husband behind his back, calling him things like \"the mute\" and \"the ghost.\"\n\nI tried to ignore it at first, but it was really bothering me, so I finally spoke up and told them that their comments were hurtful and disrespectful. My older brother laughed it off and said he was just joking, but I could tell that my younger brother was upset that I had called them out. He started getting defensive and accusing me of being too sensitive.\n\nThings escalated from there, and we ended up getting into a big fight. My brothers accused me of being overprotective of my husband and not being able to take a joke. I told them that they were being rude and that I didn't appreciate them insulting my husband behind his back. My older brother eventually apologized, but my younger brother stormed out of the house and hasn't spoken to me since.\n\nNow I'm left wondering if I overreacted. Maybe I should have just let it go and not confronted them. But at the same time, I feel like I had to stick up for my husband and our marriage. He's a wonderful person, and he doesn't deserve to be treated that way.\n\nSo, Reddit, Am I the Asshole for getting into a fight with my brothers over their rude comments about my introverted husband?", "created_utc": 1687660194, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14iait0/aita_for_getting_into_a_fight_with_my_older_and/", "score": 190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As such, I'm not a very confrontational person, but I feel so grateful that you stood up for your man. \n\nTell your brothers that while they believed they were only joking, it's not always fun for the other side. Tell them, how would you feel if you felt constantly targeted without doing anything wrong? Because that's how it's being perceived, even if they don't realize it. As they've become brother in laws now, they should be more supportive and caring, and can still make jokes, but just be nicer about it.

You\u2019re a good wife, and they were rude AF - they deserved to be called out, and they are in their mid-20s to early-30s.

Hope he doesn't repeat his asshole comments at the expense of your DH for his own entertainment. Also do not let your younger brother inside your home. Your home is also your husband's home, he needs to feel safe and comfortable in his own home. \n\nWhile you're at it, I also need to tell you that if anybody tells you to apologize to your brothers and to be the \"bigger person\" to keep up with the peace in the name of \"family\" , do not at all apologize to anybody. You did no wrong in protecting your own husband.
