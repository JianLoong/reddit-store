He's a good dog and he's great with Christopher too. But yesterday John wanted to play baseball with Christopher and when Christopher went to catch the ball, Chumba was running behind him at the same time and Christopher ran in to Chumba and he landed on him. It scared Chumba, who barked and ran off. Him barking scared Christopher, who ran to me crying.

The dog wasn't hurt, he was spooked. Just like Christopher wasn't hurt either, he was spooked. I told him that I didn't appreciate him coming at me like that and that I wasn't going to force my son to apologize to a dog for hurting it when he didn't hurt it.

They understand comfort too when they're scared or hurt.\n\nWhile your partner expecting your son to apologise immediately to Chumba is overly, you encouraging your son to interact with the dog in an apologetic and comforting way after the accident would have helped both your son and Chumba get over their surprise quicker.

And I say that as someone who *always, profusely* apologizes to my three dogs when I accidentally step on a paw/tail, kick a chin that is following me too closely up the stairs, etc. (And no, they don't apologize to me when they accidentally grind their nails into my bare foot or whack me in the face with a bony tail, but I have no doubt that they would if they could.) Yes, I realize that they don't understand my words, but they understand my tone, and that matters. \n\nSo while I would otherwise ordinarily have said that accidentally hurting (or startling) a person or animal is sufficient reason for offering a simple apology, in light of their reasoning, I'm going to say no, don't do it. Because their justification is absolutely bonkers.", "INFO-it sounds like they both ran into each other? As long as he understands to be careful/aware of animals I don't see what good 'apologizing' to the dog would do. Unless this story is embellished, I don't see why he'd feel one or the other 'owed' an apology between a toddler and a dog, neither of which are very good at spatial awareness", "That's ridiculous. That's a false dichotomy and slippery slope fallacy all in one. Also just incorrect.", "As a dog owner, first mistake was having a dog free while playing ball with a kid.", "Thank you! Thought I was the only one think WTF.\n\nI love dogs, I apologize if I accidentally even bump into them, same for cats.  \n\nThe little kid was scared and crying and the BF didn't make the dog \"apologize\", and further he didn't ask how the kid was before snapping at mom.\n\nI don't think I could stay with someone like that.  Dog lover yes, but dog lover over crying scared human child, never.", "In my experience, there are two understandings of the words \"apology.\" One is an admission of having done wrong and asking for forgiveness, ex: \"I'm sorry I walked into you on the sidewalk.\" The other is an expression of sympathy and empathy, ex: I am sorry you are going through a divorce.\" \n\nIn these circumstances, I would encourage my kid to apologize (express sympathy) to the dog so that both my kid and the dog would bond better and get past the scare they likely both had.", "While I agree that John had quite an overreaction, it's not about a literal apology to me. And that's not how I read the comment you replied to either. More of an opportunity to explain to Christopher that accidents happen, and the doggo was okay, but maybe they could calmly just \"hug it out\", so to speak, to ensure that both dog and child would be comfortable around each other in the future. Not in any way to place blame or to scold, but to make sure neither party is hesitant to be friends with each other in the future.", "My dog apologizes to me if he accidentally smacks me hard with his tail or paw.", "It really could have gone really badly, like if they both reached for the ball together, and the dog inadvertently hit the child.  So so so badly\u2026.", "What a load of crap. The kid is THREE, not 13. He and the dog are literally at the same mental level right now. Maybe the dog should apologize!", "The dog won\u2019t remember the incident the next day, the child will. He\u2019s THREE and potentially got hurt from falling and was then barked at by an animal that is threatening to a toddler. Dogs deserve love and respect but if comparing a human child to a dog, a human child will ALWAY be more important.", "I'll give you that; in this day and age with a lot of people owning dogs and a new \"pet parent\" culture, Idk.  But I do think in situations like that, the child takes precedence.  (Idrc that I got downvoted; here for the tea same as everyone else)", ">How would that help the dog?\n\nIt wouldn't. Obviously. Dogs don't understand human language.\n\nBut that's not the point of teaching young children to apologize, the point is to teach them that other people (and other living things) have feelings.\n\nI do think it's interesting that you blame the accident on the boyfriend...OP didn't. And OP's objection wasn't that it wasn't their kid's fault...their objection was that the dog wasn't \"hurt\". That's a tacit admission that the kid was at fault, and it certainly sounds like OP would have had the kid apologize if they believed the dog was injured.", "But do they expect the same from a master?", "Sounds like bf saw the situation differently", "I get apology licks lol", "My daughter is 21 months, she's been raised around dogs and animals and cares for them, it's not hard to teach empathy. She's accidentally pulled his hair etc, but she has been taught to be gentle afterwards. Her dog is her guardian and she knows it. YTA", "Three year old children already understand empathy.\n\nSo do dogs.\n\nDog has probably already apologized by wagging tail and trying to be close to the child, licking cheek.  Kid can apologize by hugging dog.\n\nBody language - a dialect everyone speaks.", "The child absolutely takes precedence.  No question.  I blame BF because he should have been managing the dog, you can\u2019t have a little kid and big dog both trying to catch the same ball!  It\u2019s just not safe, and there are many ways the kid can be hurt.  If the child had been bitten, even by accident, (hand and both grabbing ball\u2026)that would end up really bad for the dog\u2026", "OP is wrong to not blame the BF.  Imagine if the child and dog reaches for the ball at the same time, and the kid\u2019s hand got bitten.  It could have gone so so so badly.  If a preschooler is chasing a ball tossed *to them*, and a dog comes up from behind, it\u2019s virtually always the dog owner\u2019s fault and not the kid.  The kid doesn\u2019t have the maturity or even physical skill to watch out for the dog and avoid it.", "I suppose that would depend on what the dogs temperament is, rather like humans. Some are forgiving when their emotional needs are not acknowledged or met, while others bite back, quite literally.", "I didn't say small children don't have empathy. I'm disagreeing that they need to be taught it like this.", "So if your toddler fell, as toddlers often do, and the dog instinctively bit her or something, would you still make her apologize? Assuming you\u2019re a decent parent, of course you wouldn\u2019t because that isn\u2019t a teachable moment, it\u2019s an accident in which a child was afraid and hurt."]}
