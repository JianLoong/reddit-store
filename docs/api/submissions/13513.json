During that time, I have never spoken to my neighbour for more than an introduction when we first met and the occasional and very brief hello in passing.\n\nDuring our time in the house, his kids and partner have disturbed us daily with screaming and shouting as well as one of his children climbing into pur garden multiple times to collect things he's thrown over. On top of this all, we have called the police on them already during our time here to report his domestic abuse of his partner which we witnessed first hand during the summer last year. Needless to say, he's a real piece of work and I want nothing do with him.\n\nBack to this evening, at 8:30pm (GMT) I heard a knock on the door and went to answer it. My neighbour greets me and immediately asks if my Wi-Fi  is working to which I tell him it is. He then explains that his is down and that they can't get an engineer out until Tuesday next week to fix it. Finally, he asks if he can use my Wi-Fi until his is up. I'm immediately hesitant because I wouldn't typically trust anyone with that information (let alone him) and he picks up on that and insists that he won't do anything dodgy on it. I tell him that our Wi-Fi isn't the strongest and that I don't think I'm comfortable with it. \n\nAgain he insists that he isn't doing anything dodgy and insists that he can't go the weekend without it. I'm insistent and tell him that me and my fiance are watching something at the moment and can't spare the connection for him. He grunts, says \"No problem Kid\" and walks off (I'm 24 so not a kid).\n\nIs his response normal for something that I'm assuming he deems as a standard neighbourly request which isn't or AITA for being biased towards him for his actions and not trusting him?", "created_utc": 1680121081, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125zft7/aita_for_keeping_my_wifi_to_myself/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The problem is once you let them start using your wyfi they get rid of their own. They keep using it until you change the password and still ask for the new password. It\u2019s safer nowadays not to do it.

We're friendly with our neighbor... not really friends, but we say hi, sometimes we'll chat/small talk in the yard if we both happen to be out there at the same time.

I activate it *only* when we have guests or have another reason to have a lower-security network.\n\nNobody, *nobody*, gets our \"real\" wifi password.  But our house guests don't need it.  If a neighbor needed to \"borrow\" it for a few days, I think I'd probably do this (and turn it off again after those few days).", "Given you two already have an adversarial relationship, hard NTA. You'd be NTA anyway but this sounds like the kind of guy that would look up dodgey stuff just to mess with you for the police calls.", "NTA -- your neighbors have been douchebags to you, and you don't owe them anything.

Definitely not. This isn't something anyone would normally expect to do.

It's mainly because my fiance (who is maybe too kind for her own good) questioned it and said that she would have given the password over straight away that I thought I might be in the wrong. Clearly I was right to stick to my initial decision.", "NTA. Within the intricate tapestry of interpersonal interactions and demarcated boundaries, you retain the unassailable prerogative to exert sovereignty over the resources and amenities to which you lay claim, encompassing the ethereal realm of your wireless internet connectivity. The predilection for bestowing access to such amenities upon others is contingent upon individual dispositions, and you are by no means obligated to capitulate to your neighbor's solicitations, particularly given the turbulent chronicle and absence of congenial rapport betwixt you.\n\nYour apprehension apropos the potential malfeasance with your digital conduit and the concomitant implications for your personal privacy and cybersecurity is unequivocally warranted. The volition to withhold ingress to your Wi-Fi ought not to be misconstrued as an act of inimicality or incivility; rather, it constitutes a sagacious exercise of circumspection and self-preservation. Ergo, you are not the malefactor in this quandary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
