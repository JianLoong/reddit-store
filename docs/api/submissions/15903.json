I was given an amazing childhood and I used to thank God everyday that these amazing people had wanted to adopt me. \nWhen I turned 18 we moved to Atlanta to be around all of the family. Before that it was just my mom, dad and my sister. Now after the move it was a million aunties and uncles. A billion cousins and a brother that had moved out of the house before I was adopted.\nAfter the move was the only time my race had ever been spoken of in a negative way. If I did something good it was \"pretty good for a white boy\" and if I did something wrong it was \"Sherry why did you go and adopt a white baby? What was wrong with the black ones?\"\nThis all got worse when I started dating in college.\nMy first serious girlfriend was white. It wasn't a conscious thing of \" I need to date a white girl because I'm white\" it's just who I was attracted to at that time. She was smart and funny if a bit shy.\nMy family hated it. I introduced her to my more immediate family during a family dinner. It wasn't halfway through dinner that I heard the words \"You too uppity for a black girl?\" Leave my grandfather's mouth and the entire table laughed.\nThat relationship fizzled out after a few weeks.\nLast week though we had our first family cookout of the season and I was excited to introduce my boyfriend to the family. My black boyfriend at that. It's no secret that I'm bisexual. I had come out to the family when I moved to Atlanta and they had all been supportive.\nUntil I walked into the backyard with a black man. You could hear a pin drop I swear to god. The uncles stopped playing dice and the aunties paused their game of spades, that's how big of a deal it was.\nAnd all because me a white man \"was stealing a black man.\"\nOh they had all kinds of questions for him.\n\"How did he trap you into dating him\"\nWas the most common, probably because they could pass it off as a joke.\nWhat they really meant was: Why are you fucking this white boy?\n\nAnd so I left. My momma begged me to come back and calm down and for the first time in my life I disobeyed her. I made my mother fall on her knees and sob. When she tried to get up and hug me I pushed her arms away. I told her how she allowed our family to make me feel. How I had been made to feel for a long time. Like I was the fucked up cat with mange and rabies she brought home and now it's too late to get rid of me. She calls everyday now, but I need space.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1682697249, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131ymoe/aita_for_losing_my_shit_and_storming_out_of_a/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
