Seems like it's time to let him sink if he doesn't want to swim. You shouldn't be expected to be the breadwinner AND do everything at home. Stay at your mom's until he changes or leave him for good.", "NTA I have been in your situation. I wish I had left the relationship sooner. I feel now I let him have too many excuses. \nIf you are going to stay with this guy there has to be goals for him\ntherapy, job and household roster. If he can't do these things then you really have to evaluate your situation. I let it go on for 15 years. Wish I have him 2 years Max to get his shit together. \n\nYou can spend your birthday however you want and do whatever makes you happy.", "NTA. What is your husband doing with his time? The working roles are reversed now, so the household/childcare chores should be too.", "NTA. \n\nWhy are you allowing your husband to take advantage of you like this? You are doing way too much in this relationship. He\u2019s 31 years old and basically has no responsibilities. You may as well categorize him as your 2nd child verses being your spouse. He needs to start behaving like a real father to his kid and a proper partner to you. \n\nIf he\u2019s struggling with depression, he needs to seek out mental health resources to help him through it. In the meantime though OP, you need to have a much needed conversation with him about pulling his weight and getting a job so that things are not all on your shoulders. Give him a deadline for finding work so he doesn\u2019t continue procrastinating. \n\nOp, you are too young to be dealing with this much stress. You are going to burn  yourself out before you\u2019re 30 if you continue on this path. You don\u2019t want to end up 7 more years down the line wondering what happened with your life. Take a stand and don\u2019t back down.", "NTA. It was your birthday and obviously he thinks what he wanted for YOUR birthday was more important than what you wanted for yourself. Doesn't matter what he planned, you obviously had time to pack up the baby and leave so I'm sure he had warning.  Also, his depression shouldn't be his excuse to be weak.   He needs to do better. Happy belated birthday and i hope you enjoyed it!", "NTA. \u201c\\[Husband\\] I know you\u2019re depressed but I can\u2019t continue to work 2 jobs while being responsible for all bills and childcare and housework and somehow cheer you up on my birthday too.

And then you become pregnant at 20? \nI can't help but feel like he went for an younger, inexperienced woman because he himself lacks accountability and maturity, and now has the audacity to still act that way, load his emotional garbage on you and all the chores that comes with being an adult, and then also emotionally manipulate you into feeling guilty enough to ask reddit, whenever you're the asshole for demanding some dignity and respect and fairness. \n\nListen, be won't change. Change requires work, and that energy and work will only be put to use if it's really necessary. His life is way to comfortable atm for him to actually change.", "NTA. Your husband is a dead weight. Consider counseling.", "NTA. Your life sounds joyless.", "NTA - when you were unemployed you did all the housework, childcare, pet care, everything. But now that you\u2019re the employed one and your husband isn\u2019t, he still expects you to do all that and work. That isn\u2019t fair to you at all. He\u2019s contributing nothing to this relationship, and he needs to pick up the slack if he wants this to work.", "NTA\n\nSeems like you two need to communicate and seek pro help if there isn\u2019t any change.", "NTA\n\nMaybe he is not wrong to want to celebrate your birthday with him but he is wrong to expect you to do all the cooking and household chores. Both should share the equal responsibilities rather than burdening other with all the work. \n\nTalk things out and make plans to spend time with each other rather than him expecting you to cook.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he wants you to have more free time, he needs to pull his weight. If he\u2019s depressed so badly that he can\u2019t work or contribute to your family or household, that\u2019s an emergency. He needs to get on meds, do some inpatient care, be under the regular care of a psych professional. There are solutions, and if he wants to stay married he needs to find them. \n\nPartnership is about sharing the work of life, and if all you do is make life harder, you are not a partner. Just another child to care for but worse, because at least a child can follow instructions and have babysitters.", "[removed]", "NTA. If he is as depressed as he claims then I doubt his \"big plans\" would have happened. Mental health issues do not give you a free pass to be bone idle, he needs to be working on himself, with the aid of professionals, and your support of course. With all you are doing though too much is already being asked of you. I can understand why you went to your mum's for your birthday, being around people like your husband can make what should be the most joyful event into a wake. May I suggest to start iff trying to make things better by talking to your husband and laying down some ground rules? Having some order in life does help those with depression. Obviously so much more is needed of course but you have to start somewhere.", "No your not, book him an appointment at the doctors if he doesn't go then ask him to live elsewhere while he deals with himself", "Well, knowing he had \u2018big plans\u2019 for you and then going over to your mother\u2019s is a bit of an asshole move. Also, depression can make it impossible to do any of the daily tasks we need to, from self-care to house care.\n\nHowever - if he\u2019s depressed then he needs to see his doctor or a mental health specialist. It\u2019s not a \u2018get out of housework free\u2019 card. And I hate kitchen hoverers too. Sit down at the table, have a drink and a chat is fine, but don\u2019t be underfoot! He needs to start pulling his weight, and to see someone about his mental health too. You\u2019re not his mum, and he needs to step up and help out. Breaking his birthday plans is a bit of an asshole move, tho. Mild ESH.", "I think we are missing some info here. Was the husband working all the 5 years while she was at home? If yes, then it would be a rather asshole move to give up now after 1 year of taking care of things while he did it for 5. Also if he has depressions, then that is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.
