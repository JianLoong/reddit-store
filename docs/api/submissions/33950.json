It was a complete blindside but I accepted it, I'm not going to force her to stay if shes not happy.

Now im getting abuse from her for not going to stay with family while she stays at the house I pay for and worked hard to get us into with our daughter and instead she's having to call and visit when she can.

I can almost guarantee if she stayed in the apartment she would still be expecting you to pay for it.\n\nMake sure your daughter is safe and cared for", "NTA, do not leave that house. she wanted out so out she goes. go to court set up a parenting plan with custody and child support and be done with it. she doesn\u2019t want you but she wants what you do for her.", "NTA - Based on this alone, you're the only one who knows the whole truth though. For sure get a lawyer, tell your landlord she's gone and get her off the lease ASAP. Make sure your daughter is taken care of, that's about all I got.", "NTA- If the house is in your name only, then she can\u2019t stay there. I would talk to a lawyer to make sure she has legally vacated the home as opposed you need to start eviction proceedings. I would also start gathering documentation, evidence,  bank statements etc. to prove you supported her/the child. She might lawyer up and find a loophole to go after back child support.", "NTA  \nI might be wrong, and making lots of assumptions here - but here goes.  \n\n\nSo.. she's the one that decided to go away and visit with friends, then comes back and break up the family right before Christmas.  Then she decides that she can't handle the heat in the kitchen that she cooked up as a little sumethin' to brighten up your new year, and toddles off to friends.. again, without any care about your child - who I assume she used to stay at home to care for, as you've mentioned nowhere that she held down a job as well.  \n\n\nI'm not sure what you have contributed to the situation as you mentioned that you've not been easy to live with and are medicated now, but despite that, she didn't make clever decisions in relation even remotely sitting down with you to work out exactly how things would be before she moved out or who would care for the child going forward.  It sounds like she has her own issues, - the fear of confrontation being one of them.  She sounds like she has a lot of soul searching and growing up to do, but not at the expense of wrecking the child's security, routine, and familiar surroundings.  \n\n\nSomeone had to stay on board to look after the little one and she certainly wasn't putting up her hand.", "NTA\n\nAre you married? Because that makes a difference.\n\nDid you buy the house together? Another thing that makes a difference.\n\nShe left 4 with you so clearly has no interest in parenting.

Does she even have any claim on the house?", "YTA for how much information you're leaving out, which makes me suspect your ex's side of the story would be very different than this. What are these \"moments\" and \"not being the easiest person to life with\"? When you say you are \"working on your issues\", are your issues *solved* or do you still have them?\n\nWho was the primary carer of your daughter? If you were working, was it your ex? If you were working while your ex was a SAHM, she was doing a job too. You were in the workforce while she did an equally important job at home. In those circumstances, it's not exclusively your income and it's not exclusively your house. \n\nWhy did your ex decide she \"didn't want to be together any more\"? Why after Christmas did she decide she \"couldn't be here any more\"?\n\nIf your ex was the primary carer, is your daughter now in the care of you and all your \"issues\" and \"moments\"? And are you willing to have your daughter abruptly separated from her primary carer? \n\nI'm not saying we know who should get to stay in the house. We have no idea what exactly happened in your relationship because you're not telling us. But you left out a lot of the details, and your ex left and made herself homeless with no plan.
