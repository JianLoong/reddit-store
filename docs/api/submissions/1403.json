ESH", "NTA- call the clinic and report that tech because that was extremely rude and unprofessional", "NTA.  I would have called their bluff and said go ahead call the police.  Now I would make a formal complaint to the owner of the clinic.  Outrageous behavior.", "NTA.  The tech became rude and aggressive with you unnecessarily.", "NTA. She should have checked your ID if the policy is that important.", "NTA, 100%.\n\nBig yikes.  I normally try to play the mediator in these posts and recognize the merit to both sides, but if he was genuinely concerned he should\u2019ve just asked for an ID \u2014 and I have no idea why he refused your offer to produce it.\n\nThere is just no way he would actually get in any trouble for this \u2014 even if you *were* lying, how the hell would anyone know?\n\nJust a ridiculous situation, and absolutely not your fault.  Leaving was the mature decision, and your reaction certainly wasn\u2019t excessive.  Well done, dude. He\u2019s a loser.", "I\u2019m going ESH. There are rules for her to follow, and if you knew you had ID you could have pulled it out the first time. I don\u2019t think either of you needed to get to the yelling. The rules surrounding private clinics are pretty lengthy and they are there for a reason. A nurse isn\u2019t going to lose her job or get written up for taking your word for it.", "NTA - she should have asked for ID. Please report her to the clinic ; especially since your brother might not be able to make another appt.", "It all sounds really weird but you're only TA if your SIL thinks you are.  I don't know if she's telling you the truth or not, only you can judge that.  Being pregnant makes you vulnerable and hormonal and you should just do whatever makes her happy in those situations.  I really don't know why they cared so much about you attending if you were not mucking around like a kid.", "YTA\n\nYou knew the rules and you knew you had ID.\n\nWhy not show it like the grown up you are supposed to be rather than behaving like a stroppy child?", "ESH\n\nThe tech should have handled it better, without shouting.\n\nOP - why did this interaction escalate so much before you told them you had an ID on you and could prove your age?  If you look underage, they\u2019re going to err on the side of caution.  Arguing that \u201cI\u2019m obviously not a little kid\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m the baby\u2019s aunt\u201d isn\u2019t going to accomplish anything except making you seem defensive.", "NTA at all, but why not just show her your id? She shouldn't have reacted the way she did, but it would have solved the question.", "NTA I would call the office and complain about that tech", "EDIT: Changing vote to ESH\n\nYou had ID, so why didn't you simply pull out your ID first thing?  I'm not sure why this got to the arguing/shouting stage at all.  \n\n\nHowever, it seems the technician was on some sort of weird power trip as well.", "NTA - the tech was out of line, majorly.", "NTA. You should call the clinic and complaint, though.  There was no reason for you or SIL to go through that.", "Or they could have just shown the ID they had right at the beginning."]}
