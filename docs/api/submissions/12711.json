I am curious does your country not also have these options where staff can unlock the trolley for you if you don't have the change or tokens", "You got to have a quarter to unlock a cart or exchange with someone in the parking lot.

BTDT  more than one, because I GAVE AWAY my quarter by giving someone my cart the previous time & all they had was 2dimes&a nickel. So I had no quarter the next time i went, and that sort of sucked.\n\nFor non-aldi shoppers (in the usa anyway) the typical interaction is the other person handing you a quarter as they approach you, and you hand over the cart. That way you don't have to hook up your cart and struggle with getting the thing in the thing and taking your quarter back out.  Or maybe that's just me and the shitty carts sitting out in the humid air. Humidity fuck things up, so I default to blaming it for everything.\n\nNormally, I'd be like \"its just a quarter!\" but it really isn't, because then I usually fuck myself over and then I am unprepared for the next trip to get groceries.

That's entitlement. And no one is entitled to something someone else has\n\nIt may be a pain in the ass, but going in, buying a soda, paying with card and asking for cash back, then asking the cashier to break that bill and have $1 in quarters- is still an option.
