I am curious does your country not also have these options where staff can unlock the trolley for you if you don't have the change or tokens", "You got to have a quarter to unlock a cart or exchange with someone in the parking lot.

BTDT  more than one, because I GAVE AWAY my quarter by giving someone my cart the previous time & all they had was 2dimes&a nickel. So I had no quarter the next time i went, and that sort of sucked.\n\nFor non-aldi shoppers (in the usa anyway) the typical interaction is the other person handing you a quarter as they approach you, and you hand over the cart. That way you don't have to hook up your cart and struggle with getting the thing in the thing and taking your quarter back out.  Or maybe that's just me and the shitty carts sitting out in the humid air. Humidity fuck things up, so I default to blaming it for everything.\n\nNormally, I'd be like \"its just a quarter!\" but it really isn't, because then I usually fuck myself over and then I am unprepared for the next trip to get groceries.

That's entitlement. And no one is entitled to something someone else has\n\nIt may be a pain in the ass, but going in, buying a soda, paying with card and asking for cash back, then asking the cashier to break that bill and have $1 in quarters- is still an option.

So it's kind of an AH move.", "I would actually really love to track how these have disseminated this way.", "Where I live most carts are unlocked since CoViD. They didn't bother to lock them again. I still have a chip on my keys just in case.", ">the brother that owned Aldi North bought a small California based grocery chain and expanded that throughout the United States. That store: Trader Joe's.\n\nTIL", "There\u2019s one grocery store near my parents place that have that AND you have to unlock it with a $1 coin.", "You have service desks at ALDI?", "Which is a-ok by me because their prices are way cheaper than anywhere else near me", "I'm glad we're not the only ones. We have those in Italy. Lifesavers.", "Same I'm in California and had no idea what the quarter deal was", "Is it really charging you if they give the money back like in this case?", "Omg I'm legitimately stressed out over not getting these. I have no idea why", "This is the greatest thing ever. I'm gonna live in that bucket hat and fanny pack combo", "Well they did have an eagle until they started making all the quarters 'special'.", "It's not the amount that matters here. It's that they just expected you to give them your cart. It wouldn't have mattered if it was a penny... they were in the wrong for expecting you give them your cart and then got getting shitty cuz you wouldn't. If they didn't have a quarter they shouldn't have gone to Aldi's. It might have been a different outcome if they had said they didn't have a quarter and then nicely asked for your cart. I'm glad you didn't give them the cart. NTA OP", "Lol! When someone passes me an Aldi's cart and waves off my quarter, I always pass the cart on the same way...free. I never give up my own Aldi's quarter, though.\n\nI keep that Aldi's cart quarter on my dashboard. I always pay everything with a debit card and never have loose change except for my Aldi's quarter. The hassle of remembering to go somewhere and try to snag change before I need to stop at Aldi's again is ridiculous, so I hang on to that one quarter.\n\nLike you experienced, some woman tried to take my cart w/o passing a quarter over. I said, \"Oh, sorry! That's my only Aldi's quarter.\"\n\nAs I retrieved my quarter, she snarled, \"Cheap ASSHOLE!\" at me. Lmaoooooo. \n\nI said, \"Yeah...but I'm an asshole with a quarter. You're just an asshole.\"", "YTA Any time someone has asked for my cart I have just given it to them. If they then hand me a quarter (or change) then great. But it is a frickin quarter. I am happy to help someone out and don't need to be stingy. And no, I don't have extra money. SAHM to two kids whose husband makes 6 dollars under our area's \"living wage\" But I still am not going to demand a quarter especially when it is so easy to forget change.\n\nTwo days ago husband and I were walking in with zero change because I forgot, but also cuz I just didn't have any. My husband always gives our daughter any change and she puts it in her piggy bank. Anyway, so walking in with a toddler and an infant in a car seat. He thought maybe the lady leaving the store would kindly give us a cart if he explained we forgot change. Nope. Too stingy. So I waited just inside the store as my husband exchanged a dollar for some change. He had to wait in the longest and slowest line I have ever seen in aldi's. It took forever to get the quarter. And we had to exchange a dollar, they would not just give him a quarter or a cart. Luckily we had a dollar. I don't know. You really cannot just give someone your cart? Why? If you were homeless and literally NEEDED that quarter, okay. But come on. Actually a homeless person would probably give up the cart because the less a person has the more generous they tend to be.", "nta, aldi gives change for quarters", "Did they give you the quarter?", "Maybe they didn\u2019t know that Aldi requires a quarter to shop there.", "Nta. A quarter for a quarter. Everyone knows the rule.", "NTA, that mom is so unpleasant and is setting such a poor example for her kids. That\u2019s the truly sad part.", "NTA.\n\nIn my place, the shopping cart takes a dollar, which I can only get it back when I returned it. It's so obvious the family wants you to sacrifice your quarter for them, why should you?", "Never heard of Aldi before but I read that its a grocery chain. \n\nCan someone please tell me why a quarter is needed though? Confused", "T,The y22w\u2075", "If they had come up and asked nicely saying they had no change and could they please get your cart would you have given it to them? If so then NTA. If they can\u2019t even ask nicely though then why should anyone do any favours. Where have manners disappeared to?! I have been given things you wouldn\u2019t believe simply by asking nicely over the years but I have also given many favours and gone a long way out of my way to help people too if they have been kind and polite. A good attitude goes a long way and rude people irk me so I may have done the same in your place had they behaved like that.", "It's not about body language, it's about entitlement. They wanted your quarter. but I say\n\nno quarter asked none given in today's society, so\n\nDefinitely,\n\nNTA.", "You can buy token here in Australia, I keep one in my console. I wish o could remember to keep bags in the car too", "NTA, and what the hell, you guys only have to put an equivalent 25p in the Aldi cart? In the UK you need to put \u00a31 in.", "FYI most ALDI stores will hand over a quarter or a cart to people if they come in and admit they forgot to bring any change.", "NTA. It's really nice and kind when people just hand over their trolley and don't worry about the coin, as their good deed for the day. It's absolutely not a requirement, though. \n\nI do think the way you approached it sounds kinda rude, why go straight on the attack like that?", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, why can\u2019t they pay like everyone else and get their quarter back?", "I found myself with only dimes and nickels and I looked for someone I could ask to let me have the cart for dimes and nickels. Of course they said no problem and I gave them my change. But I would not expect anyone to just give me a cart because I\u2019m standing there. They need to stop those stupid carts though. My local grocery store has some kind of sensor that make them dysfunctional if you take it out of the parking lot. Sometimes you\u2019ll see abandoned carts on the sidewalk but they get put away eventually. That\u2019s better than remembering a damn quarter.  So I\u2019m going to go with mild AH since they were rude.", "Yes! I too have a car Aldi quarter!!!! And a backup one in my fleece pocket just in case", "L?", "You get the quarter back when you return the cart. Basically every supermarket in Germany uses this system and it works well. It\u2019s very rare to see people leave their carts scattered in the parking lot.", "Yeah, where I am most stores use a locking system that takes a $1 coin (Canada's smallest bill is a 5, there are coins for $1 and $2). I have a keychain that unlocks it so I don't have to fuck around with keeping track of a loonie, lol. And the effect is the same, I still have to put the cart back to get my keys out of it.", "funny as poor as I have been and I mean not eating poor, I have always had a quarter somewhere.", "In german ita a euro. I never have change i have a plastic disk that i put in as most germans have. Newest are push in and pull out so there is no change in the cart and i usually look if i can find someone wanting a cart", "> In Australia it\u2019s a choice between a $1 or $2 coin or a token which costs me $2.\n\nI carry an out-of-date \u00a31 coin in my purse for trolleys and lockers.", "Someone I know had a teenage child who collected trolleys for Coles.  They took their unlocker one night and copied it and 3D printed a whole heap for us.  It's brilliant.  No need to carry change, and I don't have to worry about getting it back at the end.", "I bought a trolley key for a couple of bucks on eBay and now I never have to have a coin or a token. Nor does anyone who comes up while I'm getting my own trolley.", "The idea behind the quarter thing is that it makes people bring back ans stacking the shopping carts by themselves, because there will be no employee to oversee those carts. \n\nI guess in the US it's a way to use less employees as Aldi tries to reduce costs as much as possible,  but in germany,  where Aldi is from, ALL grocery stores use this system including expensive ones", "I had something like that back in primary school. We used to play this game where we'd spin a quarter like a top, and take turns flicking it to keep it spinning. The person that knocked it over / off the table / took too long to flick, lost the game. Surprisingly fun. Probably wouldn't work for adults though, hands got too big. Wait, isn't that one of Gaetz' philosophies?\n\nAnyways, made a little keychain pouch for my quarter. Made for a decent fidget object, except for that oxidized metal smell.", "It\u2019s the same principle as deposit cans/bottles, probably. For some people it\u2019s not worth the effort, but someone else is happy to do the work for the (small amount of) cash. \n\nFor the record, I always return my cart. Otherwise I won\u2019t have my car coin.", "nice work", "I mean, yeah, they will give you a quarter (4 in fact!) in exchange for a dollar. They do not just give quarters or carts. Know this for a fact because we literally forgot our quarter 2 days ago.", "Most stores have a cart corral in the parking lot where they hope customers will push their carts, and their employees go out every so often to collect them.\n\nBut some people just abandon them in the parking lot, too lazy to walk 50 or so feet to put the cart in a convenient place.", "Like she said, they were making eye contact as she approached with the cart and walking toward her. I\u2019m guessing they probably also started to reach for the cart when she got close enough.", "They do at some stores. My Aldi will give you a quarter if you ask, but I can see some not doing that.", "You get to decide when to be generous, no-one else gets to decide that for you."]}
