Eli and I don\u2019t live together at the moment as we\u2019re in the search for a house, we both live within our parents\u2019 home. Each of us have a good relationship with each other\u2019s parents and our parents are polite and respectful to one another so all in all, no bad blood between any involved parties. \n\nEli\u2019s parents have only seen Harry twice since his birth which was via emergency c section. Once in the hospital, once during the holidays when I brought him over to their house for maybe an hour and a half. Eli\u2019s parents have yet to come to my home to see the baby themselves despite it only being a 10 minute drive across town. They have no car problems, no health issues, nothing keeping them from coming here on their own time. \n\nI held out the olive branch by bringing Harry over the first time since they were so adamant on not coming to my home (difference in faith/holiday celebration), yet since then they haven\u2019t made the effort of coming to visit their grandson. It\u2019s been over a month and now they\u2019re starting to ask about seeing Harry again and I\u2019m holding my ground in saying that I won\u2019t be catering to them every time they want to see him because of how long it takes to get ourselves ready to go anywhere, and because it\u2019s not right that I have to go charter the baby around at their beck and call when they can easily come here instead. I just won\u2019t make the extra effort if they make none themselves. Simple. \n\nEli has already spoken to them on the matter but they refuse to change their minds. I\u2019m being called the AH for not letting them see Harry in the comfort of their home. \n\nTL;DR - My in-laws want the see my son, but only within their home despite no problems between our families. It takes too long for me to always be the one bringing him over, and I refuse to be the only one putting in any effort simply for the sake of their comfort. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: His parents smoke within the home, but clean it regularly and make sure the immediate area of the home is smoke free. The previous time I took Harry over they had aired out the house for 2 days and it smelled completely fine, they didn\u2019t touch cigarettes around him and everyone was happy. Additionally I didn\u2019t include in the original post because it\u2019s not my main concern since we sorted that issue out before. The main problem is their expectancy of having me always bring the baby to them instead of reciprocating and taking turns to visit.", "created_utc": 1674657733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l06lv/aita_for_refusing_to_bring_my_son_to_my_inlaws/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think everyone voting ESH and NAH hasn\u2019t had to car an infant around.  It is a pain in the a** and given that the in laws have no reason not to drive the 10 minutes, they are totally ridiculous. Getting all your stuff together for the baby takes longer than their entire drive.", "NTA but I hope you didn\u2019t actually say all those things listed in your OP. You can make it super simple for them: \u201cYes, happy to have you and Harry visit! You\u2019re invited over tomorrow at X time\u201d and if they say please bring him here, \u201cOh my, not sure of Harry\u2019s nap schedule. Newborns you know? Hope you can make it!\u201d\n\nAlso, you\u2019re 8 weeks post-op from a c-section. You\u2019re probably only recently cleared to drive. I would have milked that excuse for awhile.", "NTA. Packing up everything you need and schlepping your infant to and fro is incredibly labour intensive, not to mention time consuming. Also, am I reading this right? Is there a religious/cultural component as to why they don't wanna come to you?", "NTA. I have a son a similar age and getting in the car to go anywhere with him is a massive pain in the neck. If your in-laws want to see their grandson, they will make it happen. My parents are always over and they\u2019re 30 minutes away. \nI don\u2019t think you should cater to anyone else\u2019s needs when you have a newborn to consider", "NTA. To me right now you are setting the boundaries that will follow you and your son for the next 18 years. If they can\u2019t be bothered to come once then oh well for them.", "NTA\n\nIf they want to see the kid, they can cooperate.\n\nYou are taking care of an infant, you don't have time to coddle or cater to their demands", "NTA\n\nThis sounds like Eli's problem to deal with.", "Most grandparents are so eager to see their grandchildren that you have to set boundaries to keep them away! It's so strange that Eli's parents won't come to see Harry where you live . . . sounds like a power play.\n\nAnyway, you're NTA. I'm curious to see if Eli's parents continue this behavior once you and Eli find a place of your own.", "Info: how often has Eli seen his son? Does he only see his son at your house?", "NTA.  You had a c section which is a long healing process and the baby is only a couple months old which means you have to bring everything the baby needs in order to go have a visit with them.  Not to mention adjusting to caring for a baby 24/7 is EXHAUSTING.  I didn't want to take any of my babies out either.  You're not barring the grandparents from seeing the child just setting the boundary that you're not going to be the one always packing up and traveling there.", "NTA. \n\n1. If they want to see their grandson, they can make the 10-minute drive unencumbered by infants and all the accoutrement infants require. \n2. Additionally, their son - who is the father of the child - can come to your house, pack up all the needfuls, and take the baby to his parents' home and bring him back after the visit. \n\nThese are two perfectly valid options, and they can choose which one they'd prefer. Perhaps even alternating between #1, #2, and #3 where you take Harry to their house every 3rd visit. But it absolutely should not be 100% on you to do all the work for every visit.", "NTA. You are the parent who seems to be carrying the vast majority of the workload\u2026what they are demanding is an unreasonable imposition especially as it\u2019s only basis is religious bigotry- which abhorrent as that is, it\u2019s also irrelevant outside of the holidays they object to.\n\nI mean, if there was some sort of reciprocity in the visiting, going over there is probably only in the range of inconvenient and tiring, but when the subtext is that they expect you to not only comply with their demand to jump, they expect you to ask \u2018how high\u2019\u2026this is a cycle that you right to resist.", "NTA and I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re getting e s h votes. You had an emergency c section only two months ago! And now they refuse to visit you and the little one for some bs reasons? \nThem coming over doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re getting forced to change their views or suddenly celebrate any holidays, but to visit their grandson. \nStand your ground, because they\u2019re behaving absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA and don't bring your infant over to a home where people smoke. Period. It's never going to be smoke free.", "NTA, tbh they are incredibly selfish. I have a five week old baby and just being able to go to the local corner shop for bread takes 30-40mins to get baby changed, fed, in her pramsuit, pram and let's not forget me sorted just to pop down the road for five minutes. \n\nIf they are that desperate and cared that much they would move heaven and earth to meet you at your home.", "So if I'm reading this correctly:\n\nIt takes multiple days of prep for their house to be clean 'enough' for a baby visit. \n\nBut they smoke in their house so even clean is less than ideal.\n\nYou and the babies father both agree that you aren't really fans of you taking the baby over there, even if it's where Dad lives. \n\nYou are more than willing to host the grandparents and even offered meals/snacks/etc to make them comfortable while they do.\n\nYea. That sounds like a list of 'them problems'/a power play to me. If your SO *wanted* to take the baby over occasionally, id maybe judge this differently, but asbit stands NTA. The only people preventing them from seeing their grandson is themselves.", "NTA a 2-month-old is not easy to transport unnecessarily, especially if it is currently winter in your hemisphere.", "This is tough but I going with NTA. It seems kinda crazy that they cant make the way to you if you are the one that has to do all the carting around.", "NTA. You took him over last time, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable that you ask them to take turns and come to your house if they want to see their grandson. Then maybe the time after you could go to their house. Speaking from experience, in-laws can get entitled and demanding very easily, so it\u2019s good to establish those boundaries now and not always cave to their demands. If they truly cared about Harry they wouldn\u2019t make this their hill to die on.", "NTA.  These people are ridiculous. When he\u2019s older and in sports, I bet the never come to his games.", "Nta. I have the same problem. Drunk call begging to let mil be involved with our child (never said she couldn't) yet now 5 years in WE have to call so they can spend time together. \n\nDon't waste time making space for them if they are not willing to put in the effort.", "NTA.  Nope, because this is necessary for baby's well-being and best development.  *Everyone else is less important than baby.*\n\nLikewise, it's just plain odd they refuse.  They haven't given a reason, and I assume there's no rational basis for one.  Most of the time, when grandparents do this it's because seeing baby in baby's home, surrounded by parents and other extended family causes the objecting grandparents anxiety that they aren't front and center and cannot dominate and control anyone.  If so, it's best they get over those feelings asap.", "NTA.\n\n\"We want to see our grandchild!\"\n\n\"OK, come on over.\"\n\n\"Well, we don't want to see him that much...\"\n\nThey have the opportunity, they just don't care enough to do it. That's their problem.", "NTA. You are not refusing to let them see their grandson, you've made clear that they're welcome to visit. They don't get to prioritize their own comfort and expect you to cater to that, especially when it's so much more of a hassle for you to pack up the baby and cart him over there than it is for them to get in their car and drive the 10 minutes to your house. Hold your ground, you haven't taken anything away from them and giving in will likely set a precedent that will be very annoying for you in the future.", "NTA\n\nWhy are they calling you an asshole and not their son? Why can't he bring your son to visit if it's so important?\n\nObviously I don't think you should bring him if you don't want to and it puts you out (and a baby that age to might not want him away from you for now) but you need to stop letting them make this your problem. There are three grown adults ahead who can solve it. Leave it to them.", "NTA. Getting in the car with a young child is a much more stressful ordeal than getting two adults in the car. If they want to see him they can get in the car to see him, you are not obligated to make your child available to them where they want. If it\u2019s important to them they\u2019ll make it work. \n\nOne of my coworkers and his wife stop by each of their kids houses during the holidays because they know traveling with kids is difficult and don\u2019t want their children to have to cart their kids around when it\u2019s easier for them to just drop by everyone\u2019s house instead.", "At that age if people wanted to see my son - they primarily came to us because they know it's easier for multiple reasons. They can't complain about not seeing grandchild if they have the option and choose not to. They aren't compromising, and currently, neither are you. NAH but it is unfortunate for Harry and hopefully it gets better", "NTA- if they want to see their grandson they can come to you. You've recovering from major surgery AND are taking care of a baby full time. It shouldn't be on you to go and visit them", "NTA, sounds like the in-laws are a bit entitled and need to be put in their proper place.", "NTA\n\nlogistics of packing up a baby >>> able bodied adults driving 10 minutes. your in-laws are being ridiculous and entitled.", "Nta\n\nPacking up and moving a baby is an entire production, it's completely understandable not to want to do that everytime you're going to see people.", "NTA. Never bring a child to a smoker\u2019s house. Doesn\u2019t \nmatter that they \u201cclean\u201d beforehand.", "Whilst you are NTA, is this a hill worth dying on", "NTA \n\nThis is ridiculous of them. Who wants to lug a newborn around rather it's always or once in a while. It's difficult getting out of the house with a newborn and all their supplies. If they want to see him so badly, they can come to you. Hopefully you and Eli stay on the same page with this.", "NTA, as you are not at the beck and call of these people.  That said, they aren't even your in-laws, are they?   I note you said SO, not  husband.  Words have meaning.   If you do things in the wrong order, you are going to get the wrong result.  You've had a mixed-faith child before marriage, so you can expect there will be a lot of conflict about raising the child between the grandparents, however.  These folks in particular don't seem very welcoming and are entitled.  Unless you live in some shrine to a bizarre religion, they are being ridiculous in not coming to see this child.  Do not bend over backwards for them, as they will treat you how you allow yourself to be treated.", "INFO: How come Eli doesn't parent the baby some nights and weekends? Surely the baby has been seen by his father or cared for alone by his father? Are you baby care 24/7? Has Eli never done midnight feedings or cared for Harry to give you time alone??", "NTA - Your story implies you're also making Eli do all the traveling and compromising, too, when he's the father. He lives with his parents and when you say you've taken the baby once to his parents house, you're saying you've taken the baby once to see him, too. At some point there should be shared responsibilities with Eli, at Eli's place, in which his parents get to see the child. However the baby is only 2 months old and you can't be faulted for being protective of your child in your own home.", "ESH \n\n>Each of us have a good relationship with each other\u2019s parents and our parents are polite and respectful to one another so all in all, no bad blood between any involved parties. \n\nIs this your definition of polite and respectful? Sounds like neither.", "Your living situation makes it sound like the OP title could be \"..refusing to bring my son to his father's house\"\n\nYou not catering to them by bringing the kid over whenever requested is different than a rule that they must come to your house.\n\n2 month post-partum mom sounding a little weird = NAH.", "NTA\n\nI absolutely think that they should just come over to see their grandson and stop complaining.\nWhy should you make the effort every time, when not only do they want something from you, namely to see your child, but they are probably way more mobile than you, as they don\u2018t have a baby to get ready etc.\n\nBUT, to choose this hill to die on after only bringing him over there once is an AH move as well.\nI have an almost two month old and a 2 year old, and yes, it\u2018s way easier to go out without children, but it\u2019s not that bad.\nPlus with them living only 10mins away it\u2018s not like you have to prepare for a long car ride and be 100% sure you have everything you could possible need. If you forget something important someone can just go get it or you cut the visit short. With the distance between you it\u2018s not like every visit needs to be special bc they\u2019re few and far between.\n\nAnd what about your SO? Does he only see his son at your place?\n\nEDIT\n\nChanged my vote, based on the additional info that the grandparents smoke inside their house, which completely changes things!\n\nAlso the fact that your car isn\u2019t ideal to transport a child is another reason for them to visit you, but the smoking is the deciding factor imo", "Info: Is there a reason why Eli cannot take the baby to his parents house one evening?", "There seems to be more going on. You guys still living with your parents, and not with each other as a family? The child is 2 months old, and you are house hunting now?? What happened during the pregnancy?", "This is very quite simple.

Not to mention Eli\u2019s parents smoke within the home so it takes a couple days of prep for things to be relatively okay enough for a short visit. Also, Eli doesn\u2019t like having baby out on the road unless absolutely necessary because we have small cars and it\u2019s a risk that doesn\u2019t need to be taken.", "They aren\u2019t Jewish. We (In-laws, Eli, and myself) follow the laws of Noah to be righteous Gentiles but have not completed the conversion process. My parents are catholic but don\u2019t really talk about religion and have always told me to follow whatever belief I want. They are respectful of our beliefs and don\u2019t make it a conversation point at any turn.", "After 7 years in a relationship and multiple outings with both families all together, this is the first real problem that\u2019s surfaced between us. While our parents may not have been super chummy with one another, everyone has been very respectful and friendly. The in-laws even got to meet my extended family of aunts and uncles during the baby shower and everyone was having a good time. Not sure how much more peaceful it can get.", "Harry is just over 2mo old. The only way he would suffer is if Mom is stressed because at that age Mom = whole world. He\u2019s not missing anything and the grandparents are being unreasonable. It is much, much harder to tote around a baby and all the stuff they need, than it is for perfectly healthy grandparents to make the ten minute drive over. \n\nNTA.", "No way would I take my newborn to an indoor smokers house.", "My parents have invited them over personally so they wouldn\u2019t be forcing themselves in. And I don\u2019t mind hauling my son and his things around, I just mind being the only one making the effort in this scenario so that they can see him.", "What a trash take.", "If they want a decent relationship they have to get over their bigotry and go see their grandchild.", "I made an edit stating that they smoke within the home. It takes a while to clean properly before both of us are okay with Harry going over. He is also exclusively breastfed and hasn\u2019t been taking bottles so in order for baby to be fed and happy, I would have to go with them. I am absolutely grateful that my son has both sets of grandparents that care for him, I just don\u2019t appreciate being the only one having to drive across town so that they can see him. If it were us taking turns or even them making an effort at least on a monthly basis to come see him I\u2019d be more than happy to take Harry over. But they expect me to be the only one doing the work while they sit home and wait for me to deliver.", "This. I'm a new grandma, and I have her 3 days a week, and I absolutely \ud83d\udcaf FORGOT how hard all of that was. I even asked myself how I used to do it with 2! Because memories absolutely can fade for how difficult things we don't do anymore have changed. My in-laws were awesome. They came to us a LOT and went out of their way to make things as easy as possible for us when the kids were small. NTA op. At all.", "Well if they aren\u2019t accepting your invitations, they don\u2019t have a legitimate complaint \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.   stand your ground on this.  Also - WTF - they should be bringing food and treats to YOU and doing anything they can to make your live a little easier right now.    If they can\u2019t be bothered to drive twenty minutes round trip to see their grandchild that\u2019s completely on them - move forward with no guilt at all", "Stand your ground. To not even enter the home of someone of a differing faith is just bizarre. Plus, I see they are indoor smokers so it's perhaps best the baby doesn't spend too much time there till he's older.", "So they\u2019re bigots? They can\u2019t enter a home because of holiday decorations? Keep the kid away as much as possible.", "Aw look, u/ApartmentPrevious646 is a weird comment bot! Stolen from u/newbeginingshey\u2019s comment", "Does he never take the baby? It's just always you, even though y'all are together?", "If I'm going anywhere, that's further than 5 minutes. I need a minimum of an hour prep so I can pack the car and the nappy bag!!", "Because his parents expect more than just a half hour. They\u2019re not willing to compromise on this and it\u2019s frustrating. I would be forced to go myself to make them happy and keep baby fed and happy.", "Baby was unplanned and we are not financially ready to move out on our own. If we did, it would have to be to bad neighborhoods and we\u2019d be doing so while struggling. Not an ideal situation. We\u2019re taking the time to get our savings up and find a good area to move into so that we\u2019re not forced to move multiple times in the coming year.", "Oof, NTA for keeping the baby out of that house. Is your partner able to keep some clean, smoke-free clothes at your parents\u2019 place to change into? Maybe take a quick shower too? He will have third-hand smoke on him if they smoke indoors.", "This needs to be in the main post! Holy shit don't bring your baby to a smoker's house!", "Well that changes things.\nI can totally understand not wanting to bring your child into a household where they smoke inside! I wouldn\u2019t want to go there without children, let alone with them!", "It is hard to rotate a baby around. I have twins so I get it. I\u2019m talking if this behavior by mom and grandparents continues. They need to sort it out now.", "No he doesn\u2019t take the baby, his parents smoke within the home and it takes a couple days of cleaning/airing it out before it\u2019s to an acceptable standard for both of us to allow him over. Additionally, I\u2019m exclusively breastfeeding and Harry doesn\u2019t take to bottles yet so it\u2019d be a rough time for him.", "I truly dont understand these people. Their behaviour is utterly bizarre and it's annoying me two people can be so difficult for no reason that makes any kind of sense. You are definitely NTA here and doing well to stay sane with these people in your lives", "But why can't he just come stay with you?", "I live with my parents and they aren\u2019t okay with that. They want us to have a place of our own and are willing to let Eli come over whenever for as long as we need to find a good home and neighborhood but aren\u2019t willing to have him move-in in fear that it will cause the house hunting to become stagnant and cease altogether because we become comfortable."]}
