He's genuinely a nice guy - he's funny and helpful, and I'm glad to have him on the team. However, ever since Ryan started here he's made many many many sexist jokes towards me. Multiple times a shift, every shift. \"Get to sweeping, woman\", \"you should be cleaning the kitchen, that's women's work\", \"all women are hoes\", etc. But he has also stated many times that he's just trying to annoy me, and that he's moreso making fun of sexism rather than actually being sexist - and I do believe him. I don't think he truly holds any of those beliefs.\n\nLast week, he made another comment about me cleaning, and I was already annoyed that day, so I just replied and told him that he really should cut that out. He again replied that I know he's just joking. I said okay, what's the joke? He said to make fun of sexist comments. I said he shouldn't do that by being sexist. Blah blah blah. He hasn't made any more comments like that toward me since, which I'm really thankful for. But I can't help but feel bad. I know that he wasn't trying to ACTUALLY be sexist towards me, but the jokes still bother me. I just think it's kinda uncomfortable to joke about it that much, you know? It's not just me that's told him to knock it off, other female team members have told him to stop too - but he didn't until I spoke to him. I feel justified because it wasn't only bothering me, but also guilty because those jokes can be kinda funny sometimes. It's just how constant it is. I don't know.
