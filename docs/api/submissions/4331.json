I\u2019m not sorry, but like it would be good to know because the rest of my family thinks this went too far.\n\nMy (24F) mom died when I was 7 from leukemia. I have very few memories of her from before she was sick and I didn\u2019t get to spend a lot of time with her in her last year but she was an artist and until she couldn\u2019t anymore she would make me little collages when she was in the hospital with drawings and photos and messages for me. My grandmother put them all in a book for me after she died.  I wanted to be like my mom and my counselor thought it would help, so I started a journal where I would do kind of a similar thing and I\u2019ve done at least one page a week all these years ever since my mom died, more when I miss her or have something hard going on. So, I have kind of a unique record of my mental state over the last 16 years.\n\nMy father remarried when I was 9.  My step-mother really leaned hard into the \u201cI\u2019m your mom now\u201d and my father didn\u2019t stop her.  It improved when they had my half-brother because she basically forgot about me then. Unfortunately he got cancer when he was 3. And I pretty much ceased to exist for my father, he was either working or gone with my brother and I spent all my teen years mostly at home alone or with my grandparents. The mantra was that my brother needed to be the focus because he might die so I needed to not be selfish since I was healthy. I stopped trying to talk to him when I was 16 and it was a dark time.  I moved out when I was 18 and cut them off completely.\n\nMy grandparents let me know that my brother died a couple of years ago but respected my desire to remain NC with my father. He recently reached out to them because he wants to see me and talk.  I went through my old journals and made him a PowerPoint with images of the entries where I had talked about being frustrated and feeling abandoned and unwanted, some with literal quotes of things my dad had said to me during arguments. Even the really dark stuff from when I was seriously depressed. Then I ended it with a photo of one of my mom\u2019s collages where she had written \u201cRemember that your dad and I are always here for you\u201d and I wrote \u201cYou failed. Go away.\u201d underneath. I felt like him being able to see it from my literal perspective would communicate why I don\u2019t want him back better than I could.\n\nEvidently it worked, but a little too well because I\u2019ve been bombarded by family telling me that it\u2019s understandable that I don\u2019t want to see him, but what I sent gutted him and he\u2019s completely fallen apart after reading through it and it was unnecessarily cruel.\n\nMaybe it was, I know my bar for that is kind of weird sometimes, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1670605246, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zh2g3s/aita_for_responding_to_my_fathers_request_for_a/", "score": 826, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father *did* fail you repeatedly, even before your brother got sick. He should never have married a woman who tried to push out the memory of your mom. And he should never have tolerated you being \"forgotten about\" as soon as your half-brother was born. Your brother's illness and passing were a tragedy and your dad and stepmom could perhaps be forgiven for a \"doing their best but fell short\" type of parenting. But they clearly didn't even reach that level.\n\nPeople will convince themselves of all kinds of delusions about why a close relationship went bad. You destroyed any such delusions your father had and spoke your truth. If he wants to have any hope of repairing his relationship with you, that can't happen until he honestly faces what he did to you. (I am not saying that to push you into repairing your relationship with him -- that's your call to make. Just that *IF* it were to happen, that would be an important element.) He could start by calling off the family members who are hassling you.", "NTA in the slightest. You told your dad how you felt and it made him have to confront his failures as a parent. It is not your fault he neglected you. He is upset because he knows what you put in the PowerPoint is the reality of how he treated you when you were just a child. Now that the truth is out and you have reestablished NC, I hope you are able to let go of some of the anger you have at him and know that you did nothing to cause how he treated you. I\u2019m no contact with my dad and have been able to find a lot of peace in the life I have built without him. I hope for the same for you.", "NTA at all. That was a reality check what he had done to you. And he didn\u2019t like it. And your enabling family neither. The presentation forced them to look in the mirror.

Yea that probably sucks, buy maybe he should have been a better dad.", "NTA. Own it. Don't be sorry. He fell apart because was bombarded with all the feelings that he would've noticed had he paid you any attention, he brought it upon himself.", "NTA- and I would say.  It was honest. It was meant to be honest. If it was cruel, it was only because he now knows what he has done. The point was not to hurt him, but to help him understand. Now he does.", "Holy shit. NTA but that was brutal. I pictured the \"You Failed\" popping up at the end like when you die in Dark Souls.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t get to wash everything away because some time has passed and he wants a relationship now. Especially if he had made no effort to fix or atone for said behavior.", "NTA\n\nIf he didn't want to hear the answer, he shouldn't have asked. You responded unequivocally and with receipts, no further discussion needed.\n\nTell your family that if he's struggling with the consequences of his own actions, they should pay for his therapy. It is 100% not your problem.\n\nWell done, you.", ">Evidently it worked, but a little too well because I\u2019ve been bombarded by family telling me that it\u2019s understandable that I don\u2019t want to see him, but what I sent gutted him and he\u2019s completely fallen apart after reading through it and it was unnecessarily cruel.\n\nIt was unnecessarily cruel of him to completely abandon/ignore you when your half-brother got sick. You already lost your mom, you would lose your brother, too, but he didn't think you needed any support or help? \n\n**NTA.**", "NTA, you just lifted the fog of the fantasy he was telling himself, truth can be harsh but  he shouldn't live in a fantasy where he is the victim.", "NTA.  Was it harsh?  Yeah.  Was it a lot of effort when simply have telling him \u201cgo away\u201d would have accomplished the basic goal?  Probably.  But this was your lived reality, and he wasn\u2019t interested in hearing or helping you when it would actually have made a difference.  If it\u2019s only now dawning on him how lonely and rejected you must have felt, he\u2019s just going to have to live with that.  (Also, one does have to question whether he\u2019d be this gutted or even reaching out at all if your brother were still here.)", "NTA. You found an effective way to communicate just how badly your father effed up. He is lucky it was only a PP presentation and not years of misery.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think he meant any harm when you grew up, possibly he was so worried about his son because he lost his previous wife to cancer as well. But he still left you, you felt like you were abandoned and went NC now he wants to try and repair your relationship but it is too late for that, and if you don\u2019t want to you have every right to ignore him. Was the PowerPoint a little harsh, yes, but he had it coming. You don\u2019t own him a relationship and you don\u2019t owe him kindness. He should recognize how his behavior hurt you and not hold your resentment against you. Tell your family that you don\u2019t owe him an apology. I hope things will go well for you OP.", "NTA. You simply held a mirror to his face. It\u2019s not your fault he didn\u2019t like what he saw. He SHOULD be gutted.", "NTA at all.  How dare your \u201cfamily\u201d expect you to sugar coat your feelings for your awful awful father.  How. Dare. They.\n\nREAL family would apologize to you for letting you suffer in silence and not being there to help you, a child yourself, with the things you needed to grow up emotionally healthy.  REAL family would ask how they can help you now.  Real family wouldn\u2019t minimize the problems because they are inconvenient for their narrative.  These people want to play happy family and pretend everything is not as bad as it is.  This situation is exactly karma for your dad\u2019s absolute failure as a father.  He brought this on himself. \n\nI am soooo angry for you.  They don\u2019t get to decide what is necessary and unnecessary for you.  Don\u2019t you dare let them talk you out of what you feel because they don\u2019t like how it makes them feel or look.  Your power point didn\u2019t \u201cwork too well\u201d, it worked.  Period.  I\u2019m proud of you for finally getting to say things in a way that got your point across. Now go be awesome on your own. You don\u2019t owe them a lift up after they let you down.  And please don\u2019t listen when they tell you to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d.  It just means eat their abuse.\n\nI think you need to face the reality that you have better coping mechanisms and understanding of what it means to be a functional adult than your father and family.  They may be older, but they are not wiser.\n\nYou are adult and you get to decide what that means.  You get to decide what works for you.  I\u2019m so sorry this was your childhood reality.  I hope you continue to do your art therapy, and make up for your neglect with a great life.  NTA. At all.", "NTA. What you did is savage, for sure, but you're not *the* asshole because your father is.\n\nSure, it would have been more tactful to say \"No I don't want to talk to him,\" but the whole point, *as you showed through evidence*, is his treatment of you during your formative years means he is not deserving of your tact.", "NTA\n\nYour dad asked for a relationship with you. This is the relationship he built with you. This is the reality of how that looks. He's asking you to ignore all previous evidence that he'll disappoint you and put yourself in the vulnerable position of depending on him emotionally again. You can't do that to yourself again. Any relationship you have going forward has to be based on the reality of the past and for your part, that means protecting yourself from being abandoned again. \n\n  \nI (51F) have contact with my mom, but because I never tell her how I really feel about how she has always treated me and how she treated dad when he was dying, we don't have a relationship, not really, and because she's always been incapable of being wrong, we never will. I only refrain from NC for the sake of seeing my brothers every year at xmas. I don't expect her to stop being a selfish jerk and therefore I'm never disappointed. \n\n If you acquiesced to his demand that you be his loving daughter without saying how you really feel, you wouldn't be giving him a relationship anyway.", "Not the asshole.\n\nI had a horrendous relationship with my father. Really horrendous. Many years later, when it was too late I was given a different perspective from the kids of his long time girlfriend. There was a lot of behind the scenes shit I wasn't aware of and after his funeral the reality of his life was laid before me.\n\nI was the asshole and I didn't get to go back. Not all relationships can or should be saved. But the loss of a wife and a person who knows how to abuse that hole can fuck people who you wouldn't expect someone to be able to manipulate. \n\nIt's worth hearing him out, but it's critical your feelings and experiences are made clear to him.", "NTA.  You're allowed to feel and think the way that you do. \n\nWas your presentation harsh? Yes. Was it over the top? A little. Did it get your point across? Definitely.\n\nMaybe your father has massive regrets since you are now his only remaining biological child and perhaps he's feeling the weight of that. Maybe he's now realizing that not all actions are forgivable.  That's on him though.\n\nYou do what works for you.", "NTA. You're the GOAT!!!\n\nHis and stepmother's behavior was extreme! Having 1 sick child doesn't cause other children to cease to exist. Demanding that you shrink yourself and neglect/belittle your wants/needs/experiences because you were healthy is beyond cruel and toxic.\n\nYou gave him 10 minutes to learn how you felt about his neglect and cruelty. He's had, what, a week or two of feeling the hopelessness and supposedly suffering. You've had at least 12-15 years of suffering??? \n\nThat's what I would text back to every person who has criticized you: you suffered depression, neglect, and cruelty for 10-12 years. You're father hasn't suffered those things, he inflicted them. He's is experiencing the consequences of his actions, and it's only been 2 weeks. The fact is you did not make that PowerPoint to cause pain, you made it to explain why you feel the way you do, and that you don't want anything to do with him, ever. Then ask those people if they ever held him to account for him abdication of parental responsibility and insist he straighten up. \n\nUnless they confronted him during that time period he abandoned you, they don't have a duck in the hunt and need to bury their heads in the sand just as they did back then.\n\nYour mom sounds like she was amazing. Your weekly collection of collages sounds awesome and I'd definitely buy a big glossy book from a person who showed them off and told the stories of that period of time. So, that means you're awesome. Which is why you're the GOAT.\n\nKeep being rad.\n\nBtw, I finally went no contact with my narcissistic mother when I was 40.", "NTA.\nHe failed you and he failed your mom because of the way he treated you. Where was the families sympathy when you were suffering ? You gave him excerpts of how you felt for YEARS.\nI hope you managed to heal and focus on your happiness for the last few years.", "NTA - reality hit him in the face. He\u2019s lost a spouse, a son, and now a daughter. He had complete control over losing 1 of them and refused to help in the moment.", "NTA. Who are all these family members who feel like they have a say in any of this? Were they there to tell dad he was wrong when he was neglecting his own child? Why do they feel the need to give their opinion now?", "NTA if he wanted a relationship he should have been better, he\u2019s just now realizing how much of an A H he has been and is trying to make up for it, for his benefit of not feeling bad. Keep it NC and block him on everything and tell your family that you don\u2019t want a relationship with him just because he doesn\u2019t want to live with regrets. He made his bed he can lie in it.", "NTA. The truth can often be quite brutal. If he never heard it, how could he possibly understand the damage he had done? How could he improve so as not to ever repeat the same mistakes with others? You were a child and he failed you. That truth is not open to debate. Now he bears the consequences to his choices.\n\nI'm so sorry for everyone involved here. Your dad was in an unbelievably heartwrenching position. He traumatized and neglected you as a result. I'm sorry that you were ignored and left to mourn your mom with no support. I'm sorry that your mental health was undervalued. But that was wrong of him. You have every right to be unable to forgive those years of trauma. Honestly communicating those sentiments is part of your healing process. NTA", "NTA. First you weren't a priority because there was a baby. Then you weren't a priority because your brother was sick. Then you weren't a priority because your father was mourning your brother. You became accustomed to not having him as a father a long time ago. Your whole relationship has been about him as a parent and not about you as a child. You expressed your feelings in the way that worked best for you, and that was your right. You didn't yell or scream. Note that the family is basically saying he's hurt, not angry. He's hurt because you spoke to him in a way that he couldn't deny or disregard and he knows it's all true. Maybe he wants to make amends. In this instance, maybe the best way for him to make amends is to leave the person he's harmed alone.", "NTA", "NTA the truth hurts", "NTA , it was harsh but also specific, so way better than just \u201cgo away\u201d.", "NTA\n\nThat's was brilliant and really helped him see from your perspective how badly he failed you.

If you had shared those feelings and words with him verbally and in person, he probably wouldn\u2019t have grasped the full impact of what you went through as a child.  \n\nHonestly, these family members who are telling you that it was cruel and unnecessary, need to stay out of it.  I bet they are the type of \u201cfamily\u201d that didn\u2019t show you the same type of concern when you were a child and were being neglected.  \n\nYou were a victim. You don\u2019t need to be the bigger person and forgive your father or show him mercy. You don\u2019t owe him anything.", "NTA \n\nHe gets to fail as a father and a decent human being for years, but you make one powerpoint and suddenly you're out of line? nuh-uh. He deserved to see exactly the pain he put you through", "NTA\n\nJust block those family members and move on with your life\n\nYour dad dug this hole, now he has to live in it", "NTA, bet he wouldn't be reaching out now if his son was still around", "NTA the bridge was already nuked. You just showed him the pictures of the aftermath.", "Nta please get therapy n live ur best life bc ur mom would want so", "NTA", "NTA, I love this.", "NTA.

Too bad it's too late.", "NTA.\n\nHe emotionally abused you for years and now he's reaping what he sowed.", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t say you went too far, but it was a brutally honest reminder of why you went NC and I\u2019m not shocked he\u2019s having a hard time with it. That\u2019s not your fault nor your problem though.", "NTA. He NEEDED to see that and you needed to show him what he did to you. I would have been worse", "NTA. I'm guessing you sent it to him and didn't stand in front of him and do a full presentation, meaning he didn't even have to suffer the shame of looking you in the eyes.

You don't need that in your life.", "NTA", "NTA and a very intelligent decision maker. Communicating with words alone would have given him an avenues to argue, justify, and try to explain himself. Utilising your artistry to communicate succeeded in both clearly articulating your own feelings & perspective, and closing down those avenues for him. \n\nYour family are wrong, your actions were not cruel; they were extremely effective as your father is now being forced to reckon with the long term consequences of his choices. Insulating him further by not being honest about your feelings would have done both of you a disservice as there's no guarantee he'd back off after a simple 'I do not wish for a relationship with you, please leave me alone\", and you clearly already derive nothing positive or constructive from communicating with him. \n\nI respect your strength of character and wish you the best OP, and I hope your family members take some time for introspection here.

I have very few memories of her from before she was sick and I didn\u2019t get to spend a lot of time with her in her last year but she was an artist and until she couldn\u2019t anymore she would make me little collages when she was in the hospital with drawings and photos and messages for me.

I wanted to be like my mom and my counselor thought it would help, so I started a journal where I would do kind of a similar thing and I\u2019ve done at least one page a week all these years ever since my mom died, more when I miss her or have something hard going on. So, I have kind of a unique record of my mental state over the last 16 years.\n\nMy father remarried when I was 9.  My step-mother really leaned hard into the \u201cI\u2019m your mom now\u201d and my father didn\u2019t stop her.  It improved when they had my half-brother because she basically forgot about me then.

I moved out when I was 18 and cut them off completely.\n\nMy grandparents let me know that my brother died a couple of years ago but respected my desire to remain NC with my father. He recently reached out to them because he wants to see me and talk.  I went through my old journals and made him a PowerPoint with images of the entries where I had talked about being frustrated and feeling abandoned and unwanted, some with literal quotes of things my dad had said to me during arguments. Even the really dark stuff from when I was seriously depressed. Then I ended it with a photo of one of my mom\u2019s collages where she had written \u201cRemember that your dad and I are always here for you\u201d and I wrote \u201cYou failed. Go away.\u201d underneath.

It's not pretty. You were only showing him what you felt all those years. I get that he had to handle the situation with his dying child, but that's no excuse to forget he had an entire other child.

What you did was present absolute proof of events and you feelings from those exact moments from those times. He couldn't dismiss it and say it never happened. He has to face what he did.

Now he has proof and has to face to reality. Your dad was in a tough spot too, but it was his responsibility to manage. You were still a kid that lost their mother and you still needed his support. He did indeed fail you! It was probably very hard for him to hear, but if he was pushing you for a relationship, he probably needed to hear it.", "Yeah, the shitty thing is I actually loved my brother a lot, he was always a sweet kid even when he was sick. Even if my step-mom sucked I kind of liked being his big sister and missing out on time with him is the only thing I really regret about leaving.  I always kind of hoped he would get better and we could reconnect when he was older.", "Also it\u2019s important to make a victim impact statement in order to process your grief.", "I\u2019m with you.  Jesus, his wife died, his toddler is dying. He\u2019s doing everything he can to stay employed and keep them feed and a roof over their head AND keep the marriage going.  I\u2019m thinking maybe we cut the guy some slack.", "Agreed. All you had to say was no. Maybe if he wouldn't accept no as an answer, then go nuclear. You went hard from the get go.", "why should she give him a chance to apologize? what her dad did isn\u2019t a \u201cmistake.\u201d he made the decision to push her aside for her brother. he had YEARS to fix it. her dad should feel bad and he deserves it.", "So choosing to treat her badly doesn\u2019t make him an asshole, but her showing him how he chose to treat her makes her an asshole? Please explain.", "Why?  Why should he be shielded from the consequences of his actions?", "It\u2019s honest. Honestly, she did it in the kindest way possible.", "You should say Esh at least", "[removed]", "NTA The reality hurts", "In my experience with Narcissist's that doesn't resinate the same way. Which is why i started saying it the other way, doesn't stop them from trying to gaslight the situation \"It didn't happen that way, etc\" so when you show proof and tell them their conduct is the problem not the truth it helps take the wind out of their sails. Its not a sure fire thing with Narcs but it really helps deflate them.", "Exactly! Considering that the family thought that the father getting confronted with what he did is what's cruel, not what he actually did; I have a feeling that a simple \"no\" or \"go away\" wouldn't have been enough for them anyways. They clearly don't side with the OP.", "Amen. People won\u2019t take no for an answer. I\u2019ve gone NC with my father as well and I wish I had the guts to take a similar approach rather than spend months receiving messages saying how what he did \u201cwasn\u2019t that bad\u201d and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand\u201d and he\u2019s \u201csaid sorry a million times\u201d and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know where he went wrong,\u201d etc. After blocking him, he even went through loop holes, adding me to group chats in messenger to get around the blocking, mailed me things and so on. After all this time, it\u2019s still about how everything makes *him* feel. Similarly, even now, OP is receiving the brunt of her father\u2019s failures by being told to feel bad for \u201cmaking\u201d him feel bad for his own actions. Love a bunch of these comments here. And I\u2019m very proud of OP.", "Because all people are imperfect, all people are flawed, all people make mistakes. Without forgiveness, there is no moving forward. He is not WORTHY of forgiveness, no one is, and yet we should seek reconciliation always.   \nRead up on the reconciliation in Rwanda following the 1994 genocide. It's amazing grudges some people will hold onto while others find a way to move on even after a fucking genocide.  \nhttps://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/why-rwanda-is-held-up-as-a-model-for-reconciliation-26-years-after-genocide-1.5842139", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Yeah. My narcissistic sister would always say i was mean when i pointed out her horrible behaviour, because i only remembered the bad things.\nCan't reason with those people.", "Yeah I see how you are trying to close off arguments with the wording.  Like you I don't really expect a narc to concede that their behavior is bad, so I just keep it simple for anyone else who may be listening/reading and ignore any further complaints from the narc.  Since their woe is me act is usually intended to gain sympathy from an audience and turn the victim into a villain I find that the simpler argument is best.", "Excellent point.  OP should ask how telling him about how he treated a child for years is worse than telling an adult about it in a few minutes?  What did they tell HIM while he was doing this?\n\nOP was far less cruel than he was.", "i know people are flawed and people make mistakes. i also know people aren\u2019t worthy of forgiveness. the thing is he didn\u2019t make a mistake, he willingly made the decision to do what he did. he had plenty of time to apologize and try to make things right but he didn\u2019t until the brother died. he\u2019s now paying the price for that. \nyes holding a grudge isn\u2019t healthy and some grudges maybe be stupid to you or me but it\u2019s very valid to others.", "A single PowerPoint is worse than years of child neglect? Are you sure?", "How?  He's seeing the effects of his behavior as it happened.  That can't possibly be any worse than the trauma he inflicted.  \n\nThis is justice.", "How?", "So , nearly a decade of ignoring and basically shoving her to the side is outweighed by a single PowerPoint showing that he failed as a parent?\n\nJust cause one child is sick, doesn't mean you forget you have another child.", "u/LaetilHelianthus you are spot on!! The father inflicted neglect, dehumanization, and pain on OP for 10-15 years. The father was confronted with consequences of his behavior and is supposedly suffering, for all of what? Two weeks max?\n\nDear maligned dad went to ALL the family and showed them how badly OP hurt him. She didn't hurt him. She made a PowerPoint explaining why she doesn't want a relationship with her father. He inflicted that harm on OP for 10-15 years, daily. Dear dad has inflicted the pain on himself by (out of the blue) caring for a relationship with OP.   \n\nSounds like dad should have changed his behavior in the past, then he wouldn't have hurt OP nor himself. \n\nBtw, to the person who labelled OP an ahole: 2 weeks of suffering from self-inflicted harm is damn near non-existent compared to a decade/decade-and-a-half of that harm.\n\nDear dad FAFO. He's responsible for his actions. He did this to himself. OP is blameless."]}
