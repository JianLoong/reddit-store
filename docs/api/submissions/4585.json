Librarian here. Uh, liking to crochet and sudoku is a normal hobby for any age/race/gender. Besides, you are in fact exercising your brain with logic puzzles. Encouraging people to read is great! Shaming them for *not* reading is uncool.", "NTA, it's a good comparison.", "NTA. Your bf is being ridiculous and I think he knows it.", "NTA. Everyone enjoys different things. Not to mention, if you quit crocheting and knitting because of cost- depending on how fast you read, reading would be a super expensive hobby as well. I love to read - and invest in several library services and kindle unlimited. I spend a minimum of $25 a month reading because of those apps - and that's when I don't actually buy books... do what you enjoy, not everyone understands every hobby, but it's not fair to judge someone on it.", "NTA  Sudoku is actually quite good for the brain!", "Also, does he not know the difference between reading a book & solving a sudoku puzzle?\n\n> My boyfriend has raised concerns about why i don't spend my time reading books instead of playing sudoku on my phone.\n\n Lmao. THAT'S why you don't. Because if you read instead you *wouldn't* be solving sudoku problems. Does he even understand hobbies? Hobbies are for *your* interests. Sudoku is *your* interest.", "NTA. A very logical question in my opinion.", "NTA and depending on how serious he's being I wouldn't think he's the asshole either.

Sudoku triggers dopamine in my brain in ways reading doesn\u2019t. Plus my job is very word heavy - writing, reports, all kinds of things. Sudoku allows me to exercise what feels like a different part of my brain. \n \nNot really sure why he\u2019s harping on reading so much. \n \nIf he\u2019s that big on reading then maybe you both should sit and read together. You know\u2026 see how long that lasts when he doesn\u2019t get to play his game.", "NTA\n\nIf you can't handle having your own question turned back on you, don't ask the question. \n\nTurnabout is fair play. \n\nIt's just weird for your bf to think your hobbies need his judgement. He doesn't need to find them interesting, only thing that matters is that you do.", "NTA- and I'd say- I do what I want in my free time.

I'm not the one trying to get you to do something different.", "NTA he\u2019s projecting. Keep knocking it back to him. There is no difference in the two past times.", "NAH.

You could get yourself some cute pens or pencils, a tasty snack or drink, and cozy up with that.

Tbh, It's weird he seems to take any issue with your hobbies at all. It'd be one thing if it was taking you from your relationship or hurting someone, but it's not. It's sudoku lol You do you.", "NTA. And maybe the question you want to be asking him is: why does your playing sudoku unnerve him so much?\n\nIs he scared it\u2019s exercising your brain so well that you\u2019ll end up more intelligent than him, so you\u2019ll leave him?\n\nOr that by keeping your brain active you\u2019ll still be enjoying life at 80+ while he\u2019s suffering from dementia?\n\nWhat, exactly, is scaring him, when he sees you playing sudoku? :-)", "INFO: Was this a one-time disagreement or has Sudoku been a recurring \"problem\"?
