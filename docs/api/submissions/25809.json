Probably not. But if her interest is more in wanting to share a moment with her son, she'd accept an offer like that and appreciate that an accomodation was found.\n\nI doubt that's how such an offer would be taken though. As you said in another comment, it's probably about control.

To be completely in the clear, you really *should* have told his mother a direct \"no\", rather than deflecting it for him to deal with. You knew what your fiance wanted, but in the moment you chickened out.", "ESH - You made a mistake that she will use to manipulate your future husband. Your comments of *\"...talk to hunter first. If he\u2019s okay with it..\"* will eventually get twisted into *'your wife has no problem with it, why are you being so hurtful and unreasonable\"*.\n\nShe is obviously an AH.
