Talk about entitled and selfish. Let your fianc\u00e9 deal with her going forth.", "Oh so very NTA\n\nThis is NOT your MIL's wedding nor is she even special as far as the wedding goes. Just in what she has said to you about cutting in, is her trying to bully YOU now. \n\nIF she is crass enough to actually try and cut in at the wedding, I would make sure she is thrown out. (talk to a couple of guys ahead of time to alert them to the possibility of her acting up).", "NTA\n\n\u201cwell I\u2019m going to cut in during your first dance anyway.\u201d\n\nWhat a selfish thing to say.  Good lord.", "Nta. Just do yourself a favour and don\u2019t invite her.", "NTA.  You backed your fianc\u00e9's wishes.  This is exactly what you should have done.  Just continue to back your fianc\u00e9.  Also, talk with someone to watch out for your MIL during your dance.  Looks like you may need someone to run interference for you and your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA\n\nBased on the post, would you expect any other reaction.  You honored and respected your fianc\u00e9 and responded appropriately.  Hunter will need to have a plan in mind that day.", "NTA but let your fiance handle it.\n\nJust keep telling FMIL that she needs to speak with her son.  Do not give her a reason why she won't be dancing with him as that is for him to handle.\n\nMake sure the DJ or band know that under no circumstances are they to announce a mother-son dance.  And have someone to corral FMIL during your first dance should she try to enter the dance floor.", "You are NTA.  But from here forward, let your fiance deal with her.", "NTA. You were very tactful and courteous while respecting your fiances wishes.", "NTA.  Honestly, you should disinvite her.  She's going to find a way to make it about her and bring the drama.  You can count on it.\n\nHunter should have a chat with his dad and explain it.\n\nBy the way, really well handled on your part.  Your answer was perfect and leaving it up to Hunter was perfect.", "NTA, but have a trusted male friend (or 2), maybe FIL and a BIL, or your brother (if you have them) or cousins at the ready during the first dance. If MIL does decide to try to cut in, make sure she\u2019s escorted out of the room. Does your fianc\u00e9 have buddies who play football or rugby? Nothing like a couple of line backers to yeet NIL out of the room while you and he dance. Good luck and have a lovely wedding!", "NTA, and fianc\u00e9 needs to man up and tell her himself.", "NTA\n\nYou're going to have to set very firm boundaries with her and keep to them. You might want to visit r|justnomil I have a feeling you will find your people there.", "NTA - tell her the classy thing to do is to join in after a few minutes with her own husband.", "NTA. Clear boundary, respecting his wishes and empathizing while not getting in the middle. From the outside I do wonder, if he doesn\u2019t want to dance with her why even invite her. But he knows his dynamic better than any of us. You did the right thing.", "NTA, of course. Why would you be an AH for sticking up for your partner?", "NTA. You handled it well.\n\nFMIL is not upset because of how you handled it poorly. FMIL is upset because the answer was not what she wanted.\n\nThe funny thing to me is that you and your fiance's boundary is not \"no dances with his mom\". It's \"slow dancing only with each other\". There are ways that could be respected and still give his mom a dance eith him.\n\nThere are plenty of fast dance styles that could be used for this... swing, salsa, cha-cha... just to name a few \n\nWould it be what FMIL really wants? Probably not. But if her interest is more in wanting to share a moment with her son, she'd accept an offer like that and appreciate that an accomodation was found.\n\nI doubt that's how such an offer would be taken though. As you said in another comment, it's probably about control. That sort of offer would be giving her what she says she wants (a dance) without giving her any room to be able to do what she's even hinted she really wants (interupting dances that you and your fianc\u00e9 want to share).", "NTA is your fiance in therapy because he should be.  \n\nHe staying in contact with his abusive mom so he can near his ( adoring ) dad.  \n\nI know you said he adores his Dad.   \n\nBut to me it reads like his Dad is a enabler of his mom's abuse.   \n\nWhat kind of man stays with the woman who is abusing his child ?  \n\nHe doesn't sound that great to me.   \n\nSorry I went off topic.", "NTA but it is time to think about every answer you give her. Just yes or no answers. Do not give her anything she can twist, because she will twist your words and probably lie, definitely manipulate.  If it is something Hunter should handle, just say Talk to Hunter, do not add anything else.", "NTA. You drift in that direction, but maybe not for the reason you think. To be completely in the clear, you really *should* have told his mother a direct \"no\", rather than deflecting it for him to deal with. You knew what your fiance wanted, but in the moment you chickened out.", "ESH - You made a mistake that she will use to manipulate your future husband. Your comments of *\"...talk to hunter first. If he\u2019s okay with it..\"* will eventually get twisted into *'your wife has no problem with it, why are you being so hurtful and unreasonable\"*.\n\nShe is obviously an AH. You are a very mild one too. You could have supported your husband's wishes more firmly. Instead you inadvertently gave her ammunition for the future argument.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
