Never a \u201chappy birthday \u201c or \u201cmerry Christmas\u201d ever. My dad lives across the country but when my fianc\u00e9 and I traveled to see him, and introduce them to each other, she never showed up. He said she couldn\u2019t make it but never elaborated. \nWhen younger is attempted to reach out (just sending a happy holidays text) but no reply. She won\u2019t even come to the phone if we\u2019re on it.\nFast forward to now and I\u2019m planning my wedding. I invited my dad. He asked if she can come too. Im torn. Part of me wants to be the bigger person and invite her. The other part of me doesn\u2019t want to waste the time, energy or money on someone that has never wanted a relationship with me and has never so much as acknowledged I exist, before. \nIf I don\u2019t invite her and my dad decides to not come, I honestly won\u2019t be that salty about it. \nI asked my mom her opinion and she doesn\u2019t care either way.

Just give dad a +1. It\u2019ll send a solid enough message and also extend enough of an invitation. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t personally invite her tho", "You do know that your dad is also incredibly strange, and there has to be more to this than simply \"not interested.\"  Did your dad tell her that you exist? (I mean - She obviously knows now, but when into their relationship/marriage, did he mention he has kids).  Why didn't your dad make meeting his children a condition of his relationship?", "Invite her but she is not to be in ANY photos. She is to be treated like a plus one of a distant relative.\n\nAlso ask  your dad why she wants to come after being a no show all those other times.\n\nNTA", "Nta!\nI would say be the bigger person and think of it as if you are giving your dad the option to bring his plus one. \nIf/when she shows up, you can treat her like his plus one as that is exactly what she has been all this time. \nYou may not mind for your dad to come/not to come now, but down the line in future, you will think differently. \n\nBtw, congratulations on pending nuptials!", "NTA. But if you want to have a good relationship with your dad, give him a +1. You don\u2019t have to invite her, personally, but give your father a chance to go to the wedding with his wife. If your relationship isn\u2019t something you care about, don\u2019t give him that option, but don\u2019t be surprised when he goes no contact or low contact with you. \nDon\u2019t think about a half-stranger, think about your dad and yourself. What\u2019s the best option for your relationship and your own peace of mind?", "NTA.  Why would you invite a complete stranger to your wedding.  Tell Dad you don't want strangers there.", "NTA \n\nShe's actively avoided you for 20 years.  She sucks. But you'll be inviting a lot of people you don't know if you let people bring +1s. So make it clear he's allowed a +1 if he wants, but you're not inviting her as a named guest.", "NTA! It\u2019s your wedding. I would explain to your father that since she has spent 20yrs ignoring your existence then you don\u2019t feel comfortable with her at your wedding. He should be okay with that. He was okay with his wife ignoring his child. It should work both ways. \n\nAlso don\u2019t let people talk you into being the \u201cbigger person\u201d. That\u2019s so annoying. It\u2019s just a way for people to allow others to mistreat people and get away with it. You have one life to live. She lived 20yrs of hers doing whatever she wanted with little to no regard to you. You can do the same guilt free.", "NTA but it sounds like she won\u2019t even show up anyways.", "NTA, but I would invite her. She probably won\u2019t come, but at least you will know none of it is on you.", "NTA. Based on her previous behaviour, if you invite her she likely won't come anyway so whay waste the energy?", "NTA- but I would probably invite her with your father or give him a plus one if you can afford it to avoid any drama. It's really AH moves of her to not acknowledge you given how long she's been in your life.\n\nCongrats on getting married.", "NTA but you should invite her. You cannot invite a married person to a family even and exclude their spouse unless you want to ensure that the invitee does not come. Invite them both - if you\u2019d done this in the first place it likely wouldn\u2019t have been an issue as your dad would almost certainly have come alone.", "Just send an invitation for your father + 1. \n\nThat way, he can bring her as a date and since you've never met the woman, she could be his mistress or neighbour or whatever. \n\nYou'll be too busy with the wedding to talk to anyone anyway.", "NTA. I wouldn't invite a stranger to my wedding.", "It's your wedding, your time, your event.  Leave the negative energy at home and have folks there that truly support you.  This is definitely a NTA thing.", "Invite her as a distante plus 1 like a SO of a cowork.", "INFO: Does your dad\u2019s wife actually exist?\n\nBtw NTA.", "Figure out why she\u2019s never been around? That you want to meet her before hand and need an explanation. Was she an affair partner and bad out of guilt? What\u2019s the deal?", "NTA but something is off. As others said give dad a +1 but confirm in advance that she is not to be included in any family photos. \nIt also might be a good opportunity to ask dad, 'why now?' She hasn't wanted to ever meet. \nI'd get it out of the way before they come to the wedding.", "Are you sure she exists?", "NAH.\n\nBut just invite her.  At my wedding I spent about 15 seconds talking to each guest before moving on.", "NTA. You are well within your right to not invite her if you don't want to. She obviously doesn't want a relationship with you so she shouldn't care that she isn't invited anyway.", "NTA \n\nExplain to your dad and if he doesn\u2019t like it that\u2019s his problem. He\u2019s the one who\u2019s going to miss milestones and not you especially if he\u2019s got no more children. All you do is match the energy she\u2019s giving and that\u2019s not inviting or investing anything more of your time in her.", "OP, in neither case you'd be TA. You're NTA all the way. Ignoring you for all this years is the true AH move.\n\nAsk yourself whether her presence at the wedding would bother you. Weddings tend to be stressful (mine was, even though we only invited our good friends and the closest family), and  you shouldn't be focusing on her during that day. If you can feel relaxed with her there, invite her as a plus one. If not, and you'd be constantly thinking about her... let go. This day should be about happy things, not unresolved family issues.", "NTA whatever you do. Invite her or not.\n\nI think you treat this like she's your dad's new GF of 6 months- the relationship is the same. Invite her but when you do stuff like plan the photo list and stuff- she's just not included in photos with you and your dad or you and your dad's side of the family. \n\nMaybe she'll surprise you that weekend. And if not, well- you didn't put any extra effort into it.", "NTA. Just invite her anyway she probably won\u2019t come if she has spent this long avoiding you. It\u2019s so weird to never have met her.", "NTA.  Give your father a plus one and if she comes introduce her as my dad\u2019s plus one.", "NTA It's your wedding. Do what you want. From an out-of-town-guest etiquette POV (discussed ad nauseum on Weddit) if you want someone to travel to your wedding & pay for airfare, hotel etc but you don't want to invite their SO or their kids, you are probably looking at a declined invite. Nobody wants to travel alone or have to find 4 days of childcare so they can go to your wedding. (This obviously is general out-of-town-guest invite etiquette, OP doesn't have the childcare thing to worry about.) Your Dad would have more fun with the wife. If her presence is going to bother you, don't invite her. But I bet you will be so busy getting married, you won't notice her.", "NTA. Maybe meet her in advance and see how it goes.", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding day. You should be surrounded by people your love and supported you. If she is not one of those, she doesn\u2019t have to be there. She hasn\u2019t made an effort in all the 20 years she\u2019s been married to your father. Frankly, I find him asking if she can attend is a big slap in the face as he never seem to have an issue with her never engaging with his own children. He\u2019s been okay with her behavior all these years and now wants her to attend one of the biggest milestone of your life. Ultimately your decision you don\u2019t want her there she doesn\u2019t need to be.", "Be the bigger person invite her, she won't show up, worst thing is she will say yes and you have to pay for an empty plate.   Make your dad happy by inviting her.\n\nShe's the asshole, don't let her make you one too.", "NTA of course!!!  You shouldn't have to invite a stranger to your wedding.  Or she can come but she needs to pay her own way.  \n\nI just don't really understand how he's been married to her for 20 years but you've never met her?   Did you never visit your dad at his home for 20 years?", "NTA. I would throw an invitation out there. However, still not expect her to show up. If she does, awesome. Spend about 5 seconds saying hi. I'd be mad if she made your wedding day all about meeting her for the first time \ud83d\ude44", "INFO\n\nIf this was an old highchool or college friend with a spouse you hadn't met, would you invite the spouse?", "Knee jerk response would have been NO, this is a special event and shes made ZERO effort in 20 years to even speak to you. NO NO NO NO", "YTA because of this: you don't want to \"waste the time, energy or money.\" Can't really see that it would involve much of that. Takes little time to address an invitation and mail it. It's only one more mouth to feed at a reception. I can't see how inviting one extra person adds much.\n\nFrankly, the impression I get from you is that you don't care about your father at all. After all, you say if he doesn't come to the wedding you won't be upset. So why bother inviting him at all?\n\nWhat I would do is invite him and his wife and have done with it. I'm sure you can get thru the day w/o dealing w/them very much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Let you dad know that only friends and family are going to be in attendance and she didn't want to be either, so no invite for her.", "NTA\n\nDo what you feel is best. She has never made an attempt to be apart of your life so don't feel as if you owe it to her. Would be kinda awkward in my opinion for her to be involved after 20 years.", "NAH - given the history here, I would 100% not expect her to attend.  It might be easiest to include her on the invite anyways with the calculated risk that she'll decline, but it's leaving the door open with your dad.", "NTA. This right here is your answer. *If I don\u2019t invite her and my dad decides to not come, I honestly won\u2019t be that salty about it.* She never made any effort to acknowledge you. That's a pretty clear message.", "NTA but invite her. Send the invite to the both of them. It's a win win situation really;\n\nThink about it, for 20 years she's made no effort, she's not gonna change now. Your dad is most likely going to show up alone but by sending the invite addressed to both of them, they can't say jack shit about it. They can't claim you are being petty or anything of the sort.", "Personally invite her. With hells and whistles. Be the bigger person and maybe your dad will surprise you by realizing what an AH his wife is.", ">Just give dad a +1. It\u2019ll send a solid enough message and also extend enough of an invitation\n\nThat's probably the best advice here.", "Honestly, I kinda wonder if maybe the wife is actually a husband or something. They do seem to be trying awfully hard to hide something if spouse won't even talk on the phone or anything. I mean, how can you be married to someone for 20 yrs and never meet their kids? The vibe is just weird. Who knows.", "This. I don't think it's a big deal not to invite her, but it's courteous to allow your father a plus one. If you think of it in that light, you won't have any expectations of her, and she will be no bigger a part of the day than other other guest of a guest.", "FWIW Lots of people invite strangers to their weddings in the form of a \u201cplus one.\u201d", "I agree. Also, she may just be a drama bomb waiting for a reason to explode.", "Look at who you've given +1's to.\n\n+1's are for people who are important to you, to bring someone to share that memory with, even if that +1 doesn't have a relationship with you.\n\nSo invite them if it aligns with who you've given +1's to, and consider it a +1 and treat them that evening as the +1 they are. They are not invited for themselves. (I wouldn't go so far as to put that on the RSVP mind you). \n\nIf you invite her, lay down ground rules with your father so its clear before they accept, if there are things you don't want her to participate in (pictures, pre-wedding events, etc). This is your day and event, someone you've never met should show up, be nice, and not get in the way.", "I was thinking the same thing! How can you go 20 years without ever speaking, hearing, or seeing her ONCE", ">Or she can come but she needs to pay her own way.\n\nYeah, somehow I don't see that happening. What is the invite supposed to say, \"dad eats for free and as for his wife, we expect money transfer by tuesday'?", "OP wrote that Dad\u2019s wife was never around during visits.\n\nAre we sure she even exists?", "I get your point. The only difference is I\u2019ve TRIED to know her and have been avoided or brushed off.", "This, she won\u2019t come, so why alienate your dad?\nAnd if she does, you are not obliged to spend any time on her. Make sure she is seated somewhere where it doesn\u2019t feel out-of-place if she RSVP yes, but is a no-show.", "There\u2019s a good chance she won\u2019t come anyway. A formal invitation would make her feel obligated but this way she can choose and most likely will choose to stay home.", "I wondered the same thing, does she exist, did she leave him years ago and he doesn't want to admit it, or is she buried under the patio, or is she a he?", "Yes but this one CHOSE to be a stranger for 20 years.", "lol.  i think i just skimmed the article, i was thinking he needs to pay to fly them over or something!  hahah.  not the dinner.   oops.", "I get that. She clearly does not want to know you, which is shitty. But the question now is whether you're inviting her as your dad's family. I don't think you're TA either way, but I do think you need to let go of the idea that this woman owes you any sort of relationship.", "There is a huge difference between an old school friend, and a parent\u2019s spouse of 20 years. Which should not be dismissed.", "This.  Either way, she is finding a way to stay home.  Invite her."]}
