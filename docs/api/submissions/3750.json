We sleep all day, wake up go to work and then everything\u2019s closed by 10. So if we don\u2019t order, we don\u2019t eat\u2026or we eat at the vending machine. Smallish big deal, but not the end of the world.", "Yeah, I was gonna edit to clarify: SHE LIVED. \n\nBut, I guess it\u2019s apparent", "So maybe he must starve himself just because there is a possibility someone is allergic to whatever food he wants to eat?", "Yes", "Considering her way of checking if a new food place is okay is basically trying and see what happens...I doubt her allergy is so severe that reactions kick in just by smelling it. OP stated in a previews comment this is not a seafood restaurant per se, but a sports bar with several food options. They also have separate break stations and said that they would never do something like use the fridge or microwave in common area. So how far does OP need to run from M in order to eat? She acts like she can't be anywhere near a 5km radius from shellfish but she herself behaves in a way that puts her at risk once outside the hospital. Makes no sense at all.", "Top judgements are read manually now so it's good either way :)", "I\u2019m laughing so hard at the Niles Crane line, because I saw his face and heard his voice lol", "We have others allergic to peanuts and we keep snickers on the unit for snacks lol", "I dolphinately agree.  I\u2019m turtley urchin to sea what happens next.", "This is sole-ly her problem and she should quit carping at him.", "Which you wouldn't have even known if not for your glib comment. \n\n\nESH \n\n\nI wouldn't want her as my doctor...I'd much rather have a doctor who says \"Here is what you do, just in case\". \n\n\nBut if she doesn't even carry an epi pen, then her allergies aren't so severe that accidental airborne exposure would be an issue. She's comfortable walking in public places and touching public surfaces. \n\n\nSo you are not an AH for ordering food from where you want to order it from. You aren't requiring everyone to order from there or stopping her from getting her own food.", "If \u201cthey started/asked for it\u201d is the best defense you\u2019ve got, I think you already know you\u2019re the asshole.", "When you chose to order food, you were doing so under the assumption that she DID have an epipen. You doubled down once you found out she didn\u2019t, but your initial attitude was that it was ok to make her use emergency medication just so you could order from a certain restaurant.\n\nYou were willing to make her use up some of her emergency supply of medication just so you could get your way. You didn\u2019t care about the cost, the inconvenience of having to replace the medication, or even the simple fact that having to be hospitalized mid-shift was going to mess up everyone\u2019s schedule for the night.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t about her lack of an epipen until you were already being cavalier about her health, and that\u2019s why YTA.", "Bullshit. \n\nYou haven't had a single break in 2 years? You've worked your eveey shift fully without a single break?", "Because it's a SEAFOOD RESTAURANT. They can say  there'll be no cross contamination but as nurse you surely must know that guaranteeing no cross contamination is impossible.", "Lmao so confidently incorrect. There is literally no reason anyone should NOT take a dose of adrenaline if they're having AN ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION.", "She can order her own food from a different place.  I\u2019m sure she has attended dinner and parties where there is seafood and to not have an epi pen is beyond stupid. I\u2019m allergic to nuts and bees and always have one.  Yes something could get cross contamination but I find every restaurant is super carful when I explain my allergies.", "Okay? That doesn't give you the right to intentionally expose her. You don't HAVE to have shellfish at work.", "Would have been a plot twist ending if she didn\u2019t... She asked you to keep everything contained & clean. Should\u2019ve been the end of it.... The world doesn\u2019t stop turning because of allergies. \n\nJust because I\u2019m curious now... what seafood dish did you order from a sports bar?", "What would be considered normal full time hours where you live? Where I live, it's between 40-50hrs per week. My sister is a nurse and her normal weekly schedule is 60 hours (5 x 12hr shifts). A 36 hour week is considered part time in most of the world that I am familiar with.", "Going up above to edit my judgment.", "I was trying to remove things that could identify us, thought \u201cwork in a hospital overnight\u201d was enough of a hint. Sorry", "I didn\u2019t say she\u2019s asking for it. I said she\u2019s a medical professional who\u2019s known for 3 years she needed an epi pen and never got one. she doesn\u2019t care, but expects everyone around her to. Seems right", "I didn\u2019t assume she had an epi pen. Her and I started the job at the same time together, she talks about her allergies frequently and her severe reactions. Shes also always been honest about not wanting to get a new epipen. I\u2019ve mentioned to her in the past that she really needs to get an epi pen. And she responds every time that it\u2019s expired and she doesn\u2019t want one. I guess I just got tired of avoiding my favorite restaurants to accommodate someone who doesn\u2019t take their own allergies that seriously. Maybe that does kinda make me a bit of an asshole.", "I\u2019m a nurse, and I work overnight. We don\u2019t leave the unit for breaks. Although we still have to clock out for them.", "I said no where in the paragraph it was a seafood restaurant. I said it has a lot of seafood and non seafood options. It\u2019s actually a sports bar, if you want to get technical lol", "Lol, I\u2019m not forcing her to eat shellfish. And no one forced her to order.", "That\u2019s sad. I\u2019m sorry for everyone who is expected to spend at least 60 hours a week at work at a permanent job. \n\nI have heard of that but only with travel positions under contract that get 2-3x average pay and only last a few weeks.", "Wtf", "I know you're a nurse ive said that several times. \n\nYou still take breaks on night shift but you remain on call for emergencies.", "You asked if you're a arsehole. \n\nI said yes you are and now you're arguing because you don't wnat to accept that, as a nurse, you should be more considerate of your colleagues and patients. \n\nYou can argue all you want it won't change my mind. When I was a nurse I would never dream of putting a colleague at risk. Ever.", "So you don't want to know if Yta you just wanna complain", "And I\u2019m not intentionally exposing her, I chose a restaurant that I love to eat from. She doesn\u2019t have to eat anything. And I\u2019m not shoving my food in her face.", "Airborne allergies are a real danger and YOU COULD BE EXPOSING PATIENTS TOO", "I mean, I live in Canada where we have pretty robust labour laws. Union protection (in the case of my sister). I just work a retail job and I still work 45 hours a week, which is considered to be full time. 36 hours a week wouldn't even be considered to be full time work. \n\nIf 36 hours a week is overtime where you live, is full time considered to be 2 shifts a week? And part time just one shift a week? I can't wrap my head around your description at all. How would you make a living wage by working just 36 hours a week? I understand that you're a medical professional and cost of living is different everywhere. I'm just having a hard time trying to figure out your description.", "\u2026we don\u2019t take breaks. At least not on my unit. We never leave the unit. Who is going to come cover my break? Yes, we have moments we are caught up and get to sit down. But we never leave the unit for what people consider a real break.", "I\u2019m just correcting you. You can absolutely think I\u2019m an asshole if you want.", "I\u2019m not complaining, I just corrected his statement that it was a seafood restaurant.", "If she was that allergic she would have a epi pen.", "FYI we don\u2019t eat shellfish in our patients rooms. And there is an ingredient in iodine, which we use to clean patients, that shares an element with shellfish. As long as we don\u2019t run it on the patient, they are fine. I\u2019m not rubbing my food in her face or forcing it down anyones throat. Or eating it in my patients rooms for that matter.\n\nEdit: rub", "See other comment where OP states they have different work station\u2026 as the tiny aerosolized proteins can\u2019t fly through walls - look at that! Both coworker and patients are safe o.O also I doubt that OP, as someone with a medical degree, wouldn\u2019t know how allergies work\u2026 \nLast thing if this is your argument as to why OP shouldn\u2019t eat shellfish then no one could ever anywhere eat shellfish again - you never know if there\u2019s an allergic person hiding around the corner\n\nEdit typo", "You take a break on the unit like everywhere nurse on the planet. \n\nOr are you saying that you work constantly during nightshift? Don't bs us, I was a nurse for years I know how busy it gets on a ward that's npt a and e or icu. \n\nI'm done with this conversation. You're a arsehole end of discussion.", "And yet you continue to argue. \n\nAs I said you are a arsehole. \n\nBe a better nurse and person in future.", "Don't listen to these people that say y t a because you are not.", "Yikes you need to stop commenting. Just because OP is a nurse, doesn't exclude them from needing to eat and not needing to take responsibility for someone else's allergy (who doesn't even give enough of a fuck to carry an epipen anyway??). \n\nM isn't going to go into shock from smelling OP's dinner. NO ONE is asking them to eat it."]}
