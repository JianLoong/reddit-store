I have good insurance but it is still very costly (in fact the insurance makes them more expensive thanks USA).\n\nAlso taking Epi isn\u2019t just like popping a Tylenol.  You end up having to go to the hospital for heart monitoring so there is some risk and danger involved that it could cause heart issues, not to mention some pretty significant additional costs to go to the ER and potentially be admitted.  Even antihistamines cause big problems.  You can have rebound reactions for up to 3 days.  The last time I accidentally ingested a nut I ended up out of work for a week.\n\nAdditionally, I had really bad reactions to Epi when I was a kid to the point that multiple doctors recommended I don\u2019t use it and find a way to avoid the allergens because they were unsure if the Epi would make it worse.

She may still try to escalate this, so just be careful in the future OP. \n\nBack to the coworker, I can't believe that she was so careless to not re-up her Epi-Pen. If she's that sensitive to shellfish then her being super careful isn't a 100% guarantee that she'll avoid the allergen. She can't predict when someone may be walking around town with a shellfish dish or when someone may have last eaten shellfish. That's a game of Russian roulette that she would absolutely lose at some point and if she's lucky, losing would \"only\" hospitalize her briefly.

IF the charge nurse and coworker were to escalate this to HR, they'd portray it like this: OP wanted to order something coworker was allergic to, coworker asked them not to because it would cause a reaction, OP refused and ordered it anyway. It wouldn't matter that this is an inaccurate portrayal of what actually happened AND that the coworker wasn't taking their own proper precautions. HR is there to protect the workplace, not OP, so he can't and shouldn't expect them to have his back. I'm not saying that he's TA, just that he needs to protect himself in situations like this.

I avoid those as much as I can, but I do carry an epi-pen because I can't assume the people around me aren't going to have carrots or celery in their food. Thankfully, I haven't had to use it, but there's no guarantee I can avoid any contact with carrots or celery at any time. Your co-worker needs to know what she can and cannot do and carry an epi-pen just in case. I'm sure she's been bear shellfish plenty of times and not even know it. But, she needs to find her limits before expecting her co-workers and friends to change their ways.\n\nEdited to add: If she finds out that her allergy is bad enough she cannot be in the same room as shellfish without going into shock, then that would need to be announced and it would be the respectful and kind thing for you and co-workers to respect that too.

Food allergies can be severe.  For shellfish and nuts in particular.  Nuts generally require that you eat them to have a reaction.  However, shellfish can inspire a reaction by simply having enough of it wafting smells around in the area of a person with a severe allergy.  The antigen can be made airborne in some instances in these settings. Imagine what it would have been like for her to be working where EVERYONE had her allergen for a meal and the potential for a severe reaction as a result was a strong potential? What if people aren't careful and cross-contamination occurred in the workplace? How inconsiderate does a group of people have to be? It's not like it was merely an issue of liking or not liking something. Her allergy could have very severe effects.  And frankly, the fact you know she's allergic and still did that -- that could be taken as a threat. \n\n Anaphylaxis is no joke. And it COULD kill her. And it sounds like you are in a healthcare setting and should know better than to do this.  So don't be surprised if there is an HR complaint filed or other consequences.  If I were her, I would view this as a hostile act, and go full court press to address this situation.  Because all of you deserve it.   What would have been the plan if she did collapse and nearly die anyhow? Who would pick up her work?  How are you going to explain the fact that while you all knew she had an allergy to the food, you exposed her anyhow?  And God help you if you have a license, especially a nursing one.  A complaint to the BON over something like this would likely incite discipline - fines, suspension, or even possibly revocation if the consequences had been severe.   And you would deserve it.

Like was that you just trying to trap her in a lie ? \n\nAnd even her response to your comment then makes no sense ? Like if you\u2019re saying this is the best place to have a reaction presumably because you know it\u2019s a hospital and you apparently are all swimming in not just autoinjectors instead of ampules / vials but the most expensive name brand autoinjector. And her response is oh well mine is expired. Like you two don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re involved in the same conversation. If you\u2019re saying you have epipens all over the place and this is the best place to risk it and understand epinephrine is needed for allergies\u2026why then suddenly make a whole thing about her not having her own personal one (which also is freaking weird and makes me think she\u2019s probably not actually allergic).\n\nAnd you\u2019re working in a hospital you should be cleaning up after yourself anyway right? She\u2019s being super extra and I would be annoyed as hell at her too but wouldn\u2019t the only difference be you not going near her with the food? It was a rule / common courtesy to wipe down the table and clean your dishes at offices I\u2019ve been at so maybe that\u2019s not the norm and she\u2019s also asking you to scrub a surface possibly. Would you not be washing your hands anyway? How is that catering to her ? \n\nYou both are either the most clueless people  with some weirdness going on or there was some fundamental misunderstanding at the root of this conversation.\n\nJust avoid her in the future because she definitely sounds like the drama regardless.

It\u2019s the same med, you just have to draw it up in the syringe yourself instead of having the auto injector. \n\nAnother thing about epi pens that not everyone knows: they actually contain more than one dose. It will only deliver one dose, and once it\u2019s used it won\u2019t work again, but there is still more medicine in it. \n\nIf you absolutely had to (think stuck in the wilderness on a trip and waiting on emergency services to arrive) you can carefully open up the epi pen and manually draw out some of the remaining medicine if you have a clean syringe with you.  \n\nThis is one of those \u201cnot likely to be needed, but could actually save a life someday\u201d tips. I learned about it when I was an instructor for the American Heart Association, and my ex also learned the same thing in wilderness survival training. They kept extra syringes in their first aid kits for this reason.", "Everyone is mad and downvoting which is fine. I've read that many schools in the US have a \"peanut free\" policy. \n\nI've  never met anyone that even carries an epy pen. Do I know, adults or kids with allergies? Yes, my own kids were allergic to dairy as babies. But, like I said, I've never met anyone with such extreme allergies.", "Mexico, Spain and Austria, did I met people with allergies? Yes. \n\nDid I ever meet someone to forbid everyone around to eat whatever food they were allergic to? Never. \n\nI've read about it in Reddit many times. I'm curious about what is it with americans that is different, is it something about their inmune system?", "If you don\u2019t mind me asking, does this allergy extend to the whole onion family, for instance spring onions, leeks, etc?", "Even in Canada they are like $250 or more with our health care! I used to not really carry them for a long time or carry an expired one because of the cost - only recently I got insurance through my husbands work so they are now like 20$", "Mine was $350 for 2 10 years ago \ud83c\udf89 can only imagine what it would be if I needed it now (was temporarily taking a medicine they thought I may be allergic to, but it was my only option. So I\u2019d preemptively Benadryl the shit out of myself to take it)", "Epi pens can be really expensive, but you can also have your doc write your script for a vial of epi and some syringes. I have friends who carry that bc it\u2019s like $20 instead of $400. It\u2019s not convenient for kids or people who can\u2019t administer the med themselves via vial and syringe, but just about any \u201chealth care professional\u201d would be able to handle it. And it would be worth carrying at work bc even if she couldn\u2019t give it to herself if she was incapacitated, obviously one of her coworkers could.", "In Europe restaurants have to disclose the list of allergens in the menu. It's a really good thing because it makes the places safer and increase their clientele. \nHaving more GF options in restaurants will attract more customers. So it's a good thing. I think most pubs in England have GF options"]}
