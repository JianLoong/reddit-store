I have good insurance but it is still very costly (in fact the insurance makes them more expensive thanks USA).\n\nAlso taking Epi isn\u2019t just like popping a Tylenol.  You end up having to go to the hospital for heart monitoring so there is some risk and danger involved that it could cause heart issues, not to mention some pretty significant additional costs to go to the ER and potentially be admitted.  Even antihistamines cause big problems.  You can have rebound reactions for up to 3 days.

She may still try to escalate this, so just be careful in the future OP. \n\nBack to the coworker, I can't believe that she was so careless to not re-up her Epi-Pen. If she's that sensitive to shellfish then her being super careful isn't a 100% guarantee that she'll avoid the allergen. She can't predict when someone may be walking around town with a shellfish dish or when someone may have last eaten shellfish. That's a game of Russian roulette that she would absolutely lose at some point and if she's lucky, losing would \"only\" hospitalize her briefly.

In an ideal world the coworker would take proper precautions and/or not lie about the severity of their allergies, but it's not a perfect world. This coworker sounds like the type who would absolutely throw OP under the bus, so he should be very careful about what he says, where, and to whom. Especially as he works in a hospital and those places can be rife with workplace drama. Night shifts are more relaxed, but offhand comments said in anger can still end in HR nonsense. \n\nEspecially since the coworker has the charge nurse on their side. IF the charge nurse and coworker were to escalate this to HR, they'd portray it like this: OP wanted to order something coworker was allergic to, coworker asked them not to because it would cause a reaction, OP refused and ordered it anyway. It wouldn't matter that this is an inaccurate portrayal of what actually happened AND that the coworker wasn't taking their own proper precautions. HR is there to protect the workplace, not OP, so he can't and shouldn't expect them to have his back. I'm not saying that he's TA, just that he needs to protect himself in situations like this. I've worked with people petty enough that they would deliberately try to expose themselves so they could \"win\" and get the other person in trouble.", "Actually as soon as my daughter was diagnosed with food allergies they give you an epi pen. Just because you aren\u2019t anaphylactic the first exposure doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be the next time", "So I put what I ordered in the first draft but I feel like it\u2019s such an identifier because it was a topic of turmoil at work that night and possibly be able to identify the restaurant, which there aren\u2019t many of so I left it out.", "You realize there\u2019s a shit ton of \u201ccommon\u201d allergies, right? I understand elementary schools with rules against peanuts but by high school age, most districts and parents realize people can be responsible for their own allergies. High schools have peanut free tables instead, so the people with said allergy can be responsible for their health without impacting thousands of other students. \n\nSo tell my why a woman in the medical field is neglecting to have her life saving medication and is incapable of not touching her coworkers seafood? Or is she just mad she has to order her own food?", ">but at least being mindful of our actions go a long way.\n\n\nBe mindful? How else? Cos her only compromise here is: NONE. \n\nShe should use her app and order for herself and let others live", "Inclusive or exclusive of lunch/dinner break?", "Thank you for saying this, I am still on your side that she was being unreasonable", "Since you don't care if your coworker will have to experience something as mild as hives to some as severe as complete anaphylaxis and you don't care how incredibly stressful it is knowing the people you work with in a medical setting do not care if they make you sick, you should care if she takes this to HR with a letter from her Doctor or if she litterally dies because someone decided to eat the allergen and not clean enough after. I wonder how long she needs to wait before that room will feel safe to go into?", "It was when I commented too! I just meant that a mod would read their comment and see that their judgement is really NTA, so it wouldn't matter if they spaced out the YTA that appeared first.", "No because one of the worst case scenarios is when your teammate becomes the patient.  It means the person working with a patient just became another patient with an emergent need.  That means a team that had xx number of people to assist one patient is now down one team member and has two patients.", "My old company someone had an apple allergy and no one I was allowed to bring apples to work and there were signs posted about it on all the floors we occupied in the building.", "Because unless the person with the allergy has been granted special accommodations from HR that an entire hospital will never have seafood (it\u2019s served out of dietary for patients btw) within it or never treat patients who\u2019ve consumed seafood (can\u2019t be done) there is a reasonable expectation that there might be seafood within the workplace.", "Op wasn't knowingly bringing in an allergen. They wanted a sports bar menu item, which may or may not have seafood as part of that item. And they asked if anyone else was interested in ordering as well. They even offered to contact the bar, and see if there were any safe foods that the co-worker could order. Co-worker even admitted that they figure \"their\" restaurant of choice is safe, because they went in, ordered, ate, and had no reactions. They didn't say they asked about seafood, they admitted to having as expired epi pen, which they didn't even carry, and only insisted that op take strict precautions After they didn't get an apology for \"gasp\" ordering from somewhere not approved of.", "A person who chokes on a bone at a seafood restaurant and is taken to a hospital is in the correct place.  A person who slips on ice, breaks a bone, and is taken to a hospital from outside of the same seafood restaurant following their meal is also in the correct place.  Same way a person who just chowed down 2 peanut butter cups and ended up in the ER for a bike accident is in the correct place.  There is no reason for them to not go to the hospital for their emergency just because they\u2019ve eaten food that some people are allergic to.  If an individual is so sensitive that they cannot be around someone who consumed an allergen away from them at an earlier time they are a liability in a hospital.  Patients with a sensitivity that high would be setup on specialized precautions for staff interactions and entry to their space.  \n\nA person entering a business may have eaten food that could be an allergen.  They are the public.  They aren\u2019t required to follow an individuals allergen needs unless explicitly stated in the terms to do business", "8 year olds aren't adults at work with the freedom to remove themselves from the room where the food is. 8 year olds aren't medical professionals who cry about their allergy yet don't care enough to carry an EpiPen they can buy with their adult insurance and adult money.  Your argument is stupid at best.", "In case anyone is wondering, I'm absolutely not on the coworker's side. She's careless and sounds toxic as hell. But it's a situation that could absolutely be spun to make OP look like the bad person if it was escalated, so he needs to be super careful on how he proceeds. It's wrong that this is the way it is, but it's not something that can be easily changed and OP needs to watch out for himself and his job.", "TL;DNR: The poster (not OP) was taking a too cavalier stance on allergies and I was afraid that they may not believe that allergies could be that severe. I was also warning OP that he needs to be careful, because the coworker seems like the type who would deliberately try to screw him over and present things to HR in a deceitful way in order to get him in trouble. Gotta be careful of what you say in the workplace, unfortunately.", "Either her reaction was severe enough that they suspect she could be anaphylactic or our countries have different thresholds for giving out epi pens because you 100% would not be given an epi pen for a mild allergy in the UK", "In that case, your post was misleading.", "Lol everyone is so intrigued by my hours and my break. Guys, I\u2019m eating raviolis bingeing Wednesday because I was off last night. Idk shit about shit about shit", "I wonder how I would feel if I had a food allergy yet did nothing actively protect myself from said allergy like carry an epipen. She is a medical professional, and the onus is on her.", "Ehh... you've got to be careful. Hospitals can get pretty toxic. I've worked in a lot of places, but the most toxic environment I've ever worked in was an ER. I've seen people punished for saying something in the heat of the moment, when faced with an incredibly stupid and selfish coworker. It didn't matter that the coworker was in the wrong. It only mattered that their story to HR sounded better. People were actively warned about these people and nights when they were on were pretty tense. Since staffing was always an issue and they never did anything that would result in them being outright fired, they were never let go.   \n\n\nHR is there to protect the hospital, not OP. If the coworker and charge nurse were to contact HR first, they can and absolutely will spin a version that will portray OP as essentially Satan and make the coworker seem as innocent as a newborn lamb. \n\nIs it right that OP has to be super careful and watch his words? No, but unfortunately that's kind of the way it is sometimes. There are a lot of situations where the stupid and awful people came out on top because they either knew someone or they knew how to phrase their story so they came out as the victim.", "We are talking about taking a reasonable step to mitigate risk where it can be controlled. \n\nNot bringing in something that could seriously hurt or kill a coworker isn't hard.", "The co-worker in question apparently works in a hospital. If they can't be exposed to seafood, it's best that they not work where seafood may be on, or in, a member of the public. Yes, they may be able to get treatment for an allergic reaction very quickly. But should they put themselves in that kind of risk?\n\nIt's highly doubtful that her allergy is as severe as she's making it out to be. I'm curious if she's provided medical documentation to her about this allergy. If she hasn't, she needs to. It doesn't matter if it's negligible, mild, severe, or life threatening. Without a Dr's note, the company can probably either put any liability on her, or be at liability risk for letting her work with that allergy hanging over them.\n\nIt's possible she may have outgrown her allergy. Or that it's decreased in severity over the years. You gotta remember, our bodies basically renew every seven years, over time. She could also have been allergic to something else, and reacted to that, but thought it was seafood. Or may just hate seafood. Without an allergy test though, there's no way to know for sure. And if she thinks she's allergic, mind over body could cause a \"false\" positive.", "It would be great if they worked in home but they do not. This is not a random thing. This is like you having a peanut allergy and me buying Thai food. I am putting them at risk.", "I\u2019m in the US and they give out epi pens for allergies just in case. It\u2019s better to have them on hand in case it becomes anaphylactic. Her first reaction was hives in her body. However 19 years later she can\u2019t be in a room with nuts", "Here in the US, we pay through the nose for them. So they will write anyone a prescription for one because we have to foot the bill for it.", "Seafood is a common one to cause anaphylaxis so any allergy would have likely resulted in an Epi-pen script.  You can also get blood testing that will tell you what components you are allergic to.  Some result in anaphylaxis while others are mild.

But I didn\u2019t order food from this restaurant with her allergies even in mind at all, honestly. I was just thinking, I\u2019m hungry and this is my favorite restaurant. You created and stated a lot of assumptions about my thoughts and I corrected you. And now you feel mislead because you were wrong. Lol okaaaayyyyyyyy", "She could be then exposed to by a patient. What if they vomit on her? It's the patient's fault then? If it's so severe she should then work from home in something that's gonna keep shellfish out of her world.", "I said I work 36-72 hours/week. That means I at least work 3 shifts per week. At least 36hours/week. Overtime starts at 4 shifts. Anything over 36hours. Hope that clears it up, friend", "36 hours is full time. Anything over 40 is overtime. Part time is under 36.", "Peak capitalism brain.", "I worked a part time job(in the US) and anything over 5 hours on a given day was overtime(1.5*hourly). Full benefits and pension also(union job).

Most employers use an eight-hour day and a 40-hour workweek to identify a full-time position.", "Dude, I'm the one defending you. Basically saying that I agree you are full time because some jobs pay you for meal time, and unfortunately, some don't.", "HR will first ask if the allergy is on record.  If it\u2019s not this is not the thing to report because everyone is at risk.  Mostly allergy lady who has been getting to control food choices for an entire unit.  \n\nYou\u2019re not wrong about the toeing thing.  Working on that in my own unit atm", "Two things to that:\n\n1. The commenter I replied to indicated that there are people out there who have such severe allergies that that cannot be in the same space as an allergen.  I don\u2019t disagree but a person with such a severe allergy is unlikely to work in a hospital where the risk of random exposure is extremely high. \n\n2.  OP indicates they \u201coften accommodate\u201d the allergic persons needs.  The use of often indicates they do not always do so.  This indicates that they have in fact ordered allergens in the past.  What this tells me is the allergic person was complaining not due to allergens as much as due to not getting to choose where to eat.  It was not a company provided meal so the individuals involved have the option to order their own meals of their choice.  Some chose to order from a sports bar that also sells seafood.", "If she feels she can't be around seafood at all she needs to go to HR and get accomodations. Not just demand people don't eat food due to her allergy, yet she doesn't even carry an epi pen. That's absurd.", "Hospital break rooms are used by many people so while there may be allergen free break room spaces in the facility that doesn\u2019t mean there will never be an instance where a patient has the allergen.  Basically it is a reasonable expectation that seafood or peanuts might be present because patients can bring in their own food and may have consumed an allergen prior to arrival.  Care is not denied because of these things.", "The order in which you tell the story makes it sound like you thought she had an epipen up until she told you otherwise. I wouldn\u2019t have judged you for your willingness to use up her medical supplies if you\u2019d been clearer about that. I think it would have worked in your favor, honestly.", "I never said I agree with this structure. I was simply trying to understand how 36 hours a week is considered to be overtime.", "That makes sense as a part-time definition of work, from what I'm familiar with.", "Yes, I know I was just making a whimsy, kinda joking. The tone probably didn\u2019t come off well. Reddit doesn\u2019t like when I use emojis lol", "That's a good point. I'm assuming that it's likely on record since she has a pen, albeit one that's expired. Depending on the type of hospital and system, she may work at a place that has a clinic setup and an employee pharmacy. If that's the case, then it would likely be on record. I could see her saying that she told the charge nurse and using the area previously avoiding shellfish in her favor, though. \n\nBut I'm admittedly skittish about stuff like that.", "I agree she's just being grumpy she doesn't get to pick the restaurant she likes, but ordering herself would mean she'd had to pay the delivery and tip entirely herself making it too expensive.

I just knew we were in a hospital and there are \u201cepipens everywhere\u201d I didn\u2019t assume or not assume she had one. But the fact that she personally disclosed she needs an epipen but doesn\u2019t carry one and hasn\u2019t replaced her expired one. I just don\u2019t really think I need to make her allergies a priority if they aren\u2019t as big a priority to her.", "They said their work week varies between 36 and 72 hours per week, and they often work overtime.
