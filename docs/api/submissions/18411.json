We have always had a lot in common and similar interests. I love when we spend time together because it is always great and he\u2019s the only person that knows me like the back of his hand and me the same to him. \n\nSo for about 6 months I had to travel for work (I am a freelance model) and we hadn\u2019t spoken as much. Over that time he got a gf, and his gf 100% hates me and does not even want to meet me. He said that she talks bad about me and he insists that she stops. He said that she even insisted that he drop me but he said he refused to do so. She does not even allow him to like my posts on social media and the one time he did she swore up and down that \u201che thought I was sexy/he liked me\u201d. He showed me these messages in person. I think the way she acts is really weird and gross. \n\nI will give done back ground tho. In our early teens, he used to like me but I never felt the same. And a few years later we had kissed and we\u2019ve slept a in a bed together but never more than that. And that was years ago and even before college. I feel like we are completely platonic.\n\nShe also constantly brings up how I have never really had a boyfriend. Which I haven\u2019t, but I don\u2019t date at all. I just stay focused on work and don\u2019t really care for it. She acts like I\u2019m acting like he\u2019s my boyfriend when I\u2019m not. \n\nIt hurts me a lot that she is creating distance between us. All though I have other friends, he is for sure my best friend and almost a brother to me. I miss talking to him everyday and just being able to hang out and do stuff. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m asking for too much or over stepping. I never pressure him to go against her wishes because I don\u2019t want to push him away. \n\nI really want to be honest with him about his this makes me feel. This has been a common trend with his gfs, and I honestly am sick of it especially when all I want his my friend. I feel like it\u2019s just insecurity, and jealousy which is so common in women. One of his exes even said this explicitly so I know it\u2019s not crazy to think this.

He showed me these messages in person.'\n\n...ok, and why is he showing you all of this? He clearly doesn't want you and his gf to get along. Just think: she can't trust him to keep what she says between him and her. You sure he's 100% honest with you? Because I'm not; lord knows what he's saying to her about you. \n\nThe distance is your friend's fault: he is making these choices. If this is a common theme, ever thought he picks these kinds of relationships to make you jealous, put you in a position where you have to fight for him? I suspect at the very least these women are jealous because they're picking up that he is not over you.\n\n'I feel like it\u2019s just insecurity, and jealousy which is so common in women'\n\nIt's common in people.

It's a red flag to me that he's going back and forth between you and the girlfriend telling you all the things she said.", "I'm sure there's info missing from this story, but from what I can gather the only assholes is your boyfriend. Sounds like he's creating drama and exacerbating any issues that may genuinely exist.\n\nWhy's he running back to you telling you everything his gf has said about you? She probably thinks she's privately venting to her bf and had no intention of you finding out and making things awkward. It's normal for a couple to vent about things to their partner even if it's about something illogical or unfounded. Because that is meant to be your trusted safe space to do so. That's if she even said everything he's relayed... or in the correct context.\n\nHave you ever considered that if he's betraying her trust to you.... what is he saying to her about you? It's normal for a new gf to feel a bit insecure or jealous about their new bfs best female friend who's also a model... but to hate you without meeting you sounds a bit like the bf is stirring the pot. Whys he not encouraging you two meet, try and resolve things?\n\nYou said this is a recurring situation with his gfs. \nI have a sneaky suspicioun that your friend still has a crush on you and is trying to make you jealous or something. If not then he's either got bad taste in women... or the issue is you and you need to do some self reflection.\n\nAnyways...

Don't blame her for all of this. You can't expect to see him as often when he's dating someone. To be honest, you may not have romantic feelings for him but you do sound jealous that he's prioritizing her over you. So insulting her to your friend isn't going to make him change his mind about her. It will make him change his mind about you, and not in a good way.", "ESH. ( you and your friend )\n\nYou say best friend like brother.\n\nHe acts as if he is fixated on you and you are his girl friend. Otherwise why can't he have relationship private from you. He acts pathetic. \nNot all women are jealous  or insecure. If the same issue happened with all his exes, the real problem is him. And you deliberately turning a blind eye doesn't help....\n\nYou seem to have better than thou attitude and entitlement to a so called friendship that doesn't look healthy. Also are you insecure and jealous ?\n\n\n\nEdit: even if his GF was genuinely jealous and insecure, it will still make you two \"platonic friends\" AHs, because he is not trustworthy and you don't seem to understand on purpose. This makes even a sane person crazy.", "YTA. \"He's like a brother to me.\" You kiss your brothers? Your partner having a crush as a friend is unacceptable. The only reason he's not with you is cuz you rejected him and he still likes you. Why would the gf want her man hanging out with his crush? You never having a boyfriend either makes you look super sus.", "ESH, although I find the gf to be the least bad of you three. I think you and your friend love the drama.", "Ah yes, all the other women are jealous, because that's what women are like. \n\nThe only reason all his GFs have had this little problem is that he's trying to make you realise that you really want to be with him, but you don't like him that way.\n\nESH\n\n(except his GF, because she doesn't realise what's happening here)\n\nYou should call his bluff, bow out of the friendship and say you want this relationship to succeed. I will bet cash money that he will dump his GF immediately.\n\nBut you won't do that, because you like having this guy on a leash.", "The first thing that came to my mind is that this guy likes you. Stop being so naive. Your not the asshole but you should have seen this coming.", "\u2026 yeah he\u2019s trying to get you to date him.

He\u2019s telling you about it for a reason - because he wants a certain reaction and he wants you to question your feelings for him.", "Ya, right Jan.", "Nothing good can come of you voicing your concerns at this point.\n\nI don't know if it would make you an AH or not. But I do know it'd only end up blowing up on you.", "Wow! This guy needs a new best friend and girlfriend.  Uhhh, but that\u2019s not your self-serving question.  Welp, here it goes.  Leave it in his court.  Not unusual for friends new in a relationship to disappear for a bit.  If he has no interest in maintaining your friendship there\u2019s your answer.  Telling him negative things about a woman you haven\u2019t met, doesn\u2019t benefit you.  He is responsible for his behavior.  No one else.

You and your \u201cbest friend\u201d really need to practice some self awareness.\nSo let me get this straight. He had a crush on you. You guys even had bouts of physical affection ie kissing and cuddling in bed. But YOU didn\u2019t reciprocate his feelings. \nYOU THINK he doesn\u2019t have feelings for you anymore but literally everything you just typed out points the opposite direction. \nNow, he\u2019s airing out his gf\u2019s laundry and throwing gas on the fire by sending you screenshots of their private convos, instead of talking to his girlfriend about it and trying to work through their relationship. \nYou and your best friend are so immature. Either grow up and set some boundaries, or you two go ahead continue playing these stupid games with each other but don\u2019t get other people involved. \n\nSide note OP, why don\u2019t you try asking him genuinely if you reciprocated his feelings if he would be with you. Bet you the answer is yes. Or like the other comment said, see if he\u2019ll drop his gf for you and bet you he would ASAP.

You sound very \u201cpick Me\u201d right now with the whole \u201cwomen are so insecure and jealous\u201d.

I think theres a reason he dates a lot of jealous women; he still likes you and thats why theyre jealous.", "So, you are not the problem here but I don't think it's the crazy-ass gf, either.  Without a doubt, she's trying to control him and that never works out, but I think your friend is being shady as hell. First, *he's allowing this behavior*. He could stop it if he wanted to. Second, *he's showing you texts, between the two of them,* that are negative towards you. He's trying to make you feel some particular way towards her. Very manipulative. And finally, he's *admitted to romantic feelings for you in the past*, even if you don't reciprocate. He's hoping you will be jealous, and has probably made her jealous. He wants you to be fearful that she will push him to cut you off. In the meantime, he gets to pretend two women are \"fighting\" for him. \n\nDon't play this game, OP. You WBTA if you keep feeding his delusion.", "NTA. That girl sounds jealous insecure codependent and batshit insane. Tell him.\n\nHowever:\n\n>This has been a common trend with his gfs\n\nEither he has a questionable taste in women or there is something that worries them all.

You probably need some jealousy in a relationship. It's inevitable that his girlfriend will get jealous of a 21-year-old freelance model, whether or not she should. Hopefully you can all be good friends and he can reassure her that you're not going to cheat with him.
