I had to take out key info from my original post due to the character limit. I hope what I\u2019ve written makes sense. \n\nI\u2019m (26F) currently dealing with an issue between myself and one of my roommates \u201cYve\u201d (24F). We\u2019ve gotten along since she moved in 4 months ago. Our other roommate \u201cRiley\u201d (29F) is currently away visiting family so it\u2019s just me and Yve. Yesterday Yve came to me asking to talk and shared that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with my BF Travis (26M) coming to the house anymore. This was odd to me because she\u2019s had no issues until now and before she moved in I made sure she felt comfortable having a guy coming around or we wouldn\u2019t have brought her in as a roommate. I asked if something happened to make her feel uncomfortable, worrying he did something to bother her (not that I think he would but you never know). She said no he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong but still didn\u2019t want him at the house anymore. I pressed more because things weren\u2019t making sense and she finally told me that her parents found out from Yve\u2019s sister that I have a BF and they don\u2019t feel comfortable with their daughter living somewhere \u201cpremarital sex\u201d is taking place. They told her either he doesn\u2019t come to the house anymore or she needs to move out. \n\nI asked if she was being serious and she said she was. I told her I\u2019m sorry but your parents religious beliefs don\u2019t have a place in our home and I was surprised Yve was even going along with it (her parents do not live in our country and she does not practice their religion but pretends for appearance when she needs to). Yve replied that she\u2019s sorry but she feels uncomfortable with Travis coming over now and if I was a good roommate I would respect her wishes. I told her that it\u2019s not her that\u2019s uncomfortable it\u2019s her parents and I don\u2019t have to adhere to the religious beliefs of two random people that I don\u2019t know, especially when Yve doesn\u2019t follow the religion herself. Yve had no issue with Travis until her parents found out he came over. I wasn\u2019t even aware they weren\u2019t supposed to know. \n\nYve became angry and stated that if Travis wasn\u2019t going to stop coming over she would have to move out. I said that was fine and we would just find a new roommate. We haven\u2019t spoken since this conversation but when I brought it up with my Mom she felt I should have been more understanding. She said it must be difficult to have controlling religious parents and I should respect her wishes. I disagree and don\u2019t see how her parents religious beliefs should have any say in how adult women operate in their own homes. Yve is not on the lease it\u2019s just Riley and I so it\u2019s not like it would be breaking the lease if Yve left. \n\nSo AITA?

I'd tell her she's free to move out.", "NTA.  She knew the situation when she moved in and waited until the other roommate wasn't home to try and bulldoze you into complying with her demands.

If you let her get away with it, who knows what policy will await you when you return from an absence?", "NTA I\u2019m totally on your side here and think you said all the right things. Good luck with the room mate hunt, I hope you find a better one this time!", "NTA. She knew in advance you had a BF. She's an adult. It's not your fault she will not stand up to her parents.

You're all adults, and your roommate's parents have no right to control either her or you.", "NTA, its weird that you have to adhere to someone's else parents wishes when you are paying your rent and its your place. What you do in your place is upto you and if someone has an issue with it, they are better off moving out and finding somewhere else where they can practice their way of life. It all sounds too hypocritical anyway. Enjoy your life and don't give up your freedom for the sake of some random people who is still living in the last century.", "NTA. This is her issue not yours. If she doesn't like it, then she can leave.", "NTA! Those parents are not even there! How difficult it is to tell them there are no guys coming over? Do they have cameras installed in the house to check? Just ridiculous.. she didn't mind until now, so she has no right to demand now.", "YNTA.  Yve is a grown-ass woman. If she can't control her toxic Thumper parents, that's not your problem.  Your Mom's advice is bizarre.\n\nI pity Yve for being under the thumb of obviously deranged parents, but again, not your problem.  It is likely better to put distance between yourself and the cultists because they are often unpredictable.", "NTA, and not your problem. Let her leave.", "NTA.

It is for *her* to appease them or change their minds, not you. Your mother is plain wrong.

Like you said, she didnt had any issues before so try to see if you can bring back that. \n\n Try to cooperate with her, approach this like team work to fix the problem. Figure out solutions like why not lie to her parents. In case her parents come to visit, try not to invite your bf these days. I mean, work together towards your common goal. \n\nIf she cant be flexible in any regard, (I believe its her interest in remaining in the house, she surely has more to lose than you have here), then dont bother about this anymore and find a new roomate.", "I don't think your Mom is a bad person, I just think that advice is weird and, as a parent, I think it's bad advice.\n\nI can see her advising you to tell Yve to stand up to her nutball fanatic parents.  That would also be bad advice, but at least it would be better for Yve.  But to advise her (and you) to keep on enabling their garbage is the very worst advice I could imagine giving to a young woman trying to create her identity.  The way to deal with abusers is to draw strict boundaries and tell them they will observe them or be cut off.  Full stop.", "If ya\u2019ll were teenagers,I would feel a little sympathy for her, as I\u2019m sure shes been conditioned to follow her parents rules. But you guys are grown ass women, almost 30. \n\nThat\u2019s her problem if she wants to let her parents control her from a whole other country away."]}
