Yesterday Yve came to me asking to talk and shared that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with my BF Travis (26M) coming to the house anymore. This was odd to me because she\u2019s had no issues until now and before she moved in I made sure she felt comfortable having a guy coming around or we wouldn\u2019t have brought her in as a roommate. I asked if something happened to make her feel uncomfortable, worrying he did something to bother her (not that I think he would but you never know). She said no he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong but still didn\u2019t want him at the house anymore. I pressed more because things weren\u2019t making sense and she finally told me that her parents found out from Yve\u2019s sister that I have a BF and they don\u2019t feel comfortable with their daughter living somewhere \u201cpremarital sex\u201d is taking place. They told her either he doesn\u2019t come to the house anymore or she needs to move out. \n\nI asked if she was being serious and she said she was.

Yve replied that she\u2019s sorry but she feels uncomfortable with Travis coming over now and if I was a good roommate I would respect her wishes.

Clearly she lies about her lifestyle already, just tell parents that yes, you totally stopped having him over. \n\nYou are NTA btw, I just don\u2019t understand why she went straight to \u2018you can\u2019t have your bf over\u2019 instead of \u2018if you ever happen to speak to my parents can you pretend bf doesn\u2019t stay overnight?

It's so not a fair ask of her though.", "Your mom is an AH to guilt you for setting reasonable boundaries.", "Yve is very unlikely to find similar, young women looking for a roommate who don't have boyfriends.

I dont think is that easy to give up on your family because of this, Im not sure if Yve is even financially dependent on them either, so this is a tricky situation to navigate. \n\nOP isnt obliged to compromise here, but by her post it seems she cares about having a good environment with the people who she lives with.
