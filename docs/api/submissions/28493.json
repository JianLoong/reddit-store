Why do you have to buy dinner and clean 2 weekends in a row because he did what he was supposed to this time when you said there would be company.

It honestly sounds like you and husband have a great relationship, so kudos for that. The fact that he laughed it off means there is truly a great amount of love between you. Your sister does have a point though, even if her relationship ended badly and is likely taking out her own frustration onto you. With any luck, your husband got the point you were making and will make a point to do better on his lack of enthusiasm with cleaning.", "I think in this case they've worked out what they wanted to and OP was happy to pick up the next two weeks and dinner as a sorry/thank you. They've already moved on so as long as it's not a repeated thing everything is fine here. \n\nI personally would have been peeved though, but this isn't about me.", "Yeah, this definitely sounds like it should open the door for a real conversation.", "For me I do the same thing for only guests and this technique when I was more able bodied would work on me and I\u2019d actually be happy for it bc even if it\u2019s a lie I get to enjoy a nicer home without guests so I am the real winner.  \n\nSame if people tell me an event is earlier than it is.  Did they lie?  Sure but I also have time blindness and despite trying my best I will either arrive hrs way too early or some kind of late.  I know this, I don\u2019t like it as much as others don\u2019t and I\u2019m not mad if a little lie gets me more on time. \n\nI was late diagnosed adhd (late 30\u2019s) and the longer I went undiagnosed and untreated the harder it became to make myself clean even for guests. \n\nBut also telling a friend to randomly call and say they\u2019re coming over soon once a month or so is actually a technique I\u2019ve seen shared on social media to trigger a panic cleaning even if the friend never intended on coming over.  \n\nThe big thing here is consent is missing so maybe as long as the SO is okay with it OP can use this in the future if he\u2019s been slacking with the deep cleans.  Whatever works, so long as it\u2019s within reason and all parties can and do consent, I say go for it.  \n\nSometimes you need a little false panic to get the doing mundane things engine started.", "Sure, but it still doesn't necessarily make it right. I imagine there are plenty of people that could manipulate their spouse into thinking certain behaviors are okay, but that doesn't actually make it so.", "I\u2019m sure they do what is best for them! What works for you may not be what they want to do. Sounds like their way works but her husband needs a little more motivation when it\u2019s his turn.", "Well clearly it doesn't work if OP is resorting to tricking their partner into cleaning properly. My point was maybe they need to reassess how they do the housework in their house.", "I love that you've found a solution that helps support him where he's lacking. The us vs problem is just lovely to see"]}
