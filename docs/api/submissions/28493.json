I felt so bad.\nHe actually doubled over laughing and said \u201cWell damn, that worked didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nI apologized but he was still laughing.

But why do you have to trick and badger him to do what he's supposed to? Why do you have to buy dinner and clean 2 weekends in a row because he did what he was supposed to this time when you said there would be company. This is a weaponized incompetence situation and unless he starts regularly pulling his weight resentment will build up.", "NTA Your husband know he\u2019s lazy when guests aren\u2019t expected and laughed about being tricked into doing a thorough job. It sound like you have a relationship that works for both. Enjoy the clean house!\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA. You are gaslighting him. Given his reaction, I suspect this is common for you.

She wants the tiles scrubbed all the time, which might indicate she has an issue. \n\nA much more clear indication of her problem is she manipulates him into doing it her way.  I will go forward with the assumption you side with her because she\u2019s a woman and you hate men.", "...You seem to be missing the point. This lie and the husband's reaction are neither part of gaslighting nor indicative of gaslighting.\n\nThe lie itself is not in conflict with his memory or senses, and while I understand the reasoning for why this manipulative lie is bad, the described circumstances also give reasons that many people may consider sufficient for why it could be considered reasonable and necessary.\n\nI'm not saying that I agree that those reasons are sufficient, but I am certain that a great many people would honestly believe that they are, and the husband's reaction means nothing more than that he is one of those people.", "Did you even read her post? \n\nI hate slobby people who expect to do bare minimum, leaving junk food wrappers on the table, and expect their partner to make the effort.\n\nIt just so happens that usually that is the man.", "I\u2019m not sure you did. It\u2019s clear there is a disparity, but why do you believe he is the problem. If he is cleaning the house sufficiently but she has some sort of expectation that every square inch must be scrubbed, that\u2019s a problem for her to address.", "Where does she state that her expectation is that every square inch must be scrubbed?\n\nShe didn't\n\nShe just wants him to dust and wipe counters, clean tile and do laundry.  This is stuff that must get done on a regular basis.  Why is he exempt from these tasks and it's only her responsibility?"]}
