NTA", "NTA. She's probably having ptsd due to what happened to her. She probably also feels guilt that she didn't stand up for her rights, but that was unheard of back then. She really needs therapy. Maybe your hubs could talk to her one on one. She probably does feel like having her grandchild \"limited\" (her feelings not mine) is the same as her child being ripped from her... But that's a mental health reaction to what happened. She definitely needs therapy and id wait until the child is older and can talk before allowing much more contact. MIL needs to understand this isn't a punishment... But she's mentally unwell and could be dangerous. She might not feel she is... But mental health issues can take over at the drop of a hat.", "NTA\nyou are new to parenting and you'd definitely take extra measures/precautions to safeguard your child. Your MIL has gone through a traumatic experience and i feel sorry for her, but that doesn't justify her sleeping over at your house and claiming that it is her child that was taken away decades ago. \n\nYou're lucky that you and your husband are on the same page and I think that letting your MIL sleep @ your house might be risky for you dont know what she might do with the baby when you guys are asleep, considering that she's depressed and drunk most of the time", "NTA. Your first priority is that baby. It is not on you to heal past wounds of your MIL, especially at the most stressful time in your life. I\u2019d let her know that I\u2019d love her to be in her grandsons life, but set very clear boundaries such as she has to be sober to see the baby. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nYour priority is your baby, not your MIL\u2019s feelings. \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable with her staying over, then she doesn\u2019t.
