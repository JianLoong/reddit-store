The fact that you didn't invite her to your wedding is so rude and disrespectful, not even just to her, but to your father. I know you said in a comment that it was immediate family only, but that doesn't matter. Your father is immediate family and she is married to him. It is incredibly rude to invite one half of a couple, especially one that has been together for 17 years. It would be one thing if you didn't invite his brand new squeeze, but this woman has been around for 17 years. \n\nYou keep saying that your stepmom is a nice person, and you don't have any problem with her, but you are treating her very poorly.

Your father skipped your wedding because you disrespected his wife, and you didn't seem to care. Your brother has now told you that he's going to cut you out of his life if you don't accept your stepmom, and again you don't seem to care.

Sounds like there is zero reason for your hostility. Basic rules of etiquette would be to invite her along with your father. Your family is well rid of you if you keep this up.

Judging from your words she has done nothing more than respect your decisions. \n\nNow, your brother shouldn't force you to have a mother/son relationship with her, so he's also not in the right here, but I kinda understand his frustration since you clearly need to grow the f up and treat your stepmom better.", "You sound like you\u2019re an absolute treat to be around\u2026Your Dad, Step Mother and Brother are all probably better off without you in their life, cause it sure doesn\u2019t sound like you give a single fuck about any of them.

Did you just wanted your dad to live alone for the rest of his life? They have been married for almost a decade and a half, you man not want to accept it but the bottom line is: she IS apart of the family\n\nAll I can say OP is that your family will end up excluding you and your wife because of this.

Whether you like it or not shes married to your dad, has been for what im assuming is over a decade, is a main part of your immediate family and you wont include her in any part of your life. If she was abusive to you i'd understand but from what it sounds like she respects boundaries and you, and adult, cant be bothered to accept your step-mom/chosen mother to your brother. Again i'd understand if you chose not to have her in the wedding but to not invite her at all? I'm assuming that through your father she'd be involved in your future child's life regardless.

The more normalized the \u201cnew\u201d family became\u2026 the more closed off to it\u2026 and the \u201cthreat\u201d from her grew.

You are costing your child to be uncles, grandfathers, loving relationships with people that either love you, or love those you at least maybe used to love. Making peace with being around the person who helped your father and brother grieve is not disloyal to your mom.

Not caring that his Father misses his wedding because he can\u2019t bring himself to let his SM attend, is a whole other thing.  And not caring that his brother just went no contact with him\u2026.OP has some issues and should definitely seek help.  So if OP ever actually does have children, is he going to spank them or go no contact with his Father if the children ever dare to call this woman \u201cgrandma\u201d?", "Well, i srill find him cruel. Sure its his choicex his choice to be cruel to a woman who did nothing wrongy but is treated like dust.", "You know you didn't invent having a dead mother, right? You sound like someone who needs a lot of help moving on from where you are with your grief.\n\nAnd as for \n\n> How would you know what my mother would think of me asshole?\n\nWell she loved your father presumably, and I'd imagine she'd be sad that her son was cutting off her husband in order to try and score points against someone else who has done nothing wrong.", "well.  I'm a mother\n\nand if my child acted like you are? I'd be ashamed. \n\nMaybe she'd be all for you acting like a spoiled brat, who knows?", "Welly she probably really would. Any decent humna being would be ashamed of their son who acts like you do. You are totally acting like a little child, you know? Whatever, your choice, yku are gonna lose the rest of your remaining family, and that will be your own fault, dont even think blaming them later on. And you are gpnna deprive your kids of an uncle and geandfather and a kind step granny.", "This person has never met the OP's mother and made a horrible comment saying that his mother would be ashamed just because he didn't want his stepmother in his life and y'all are upset because he didn't like it???? Well, surprise, of course he didn't like it! Who makes that kind of comment about someone's dead mother, for god's sake", "Because she's the mom to your little brother and your dad's wife, and she has probably performed thousands of kind things for you, and you're treating her like garbage. And you owe her respect! Grow the fuck up and don't have kids. Or do have kids, and realize how much you've taken this woman for granted.", "There\u2019s a good chance many of us are mothers of adult children and we wouldn\u2019t want our sons to make a life long career of deliberately excluding someone for no reason- someone they describe themselves as a perfectly nice person- because we care about our sons too much to sit back and watch that happen. We wouldn\u2019t think our son was an asshole, but we\u2019d worry.", "I think I understand your sentiment and I don\u2019t think you should be getting all the criticism.  IMO your dad remarried way too soon, especially in light of his kids, especially you.  Of the three of you, you had it the hardest by far, and not really by choice. I\u2019m surprised your brother can\u2019t empathize more.  Did your mom have any family you could reach out to?  I think family is important and it might be comforting to be around people who remember your mom and might be grieving just as you are.", "Including his wife!\n\n\\*banjos playing in background\\*", "I think the difference is the brother expects op to think of step mom as mom. Op even mentioned brother referring to her as their mom", "u/Mediocre_Radish2252 stole this comment \n\n[link to original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jwnvs/aita_for_not_including_my_stepmother_in_my_life/j5n3oqh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)", "I mean, I'm not sure that the dad deserves any resentment either. Sure, a year is pretty fast to remarry, but it's not crazy. Any \"resentment\" would still be based in the fact that the stepmom would be, in OP's mind, replacing his mother and a reminder that his mother was gone. (Imo anyway - I have zero psyche degrees to my name).", "I think you\u2019re spot on.  My first thought was his dad remarried only a year after his wife died, the mother of his two kids?  That\u2019s so weird, especially because of the kids, the older son didn\u2019t even get a full year to grieve before he had to get ready for his dads wedding?  \n\nI know that this is on the dad not the step mom, however OP has no other parent, so I get why he doesn\u2019t want to blame his dad and instead goes for the step mom.  Man that\u2019s hard.  I\u2019m sorry the brother can\u2019t see how hard this must be for OP\u2026", "I dunno, his brother was 5? when mum passed, that's old enough to remember her.   \nAgree with the resentment though, I'd be feeling like dad replaced mum with a \"new mum\"  if it were me.   \nBut for sure not including her in family events isn't fair, she is dad's wife and deserves at least a +1 invites (invite dad, and it's implied wife is included in the invite).", "Doesn\u2019t that make the dad the asshole??? How is it her fault?", "That's the father's responsibility, not hers", "NTA. Some kids resent having a parent bring a new spouse into their lives and expect the kid to be ok with the situation or even treat that person like a parent. You can't force a kid to feel good about the situation. Clearly, this has had a negative impact on OP for years so now that he can distance himself from that person, he does so. Doesn't matter if the dad's wife is good, bad, or indifferent. The damage was done years ago. OP forcing himself to interact with his dad's wife isn't going to change how he feels, so why pretend everything is ok when clearly it isn't?\n\nI think it would be helpful to OP ro speak to a mental health therapist to explore why it is, if he has no resentment towards his dad's wife, he wants to exclude her from all family events. I think there's a disconnect there.", "I think the years have only added to the resentment. I thinking losing a mom, then having a stepmom a year later would be hard at any age. But having it happen at such a young age with likely no therapy to help him deal, might be why he seems detached. It might be his way of coping with a painful loss", "From his dad remarrying a year after his first wife died. Unless this was some whirlwind romance, where they got married after dating for a week, OP's dad was going out with the step-mother shortly after mum passed away. OP is absolutely taking it out on the wrong person, but I don't see the resentment itself as surprising, rather as sad.\n\nAs an aside, I have never seen people with kids remarrying quickly go well and it always feels inconsiderate to the kids, especially if they aren't babies. My uncle wrecked his family that way, now 2\\3 of his kids don't talk to him", "Really? Tell me all about her since you're clearly clued in.", "How do you know she was a beautiful person?", "Dude. You're acting like he murdered someone. He doesn't want her in his life and any reason including no reason at all is good enough. Either you believe people should be able to choose who they want to share their lives and important moments with or you don't and it really sounds like you don't. Sounds like the woman is a basically stranger to him. Why is it so shameful that he didn't invite her to his own intimate- *close* family only wedding. They aren't close. If the grandfather and brother choose not to be in OP's kids life that's their choice. Don't you think it's weird you believe they have the right to make the decision and if they do it's OP's fault but you don't think OP has the right to choose to not have his dad's wife in his life? Would it really have been better to look at his wedding photos to see all the close family he loves and then the +1 he didn't want there? Shouldn't he and his fiance be the only ones to decide on their wedding day how they want to spend it and who they want to spend it with? Apparently not. Apparently what other people want matters more even on his and his fiance's day. That's what I'm getting from these responses. Apparently the only *legitimate* reason to not want someone in your life is if they are evil incarnate otherwise what you want doesn't matter so you better invite them to your wedding or suddenly you yourself are the devil incarnate for wanting the people you actually like at your wedding.", "He is punishing her for his father moving on too fast. He is taking it out on the wrong person.", "Yeah, I can get it there's unresolved resentment there, but he's not admitting to it (at least not in the post) and just kinda trying to ignore that she exists is pretty childish to keep doing at this point.", "I think as the years passed, the resentment kept building. It also sounds like the brother has made it worse, by referring to her as  their mom. It\u2019s sad, but maybe NC or low contact is best for everyone at this point", "It's hard but it's also at least partially on him to face those feelings and start to deal with them. Especially since the hurt there would really be more between him and the dad. It feels kind of like he's trying to punish them both by not including her?", "It\u2019s not that weird in reality. Grief is different for everyone and it\u2019s quite common for people to remarry quite fast after losing their spouse.", "OP was NTA at 10, but not self reflecting or seeking therapy for 17 years is pushing him further towards TA. I know firsthand that grief is a terrible thing, especially when not handled correctly at a young age, but there is a point where you can't just take it out on those around you. And that's not too say the dad and/or step-mom aren't potentially also assholes here, but that's going to depend on a dialogue OP isn't allowing to happen right now.", "I agree with this. \n\nI also think Dad remarrying within a year didn\u2019t give OP enough time to grieve his mom\u2019s passing, and feeling as if Dad just replaced Mom without much care for her. \n\nI don\u2019t think we can expect children to handle death the same way adults do. So whereas Dad can lose a partner and may be able to move on within a year, asking a child to be done grieving and ready to accept a new \u201cmom\u201d is hard. \n\nEspecially if everyone is accepting and embracing the new mom (stepmom, dad, and brother), he might have felt no one cared that he was still grieving.", "Men seem to remarry quickly after their wife dies. Its like they cant be alone. Women in the other hand often stay single... its like they prefer being alone", "Dude, stop arguing. You know YTA. Everyone has pointed it out. Get some real help because this is not healthy", "You might not consider family, but she is your fathers wife and an important person to your brother. This extreme treatment of her shows absolutely no respect to your father and brother. Why do you appear to resent her more than you love them? If you truly cared for you father and brother you\u2019d be a little more tolerant having her around sometimes. \n\nHer being at family get togethers sometimes doesn\u2019t mean you need to accept her as your mother, you\u2019re 27, that ship has sailed. But you do still have a father and brother, and if you\u2019re not careful they\u2019ll be gone too. You\u2019re cutting off your nose to spite your face.", "Is it really that interesting in a thread so incredibly soaked in mommy issues?", "Bro, you can choose to not have a deep relationship with somebody but she is family as much as his wife is family to his brother and father.\n\nAs much family as any aunt was etc.", "This. All day long. That is what it definitely is. He was offended at 10 that this woman was in his mommy's place and has never let it go. 17 years of animosity is crazy.", "On reflection it's almost very sadly predictable. I think having come back to this thread after a bit, I'm just sad for OP."]}
