I know you said in a comment that it was immediate family only, but that doesn't matter. Your father is immediate family and she is married to him. It is incredibly rude to invite one half of a couple, especially one that has been together for 17 years.

Mind boggling.", "You don\u2019t say if she\u2019s been cruel, overstepping boundaries or acting entitled in any way shape or form. Your reasoning for cutting her out is nonexistent.

She\u2019s been in your life for 17years, and you\u2019re treating her like she\u2019s a nobody.", "NTA it\u2019s your life and she is only your stepmother, she has no right to be called grandmother or anything of that sort.", "Reluctantly YTA. I have immense step-parent hang ups too, I try to only visit my mom when her husband isn\u2019t there, but he\u2019s her family, so if I\u2019m hosting an event, he\u2019s still invited. He\u2019ll never be my father or anything to me emotionally, besides irritating, but sometimes you have to suck it up and be an adult.\n\nEdit: fixed typo", "YTA you don't consider her your mom, okay fine it's difficult to accept someone else as your mom but you don't even give her basic respect. Could have invited her as a guest in your wedding and what's wrong in inviting her in gatherings. It's not like inviting someone just automatically makes them your mom. You are punishing her for crimes that she never committed. OP you are purposely ruining your relationship with your dad and brother, there will come a time when you will need them emotionally, financially that time don't expect them to be with you.", "YTA. It's fine that you don't consider her your mother; you're certainly not obligated to see her as family, but you write that she's polite and respects boundaries and hasn't done anything overtly mean, yet you purposefully exclude her from events to the point that it's insulting.   \n\n\nWhy can't you treat her like your father's wife and your brother's mother? Purposefully excluding her from your wedding looks like you're trying to send a message. Purposefully excluding her from all the major events and milestones you celebrate is also purposefully sending a message.   \n\n\nI'm on your brother's side. Your exclusion just seems mean. Is there something missing? Did something happen that makes you feel uncomfortable in her presence? So far, it just looks like you're trying to be hurtful.", "NTA", "You said yourself she\u2019s a nice person. You sound very resentful, which is understandable since your father moved on so quickly but unless your stepmom has not been good to you I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t invite her to your wedding or family events. She doesn\u2019t have to be your mom to be in your life or to be considered family.", "I don't dislike her, I just don't consider her family.", "Curious with the same questions.

It's so wildly unreasonable.", "As long as he\u2019s fine when everyone cuts him off for purposely excluding her, then yes keep your boundaries. She\u2019s not his blood family I agree, but she is his dads wife.

Why he is ok with doing this consciously to his brother and father is beyond me.", "Yeah if there\u2019s nothing specific she did then YTA. You\u2019re treating her like a pariah not like a neutral.  You felt so strongly about this that you were willing for your dad to miss your wedding instead of her being his plus one. That\u2019s hate. She clearly has earned your brother\u2019s affection and she has been married to your dad for fifteen years so it seems like she\u2019s in this for the long haul. If hating her so much that you want to alienate your whole family is worth it to you then so be it.

It seems like you\u2019re intentionally trying to hurt your father and your brother. Do you really expect them to exclude this person whom THEY consider family and keep things cordial? Your behavior sounds mean and spiteful, but for no reason at least none you\u2019ve given. YTA", "You clearly dislike her, you're not even behaving in a civil way towards her. She isn't your mom, but she is family and if she hasn't been cruel or abusive, why are you?", "grow up, and listen to the shovel.... there is wisdom here", "Was everyone who attended your wedding blood related to you? No spouses were invited? No aunts or uncles by marriage?", "Lmao this further makes me question where this resentment comes from. She gave up on trying to a mother figure to you after you turned 13 and you still act like this towards her?", "There's a huge difference between \"not considering someone family\" and \"not giving your own father a +1 to your wedding.\"", "But your dad didn't come to your wedding because you didn't invite his wife of 15 years. There's a problem. More than one. YTA", "Would your brothers wife be family? When your kids get married will their spouses be family? She\u2019s your Dad\u2019s wife. That doesn\u2019t warrant a birthday invite? Seriously, why are you okay hurting your brother and father like this? She\u2019s not your Mom, everyone gets it.", "So if your brother didn't invite your wife to his wedding, because it was \"immediate family\" only, you'd think that was normal? If your in-laws don't invite you to family dinner just because you don't share their DNA and are therefore not their \"family,\" are you and your wife cool with that?", "She *is* immediate family. She is your dad\u2019s wife - and has been for nearly two decades. And unless she has been mean, manipulative or toxic (or there is some other prior background to her relationship with your dad), it\u2019s you who comes across as immature and petty. I get that you may have been mad at your dad for moving on fast (or, like, at all), maybe even at your brother for substituting your mom - and so you probably feel you need to hold on to your beliefs and principles even tighter. But that was a ten-year-old you. Now, you are married - planning to be a father. Relationships are complicated, life is tough, (even blood) families are not always perfect - if you got lucky enough to get a good harmless soul for a stepmom, do the least necessary and include your dad (as a couple) in your life. Your kids can find some generic nickname for her instead of calling her granny.\nI hope you don\u2019t alienate your brother over this and find a way back to your ~~dad~~ birth family. Peace and light.", "Were other spouses there?", "She doesn\u2019t really have the right to be in his life, I don\u2019t blame him. Although purposely leaving her out is definitely going to be something he\u2019ll have to live with. He is also cutting out his dad because he\u2019s choosing to stand by his wife ( which I support. It\u2019s AH behavior sure, but he\u2019s not an AH for wanting her to not be called grandma with his child.", "I didn\u2019t get enough details about op wedding. Did they only do main people intimate wedding or did they have a big one. Regardless or not op didn\u2019t hold that against his dad choosing not to come. Is it disrespectful towards their relationship not to invite yes it is. However its op wedding and can choose who to invite. However can\u2019t be upset if someone chooses not come due to someone else not being invited.", "Facts. I refuse to believe OP has nothing against her if he is so willing to exclude her from everything that he was ok with his own dad missing his wedding because of it. I wonder where this resentment comes from", "What\u2019s the significance in stating she is OP\u2019s father\u2019s wife? That\u2019s obvious already\u2026.", "Why would you? Lol. You\u2019re not supposed to invite them to the wedding if you don\u2019t want to. Clearly OP didn\u2019t want to.", "Or you own wife for that matter? How would you feel if your relatives excluded your wife because she wasn\u2019t their family?", "Not MY family and I wouldn't complain if she didn't want me around based on that.", "I agree with you on the last bit, but OP is miles from anyone thinking he\u2019s going to allow that. He states that she\u2019s a nice person and she obviously is loved by his closest family members. The intentional strife that he is causing is the behavior I consider AH-ish, and he did ask\u2026 \ud83d\ude03", "After 15 years of mariage with his dad, whom I assumed he loves, he should at least see her as de facto family adjacent. While she doesn\u2019t need to be named grandma, I think the whole exclusion of her specifically means that he will eventually be the one excluded. \n\nFunny thing about when someone marries a person you love, they are a package deal with their spouse. If you exclude the spouse, you exclude the person you love. So in this case, OP better be ready to only have his wife and future children as his family. His father and brother will eventually leave too.\n\nHis choices have consequences too.", "So whenever your brother and father have a family celebration or whatever they should invite you but not your wife right? Because she's not their family?\n\nAnd when you have a child he will be invited but you'll have to leave mommy behind since she's not their family?\n\nAnd you will be Ok with all of that? Or do you think you or your wife might be a little bit upset about that?", "If you want to limit yourself to only having such a narrow view of family, that's your choice. It may end up being very lonely, though, when several of them drop you for your choices.", "So, your brother\u2019s partner/SO isn\u2019t invited to your family events either? What about your wife\u2019s siblings and their SOs?", "Oh no I definitely agree he\u2019s definitely being a bad person and an AH but he doesn\u2019t owe anyone the title of grandmother of his baby. I don\u2019t think his actions are justified and I think they\u2019re really hurting his relationship with his father and brother and his step mother all together"]}
