Im in the car 6+ hours a day with random people daily. I work for a family business that is relatively small. (Under 30 employees) My \u201cboss\u201d is the founders daughter, I went to HS with her. \n\nThe president of the company\u2019s philosophy is that if you\u2019re not throwing up constantly- you can work. Even then, if you do feel nauseous, have the student pull over, open your door, puke, & keep on teaching!\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026So they\u2019re not very lenient on sick days. \n\nI woke up last Thursday with an excruciating headache, sore throat & body aches so bad it felt like a student driver hit me w a car. I assumed strep.\n\nCalled in for work around 7am, boss told me to get some rest that morning & if I\u2019m feeling better, let them know bc we had a lot of students needing lessons that evening. Fair. I told her that wouldn\u2019t happen bc of how miserable I had been feeling. \n\nFriday my symptoms were getting worse. I decided to go to an urgent care bc my PCP couldn\u2019t get me in for a few days. They did their thing- swabbed for Covid, flu, strep. All negative. They didn\u2019t have an answer for me, but they did get me a note excusing me from work until Tuesday. \n\n\nI sent a picture of the doctors note in a group text with my boss & his daughter excusing me from work until Tuesday (sep5). Daughter responded and said she would have me off the following day (Saturday). \n\nI responded: \u201cNot until the 5th? Look, I know it's inconvenient. We have a lot of students and I need the money but I won't be working until the 5th. I can't really explain how miserable I feel. Yes, somethings going around with school starting but I can't even take care of my daughter, she\u2019s staying with my mother, let alone teach people how to drive\u201d\n\nCEO didn\u2019t mind, just wanted me to get feeling better. He\u2019s great. His daughter however, private messaged me a voice memo. Here it is transcribed: \n\n\u201cHey, I have done so much for you and have been so helpful. I have donated things to you. I have supported you financially as a friend and been there for you and your daughter. I don't know what else I can do to help you. \nI don't appreciate you being rude. I understand you feel bad right now, but I didn't even read the paper that said through the fifth. \nYou told me you went to the hospital, the ER or wherever and that's all I need to know. I don't need you to send a paper showing that you don't work until the fifth. I didn't even read it because I trust in what you say and I know if you can't come to work, then you can't come to work, but you have to tell me that. \n\nSo be kind because kindness goes a long way.\u201d\n\nYes, she\u2019s donated baby items her kids grew out of for my 6 month old. As a single momma, it\u2019s very appreciated but I didn\u2019t ask/beg for them. \u201cFinancially\u201d as a friend she gave me a $100 bill for groceries once before payday like 2 months ago & I didn\u2019t even use it. I gave the bill back the next day! \n\nIf you read the whole thing- thank you! My goodness.

I've worked for someone like this.  I was driving across the country, moving back to where we went to school (2 10-hour days of driving).  I was feeling sick after a few hours of driving the first day, so we stopped early.  She told me I'd better be there for my first day of work (day after I would have originally arrived) of I was fired.  This person was supposed to be my BFF.....  I made it there (driving 16 hours on day 2) and was miserable for my first day.  I understand it being a small business, but we're all human as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater I missed a shift and she told me I couldn't do that.

I don't know how she gets through doorways with that ego. \na) She can't bear being called out on a mistake so she tries to pin it on you\nb) She frantically tries to reposition herself as Lady Bountiful to Grateful Peasant, instead of a manager who made a mistake with an ill employee. \n\nSounds like it's Very Very Important to her to be right and superior.\n\nI'd eyeroll, make mental notes that that's her shtick, and go forward bearing her personality in mind.", "NTA.\n\nKeep a paper trail of these things, always.
