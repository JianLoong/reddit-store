How many parents will say their kids are little angels to get aunts/uncles to baby sit for the latter to find out the kids are a real handful when the parents are out on their date night with their phone on silent? How many people say their dog is potty trained when they ask a friend to watch their dog to only find out when the owner is gone the dog shits mostly in the house?\n\nI do agree that if OP really wanted to make this work, there are ways to reduce the risk, like you say, a fresh diaper, putting down plastic, going for a short ride. But I feel that it's up to the owner of the car to decide if they want to take this risk even if it's greatly reduced.\n\nSecondly, the child is known for head banging and kicking.
