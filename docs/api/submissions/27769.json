You have every right to want to protect an expensive item from getting damaged by a child who you don\u2019t trust to not damage it. That\u2019s reasonable.  \n\nOne additional thought. Maybe you should have told her yes as long as she was willing to put a $2000 deposit down first to cover any potential damages. My guess is that would have shut her up quickly.

One ride will turn into more. You know I know and OP def knows it because he's likely seen and dealt with a ton of her shit. \n\nNext, the OP talked about this kids stimming. Stimming isn't always cute little hand flapping, it can be bigger movements, jerkier movements, full body spasmy type movement. Stimming can be worse in strange places and vehicles. This is an unfamiliar car to this kid, it will be stressed and unable to use healthy self regulating skills\n\nNext also, it's this dude's car. He bought and sunk money into it. It's new and he's allowed to take pride in it regardless. So he decides who and what goes in it and what is allowed while in it such as eating and drinking. He says no, it's fucking NO.  You can do what you want and who you all want in your own damn cars and deal with consequences. \n\nThe aunt is an entitled h0 and prob got that way as a coping tool for the grief she has from having a differently abled child (this is a real thing by the way). Everyone suckered into it and didn't set boundaries and now she's a monster. The OP doesn't owe her or the kid shit.

It\u2019s your car and I am at a total loss why nobody seems to understand this.", "NTA no means no the first time.

He\u2019s still compulsive and does things like rock himself really hard and will dent the wall with the back of the recliner, he\u2019s obsessive and grabbed a drill one time and drilled holes in walls for no reason other than he had anxiety and felt like it. He fidgets and breaks things, he can\u2019t control himself. No one outside his own mother and father would have taken him for a ride in a brand new vehicle because he would have pressed every button and treated everything roughly. \n\nAside from knowing the above, again it\u2019s your right to say no and your family should understand the word the first time it\u2019s said.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA.

He might be very excited or even stressed out in your new car so who knows, the risk of him having an accident might be higher, and in a car you can't just get up from the seat to go to a toilet or a changing facility, you might be miles away from a place where he could get changed.\n\nNTA.

It does get irritating, but with this kind of sensitive stuff it's probably best to deliver that kind of information when youre not under pressure.

Pinch pinch pinch. My mom got a new car. It wasn't super expensive or a luxury car, it was just a nice new car. Within 3 days, the upholstery had over 200 holes pinched into it.
