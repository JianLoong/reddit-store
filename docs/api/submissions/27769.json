Even if there's not physical damage, aesthetic damage in a special vehicle is a problem.  A few things that have been damaged in my cars are:\n\n* A girlfriend in high school \"balanced\" with her leg trying to get something out of the back seat of my car and kicked across the face of my stereo equalizer, bending and ripping some of the sliders off.\n\n* The passenger vent window in my '57 Chevy is \"flappy\" because of damage from passengers over the years pressing on it (sometimes rather hard) to either open it more or close it.  The thing is, those vent windows are operated by a crank handle just below the window, not by grabbing and pushing it, and the gearbox has gotten loose because of it.  Now I give specific instructions on how to operate them.\n\n* The inside door release handles in mid-80s BMWs are locked in place when the doors are locked, unlike many other cars which unlock the doors as you pull on the handle.  It's a known problem in enthusiast circles I've had door release handles broken on my 535i myself when passengers instinctively start grabbing at the handle to get out, then yank even harder because the handle \"isn't working.\"  Now I give specific instructions to not touch the handles before I have unlocked the car or the passengers have unlocked their door before using the handles.\n\n* Damaged door panels (or things on door panels like speaker grilles) from people sticking their foot out to hold the door from swinging closed when the car is facing uphill.  Toyotas seem to be especially bad for having ineffective door checks, and my girlfriend regularly uses her foot to keep the door on her Prius from swinging back, and the passenger door on a Camry I had got scuffed from passengers doing this.", "Lol same @ having way more patience for shite like this than I would.", "I mean\u2026 that\u2019s literally flat out not true.

That's wild.", "As someone with a very mild all things considered disability, people that pamper kids like that to the point of being that they are 'different' than other people are really annoying, like yea, life is different for everyone, some of us are gonna struggle more, and the world should be easier for everyone, but not getting bonus extra shit just because you have a disability and acting like you are OWED that shit is deplorable behavior and is a failure on her upbringing", "They have \u201cdiapers\u201d that look just like panties so there\u2019s no excuse for that", "Having worked in Exceptional Education, I concur.", "Having showered my 91-year old father in law with dementia twice in the last 18 hours, yes, a diaper is no guarantee.", "You may be right.....I may be crazy!......but it just might be a lunatic you're looking for!\n\nSorry, just wanted to sing a little William Joel.", "My dad went to pay his property taxes and it was $80 to swipe his card.

That's what I told her, but she refused because it would \"undo\" the potty training (which didn't work). She planned on taking the kid to the doctor *after they got home*. I've no idea why she thought lying to the school and allowing the kid to pee everywhere was a good idea, but that's her style of parenting/grandparenting. \n\nShe also got mad at me for giving the kid a spill proof cup, because it would \"make her think any cup she uses won't spill.\" And she objected to the Disney themed stool I left in the bathroom so the kid could use the toilet and reach the sink.
