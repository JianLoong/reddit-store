Not to mention there is no way your parents are hiding the squishy floor tile (which btw \\*PUKE\\*) and as soon as all that shit comes back (all the mold plus everything else you mentioned that they ARE going to find) then they will get dropped so fast and have wasted their money. let them learn the hard way", "NTA, but that\u2019s the sort of thing that would get picked up on inspection. Any prospective buyer would likely back out at that point because that\u2019s just A LOT to deal with.", "Frankly, you're better off by saying nothing and letting those idiots move to Hawaii.", "NTA, but maybe instead of informing the realtor inform the inspector in case you know who that is gonna be. Then it will be written in the official report and he can just pretend that he found it himself", "Depends on where you are. Many states don\u2019t require you to disclose anything. Buyer beware states. Some states are the opposite. \n\nAnd this is why you should always have a home inspection before buying. No matter what type of state you are in (assuming US).\n\nEdit: adding to say, I\u2019ve heard you may be liable for interfering with a contract or causing a contract to be nixed.", "NTA\n\nDefinitely tell the realtor. \n\nI suspect a competent inspector would find it, but it is still a major item to disclose, and they should not be trying to screw someone over with a major issue like this. \n\nAlso, I lived in Hawaii for 11 years. It\u2019s beautiful, but very expensive. They are not being smart at all if that is their plan.", "A home inspector should find all of this. I would think a buyer could figure out a home inspection contingency will discover this.", "Trust me. As someone who lived and performed in Hawaii for over 10 years, they will not be able to exist there on any of the islands. It is incredibly expensive. \n\nI also would think the realtor has to have inspections done before listing her property. \n\nDo what you think is right.", "NTA  I'd call the RE, your mother is playing with fire - she can be sued for this", "YWBTA, yes. \n\nThis is not your house, nor your business. Furthermore, no matter how you try to frame it, I do not believe your reasons for tattling are altruistic. You disagree with them moving to Hawaii, you do not want it to work out for them, and you want to stop them under the guise of \"concern.\"\n\nYeah, no. The realtor is not stupid, and will have an inspection done. Let the realtor and subsequent buyer worry about this. No need to be a snitch.", "I agree OP could/should call but like, no way the inspector isn't going to find every single thing OP mentioned and more. it's their entire job to find that shit and most of it is pretty obvious (hell half the house is being eaten byt he mold) so like no matter what, parents are not getting past that inspection and everything will fall through. like there is just absolutely no shot unless they happen to get an inspector that is just completely incompetent", "Some markets are so hot that buyers are forced to waive inspections just to have a chance with their offer.", "Realtor here. You can send most of them a text or find them on Facebook or Instagram. If you know who they used you can contact them. But they still have to put the price as what the owners want. But inspectors worth their salt will do a very good inspection. Plus most places require a wir. Wood infestation report. Those guys will crawl everywhere to make sure they don't miss anything.", "Personally I would let them do what they're doing. Because the inspector for the buyer will not miss it. There's no way that they could.\n\nSo your stepdad could end up with fraud charges if things got really crazy but at the very least have to pay what is likely an exorbitant amount of the sale in order to fix it before the sale will go through.\n\nTo me it's one of those things I would leave alone just so they learn the process and how they aren't going to get away with it.\n\nMy sister bought a house that had some relatively minor termite damage they tried to hide they ended up having to pay for the termite treatment and the preventative treatment on the rest of the property. It took a chunk out of their profit for sure (I think all of it actually). They even tried to back out of the sale and failed.", "I'm pretty sure a home inspection is a standard part of buying a house. I don't think this is going to go how they think it's going to go.", "Lol, is that what you are tellibg yourself to justify it?", "Agreed. Inspections are there to protect buyers. And that is not what you are actually doing, trying to protect a buyer. You are trying to sabotage your mother because you disagree with her plans. And for that I go against everyone here and think YTA. Finding a loophole to alleviate the guilt doesn't lessen the fact that this is all about you sabotaging your mother.", "In tight housing markets, people will waive their right to an inspection. That is going on in my area in the USA. Demand for houses far exceeds the supply, so people will waive inspection  in order to make an appealing bid to the seller.", "Uh, not in the last couple of years. I've been actively looking for a house (2nd, current rental & future retirement home) for years now, and lately a lot of the sales have gone to offers that are over asking with no contingencies, i.e. no-inspection, no-financing (cash). Our RE agent has told us that home inspectors went from being so busy as to be impossible to schedule in early-C days, to calling her begging for work bc so many offers were going through w/o inspection. There are signs that the market may be returning to some semblance of normality, slowly, but still... Methinks parents are hoping for a quick sale to a corporate or absentee buyer.", "It's a huge problem. People set up camp in the woods and then the cops come and clear them out and then they set up camp somewhere else.", "Exactly this. Hell, depending on severity and the company they work for, this could get them fired.\n\nYou're looking out for the realtor, potential buyers, and the public in general. Your mom and Rick are massive AHs for trying to run a scam and move to islands where the natives are struggling to survive because of gentrification.\n\nNTA OP, let them suffer with their decisions to let the house get to this state."]}
