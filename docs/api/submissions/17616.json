If anything he needs to stop acting so childish but then again he's a child so that might not happen.\n\nMaybe try asking him why he doesn't want to talk to you anymore? See if there's a deeper reasoning behind it, Like is he scared it might harm you or something.", "NTA you're a adult and you not addicted to it ...", "NTA. The child is being an idiot child. Your mom is being an asshole.", "NAH \u2014 you do get why he\u2019s upset, but you aren\u2019t abusing the stuff yourself; you are also a grown adult. Do you smoke it around him? If so, just avoid doing that.", "In my opinion you are in the right", "I think you're NTA regardless, but do you live in a place where weed is legal? That might have some impact.", "So\u2026 you should have been a bit more discreet. If it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business, then you shouldn\u2019t share it with an 11 year old. Especially if it\u2019s not legal in your jurisdiction\u2014that\u2019s a complicated bundle for a kid to deal with.\n\nI think you ought to apologize to him for making him deal with grownup stuff, and plainly say that it\u2019s none of his business if you use when he\u2019s not around and that it\u2019s not up for discussion.\n\nMild ESH all around for the adults, because you could have dealt with it better but your parents are unreasonably expecting to control your behavior. (Or expecting you to lie to him which isn\u2019t a solution either.)", "Soft YTA. I mean, I understand where you are coming from, but they are his parents and ultimately responsible for his upbringing, and if to them marijuana is unacceptable, then it is unacceptable. Also, you are upset that your brother isn't talking to you, so in turn you decided not to talk to your mother, instead of sitting down and discussing calmly what would be acceptable topics and opinions, and what wouldn't?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Society doing it openly as well as the people around us can be considered indirect pier pressure and influence.\n\nThat being said, it's hard for a youngin to grasp these things or to truly know what you yourself have gone through. I stopped the lettuce when I got into my mid 20's because even with working out, it wasn't healthy and was affecting my singing.\n\nI would be the bigger person and apologize but I'm the oldest (male) of 4 sisters and since my first sister came around I was charged with protecting her and being a good example. I will happily do that till the day I die and I love them very much, and have only really been mad at one once (and it was my fault).\n\nDon't take it too hard, it's a big age gap.  Also is it worth losing that respect for not apologizing? Who's gonna know?  \"Anger is temporary, family is forever\" -vin diesel probably.", "Thank you. I'll try talking to him tomorrow morning.", "No. I've never smoked around him. I've been smoking on and off since 2020 and he never knew anything until today. I feel using THC is no one's business.", "You're right. I'll make things right tomorrow. Thank you for your honesty.", "So if the parents want her to never drink, she should do that too?", "Thank you for your honesty. I really needed it.", "NTA you're not doing it round him and not letting it stop you doing things you should be doing it's not really his business and if she cares she can look after her own kid or pay for a babysitter", "She can do whatever she wants, she is an adult and carries full responsibility for her decision. But her parents can ask her not to discuss this matter with her brother.", "I mean personally I don\u2019t think the question is whether you\u2019re the asshole (which I think you\u2019re not, or at least \u201casshole\u201d isn\u2019t the right word). It\u2019s more about the fact that you\u2019re dealing with an 11 year old child. He doesn\u2019t understand things and his only experience with marijuana is a negative one. There are many ways to handle this; you\u2019re 30, he\u2019s 11. You need to act mature, not him. And I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not acting maturely, because you are\u2014I\u2019m just saying that you shouldn\u2019t expect him to act maturely.\n\nIn other words, maybe you just haven\u2019t had the experience needed to effectively deal with kids. It\u2019s not a moral issue, just something about adulting that\u2019s learned eventually.", "You\u2019d have a better point if OP wasn\u2019t helping raise this kid. If she said \u201cbabysitting,\u201d I\u2019d see your point, but it seems like she\u2019s standing in a as a parental figure and doing much more than a sister or nanny/babysitter. \n\nIf her parents want absolute power over all parenting decisions, then they need to do ALL the parenting. They want to have their cake and eat it too.", "That\u2019s not what the parents asked. The parents demanded she never partakes again.\n\nSo, back to the original query, if this was alcohol, is it acceptable for the parents to demand she never drink again because a child says so?", "Thank you. I needed that insight. I'll try to patch things up tomorrow morning.", "Children are often black and white. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s developmentally appropriate. Talk to him. He\u2019s probably heard the war on drugs stuff and is afraid. He\u2019s a child. Talk to him.", "NTA. Your choices as an adult are yours and kids have no place making them for you. People apologize when they've done something wrong. You haven't.\n\nWhen and if he calms down enough to have a talk then do that. Talk about his feelings and worries and maybe go through some information together about drugs and addiction. Make sure you very clearly tell him that your use of  weed is not something he has a say in and that you will not apologize because you haven't done anything wrong or shameful. \n\nIf you feel comfortable with it you could promise not to smoke when you are babysitting him. (From what you've said you already don't do this, but promising might help him feel like he has an out. He's made a scandal, there was some negotiation and now there's an agreed upon middle ground)", "NTA. I understand he\u2019s still young but weed is legal in A LOT of places. If he can understand people drinking the occasional beer and wine then he can understand this.", "This is silly you\u2019re the adult and he is a child send him back home to the parents then he won\u2019t have to deal with your \u201cdrug issue\u201d.. this story made me chuckle a-little but it\u2019s so silly you are a 30 year old woman act like an adult and stop trying to appease a kid that still has bre*st milk on his breath...", "NTA\n\nYou are a grown adult allowed to make your own decisions. Your mistake was letting your brother hear the conversation you had with your doctor but what's done is done.\n\nYour best bet is to sit down with him and get to the bottom of his reaction.  It could be something he's learnt in school and he's worried you will hurt yourself or go to jail.\n\nIs marijuana legal in your state?\n\nBut if this is coming from your mom, you have bigger issues.  It sounds like you do a lot for your mother in helping with the 11 year old.  Maybe in you will need to cut back a little.\n\nAlso there are drugs and there are drugs.  Medical cannabis is different to cocaine.\n\nWhat's his thoughts on tobacco and alcohol. Both can do you harm... but both are legal.", "NTA and i think you need to get him a book about all the good things marijuana does and how it can be used for medicine .", "NTA. It seems he's already been brainwashed to shout the stuff he did.", "NTA. I\u2019ve definitely seen kids go through that phase where they\u2019re super self-righteous about drugs and alcohol, I think because we get so many messages that Drugs Are Bad and Evil without much explanation of the nuances. Just wait until he\u2019s older and either tries this stuff himself, or has good friends who do. This silent treatment will pass.", "I remember in elementary school they had just started the \u201cjust say no!\u201d campaign and 8 year old me  went home crying because I thought we had to call the police and report my uncle for smoking weed.", "He was at a freaking doctors appointment. The little brother shouldn\u2019t have been asking questions anyways.", "100% it's a fear response. he's 11, you're his sister, you take care of him. he's scared. he might not even realise that he's scared. emotional maturity being under development still. \n\naaaaand we love to scare kids about drugs. school, parents, etc. it's just bad all around. \n\ngood luck i hope you can have a good talk and everyone feels better", "Alcohol is a drug, caffeine is a drug. It\u2019s really not a serious as he\u2019s imagining and definitely a fear situation. I hope it goes well"]}
