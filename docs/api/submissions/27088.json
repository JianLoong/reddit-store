I always preferred short haircut on guys, and I don\u2019t like long hair on guys because it just seems messy to me. My bf has known this since the beginning we\u2019ve been together. Last year I  wanted to dye my hair red, but my bf hates the color red and was urging me not to. Basically saying he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to me if I dyed my hair red. I was disappointed, but he kept his hair short since that was my preference, so why wouldn\u2019t I do the same for him. Well recently this year he\u2019s been growing out his hair. I asked him when he was going to get a haircut, and he said he\u2019s trying to grow out his hair a bit. I responded back \u201cwell don\u2019t grow it out too long because you know how I feel about long hair on guys\u201d. Months passed and his hair is way past his shoulders now. I personally think his hair is covering his handsome face, and it makes him look messy and not put together. I voiced to him again that I really preferred if he gets a haircut. He snapped at me saying it\u2019s his hair, and he can do what he want which I responded back well I guess I\u2019ll dye my hair red then. I only said that because I was upset with this double standard. He can whatever he wants to his hair, but I can\u2019t?? Anyways that made him even more mad claiming it\u2019s different.
