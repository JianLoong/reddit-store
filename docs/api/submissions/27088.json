I always preferred short haircut on guys, and I don\u2019t like long hair on guys because it just seems messy to me. My bf has known this since the beginning we\u2019ve been together. Last year I  wanted to dye my hair red, but my bf hates the color red and was urging me not to. Basically saying he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to me if I dyed my hair red. I was disappointed, but he kept his hair short since that was my preference, so why wouldn\u2019t I do the same for him. Well recently this year he\u2019s been growing out his hair. I asked him when he was going to get a haircut, and he said he\u2019s trying to grow out his hair a bit. I responded back \u201cwell don\u2019t grow it out too long because you know how I feel about long hair on guys\u201d. Months passed and his hair is way past his shoulders now. I personally think his hair is covering his handsome face, and it makes him look messy and not put together. I voiced to him again that I really preferred if he gets a haircut. He snapped at me saying it\u2019s his hair, and he can do what he want which I responded back well I guess I\u2019ll dye my hair red then. I only said that because I was upset with this double standard. He can whatever he wants to his hair, but I can\u2019t?? Anyways that made him even more mad claiming it\u2019s different.

I have zero understanding why anyone stays with people that are manipulative.  If I were you, I would die my hair red, pack my bags and go experience life and other men.

It's fine either way.", "NTA\n\nHis double standard is laughable", "I'm going to say NAH, but I feel your relationship is in a very rocky situation.

I had just started cosmetology school and was very excited to use work with professional color.  I told my boyfriend there was a red color that I loved and was going to try.  He hated red hair and said if I did it, he was going to shave his goatee off because he knew i loved it (it was the 90s).  I wasn't going to let him dictate what I did with my hair, so I colored it the color I wanted.  When he saw it, he went straight to the bathroom and shaved off his goatee.  He regretted it right away.  He learned he had no say in what I did with my hair.  Since then, my hair has been every color under the sun.  \n\nThe point is ESH for trying to dictate how the other person should look.  If you love your partner, you love them for them.  If you can't handle how your partner temporarily looks, because it is temporary, then you shouldn't be with them.
