Multiple comments raised the possibility, so I'm not going to answer them individually. Ryan was a planned pregnancy.

It sounds like he can use some family that give a crap.", "I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s an ah here but life is seldom simple and I doubt your parents had a whole child as some sort of replacement. This is simplistic and awful thinking. Telling it to a child wasn\u2019t a good idea. How did you think it would make things better? It sounds like the entire family needs therapy from dealing with a very sick child but short of that you maybe need to consider that you don\u2019t have all the answers and what you did was hurtful not just to your little brother but your parents who\u2019ve been thru a lot almost losing a child.", "ESH\n\n\nSo another possibility may be that he wasn\u2019t a replacement but an oops baby. They do happen. We had an adult math teacher who taught his brother. The teacher was probably about 30 (he had taught my sisters so probably out of school for a chunk of time) and his brother was 14. I think Sarah Palin also had an oops baby (her youngest is 14 and oldest 33). \n\n\nSometimes kids who are sick with say cancer or sick in general are babied more. Read about the crazy AITA where the sister has a younger sister who basically had her whole life revolving around her because she had cancer as a kid. In that post the parents even interrupted their aunt\u2019s wedding to say that the sister was okay after she vomited earlier in the day. Kinda sounds similar with how they focus on the kid who formerly had cancer even after they are healthy.\n\n\nHowever, Jake may have viewed the kid as his replacement and that has lead to resentment. \n\n\nThe parents probably have some guilt and fear associated with Jake being sick so they try to avoid upsetting him. After all, who wants a kid that lived through cancer to get upset? Ryan has his health at least. It\u2019s not right but further fuels the fire. \n\n\nI think the boys and the parents need therapy to be honest to process their emotions and feelings about the situations including having a sick kid.", "NTA: Your parents were just fine with making Ryan feel that way, but no one was supposed to actually tell him why?", "NTA. Your parents are awful. Both Ryan and Jake need therapy desperately. They were put in such an awful position by your parents.", "Why does Jake hate Ryan? If the OP is right regarding why the parents had Ryan, I can't imagine they would have told Jake.", ">Your brother deserves to know what happened in the family before he was born.\n\nEspecially as it's still influencing everyone's behaviour and how they are treating him. He was absolutely *entitled* to that info", ">They said I had no right to tell anyone their business or make up horrible conclusions. \n\nYeah, they'd much rather Ryan wallow in self-hatred than aim it at them. NTA OP. Maybe you or your sister can or are willing to help Ryan yeet himself out of that swamp before he's 18.", "The only thing I'm curious about is whether OP is actually right about Ryan being \"the replacement.\" I can certainly see why Jake possibly saw it that way, but it doesn't make it true, either. After all, there's no way the parents could know they would have another boy. What if they'd had a girl?\n\nThere's still clearly an issue regarding the way Ryan is being treated by both Jake and his parents. But the OP mentions their parents are ok with Ryan when Jake is not around. That could imply the whole issue is the typical \"we never do anything to upset the miracle child.\" They bend over backwards for Jake because he was always the favourite AND because he nearly died. Ryan could well have been an accidental pregnancy.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the parents are still the AHs to their youngest by playing favourites. Jake is also being an AH for taking it out on his innocent brother. Even if OPs claim is true, its not Ryan's fault. Its his parents he should be mad at.\n\nBut its also possible that Jake and OP have simply assumed Ryan was a replacement baby because it seems that way to them. But the detail about not being able to choose your baby's gender does make it seem less likely, along with him happening to be born when Ryan was at his sickest. Its not like you can plan ahead and know that you will get pregnant and have a baby be born in time with another child's sickness. Its not impossible, but you'd manage it more on luck than planning. \n\nI'm just thinking that these sort of details are the kind of thing a child would not consider when forming an opinion on a situation. By the time they were adults, the idea was so ingrained that they'd never thought back over the possibilities. Its clear that this notion has never been discussed between the parents and children before.\n\nSo if it isn't true and is just a product of assumption, then OP is a bit of an AH too, because she just stirred the pot and possibly made everything worse. ITs this final part that got to me;\n\n> They said I had no right to tell anyone their business or make up horrible conclusions. I didn't make it up. I know the truth.\n\nThe parents are obviously denying this. OP says they know the truth. But do they, or is it just an assumption? It may be or it may not. We certainly don't know for sure, but it also sounds like OP and Jake don't really know for sure, either. They just come to that conclusion because it seems to fit. But its still just an assumption and assumption is the mother of all fuckups.\n\nI don't think I could call judgement on this one because there's no way to be sure of what is accurate. I do think the parents and Jake need to sort their shit out, though. Whatever the reasons, they're hurting Ryan for something that is not his fault.", "Parents can forget that children as siblings are their own organism - not just extensions of those parents.

I wonder how Jake felt that he would be replaced by another once he passes. And poor Ryan for being treated like the spare. What terrible terrible parents. Any parent that wants a child of a certain gender should never be allowed to have children. Assholes!", "It affects the whole family dynamic so it's definitely not just their business.

I wonder if it's one of those times when a kid is very sick and the parents quickly made another one for \"compatible spare parts\". It's the best for bone marrow transplant. In that case, it doesn't matter the gender of the last kid. He's just here the save the older one.", "Yeah, I think that the replacement part absolutely could be Jake's assumption, and incorrect. It's just as likely the parents fell into a pattern of bending themselves around Jake because he was going to die, not reprimanding him or in any way pushing back his assumptions, and instead treating Ryan like shit to keep Jake happy. Still asshole behavior, still requiring therapy all around, but none of it requires the replacement hypothesis to be truth. So if OP related this to Ryan as truth, that his parents don't really care about him because Jake didn't need replacing, then OP gets into AH territory too. Also, therapy territory, I suspect, since this must have been so hard on the sisters too", "I agree.

The kid isn't stupid, he understands what's going on around him...  He was probably already putting the pieces together..  All his parents are doing if causing problem for the future.\n\nI also expect, that ppl don't drop a bomb on a child to let him cope with what they just learned.  Imagine being that child and learning what he did, then just leaving him there to deal with it all.. \n\nSo now he knows the truth, what now?

Imagine their chosen one heir turned out to be uninterested in having children of their own, was a trans woman, infertile, or just plain fucked right out of their lives because of this crap.

Your parents and Jake (to a lesser extent) are the AHs.", "NTA how sad", "NTA. Your brother needs context to the neglect and abuse he\u2019s suffered.  If he knows the problem is his parents then he knows it\u2019s not him. I think your parents and brother would prefer he did though. And their reaction is either evidence of that or surprise that  was your conclusion. Either way it wasn\u2019t a denial. Furthermore, how is it NOT his business?! He\u2019s entitled to know why he is being treated the way he is. \nYour parents and Jake need a good swift kick to the rear. And possibly more.", "NTA\nGlad to hear your brother has been in remission! But what a lousy situation that really didn\u2019t need to be this way. I think telling Ryan the real reason- upsetting as it is- is better than letting him fill in the blanks to understand why his brother hates him. Feeling unwanted or unloved by parents and older siblings is profoundly damaging to a child and those impacts last a lifetime if not dealt with. \nThe comment Jake made about being thankful for parents and sisters - intentionally excluding his younger brother- was immature and petty. Your parents punishing Ryan for his reaction and ignoring him when Jake is around is also petty, immature and cruel.\nYou did the right thing here and Ryan will remember that. He\u2019ll remember that you risked everyone being upset at you for standing up for him. It\u2019s easy to think that the difference of one person being on your side is minimal, and that might be true when it is the difference between 4 and 5 people for instance, but if it is the difference between 0 and 1 that is massive and can literally make all the difference.\nI\u2019ve had some serious health issues myself and fortunately am clear of them now, but I do get that it can be very emotional and confusing even as an adult, so if he was at his sickest when he was young that had to be extra rough, so I can have some empathy for Jake here to a point but after a decade certainly a person needs to be doing some work on himself to stop carrying that emotion and taking it out on people around him.", "NTA. Can you imagine how much of your brother's life up to now has been spent trying to figure out what he did wrong to make his parents aloof and his brother despise him? You did him a huge favor. He doesn't have to work that shift anymore. He knows it isn't anything he did or anything he can fix. He can put the energy he used trying to gain acceptance to find others who like him for who he is.", "This family dynamic sounds toxic as hell; the least anyone could do is tell the kid who's too young to extricate himself from it the truth about *why* it's like that. NTA.", "NTA. And tell your parents they are the one who fucked up and were horrible parents.\nIt might be a hard duty, but hopefully you and your older sister can give Ryan the love he deserves", "NTA, Ryan deserves to know the truth so that he can at the very least internalize that this dynamic isn't his fault and that there's nothing inherently wrong with him. \n\nJake, my heart goes out to him and I cannot imagine how much it must have hurt to be at your sickest when a newborn is brought into the house. Jake deserved so much better. You deserved so much better. But Jake continuing to direct this energy towards Ryan present day is wrong and cruel, no matter how valid and painful Jake's feelings here are. Ryan doesn't deserve to be punished, hurt, or excluded for circumstances around his existence that are entirely out of his control. I'm not saying Jake should drop all of his own feelings and pretend to be a doting brother to Ryan, but he also shouldn't be making such an effort to make it clear to Ryan how much negativity he garners towards him. \n\nJake is an adult man, he is the same age as I am right now. I'm no stranger to severe illness and sickness and how it impacts a family's overall health and well-being. Jake is an adult man here, and Ryan is a child. It is no longer appropriate for Jake to direct so much blame and hostility towards Ryan over circumstances that were entirely out of Ryan's control. Especially when your parents already make a point of de-prioritizing Ryan in order to cater to Jake here. How aware is Jake of this dynamic? Does he understand how his parents are treating Ryan to cater to him? Has he ever once acknowledged that it's not Ryan's fault for being brought into existence? That he didn't ask to be born and that he didn't will himself into existence to spite Jake? \n\nI'm less concerned about the parents, despite them being the ringleaders of all of this dysfunction and toxicity, than I am about Jake. Because if Ryan can see that his older siblings reject his parents' mentalities and reasoning to their abusive treatment, then he can learn from that and understand that there is a better and healthier world waiting for him when he's older. The biggest source of negative impact here would be a sibling that supports this disparate treatment and reinforces notions like him being a justifiable target for blame and malice. This can create a lot of cascading mental and even physical health issues down the road. I would ask Jake if that's what he wants? Does he want Ryan growing up sad, confused, feeling excluded from his own family - over circumstances entirely out of control? Does he want Ryan to have self-esteem issues? Does he want Ryan to develop anxiety and depression? Does he want Ryan to believe that he is unwanted, or a burden, or a mistake? Why does he want Ryan to believe this? \n\nThese are big and powerful questions that I assume even you don't have the answer to. And he most likely won't answer those questions honestly outside of a confidential setting. He needs to confront his own desire to see a child hurting, especially now that he's an adult. He owes it to himself and the relatives he actually wants in his life to put in the work to unlearn this misdirected blame and malice. Otherwise, Ryan will continue to suffer and Jake will never see a true way forwards from all of the pain he's experienced growing up. If Ryan can see that his siblings denounce this treatment, and affirm to him that he deserves better, that alone can be enough to mitigate a humongous portion of this damage and hurt. But if Ryan sees Jake insist on the current dysfunctional dynamic as well-deserved, that causes the greatest potential for lasting mental health issues for Ryan.", "NTA but your parents and Jake absolutely are.", "YTA and I may be in the minority, but he\u2019s 12!

He deserves to know the truth, rather than sitting there wondering why he is on the outside of the family, looking in. \n\nNow your parents and Jake have to face the consequences of their actions. That's what their mad about. Because Ryan knowing the truth means they have to face the consequences of their actions and address the situation thats been the elephant in the room for 12 years. They're mad that the situation THEY CHOSE TO CREATE is not a situation they actually have to deal with and address like freaking adults. I would tell your parents \"You lied to him for his entire life to make yourselves feel better without a single thought to how it would effect Ryan. I actually do love my brother and since this isn't about me or your feelings, but about his, I told him. Something you should have done.

They're ruining Ryan's life and it could cause him serious mental health issues (like it's already doing).", "NTA. Your parents had Ryan as a backup plan in the event of Jake\u2019s death.

You guys sound like you need family (and maybe individual) therapy, or at least an open and honest discussion between your parents, ryan, and jake.

You sound like a shit disturber. Unless your parents have explicitly said they had Ryan as a replacement, you are speculating.", ">They demanded that I call Ryan and tell him what I said was a mean prank. They said I had no right to tell anyone their business or make up horrible conclusions. I didn't make it up. I know the truth.\n\nNTA. Good for you!\n\nFamilies who keep massive secrets are horribly toxic. You showed Ryan that you prioritized him over the parents demand for secrecy. That's amazing for your 12yo brother.\n\nAs much as learning the truth must suck for him, the fact you were brave enough to be honest is huge. Huge for you. Huge for Ryan. And huge for the normal sibling relationship the two of you can have going forward. You're his damn hero right now. The only one in the whole family who sees him and understands him.\n\nWhat the hell is with \"tell him it's a prank\". Holy shit. Ryan isn't stupid.

There's no actionable abuse going on for them to intervene.", "I'd say op is right if only because the parents were very vocal about not wanting another child until their prized son was about to die.", "The four kids.

I didnt want a second child and had a surprise pregnancy. I was 20 weeks before we told my family or my 5 year old. I spent my entire pregnancy miserable because pregnancy sucks for me (trauma response and physically), coming to grips with being pregnant but also loving this new little life that was forming, and terrified my 5 year old would feel neglected or replaced. \n\nAll of my fears were unfounded. Watching my husband and daughter both experience pregnancy for the first time made some of the worst days for me mentally and physically, more bearable.. I agonize over my word choices with my 5 year old so I'm not 'blaming the baby' so to speak, when my daughter asks me to do something and my hands are full. Shes the best big sister and has always been so excited for a sibling. If she hadn't been we would have made sure to address it in therapy.", "I was actually expecting Ryan to have been born to be an organ donor for Jake, but I'm super jaded like that.", "There's still clearly an issue regarding the way Ryan is being treated by both Jake and his parents.", "\"My Brother's Keeper\"", "There's a big difference between not wanting a fourth child and terminating an unexpected pregnancy, though. Even people who swear they don't want any children often change their minds when they get unexpectedly pregnant.\n\nThat's the thing - its easy to read into it what you already feel. They said they didn't want another kid and now they're having one. I feel like I'm being replaced. Kids often have main character syndrome and assume everything is about them, when it often isn't.\n\nAnother thing that makes me doubt it is why have the \"replacement baby,\" before Jake died? OP assumes they were replacing Jake because the baby was born when Jake was at his worst. But that would just make the parents' lives hell. A new baby and a very sick child isn't a good combination. If they were really as heartless as this notion suggests, you'd \"replace,\" the child after they've gone, when its easier to cope. That and the whole \"impossible to predict the sex,\" really make it seem not as obvious as OP suggests.\n\nAgain, not to say I think its definitely not true, but only that there's enough details that make it not entirely make sense.\n\nThe biggest problem with this family seems to be that everyone has kept their thoughts and feelings to themselves. Nothing has ever been discussed. They've all got these pent-up feelings of anger and resentment, thoughts and beliefs that have never been expressed and its all built up to boiling point and caused all this. The whole lot of them need to get into therapy and get some professional help where they can actually talk this out and express their feelings in a controlled environment.

I would've", ">Actually, it could still be that Ryan was a donor baby. It could have been placental blood/cells or umbilical cord.  \n>  \n>It would even make sense with the timeline, They had the baby just in time because Jake was at his sickest, so it's presumed he got better after Ryan's birth.  \n>  \n>There's often a lot of secrecy about doing this because people tend to frown on parents breeding children for spare parts.  So it is more than possible that OP was never told this part.  \n>  \n><<*Umbilical cord blood has an important and growing role in the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma, sickle cell anemia and other life-threatening diseases*\\>><<*Just like the cells found in cord blood, the placenta stem cells can be used for life-saving transplants to treat diseases including leukemia, certain metabolic abnormalities, and inherited diseases of the immune system or red blood cells*\\>>  \n>  \n>There was the one Medical show episode where the kid was literally bred to be the spare parts for sibling(blood, organs, etc).

Basically my sisters keeper but with brothers instead.", "I was thinking that they did it for the cord blood or bone marrow.  If that was the case, then Ryan would have been born to try and save Jake's life, not to replace him.  I know someone who was conceived just to try to save her older sister, who was dying of leukemia.  She wasn't a match and her sister died.  It screws with her brain and self-esteem to this day.  She constantly feels like a failure.  Her parents never got over the loss of her older sister.  I don't think that they blamed her, but it doesn't stop her from blaming herself.  Why do people do this and not think of the impact on the child?", "Me too.

You need to help him.", "ESH OP, I had cancer as a teen and my parents did really erratic things during that time. My siblings and I were all victims of some of those things and caused a lot of emotional damage. My parents also refused outside help like therapy because I think they suspected it might make those erratic things known. There were points where they admitted they were making bad decisions that would cause damage and then pretend like they didn\u2019t the next. I lost one of my parents only a few years after that, but the other one and I had to have a series of heart to hearts about how they made really poor decisions at the time.\n\nHaving said that, you should have confronted your parents and Jake about this before your youngest brother. They are the ones that caused this situation and they could change it. And this might be too big of a burden for Ryan right now. He\u2019s only 12 and he still has to live in the house with them. I know he senses a problem, and I\u2019m not totally against telling him at all, but he doesn\u2019t have the power or the tools to deal with that big of a problem and it sounds like you don\u2019t live there anymore, so you can\u2019t mediate.

Ryan is just a kid and he is not guilty for any of this. But what you said to him, no matter how good your intention was, is going to be a big trauma for him. His young brain is too naive and unaware of the world and there is no chance that he will understand this as a mature person. He will for sure feel extremenly unloved and worthless for a veeery long time or maybe his whole life and not just in your family but also in general in life - in school, with girls, with friends ...I cant  know exactly how this will manifest, but this wont manifest good for him, be sure of that.x\nI know this because I had a similar situation in life. When I was 13 my grandma revealed to me  the truth about my father. He was cheating on my mom a lot and had other girlfriend that was kinda living with.( he was often absent from home, but my oarents always said it was for work) This totally broke me. I felt like my father had betrayed me and our family and that we were worthless to him. I started distancing from him and he noticed this so he also started distancing from me.It wasnt the problem only that my father was cheating, but it was that i was living in this toxic dynamic for the next years. My mom decided not to divorce him and continue to live like this because in that time in eastern europe divorce was very frowned upon.\n Also my granda made me swear to never reveal to my parents that i know this which made my life even harder. I was going through a lot of heavy emotions but had no one to talk to about this. Fyi i have been dealing with depresion and anxiety ever since i was 14. I needed 7 years of intense therapy to overcome some of this trauma. And im quite sure ill never completely overcome it. My point is - i know my grandma had good intentions when she told me this, but it totally ruined my childhood. I was living a happy life when i didnt know my fathers betrayal. I am  now, at 28, much more capable to understand the situation and see through all the angles and understand that it wasnt my fault and that he was still a good father even though he was not a good husband (they are different points,and not correlated). I spent 12 years of my life loathing a father who was actally good in many ways, i was just too young to understand the complexity of the situations. and probably it will be the same for your brother. My point is, your intention was good, but it doesnt make the situation right. Also your brother will need therapy asap (he probably  needed therapy even before you told him your view).The sooner he starts, the better.\n\nAnyways back to your story., in this situation i blame mostly your parents and your brother jake. You should have talked with them and make them treat your brother better or go to therapy. Also whats with your parents and loving their son? Is it a heir thing or sth? Anyways this is mostly their fault. First REPLACING their son while he is STILL ALIVE. Thats where your brother Jake's frustration comes from. Then regretting their second son. Thats where Ryan's frustration comes from, and what made Jake direct his fristration towards Ryan. I think Jake is actually frustrated with your parents but it is easier to avert his anger towards someone smaller who cant defend himself, then towards his parents who were supposed to be his caregivers, but they actually betrayed him when he was sick. They were more concerned about having a son(the concept) then having the person(Jake). They also ALLOWED and supported Jakes bad behaveur towards Ryan by ignoring him when Jake is around. At the end they guilt tripped you about this and try to make you lie to your little brother.\n\nWhat you should do now is make Ryan go to therapy, he'll need a shit ton of it. And also,as his sibling, try to be there for him as much as you can. I think also Jake might need some therapy and you should suggest it.  Also try to talk a lot with him about your parents behavior and how they betrayed him, about his anger and how Ryan is not responsible for it. If he is not open for this talk, then thats his decision. Then just tey to make him be less rude towards Ryan and try to protect Ryan from him.\n And about your parents... I have no words. I dont think they would ever be able to understand their mistakes so confronting them will probably be pointless. Just try to make everything to protect ryan from their toxic behavior.\nWhats happeing to Ryan right now is very traumatic, but it can be reversed or at least easied if there is someone else close by who will provide him with a lot of love and care.", "What is up with how many people \"hate\" innocent children???

Like I heard that sometimes parents have a baby for cord blood, stem cells, or bone marrow match to help save a sick child. Is that something that happened with Jake and Ryan?\n\nI'd also talk to Jake about it, honestly.

You can bring up the possibility Ryan was born to help save Jake and he owes him his life. You can also say it's possible that it was a coincidence, which it is. Maybe your parents had an accident when Jake was sick, and couldn't bear to have an abortion. Maybe losing a child already an abortion would be too hard on them or something, we don't know.\n\nAlso, tell Jake he needs to start treating Ryan better.

Even though you and Jake believe that\u2019s the truth, it\u2019s cruel to say that to a kid who\u2019s already facing the awkwardness of that age and the hormones of puberty starting to cause their own brand of misery. I saw your edit that the pregnancy was quite intentional, but that doesn\u2019t immediately mean he was meant as a replacement for Jake, and it doesn\u2019t sound like your parents have ever said anything like that. Whether the decision came about t increase the chances of a genetic match or because Jake\u2019s illness made them realize that they did want another child, or some other reason, sharing your guess about their reasons is extremely cruel and hurtful to your baby brother. The timing was likely because of mom\u2019s age too because it\u2019s harder and harder to get pregnant and to carry to term at almost 40. You owe Ryan and your parents some huge apologies for creating this very painful situation. \nYour parents are acting terribly in ignoring Jake\u2019s awful treatment of Ryan and they need to openly discuss their reasons for adding another child now, painful or not. I\u2019m guessing that Jake gets away with murder because they came so close to losing him, but they need to stop because it\u2019s turned him into an entitled jerk now. Your parents sound like they love all of you, but are basically still spoiling Jake in their gratitude over his survival and that is contributing to everyone seeing Ryan as the unnecessary replacement still. Your parents saying they were glad Jake was a boy because they wanted to be done probably added to the impression that they only wanted a replacement son, but for some reason their decision changed 10 years later. They made an unfunny joke that stuck with their kids for decades and now it\u2019s hurting Ryan because of his older siblings embracing that joke as the gospel truth. \nI\u2019ve seen an in law be hurt by her mother saying that she hadn\u2019t wanted another baby, right in front of the youngest and acting like everyone should just laugh. I saw the same thing happen to my aunt and uncle who were regularly forced to hear how they had not been wanted and that only the oldest three children were even supposed to have been born at all. My aunt and uncle both took years to find their footing in life and it seems directly related to spending their entire lives hearing that they were mistakes who had been completely unwanted. That\u2019s what you just did to Ryan you told him that he\u2019s a mistake who isn\u2019t wanted and never was wanted. YOU NEED TO IMMEDIATELY WORK ON FIXING THE DAMAGE THAT YOU CAUSED TO HIM!!!", "NTA. Ryan is being treated abusively by your brother and he's just a kid who doesn't understand why his big brother doesn't love him. Really wondering if he's being treated abusively by your parents too, since they seem to let Jake hurt him purposefully without saying anything and punishing him when he gets upset about it. I don't suppose Ryan could come live with you?

How many stories are there of women asking for sterility procedures, after kids, who were asked \"but what if they *die*\", the implication clearly being *but how will you replace them*. By actual fucking doctors.", "You\u2019re still assuming that facing mortality through their child have a life-threatening illness didn\u2019t change their minds though. Your edit says that your parents absolutely denied that Ryan was born to replace Jake if he died. Maybe a baby represented joy to them in an impossibly horrible time in their lives. Your brother was extremely ill and being treated with chemicals that mess with your brain function too and you have embraced the interpretation that he had at the time. Make this right because all you really did was cause incredible hurt to a kid based on nothing but speculation.", "Yep, total speculation. You're quite right.", "Something similar also happened in a tv show (called 9-1-1) one of the main characters was neglected by his parents and finally was told (later as an adult) that he was born as a donor baby and when his brother passed away his parents sort of blamed him in a way and neglected him while also never telling him the truth so he just thought they hated him for no reason.", "This is the only reasonable response", "Info : Has Jake mis-read the situation: Ryan was conceived to help treat Jake's illness, not replace Jake? \nI am thinking stem cell or bone marrow transplant style treatment?\n\nEither way, poor Ryan for coping a shitty brother.", "NTA.\n\nLike the comment above said, given the timeline and rush for a pregnancy it might be that Ryan wasn't a replacement baby but a \"Savior Baby\" for Jake.

The reason for this conflict is because Jake and your parents ATA. \nAlso Jake's been in remission for what, nearly half of his life now? He's a fully grown man now and he blames a child for his parents actions? Wow. I'm sorry for what he's gone through and the rough hand he was dealt but your parents really let both of their sons down big time.", "A 23 year old shouldn't be bullying a 12 year old.\n\nWhy isn't he mad at your parents? The child that's half his age obviously isn't responsible for his own existence.", "So? Just because they want to have another kid it's a gigantic leap in logic that because their dying child miraculously recovered, they and the recovered child forever \"resent\" the youngest child that they were previously desperate for.  To assert that conclusion to an impressionable younger sibling, she needs more than armchair psychologist speculation.", "This.  At 23, Jake is well past the age of knowing any resentment & worse he feels for Ryan is not justified & is a result of his own issues with his parents actions & his standing with them.  He is old enough to BEHAVE kindly to Ryan even though he\u2019s not in an emotional place to FEEL kindly towards him yet.  Ryan is just as horrible as his parents at this point - but I guess he learned that his behavior is okay from the both of them.  How sad that he is using the life he has to be so cruel to an innocent child."]}
