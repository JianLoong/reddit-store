If my brother has sat me down and told me \u201cyou know you\u2019re like this bc you hit your head and our parents hate themselves for it so much they hate you\u201d I would be a lot more well adjusted. Not even a doctor could tell me that because my parents downplayed it so much I didn\u2019t even know I had actual damage to my brain until like two years ago- I\u2019m almost 40. This conversation led me to actually get my head checked after 30 years of not knowing how bad it was.\n\nAnyway, it would\u2019ve been nice to have a sibling acknowledge that my parents did actually hate me and that I wasn\u2019t \u201cbeing selfish and dramatic\u201d like they said I was. I probably would have addressed the brain injury years ago.\n\nSorry to dump this just really hit home for me. Your brother deserves better and I truly believe you did the right thing.", "NTA.

One day you\u2019ll have kids and realize all of the myriad complex emotions that go into loving your children. They can hardly be summed up with \u201cRyan was the replacement for Jake but Jake survived so Ryan isn\u2019t necessary anymore.\u201d Maybe listen to your parents when they tell you you jumped to a horrible conclusion.\n\nETA: you all (including parents) need therapy. You should stop playing therapist.", "ESH. Sorry but you don't \"know the truth\", there's a lot of assumptions on your side.

Just try to be there for him, with those kinda parents and big brother, he needs someone to have HIS back.", "NTA. What you said wasn't a mean prank, it was the truth. Sooner or later Ryan would have found out. I hope he can find the family who doesn't regret him like you. The fact that he wasn't counted as family was the first hint in him finding out.", "NTA\n\nYour brother deserves to know what happened in the family before he was born. You just behaved like a big sister. Besides, it's better that he knows it's not his fault or anything that he did, that can lead to a lot of unnecessary self-hatred that he absolutely doesn't deserve.\n\nAlso your parents could really use some therapy, they don't seem aware of what they're doing and how badly it can affect Ryan. Or they know, and they miserably dismiss it. Either way, not good.", "NTA.  Your parents, however, are assholes of a scale I can't even begin to imagine.  Treating their youngest as surplus to requirements because their first son ended up being okay is reprehensible.  Not to mention viewing him as a \u201creplacement\u201d were Jake not to survive, as if a child is some kind of commodity.\n\nRyan will grow to resent them and it would not be at all a surprise if, when he is an adult, he cuts contact with them entirely.  I'm sure that at that point your parents will do a *surprised Pikachu face* and find it mystifying that the son they neglected and emotionally abused wants nothing to do with them.", "As NTA as it gets but you should have a convo with Jake on what a poor human beeing blames his own blood for beeing born - just with a better choice of words. But not too nice. Im a year younger and sometimes we need to be broken a bit to accept our position was unjustified :) or screenshot this comment, if you did \u2026 JAKE or whstever your real name ist, whats wrong with you bro. Its a grim situation but I (onlychild) would kill for a brother that looks up to me, that i can habe a positive impact on. I dont wanna say it cause i hate that term and what it means but man the F up", "NTA He's noticed what's happening around him and deserves to be told the truth. If you hadn't told him, he would likely spend the rest of his life thinking he was naturally unlovable. Please don't tell him it was a prank, that would be an incredibly cruel thing to do.\r  \n\r  \nAs you have been the one to tell him, I do believe it's now your responsibility to check in on him to see how he is coping with this new information. Help him in anyway you can if he's having problems with it. That's some heavy information to lay on a kid, you have to make sure he's doing okay. Be aware that your parents will almost certainly use the prank line to cover up, if they haven't done so already.", "I agree with you. Because while OP may be right about Jake reasoning I think it's unfair for them to say the parents only see Ryan as the replacement.  It give me the same vibes as \"well you were an accident so they didn't really want you\". \n\nThe parents actions most likely them continuing to baby their child who they thought wouldn't be alive today.\n\nESH", "What? Do you think his parents are going to admit \"we hate the fact that we had Ryan as a replacement for Jake when it turns out we really didn't need to?\" They'd likely deny it because anyone with an ounce of commonsense or conscience knows that would be a horrible truth to admit out loud and they'd be socially ostracized for it when word got around.
