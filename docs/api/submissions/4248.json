I gave him an explanation he needed to hear, because otherwise he'd assume there was something wrong with him he could never fix. That's no way to force your child to live.\"", "NTA.  Jake needs to grow up. He's an adult. Ryan is just a child. What Jake did is awful. Ryan didn't choose to be born.", "NTA and what a terrible situation.  Both Jake and your parents are in the wrong - I feel for you for being caught in the middle and for poor Ryan for being born into a situation against his control.\n\nI feel like there is a desperate need for family counselling in this situation.  Good luck.", "I did this for my (half)brothers, too. I wasn't around them much but we had one summer together and I noticed a really bad dynamic between one of them and my dad. One late night, with Dad out of the house and us just \"chatting\" we casually drifted into conversation about my issues with my mom and that led to them both, but mostly one, talking about all their issues. \n\n\"How do you stay so calm and not get so mad at your mom?\" Bro asked. \"Oh, just like our Dad, I know she has mental health issues and that all this drama in her head is about her and not about me.\" Cue stares of \"wha????\" from the bros and it comes out that no one ever told them our dad had mental health issues to the point of being involuntarily (once) and voluntarily (twice) institutionalized.\n\nI then spent some time helping them (I hope) reframe the actions of the dad so that they could understand that it wasn't their fault or responsibility. It was affecting them and it wasn't good - saying \"he has health issues\" is not a \"so therefore it's all good and forgive him\" NOPE. It's \"he does this cuz he's ... and NOT because YOU are the problem\". It doesn't always help, but sometimes it does.\n\nNTA - you are helping Ryan. Your parents want you to lie because they don't like the mirror held up to them. So they tell themselves they aren't doing that. You know. Protect yourself and your little bro!", "Your family is a disaster and you're the only one who's trying to make it less of one. NTA, but holy shit.", "Considering that Ryan had a right to know such an ungentle thing - NTA. I'm so sorry the burden of his pains fell to you to explain. But, at least he heard it from someone who has proven she loves him through and through for himself and not as any substitute brother.\n\n NTA. Your parents and Jake on the other hand, really seem like a holes on this particular score?", "NTA\n\nJake and your parents are TAs, though. \nThey had a replacement baby, and are treating him like crap. He did nothing wrong. Jake still gets all the attention, and acts like a brat, so he has no reason to behave the way he does. \n\nSomeone needed to tell Ryan. He has a right to know why half of his family hate him.", "NTA. Poor Ryan.", "NTA\n\nTelling him the truth, while I am sure painful, is better than years of trying to get in Jake's good graces and not know why he not loved.", "NTA\n\nYou're parents whose decision to start baby-making while their child is dying of cancer certainly are.", "NTA. He's young, but which is worse, him being told his parents suck, or leaving him to think he is not worthy of love? I hope you can still support Ryan. It sounds like he can use some family that give a crap.", "I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s an ah here but life is seldom simple and I doubt your parents had a whole child as some sort of replacement. This is simplistic and awful thinking. Telling it to a child wasn\u2019t a good idea. How did you think it would make things better? It sounds like the entire family needs therapy from dealing with a very sick child but short of that you maybe need to consider that you don\u2019t have all the answers and what you did was hurtful not just to your little brother but your parents who\u2019ve been thru a lot almost losing a child.", "ESH\n\n\nSo another possibility may be that he wasn\u2019t a replacement but an oops baby. They do happen. We had an adult math teacher who taught his brother. The teacher was probably about 30 (he had taught my sisters so probably out of school for a chunk of time) and his brother was 14. I think Sarah Palin also had an oops baby (her youngest is 14 and oldest 33). \n\n\nSometimes kids who are sick with say cancer or sick in general are babied more. Read about the crazy AITA where the sister has a younger sister who basically had her whole life revolving around her because she had cancer as a kid. In that post the parents even interrupted their aunt\u2019s wedding to say that the sister was okay after she vomited earlier in the day. Kinda sounds similar with how they focus on the kid who formerly had cancer even after they are healthy.\n\n\nHowever, Jake may have viewed the kid as his replacement and that has lead to resentment. \n\n\nThe parents probably have some guilt and fear associated with Jake being sick so they try to avoid upsetting him. After all, who wants a kid that lived through cancer to get upset? Ryan has his health at least. It\u2019s not right but further fuels the fire. \n\n\nI think the boys and the parents need therapy to be honest to process their emotions and feelings about the situations including having a sick kid.", "NTA: Your parents were just fine with making Ryan feel that way, but no one was supposed to actually tell him why?", "NTA. Your parents are awful. Both Ryan and Jake need therapy desperately. They were put in such an awful position by your parents.", "Why does Jake hate Ryan? If the OP is right regarding why the parents had Ryan, I can't imagine they would have told Jake.", ">Your brother deserves to know what happened in the family before he was born.\n\nEspecially as it's still influencing everyone's behaviour and how they are treating him. He was absolutely *entitled* to that info", ">They said I had no right to tell anyone their business or make up horrible conclusions. \n\nYeah, they'd much rather Ryan wallow in self-hatred than aim it at them. NTA OP. Maybe you or your sister can or are willing to help Ryan yeet himself out of that swamp before he's 18.", "The only thing I'm curious about is whether OP is actually right about Ryan being \"the replacement.\" I can certainly see why Jake possibly saw it that way, but it doesn't make it true, either. After all, there's no way the parents could know they would have another boy. What if they'd had a girl?\n\nThere's still clearly an issue regarding the way Ryan is being treated by both Jake and his parents. But the OP mentions their parents are ok with Ryan when Jake is not around. That could imply the whole issue is the typical \"we never do anything to upset the miracle child.\" They bend over backwards for Jake because he was always the favourite AND because he nearly died. Ryan could well have been an accidental pregnancy.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the parents are still the AHs to their youngest by playing favourites. Jake is also being an AH for taking it out on his innocent brother. Even if OPs claim is true, its not Ryan's fault. Its his parents he should be mad at.\n\nBut its also possible that Jake and OP have simply assumed Ryan was a replacement baby because it seems that way to them. But the detail about not being able to choose your baby's gender does make it seem less likely, along with him happening to be born when Ryan was at his sickest. Its not like you can plan ahead and know that you will get pregnant and have a baby be born in time with another child's sickness. Its not impossible, but you'd manage it more on luck than planning. \n\nI'm just thinking that these sort of details are the kind of thing a child would not consider when forming an opinion on a situation. By the time they were adults, the idea was so ingrained that they'd never thought back over the possibilities. Its clear that this notion has never been discussed between the parents and children before.\n\nSo if it isn't true and is just a product of assumption, then OP is a bit of an AH too, because she just stirred the pot and possibly made everything worse. ITs this final part that got to me;\n\n> They said I had no right to tell anyone their business or make up horrible conclusions. I didn't make it up. I know the truth.\n\nThe parents are obviously denying this. OP says they know the truth. But do they, or is it just an assumption? It may be or it may not. We certainly don't know for sure, but it also sounds like OP and Jake don't really know for sure, either. They just come to that conclusion because it seems to fit. But its still just an assumption and assumption is the mother of all fuckups.\n\nI don't think I could call judgement on this one because there's no way to be sure of what is accurate. I do think the parents and Jake need to sort their shit out, though. Whatever the reasons, they're hurting Ryan for something that is not his fault.", "Parents can forget that children as siblings are their own organism - not just extensions of those parents. And so siblings reveal to each other and that's to be expected at times.", "Will they though? They sound like the biggest AHs in this story. Imagine having a baby just because you wanted a living one with a penis.", "The heir and the spare.", "Right. A 23 year old sits there and says he's grateful for his whole family except that one child, and the parents are like \"yeah, that's fine\"\n\nBut lil bro gets sent to his room for being upset. \n\nWhat on earth is going on at all these thanskgiving meals? The posts recently have been awful, and it's always the kids getting the short end of the stick", "> Jake needs to get over it,\n\neven if Jake can't \"get over it\", he can stop actively taking it out on Ryan. He doesn't have to suddenly become the best brother and friend ever, but he could stop going out of his way to be purposefully nasty to a child.", "This just because you were sick as a kid doesn\u2019t give you the right as a fucking 23 year old man to bully a 12 year old", "I had to read it again  Jake  need to man or go to therapy  something, taking his anger on a kid \nthat low and  he ta along with his parents  I hope there don't be pikachu surpise with Ryan  wont nothing to do with Jake  or his parents.

Not to mention a new born cries at late nights, parents were caring for Ryan when Jake was potentially dying.\n\nJake would see Ryan as replacement as a child. Probably he felt that when he dies, no one will even miss him as Ryan is here, yk.\n\nJake seriously needs Therapy, man. \n\nThe Parents don't deserve to have kids. I don't think after few Thanksgiving they're going to have dinner together, anymore.", "Not only because they wanted him as a replacement, but a replacement *boy*. Ryan deserves to know that their love and support were conditional on things beyond his control. Fitting into their panicked, grief-addled, insane replacement kid plan, sure \u2014 but also the boy part. What if he's not a boy, or not the right kind? That's information he deserves to have too.\n\nOn my soapbox, if you're obsessed with the shape of your kid's genitals and plan your entire parenting style, including how much you love them, around that, you're a bad fucking person and shouldn't have kids. It's way too normalized.", "And then regretting your choice and treating him like a mistake. This is the most disgusting post I\u2019ve read in a while.", "I did some maths here. Jake was 11 when Ryan was born. As the OP mentioned, he was at his sickest at that point.\n\nYou know a baby crying at nights. Your parents looking after someone else, when you can potentially die as a child.\n\nFor Godsakes, you know that he's the replacement, someone who'll be loved after you're gone. Your parents won't miss you.\n\nThat's fucked up.\n\nJake needs to grow up and instead of directing his hate at his brother, he should just go non contact with his parents. \n\nSeriously, they fucked up both the boys.
