I gave him an explanation he needed to hear, because otherwise he'd assume there was something wrong with him he could never fix. That's no way to force your child to live.\"", "NTA.

Good luck.", "I did this for my (half)brothers, too. I wasn't around them much but we had one summer together and I noticed a really bad dynamic between one of them and my dad. One late night, with Dad out of the house and us just \"chatting\" we casually drifted into conversation about my issues with my mom and that led to them both, but mostly one, talking about all their issues. \n\n\"How do you stay so calm and not get so mad at your mom?\" Bro asked. \"Oh, just like our Dad, I know she has mental health issues and that all this drama in her head is about her and not about me.\" Cue stares of \"wha????\" from the bros and it comes out that no one ever told them our dad had mental health issues to the point of being involuntarily (once) and voluntarily (twice) institutionalized.\n\nI then spent some time helping them (I hope) reframe the actions of the dad so that they could understand that it wasn't their fault or responsibility. It was affecting them and it wasn't good - saying \"he has health issues\" is not a \"so therefore it's all good and forgive him\" NOPE. It's \"he does this cuz he's ... and NOT because YOU are the problem\". It doesn't always help, but sometimes it does.\n\nNTA - you are helping Ryan.

But, at least he heard it from someone who has proven she loves him through and through for himself and not as any substitute brother.\n\n NTA. Your parents and Jake on the other hand, really seem like a holes on this particular score?", "NTA\n\nJake and your parents are TAs, though. \nThey had a replacement baby, and are treating him like crap. He did nothing wrong. Jake still gets all the attention, and acts like a brat, so he has no reason to behave the way he does. \n\nSomeone needed to tell Ryan.

He's young, but which is worse, him being told his parents suck, or leaving him to think he is not worthy of love? I hope you can still support Ryan. It sounds like he can use some family that give a crap.", "I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s an ah here but life is seldom simple and I doubt your parents had a whole child as some sort of replacement. This is simplistic and awful thinking. Telling it to a child wasn\u2019t a good idea. How did you think it would make things better? It sounds like the entire family needs therapy from dealing with a very sick child but short of that you maybe need to consider that you don\u2019t have all the answers and what you did was hurtful not just to your little brother but your parents who\u2019ve been thru a lot almost losing a child.", "ESH\n\n\nSo another possibility may be that he wasn\u2019t a replacement but an oops baby. They do happen. We had an adult math teacher who taught his brother. The teacher was probably about 30 (he had taught my sisters so probably out of school for a chunk of time) and his brother was 14. I think Sarah Palin also had an oops baby (her youngest is 14 and oldest 33). \n\n\nSometimes kids who are sick with say cancer or sick in general are babied more. Read about the crazy AITA where the sister has a younger sister who basically had her whole life revolving around her because she had cancer as a kid. In that post the parents even interrupted their aunt\u2019s wedding to say that the sister was okay after she vomited earlier in the day. Kinda sounds similar with how they focus on the kid who formerly had cancer even after they are healthy.\n\n\nHowever, Jake may have viewed the kid as his replacement and that has lead to resentment. \n\n\nThe parents probably have some guilt and fear associated with Jake being sick so they try to avoid upsetting him. After all, who wants a kid that lived through cancer to get upset? Ryan has his health at least. It\u2019s not right but further fuels the fire. \n\n\nI think the boys and the parents need therapy to be honest to process their emotions and feelings about the situations including having a sick kid.", "NTA: Your parents were just fine with making Ryan feel that way, but no one was supposed to actually tell him why?", "NTA. Your parents are awful. Both Ryan and Jake need therapy desperately. They were put in such an awful position by your parents.", "Why does Jake hate Ryan? If the OP is right regarding why the parents had Ryan, I can't imagine they would have told Jake.", ">Your brother deserves to know what happened in the family before he was born.\n\nEspecially as it's still influencing everyone's behaviour and how they are treating him. He was absolutely *entitled* to that info", ">They said I had no right to tell anyone their business or make up horrible conclusions. \n\nYeah, they'd much rather Ryan wallow in self-hatred than aim it at them. NTA OP. Maybe you or your sister can or are willing to help Ryan yeet himself out of that swamp before he's 18.", "The only thing I'm curious about is whether OP is actually right about Ryan being \"the replacement.\" I can certainly see why Jake possibly saw it that way, but it doesn't make it true, either. After all, there's no way the parents could know they would have another boy. What if they'd had a girl?\n\nThere's still clearly an issue regarding the way Ryan is being treated by both Jake and his parents. But the OP mentions their parents are ok with Ryan when Jake is not around. That could imply the whole issue is the typical \"we never do anything to upset the miracle child.\" They bend over backwards for Jake because he was always the favourite AND because he nearly died. Ryan could well have been an accidental pregnancy.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the parents are still the AHs to their youngest by playing favourites. Jake is also being an AH for taking it out on his innocent brother. Even if OPs claim is true, its not Ryan's fault. Its his parents he should be mad at.\n\nBut its also possible that Jake and OP have simply assumed Ryan was a replacement baby because it seems that way to them. But the detail about not being able to choose your baby's gender does make it seem less likely, along with him happening to be born when Ryan was at his sickest. Its not like you can plan ahead and know that you will get pregnant and have a baby be born in time with another child's sickness. Its not impossible, but you'd manage it more on luck than planning. \n\nI'm just thinking that these sort of details are the kind of thing a child would not consider when forming an opinion on a situation. By the time they were adults, the idea was so ingrained that they'd never thought back over the possibilities. Its clear that this notion has never been discussed between the parents and children before.\n\nSo if it isn't true and is just a product of assumption, then OP is a bit of an AH too, because she just stirred the pot and possibly made everything worse. ITs this final part that got to me;\n\n> They said I had no right to tell anyone their business or make up horrible conclusions. I didn't make it up. I know the truth.\n\nThe parents are obviously denying this. OP says they know the truth. But do they, or is it just an assumption? It may be or it may not. We certainly don't know for sure, but it also sounds like OP and Jake don't really know for sure, either. They just come to that conclusion because it seems to fit. But its still just an assumption and assumption is the mother of all fuckups.\n\nI don't think I could call judgement on this one because there's no way to be sure of what is accurate. I do think the parents and Jake need to sort their shit out, though. Whatever the reasons, they're hurting Ryan for something that is not his fault.", "Parents can forget that children as siblings are their own organism - not just extensions of those parents.

In that case, it doesn't matter the gender of the last kid. He's just here the save the older one.", "Yeah, I think that the replacement part absolutely could be Jake's assumption, and incorrect. It's just as likely the parents fell into a pattern of bending themselves around Jake because he was going to die, not reprimanding him or in any way pushing back his assumptions, and instead treating Ryan like shit to keep Jake happy. Still asshole behavior, still requiring therapy all around, but none of it requires the replacement hypothesis to be truth. So if OP related this to Ryan as truth, that his parents don't really care about him because Jake didn't need replacing, then OP gets into AH territory too. Also, therapy territory, I suspect, since this must have been so hard on the sisters too", "I agree. ESH", "When OP essentially wrote that \"Ryan is the problem for this conflict\" I knew I couldn't be on her side.

The kid isn't stupid, he understands what's going on around him...  He was probably already putting the pieces together..  All his parents are doing if causing problem for the future.\n\nI also expect, that ppl don't drop a bomb on a child to let him cope with what they just learned.  Imagine being that child and learning what he did, then just leaving him there to deal with it all.. \n\nSo now he knows the truth, what now?  Doesn't sound like their getting him therapy, but now he knows why he's hated, why his parent treated him different and that he was a spear \"just in case.\" but by all means, tell the kid the truth", "I hope that OP and her sister are in therapy too.

Imagine their chosen one heir turned out to be uninterested in having children of their own, was a trans woman, infertile, or just plain fucked right out of their lives because of this crap. Would they ditch him and have another one? Would they suddenly love the one they consider an extra and a burden? This is all very messed up.

Someone needs to step up and be an advocate for Ryan and his needs. Hell I'd be tempted to move out and seek custody of Ryan...", "NTA. Ryan deserves to know the truth.

Ryan could probably also use therapy too.", "NTA, but what else are you doing to support your brother? Lighting a fuse and walking away is pretty reckless.", "NTA. Your parents and Jake (to a lesser extent) are the AHs.", "NTA how sad", "NTA. Your brother needs context to the neglect and abuse he\u2019s suffered.  If he knows the problem is his parents then he knows it\u2019s not him. I think your parents and brother would prefer he did though. And their reaction is either evidence of that or surprise that  was your conclusion. Either way it wasn\u2019t a denial. Furthermore, how is it NOT his business?! He\u2019s entitled to know why he is being treated the way he is. \nYour parents and Jake need a good swift kick to the rear. And possibly more.", "NTA\nGlad to hear your brother has been in remission! But what a lousy situation that really didn\u2019t need to be this way. I think telling Ryan the real reason- upsetting as it is- is better than letting him fill in the blanks to understand why his brother hates him. Feeling unwanted or unloved by parents and older siblings is profoundly damaging to a child and those impacts last a lifetime if not dealt with. \nThe comment Jake made about being thankful for parents and sisters - intentionally excluding his younger brother- was immature and petty. Your parents punishing Ryan for his reaction and ignoring him when Jake is around is also petty, immature and cruel.\nYou did the right thing here and Ryan will remember that. He\u2019ll remember that you risked everyone being upset at you for standing up for him. It\u2019s easy to think that the difference of one person being on your side is minimal, and that might be true when it is the difference between 4 and 5 people for instance, but if it is the difference between 0 and 1 that is massive and can literally make all the difference.\nI\u2019ve had some serious health issues myself and fortunately am clear of them now, but I do get that it can be very emotional and confusing even as an adult, so if he was at his sickest when he was young that had to be extra rough, so I can have some empathy for Jake here to a point but after a decade certainly a person needs to be doing some work on himself to stop carrying that emotion and taking it out on people around him.", "NTA. Can you imagine how much of your brother's life up to now has been spent trying to figure out what he did wrong to make his parents aloof and his brother despise him? You did him a huge favor. He doesn't have to work that shift anymore. He knows it isn't anything he did or anything he can fix. He can put the energy he used trying to gain acceptance to find others who like him for who he is.", "This family dynamic sounds toxic as hell; the least anyone could do is tell the kid who's too young to extricate himself from it the truth about *why* it's like that. NTA.", "NTA. And tell your parents they are the one who fucked up and were horrible parents.\nIt might be a hard duty, but hopefully you and your older sister can give Ryan the love he deserves", "NTA, Ryan deserves to know the truth so that he can at the very least internalize that this dynamic isn't his fault and that there's nothing inherently wrong with him. \n\nJake, my heart goes out to him and I cannot imagine how much it must have hurt to be at your sickest when a newborn is brought into the house. Jake deserved so much better. You deserved so much better. But Jake continuing to direct this energy towards Ryan present day is wrong and cruel, no matter how valid and painful Jake's feelings here are. Ryan doesn't deserve to be punished, hurt, or excluded for circumstances around his existence that are entirely out of his control. I'm not saying Jake should drop all of his own feelings and pretend to be a doting brother to Ryan, but he also shouldn't be making such an effort to make it clear to Ryan how much negativity he garners towards him. \n\nJake is an adult man, he is the same age as I am right now. I'm no stranger to severe illness and sickness and how it impacts a family's overall health and well-being. Jake is an adult man here, and Ryan is a child. It is no longer appropriate for Jake to direct so much blame and hostility towards Ryan over circumstances that were entirely out of Ryan's control. Especially when your parents already make a point of de-prioritizing Ryan in order to cater to Jake here. How aware is Jake of this dynamic? Does he understand how his parents are treating Ryan to cater to him? Has he ever once acknowledged that it's not Ryan's fault for being brought into existence? That he didn't ask to be born and that he didn't will himself into existence to spite Jake? \n\nI'm less concerned about the parents, despite them being the ringleaders of all of this dysfunction and toxicity, than I am about Jake. Because if Ryan can see that his older siblings reject his parents' mentalities and reasoning to their abusive treatment, then he can learn from that and understand that there is a better and healthier world waiting for him when he's older. The biggest source of negative impact here would be a sibling that supports this disparate treatment and reinforces notions like him being a justifiable target for blame and malice. This can create a lot of cascading mental and even physical health issues down the road. I would ask Jake if that's what he wants? Does he want Ryan growing up sad, confused, feeling excluded from his own family - over circumstances entirely out of control? Does he want Ryan to have self-esteem issues? Does he want Ryan to develop anxiety and depression? Does he want Ryan to believe that he is unwanted, or a burden, or a mistake? Why does he want Ryan to believe this? \n\nThese are big and powerful questions that I assume even you don't have the answer to. And he most likely won't answer those questions honestly outside of a confidential setting. He needs to confront his own desire to see a child hurting, especially now that he's an adult. He owes it to himself and the relatives he actually wants in his life to put in the work to unlearn this misdirected blame and malice. Otherwise, Ryan will continue to suffer and Jake will never see a true way forwards from all of the pain he's experienced growing up. If Ryan can see that his siblings denounce this treatment, and affirm to him that he deserves better, that alone can be enough to mitigate a humongous portion of this damage and hurt. But if Ryan sees Jake insist on the current dysfunctional dynamic as well-deserved, that causes the greatest potential for lasting mental health issues for Ryan.", "NTA but your parents and Jake absolutely are.", "YTA and I may be in the minority, but he\u2019s 12!

That's what their mad about. Because Ryan knowing the truth means they have to face the consequences of their actions and address the situation thats been the elephant in the room for 12 years.

I would tell your parents \"You lied to him for his entire life to make yourselves feel better without a single thought to how it would effect Ryan.

They said I had no right to tell anyone their business or make up horrible conclusions. I didn't make it up. I know the truth.\n\nNTA. Good for you!\n\nFamilies who keep massive secrets are horribly toxic. You showed Ryan that you prioritized him over the parents demand for secrecy. That's amazing for your 12yo brother.\n\nAs much as learning the truth must suck for him, the fact you were brave enough to be honest is huge. Huge for you. Huge for Ryan. And huge for the normal sibling relationship the two of you can have going forward. You're his damn hero right now.

I agonize over my word choices with my 5 year old so I'm not 'blaming the baby' so to speak, when my daughter asks me to do something and my hands are full.

They said they didn't want another kid and now they're having one. I feel like I'm being replaced. Kids often have main character syndrome and assume everything is about them, when it often isn't.\n\nAnother thing that makes me doubt it is why have the \"replacement baby,\" before Jake died? OP assumes they were replacing Jake because the baby was born when Jake was at his worst. But that would just make the parents' lives hell. A new baby and a very sick child isn't a good combination. If they were really as heartless as this notion suggests, you'd \"replace,\" the child after they've gone, when its easier to cope. That and the whole \"impossible to predict the sex,\" really make it seem not as obvious as OP suggests.\n\nAgain, not to say I think its definitely not true, but only that there's enough details that make it not entirely make sense.\n\nThe biggest problem with this family seems to be that everyone has kept their thoughts and feelings to themselves. Nothing has ever been discussed. They've all got these pent-up feelings of anger and resentment, thoughts and beliefs that have never been expressed and its all built up to boiling point and caused all this. The whole lot of them need to get into therapy and get some professional help where they can actually talk this out and express their feelings in a controlled environment.
