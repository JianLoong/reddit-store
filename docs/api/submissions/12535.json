This is not acceptable behavior, even jokingly, between friends. It sounds like she is too afraid to \"lose a friend\"so she brushes it off, but this is concerning because this is teaching her that people who are supposed to be your friend treat you this way. Not cool at all.", "NTA. You had a concern. You told her. What she does with the information is up to her.", "INFO: does she banter with him like this as well? Or is he the only one?", "NTA. If anyone talked to my sister this way in my presence, teeth would be send flying.\n\nOn a serious note, did you ask her WHY she's actually friends with the guy? Are there any positives other than him actually being willing to spend time with her (sadly, a big enough pro if you're an awkward loner)?", "NTA She needs to get as far away from him as possible. He is an absolute dick and has crossed too many lines. Your sister is way too lenient as well, maybe tell a parent/guardian about this.", "NTA. This sounds way out of line, but if I had to guess, this boy is being mean because he likes her. That doesn\u2019t make it okay, but if your sister is insistent that it\u2019s fine, maybe she likes him too and is brushing off his behavior because of it? Idk, I\u2019m just theorizing.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t get too involved until you know more about the nature of their relationship. Ask your sis questions!", "NAH, but once is enough to bring this up IMO. Your sister is allowed to pick who she wants to hang out with, even if it's this little asshole, and continually going on about it will only have the opposite effect you're looking for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think some more context is needed though. I can see how to some, behaviour like this is absolutely unacceptable, but different friends do have different tolerances. Me and my buddies say stuff similar to this about each other all of the time, but we think it's funny and don't take it personally, and each person has a clear boundary we try not to cross. In a reply to another comment though, I saw you mentioned that she never says anything similar to what he says. This leads me to believe (and massive speculation btw) that she might just be putting up with it for the sake of keeping the friendship. If this is the case, then it might be worth encouraging her to talk back, because at that point it feels like a subtle way of bullying. At the end of the day though, any response has to come from her, and needs to be fully her choice.\n\nEDIT: When I say talk back I mean talk about it, not just insult him", "NTA. \n\nAnd I think it\u2019s great idea to give your little sister a heads up on what a healthy friendship/relationship should look like. You don\u2019t want her to her normalized to abusive behavior so early on in life.", "NTA, does she have a crush on the friend or vice versa? This sounds like teenage negging and you are doing right by being protective of her and letting her know that this is not a healthy way to be friends", "I don't really feel like anyone has enough knowledge to vote on this one, all relationships are different and I would know as I am often on the receiving end of these jokes. While yes the situation may be different and all the n t a comments are right voting on that assumption is simply strange to me especially when the sister says it's fine\n\nEdit: NAH", "She does banter a bit, but to a far less degree than him and I\u2019ve never heard her say something I believe crossed a line", "My mind has me thinking she likes him maybe more than a friend? So she is willing to take the abuse? In which I feel your concern is warranted!!"]}
