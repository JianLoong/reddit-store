You mean the book where the author admitted he made it all up and none of it actually happened? A book that is entirely *fiction* and is widely considered to be one of the worst financial books ever authored?\n\nNTA. Your dad needs to to read more current events.", "Oh 100% NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy is it that he doesn't want you reading fiction books? Fiction books are educational. Studies literally show reading fiction helps people develop empathy, theory of mind, and critical thinking. It increases creativity and gives perspective and insights to many different real life problems shown through the lense of a fictional world and helps you understand the complexity of and get familiar with various characters you you might not meet in real life, and if you do, you're prepared because you already are familiar with their personality types.\n\nIn the same way he wouldn't like if someone told him to read fiction, he can't tell you to read non-fiction. You could always drop the library and just start reading books online. Or even audiobooks, so it looks like you're listening to music.\n\nDon't let your mind dull and your passions dwindle because of his own preference in books", "NTA Many self help books, the the Rich, Poor one, you mention ARE fiction! I am so happy to see someone reading! A lot can be learned from fiction and you can attain interests in other areas because of it. Hope your dad comes to realize this!", "NTA. He may mean well but he\u2019s going to ruin your enjoyment of reading if he tries forcing subjects down your throat.", "NTA. I have a feeling that even if you borrowed a school library book, or you bought a fiction book with your own money, that your dad would confiscate it. I suggest downloading an e-reader app like kindle. Also, many libraries have digital books available to read online now, so you should still be able to get your fiction fix. Good luck OP, from a fellow fiction lover.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd as a lifelong bibliophile (I read my first words at the age of 2 and haven't stopped since), former educator AND former literary agent, while I hesitate to call anyone I don't know personally \"a fool\" outright, I will say that your father is absolutely BEING foolish. And very, very ignorant.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason that you cannot learn all kinds of things from reading fiction. Of course, it depends to some extent on the sort of fiction that you read - realistic fiction is probably going to teach you more directly about the world around you than fantasy - but even well-written fantasy will expose you to new vocabulary, new ideas and perspectives, and give you tools for critical analysis and seeing through someone else's eyes. Every single well-composed story that you read should have something for you to learn from it. \n\nAnd I can tell you, as a former publishing professional that good authors of fiction do EXTENSIVE research to make the worlds they create feel authentic. \n\nYour father's attitude is deeply ironic because his own understanding of how humans learn is deeply, deeply limited, and he is literally asking you to limit yourself drastically, to STOP learning in complex and challenging ways that require you to use genuine analytical skills to mine the things you're reading for new information that isn't presented in an obvious way, and instead to only read things that spoon-feed you simplistic \"lessons\" that may or may not be relevant to your life, but that will not help you flex your \"critical thinking muscles\" as it were. Even when it comes to non-fiction (which I happen to love), there are so many more interesting things to read than the types of books he's talking about: memoirs of fascinating people; ethnographies that explore other cultures; books that explore incredible phenomena in our world. What he's talking about are shallow, trendy, pop-culture nonsense that are mostly written to line the pockets of the authors. There's nothing meaningful to learn from them, and they certainly aren't educational in any substantive way. \n\nOf course you're NTA. I'm really sorry that your father is discouraging you from GENUINELY expanding your interests and your education through reading. It makes me really sad for both of you.", "NTA.\n\nYour father is the AH here. Any reading should be encouraged. Reading should be a journey of discovery, where you consume a lot and find what you like.\n\nIf your father is otherwise reasonable, maybe you can get some books that you like and one book that he would be content with. But I get the feeling that's not the case and that this is a symptom of a larger issue.\n\nSomething tells me in a few years you'll have had enough of his controlling behavior, go NC, and he'll be scratching his head, wondering why.", "NTA \n \nCall his bluff. He doesn\u2019t want you to read anything but non-fiction? Fine. Don\u2019t read anything. \n \nTell him you\u2019re not going to read non-fiction and calmly tell him that if he won\u2019t allow you to read at all, then your options at that point are TV and video games. Ask him which one of those he would prefer, since reading for enjoyment is apparently not acceptable. \n \nAlso, please point out to him that many many life lessons can be found in fictional books. Some are even used to *teach* lessons. Thinking specifically here about Enders Game being used at one of the military academies in the US, but there are a ton more examples. \n \nOnce things calm down, maybe propose a compromise? If he wants you to read Atomic Habits then ok, but you get to read 2 of the books *you* want to read for every 1 book he wants you to read. And also *he* has to read Atomic Habits at the same time. Hell, make it a thing where he also has to read a fiction book that you recommend. \n \nI\u2019m a sci-fi/fantasy author, and what people don\u2019t understand about fiction (especially specfic) is how it can contain huge, important, difficult, real-life concepts and problems in a story about a space Cowboy. Or whatever. \n \nAnd Atomic Habits is great, for what it is. I\u2019ve read it, I found it useful. But to be able to accomplish things, to create or work or learn, people *must* take the time to fill their own well first. You have to spend time doing things you love, consuming media that gives you joy and satisfaction, finding ways to deal with stress, resting both your mind and your body, etc before you can tackle whatever work/school/life challenges you are going to face. \n \nNo one can exist on just self-help books and \u201cproductive\u201d content. Human minds need beauty, art, joy, and wonder to be healthy and strong. \n \nFor him to be upset that you find that in books is wild to me. Because the thing is, the human brain *needs* outlets. It\u2019s not an option, you *must* have a way to de-stress and some kind of creative input. \n \nSo if he takes away fiction books, your brain is going to *force* you to find another option. So which option would he prefer? Video games? TV? (Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with either of those! But he sounds like the type who would hate that even more) Would he prefer you start avoiding being at home because you\u2019re bored there, and instead hanging out with random people? Where he doesn\u2019t know where you are or what you\u2019re doing? \n \nOr if none of those are an option, then would he prefer that you just what\u2026 build up more and more stress without an outlet? Stare blankly into space? What? \n \nHe should be ecstatic that his kid loves to read, no matter the content. You\u2019re learning useful, important things with every book you pick up. Interpersonal relationships, problem solving, thinking outside the box, about prejudice and perseverance, about staying true to yourself, or figuring out who you are in the first place, about hard work, about grief and loss and love and\u2026 and at the very least you\u2019re learning about language, sentence structure, etc \n \nIt\u2019s not just \u201cfiction\u201d the way he probably thinks about it.  \n \nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "NTA \n\nAnd apply for your own card! Even if the normal route is for a minors card to be listed under a parent, there might be program exceptions.", "NTA, you can read what you want. I love reading fiction. Can\u2019t get enough. My daughter 14 doesn\u2019t really like to read much at all in general. Is that a bummer? Yes. But that\u2019s her. She reads graphic novels sometimes and she reads what she needs to for school, that\u2019s good enough for me.", "NTA\n\nAnd i would very much like to hear his reasoning.", "NTA. Your dad should be happy that you want to read. Does your school have a library you can rent books from instead? That way you can still read the books you like without having to rely on your dad to take you to the library.", "NTA. I maintain that reading bodice ripping romance novels when I was young is entirely the reason my vocabulary improved.  Lots of descriptive passages.  Do you have access to a school library?", "NTA\n\nGoing to the library, borrowing or renting books should be a private event - for fun and pleasure.\n\nI don;t know how old you are, but you need to get your own subscription (and go there alone, or borrow digital copies on a tablet).\n\nThis is not right, and it spells \"red flag\" for me.", "NTA.  Your father seems to be very controlling.  He's probably pushing you to get into academics that he deems worthy even if you don't enjoy them.  Apply for your own library card and go without him.", "NTA \n\nMy parents were the same way when I was growing up, constantly told me it was stupid and foolish of me to read fiction books. That I was wasting my time. No worries buddy, someday, sooner than you can think of you'll have your own place and then you can build your own library at home full of fiction books. \n\nIf you want to read fiction without needing a ride to the library feel free to check out this site: \n\nreadanybook.com \n\nIt's free! Have fun!", "NTA - Your dad probably means well but he shouldn't try to make you read outdated non-fiction. I love reading fiction a lot! However, I also read non-fiction once a while to learn skills applicable for my daily life. It can't hurt to give age-appropriate N-F a try.\n\nAtomic Habits is an interesting read but it's useless if you're not interested in changing habits or making healthy, new ones. Surrounded by idiots by Thomas Erikson is probably better for a YA.\n\nIf your dad is hell-bent on getting you to read some N-F, you can strike a deal that you'll read *one* N-F but the rest fiction. Or at least give it a try. It shouldn't be the requirement for him driving you to the library though.", "NTA. You are reading and you enjoy it. That is the important part. Your dad was being obnoxious. If you can, I highly suggest digital books using Overdrive or Libby.", "NTA I can't get over the idea that he started yelling and saying OP was causing a scene in public. Uhm, walking fast to the car is NOT causing a scene, but someone yelling in a parking lot IS definitely \"scene\" behavior. \n\nI am really sorry that your dad is giving you such a hard time. The suggestions for compromise are good ideas, pick a book he likes, and one you like, that way you can at least placate him.  How will he know if you ACTUALLY read the books he picks out? Is he going to quiz you on them? I mean, you can't really FORCE someone to read something they don't find interesting, I fall asleep reading most history books, but science books, I will devour.\n\nMaybe you could read some non-fiction books about a subject you DO find interesting? Historical people, places or events that interest you? What type of fiction do you enjoy? There are probably some non-fiction books that align with a genre you like. Like if you like James Patterson, he does murder mysteries, I know there are books about real life murders that are non-fiction. If you like fantasy, some of the ancient Greek, Egyptian and Roman history stuff has some elements of mythology in it, as well as Joseph Campbell's books on ancient mythology. And like a couple people said Rich Dad, Poor Dad IS total fiction, so, you could read it and laugh at the stuff the guy made up... \n\nI really hope your dad can see the value in a compromise, if not, I am really sorry and please don't let this diminish your love of reading. You can take it up again when you leave home.", "NTA. I'm guessing this guy hasn't read books like the American girls, Dear America, etc. Because they are fiction but they are also based on true events. The fact he wants you to read self help books is kind of weird. You're not saying your age but I'm going to guess under fifteen. This is very controlling. If you have access to a computer there is  plenty of free books and reading you can do.  Also is your mom in the picture or is she just going to side with him without hearing your reasoning?", "Your library should have an online card/book checkout so you can read what you want.

Brilliant strategy, Dad!\n\nYou are NTA.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of fascinating non-fiction books we could recommend, but the self-help books (most self-help books, really) your father wants to cram down your throat sound like hot garbage.", "NTA, but a good solution would be to make a deal. Like 3 books you want + 1 book that he likes.\n\nAnd reading a \"boring\" books once in a while doesn't hurt.", "NTA explain the issue to the librarian. They can suggest authors that write fiction and non-fiction both. Asimov comes to mind.", "NTA - it\u2019s pretty dumb that he would prefer you read nothing over fiction.", "Nta\n\nNext time, pick out the \u201ccommunist manifesto\u201d by Karl Marx or a \u201cour bodies, ourselves\u201d or \u201ccritical race theory, an introduction\u201d (multiple authors)\n\nHe may be more tolerant next time you want to check out Dune, I Robot, Lord of the Rings and other great works", "NTA - your father should be happy that he has a child who is keen on reading, rather than discourage it with silly ultimatums. I do like the 3-for-you-1-for-him compromise people suggested, but would add that you might want to look (within that spread) for non-fiction books on topics you might actually enjoy. \n\nWhen I was 10 I gobbled up all sorts of books about archaeology (yes, I know - I was a weird kid), learning tons of stuff about pre-Colombian and Egyptian civilizations along the way. The story of the discovery of Troy or the grave of Tut Ankh Amun is pretty cool! I was interested in \"the Wild West\" too, so mixed up my \"westerns\" fiction reading with history books about American indigenous peoples (which gave me a huge advantage in the playground when we played \"cowboys and Indians\"). You like animals? Look for books like Farley Mowat's \"Never Cry Wolf\" or \"Owls in the Family\" - they read like fiction, but aren't, and you learn all sorts of stuff about animal behaviour in the process. \n\nGood luck, OP. You don't tell us how old you are, but I hope you have a lifetime of reading discoveries ahead of you.", "Check out The Gutenberg project - it has free copies of public domain books online.
