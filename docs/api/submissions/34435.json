There is no intimacy, no emotional connection, no sex, no exchange of STIs etc inherently involved in putting photos online on only fans.\n\nIf people get off to her feet, how is that different to them getting off to someone else's feet? Would you recognise your wife's feet in a photo out of context?\n\nPerhaps you could try being more supportive of your wife. For example, she's in a really bad job, can you help alleviate the pressures she's under? She's clearly worried about money, can you revisit your shared financial arrangements and make any necessary adjustments so she doesn't feel so stressed about money? Can you help her find a better job? Are you working full time? If not, can you get more hours? If you are, are the expenses split 50:50 or proportional to income? Could that be adjusted to help?\n\nAddressing the actual issue causing her to think of other ways to make some money might mean she doesn't feel the need to create a side hustle.\n\nIf she really wants to go forward with taking photos of her feet and selling them via only fans, can you work with her to create some agreeable boundaries there? For example discussing what she plans to do about requests and creepy messages? She is probably interested because she's read something that suggested it's a super easy way to make money, but that isn't true anymore. You could also ask that it be something you do together.\n\nFinally, it sounds like your emotional connection is quite frayed at the moment. You're not on the same page, you're not moving forward together to the same goal. Try to reconnect with her. Be present with her. Listen to her concerns. Express your own concerns.

It's something you are uncomfortable with and don't want your SO to engage in, as it is in essence, as you already stated, a sexual interaction between two people. Her being pissed off at you is a totally valid reaction, as she's probably frustrated that's not a possible backup option. However, being in a commitment you have to accept your partner's boundaries and needs and respect them. Photos of feet may not be necessarily considered \"sexual\" to most in comparison to the other content that gets shared on selling platforms, but to the people buying that material it certainly is.
