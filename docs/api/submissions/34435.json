There is no intimacy, no emotional connection, no sex, no exchange of STIs etc inherently involved in putting photos online on only fans.\n\nIf people get off to her feet, how is that different to them getting off to someone else's feet? Would you recognise your wife's feet in a photo out of context?\n\nPerhaps you could try being more supportive of your wife. For example, she's in a really bad job, can you help alleviate the pressures she's under? She's clearly worried about money, can you revisit your shared financial arrangements and make any necessary adjustments so she doesn't feel so stressed about money? Can you help her find a better job? Are you working full time? If not, can you get more hours? If you are, are the expenses split 50:50 or proportional to income? Could that be adjusted to help?\n\nAddressing the actual issue causing her to think of other ways to make some money might mean she doesn't feel the need to create a side hustle.\n\nIf she really wants to go forward with taking photos of her feet and selling them via only fans, can you work with her to create some agreeable boundaries there? For example discussing what she plans to do about requests and creepy messages? She is probably interested because she's read something that suggested it's a super easy way to make money, but that isn't true anymore. You could also ask that it be something you do together.\n\nFinally, it sounds like your emotional connection is quite frayed at the moment. You're not on the same page, you're not moving forward together to the same goal. Try to reconnect with her. Be present with her. Listen to her concerns. Express your own concerns.

It's something you are uncomfortable with and don't want your SO to engage in, as it is in essence, as you already stated, a sexual interaction between two people. Her being pissed off at you is a totally valid reaction, as she's probably frustrated that's not a possible backup option. However, being in a commitment you have to accept your partner's boundaries and needs and respect them. Photos of feet may not be necessarily considered \"sexual\" to most in comparison to the other content that gets shared on selling platforms, but to the people buying that material it certainly is.

It\u2019s totally normal for OP to not want his wife to post basically porn of herself online (because that\u2019s what the context would be, no one looking at \u201cfeet pics\u201d is doing it for science). It\u2019s just like him not wanting her to kiss, date, or more with anyone else. They\u2019re in a committed relationship and this is a normal boundary", "Lengths? Self righteous? I asked a question.

Then, when she does not make any money from that, she will need to chat with men that reach out or post more risqu\u00e9 content. There are plenty of free feet pictures online - that\u2019s not what these men are paying for on OF. \n\nOnce OP says yes to his wife becoming a sex worker, that\u2019s a can of worms that can never be closed and may well end in the wife asking for an open relationship.

You're hellbent on making this a \"man orders woman around\" when it's clearly not.

Maybe take your cat to the vet", "It\u2019s definitely a lot of work, and they probably have to put up with a bunch of dehumanizing and gross creeps to get the real money. \n\nCan confirm- without knowing the details it seems like a nice cop out, as a woman.

But I can\u2019t dance and don\u2019t want people grabbing me, sugar daddies expect \u201cfavors,\u201d and posting pics and maintaining clients is mentally and physically exhausting. \n\nIt\u2019s nice to think it would be easy - just be hot and men will pay for you.
