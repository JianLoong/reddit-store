Sounds like you truly care and are doing the best you can. Everyone saying you\u2019re the AH, just makes me think back to the hell I raised for my parents as a teenage girl from 13-16.. TRULY. Now that I have a 3 &1 year old daughter I know it\u2019s coming. But you are right, ONE WEEK at moms and showing her the magnitude of her words is really just the tip of A NAIL as to what it\u2019d be like if she truly lost you.

Take her out to eat and explain that you didn\u2019t want to isolate her but what she said hurt you so much. Ask her how she\u2019s really feeling and why.. what you can do to help her as she\u2019s growing into a young adult since life can be so confusing as a teenage girl (especially if mom is lacking) \u2026 and lastly set boundaries with each other, even with the language you use with one another, if that\u2019s important to you.

Or better yet, you could have just left her alone until her anger calmed down and she was ready to talk. Then you could have explained how what she said was wrong, but you also could have listened to her about her feelings. \n\nEDIT 1: I'd also like to add that one of the most important rules is to never threaten to kick your child out of the house because it gives them a feeling that they don't really have a home and place to stay. I don't see how this situation is any different. You removed her from the place she calls a home and put her with a cold and distant parent (as you claim the mother is) that she doesn't like being around because you were upset at what she said. This shows that her feeling safe and cared for in your house (her home) is *conditional* instead of a right. Not good for children's mental health.\n\nEDIT2: It seems some people are misunderstanding me. The \"walking away and talking it through later\" is *not* the consequence. That is to just better understand the situation and deescalate. I'm not implying she doesn't need consequences for what she said. She does. What I'm saying is that OP's consequence is *harsh* and I don't think it was the best course of action because of edit 1 and my italicized portion.", "NTA.

What you did was heartless and may cause lifelong trauma for her.   You were the one parent she could rely on and now she won't feel safe with you either.  Hope you're proud of yourself!\n\nYou could have grounded her, you could have taken her phone away, you could have done so many things that would have been a normal parent response but instead you got rid of her and took her to the one place you know would hurt her.", "Maybe not the first day but now, yeah, YTA. Do you not know that teenagers have difficulty with impulse control and say things like that they don't mean? Unless they are terrified of you. I would never say that to one of my parents as a teen because I wouldn't have any teeth afterwards. The fact she's not afraid of losing your love or being hurt by you so she said it should show you that. She's apologized and is begging to come back. How can you be so heartless?", "YTA. You're the adult. When your kid has an absolutely developmentally appropriate emotional outburst your job is to talk to them, and give them consequences that teach them that lashing out and being hurtful isn't okay, like spending quiet time without their devices and TV, thinking about what they said, so that they can apologize for it meaningfully. She also needs to do that with her teacher. \n\nBut instead what you've taught her is that if she hurts your feelings, you'll abandon her. What she said wasn't a death threat or a real wish, it was venting. If she'd said \"I wish I'd never been born\" would you spend days ignoring her to pretend like she was never born? No, because that wouldn't have hurt *your* feelings. You're treating your unregulated emotional response to her words as valid, and her unregulated emotional response as a crime in need of punishment. You both need some emotional maturity, but she's 14. What's your excuse?", "YTA. Our job as parents is to, you know, PARENT through these moments. And that sometimes means being an adult in the face of some truly wild shit our kids can say! it means putting aside your own anger and hurt to recognize that this is your \\*child\\* Your child who said a very fucked up thing (and I DID lose my dad at 14, so I get how ugly this was.) But instead of being the adult, you're doing a, \"WELL, LET'S SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT, THEN!\" thing that is not going to read to her as, \"Ah, a consequence,\" but just revenge for hurting your feelings, basically. Text her back, ffs, and possibly look at family therapy for a bit. I cannot imagine my teenager texting me that they were sorry and wanted to come home, and me just...leaving them on read because they said a mean thing. All this is doing is teaching her that if she fucks up, you'll throw your hands up and freeze her out.", "YTA. You can\u2019t hold something a CHILD said to you in anger and frustration against them like that. At her age, this kind of rejection is incredibly traumatic. She\u2019s still developing, and the teen years are when we\u2019re supposed to be our most selfish. You can\u2019t let your own emotions cloud your judgement like that. I\u2019m a high school teacher- I see and hear about all kinds of ways that parents screw up their kids, and/ or their relationship with their kids. You need to fix it immediately- apologise for this treatment of her, be honest about how her comment made you feel, and then make a plan about how you can move on together.", "YTA. This is going to be traumatic for her. You're her parent and you're treating her like an enemy and being really immature. Ignoring her texts? Making her stay somewhere she's unhappy? This is really harsh punishment and is going to mess her up. \n\nYou should know that teens say things like that, they can't emotionally regulate and even adutls say things they don't mean in the heat of the moment. She regrets it. You didn't have to dole out such harsh and prolonged punishment because she used some harsh words in anger. Model emotional regulation and empathy and she will learn it too. Model harshness and that's what she'll pick up on.", "NAH\n\nLook, I get that what she said made you very upset and angry and obviously, that was uncalled for and downright horrible of her. But here's the thing: During puberty, the brain changes which causes chaos and confusion. Which means, that sometimes, teenagers genuinely don't know what they're doing and what they're saying. So don't be too hard on her.", "I would say YTA because when I was younger, I was a runaway and a lot of people whose parents acted this way ended up being runaways, and my parents did this to my older brother and he came back on meth before he eventually left again\n\nSo honestly, whether or not it really is whitea, I can tell you that this shit backfires often", "YTA.\n\nShe\u2019s a child, you are an adult\u2026 act like it. \n\nUse your words to explain to her that you have been hurt and needed some space to process and calm down. Ignoring her is a shitty thing to do, and ditching her altogether is unforgivable.", "One thing I know, as a divorced parent, is that it can be extra hard to keep your cool when *you* know how much you're constantly doing for your kid.

Did you ask your daughter why she got in a fight with her teacher and why she felt like her teacher deserved it? It doesn't sound like you did. \n\nInstead, you hurt your daughter for hurting your feelings. You are the parent, and you need to realize that you can't put your feelings before your child's.

This will affect their relationship in so many ways, and probably going to affect her future relationships even more. \n\nFrom OP\u2019s post, we don\u2019t know if she called the teacher a bitch in her face - she was rude, for an unknown reason (maybe the teacher was rude as well? maybe something happened in class and she just tried to defend herself), and then was venting to her dad, which, actually, is a GOOD sign. Rather than forcing to apologize, OP should have gone through the situation with her, try to look for other ways to cope and then help her handle the situation - and consequences. \n\nSame goes with yelling \u201ci wish you were dead\u201d at him. She\u2019s a TEENAGER. If you don\u2019t have the nerve to handle things like this in an adult way, don\u2019t become a parent, really. Moreover, the primary thing in moderating behavior is showing consequences - the consequence of what she said should be her father telling her how it made her feel, and allowing her to try and fix things. Kicking her out showed her different consequence: I say something my dad doesn\u2019t like when I\u2019m angry, he kicks me out. I have to censor myself and tiptoe around him to be able to feel safe and loved. He\u2019s not going to help me cope with my difficult feelings, so I have to suppress or hide them. This is her only learning from this, until OP gets his shit together to act like an adult. If he wanted to give her direct consequences of what she said (him being dead), he would have to actually drop dead here and there, not abandon her - she knows he\u2019s not dead. She\u2019s 14, not an idiot \ud83d\ude06\n\nEither she is just a child, in which case he should help her work through this, learn how to communicate anger and frustration in a constructive way, communicate her boundaries and calm down.

I hated a few of my teachers throughout school...because they were adults making me do things I didn't want to do..it's not always some underlying ominous issue by the teacher. She's 14, not 4. She knows calling her teacher a bitch is wrong and refusing to apologize is as well. She knows telling the parent that takes care of you and loves you that they wish you were dead is wrong too. I think his response is perfect...wish me dead, do you?? Here's what your life will look like if I was. Brilliant, really.

Ok.", "Only on Reddit do people immediately jump to no contact over every single dispute.", "Sit down and have an actual conversation with her about how she\u2019s feeling and how her words and behavior made him feel.", "Right. I have real reasons like every time she hit me, each picture she took. She doesn't, which means she's having a hard time with dad not taking her side in a situation involving the teacher where the daughter was wrong. This girl needed to be taught how her words affect people. Spending a few days with her mother isn't going to do anything but teach her that words hurt people. He shouldn't have just told her to get in the car. I would've said \"You really hurt me, and for the time being, I think it would be best if we spent some time apart. I'm going to take you to your mother's house for a few days and when I pick you up, we can talk about it.\" \n\nI think what he did was a great learning experience, he just didn't handle it or word it well.", "He sent her to her moms house, he never said she could never come back. I don't see the issue here, she is facing consequences of her actions. Words have consequences, it's better to learn this as a teenager than as an adult.", "I couldn\u2019t agree more and it\u2019s actually pretty awful to read some of the other comments.\n\nPeople keep saying that oh, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s been sent to someone abusive, it\u2019s her parent for god\u2019s sake but a parent being cold and distant to their child can absolutely be emotional abuse. In any case, you are entirely right that if the dad is saying that, the daughter is 1000% feeling it so much stronger.\n\nAlthough who cares about her right, she\u2019s 14 and that means she should act like an adult /s\n\nSome people are clearly only here to be applauded and pat on the back because they were apparently the most perfect teenager ever and are just so eager to tell everyone how much better they are than this FOURTEEN YEAR OLD. \ud83d\ude44", "No they didn\u2019t, or you wouldn\u2019t have done it.\n\nAlso, he is teaching her words mean something. The crazies like you want to pretend it\u2019s abuse. Nope just consequences.", "Correct. But children need to learn at home so they don't go into the workforce as brats. And I don't mean \"I won't work for minimum wage\"- that's fine! More power to the workers! I mean the kind of people who say \"Fuck you!\", verbatim, if you ask them to do something in their job description.\n\nOr scream at professors for not giving them the grade they want. Or scream at fast food workers. Or a host of other things.\n\nEvery day on here we see stories about spoiled kids, people acting like assholes, spoiled family members, etc. How do they learn that? Well everyone learns from their childhood. Being taught consequences from a young age- and 14 really isn't that young- is incredibly important.", "> She\u2019s learning that her words have the power to make him not love her anymore.\n\nIs that a bad lesson to learn? She knows she has this power now and it's her choice whether she will use it to that effect or not. She's also learning that it's much easier to cause pain than it is to heal it - that two-second outburst has caused so much damage that it hasn't healed in days.", "He never said he didn\u2019t love her. He said if I was dead this is what would happen. He didn\u2019t block her number. He didn\u2019t do anything except send her to the other parents house, temporarily.\n\nActions have consequences.Wishing someone dead should absolutely have a consequence. And now she\u2019s learned it.", "Lol. Ok bud.\n\nShe's learned that being an asshole.. her own behavior..can drive people away. If she mistreats them..things she does.\n\nDad's love isn't unconditional forever. He's not a doormat.", "At what point is it wrong for a child to learn that love is typically conditional? You don't get to behave badly forever and still expect for everyone to unconditionally love you. Everyone has a line. And not even for love, but for continued help too. Plenty of parents still love their children who are addicts, but they can no longer help and support them. Plenty of parents still love their children who have committed violent crimes, but they can no longer help and support them. You can't just do whatever you want all the time and expect everyone to be okay with that forever. Seems like a good lesson to learn in a controlled environment with no risk or danger than to learn it later on when the stakes are much higher.", "Well that's not necessarily a bad lesson. You cannot talk and just say hurtful things to people regardless if they're your parents or not and expect for them to always be around. Parents are people too. And kids have the power to really hurt them. What she said was really hurtful. To wish your own parent dead because they're not letting you have your way? Or you're just angry?  Granted, I do think ignoring her is going a tad too far. Letting her know it'll be temporary would be good. But once she's home a good solid talk about the effects of words and how saying mean and hurtful things to people can push them away and to always be careful with what you say is a great way to end this lesson. Too many of you think that kids should never be punished or disciplined because they're kids and don't know any better or they only should get a stern talking to and thats it. Well they're not going to learn better unless there is a consequence to their actions or words. That is exactly how the real world works and it's the job of the parent to show them that. To prepare them for those things. And parents are also allowed boundaries. I don't care that they brought these people into the world. They do not have to put up with disrespect or hurtful comments just because it's their kids. This seems like an isolated incident and by no means am I expecting or telling OP to cut his daughter out his life. My statement is a general one. But saying hurtful things should result in a fair consequence. If he were to die this would be her life. And yes again, you say hurtful things to people they are well within their right to not want to deal with you anymore or even stop loving you depending on the relationship.", "Again, she can't say whatever she wants to people regardless of the nature of their relationship. That's not love. Love without boundaries is not love-- its a pathway to abuse. It is absolutely a good thing for him to teach her. If not, it teaches her that she can treat the people who care about her anyway that she wants and that they're supposed to stick around and take it.\nHe didn't dump her off on a street corner. He brought her to another custodial parent's home. It's also nt suuposed to be a permanent situation but long enough for both of them to have some space. This is a learning opportunity for both of them. OP and daughter should definitely have some discussion about why that wasn't OK and discuss both of their feelings .", "Just the same as young adults don't read material at their age level in the children's section; the same section with thick, cardboard-layered, durable books.", "Brother, wishing death on someone is not normal. That's completely valid to cut someone off over.", "They were already having a conversation about her behavior when she said this to him. I agree with the commenter who said he should tell her that she can come home when he gets an email that she apologized to her teacher, and then they can talk about her feelings. Sometimes people need to snap out of it, and it seems like this consequence was the proverbial Cher slap in the face.", "Well that's the point though, no? Maybe it could have been a good learning experience but he didn't just handle it poorly he handled in the one of the worst ways he could have. She lashed out and as a parent he shouldn't have respond in kind, he should've been able to show her why what she said was wrong without kicking her out and ghosting her.", "He sent her to her mums and isn't replying to her messages. He is literally ghosting his child. Its a completely inappropriate response from a parent.", "I'm reminded of the woman on the plane who doesn't want to sit next to a crying baby, and tells the flight attendant \"you may not have a job tomorrow.\" That's a manipulation tactic, and I'm guessing nobody's ever called her on it. Saying crappy things to people can bring about unpleasant consequences.", "I didn\u2019t say he said he didn\u2019t love her. I said that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to feel to her, as though he doesn\u2019t love her, because she\u2019s apologized and begged him to talk to her, and he\u2019s refused to even tell her if or when he\u2019s ever going to speak to her again.", "He also ignoring her texts, so he might as well of blocked his number. There's ways to teach her that her words have consequences, but sending her to live with someone who is cold and distant isn't it. He's teaching her that his love and support is conditional and if she slips up. He won't be there for her.", "This is not everyone. This is a child\u2019s primary caregiver.", "She has no idea whether her father has left her permanently or not, because he refuses to tell her.", "A child saying it is within the realm of normal for a teenager whether you agree or not. Do you think she literally has a personality disorder or something because of this one sentence she said?", "She has no idea whether she\u2019s ever going home.", "Agreed. In most cases, when a child isn't able to properly express their emotions, it's because the parents themselves are emotionally unavailable. I get the feeling that op may be there.", "Are you\u2026..a teenager?"]}
