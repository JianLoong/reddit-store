I really enjoy our chats, but the dynamic is becoming more and more frustrating.\n\nThis friend is always in control of every situation.\n\nFirst Issue: She will suggest where we go for dinner every week, and insist I must meet her outside her workplace. From my house, I then have to travel past the place we're meeting for an extra 10 minutes, just to meet her at her workplace, only to then walk back with her. When I suggest simply meeting at the place, she gets frustrated.\n\nWe also always meet in a location that is desirable for her; only once has she travelled 1hr to meet me where i'm based and i always have to travel to meet her.\n\nSecond Issue: She pushes in front of me in any queue. Whether it be the toilet, to order food, absolutely anything that involves one of us going first, she will push herself first. Last week we sat down for dinner and she got back up straight away and as she was walking away said 'shall i go first then?'. I was upset; sometimes i want to go first but it's a very awkward dynamic to discuss.\n\nLast Issue: We went to a gig last week. We had 20 mins to spare before it started, and on arrival they told us the toilets inside were out of order. I said I needed to nip outside to another restroom they recommended I use, and my friend reacted in an angry way and rolled her eyes at me. Then told me OK fine.\n\nI snapped and asked her if there is an issue with that. There clearly was. She was visibly irate but told me no it's fine she'll just have to wait there while i go as she has both of our tickets and had already pushed ahead and scanned us both in.\n\nI told her straight to simply go inside and I'll try and find her afterwards before the gig starts. Here is where I may be the asshole.\n\nI felt so furious that after I returned, I made no attempt to find her, and simply enjoyed the gig by myself. I turned my phone on airplane mode and enjoyed taking up space in that damn gig without anyone pushing infront of me. I had a great time.\n\nMy friend and I haven't spoken since.

Anyone who acts like going to the restroom is an issue should be left at a gig to figure it out herself. \n\nYou seem very frustrated with the dynamic. While she may be okay at times, that's not a good reciprocal friendship. Never put yourself second for someone else. You're NTA here in my opinion. Your friend seems self-indulgent and self-absorbed. Keep it moving.", "NTA and I think you know it's time to let this \"friendship\" go. She's not really your friend, friends don't walk all over you and have to be in full control every single second, dictating what you should do and when. They don't get angry when you have to use the restroom, especially at a place where the toilets are out of service.\r  \n\r  \nConsidering how much fun you had by yourself at the show, I think you know that the friendship has run its course. If I were you, I'd tell her exactly why and list out the examples, then block and move on. No need to waste more time and energy on someone so selfish and that clearly doesn't care about you, only herself.", "NTA she seems to treat you like her doll to control. Her friend that will do everything she wants.\n\nGood for you enjoying it on your own!", "NTA. OP drop her. she's clearly USING you. this woman is terrible.", "NTA. End this association. She isn't your friend. Anyone who wants to control everything and makes you go out of your way for them but won't do the same gor you is not your friend", "I think this is another one of those times where people let far too many things go, build up frustration and resentment, and then overreact. I think you were wrong for doing that at the gig so YTA for what you're asking, but you also should have stood up to her long before now. \n\nShe does not sound like a good friend. She sounds pushy, controlling and selfish, and you sound too passive and afraid of confrontation. This is a bad dynamic for friendship. \n\nYou were complicit in how she treated you. She may suggest where to go to dinner but you can say no. You can propose a rule that each of you gets to pick every other week. If she doesn't agree, you can stop going. \n\nShe can insist you meet her at work and you can say no. You should have told her how inconvenient that is and stopped doing it. If she refuses, you still could just wait at the restaurant and if she doesn't show, you can leave. \n\nIf she cuts in front of you, tell her to stop and get behind you. It's not awkward to defend yourself and expect respect from a \"dear friend.\"\n\nDo you want to maintain this friendship? Are there good parts of it? If so, you really have to set boundaries and stop letting her treat you this way.", "Why do you hang out with her?", "NTA\u2026.she is not a \u201cdear\u201d friend.  If you even talk to her again, stop letting her run all over you. Have plans for dinner?  I\u2019ll meet you there.  But I want you to meet me at work.  Sorry that won\u2019t work for me.  But, but\u2026 it is either we meet at restaurant or not at all.  Which is it?", "Nta, but honestly, how old are you guys? My friend group had a friend like this and we had to talk to her about it- like adults- when we were in our early 20s, she's chill now. Use your words", "YTA for abandoning your friend and ghosting her while out. I would say E S H cause her AH behavior is an ongoing problem but I just don't feel like her sucky behavior warrants what you did whatsoever. If you don't want to hang out with her cause she's a bad friend with a bad personality, don't hang out with her.", "NTA. Time to call your friend and set some boundaries or... let her go and practice setting better boundaries with new friends.", "ESH. She\u2019s selfish and inconsiderate, you\u2019re petty and passive aggressive, both of you can\u2019t communicate about the issues in a constructive way. Not a good fit as friends. \n\nAlso FYI, unless this is a regional quirk of language I\u2019m not aware of, you\u2019re not using the word \u201cgig\u201d right. For you it\u2019s a \u201cconcert\u201d or \u201cshow,\u201d for the musicians it\u2019s a \u201cgig.\u201d", "You're TA for abandoning her without communication, but I don't blame you for snapping after being treated like you're always the second to her first. I know from personal experience how hard it is to bring up issues you have with friends, but honestly, it's very much worth it for the health of the relationship and most of all you. \n\nI think it would be awesome for you if the friendship ended here, especially if you were never able to bring up these issues with her. Some people just don't mesh, and your friend's lack of servant-heartedness makes it very hard to mesh with her.", "They are not your friend.", "It wasn't a gig unless you were in the band and playing the music. Otherwise, it was a concert or a show.", "YTA, but just cause you acted like kid that doesn't like confrontation man up ( or woman up) and tell them to F off, or more kindle that you  don't like how they act", "ESH\nObviously her behavior makes her the AH\nAnd you- ditching someone at a concert whether you feel justified or not is ah behavior.  Do I think you should apologize- NO.  It\u2019s time for this \u201cfriendship\u201d to go.  \n\nYou let a lot of things go and allowed her to walk all over you.  Take this as a lesson learned and do not allow people to treat you this way.  It is ok to maintain your space - you don\u2019t have to make yourself small to make someone else feel good.", "YTA - You bring up all these other issues which have no relevance here. First and Second issue should have been discussed way before this, you're factoring them into your reaction, but guess what, waiting until issues are so bad that you blow up on somebody/do something like this does not absolve you of being an asshole. Last Issue was what matters. She did not do anything to deserve that treatment, you look insane for this. \n\nYou went somewhere with somebody, then left a woman at a show alone with no way to call her friend if something bad happened. That's a no-go for me. Bad behavior. \n\nLet me shift the viewpoint a bit on why this makes you an AH. My buddy and roommate has this tendency to not answer questions directed to him sometimes. \"Do you want me to get X for dinner?\" gets met with silence, I've been told \"that's your answer dude\", when it irks me to no end. If I was you, I wouldn't talk to him about it at all, then when he mentions I tied my knot wrong on my fly line I would tell him I'm going to go take a piss. But instead I hop back in my truck, and drive down to the next fishing access spot on the river. I didn't tell him this, and purposely made it so when he comes looking for me he thinks his ride has abandoned him at the river. Phones on airplane mode, hope he's there when I'm done fishing if he wants a ride home :\\^)\n\nDoes that sound like something a regular person does, or something an AH does? You're fighting a war with this woman and she doesn't even realize she's a participant, the conflict is one-sided, you're an asshole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
