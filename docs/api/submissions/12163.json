{"id": 12163, "submission_id": "11pt7g0", "title": "AITA for excluding my step son?", "selftext": "*Sorry for mistakes. Am on mobile*\n\nI have one step son \"Jerry\" (17M) and 4 kids. \"Mark\" is from a previous relationship and the younger 3 \"Jess\" \"Rick\" and \"Susan\" are with my husband. So Jerry has one step sibling Mark and 3 half siblings Jess, Rick and Susan.\n\nJerry's parents were never together (summer fling), and I met his dad when he was 8. His mom has been a very lovely co-parent and there has been no alienation from her side. Despite that Jerry has always been very resistant to our family.\n\nI suspect he was very possessive of his dad and viewed me as an intruder. Whereas his mom got married when he was 2 so he was used to her being married. \nTrouble is he never got around to changing his mind. He never accepted me or his siblings. This caused a lot of issues as my kids would beg me to make Jerry hang out with them.\n\nI always refused. I told them you can't force feelings and while we can do our best to invite Jerry we can't force him to join us and be a part of our family. Rejection is a part of life. This was very hard for them to understand, it led to a lot of self esteem issues for them.\n\nJerry was very vocal in his distain for our family, he always declared his friends his \"siblings\" and would rub it in the kids faces. It verged on bullying. I told Jerry that family was important but didn\u2019t force him to do anything. The kids got to a point where they stopped reaching out to him and just formed their own sibling group.\n\nThe issue is Jerry's \"chosen siblings\" have ditched him. I don't know why, I think they just grew apart. Now Jerry's on his own and has been reaching out to his siblings. They want nothing to do with him. Recently there was an event and the kids wanted to go so I bought them tickets. When Jerry found out he asked for a ticket and said he wanted to go too but the kids said no. I asked them if they would reconsider but they were firm. Jerry hurt them a lot and they're not open to him.\n\nI told Jerry that I couldn't force them to take him the same way I didn't force Jerry go take his siblings. I want for them to get along but I also don't want to go against their wishes.\n\nNow I'm getting hate for excluding him by Jerry and his grandparents. AITA? What do I do?\n\nEdit: Husband doesn't know what to do either. Also Jerry isn't excluded from the family. I always have and still always invite him to any family thing we do. He is simply choosing to attend now. The kids now that he will always be invited to family events. But this wasn't a family event. This was a hang out they wanted to do by themselves.\n\nEdit 2: Logging off. No useful advice and filled with people writing me off as the evil step mom to even read what I write. Fine, live your Cinderella moment. You're such hypocrites. If Jerry was here saying \"step mom is forcing me to hang out with stepsiblings\" you would be cursing my name.", "created_utc": 1678663085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pt7g0/aita_for_excluding_my_step_son/", "score": 336, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not excluding him. You're giving your kids the same choices you gave Jerry instead of trying to force a relationship", "Ehhh NTA, seems like you\u2019re trying to include him but his siblings are firmly not wanting him there\n\nSucks for Jerry as now he\u2019s facing the consequences of his actions", "NTA Jerry is old enough to understand consequences have actions. But sounds like some family therapy is desperately needed here.", ">and I met his dad when he was 8\n\nHaha at first glance I thought you were saying that your husband was 8 when you met him. lol\n\nNTA.  Normally, I'm very much against excluding step children, but you are basically doing now, the same thing you were doing before.  You didn't force Jerry to spend time with his siblings when he didn't want to, and now you are not forcing your other children to spend time with Jerry when they don't want to.  This is Jerry learning the consequences of his actions.  However, I think you should completely support them having any discussions that can maybe heal any past trauma, should your kids want to do that.", "Nta.\n\n You tired, and didn't force the relationship. ( Unlike so many others) \n\nJerry should have learned by now that his actions have  consequences even if it's years down the road...\n\nHe needs to plan something and ask the siblings to join it and see if they will come maybe if his other siblings see that he's willing to try to forge something now they might be more receptive to it. But he still has to understand he cannot force the relationship", "Jerry reaped what he sowed. He didn't want to be a part of the family, so he doesn't get to change his mind once he's alone with no one else. Has he even attempted to apologize? Tell his grandparents that if Jerry hadn't been so nasty all his life, then maybe his siblings would actually want to talk to him. NTA, OP. You are doing everything right.", "NTA. If he really seeks reconciliation, that is good and you and your kids should sit with him and talk it out. For this event it is maybe too recent and surprising for your kids, but maybe you can build new relationships in the future. Don't forget his age, he is also still learning and makes mistakes.", "NTA - youre not really excluding him, he excluded himself with his actions. Though I would try and encourage your kids to be more open to Jerry, but I cant blame them if theyre not.", "Hmm, can you refrain how you approach this so it's not a sibling/not sibling thing but more of an age/phase thing? In other words, can you talk about it with all your kids like \"Jerry struggled when he was a tween. Now that your tweens...\" instead of whether they accepted each other as siblings? Maybe it would help over time...\n\nNTA\nWhether your approach works or not parenting is hard and you didnt do anything assholish.", "If Jerry truly wants to be with them, he will just have to sit it out. They'll come around eventually, I would think. This may even be a reflection point for him. NTA", "NTA, not your fault all his mates jibbed him off. He\u2019s made his bed, time for him to lie in it. Good on you for teaching your children to respect people\u2019s decisions and not caving just for an easier life.", "NTA\n\nBut also, where is Jerry's dad in all of this?", "NTA - It is hard being a sibling in a blended family. I Jerry needs to show up more to build trust with his siblings. His dad or you should tell him straight up he was distant in the past, you understood and supported his boundaries, and you understand and support the other three children now. But he did hurt them. And feelings change, Jerry could help things along by showing up consistently, acknowledging he hurt them, and sticking around now.", "NTA. You can't force them to do anything but Jerry CAN start making amends. He needs to start with little things, build some trust with them and allow the relationship to develop at a pace they're comfortable with. How do they know that once Jerry gets a new set of friends he's not going to ditch them again and go back to treating them like interlopers? He needs to take ownership of his past actions and start showing them that he's changed. That will take time and effort on his part.", "NTA. You're right. You can't force a relationship between people. It has to happen on its own and its own time. \n\nBut I would like to point out one thing. If your kids do this on a regular basis, as in they ignore Jerry and any attempts he might make to reconcile or just outright refuse to let him do anything with them, then have a serious conversation with them. As in, tell them that holding grudges isn't good and that if they act that way, then they're being just as bad as Jerry was. All an attitude like that does is create bad blood.", "How old are your kids? You said Jerry was 8 when you met his dad and 17 now but you didn\u2019t say how old the rest of the kids are. I\u2019m assuming Mark is the only one within a decade of his age going on conservative math that you waited about a year and a half to get married and pregnant. \n\nSo by that math your oldest son is I\u2019ll say maybe the same age, but the rest of your kids are probably all under 10. I think that there is still time for Jerry to have a relationship with his half siblings but are those really the friends he\u2019s looking for???  \n\nI would sit down with your son and see if maybe you can talk him around to trying to be the bridge with his stepbrother. He doesn\u2019t have to obviously, but it would be super kind of him if he did.", "Sounds like a tough situation. You're right when saying that you cannot force relationships. So perhaps inviting Jerry and pretending everything is swell isn't the right idea. \n\nHowever, this could be the start of building the relationship they never had? Sit both sets of children down and explain what happened. Then build up the relationship by slowly spending time together and hopefully trusting each other. The sibling have known each other for a while, but have never really had a relationship. It takes time and trust to build that. It could be a good teaching moment for both parties. Jerry needs to learn that trust doesn't just happen overnight. The other children can learn empathy and understand the situation Jerry was in.", "NTA. I think you are being as fair as you can with them. Hopefully Jerry learns to be kinder out of this. I hope he understands why they feel this way.", "NTA", "NTA\nTry having a one on one conversation with Jerry about what happened with his friends. By supporting him in a time of need, you may be able to bridge the gap between you.", "NTA my favorite saying for situations like these I saw on another post \u201coh no, is that the consequences of my actions\u201d", "YTA for the edit now - you got some really great advice and even the yta/esh comments werent even that harsh. Let the sub do its job and theyll get downvoted. \n\nBut given how you handled the scant few negative comments here, I think there might be more to this story.", "NTA\n\nJerry brushed his siblings off for years, it's up to him to repair the relationship. Forcing his way in isn't the answer though, they will need to see he is putting in some sort of effort and that may be too little too late.", "Info: Where does your husband stand on all of this?", "How old are these kids? You only gave the age of the stepson and I'm thinking the oldest can't be more than nine, probably closer to 7. It just seems to me that you're kind of relishing this turn of events for Jerry and feel no need to have your kids spend time with him obviously in retaliation for him not wanting to spend time with these much younger kids when he was growing up! So .. INFO?", "ESH\n\nI'm going to disagree with some of the other responses. I think there are no winners in this scenario and you are not helping the situation by allowing your 3 (or 4?) bio children to be nasty and gang up on your one step-child and say \"eff you, we're all going to do stuff together, and we don't want you around.\" \n\nYes, I understand Jerry *when he was 8 years old*, was not in a place to be receptive to new stepsiblings. I think you also fouled up at that point, too, mom. Did you get therapy for Jerry to help him to cope with his situation? Or did you just throw up your hands in surrender, say one two three, not it!... And then be completely shocked when ten years later, you have a nasty household where kids only like each other based on who is related to whom by blood?\n\nI think you need to sit all three of your bio children down and have a talk about bullying and ganging up on people and exclusion. They've probably had this happen to them at school and this is what they are doing to Jerry now. It goes beyond just one child not wanting to spend time with another because when one child did it, there were always others to spend time with them. Now ALL your children are excluding the one stepchild and you seem to think it's fine because when Jerry did it as an 8 year old, you didn't shut it down (which I also think was a parenting mistake on your part.) That is a problem. Your entire family needs therapy more than they need concert tickets.", "Jerry\u2019s dad needs to have a talk with him. This is not your circus.", ">AITA?

YTA because you're argumentative and you didn't come here looking to hear what people thought, you just came here looking to be told you were wonderful and fair and perfect, but you're not. \n\nAn occasion that involves every single sibling in a family except one IS a family outing . . . a deeply exclusionary one. If you were really concerned, you wouldn't shrug your shoulders, you'd get the kids therapy. You'd also tell your kids, \"I'm really sorry that you're angry at your BROTHER, but we don't leave family members out of things. That is not a thing we do. You don't get to all go to stuff together and leave ONE sibling out. That's bullying; you didn't like it, so you don't get to do it.\" \n\nYou're not encouraging fairness, you're encouraging retaliation. YTA.", "YTA. Jerry was 8 when you married his dad. You and the other adults are responsible if he felt alienated from the family. If necessary, it should have been addressed in counseling years ago.\n\nYou only think about how the other kids were hurt by Jerry, and frame it all as him rejecting the family. You don't seem to acknowledge that him acting out that way meant that he felt like his dad was creating a new family that he wasn't fully part of, and you all let him go on feeling that way for years.\n\nYou seem to think that your options were to either force all the kids together or let them reject each other. But neither of those are good options.\n\nBasically, you blame the entire situation on Jerry even though he was a child. That's messed up.", "YTA. Jerry is still technically a kid at 17 yrs old. He's gone through the rough teen years and now something has clicked that he needs to make amends with his siblings. You are probably harboring some animosity towards Jerry for him not wanting to be apart of your family when he was younger. As the parent, you set the stage for acceptance or rejection. Jerry is trying to make an effort. You are acting like a kid. Even though your kids are remembering the rejection now, as they are around Jerry more, they might loosen their gripe about not wanting to be around him. You aren't teaching a life lesson about forgiveness. You're teaching your kids how to hold a grudge.", "You bought the tickets and excluded Jerry. Did your kids ask you to exclude him? If yes, then NTA. Jerry needs to try harder and gain their trust to be part of the group (No, he's not right. Tbh he's only 17 but he needs to learn from his mistakes).

Jerry was probably acting out of hurt or he wasn\u2019t ready to embrace a new family, which could be the case for the other kids as well  but they also may be being vindictive and petty, which you should absolutely put a stop to. This could also be a great opportunity to teach them a lesson about what you can gain from forgiveness and how grudges are worse for the person holding them than the object.

Let Jerry know you'll talk to his siblings, but you won't force them to include him just like you didn't force him to include him. Hopefully, he can understand their POV. Talk with your kids and ask them to reflect on how they felt when Jerry excluded them. Recognize it was hurtful for them and if they want to continue the cycle and do the same to Jerry or build the relationship.

If they pushed to actively exclude Jerry from holidays, whole family outings, family pictures, etc. that would be different. Especially given that the relationship between Jerry\u2019s two sets of parents is functional and healthy as far as we know, and they tried therapy and respected his boundaries/supported him.
