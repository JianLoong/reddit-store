This is with a complete stranger neither of us had met before. There is more background, but the short of it: he was making polite conversation during a business transaction with someone in town and for some reason suggested dinner (not expecting they would agree) and they did.

He asked.  The worst that could have happened--you saying no--did happen, but that's about it.", "NAH\n\nPersonally, I would have gone. Supporting your spouses business relationships is boring, for sure, but it can really give them (and by extension, your family) a leg up in their career. It can be a small act of love and support that helps your spouse. That\u2019s what makes good marriages good: small acts of love. That being said, with you still masking and already having plans, I don\u2019t think you are an AH for turning it down this time. I would make sure that given other opportunities to support your spouses career, you make it happen.", "NAH. Not a fun situation, but you're not an AH for wanting to stick to pre-made plans. Your husband wants comfort, but he's a big boy, he'll be able to handle his business dinner. It'll be alright.", "Where\u2019s the conflict?", "NAH You said the schedule wasn't set for a few months so your his didn't know you had plans. You have plans and can't go.\n\n>(As a side note I\u2019m recovering from COVID, and out of my isolation period but still at the tail end of my masking time). \n\nIf this is a reason not to go to dinner it's also a reason not to go to game night. Unless you intend to mask all night.", "NTA- I don\u2019t think he\u2019s one for asking either, tbh. He just asked and you politely declined so all seems fair.", "NAH the easiest thing would be for your husband to tell the dinner person \u201cOh shoot, I completely forgot the wife and I had plans already. Rain check?\u201d And then go with you to board game night.", "NTA You had plans with your friends so you weren't available. I hope your husband understands.", "NTA\n\nMy own hubby goes to business dinners once in a blue moon.  I'm never invited, thank goodness.  It is part and parcel of the job.  Your DH may be surprised and enjoy the dinner.  If not, he could possibly use you as an excuse to \"go and pick up the Missus\" for an early night.", "YTA. Just stay home from everything to remove any chance of spreading COVID and then messing up even more future game nights.", "NTA\n\nI mean your husband isn't either but the fact is, you aren't not going bc you ONLY don't feel like it - in which case, I would, as a good partner - but bc you actually do have plans. \n\nI'm sure it will all be fine, if he liked the person enough to extend the offer, they can't have been that bad.", "YTA. You can\u2019t do your husband a solid because you didn\u2019t want to disappoint friends you see regularly?", "YTAH, \nYour husband has to come first before your friends. You wouldn\u2019t want him to not rescue you from some mistake, so you have to rescue him. \nThe idea that you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want is foolish, you and your husband are one team one fight; sometimes you do what you don\u2019t want sometimes he does what he don\u2019t want. Once he asks you kinda gotta help your teammate", "Okay, I'm kind of split on this one. On the one hand, this is about your husband's career, and it could help his career with advancement.\n\nOn the other hand, he sprung this on you at the last minute. He shouldn't, but the reality is, that sometimes happens in your career advancement.\n\nFinally, I would say, since you made plans -- which, granted, aren't as important as your husband's career -- I'd say NTA if you don't go. And since you're still in your masking period (whatever that nonsense is), you have a ready-made excuse to bow out.", "Speaking as an introvert, that dinner sounds like one of the activities from an outer circle of Hell. NTA", "Your husband has every right to be upset at you for not helping him in an uncomfortable situation. That you feel guilt already basically means you know you made the wrong choice. \n\nThe question is what kind of relationship do you want to be a part of? One where you help each other out when you make small mistakes or one where you both are left to solve your mistakes alone.", "NTA, you aren't obligated to do whatever you don't want to do HOWEVER don't be a hypocrite about it either.\n\nIf you request/insist your husband do something with you, and he doesn't want to, then you have to respect that boundry as well. Don't draw some imaginary line and say \"well it was just with friends, this is different\" nonsense. Be consistent.\n\nIf you do hold him to obligations that he doesn't want to do, and you decide you don't want to do this for him, then that makes you a hypocrite and an asshole.", "NAH. I personally would have gone with him though", "NTA. You had plans and his invitation came after. Maybe next time if you have nothing else planned that day. Feel better.", "NTA. And hopefully, your husband will understand. It was also silly of him to make this dinner date with a total stranger in the first place.", "NTA and if your husband doesn\u2019t want to go he can use your Covid diagnosis as his his own.
