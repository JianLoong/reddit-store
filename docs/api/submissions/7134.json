Physical abuse is a no, but taking a gaming system away is imo a fair punishment for a non biological parent if the offense is valid. If he can never tell him anything he will eventually get fed up and say Jonah can\u2019t live under his roof, and that comes with an entirely different and more severe set of issues. If your husband is a good man, he has to be able to feel comfortable in his own home & a 17 year old who doesn\u2019t pay bills shouldn\u2019t run it. \n\nJonah would not be getting any party from me & Id be sending him to anger management classes instead.
