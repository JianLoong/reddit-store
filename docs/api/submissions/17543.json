Your sister should have asked if you would mind anyone else coming before confirming it, especially if there were gonna be more small children coming along.", "INFO: would your sleeping arrangements have changed?  Also, did sis say you were now responsible for additional children?

I hate when adults assume that it\u2019s okay to plan a trip and then sabotage a person into being a babysitter for the entire trip. \n\nIt\u2019s downright insulting and you should have no qualms about passing on an invite that not only changed, it morphed to include people you don\u2019t even know!", "Yeah that's what I thought.", "That's funny the way you said that. It changes the meaning of the word \"getaway\" altogether. Basically, it's the complete opposite! It would be a miserable time for OP with alternating periods of boredom and stress.

I developed moderate autoimmune arthritis in my 20s, and once that happened, I couldn\u2019t mind any child who needed to be physically stopped from doing things.  A struggle with them could do me injury, and worst case scenario might knock me over on top of the kid or result in the kid doing whatever I was trying to stop.\n\nMy older nephew was pretty gentle and easily managed from a young age, so I could watch him without trouble once he got out of his \u201cmust be held to the shoulder all the time or he screams\u201d baby stage.  My younger nephew is a much more rambunctious kid and pretty rough-and-tumble, and I never watched him alone because the risks didn\u2019t make sense.", "Maybe, but i decided not to go and just spend some time by myself or cancel the leave and get back to work"]}
