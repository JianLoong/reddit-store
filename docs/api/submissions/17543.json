It\u2019s not like the other parents will have their kids with them while your sister\u2019s kids stay with you, they will likely all want to be together, or the in laws will want the same deal.

You are not comfortable being baby sitter to three more kids that you have never met.\n\nAlso, I think you expected adult time with you sis and BIL.

Even excluding FIL, due to his health issues that that have been mentioned, there's 6 adults there.\n\nThey can easily share the child minding duties amongst themselves and still give each couple a chance for some time to themselves. If each couple took the kids in turn, all three couple could have 4 evenings (or even full days) child free.\n\nAbout the only thing that would be precluded would be all three couples going out for a dinner together. And frankly, unless there's some super special restaurant that they were planning to visit as a group, they could get that same group adults night out at home any time.\n\nIf she says anything more about you backing out, keep this in mind. Any claims the trip was \"ruined\" will likely either be overblown or evidence that they couldn't figure out how to coordinate amongst themselves.", "NTA.

With 5 adults present they should be able to look after their own kids.", "NTA, you guys had a plan you agreed to and she changed the plan, its definitely within your right to not agree with this new plan and stay home. Plus I would feel taken advantage of because they added more kids  without discussing it with you. If she does get very upset and start making you feel bad I would worry she just thought she was getting a free babysitter, but its normal for her to feel the stress of having to figure out what to do with her kids now and maybe shes disappointed she doesnt get to see you so I understand her feelings.

(when I think of cottage I think small living space)\n\n2) the expectation was you come without having to pay in exchange for some babysitting of your sisters littles.

IMO she has nothing to be mad about, she changed the arrangement without consulting you.", "NTA. That's not what you signed up for. \n\nPlus, with 4 extra adults in the house, she should have no trouble getting some short breaks from child care. So she isn't even losing anything. Not that it would be your fault either way.", "NTA at all for not wanting to go on your sister's couples holiday with her relations. \n\nIf she really wanted you there as a holiday for you as well she could have asked if you wanted to bring a friend, or something, and made clear that you wouldn't need to babysit the whole time.", "NTA\n\nYour sister told her husband's family you were coming to watch her kids for her and then SIL found out there would be a free nanny for the week and she likely decided you would watch her kids too so she could enjoy a vacation\n\nYou were 100% right to back out on the trip.\n\nYou were not going to get any free time.\n\nYou would have been stuck in a cabin, in the middle of nowhere...with 5 kids that you would be expected to entertain...all while everyone else goes on vacation\n\nI don't blame you one bit for bailing", "NTA.
