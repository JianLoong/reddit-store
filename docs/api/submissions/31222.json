Anyway, her house was absolutely spotless. \n\nAfter a while I went to the bathroom. Keep in mind others have been there before me and no one mentioned anything so it was a total surprise.\nI entered and immediately noped out of there. There was a black spider just chilli my above the window and another small one above her bathtub. \n\nI hate spiders so I went out and asked if any of the guys could kill those spiders as I couldn\u2019t use the bathroom.\n\nThe first to speak was Tamsin and she told me to use the other bathroom if I wanted but no one would be killi spiders.\n\nI asked her if she was serious and she said that yes. They don\u2019t bite, she doesn\u2019t kill spiders and doesn\u2019t have the heart to t tow them outside in winter so they\u2019re allowed to stay until summer, she didn\u2019t kind.\n\nI told her she was a freak and no one in their right mind keeps wild spiders roaming free in their house.\n\nShe said \u201csuit yourself, you can pee yourself for all I care but the spiders stay.\u201d\n\nI said she was rude and asked if no one cared. Everyone just shrugged their arms and some said \u201cit\u2019s just a small spider.\u201d\n\nI asked her again \u201care you seriously putting spiders above humans.\u201d\n\nShe looked me dead in the eyes and said \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nI asked her, \u201ccould you be any more of a freak.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replied and told me to get out of her house.\n\nI was fuming but I did leave. I met with my friends at another pub and they\u2019re split, some agree thag she\u2019s a freak and others agree but told me I was the asshole for saying it in front of everyone because it may cause problems at work.\n\nNow, it Saturday and I don\u2019t get to see Tamsin until Monday but I worry that I was the asshole and she\u2019ll report me or something.

They are often, as Tamsin said, harmless and do not even bite.\n\nLots of people (including myself) are uncomfortable with or even phobic of spiders. There was no harm in coming out and asking if they could be removed, but once you were told of how things are handled in the home and offered a choice of another, presumably spiderless bathroom, you crossed the line from \"reasonable misalignment of priorities/preferences\" to TA because you started calling her names and insulting her in her own home over that misalignment. It would have been reasonable to take her up on the offer of the other bathroom, to politely agree to disagree about spider habitat, or even to decide that you no longer wanted to be there and politely take your leave. But you didn't do any of those things. You took what you acknowledge had otherwise been a lovely and socialable night and turned it into an unpleasant encounter that likely soured everyone on the situation.\n\nYou don't have to agree with Tamsin. You don't even have to go back to her, apparently spotless but spider friendly home. But you really should apologize for the name calling and unkindness with which you ended your presence as her guest.", "YTA - this a \u201cyou\u201d problem. It\u2019s ok to be afraid of spiders but not everyone wants to kill them. Calling her a \u201cfreak\u201d was out of line for it. You have a phobia and need to work on it, that\u2019s not her problem.", "YTA. There's absolutely no reason to kill a non-venomous spider that's posing no risk to you. So you're scared of it. And? I'm scared of dogs. Guess how many dogs chilling in my vicinity, minding their own business, and posing no risk to me that I've killed? Do you really think you have a right to kill anything that frightens you? Your fear is your problem. \n\nYou had no right calling her a freak over your issues. You absolutely do need to apologize, and you'd best make it a good one.", "YTA. How can you think your behaviour was OK? I'm an arachnophobe & I wouldn't dream of telling someone what to do in their own home, or disrespecting their want to not kill spiders. Having a different outlook on things doesn't make her a \"freak\". Who the hell even calls people this? We're you the bully at school, picking on people who were different? How have you gotten to be 36yrs old and not have learnt how to respect other people? Your behaviour is that of a spoilt, bratty  teenager.", "YTA\n\nYou could have used the other bathroom. You could have sucked it up and confronted this fear. Or you could have wadded up some toilet paper and offed them yourself.**\\***\n\n\\*Stated on assumption you are **not** in Australia\n\nBut that's only the part of it. The bigger asshole part of it is how you went about expressing yourself. You immediately attacked and insulted this person for not following the One True Way of Life, aka, she doesn't see the world in the exact same way as your lordship.\n\nInstead of just using the other fucking bathroom, you had to put on a hostile show of self-importance.\n\n>  \n>  \n>I (f36) started working for a new company recently.

Not only did you call someone a \u201cfreak\u201d just because you don\u2019t agree with how they handle a harmless spider but you had to do it in their own home you were invited to as a new coworker and you were this disrespectful. If I were her that would be the last time you were ever invited to any social gathering with coworkers", "YTA.\n\nI used to live and work on a tall ship, and you were super lucky if a spider made its web by your bunk. Way less chance of being bothered by irritating insects and no risk at all to you. I got a particularly effective spider one season (we named her Charlotte) and I was the envy of every other sailor. They're not just harmless; they're beneficial.\n\nYou were offered another choice of bathroom, but instead you called your host a freak. Seriously, what's wrong with you?", "YTA big time. The spiders are helping trap other bugs, if they aren\u2019t poisonous or harmful what\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s also her house. We don\u2019t kill spiders or other bugs for that matter in our house.", "YTA. UK spiders aren't any danger to you. She even offered you another bathroom.

Talk about making a big deal over nothing.", "  \nI guess I'm a freak too because I don't kill spiders in my house either, my house my rules.

Not only do you have no right to disrespect someone\u2019s wishes in their own home, but you had the gaul to actually insult her to boot.

Her house, her rules.", "I have some spiders in my bathroom. It's an 1940's building. One likes to live in the corner of the shower. I let them be.

I would have done the same as Tamsin. \nHow rude of you to dictate what she can or can\u2019t do in her home.", "Sorry, YTA here. It's your coworker's house; if she is the type of person who doesn't believe in killing bugs, then you don't have the right to tell her she's a \"freak\" and that she's \"rude\". It's okay if you're afraid of spiders and are too afraid to use the bathroom because you saw a spider in there. Where you crossed the line was making a huge deal about it and calling her names. It's her house. She's your coworker. You made a scene. If she reports you, I think she'd be justified in doing so.", "You went too far. I don't like spiders or ninety nine percent of bugs, but I don't go around advocating for their eradication. You should have taken her offer to use the hopefully other spider free bathroom and stfu. You were beyond rude. Not liking spiders does not give you license to call her freak for her stance. Some people don't like killing..... anything. YTA.", "It's her house, not yours. You can't tell her what to do in her house.

Putting spiders above humans, jeeeez man!\nSpiders are really helpful in keeping away other bugs. I would not move it, either.", "Could you be any more YTA. You don't get to go into someone's house and tell them how to run it. You are an AH for calling them names and criticizing them for what they do in their own house. One in which you are a guest btw. She offered you another bathroom too, spiders were never prioritized over people. At this point you just sound like a bully and a spider terrorizer.", "YTA. And very rude to boot. I'm assuming you're an adult (but you know what they say about assuming) and should've kept your mouth shut and used the other bathroom.", "YTA and incredibly presumptious. I think they call it \"main character syndrome\" on the internet.\n\nHere's an alternate script that would have made you not the asshole.\n\nOP: I'm so sorry, but I'm deathly afraid of spiders. I don't think I'll be able to use the other bathroom because of my fear. I'll head over to the pub and meet you all there.

Start looking for another job because now all your colleagues have seen your true colors", "YTA this is hilarious. Even my arachnophobic partner loves Tamsin in this scenario. Like. Everyone has spiders in their home. Even if you don't notice them we all have spiders. I keep as many little guys as I can get away with based on mine and my partners level of tolerance (giant ones do get thrown outside unfortunately but my partner has improved hugely on how well she can handle smaller spiders and the spindly ones and I'm extremely proud of her).", "YTA. Get over yourself. Not your house, not your decision to make. Spiders are vital to the ecosystem and not everyone wants to kill them just because they find them \u201c icky\u201d.

I read the title of your submission and thought I'd be reading the post of a pubescent child. I'm pretty sure everyone is talking about your ineffective demands to alter a co-worker's living environment. First of all, if you're really an arachnophobe you would have been screaming bloody murder or just excused yourself from the party. You're old enough to have worked hard at spider desensitization to prevent a scene. But wait! You then label a co-worker who is also your host a pretty awful name and then going on to create a scene that leaves you now worried that your work environment will be challenged. \n\nHere's how it goes when you're a guest, especially at an event during which your behavior is on full display for those who can influence your future: stay in control, keep your mouth shut and carry on overcoming your fears. \n\nI  do get it. We all have something that we're challenged with but you lost control. You worked really hard to create a chasm between you and your work team. \n\nIn my opinion it's too late to worry about HR. Everyone who was there will be watching to see how you handle this. The best you can do is to sincerely apologize to the attendees for making a scene and promise to work on your own fears. If you've been reasonable and accommodating before this you can age out of this.

Please hear me out before you downvote. \n\nOP is the AH for her reaction to Tamsin regarding the spiders. This was not the time nor place for such discussions and the reaction was over the top. While I understand OP cannot handle spiders and was likely still working off some fear/nerves, her response to Tamsin was still rude, and as a guest, she shouldn't have insulted the host. Especially on her birthday. \n\nTHAT BEING SAID\n\nThe correct response Tamsin should have made when a guest expresses discomfort/fear over spiders is to calmly direct their guest to another bathroom, then REMOVE THE SPIDERS FROM THE MAIN BATHROOM AND PUT THEM OUTSIDE. That is how one is meant to respond when having a guest in their house. Especially one who is a work collogue who has an aversion to spiders. \n\nShe doesn't need to kill them. \n\nBut if you have ANY in A PLACE OF COMMON USE, you NEED TO REMOVE THEM WHEN YOU HAVE GUESTS OVER. \n\nThat's just common courtesy. \n\nAlso, I need to correct something that was written here. \n\n>They don\u2019t bite, \n\n**SPIDERS. DO. BITE.** \n\n**EVEN THE NONVENOMOUS ONES BITE.** \n\nAnd some people (like myself) have a severe allergic reaction to being bitten by spiders (swelling, rashes, itching sometimes hard to breathe). \n\nAnd more often than not, don't realize they're allergic until. They get. Bitten. \n\n**So by keeping spiders in a main common area like the bathroom, Tamsin could have unintentionally put one of her guests at risk of an allergic reaction.** \n\nHence my judgement of ESH.", "NTA but you cant get mad at the rules of her house tho.

But I know they\u2019re mostly harmless (I\u2019m not in Australia, so this is true here) so I leave them be unless they\u2019re coming right for me (rare) or I feel something and reflexively slap it. Most of the time I take them outside.\n\nYou\u2019re the AH here because of how you brought it up and refused to leave it alone after your friend gave you alternatives. You chose to be difficult (and rude) even though there were other options open to you.\n\nNow, if the bathroom had been crawling in baby spiders, that\u2019s different - just leave. But these were two small spiders, just chillin, and really didn\u2019t give a shit about you. Use the other bathroom or leave them be, but don\u2019t call someone else a freak for having a different perspective.", "I have a strong fear, borderline phobia, of spiders - I wouldn't have just walked out, I'd have *run* out, screaming or crying probably. just so you know I am not underestimating how awful spiders are.\n\nbut, it's her house. with my logical head I know she's right even - spiders keep other pests out, and they're also mostly cannibalistic and territorial, so if you can tolerate one or two you're likely to have fewer overall. you were offered a different loo that I assume did not have resident spiders in.\n\ncalling her a freak for having different spider tolerance than you was incredibly rude and uncalled for.\n\nYTA", "YTA", "Allowables\n\nBy: Nikki Giovanni\n\n\n\nI killed a spider\n\nNot a murderous brown recluse\n\nNor even a black widow\n\nAnd if the truth were told this\n\nWas only a small\n\nSort of papery spider\n\nWho should have run\n\nWhen I picked up the book\n\nBut she didn\u2019t\n\nAnd she scared me\n\nAnd I smashed her\n\nI don\u2019t think\n\nI\u2019m allowed\n\nTo kill something\n\nBecause I am\n\nFrightened\n\n\nYTA.", "Dang this is a tough one for me.. I feel like it was wrong to call your coworker a freak, but as someone with extreme arachnophobia I\u2019d be out of that house faster than the speed of light.", "YTA.  It depends on the spider of course but many spider species are actually helpful and easy to cohabitate with, especially in older wooden houses that can't entirely keep bugs out.  \n\nI do not blame your coworker for kicking you out and I definitely sympathize with her not being willing to kill harmless creatures for her own convenience.  Is it a little weird?  Yes but we've all seen worse and no one needs to be calling anyone a freak.\n\nI also understand your perspective too of course, spiders can definitely be scary if you aren't used to them, but the fact remains that you were in her space and if you didn't like what she did with the place you should just quietly excuse yourself.  No one else has a problem with this and that should be your first sign that you may be the issue.", "YTA. You insulted her in an incredibly rude way in her own home over a nothing issue. Get over yourself.", "YTA. i\u2019m not a fan of spiders, however, they kill flies, mosquitoes, and other annoying bugs i\u2019d rather not have inside. so, instead of killing them or setting the cats on them, i let them be", "YTA 100%  She can have spiders in her house if she wants. You're the one with the strange phobia. The spiders weren't bothering you.", "YTA it's spiders,not fucking roaches or rats. you would have been fine and calling her a freak was rude.", "YTA and a rude one at that.\n\nI\u2019d have been tempted to throw the spider at you frankly  after that outburst but the spider deserves better.", "YTA and just ruined any chance of having a good working environment \n\nSome people simply dont like killing. Your coworker sounds like a kind soul. You sound like a nasty one. Like who, outside of mean girl teenagers, calls other people freaks? I bet you were an asshole in high school too\n\n There was another bathroom. Get over yourself", "YTA I don\u2019t kill spiders in my house either. They\u2019re not bothering anybody.", "I'm a massive arachnophobic and I think YTA. Not your house, not your spiders. As long as they weren't perched on or above or on the path to the toilet, you could use it. Plenty of people let spiders live happily in their homes to kill flies and other insects. (I'm guessing these weren't venomous, obviously. That would be another matter.) And calling Tamsin a freak quite rightly got you kicked out of her house and will make work very uncomfortable. Your best hope is to apologise to Tamsin and explain that spiders turn you into a panicky fool.", "YTA. What you said to her calling her a freak what totally rude and out of line. So she doesn't want to kill spiders. She offered you an alternate site to pee, and you could have gone there instead of rudely insulting your host. You made yourself look bad in front of all of your coworkers.", "YTA. House spiders are harmless and help keep other bugs out. Plus they're cute and don't deserve death just because you think they're scary", "Yta\n\nI despice spiders, but know it is my stupid brain, that can't fandom more than 6 legs. Insects are okay. Arachnids? I freak out.\n\nBut when i have to pee I can ignore the itzy bitzy spider and don't throw a tantrum. There was also another bathroom to use!\n\n\nYou were a visitor in a co-workers house and made a scene. Everyone will think YOU a freak.", "Yta and really entitled.", "YTA. Piss in your own toilet in your own home if you cannot respect someone else's. You know she didn't have to let you use her bathroom right? She didn't even have to let you into her HOME and that's how you speak to her? Also, I don't know any 36 year olds still using freak as an insult, but it's rude as hell. You need to apologize and grow up. As old as you are, you should know better than to act that way. I personally would be through with you for being so ignorant and disrespectful. Also, the nerve of you to be fuming about the problem YOU caused\ud83d\ude02", "YTA - I dont think you feel bad about this but only really care so you can do work-related damage control and that's fucked up", "YTA\n\nYou should have just used the other bathroom.  You were spectacularly rude.", "YTA, your phobias are not your fault, but they are your responsibility.  \nI try and encourage spiders in my house, as they eats fleas, flies and mozzies, unfortunately my cat eats them .  \n\nSay I came over to yours, and you have a dog or cat, maybe I don\u2019t like dogs or cats, would you murder your pet for me, or massacre your neighbours because they were being a little louder than I like", "YTA.\n\nI had a daddy long legs that lived above my desk for quite a while, and some other kind of spider who lived in the bathroom. While certain spiders are dangerous, most aren't. They're handy at eating bugs I don't like, they construct interesting webs, and they can add a touch of atmosphere -- especially in a Victorian home!\n\nYou say the rest of her home was spotless. You say she said you could use the other bathroom. You escalated it by demanding she kill something she doesn't have a problem with, then you called her names. In her own house you did this.\n\nHopefully she's less entitled and petty than you are and won't report you to anyone. (Report to who and why for something that didn't happen at work I've no idea but you seem to be That Type Of Person who would do just that, so your projecting makes sense in a way.)", "YTA Regardless if it makes her a freak or not, you don\u2019t vocalize that someone is a freak in front of others or to their face, especially when it\u2019s someone you don\u2019t know well. That was beyond rude. \n\nIt was also rude to say she\u2019s putting spiders above humans. You had the choice to use the other bathroom. \n\nThat is absolutely a you problem. \n\nI understand some people are afraid of spiders, but if it\u2019s a teeny little harmless spider, her allowing it to stay isn\u2019t that weird. They eat the bugs in her house.", "YTA.\n\nI don't kill the bigs that come into my house either. I gently put them outside.\n\nYour fear of spiders isn't her problem. It's *yours*. You have no right to try to dictate how other people handle bugs in their house. You could have used the other bathroom. YOU made an issue out of it.\n\nI'd have chosen the spiders over you too.\n\nEDIT: I just read through a lot of the comments. Thank you, wonderful people of reddit, for caring for the spiders. It's heartwarming to see so many people understand how beneficial they are.", "So much YTA. If they\u2019re harmless and keeping away from you, it\u2019s fine. Also not your house, your opinion should be kept to yourself. \n\nBigger spiders freak me out, but if one wants to take up residence, not come near me, and keep the more irritating bugs out of my house, they are more than welcome to stay.", "Absolutely YTA here. As an adult, you should know name calling is never appropriate. I recommend you watch some Sesame Street if you need a refresher on the basics.", "YTA because she is allowed to be weird in her house.  She offered you another bathroom and you proceeded to act entitled.  Your coworkers may be talking about how weird it is for her to protect spiders but they are talking way more about your lack of respect and entitlement.", "YTA. Her house. It's not remotely weird, why chuck something out that's causing no harm?", "Oh, you were the asshole alright. Your manners are terrible, calling her a freak. YTA big style.", "YTA. I tolerate them mostly, they keep other bugs at bay and they don\u2019t do much harm.", "YTA. Your arachnophobia doesn't mean that everyone else has to bow to your irrational fears. In our house, too, we would never kill a harmless (and beneficial) spider just for hanging out. We set them outside in the summer, and if I found one in the winter that was large I'd probably take it to the barn. But not everyone has that luxury.\n\nAsking your host or anyone really to kill a spider just because you feel murderous is ludicrous. You had another bathroom to use.", "We keep our front door open when it\u2019s nice out so often have a fly or two buzzing around. For about 10 mins, until it goes into the windowsill where our spidey friend catches them. It\u2019s not poisonous, it\u2019s always behind the shade, it can stay.", "Yep I agree. I am also a person who will let spiders live in the house. They take care of other pests and remain hidden most of the time. Some people don\u2019t like needlessly killing creatures while other people don\u2019t think it\u2019s that deep. Either way, it was her house and you really didn\u2019t need to escalate it the way you did. Especially considering you could have just used the other bathroom.", "Agreed !!!", "Completely agree, like I\u2019m one step away from a phobia of spiders and I would\u2019ve had to leave because I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with the house filled with spiders but it\u2019s my issue. I think it\u2019s awesome that people are comfortable enough with them in their house but I I can\u2019t sleep well or be relaxing in the house with spiders and it\u2019s my issue not anybody else\u2019s.", "Agreed. OP, YTA. For the record, I don't kill spiders in my house either. We have an understanding. It's not uncommon.\n\nAlso asking the GUYS to kill them? Internalized misogyny much?", "Fear, entitlement, and being an uncouth judgemental A\\* is OP's problem.

I'm happy to be a freak as a result.", "I'm terrified of spiders but try to respect their place in the world. I had three big web guys set up on my building and I named them Harry Larry and Joe.

It does sound like you have a strong phobia like him and he did like a reverse aversion therapy. It really helped him.
