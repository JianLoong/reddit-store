But she can have ridiculous boundary issues, especially concerning the bathroom. She hates anyone being in the bathroom with her. Sounds reasonable, right?  Except she'll rage angrily if anyone gets near her in the bathroom. Just now, our 3 year old son, hyper as normal, starts to open the bathroom door when she is in there. This happens just as I am walking upstairs from my basement office to get some food. I hear her shriek \"Don't open it!!!\" at him, in a voice that's both panicky and angry, and he is startled and starts crying \"Sorry!! Sorry!!!\" and he is obviously upset that his mother just freaked out on him. I'm annoyed because if she really wants privacy, then lock the damn door. But she rarely does. Sometime she leaves it open a crack, and without the light even on so I wouldn't even know someone is in there, and when I start to walk by (not even knowing she's in there) she'll shriek out to not come in the bathroom. Like OK I wasn't going to, but close the damn door if your privacy is that important. That's actually happened so many times, where she is in there, the door is open a crack, and the light is OFF, so I think it's unoccupied, and she freaks out on me when I start to go in.\n\nAbout a week ago. I walked into our master bedroom which has a private bathroom with two french doors. Both just open. I start to walk into the bathroom not knowing she's there, and she shrieks out \"Ahh don't come in here!!\" which startles the hell out of me. And she comes out mad at ME. Again... close. The. Door. If. You. Need. To.\n\nJust now when the incident with my son happened (and he was crying and I was trying to console him, angry that such a stupid thing made her react so much as to upset him), I mumbled under my breath \"Yeah because the world would end if someone saw you in the bathroom\" and I left the room. She texted me \"I don't want to hear one more goddamn smart comment about me needing privacy in the bathroom\". \n\nIt's not that I don't think she deserves to have privacy, it's that I am frustrated that a) she doesn't take the proper precautions to ensure it, and b) blames the other person and gets mad at them (me), or screams and makes a kid CRY, because they (heaven forbid) almost saw her sitting on the toilet.\n\nReddit - AITA or does she need to chill out?", "created_utc": 1684441067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l9mc8/aita_for_getting_frustrated_with_my_wifes/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
