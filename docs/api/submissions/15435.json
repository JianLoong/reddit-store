You bought the shirt, I\u2019m assuming she \u201ctrespassed\u201d your room, and then she threw away a newly purchased shirt \ud83d\ude42. It\u2019s your \u201cprivate property.\u201d", "NTA - as others have stated, she's cherrypicking.", "NTA, I think you should throw out her Bible, she's obviously not using it and doesn't need it anymore.", "NTA. My mother ripped down my GnR and Aerosmith posters when I was a teen. She found a GnR shirt I'd bought and hidden and threw it away in a screaming fit. She was also Christian.  It's funny now, esp the memory of explaining that GnR was a Christian Rock band, proof of which was Axl's skull cross tattoo.\n\nBut it was scary, hurtful and devastating back then. It did not enhance our tenuous relationship. I'm sorry that happened to you.", "She had no right to steal your property and throw it away, and lied about it -- she is a massive hypocrite. If that were me I'd start wearing t-shirts with Baphomet, and outright satanic and occult images on just to piss her off until she learns to treat you like an adult with more rights than her fairy tales. NTA", "If your faith is threatened by a picture on a t-shirt, your faith is silly, and not a true search to live in imitation of Jesus Christ.", "It was venom lol, and also im actually considering getting THAT cradle of filth shirt as one commenter here suggested. probably after i move out tho", "JIAC! added to cart!", "Not to be pedantic, but it's \"thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\"", "It doesn\u2019t matter how you or others see it.  The homeowner doesn\u2019t like it.", "The tone of the post makes me think this was an expensive-ish piece of merch that they treated themselves to so they probably can\u2019t just *buy a replacement*. I had to save for band merch at that age, or at least make sensible decisions about my spending before splashing out on a specific top that costs more than your average piece of clothing so there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be able to replace something like that instantly/easily. OP also shouldn\u2019t have to pay for a new one.\n\nI\u2019m sure that if OP was able to retrieve the top they would have but as they haven\u2019t said they\u2019ve done that, I\u2019m guessing they couldn\u2019t because the rubbish had been collected or something.", "You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions:\n\n1.  There is nothing in the post to suggest that the shirt was expensive.  OP makes no reference to having saved up for the item or how he had been wanting it for a long time.  He just said that he bought a shirt. You then proceed to go off on a tangent about your own experiences as a teenager. \n\n2.   There\u2019s nothing to suggest that he was unable to retrieve the shirt. There is likely only a 1/7 chance that his mom discarded the shirt the same day as trash collection. He may very well have the shirt and was just upset about the fact that it was thrown out. \n\nAs an aside; I think it\u2019s interesting that he spent TWO HOURS looking for the shirt before asking his mom about it.  How big is their house?  How many reasonable places are there outside of his bedroom and the laundry bin?", "Only in your imagination.  I explicitly stated that I wasn\u2019t defending the mother and then I made a factual statement that OP has to respect her rules."]}
