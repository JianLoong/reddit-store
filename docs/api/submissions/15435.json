She stole your shirt. Kinda cherrypicking those Christian beliefs eh?", "NTA - How Christian of her to steal your shirt... Is there not a commandment about that?", "NTA. You're 20, you bought it with your own money. She shouldn't have done that.", "NTA.\n\nAt 20, you're an adult. You bought the shirt. Your mother had no right to steal it. She should reimburse you for it.\n\nThat said, if you're living at home, she does have the right to tell you not to wear something she finds offensive.", "NTA. \n\nIt was wrong of her to throw away your personal belongings. She could have approached you and had a conversation about it. Maybe y\u2019all could have agreed that you wouldn\u2019t wear it around her if it made her uncomfortable. But her chucking in the trash was out of line.", "NTA.  But it\u2019s probably time to move out or respect her rules. Don\u2019t wear the shirt in the home. Wear a different shirt and then change once you leave the house. And then change back when you come home or make sure she is asleep. She does have the right to enforce a certain level of dress code since you are an adult living in her home.  But to clarify:  she had no right to throw your shirt away.", "NTA. You bought that shirt with your own money. The least she could've done, is ask you about it, or confront, if she's that upset by it.\n\nThe fact that she denied it at first, might suggest that you found out faster about it than she might have expected, and perhaps feels ashamed about it.\n\nYea, maybe you could have done with less anger, but your mom didn't do this the right way either", "NTA. But you know as well as I do that these two worlds have never mixed well. Probably time to move out \ud83d\ude02 \ud83e\udd1f", "I mean NTA because she should have handled the situation better.\n\nCould have put the shirt outside and let you decide what to do with it. Throwing it away is pretty uncalled for. \n\nBut, you know, you're 20. Move out of mommy's house and you won't have these problems.", "NTA. Regardless of the difference in beliefs, living in that house doesn\u2019t give your mother the right to steal your things.\n\nExpecting that you don\u2019t wear it visibly in the house, and requesting that you not do so elsewhere would be reasonable, even if a bit overbearing.", "NTA. At 20 years old, you'll probably get to move out soon and live your own life free from her judgment. Enjoy that when it happens!", "NTA she just went against her own religion by stealing from you, tell her thou shalt not steal", "NTA. She had no business touching your clothes. \n\nAlso remind your mother that the upside down cross is from Saint Peter who was crucified upside down because he didn't believe he was worthy to die in the same fashion as Christ. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "NTA. I would have been fucking livid!", "Nope NTA, you're 20 and can pick out your own clothes. Your mother had no right to throw out your property. That's stealing, and I think there's a commandment about that.", "NTA, and it was so Christian of her to lie about it.", "ESH\n\nYou for throwing a fit when you are  presumably living in her house rent free. Her house, her rules. I know living with a controlling parent isn\u2019t fun, but throwing a fit like that can just make an unreasonable parent more unreasonable. 3 or 4 more arguments later, she might start asking you for rent, or tell you should be doing 100% of the chores as compensation for her raising you. The solution is to move out. If anything, this is a sign to not make any more nonessential purchases while you\u2019re still living there and focus on getting a place of your own.\n\n\nYour mom because she could\u2019ve handled the situation better too, and at least had a conversation with you about the shirt before taking action. She should\u2019ve used her words, rather than making a unilateral decision to throw it out. And assuming you bought the shirt with your own money, I\u2019d say she should ideally pay you back for the amount you spent on it.", "Why are you still living at home.", "NTA. \n\nJust tell her it was the cross of St. Peter. You weren\u2019t being anti-Jesus! You were being extra pro-Jesus!", "So the upside down cross is actually peters inverted cross, \"thou shalt nought steal\", \"thou shalt not bear false witnesses against thy neighbor \", \"honour thy father and mother\" yea your mither broke many of the commandments with this little stunt. I'd say print them all out and hand them to her, see how really Christian she actually is", "If you're living with your mom in her house, her house, her rules.  If you are not living in her house, then not her rules.  \n\nThis feels a bit ESH if you're still at home.  If not NTA.  \n\nHer tossing it without comment is an AH move for sure though.
