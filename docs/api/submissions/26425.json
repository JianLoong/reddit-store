She told me that we didn\u2019t have the money for a deposit on a mortgage, but I personally have a lot of money in savings. It\u2019s a little bit more than $160,000. \n\nMy girlfriend was initially just shocked because it is a lot of money for a 24 year old to have saved (I\u2019ve been extremely lucky in life). After a couple of days she began to be annoyed at me. She felt like I was hiding this from her. \n\nI told her that I didn\u2019t hide it from her, I was just raised to not talk about personal finances with anyone other than someone you\u2019re married to, and I figured engaged is close enough that I\u2019m happy to talk about it. I also said that I had actually used these saving to help her before (I\u2019ve paid her rent a few times when she couldn\u2019t and paid a couple thousand dollars for her dog to get surgery). She was still quite angry and has been giving me the silent treatment for the past day. \n\nMy parents don\u2019t see the problem (duh), her parents understand my perspective but think I should have told her when we moved in together last year. None of our friends know because I don\u2019t feel comfortable talking about it with them. \n\nI\u2019ve already asked her if we can talk about it when she\u2019s ready and she just said she\u2019d let me know when she was. I don\u2019t think this is relationship ending, but I know she probably wants me to admit I was wrong. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything wrong.

You pay your way with your earnings, not your savings.\n\nKnowing about your savings should not change any part of her life at all. So, why is she mad? What difference does it make? If anything, this is a happy surprise. \n\nHad you been drowning in secret debt, she would have reason to be annoyed. \n\nAs it is, though? What\u2019s her problem?", "nta...and for the love of fucking god, do not marry her without a prenuptial agreement.  Don't say you haven't been warned.", "Definitely a better surprise than discovering your husband/fianc\u00e9 has thousands of dollars in unpaid debts that are now becoming yours as well \n\nNTA \n\nAt some point you need to do the \"financial discussion\". That point, in my opinion, is when you decide on marriage... which means when you get engaged. Prior to that, it is just not needed and it can be argued that may pollute the relationship. \n\nYou do need to know the economic habits of your partner... but knowing that he can help you with rent with little or no notice, that he is never scrambling to pay bills, should give you a good idea that he has his finances in order. The magnitude of his savings is irrelevant until marriage enters the picture... And that is where significant differences in wealth or in financial discipline should lead to a pre-nup.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't married yet, so your money is your business.  It would be understandable to have a discussion about both of your financial situations by this point in your relationship, but she didn't raise this topic either.\n\nHer reaction feels a little too much... As if she would have wanted you to give her financial support or something if she had known you had so much.  This is definitely a red flag.\n\nI recommend that you don't buy a house together until married, and that the two of you both contribute to the down payment and mortgage payments.", "NTA $ is on a need to know basis.

Get a new fiance. This one is not ready to be an adult.", "NTA - you pay most of the rent/bills, so you didn't take poor to make her cover you. You told her; you didn't get caught and confessed. You waited until a reasonable point in the relationship to disclose private, financial info. I think you're perfectly reasonable.\n\n\n\nHow she deals with this conflict tells you a lot about your future together. It's one thing to take a little time to process a surprise or a different expectation, but it's another to blame you for it. Talk it through, but be careful of the habit that will likely continue on conflicting situations", "I am not sure why she had this reaction. NTA.

Your finances are your business alone. Once engaged, financial conversations need to happen as you hash out how you want to handle money together. It's your money, not hers. She should be impressed, not upset, unless it changes her expectations of what you can afford FOR HER. That could be a problem going forward. If your ring isn't as expensive as she now wants it to be out she's mad you aren't buying her expensive things and vacations, you need to have conversations about finances quickly. Finances are a huge source of arguments between couples. Hash this out sooner than later. If it's not going to work out, figure it out before you get married.", "NTA, giving you the silent treatment because of it is clearly an overreaction.

She is acting completely immature about this.  And maybe show her the responses to your post to give her a wake-up call.", "NTA\n\nShe's... giving you the \"silent treatment\"? \n\nThat's not great, my man. \n\nThat's something children do to one another. Not adults who are looking to enter into an equal partnership.\n\nAnd no, you didn't do anything wrong. This is the time where couples lay their finances on the table. \n\nI'd... probably put a pause on the wedding plans for the short term. At least until she grows up. It's not relationship ending territory, IMO, unless this escalates. But her reaction is Not Great either.", "Look if my partner of 4 years told me he had enough money for a deposit, I would ask to sit down and figure out how I can put as much in or do something to the same value. \n\nWould I be angry? It would depend, if we were struggling beforehand, probably. \n\nBut if we were able to pay our bills and stuff and he could still save that?. Probably wouldn\u2019t phase me", "However you handle this - remember that you\u2019re setting the template for how all future disagreements will be solved.\n\nDon\u2019t admit you\u2019re wrong just to get past the awkwardness, but also don\u2019t be aggressive in your refusal to apologize \n\nBe clear on how long you\u2019ll tolerate the silent treatment \n\nBe kind but have firm standards for how you expect to be treated and treat her the same as you would like to be treated.\n\nNTA", "INFO - do you communicate about your life together? Long before we got engaged we talked timelines about wedding, kids, house etc and what our budgets were to accommodate those and also to be able to travel before any of that. It seems odd to me you wouldn't communicate about those things before getting engaged which would have naturally brought up the savings? Also I feel holding out on such a big piece of information that would finance part of your life together is not something you hold out on until marriage. To me it shows a lack of trust to share knowledge with her and communicate. The value of the money is irrelevant - it would be the same thought process as if you were in debt and not telling her until you were married.", "NTA\n\nMan, if it were me, I'd be so impressed you managed to save up all that money. You initiated the conversation and told her after you got engaged because you felt it was an appropriate time to do so, which I find understandable.\n\nYou didn't hide a debt from her. This is a good sort of surprise. And you've only been dating for two years.\n\nYou've been paying for 3/4th's of the rent based on income, and everything else is split 50/50. That's extremely fair. The thing I'd be most concerned about when it comes to finances, when it comes to a relationship, is the capability of the other person to be my teammate in paying the bills. To know they're responsible with money so I can rely on them to do their part.\n\nI have 60k saved up for a house, and I'd probably wait\\* till engagement, or talks of engagement to mention it.

I wonder if she is hiding any debt that she may want you to pay off\u2026", "NAH. I get your point but when you start cohabitating and combining lives, that\u2019s a big step towards a serious future together. When my ex and I lived together, we split expenses by income and savings to have the lifestyle we wanted but we were also budget conscious. My guess? Your fianc\u00e9e feels like either you weren\u2019t splitting things equally OR, she spent time feeling guilty when you helped her out, thinking she was more of a burden on your finances than she was.", "Sharing your life with someone happens in steps. Friends/dating, eventual cohabitation,  talks of marriage, which at that point, when you become engaged, then you talk about personal finances. Before a certain level of personal, intimate knowledge of each other is reached, which includes a certain level of trust, your savings was none of her business. Until you reach that level, which only happens with time, for all you know this person could be a gold digger or scam artist or just nit your forever partner. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nImagine being upset that the love of your life has the financial ability to get you set up with a house and has bailed you out financially more than once. \n\nThe silent treatment is really the nail in the coffin for me.", "NAH on the assumption you both will have a productive conversation. You did not owe her an explanation or this information; told her timely. Her perspective has been rocked and it\u2019s going to take some people time to adjust. If that conversation goes south, then you\u2019ll learn (before marriage) a sad truth that you\u2019re not on the same page on financial issues. You\u2019re in the process. Good luck!", "NTA, if you didn't have a conversation about finances before, then you didn't have it.

Nothing wrong with having a lot of savings. I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to share that info. Same with me and my husband we didnt disclose how much we had until closer to the wedding when we were deciding on a prenup or not.", "NTA. Her whole reaction is a red flag.

Because regardless of how you were raised, you made a conscious decision to not share it with her during any past discussions about the financial realities of cohabitating, the future you guys want to build together, etc. I think you need to take accountability for that, apologize, and ask what she needs from you to be able to move forward and feel like you trust her again.", "NTA", "NTA.
