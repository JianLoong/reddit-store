She told me that we didn\u2019t have the money for a deposit on a mortgage, but I personally have a lot of money in savings. It\u2019s a little bit more than $160,000. \n\nMy girlfriend was initially just shocked because it is a lot of money for a 24 year old to have saved (I\u2019ve been extremely lucky in life). After a couple of days she began to be annoyed at me. She felt like I was hiding this from her. \n\nI told her that I didn\u2019t hide it from her, I was just raised to not talk about personal finances with anyone other than someone you\u2019re married to, and I figured engaged is close enough that I\u2019m happy to talk about it. I also said that I had actually used these saving to help her before (I\u2019ve paid her rent a few times when she couldn\u2019t and paid a couple thousand dollars for her dog to get surgery). She was still quite angry and has been giving me the silent treatment for the past day. \n\nMy parents don\u2019t see the problem (duh), her parents understand my perspective but think I should have told her when we moved in together last year. None of our friends know because I don\u2019t feel comfortable talking about it with them. \n\nI\u2019ve already asked her if we can talk about it when she\u2019s ready and she just said she\u2019d let me know when she was. I don\u2019t think this is relationship ending, but I know she probably wants me to admit I was wrong. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything wrong.

You pay your way with your earnings, not your savings.\n\nKnowing about your savings should not change any part of her life at all. So, why is she mad? What difference does it make? If anything, this is a happy surprise. \n\nHad you been drowning in secret debt, she would have reason to be annoyed. \n\nAs it is, though? What\u2019s her problem?", "nta...and for the love of fucking god, do not marry her without a prenuptial agreement.  Don't say you haven't been warned.", "Definitely a better surprise than discovering your husband/fianc\u00e9 has thousands of dollars in unpaid debts that are now becoming yours as well \n\nNTA \n\nAt some point you need to do the \"financial discussion\". That point, in my opinion, is when you decide on marriage... which means when you get engaged. Prior to that, it is just not needed and it can be argued that may pollute the relationship. \n\nYou do need to know the economic habits of your partner... but knowing that he can help you with rent with little or no notice, that he is never scrambling to pay bills, should give you a good idea that he has his finances in order. The magnitude of his savings is irrelevant until marriage enters the picture... And that is where significant differences in wealth or in financial discipline should lead to a pre-nup.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't married yet, so your money is your business.  It would be understandable to have a discussion about both of your financial situations by this point in your relationship, but she didn't raise this topic either.\n\nHer reaction feels a little too much... As if she would have wanted you to give her financial support or something if she had known you had so much.  This is definitely a red flag.\n\nI recommend that you don't buy a house together until married, and that the two of you both contribute to the down payment and mortgage payments.", "NTA $ is on a need to know basis.

Get a new fiance. This one is not ready to be an adult.", "NTA - you pay most of the rent/bills, so you didn't take poor to make her cover you. You told her; you didn't get caught and confessed. You waited until a reasonable point in the relationship to disclose private, financial info. I think you're perfectly reasonable.\n\n\n\nHow she deals with this conflict tells you a lot about your future together. It's one thing to take a little time to process a surprise or a different expectation, but it's another to blame you for it. Talk it through, but be careful of the habit that will likely continue on conflicting situations", "I am not sure why she had this reaction. NTA.

Your finances are your business alone. Once engaged, financial conversations need to happen as you hash out how you want to handle money together. It's your money, not hers. She should be impressed, not upset, unless it changes her expectations of what you can afford FOR HER. That could be a problem going forward. If your ring isn't as expensive as she now wants it to be out she's mad you aren't buying her expensive things and vacations, you need to have conversations about finances quickly. Finances are a huge source of arguments between couples. Hash this out sooner than later. If it's not going to work out, figure it out before you get married.", "NTA, giving you the silent treatment because of it is clearly an overreaction.

She is acting completely immature about this.  And maybe show her the responses to your post to give her a wake-up call.", "NTA\n\nShe's... giving you the \"silent treatment\"? \n\nThat's not great, my man. \n\nThat's something children do to one another. Not adults who are looking to enter into an equal partnership.\n\nAnd no, you didn't do anything wrong. This is the time where couples lay their finances on the table. \n\nI'd... probably put a pause on the wedding plans for the short term. At least until she grows up. It's not relationship ending territory, IMO, unless this escalates. But her reaction is Not Great either.", "Look if my partner of 4 years told me he had enough money for a deposit, I would ask to sit down and figure out how I can put as much in or do something to the same value. \n\nWould I be angry? It would depend, if we were struggling beforehand, probably. \n\nBut if we were able to pay our bills and stuff and he could still save that?. Probably wouldn\u2019t phase me", "However you handle this - remember that you\u2019re setting the template for how all future disagreements will be solved.\n\nDon\u2019t admit you\u2019re wrong just to get past the awkwardness, but also don\u2019t be aggressive in your refusal to apologize \n\nBe clear on how long you\u2019ll tolerate the silent treatment \n\nBe kind but have firm standards for how you expect to be treated and treat her the same as you would like to be treated.\n\nNTA", "INFO - do you communicate about your life together? Long before we got engaged we talked timelines about wedding, kids, house etc and what our budgets were to accommodate those and also to be able to travel before any of that. It seems odd to me you wouldn't communicate about those things before getting engaged which would have naturally brought up the savings? Also I feel holding out on such a big piece of information that would finance part of your life together is not something you hold out on until marriage. To me it shows a lack of trust to share knowledge with her and communicate. The value of the money is irrelevant - it would be the same thought process as if you were in debt and not telling her until you were married.", "NTA\n\nMan, if it were me, I'd be so impressed you managed to save up all that money. You initiated the conversation and told her after you got engaged because you felt it was an appropriate time to do so, which I find understandable.\n\nYou didn't hide a debt from her. This is a good sort of surprise. And you've only been dating for two years.\n\nYou've been paying for 3/4th's of the rent based on income, and everything else is split 50/50. That's extremely fair. The thing I'd be most concerned about when it comes to finances, when it comes to a relationship, is the capability of the other person to be my teammate in paying the bills. To know they're responsible with money so I can rely on them to do their part.\n\nI have 60k saved up for a house, and I'd probably wait\\* till engagement, or talks of engagement to mention it.

I wonder if she is hiding any debt that she may want you to pay off\u2026", "NAH. I get your point but when you start cohabitating and combining lives, that\u2019s a big step towards a serious future together. When my ex and I lived together, we split expenses by income and savings to have the lifestyle we wanted but we were also budget conscious. My guess? Your fianc\u00e9e feels like either you weren\u2019t splitting things equally OR, she spent time feeling guilty when you helped her out, thinking she was more of a burden on your finances than she was.", "Sharing your life with someone happens in steps. Friends/dating, eventual cohabitation,  talks of marriage, which at that point, when you become engaged, then you talk about personal finances. Before a certain level of personal, intimate knowledge of each other is reached, which includes a certain level of trust, your savings was none of her business. Until you reach that level, which only happens with time, for all you know this person could be a gold digger or scam artist or just nit your forever partner. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nImagine being upset that the love of your life has the financial ability to get you set up with a house and has bailed you out financially more than once. \n\nThe silent treatment is really the nail in the coffin for me.", "NAH on the assumption you both will have a productive conversation. You did not owe her an explanation or this information; told her timely. Her perspective has been rocked and it\u2019s going to take some people time to adjust. If that conversation goes south, then you\u2019ll learn (before marriage) a sad truth that you\u2019re not on the same page on financial issues. You\u2019re in the process. Good luck!", "NTA, if you didn't have a conversation about finances before, then you didn't have it.

Nothing wrong with having a lot of savings. I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to share that info. Same with me and my husband we didnt disclose how much we had until closer to the wedding when we were deciding on a prenup or not.", "NTA. Her whole reaction is a red flag.

Because regardless of how you were raised, you made a conscious decision to not share it with her during any past discussions about the financial realities of cohabitating, the future you guys want to build together, etc. I think you need to take accountability for that, apologize, and ask what she needs from you to be able to move forward and feel like you trust her again.", "NTA", "NTA.

I don't think that you keeping your savings a secret  is a problem, but I can imagine being a bit hurt when finding out only now.  I am not saying it's rational, but well, emotions aren't. \n\nI'm not saying that this is what she's thinking, but I'm hoping that other people's comments aren't making you believe that she has ill intent and wishes she could've used your money. Just wait for her to be ready to talk.\n\nEdit: I had typed \"keeping your savings\" but meant \"keeping your savings a secret\"", "I mean obviously your not in the wrong. In saying that, i guess I might understand it as: if one of your keep values is knowing everything about your partner and you want to *know* (and pride yourself) on how open you are together - it might be painful to think your partner doesn't 'trust you' with information you feel as been covered. E.g. if you were roommates and discussed finances in some way, or she has been overly open with her finances (she would have probably assumed you were, too). It is a big shock to learn your partner has \"another life,\" you know nothing about. Really, it depends on your gfs brain ahahaha. I think give it some time and it'll be sweet. In saying that if you're pretty \"new\" to financial decisions together, then she's definitely out of line. But I'm assuming since you have been together a while - and roomates - she probably expected to know \"all\" of you already. I'm similarly private, but - well, I'd want to have known before the engagement. Like, i don't care about money, but I love knowing we are on the \"same page.\" Finances are a big aspect of peoples lives.

She's annoyed because she feels entitled to have benefitted from your money and she feels she's 'missed out' for 2 years not having access to it. \n\nIn her head, she's thinking, why couldn't we have gone on some nice holidays, or why couldn't he have bought me expensive gifts for special occassions. Or why couldn't he have paid for meals out and to go places etc. \n\nShe feels entitled to that money. \n\nNow you need to be very careful. Before you get married, you need a prenup. If there is a big difference in income and savings, you need to protect yourself and your savings and investments. \nSadly you never know what may happen in the future and there's no guarantee that one day you may end up splitting up. For any number of reasons. And without a pre nup, she could seriously screw you out of a lot of money. \n\nWhen you decide to buy a house, make sure solicitors write up ownership as the percentage you put in to it. So if you put down a huge deposit, and she doesn't contribute, but you then just split the mortgage, you need to have that deposit factored in to the percentage you own. If she does put some down towards the deposit, obviously split ownership based on what you both pay in to it. It's not fair for you to put in a huge chunk to get a lower mortgage, but she owns half etc. So make sure you speak to a solicitor and her about however much you both pay in relates to the percentage you own. You could also do it that should you sell the house, you get back your deposit, then the remainder is split 50/ 50, but that's not actually fair if the price of the house has increased as your deposit would have massively affected the price of your monthly payments. Either way, speak to a solicitor to male sure your investment is protected for the future should the worst happen. \n\nIf she gets annoyed about a pre nup, or the percentage of ownership in a house etc based on your deposit input, then she's clearly focused on your money. Even though she didn't know about your money before, which is good, so you feel she loves you for who you are and not your money, it doesn't stop someone becoming money focused and entitled once they know you have money. If I married someone with loads of money, I wouldn't have problem if he wanted to protect that money. It's his money. Obviously if kids become involved, you can factor an agreement of child support in to any divorce, or housing for the kids etc, but you should still be able to protect your own assets from being taken. Again, if a woman gives up work to look after kids, and forfeits her career and pension etc, then a payment should be made to factor that in if there was a divorce, but you should still be entitled to protect your savings or investments that you owned that they haven't contributed to. So if she refuses, I'd say that's quite a concern. \n\nShe may be surprised and shocked, but at the end of the day your finances are yours and nobody else's business, especially when dating.

It\u2019s ZERO for me - and a large majority of others. It\u2019s ridiculous to think he was hiding anything. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s $160k, not $10M - enough for a good down payment, but hardly excessive or life changing (in the sense there\u2019s no need to ever work again).", "No, just like it\u2019s not okay to hide a bunch of money until marriage.

Being upset he lied by omission doesn't make her a gold digger. She's probably on edge wondering what else he's capable of hiding from her. \n\n OPs comment that he's been lucky in life, with no mention of income and saving strategies, makes me wonder if this is part of an inheritance or lawsuit settlement. Either of which would be an impactful event in OPs life that he's likely kept hidden or glossed over with his fiance.", "I would also think couples\u2019 counseling as well to root out exactly what the issue is as to why she\u2019s so upset.

She might not be a \u201cgold-digger,\u201d but her reacting this way to him having a lot of money that he didn\u2019t tell her about is a bad sign.\n\nTypical gold digger does not exactly marry poor guy and gets angry when it turns out he is rich. It is other way round - they seek rich people and get angry when it turns out those dont have money.\n\nAlso, being upset about not being told something rather large is normal and not a bad sign. For her, this is also likely a sign that her partner will not be open in future discussions about money. She might worry about how his suddenly discovered wealth affects their relationship in the long term too.", "I don't disagree that people are selfish, but it is \\_wild\\_ to me that reddit is not shocked someone has been keeping this from his \\_fiance\\_. Don't get me wrong, OP is not morally in the wrong, but that doesn't mean her reaction isn't fair. I have never been in a relationship where I haven't known how much the person I was dating had/their parents had. No, it's not a first date topic, but it does inevitably come up when I learn more about their lives, including when they offer to pay for something so we can go on a date together that's out of my budget. Money is a big part of people's lives, and to suddenly find out someone has been sitting on six figures and has not told you, when you've talked about money before, is kind of a shock. No one is the asshole here. It's just a communication error.

Now I\u2019m learning that you thought about it a whole different way, and I am upset because [whole list of other assumptions and beliefs we have programmed into us from life]. Basically, their expectations don\u2019t line up, and it leads to frustrations and hurt feelings. \n\nShe probably disclosed her finances fully a year ago when they moved in together and assumed he did the same. Now that she knows he didn\u2019t, she feels like he was hiding something from her, and she\u2019s having a strong emotional reaction. \n\nThey just need to sit down and talk it out. She needs to know his family traditions on the topic and that he wasn\u2019t hiding things because he didn\u2019t trust her. She needs to have her hurt feelings heard and validated. And then they need to get on the same page moving forward and have a good hug. \n\nSome of the biggest fights in my marriage have been about different expectations, and some of the dumbest fights in my marriage have been about different expectations. We were finishing a living room in the basement a few years ago and I thought we were going to use this entertainment center we already had. I thought we had talked about it. We had not, and my husband didn\u2019t want that entertainment center for some pretty valid reasons. But I was really frustrated because I had been planning other aspects of decor around it, and now I had to go back to the drawing board. It was dumb. I apologized like an hour later for being cranky with him, and we found an entertainment center we both liked. But it was all about different expectations, even on something that small.", "I\u2019m sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear, I was asking the person I responded to when the appropriate time is, not what is objectively correct in general.  There are very few things that are \u201cobjectively correct\u201d in relationships, it\u2019s all about what the two people in the relationship agree to.\n\nBut what I\u2019m curious about is what that person thinks is the appropriate time.  Would they actually stop a proposal if the conversation hadn\u2019t happened?  Would they break off an engagement over it?  When would be the right time to have this conversation for them?", "My wife and I do the same thing. We bought a house together two and a half years before we got married. A full year before I even proposed. Way easier to open a joint account to pay for everything involved with living expenses. \n\nWe figured out what our monthly expenses were for mortgage, utilities, food, etc. Then, we totaled up our income and figured out what percentage each person brings in and that's what percentage of that monthly figure they put into the joint account.

It's a form of disorientation that horror writers use consciously :) I first encountered this phenomenon when I was a child, and my parents casually informed me that something I thought I knew about myself was not true; it seemed like such a trivial thing that for years I couldn't really explain why it bothered me so much. I eventually realized it bothered me because, since they'd withheld relevant information, it had changed the unconditional nature of my trust in them.  \n\nOf course, these people here are not kids, and it's not realistic for a girl to expect her fiance to have told her everything there is.", "Yes. Providing a couple of grand, likely without much notice, for her dog\u2019s surgery is the sort of thing that shouldn\u2019t have passed without some comment or discussion (despite the obvious distraction of concern for her dog).

On the other hand, he's bailed her out on short notice, aka, they have in some sense discussed money, and yet he hasn't brought up the magnitude of his savings before.

I can (and do a little bit) resent her for her attitude (my parents aren't as well off, but are much more practical about gifts and would often just give us money, so we could spend it however we wanted, instead of making a big to-do by getting us gifts they wanted us to have), but at the end of the day it's not productive to be so deeply resentful that we stop talking to her.  I just keep voting for people who support universal health care, and try to make our country a place that actually supports it's citizens.\n\nI know it's hard to have people close to you that have the money to fix problems, and do things you'll never be able to do.
