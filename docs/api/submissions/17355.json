Why is your mother defending that behaviour and how old is your sister to run to mommy when she did something wrong", "NTA, so by her logic she is teaching her daughter to be a thief.", "NTA- I don't see her paying for it.  I'd buy a new one and give the receipt to her for her birthday.", "NTA. Your niece stole it.", "NTA\nYour sister and mother are basically telling your niece that she can just steal what she wants and she's not going to face any repercussions for her actions.\nAnd I can promise you that your mom will give the new Barbie to your niece....after she's destroyed your daughter's Barbie.\n\nAnd who in the Hell did your sister blow in order for her to actually tell you no about getting your child's toy just because her brat wants to play with it longer?\n\nI would replace my daughter's doll and post pictures, etc all over Facebook.\n\" Since my mother's daughter refuses to return the doll ,which her child stole, I decided to get my child a new doll. In fact, we made a day of it!  We also decided to just let my mom's other granddaughter keep the doll she took WITHOUT permission. \"\n\nWelcome to Pettyville: Population me", "NTA. And a fucking new teen thief is on the making...", "This \ud83d\udcaf", "I just wouldn\u2019t have them come over until the toy was paid for- the Mom had a chance to return it. Now is it\u2019s time to pay up or be unwelcome in her house.", "This \ud83d\udcaf", "True you\u2019re right!", "Like the idea of doing this on the sister\u2019s birthday but in theory. Her daughter shouldn\u2019t have to wait that long to get a replacement doll"]}
