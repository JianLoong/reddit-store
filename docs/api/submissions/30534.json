Her kids aren't entitled to  money from you.  You are allowed to treat your own kids how  you want.   Finally, most parents give their own kid big gifts and their niblings smaller gifts.  They don't get \"same  market value\" gifts, anyway.", "NTA. Regardless of whether you gave all if the kids cash or gave them all physical gifts, why would she expect you to spend as much on her kids as you do on theirs?", "How is giving your kids cash for a holiday any different than giving them an allowance or pocket money? SIL doesn\u2019t get to dictate what you give your kids. I also doubt that kids between the ages of 4 and 6 really understand the value of money in order to get jealous in the first place. I would bet SIL wants to pocket the cash.", "Your SIL sounds ridiculous and ignorant. Her kids aren't entitled to any presents either. It sounds like you've gifted them many a pricey gift too, so it's not like you're actually withholding love or being cheap or whatever she's trying to claim.\n\nEasy NTA.", "NTA. I don't even understand why people are upset at you guys. Like, they're your kids. If you wanted to gift them gold bars every Eid, who are they to say shit?

I can't imagine someone expecting you to gift their children the same as you do your own!", "It's a tale as old as time. The same as East Asian families where children get red envelopes for New Year, the money actually is kept by the parents \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02 The amount of time I caught my aunt keep my cousin's envelopes during Eid. I'm just throwing this accusation because SIL seemed to be the type, and this is just my personal accusation \ud83d\ude02 Also yeah, NTA. I think it's appropriate and you are NTA. Honestly, I would be happy to receive cash, but I would be happier to get something I truly want. Cash is only better when the person giving you present know nothing about you and has 99% giving you something you don't want, need, or even like. The idea of giving envelope is because it's easy especially if you have big family with many children that you only see once a year \ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nSimple solution, give money. In all honesty, it saves you a lot of time and effort.", "NTA if she would rather cash, then all the easier give the kids an envelope for Xmas.  Kids of that age honestly generally prefer toys over cash but whatever \n\nAlso does she spend the same amount of money on your kids as she does her kids? What a stupid comparison to make", "Are you supposed to spend the same amount of money on your nieces and nephews as you do on your OWN kids? And if that is the case, is your SIL doing this very same thing - spending the same on your kids for Eid as she does for her own kids for Christmas? And since she has now brought this up, is that what will happen from now on - 2024 Eids will see your children getting hundreds of pounds each? The religion issue is a false flag - she sounds like wants things more in her favour for this Christmas, but unless she will do the same come Eid, this seems like a one-way street under the guise of religious equality. \n\nKids can compare all they want, but the comparisons are only valid if the relationships are equal.  For instance, she would have a valid complaint if you didn\u2019t treat all the nieces and nephews equally (say, her kids and the kids of any other siblings or your husband), as you are aunt/uncle to all of them. I don\u2019t see why you are not allowed to make the distinction between how you treat your own kids vs how you treat kids that are not yours.  I always got more from my parents than I did from aunts and uncles.  As is justified - my parents chose to have me and nobody else. \n\nPatently NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIn my honest opinion, I get the impression that you and your husband went and gave a compromise you were okay with, and the in-laws went with it in order to have access to your kids. This is emphasized by you saying that they kept you guys at arm's length until the eldest child was born.\n\nRe-evaluate the situation, and eventually consider the option of not giving something, be it cash or toys, but spending quality time with them if possible. If this can't be done, give them the option to chose: either you get this envelope with cash or this gift. Your choice.\n\nAlso, given the attitude they're giving you, I would consider taking a step back in the relationship and reconsider how you interact with each other. On top of that, think about going to therapy, both individual and couple counseling, in order to be sure you and your husband are on the same page here.", "NTA, but like\u2026is there an issue with just saying \u201chey this is how we do it in our religion, and we thought we were honoring your religion by doing it your way. If you want to adopt our tradition and make cash the gift we can do that.\u201d? \n\nI mean it seems like it would make Christmas shopping much easier, and it would shut SIL up.

I'm christened but Christmas in our family is a purely a symbolic holiday of good will. My partner is Muslim.  It's a strange cultural issue that's hard to cross.

Your SIL should have talked with your husband 1:1, she's simply out of line here.\n\nIf I may make a suggestion, you can let cool things down a bit and the two of you talk again with her and get husband. I'd mention the fact that the presents you gave routinely exceeded 100 pounds, so you don't see how you treated her children differently. You can also offer to give your nieces/nephews cash _instead_ of presents next Christmas if that's what they want - as this would be exactly what your kids are getting.\n\nI get the in-laws point in treating all kids equally (it's probably coloured by your SIL's version of the story) but I don't agree with what they're saying here. Have they talked with their grandchildren about that, have they complained? So far it seems like an adult-only conversation? \n\nConsidering that faith takes up so much room in your description, there has been comparatively little consideration for the Christian values or the Christian idea of what giving a gift to someone means. It might be not relevant but it be might worth to figure out if that's an aspect worth talking about with your SIL. \n\nYou're acknowledging different faiths and traditions, I'm not yet sure SIL fully appreciates that. So, it would be good for her to give you a better understanding how important of a role faith plays for her in her family's traditions - because if everything should be equal then she needs to be clear(er) about all aspects of the holiday, not just the presents.", "NTA.\nSo she gives nothing to your children and now throws a tantrum over what you give your own kids in comparison to hers and you question if you're TA here??? \nNope nope nope! \nSIL is just acting entitled. You could be giving a gift of cash every day to your children and give hers a symbolic toy for one holiday a year and you still won't be TA. \nFor handling different faith/traditions part --- My dad is agnostic and mom Christian, so when were kids he will give us gifts and cash for NY while mom will go above and beyond with the Christmas gifts - it was never an issue, but we were both THEIR kids. \nIMO you're completely in your right to treat your own children better in any way and give them bigger gifts. Even if we put aside the underlying issues here (which are valid too).", "NTA.

If anything at all.\n\nFinally, explain to everyone how it\u2019s probably a lot worse for kids their age to be seeing their cousins get new toys and they don\u2019t receive anything than what it is for the cousins to know that your kids have some money in a savings account. \n\nI\u2019m assuming that your in laws didn\u2019t have a close relationship with your husband because he accepted Islam. But now that you\u2019re all on good terms, they should be setting some sort of precedent for their grandchildren - treat everyone equally for both Christmas and Eid!!! \nJust a thought \ud83d\udcad\u2026", "NTA - I mean most people get more from their parents than they are going to their aunts/uncles. So IDK why this is an issue because whether you give them cash or gifts, you're still going to give your kids more. This is just your SIL being ungrateful and money hungry.", "NTA - maybe I'm missing something but my parents*always* spent more on my Christmas gifts than they did on my cousins, and vice versa. I would get one or two gifts (if that) from extended family and a handful from my parents and Santa. \n\nNot to mention the irony of your SIL coming to collect free food and then moaning that you aren't generous enough.... The audacity of some people.", "NTA. You're trying very hard to manage your husbands families expectations and they seem completely disinterested in showing any understanding towards you and your kids. Do your husbands parents give the kids any money for Eid? Also, bit rich for his sister to complain about you giving her kids \"cheap gifts\" when she never gives your children anything for Eid. How rude of her.", "NTA I think your compromise was perfect. And is she trying to say you should be spending as much on her kids as you do on your own?!? No parent I know does that. If she wants her kids to have cash, she\u2019s free to give it to them. How you spend your money or who you spend it on is none of her business.", "NTA This really shouldn\u2019t be a religious issue either. Everyone knows peoples kid\u2019s ,siblings and parents usually get more from each other than from like aunt to niece or vice versa. And the idea of I don\u2019t want my kids to have stupid cheap stuff either is dumb to many times growing up I went into dollar tree and dollar general with a few dollars to buy my parents and siblings, and grandma(who has expensive taste). something for gifts. You know what among all that fancy stuff my gift sits in her kitchen because it is the thought that counts. Even though it was dumb stuff it meant a lot to at least try. Her idea that it has to be fair is ridiculous I got presents from my parents with what they could afford and a little bit of stuff from my grandma. Gifts and money is things not everyone is able to receive and not everyone is gonna receive equally that is life. Your SIL might want to take the cash I know that sometimes can happen. If this continues to be a problem maybe stop doing gifts for them so they realize how much above the norm you do already.", "That's ridiculous. I gift toys to both my kids and niblings. However the toys I buy for my children are generally more expensive (even if the ones for my niblings are not cheap) because they are my children. My brother doesn't care and probably does the same. I agree you should try to spend the same amount for your niblings on your side and your niblings on your husband side even if you give cash to the first ones and toys to the last ones but you don't have to limit you regarding your children (but you are right for not giving them money in front of your niblings). NTA of course", "\"How dare you spend more money on your own children than on mine!\"\n\nAlso, I can't imagine my parents calling to say that I need to give my kids worse gifts so my niblings aren't jealous. Not that it sounds like the niblings actually care or notice, it's just the adults trying to police your household decisions.\n\nNTA but your SIL sounds like a real treasure.", "NTA. We spend more money on our children than nieces and nephews. I thought that was the norm. We also have an agreed upon limit for Christmas and birthdays.", "That is so weird. We do Christmas gifts and Eidi, and I give both to nieces and nephews on one side, only Christmas to the other side. But my kids get more from us because we\u2019re their parents. Which I can understand if a niece or nephew asked us, but not a sibling", "Wait, your SIL is pissed because you gave YOUR CHILDREN more than hers?  What?  That's literally mental.  I spent about \u00a330-40 on my Nephew and upwards of \u00a3150 on our 3 children each.  I'd never spend more on my nephew than my own children.  That's such an odd concept?", "NTA. SIL can't play with the toy truck but she can take the money. Simple.", "NTA- sister wants the money for herself. DO NOT GIVE THEM MONEY. Instead buy them a small gift based on their interest and then open them up a college account that cannot be touched by the parents. Give them a card and have them open the gifts with their grandparents, saying \"Since it has been pointed out that you no longer need expensive items, we have decided to accept this request and a college account has been opened in your name. Grandparents or other family members can give money into this account but it cannot be used until graduation and college admission. That it is ONLY for college and if the child decides NOT to attend it will A- be available for a house purchase at the age of 30 (or whatever you decide, but definitely older than say 21 or 25 because they need to learn to manage finances first) or it will roll over for the next generation (their kids college).\" This way they get a small gift of their likes (depending on age, small doll, my little pony, hot wheels, funko pop etc) to open and enjoy but the majority is for their future. Most Christmas presents given to kids are basically useless after a few months or a year because they either break the item or have moved on to new interests and then it gets donated or sold for way less money. You could even put in an exception that IF the child after a certain age needs a certain item for school or even therapy (like an ipad or laptop) the child must meet with you or send a video stating their case and that you will decide if you will contribute to or buy the item. (IF you do make sure you engrave the item so it cannot be returned).", "The cousins have never even seen our kids gifts\n\nWe give them the cash envelope in the morning after prayers, take a couple photos, and then deposit it into their bank accounts the next day.\n\nThe only reason SIL even saw it last time was because she came earlier than usual to collect food and because Husband was getting 6yo to practice times tables with the notes", "There's no way a 6 and 4-year-old prefer cash.
