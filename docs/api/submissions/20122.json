If he doesn't want his veggies too be at risk of meat juices, he can buy a plastic box to keep them in.\n\nHowever if your meat does leak, it's up to you to clean it.\n\nAdditionally he should be washing his produce anyway, the farming equipment that processes good food makes no distinction between rodents and root vegetables.\n\nAnd him moving your stuff without your permission definitely moves him into AH territory.", "NTA.

But I am guessing he moved your meat to above your yoghurt so you could understand why it's unpleasant to think that the blood might leak onto your food and ruin it. If he does it again, then he's out of line but I can't blame him for doing this to make you understand that it's a big deal.\n\nYou should understand that it's on you to find a way to stop your meat juices from leaking to his side of the fridge. And I don't want to be rude but this is an incredibly easy thing to do, just get a tupperware box that's the size of your half of the crisper drawer and put your meat into that. Or transfer the raw meat into smaller sealed boxes before putting it in the fridge. This is all very basic very easy stuff and perfectly reasonable expectation. I'm not sure why you wouldn't have done this straight away the first time he brought the issue up.", "NTA. I lived with a vegan and shared a fridge for 6 years, and this seems bizarre. If roomate is bothered by the idea of leaking meat (seriously, how often did his steaks leak everywhere pre vegan), maybe just suggest that he fortifies the drawer? He can line it with a silicone baking mat or something so the holes in the bottom don't allow anything to touch. I know that solution might not have as much ventilation, but usually crisper drawers have another vent at the top. Regardless, it seems like you both will stand your ground and keep getting more mad so maybe talk it out to find viable solutions. Someone suggested a small fridge just for his veggies, which may be an option, albeit an annoying one if your place is small, etc.", "nta", "ESH. Sounds like childish tit-for-tat. Perhaps you can invest in a good airtight box to properly keep your raw meat to be eaten within the day so you can store it anywhere in the fridge and also prevent leakage. Friend also need to realize being vegan doesn't mean the dietary high ground. If you want people to respect your dietary preference then start by respecting the fact that not the whole world follow said preference.\n\nHopefully both of you can solve this super trivial matter like mature adults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s a vegetable crisper not a vegetable hygiene maintenance drawer, they won\u2019t get sullied just by virtue of not being in their special little box, you ninny. The only thing the OP should do is put their meat in another container, otherwise, they\u2019re not doing anything wrong. You\u2019re a fucking incompetent moron if you think the vegetable crisper is so precious that nothing else can go in their because \u201cthat\u2019s not it\u2019s purpose\u201d you\u2019re a fuckin joke.", "Thank you", "What happened in the world of fridge design that this doesn't exist anymore!?\n\nShe said \"ingenious\" and damn was she RIGHT!", "You should be washing vegetables before eating them unwashed veg is a common source of ecoli", "I'm not saying they can't go anywhere else, just that the roommate isn't being unreasonable to ask that the meat not go in there so they can keep their veggies down there.\n\nBut yes, the main concern is meat leaking, so had OP said \"I'd rather keep it down there, but I'll make sure it's sealed, because of course it would be bad if it leaked on your food, especially raw vegetables\", then fair play. But he didn't do that, he brushed it off entirely.\n\nAlso, I'm very sorry, I didn't realise you felt this strongly about the flexible uses of a crisper drawer. Didn't think this comment could make anyone angry. Please feel free to put whatever you want in there if it makes you happy.", "I want pull out shelves!!", "I don't know about you but I don't wash my vegetables with hot, soapy water, which is how you sanitize surfaces where raw meat has been prepped or stored. Neither can you wash away meat juice that the vegetables may have absorbed.", "Simply washing the vegetables won\u2019t kill the bacteria from meat juices if it were to come into contact with it", "I didn\u2019t know everyone lost their mind and started acting like the crisper drawer is some precious real estate that must never be misused but here we are"]}
