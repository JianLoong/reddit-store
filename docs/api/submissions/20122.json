We basically split the fridge down the middle with little dividers, I get left and he gets right. \n\nWell recently he went vegan. I thought nothing would change, since we don't share food. However recently he asked me to stop putting raw meats in the bottom crisper (little drawer thing in the fridge) because the juices could leak onto the other side and get on his vegetables and such he puts down there. \n\nWell, in the past he's put stuff other than meat in his side of the crisper, so I asked if it wasn't a problem then why is it now? He said it was because he basically only puts vegetables down there and doesn't want them contaminated. I'm not usually so stubborn, but that's the best place to put the meat to keep it fresh, so I told him it'll be fine if he just leaves it, but if he really wants to he can just move his stuff elsewhere. He said there was no room, but I basically said that it's his side of the fridge and that's his problem. \n\nThat wasn't the end of it though. Yesterday I saw him touching my side of the fridge. I didn't want to be childish, so I just shrugged it off and didn't mention it. However, I saw that he'd moved my raw meat and put it right on top of  some yogurt I had bought. Not just that, but it was VERY precariously perched on there, it nearly fell when I opened the fridge. \n\nI was kinda mad, because what if the juices DID leak? They'd go right onto or into the yogurt and get me sick. He was complaining about that, so in my mind it's a bit hypocritical. Also the meat would be less fresh, it could've fell, and he's messing with my stuff even though we agreed not to do that to each other.

If he doesn't want his veggies too be at risk of meat juices, he can buy a plastic box to keep them in.\n\nHowever if your meat does leak, it's up to you to clean it.\n\nAdditionally he should be washing his produce anyway, the farming equipment that processes good food makes no distinction between rodents and root vegetables.\n\nAnd him moving your stuff without your permission definitely moves him into AH territory.", "NTA.

But I am guessing he moved your meat to above your yoghurt so you could understand why it's unpleasant to think that the blood might leak onto your food and ruin it. If he does it again, then he's out of line but I can't blame him for doing this to make you understand that it's a big deal.\n\nYou should understand that it's on you to find a way to stop your meat juices from leaking to his side of the fridge. And I don't want to be rude but this is an incredibly easy thing to do, just get a tupperware box that's the size of your half of the crisper drawer and put your meat into that. Or transfer the raw meat into smaller sealed boxes before putting it in the fridge. This is all very basic very easy stuff and perfectly reasonable expectation. I'm not sure why you wouldn't have done this straight away the first time he brought the issue up.", "NTA. I lived with a vegan and shared a fridge for 6 years, and this seems bizarre. If roomate is bothered by the idea of leaking meat (seriously, how often did his steaks leak everywhere pre vegan), maybe just suggest that he fortifies the drawer? He can line it with a silicone baking mat or something so the holes in the bottom don't allow anything to touch. I know that solution might not have as much ventilation, but usually crisper drawers have another vent at the top. Regardless, it seems like you both will stand your ground and keep getting more mad so maybe talk it out to find viable solutions. Someone suggested a small fridge just for his veggies, which may be an option, albeit an annoying one if your place is small, etc.", "nta", "ESH. Sounds like childish tit-for-tat. Perhaps you can invest in a good airtight box to properly keep your raw meat to be eaten within the day so you can store it anywhere in the fridge and also prevent leakage. Friend also need to realize being vegan doesn't mean the dietary high ground. If you want people to respect your dietary preference then start by respecting the fact that not the whole world follow said preference.\n\nHopefully both of you can solve this super trivial matter like mature adults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If there's a single drawer, it would be for either meat or veggies, but not both.

Nearly ready to eat (needs washed/rinsed, ie, fruits and veggies) next. Needs prepared next, down to meat. A quick and dirty (no pun intended) way to think of how to organize the fridge is by cooking temp, from lowest to highest, with lowest cooking temp going up top and highest cooking temp on the bottom. In reality, everybody's fridge, including mine, looks more like a game of Tetris where stuff is shoved in based on where it fits.\n\nMeat goes in the very bottom of the fridge, period.
