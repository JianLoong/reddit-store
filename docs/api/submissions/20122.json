Consider dividing the fridge by shelf instead of straight down the middle.", "NTA. He should leave your stuff alone. If he's got a problem with it he can move his own stuff or get his own fridge.

If he doesn't want his veggies too be at risk of meat juices, he can buy a plastic box to keep them in.\n\nHowever if your meat does leak, it's up to you to clean it.\n\nAdditionally he should be washing his produce anyway, the farming equipment that processes good food makes no distinction between rodents and root vegetables.\n\nAnd him moving your stuff without your permission definitely moves him into AH territory.", "NTA. Roomate is though. How the hell do they think meat will leak out of a drawer?

But I am guessing he moved your meat to above your yoghurt so you could understand why it's unpleasant to think that the blood might leak onto your food and ruin it. If he does it again, then he's out of line but I can't blame him for doing this to make you understand that it's a big deal.\n\nYou should understand that it's on you to find a way to stop your meat juices from leaking to his side of the fridge. And I don't want to be rude but this is an incredibly easy thing to do, just get a tupperware box that's the size of your half of the crisper drawer and put your meat into that. Or transfer the raw meat into smaller sealed boxes before putting it in the fridge. This is all very basic very easy stuff and perfectly reasonable expectation. I'm not sure why you wouldn't have done this straight away the first time he brought the issue up.", "NTA. I lived with a vegan and shared a fridge for 6 years, and this seems bizarre. If roomate is bothered by the idea of leaking meat (seriously, how often did his steaks leak everywhere pre vegan), maybe just suggest that he fortifies the drawer? He can line it with a silicone baking mat or something so the holes in the bottom don't allow anything to touch. I know that solution might not have as much ventilation, but usually crisper drawers have another vent at the top. Regardless, it seems like you both will stand your ground and keep getting more mad so maybe talk it out to find viable solutions. Someone suggested a small fridge just for his veggies, which may be an option, albeit an annoying one if your place is small, etc.", "nta", "ESH. Sounds like childish tit-for-tat. Perhaps you can invest in a good airtight box to properly keep your raw meat to be eaten within the day so you can store it anywhere in the fridge and also prevent leakage. Friend also need to realize being vegan doesn't mean the dietary high ground. If you want people to respect your dietary preference then start by respecting the fact that not the whole world follow said preference.\n\nHopefully both of you can solve this super trivial matter like mature adults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But honestly, no food will go bad if things are not on the right shelf, as long as they are in the fridge.", "That\u2019s the thing, all the vegetables will actually get bloody. I\u2019m not even vegan but meat juices on all my vegetables is disgusting not to mention unsafe. I don\u2019t always cook all my veggies either, some go in salads. Ugh OP is YTA for this", "Most fridges have them, it\u2019s the drawers in the bottom (do little euro fridges have them? I don\u2019t know) They\u2019re designed to be more humid so vegetables stay fresher longer, supposedly. Idk if I believe they do anything.", "it doesn't fucking matter... his shit is leaking all over the fridge", "Roommates are allowed to change their preferences and OP is making questionable food safety choices here regardless of the veganism.", "In the vegetable crisper.

Meat does not!", "No, he's storing his meat in the VEGETABLE drawer, not on the bottom shelf where it belongs", "Not where I'm from, yogurt containers usually have a foil lid with a plastic cap on top. You can just rinse off the foil lid, it's air tight, nothing would seep through. Vegetables are usually loose in a paper bag or thin plastic bag if at all.

OP is definitely the inconsiderate party here.", "One, vegetables rarely come \u201cin bags\u201d. Not to mention storing them in bags kinda defeats the point of the crisper drawer. \n\nTwo, yogurt lids are not porous.  Even the foil lids could be rinsed off and removed without ever contaminating the yogurt. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s smart to put meat on top of yogurt, but it\u2019s fucking ridiculous to put it in the crisper drawer next to vegetables that will be eaten raw.", "The roommate going vegan has no relevance to me in this case. It's about basic food hygiene and a simple request to get meat out of the crisper meant for vegetables. It was a simple request but OP is making it a huge issue.", "Doesn't give the roommate the right to mess with his stuff.. op said no", ">Meat packaging leaks all the time\n\nI've never had meat packaging leak while in the fridge.

It stays in the fridge for at most a few days before I have time to process it.  It has never leaked but if OP's roommate is worried then roommate should be the one 'fixing' the potential issue themself.  So containers is a possible solution.  They can also put veggies in ziplock bag.", "Oh yeah, it's super gross, especially if it sits for even half an hour before you see/realise it happened. And if it happens say, when everyone's in work, and it's a few hours before it's cleaned, oh boy have you got a stinky fridge! At least the container can be closed/taken straight out the fridge!", "I have had this happened.

Yogurt is in sealed packaging that can be washed,  celery for example is going to pull the bacteria INSIDE because of capillary structures in the plant, most of us did the food coloring +celery experiment in grade school.", "I think the problem for OP is the roommate demands OP to stop using space they have always used because the roommate changed their diet. I am all for problem solving, but I would be annoyed if someone touched my stuff or just expected to get their way without a discussion.", "For food safety, meat always goes on the bottom of the fridge.

Food safety. It isn\u2019t rocket science. If a veggie doesn\u2019t require cooking and it\u2019s ready to eat, it needs to be kept higher up in the fridge. If meat is uncooked, it needs to be kept lower. \n\nReduce the risk of contamination by how you organize your fridge.", "Well she didnt put the meat directly on top of his vegetables so its not the same.", "There are an odd number of shelves and one crisper drawer, so it's not really practical to split it that way.", "6 of us shared a fridge in college and did this!", "Yeah I\u2019ve literally never heard of that in all the share houses I\u2019ve lived in", "You mean the beer crisper?", "Yes, that is true however I would like to point out that in the past I personally have had issues with my meat dripping into the vegetable drawer. So keeping your meat on the shelf separate and above your veggie drawer is not automatically as safety guarantee. That's not me trying to be a b****, that's just me giving people a heads up that it is possible and it can happen more often than you realize.", "The meat should never go above the veggies regardless though. If the meat leaks, the meat leaks. It\u2019s better to have the meat at the lowest level and foods that are easier to be contaminated up above where any potential contamination can happen. \n\nSeparate storage bins will absolutely help, but the veggies and meat shouldn\u2019t be stored side by side anyway.", "Where is it stated that it's actively leaking? The roommate is worried about POTENTIAL weekend, not leaking that's already currently happening.\nSo no, it's not already a leaking all over the fridge, And you would know that if you actually read the post instead of thinking that you did.", "But if the problem is about meat leaking, what happens if the meat is not at the bottom? It leaks onto everything below and you have the same fucking problem with more contamination!", ">OP is being petty about it for some strange reason\n\nbecause his roommate is the one who wants things to change, the onus is on him, they both had their meat in the bottom drawer with no issues, it's only now an issue because his roommate changed his diet.", "Storing your meat on the bottom shelf can cause it to leak into the vegetable crisp or anyways. I've seen it happen. So placing your meat on the bottom shelf while putting all of your vegetables in the crisper drawer doesn't automatically guarantee their safety. Just a heads up, not trying to be a b****, not trying to discredit you, just giving you a heads up for the future. It can happen, and it does happen more than you would think. Not all the time, but I have definitely had my fair share of having to throw out a lot of veggies and meat because the juice leaked from the bottom shelf into the drawer. It was really annoying, \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2d", "I'm guessing you missed the part where it's been fine for a year and is now only a problem because roommate has gone vegan. So roommate wasn't worried about contamination when they weren't vegan but now it matters so much so to disrespect the previously agreed house rules when it comes to the fridge rather than making the suggestion of a container to OP.\n\nI find it funny how you think it's OP's responsibility to sort out the problem the roommate just invented after over a year of the exact same situation. If roommate wants to fix it they provide adequate solution to it for both parties, not just make demands.", "I was 100% std free until I caught an std", "And I've never had a car break down on me, so therefore that never happens either.", "God, I\u2019m stupid.
