We're friends so we're fine sharing a few things in the apartment, but one thing we rarely share is food. Unless we order a pizza or something, what's mine is mine and what's his is his, no exception. So no eating someone else's food, and don't touch their side of the fridge. We basically split the fridge down the middle with little dividers, I get left and he gets right. \n\nWell recently he went vegan. I thought nothing would change, since we don't share food. However recently he asked me to stop putting raw meats in the bottom crisper (little drawer thing in the fridge) because the juices could leak onto the other side and get on his vegetables and such he puts down there. \n\nWell, in the past he's put stuff other than meat in his side of the crisper, so I asked if it wasn't a problem then why is it now? He said it was because he basically only puts vegetables down there and doesn't want them contaminated. I'm not usually so stubborn, but that's the best place to put the meat to keep it fresh, so I told him it'll be fine if he just leaves it, but if he really wants to he can just move his stuff elsewhere. He said there was no room, but I basically said that it's his side of the fridge and that's his problem. \n\nThat wasn't the end of it though. Yesterday I saw him touching my side of the fridge. I didn't want to be childish, so I just shrugged it off and didn't mention it. However, I saw that he'd moved my raw meat and put it right on top of  some yogurt I had bought. Not just that, but it was VERY precariously perched on there, it nearly fell when I opened the fridge. \n\nI was kinda mad, because what if the juices DID leak? They'd go right onto or into the yogurt and get me sick. He was complaining about that, so in my mind it's a bit hypocritical. Also the meat would be less fresh, it could've fell, and he's messing with my stuff even though we agreed not to do that to each other. I confronted him about it but he said I'm being childish and said that he's going to continue to move my stuff as to not mess his up.\n\nI just put my stuff back where I had it and told him not to mess with it.

This way you can still put your meat where it fits best on your side of the fridge AND you keep it from potentially \"leaking\" on his side.  They don't even have to be expensive.  A Ziploc bag can be easily turned inside out and washed to reuse it to avoid having excess plastic waste.  \n\nI've only ever had well packaged meat \"leak\" a handful of times ever in my life but sometimes you just...do a little bit of silly compromise to keep the peace.", "NTA. He should have had a discussion with you about re-organizing the fridge.  However normally the crisper is for vegetables, meat normally goes on the bottom shelf.", "INFO: Does the fridge not have a vegetable crisper and a meat drawer?  If so, why not just keep the whole meat drawer (usually at the bottom) for yourself and give him the vegetable drawer.  Failing that, take the dividers out so you get the whole bottom shelf and he gets the whole next shelf up.\n\nBy putting the meat on top of the yoghurt, I feel like he was probably trying to make you see his point of view.  After all, he didn't want the exact same thing to happen to his vege.\n\nIn my opinion ESH.", "NTA. But you need to understand that meat can contaminate food that is meant to be consumed raw like vegetables. You both should consider getting a couple plastic boxes, or custom acrylic boxes to separate the shared crisper space and preventing cross-contamination.", "Hard NTA from me.\n\nThe one with the restrictions are responsible for ensuring that their person requirements are met.\n\nThat said, isn\u2019t your meat already in a bag? Why would it leak juices?!", "EHS. If it's not a big to rearrange his side, it's not a big deal to rearrange yours. The drawer is designed for vegetables, your meat will be just as fresh if placed on the lowest shelf. And you should place meat on a tray or something for the juices anyway.\n\nI also find it ironic that you're getting bent out of shape over the meat juices potentially contaminating your yoghurt but when he brought up his concerns about it, you shrugged him off.\n\nHe shouldn't be touching your side though if that's against the rules of your place.", "NTA but there is a technically correct way to organize foods in fridges regardless: [https://www.highspeedtraining.co.uk/hub/fridge-shelves-storing-food/](https://www.highspeedtraining.co.uk/hub/fridge-shelves-storing-food/) \n\nI've never had a problem with meat \"leaking\" onto stuff but if it's that big a deal, then simply put it on a plate or tray (problem fixed!).", "NTA. Even if he ate meat, leaky meat juices would ruin the vegetables anyway so it seems a little odd that he'd only be concerned about it now. \n\nIf rearranging the fridge isn't an option maybe use some plastic boxes for the meat as an additional layer of safety.", "NTA. He can put his veggies in containers.", "NTA. Presumably the meat is bagged/sealed and in the event that it did leak you'd financially compensate for the ruined veggies? Meat juices would ruin whatever was in there even if he still ate meat so it seems a little odd that he's hyper sensitive about it now. \n\nThis doesn't need to spiral. Consider dividing the fridge by shelf instead of straight down the middle.", "NTA. He should leave your stuff alone. If he's got a problem with it he can move his own stuff or get his own fridge. Guess you could put meat in a sealable container. That's what I do to help keep it fresh.", "Not my monkey, not my circus...but why are you so insistent on putting meat in the vegetable crisper ?  Where do you put your fresh fruits and veggies ?\n\nESH because you both seem to care more about winning than about compromise to improve an otherwise decent roommate situation.", "YTA, meat always goes to the bottom if not no where near raw vegetables. Your yogurt has a lid (I assume) and vegetables usually are not packed is anything aside from a bag and may be eaten raw so I don't think it's a fair comparison.The hypocrisy to me is that you don't see you doing it to him as wrong but are upset with him putting the meat over your yogurt.", "Soon you'll need separate fridges.", "NTA, he had chosen this diet. If he doesn't want his veggies too be at risk of meat juices, he can buy a plastic box to keep them in.\n\nHowever if your meat does leak, it's up to you to clean it.\n\nAdditionally he should be washing his produce anyway, the farming equipment that processes good food makes no distinction between rodents and root vegetables.\n\nAnd him moving your stuff without your permission definitely moves him into AH territory.", "NTA. Roomate is though. How the hell do they think meat will leak out of a drawer? Best place to put meat in a fridge is at the lowest point.", "NTA, if he wants to keep his vegetables uncontaminated he can buy himself a mini fridge", "I think mostly YTA in this situation.\n\nHe shouldn't be moving your stuff. But I am guessing he moved your meat to above your yoghurt so you could understand why it's unpleasant to think that the blood might leak onto your food and ruin it. If he does it again, then he's out of line but I can't blame him for doing this to make you understand that it's a big deal.\n\nYou should understand that it's on you to find a way to stop your meat juices from leaking to his side of the fridge. And I don't want to be rude but this is an incredibly easy thing to do, just get a tupperware box that's the size of your half of the crisper drawer and put your meat into that. Or transfer the raw meat into smaller sealed boxes before putting it in the fridge. This is all very basic very easy stuff and perfectly reasonable expectation. I'm not sure why you wouldn't have done this straight away the first time he brought the issue up.", "NTA. I lived with a vegan and shared a fridge for 6 years, and this seems bizarre. If roomate is bothered by the idea of leaking meat (seriously, how often did his steaks leak everywhere pre vegan), maybe just suggest that he fortifies the drawer? He can line it with a silicone baking mat or something so the holes in the bottom don't allow anything to touch. I know that solution might not have as much ventilation, but usually crisper drawers have another vent at the top. Regardless, it seems like you both will stand your ground and keep getting more mad so maybe talk it out to find viable solutions. Someone suggested a small fridge just for his veggies, which may be an option, albeit an annoying one if your place is small, etc.", "nta", "ESH. Sounds like childish tit-for-tat. Perhaps you can invest in a good airtight box to properly keep your raw meat to be eaten within the day so you can store it anywhere in the fridge and also prevent leakage. Friend also need to realize being vegan doesn't mean the dietary high ground. If you want people to respect your dietary preference then start by respecting the fact that not the whole world follow said preference.\n\nHopefully both of you can solve this super trivial matter like mature adults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
