I'm sure your niece really looks forward to it, and considers it special. Your niece is learning to share her home, and her father, with her new stepsister. I'm not so sure she should have to share this day as well, even if SIL does pay for her daughter. That doesn't mean you can't start a different tradition with both of them though!", "Nta\n\nYou've known your niece for 15 years, and have prly been close for that whole time, sounds like you may have just met his new step daughter, so it'll take more than just then getting married for her to start feeling like family, and not just \"brother's new wife's daughter\".", "NTA. Your SIL invited your step niece; the one doing the inviting should also do the paying. I think you should find something else for the 3 of you to do together and keep this special thing just between you and your niece.", "NTA. \nFirst of all it\u2019s your money and nobody should be allowed to dictate to you how you spend it and on top of that the stuff you have planned sounds like a pretty expensive day so why should you have to treat 2 kids to a day out because she decided she wants her to tag along? The fact that you\u2019re agreeing to include her on this special thing you and your niece do should be enough.", "NTA, that's a significant change with a new cost. If she wants her daughter included in the tradition she's got to be willing to cover it but I will also say as the family dynamics change I would have also taken it upon myself to work something out for the new family member. They're (girls) both a part of your family now.", "NTA: if SIL is going to butt in then she can pay for it.", "NTA and all this talk from others saying you should start a new tradition with your brother\u2019s stepdaughter are wrong! No one should tell you how to spend your time or money. If you want to do things with just your niece then do so.", "You have a longstanding tradition with your niece. How does she feel about her new step cousin being included?\n\nBut it's not like this other child has been a part of your family for long. The assumption she should just be included is a lot. NTA", "NTA I don't get these people who try and force themselves in to long standing traditions.\nIf she thinks it's a nice tradition she can start doing it with her own daughter.", "I read this same post 2 months ago.", "If your brother has another child with this SIL, then would you pay? If yes, YTA. Nobody should dictate how you spend your money, but favoritism is cruel. If he considers her a daughter...Maybe keep that tradition, for your niece's birthday, and create a second day, where you just do something, all 3 of you, like a movie & ice cream.", "**ESH**   \n\nIs your brother father to your bio-niece or is this a different brother?   If it's the same, have you been trying to make up for your niece's \"broken\" family life?   Your brother married and got an instant family, you should treat your new step-niece as family.   That doesn't mean that she should get the treatment as your niece, she should get some sort of attention.    I don't think she should be included in your annual tradition with your niece, that's between the two of you.    \n\nIt would be nice for you to set up a different getting to know you activity with the step-niece -- an outing that isn't just about buying stuff.   Talk to your brother to discover what the child (she is a child with feelings) likes then set up a trip that involves what she likes.\n\nYou have been in your bio-niece's life since the beginning, it's understandable that you would be willing to spend on her.   Remember, you could be in this other girl's life for the rest of her life.  Do you really want to start out making her feel excluded?   You need to talk to your brother about this.\n\nAnd start making plans for Christmas that include the two girls without favoritism.", "ESH. It\u2019s unreasonable for SIL to expect to to just accept your new step niece into your longstanding tradition with open arms. How does SIL\u2019s family treat your niece, and do they include her on everything step niece does? I bet they don\u2019t. \n\nThat said, even though she\u2019s not your biological niece, this girl is part of your extended family now. It would be in everyone\u2019s best interests if you include her in other ways and keep the favouritism to an absolute minimum.", "YTA you should accept your brothers choice of family and treat them all the same, imagine how your actions would make the daughter feel.  \nI am adopted by my father, youngest sister is his. visit to grandma on his side , grandma offers to give some record to youngest sister and she says no. i said can I have it grandma. her reply \"i am not giving it to you.\" so despite her sons choice to marry and take on a a large family his mother (may she burn in hell) Said this to me a 12 year old.  \ncant tell you how upset i was at the preferential treatment by her.   \nSo maybe stop being the arsehole and accept your brother choice in family.", "\u201conce a year\u2026\u201d. You can\u2019t foot the bill for the 15 yr old???  It\u2019s one thing if you just want some time alone with your niece, but it\u2019s weird if you\u2019re objecting only to paying the extra cost and not intruding on the special occasion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Start a new tradition with both of them, but keep this one only with your niece. It will be really important to her.", "This is the way to do it. Start a new Tradition with both of them. You can tune it down a little. Like Pizza and the movies or so and keep your niece Tradition.\nAs a niece, this is such an important thing.", "Agree, OP, is there a special place/location you don\u2019t go to often?\nMaybe do a different class with both of them once/year. So one year ceramic, another cooking, another one of those paint and sip things. etc. Then you can lean in to both their interests and bonus, an activity gives people something to focus on if they don\u2019t want to be super engaging at the moment.", "I assume it's the OP's niece's step-sister rather than step-cousin. If it's the step-cousin then it's not even a delicate situation that needs consideration about how best to handle it; the OP can just tell her SIL to piss off.", "Well yeah but that's different.

Such ridiculous advice!!", "[deleted]", "NTA in the original situation but your comments make you seem a bit like an AH\u2026\n\nYou should keep the tradition with just you and your niece - but since you now also have a step niece maybe make a tradition with both girls together or even with your new niece separately to get to know her. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s expected that you have as close of a relationship with step niece but I do think putting in some effort to welcome her into the family would go a long way with her (and for her mum and most likely your brother).\n\nGoodluck and just be kind - mixed families can be hard to adjust to at the start", "She may be a new niece but to not call her a real niece is fucked up", "If that's different you can always find something to make it different...favouritism.", "So you don\u2019t think step children are part of the family.

Of course I prefer my niece to a girl I met recently", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that straightforward. Of course you are unlikely to develop the same type of bond with a teenager you\u2019ve just met vs someone who you have lived and watched grow over the years", "But that\u2019s not what SIL wants. OP said she\u2019d pay for the ice cream but clearly SIL wants her daughter to get exactly the same treatment.
