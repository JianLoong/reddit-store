That doesn't mean you can't start a different tradition with both of them though!", "Nta\n\nYou've known your niece for 15 years, and have prly been close for that whole time, sounds like you may have just met his new step daughter, so it'll take more than just then getting married for her to start feeling like family, and not just \"brother's new wife's daughter\".", "NTA.

You\u2019re saying it\u2019s incredibly cruel not to take this new teenager who she might have only met a few times before out shopping spending hundreds of dollars on her? \n\nYou\u2019re failing to take into consideration a lot of things but most importantly the fact that since this is a once a year tradition maybe OP has saved all year for this. Maybe OP cannot afford to spend another several hundreds of dollars on a second kid. From what OP said it doesn\u2019t even sound like she knows this teenager very well.\n\nOP has said she doesn\u2019t mind if the other kid comes along as long as mom pays for the majority of the items. The fact that mom pitched a fit over the fact that OP would not be dropping a lot of money on a child she apparently hasn\u2019t known that long does seems to indicate she only wants her kid to go along to take advantage of free stuff. Any reasonable mom would take this into consideration and give the aunt (who, once again, is willing to include the new kid into the tradition) the money to buy things. And did you ever think she was only offering to pitch in for ice cream because that\u2019s all she would be able to afford? Should OP tell her niece that from now on she\u2019s only going to spend half the amount on her? That the brand new stepsister will be now be the recipient of half of her traditional shopping items? \n\nIf brother and new wife have a brand new kid then that would present the opportunity to bring the new baby into the tradition slowly. Young children can be appeased with cheaper items where older teens (who are almost driving and on the verge of an independent life) tends to want more expensive items. I absolutely understand integrating the kids into a new blended family but to call OP cruel and petty because brothers new wife seems to want in on free items is pretty thoughtless.", "The girl is new to OP and SIL just feels entitled to have the same for her daughter which is pretty entitled", "Except it's not the brother's child. If the brother has a divorce he has 0 rights to the kid. If the brother adopted the kid, then that would be a different story.", "I agree with you.", "100% this. Kids are family when parents marry in. They don\u2019t get to choose. Intentionally leaving them out is cruel. Make a new tradition that you feel good about so you can also bond with your new niece. I would have been horrified if my SIL treated my kids the way OP is talking about with their new niece. YTA OP because you really just don\u2019t want to be bothered.", "OP isn't TA; her response of SIL should pay was appropriate for the demand that OP spend a bunch of money on her kid", "You know that could end every badly right?", "You are very out touch", "It\u2019s out of touch to think everyone can afford not to count pennies.", "It\u2019s very entitled to think family owes you,  he made the  and she made hers. Also I have never seen a family where everyone is treated the same.", "Exactly. It's important to kids to have one on one time with adults, especially when it's a tradition.", "OP shouldn\u2019t have to start a new tradition. It\u2019s something special between OP and niece. What\u2019s the relationship there? Does OP interact with SN enough to warrant that or even like hanging out with the kid? It seems like SIL is trying to get free goods for her kid. \n\n\u201cUpset because I didn\u2019t ask my brother to pay\u201d get out of here \ud83d\ude44", "[removed]", "Or possibly start a different, but equal tradition with step niece. Step niece didn't ask to marry into the family either and is also learning to share. I'm sure seeing her new sister being spoiled for a day while she gets nothing sucks even more on top of everything else. \n\nOr talk to both girls and maybe find a solution together.", ">is probably less about turning down one trip and more that they openly say the stepdaughter isn't \"real family.\"\n\nI think it's more about mom being mad her daughter won't get free stuff from a stranger.", "SIL is assuming OP will spend on her daughter, who is new to OP as she does on a niece she has had a relationship with for 14 yrs.", "[removed]", "Yes its her step sister and OP\u2019s step niece.", "It\u2019s entitled to want a child to be included in family bonding?", "Signing a piece of paper doesn\u2019t make you automatically an integral part of a family, OP is not related to her and probably doesn\u2019t even really know her, it\u2019s only logical OP would prefer not to change a long-standing tradition for someone she doesn\u2019t even know properly.", "You're absolutely vile. I feel bad for the girl. A little kindness goes a long way.", "Your new niece is also your real niece. Ffs you\u2019re gross.", "I think people are unfair to expect you have the same relationship with what is to you a random 15 year old, that is in your life due to your brother marrying the kids mother. If they divorce them that relationship ends, however the relationship with the bio niece will always be their.", "She doesn\u2019t have to, but it would be nice if step niece would like to.", "That was my though exactly. OP has known the niece since birth. This is a 15-year-old kid that only recently came into the family so I really don't think OP has any obligation to try and create a new tradition with the girl. Would it be nice? Sure, but I doubt OP really has any relationship or bond with the brother's new step daughter at this point. Given that, it's kind of dumb to think that you can just force her to do things with the kid or include the kid in the long-standing tradition with the niece. \n\nI'm close to my brother's bio kids and his step kid, but I've also known the step kid for nearly 20 years old since he was a toddler when my brother and SIL married. If my brother divorced and remarried someone with a teenager, I highly doubt I'd ever have the same relationship with that kid as I do with the niblings whom I've known all their lives.", "Yep, \"step-niece\" is hardly a close relation. Sorry, OP's primary responsibility is to her own flesh and blood.", "It's basically free childcare despite the fact the kid is 15.", "It's pizza dude. Won't break the bank.", "yes, which i agree is not reasonable. the solution is to maintain this as a niece-aunt/uncle tradition and form some kind of bond with the step-daughter in some other way.", "It's not family bonding, it's OP bonding and spending money on a niece whose life she has been part of her whole life.\n\nSIL pushed back on being told she had to pay for shopping; that indicates she had an entitled view of becoming immediate family and having OP spend money on her daughter.", "There are children that are fully related to me that I don\u2019t consider real family since i do not know these people, could be the same.", "How is she? Not attacking you, just can\u2019t wrap my head around how she holds the same standing at all", "I agree with this completely, but relationships shouldn\u2019t be forced. Unfortunately OP didn\u2019t share what their relationship is like. Happy Ending Story, I would love to see an Update where OP and SN bond. \nI personally have a huge family. I only have a relationship with (my Fav) Cousin though. maybe SN has the same situation?", "15 yo don\u2019t need child care. This is about the tradition and the expense of an all day outing", "One is a niece since her birth, one is her brothers new stepdaughter.  Not quite the same.", ">They're both her nieces now\n\nNo, they're not. \n\n>Why should she treat them differently?\n\nBecause one is her niece whom she's always known and the other is a random kid whose mom married op's brother a few months ago. How could she treat them the same?? It's illogical to expect the same treatment.", "Yes, she could do a monthly pizza and movie night with both girls if her niece is interested. Otherwise just the new one.", "It\u2019s not entitled to want to see a child included. Children are people and they have feelings and it\u2019s not their choice to marry into family and should absolutely be included in activities. It\u2019s not unreasonable at all.", "If she was adopted vs a step child would you say the same thing?", "First, it's a one on one activity; second, SIL seems more interested in her daughter being included so OP spends money on her; 3rd, step niece has a family, there's no way they're going to include niece in activities they take step-niece for.", "Depends on what real means in this context.", "No. One is niece and the other is step niece she just met.", "Technically, I think the one would be called a step niece unless her brother actually adopted her. But obviously she should still be treated as a new niece and a member of the family.", "She wasn\u2019t adopted so let\u2019s just deal with the facts.", "But you\u2019re argument is based on being genetically linked.  When you marry someone with kids you\u2019re taking on a package deal.  Having your family treat them differently because they aren\u2019t \u201cbiologically related\u201d is not only cruel, but traumatic to the kid.", "You're delusional fam \ud83d\ude02. It's not the child fault but it certainly isn't OP's fault either that she literally just met her and has no prior relationship.", "Therefore mom should pay", "She\u2019s 15! And probably has a dad and a family on his side. I don\u2019t know about you, but when I was 15 I had no desire to join a whole new family - or spend time with my step-aunt or uncle, on my own. If my step-grandparents would have claimed or expected the same kind of loving relationship I had with my own grandparents it would have felt extremely contrived and awkward.", "Op didn\u2019t marry anyone! That\u2019s the point. Just because someone gets married and takes in step kids, doesn\u2019t mean their family has to rearrange their lives for the new kid. They didn\u2019t marry Into the situation!", "It's not traumatic ffs. My steodad was my stepdad since I was 6 years old and even as a child, I never expected his family to treat me as their relative. Didn't even want it. I have my own relatives, just because my mom has a new spouse doesn't mean that I magically have new relatives.\n\nIf my stepdad didn't treat me fairly, yeah that would be a whole different thing. But his brother? Oh hell no, he ain't my uncle.\n\nThe step niece is 15 entering this, not 1.", ">When you marry someone with kids you\u2019re taking on a package deal.\n\nYeah, the person marrying does. \n\n>Having your family treat them differently because they aren\u2019t \u201cbiologically related\u201d is not only cruel, but traumatic to the kid.\n\nOh ffs, no 15yo is gonna be traumatized that some random lady doesn't buy her clothes. I'm sure she has family", "| When YOU marry someone | \n\nthere, OP did not marry SIL, she has no obligation for step niece. However, she'll be a great human if she starts something for her too. It will be a great experience for the step niece plus her bio niece will also get a sister. She will learn family is not by blood, it's by hearts. \n\nNTA", "The downvotes on your comment are really amazing. This is exactly what blended families are. Step, adopted, the ones that just move in and never leave. And if you're truly family, everyone is loved equally.\n\nKeeping the tradition is important for the niece and a great idea. Making a new one or many new ones are also great ideas.", "Well said!", "Precisely! It shouldn\u2019t be OP\u2019s responsibility to provide for her sister in law\u2019s children that she had with someone else. People are bang out of order for saying OP is TA. Step niece is brother\u2019s responsibility not OP!"]}
