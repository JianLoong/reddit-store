They set a table for the kids and then the young adults and the elders. I sat with my cousins in the young adults group and I sat with my cousins and their grown up kids who are in their 20s. My cousins were talking about different stuff when one of them asked me what I've been up to. I told them that I've just been in school a lot and doing things and finally had sometime to come back home for the holidays and that it was a relief to escape Houston for a couple of weeks due to how humid it is down here. I'm stuck with college there for the next few years. Then one of my other cousins asked me \"Do you still work on youtube ?\" I said yes I still do. Then one of my other cousins butted in and said \"Why don't you just focus on your schooling instead of making these youtube content that no one watches ?\". Then they all laughed at me and I got upset so I walked out on them and slammed my aunt's glass screen so hard that it broke the spring thingy. My aunt and uncle kicked us out and told my parents to take me home so that I can calm down and stop acting like a child. My sister called me an asshole and said that I am so immature for my age. She told me that I shouldn't be acting like a child and having meltdowns when I am literally 28. I couldn't help it cause they upsetted me. I'm already dealing with people cyber bullying me already so it doesn't help me when people are attacking me. If they didn't want the glass door to break then they shouldn't have gotten me ticked off. I'm not paying for the screen door.
