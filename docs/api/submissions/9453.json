Your husband said she did not need to move out.  And she thinks (or says) she can't afford to live elsewhere, which you seem to reject out of hand.  Your next discussion should have been with your husband, not with her.  So now you've positioned yourself as the stepmom who's trying to give her the boot from \"her\" house.  So talk to your husband and figure out what the next step's going to be.  \n\nWord of advice, it will not be desirable to have the baby in your room for any length of time at all.  Even when the kid sleeps through the night (which won't be right away), the kid's still active and making noise.

She's only 23 and it's expensive and hard AF to move out on your own right now. I know people double her age that are having issues. You're basically kicking her out to make room for YOUR baby...both you and her father are TA. My heart breaks for this girl.", "Info: what\u2019s her salary like, are you in a HCOL area, etc?\n\nThe housing market is rough right now to save the least and it would be shitty of you to kick her out if she genuinely can\u2019t afford to live on her own.

You need to discuss with your husband period get aligned and he have the discussion.   Especially as you said you are not close with hers.\n\nYou deliberately left huge amount of details.  How long have you been married,  how long have you lived together, was daughter living their before, how is the mortgage joint,  is the daughter paying rent etc etc.", "NAH \n\nYour adult step-daughter moving out is a perfectly reasonable solution to the problem at hand.

You convinced him to tell his daughter she needs to move out, but then in private he took it back and told her she did not have to leave. So then, you decided it was OK to go behind his back when you again chose to bring this up with your stepdaughter. Is your plan to basically shame her until she leaves?\n\nOf course she is upset. She\u2019s scared that her stepmom will convince her Dad to kick her out at a time that inflation and cost of living are through the roof, and her Dad is being wishy-washy and not clearly setting boundaries and expectations for her.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting you don\u2019t mention your husband' age or whether you financially contribute to the household. But look. You are the second wife. He had a family before you. You can\u2019t make unilateral decisions just because you decided he needs to put his \u201cnew\u201d family 100% ahead of his old one.

Basement?", "YTA and also why do women keep shacking up with men who have daughters close to their age?", "NAH. Your concerns about space are reasonable and stepdaughter is a young adult. But many young folks are staying at home longer - partially due to being unable to afford their own space, like your stepdaughter, and getting a roommate that's a stranger is a scary prospect for a lot of people. \n\nShe is also likely feeling replaced by the new baby. Dad has a new wife and new kid and suddenly there's no room for her anymore. Most kids still expect to have a room at their parents' after they move out, at least for a while. It sounds like you're planning to clear out her space for the baby - which leaves her without a safety net to come home to.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you were ill intentioned, but I'm not sure shoving stepdaughter out the door is the solution.", "NAH even tho you raw dogged it without the room available for the result.  Sounds like you married an older man without the accompanying bank account, with no real assets brought to the marriage by you, even at your age, so I feel sorry for your short-sightedness.  You'll be fine with the infant in your room for the next 2 years.  I don't know if you noticed, but a lot of kids are staying home with their parents much longer because they can't afford to live.  I told my son-in-law who lives with me rent free, people can afford a car payment, or housing payment, but not both in this market.  One or both are gonna give somewhere.  You're VERY short-sighted.  I gave my judgment, but I'm totally team SD.", "INFO how old is your husband?", "NAH tending towards NTA, \n\n  \nSounds like a tough situation. You need that space for the coming baby on one hand, but on the other hand it sounds like your step-daughter isn't able to fully support herself if she moves out.\n\nThe reason why I'm tending towards NTA is the extensive help you have offered her, while she acted immaturely instead of talking it out and voicing her concerns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of paying for the first 2 months maybe pay for a portion of the cost for the apartment, so she has less monthly burden? Also a roommate is always a good option to reduce costs (as already proposed by you). She will have to move out at some point anyways, it's a part of growing up and becoming independent.", "\"Oi, time for you to fuck off, off you pop, your replacement will be here soon and despite the fact that for the first 6 months they don't need an entire room, you need to go now even though there's a cost of living crisis etc. Don't care and I'll keep raising it with you.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou know that she's not super close with you for a reason, don't you, and that you're also replacing her - even if you're not, it does look that way, even to an adult?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou made a decision to have a child despite not being in the financial situation to house that child without turfing someone else out to make room. She's going to absolutely loathe you if you push this you understand? And she'll likely be fine with her father ... until he potentially also realises it was a shitty move and based on you bringing a life into the world you couldn't fully fund or house?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShe told her dad privately because she doesn't like you, or trust you, and you only further cemented that by bringing it up. The smarmy \"But we'll help you decorate and help with some rent!\" doesn't really help when, after two months, her wages don't enable her to keep the place. But by that point you won't give a shit, right, because *new baby* and you got your way?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYTA. You can either accept that and push and push and alienate her, deprive the baby of an older sister and ultiamtely alienate the father or, just an idea, find a bigger place where she can continue to live with you WHILST paying a rent so it's affordable. Or maybe plan your family better next time before getting pregnant and THEN thinking \"Oh shit, where's it going to stay, whoops, looks like your kids on the bounce!\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe average age to leave home isn't 18 now or even 25. Most young people cannot afford to leave home and don't particularly want to live with strangers weirdly. And no, I'm older than you, but apparently not quite so callous.

Completely unsurprising that a full-time (presumably entry-level for a 20something) job cannot cover expenses.\n\nEdit: Grammar", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you plan for this before you decided to have a baby in a home that doesn\u2019t have space for a baby?", "YTA. Your concerns are understandable, and you started this okay, but its the second attempt you made after the first no. Your not her mother. And from the sounds of it you have no interest in her being a part of your family.", "Yta. Ewe, ewe, ewe\u2026 you sound like a selfish woman. Who moves in and tries to kick her new \u201cdaughter \u201c out of her room for a baby. Of course she can\u2019t afford to move. You sound like a gold digger to me.", "YTA.

It\u2019s not easy to live alone so springing it on her is not fair but it\u2019s also not unreasonable to what space for your baby. Can you not afford a bigger space?", "Of course she's upset -- you're essentially kicking her out of her home, no matter how you dress it up with offers to help her decorate.  Did you just assume that your stepdaughter would be happy to move out? She probably also has all sorts of feelings about getting a new half-sibling and now you're telling her she has to leave her home.\n\nI get where you're coming from and I can see that this makes you unhappy. I'm going with NAH but I really think there were some different choices you and your husband could have made here.", "YTA insensitive, non-empathetic and selfish . Your baby will stay in your room for the first 4-6 months of their life anyway so maybe give her the chance to bond with her new sibling and possibly HELP you out a bit through sleepless nights. Did you stop to think about the positives of her being there instead of the negatives ? If you two  can\u2019t  afford a bigger home what makes you think she can afford a place on her own ? Let\u2019s be realistic and sensible here.", "Do you rent or own?\n\nIf you rent, how much more would it be for a 3 bedroom?\n\nMaybe she could pay the difference?", "YTA. You don't get to kick out a child so you can replace them with another one. How are you about to be a parent and contemplating this???", "info: Did she live there before you moved in? If so what discussions did you and your husband have around that ?", "NTA and YTA. You\u2019re not the asshole for wanting her to move out. You are the asshole for bringing it up with her after her dad told her she could stay. You should have had another talk with your husband to figure out what you guys can do to come to a solution. Instead of paying two months rent can you pay part of her rent every month?  Or maybe all of you move into a three bedroom place and she pays part of the rent and utilities. Once you guys had figure out some ideas that were feasible then both of you should have asked her when she could sit down with you for a chat about how to work out future housing.  If she likes the idea of all of you moving to a bigger place then have her work out how much she can afford for rent and then figure out your budget for a new place, knowing that you guys may have to subsidize her to get a place you want. Although she shouldn\u2019t be asked to pay more than 1/4 of the rent as they\u2019ll soon be four of you and you\u2019ll have the baby in the third bedroom.  If she doesn\u2019t like that idea maybe you guys say that they baby can stay in your room for it\u2019s first year (realistically probably longer) so she doesn\u2019t have to move out immediately but can save money for the rest of your pregnancy and that year then find a place she can afford. It also gives her time to work on getting promoted (hopefully her job has upward mobility), find a second job, find a roommate, or maybe she\u2019ll get involved with someone and they decide to get a place together.  You and your husband are a team so you need to figure what you guys can contribute financially, logically, etc. Then you all need to sit down as a family to figure out what works for all of you. You also need to apologize to her for trying to push her out after she\u2019d been told she can\u2019t stay and you need to apologize to your husband for not presenting a united front/crossing boundaries by countermanding what he told his daughter. You need to acknowledge to both of them that it really wasn\u2019t your place to say what you did, especially without your husband\u2019s backing.", "NTA I think it's ok to ask, especially because you aren't just throwing her out. You're willing to help financially and to help with finding a roommate if need be.\n\nMoving out is a big step, so it's normal for her to have a lot of feels about it. What would hold her back from being ok with having a roommate?", "NTA. You offered to help find her a roommate. T he fact that she ran off to her room (this is a 23 year old adult, not a child) when you offered to help sort out expenses shows that she isn\u2019t serious about even trying and just wants to live rent free. She isn\u2019t owed a free place to live for the rest of her life.", "NAH. What is she doing to improve her chances of leaving? This is a 23 yr old, not a child. Is she taking any classes for a degree or a certificate? You say she works full time but where? Can you say hey live rent free for the next 6 months but than ya gotta go. That\u2019s plenty of time to save up and find a roommate if need be.", "NAH\n\nThis is a tough spot.  The reality is that cost of living is high and despite that housing is still in high demand.  That means finding a place is going to be hard no matter what.  Your frustration is understandable, but you need to realize that Stepdaughter is functionally in the same boat as you with not being able to afford another place.  I'm sure a 23-year-old doesn't want to live with a newborn, but I think she realizes that she doesn't have another option right now.\n\nTensions are high and the best thing I think you can do is sit both husband and step daughter down and tell them that your sorry if your request stirred up tention but if your all going to fo forward you need to pull together.  There's about to be a fourth person in that house with you and it's only going to get more stressful.\n\nAnd before anyone says \"Why should OP have to apologize?!\" Because sometimes the first step of conflict resolution is extending the olive branch.", "YTA.  Are you completely ignorant to the cost of living crisis right now?  Two months rent won\u2019t help anything in the long run if her salary doesn\u2019t exceed her living expenses. If you\u2019re in the US, 56% of adults ages 18-24 currently live with their parents. This is up from 52% in 2020 so it\u2019s only getting worse. If she says she can\u2019t afford to move out, she\u2019s most likely not lying.  You\u2019re extremely out of touch for someone only ten years older than her. Of course her father isn\u2019t going to kick her to the curb in the middle of a housing epidemic. \n\nYou should stop focusing on kicking her out and start focusing on how you can make your house fit your needs.  Is there an additional area in the home that can be converted into a bedroom?  If you can afford a new home, can you afford an addition?", "YTA. You\u2019re not thinking about how difficult it will be for her on her own.\n\nYou also went behind your husbands back and tried again after your husband said it was ok.\n \nLeave her alone and let the baby sleep in the room with you.\n\nParents sleep with their kids all the time. IMO its actually safest and more convenient.\n\nBtw who\u2019s house is it ? if it was his first before you came along, that means you\u2019re trying to kick his daughter out her own home for your baby.", "NTA. She is an adult, yes prices have gotten more expensive yet that does not mean all adult childern live with parents. She can live with roommates like most Adults her age. If she isn't already she should be paying you guys rent too at that age.", "YTA.

Would you be acting sweet as pie in this situation?", "This is a great question/thought.  Will be stalking for OPs response", "But will they qualify for the mortgage?

After that they can be moved. There are of course exceptions like parents such light sleepers that baby sleeping noises keep them up so they choose to move the baby to their own room early.  \n\nSo the baby doesn\u2019t NEED their own room right away but it\u2019s also much easier to prepare the nursery before you have the baby so it\u2019s all set up when you need it.

He absolutely can\u2019t be in the room with us if any of us want to sleep.", "Ok so for the sake of argument, if OP gave the daughter a timeline and said she didn\u2019t need to move out until the baby was 6 months old, would she still be an asshole?", "Came here to say exactly this.  Baby should be in parents\u2019 room for at least the first six months.", "We know that they are offering to help her financially and to find a roommate. I do think they should give her 6 months to move. Baby can stay in their room for the first 6-12 months", "who said a woman in her 30s is considered young?  the comment to which you replied says that old men should stop chasing young girls.  it happens\u2026 a lot.\n\nwho said those women are unable to make their own decisions?  they can, but\u2026 do you actually know the circumstances of their decisions?  who\u2019s to say they weren\u2019t love-bombed or manipulated (as is often the case in age-gap relationships)?\n\ngrooming can literally happen to anyone of any age or any gender.\n\nsee: the victims of keith raniere; the victims of larry ray; etc\u2026", "Thank you. Totally agreed. Why are people so fucking disgusted by this. It's completely fine", "Would this not make  OP's husband TA? They discussed it and agreed step daughter would move out.

They were on the same page and then he flipped and from the info we have never took the time to discuss with his wife before telling his daughter she could stay.", "OP kept pushing because she is the only one thinking logically.\n\nWhen will the step daughter move out? When she\u2019s 25?28?30? \nIs her own child supposed to sleep under the stairs until she\u2019s 5? Or in her parents room?\nJust so the adult can live rent free at her parents house?\n\nAlso, OP has a say on who stays at her house or who doesn\u2019t\u2026 as it\u2019s not only her husbands but also her space. So both of them have just as much of a say. If it\u2019s a yes/ no situation there needs to be a compromise, no one overrules the other here.", "I think \"pushing\" is a strong word choice. She made a decision to revisit it with the step-daughter because she thought it appropriate to do so as it is her marital home and she has input on the goings on there and in the say of her step-children as the husband has made a commitment to such by getting married to her.\n\nI don't think she intentionally meant to hurt the daughter but did and I think the dad acted to defend his daughter, which is fine as well. I don't think there is any \"fault\" here.\n\nDo think she should try to heal any wounds with the daughter but also the daughter will need to start looking to start her own life sans parents or possibly start contributing to household expenses to look for a larger place if they all are agreeable.", "I mean, they can *definitely* afford a 2 bedroom\u2026", "You\u2019re ignoring the part where OP tried to help her find a roommate to make it affordable, and the daughter wouldn\u2019t even entertain the idea.", "A 40 year old is definitely mature enough to decide they want to be with someone who is 66. The problem with the age gap is when it's someone who is just barely an adult/still going through formative years (early 20s) with someone who is through that point of their life (early 30s). An 18 and 28 year old is disgusting. A 28 year old and a 38 year old, not so much", "Yeah I am, and I wish someone would offer to pay 2 months of rent, budget, buy furniture & decorations, and find a roommate and affordable flat share for me!         \n\nThey've been trying to compromise or find solutions with stepdaughter.. what is her plan? To freeload off them forever?          \nA new baby is on the way, it sucks, but sooner or later stepdaughter needs to move out, if not now then surely before that child is a toddler.       \nThe fact she's storming off and slamming doors, and refusing to even discuss a compromise suggests there's some BIIIIG underlying immaturity issues here that OP hasn't mentioned.        \nTime to face the music and make a plan. Not everyone can afford to house their adult children indefinitely, she should consider it a privilege she got to 23 before being asked to be independent, and even then with a massive amount of support on offer to help her settle into it.", "1) I am not American 2)Where is step-daughters consideration of her family? 3) They have been having conversations with the daughter and trying to find possible solutions 4) a grown-ass 23 y/o should be able to afford an apt with a roommate. It is almost impossible that she doesn\u2019t make enough money to share an apartment. It\u2019s just easier for her to inconvenience others to make her own life easier.

My point is that sticking a baby in a crib isn\u2019t the end of the space a baby takes up.", "You need a stroller. You need a crib. You need a place to keep their clothing, diaper supply and changing area. God forbid you want them to have some toys & books too and get accused of clout chasing lmao.", "At what point is the daughter old enough to be expected to take care of herself financially? 23 is an adult, which makes it HER responsibility to he financially stable, not OP.", "Why do people keep saying OP decided to bring a child into the world? Why is the dad given a pass? OP didn't make that baby alone.", "Eh are they American? Are they in a place with a high cost of living? We don\u2019t know lol", "It literally is the whole point and the catalyst for this entire conflict. \n\nThere\u2019s a new baby coming soon along with all the things new babies bring. \n\nSo if you think the daughter gets to stay indefinitely, where does the new baby go? Are the baby and the daughter going to share a room?", "People here are acting like its insane to expect a 23 year old to even consider moving out of their parents house", "She's an adult, we literally all have to accept that at her age.", "\u201cwhy haven\u2019t you talked to us or spend time with us?\u201d type of victim complex", "No theirs a difference between giving her time to find a place and just throwing her out for the new baby", "If you wanna fuck someone who's (at a minimum) a decade younger than you, fine, but you can't get mad at people pointing out your predatory behaviors.", "Depending on whether or not OP got the information that the daughter could stay and *then kept* pressing he very well could be.", "And you're ignoring the part where OP is willing to push any stranger on the step daughter to get her out of the house.", "1) good for you buddy 2) OP has left out the stepdaughter's circumstances, whether she pays rent, if she offered to help with the baby or store baby stuff in her room or whatever. Why do you assume the daughter isn't pulling her weight without evidence?  3) They said get out, this is what we will give you. I think the conversation needs to be what financial situation will allow the stepdaughter to move out sustainably so she is not evicted by her landlord? Even if they are paying two months rent, many landlords will not rent to you if your income isn't X times rent. 4) As people have mentioned above, she may have received a predatory education loan, may be in medical debt, may be working a minimum wage job or may be like the literal majority of young adults in the US who cannot afford to live outside the parental home. Why are you so eager to assume the worst of her? We haven't heard that she spends her income on alcohol/drugs or that she can't hold down a job or that she is slacking in some way", "Wow. Tell us you're out of touch some more.", "When she financially can. Which potentially is never. Parenting is forever. These 2 adults got pregnant without enough space in their home to accomodate their family. Now, the stepmother is using it as an excuse to terf the other one out. She has had no warning, no preparation. We don\u2019t know what the other convos have been like - perhaps dad said she can stay forever and now it\u2019s suddenly changed up. Perhaps she is not well or cannot work consistently. We probably have an unreliable narrator", "You are completely missing the point. \n\nHer husband, the father to the 23yo, is okay with his daughter living there.\n\nOP brought nothing to the marriage, knew she was moving into a 2 bedroom house, and still decided to get pregnant. \n\nThe housing market is in shambles, the 23yo can't control that.\n\n\nInflation is ravaging middle-class people around the globe, the 23yo can't control that.\n\n\nAs I said the baby who isn't even in this world yet will stay with its parents in their room for 1 to 2 years, instead of trying to force her husband's daughter out at THIS time she should back off and set an effing time line for this BUT no she wants it her way right effing now and she keeps pushing it.", "Because OP is the one trying to kick the stepdaughter out while the dad said she can stay. Also OP is the one who asked for judgment, so people will word their responses at her.", "so the grown 33yo and husband can\u2019t afford a bigger house but the 23yo has to?\n\nthey decided to be pregnant before thinking about where the baby would go- thats on them\nto deal with now", "Again. She's 23. Not 40. Possibly still in school and the ONLY reason she's being bullied by her stepmother is make room for a new family. Just because someone is 18 doesn't mean to are supposed to stop giving a shit.", "Right? I know it's hard for young adults. It's always been hard for them, and it's certainly even harder now, but 23 is definitely a young adult who is old enough to be done with undergraduate degree (and really even wrapping up a masters) ... time to put on the big boy pants and get an apartment.", "she never once said she was going to kick her out\u2026she was trying to find a roommate and go shopping for stuff for the apartment\u2026that\u2019s not even remotely the same as being kicked out of the door with no notice", "I feel like the continued pressure from op and the one sided decision making of the husband makes them both TA. Without more info it's hard to say whether or not the step daughter just doesn't want a roommate and is manipulative but I lean toward her being the victim in the middle of the confusion.", "You\u2019re describing getting a roommate like it\u2019s not a standard part of being a young adult and moving out lmao", "I\u2019m basing my judgement on what OP wrote. I\u2019m not making up scenarios about step-daughter. Even if she has predatory loans, even if she has a min-wage job, she can still move out. That\u2019s what most young adults go through. That\u2019s how you learn to be a responsible member of society that is able to take care of themselves.", "Honestly, tell me ONE single job, that doesn\u2019t allow someone to rent a shared apartment. Just ONE. I live in Manhattan, a 1BR is 4-5k a month but if you move to one of the boroughs you can get a shared apt for maybe $600-700pp. Sure, it\u2019s far, that\u2019s also $700 less you get to spend on yourself but that is being an adult! My cleaning lady, has roommates, my doorman has roommates. It\u2019s absolutely doable. It\u2019s just not as convenient as getting to spend all your money on yourself by inconveniencing others.", "You realize as a married couple both partners have a say in what goes in their housing situation, yes? You also realize that her husband was just as much of a factor in having a new child as OP? The husband is TA for going behind his wife\u2019s back and telling his 23 year old daughter she can continue living there when he knows it will be infeasible when the new child is old enough to get their own room.", "The 23year old doesn\u2019t need to afford a 2 bedroom apartment lol \n\nThey need a roommate situation.", "Still kinda shitty op is ready to replace her step daughter for her bio daughter. Kids don\u2019t even really sleep i their own room intil they are close to one. The first few months they have to be fed e every two hours. Also who knows if the step daughter is even comfortable living with a stranger. Make it sound as fun as you want but op is ready to kick her out for the new baby.", "It\u2019s not a replacement, but a newborn needs their parents more than an adult child. I feel like that\u2019s super common sense.", "She\u2019s not being replaced, she is a whole ass adult who shouldn\u2019t expect to live rent free for an indefinite amount of time. \n\nYes, a 23 year old adult is being asked to move out because a newborn baby is on the way\u2026only reddit could spin that as being wrong lmfao", "That\u2019s not true. Mine got moved to their bedrooms at 5months old and 4 months old. They knew how to roll in all directions by then, and did not sleep well near us due to our sleep sounds\u2026\n\nWe were all miserable, waking up hourly, sometimes more. Everyone instantly slept better when they went to their rooms.\n\nI don\u2019t think *replace* is the right word. The parents have an obligation to support their minor children.\n\nAn adult child in their 20\u2019s, with a full time job, living in a 2-bedroom should *not* be shocked to find out the parents need space for the baby on the way.", "This is simply not true about children not sleeping in their own room until 1. That may be what you or some people you know did but it certainly is not the only way. That is why they have baby monitor and video monitors...to monitor children in their own room, well before age 1.", "Ehh I disagree. Step-daughter has a full time job and is an adult. Op offered to cover 2 months of rent to help get her started on her feet. Unless there are undisclosed expenses/circumstances then the step daughter should be perfectly capable of moving in with a roommate who crazy thought here; doesn't need to be a stranger.\n\nWe don't know how much spaceop is working with and whether or not 4 people could actually cohabitate where they are. You are dying on a hill when we don't have enough info to substantiate any of your claims.\n\nDoes the step daughter contribute to the house in any way? Is the home big enough to fit 3 adults and an infant? If the step daughter contributed money would they be able to afford a bigger house? Those are just a few examples of information we're missing that would really help paint the image."]}
