So talk to your husband and figure out what the next step's going to be.  \n\nWord of advice, it will not be desirable to have the baby in your room for any length of time at all.  Even when the kid sleeps through the night (which won't be right away), the kid's still active and making noise.

She's only 23 and it's expensive and hard AF to move out on your own right now. I know people double her age that are having issues. You're basically kicking her out to make room for YOUR baby...both you and her father are TA. My heart breaks for this girl.", "Info: what\u2019s her salary like, are you in a HCOL area, etc?\n\nThe housing market is rough right now to save the least and it would be shitty of you to kick her out if she genuinely can\u2019t afford to live on her own.

You convinced him to tell his daughter she needs to move out, but then in private he took it back and told her she did not have to leave. So then, you decided it was OK to go behind his back when you again chose to bring this up with your stepdaughter. Is your plan to basically shame her until she leaves?\n\nOf course she is upset. She\u2019s scared that her stepmom will convince her Dad to kick her out at a time that inflation and cost of living are through the roof, and her Dad is being wishy-washy and not clearly setting boundaries and expectations for her.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting you don\u2019t mention your husband' age or whether you financially contribute to the household. But look. You are the second wife. He had a family before you. You can\u2019t make unilateral decisions just because you decided he needs to put his \u201cnew\u201d family 100% ahead of his old one.

Basement?", "YTA and also why do women keep shacking up with men who have daughters close to their age?", "NAH. Your concerns about space are reasonable and stepdaughter is a young adult. But many young folks are staying at home longer - partially due to being unable to afford their own space, like your stepdaughter, and getting a roommate that's a stranger is a scary prospect for a lot of people. \n\nShe is also likely feeling replaced by the new baby. Dad has a new wife and new kid and suddenly there's no room for her anymore. Most kids still expect to have a room at their parents' after they move out, at least for a while. It sounds like you're planning to clear out her space for the baby - which leaves her without a safety net to come home to.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you were ill intentioned, but I'm not sure shoving stepdaughter out the door is the solution.", "NAH even tho you raw dogged it without the room available for the result.  Sounds like you married an older man without the accompanying bank account, with no real assets brought to the marriage by you, even at your age, so I feel sorry for your short-sightedness.  You'll be fine with the infant in your room for the next 2 years.  I don't know if you noticed, but a lot of kids are staying home with their parents much longer because they can't afford to live.  I told my son-in-law who lives with me rent free, people can afford a car payment, or housing payment, but not both in this market.  One or both are gonna give somewhere.  You're VERY short-sighted.  I gave my judgment, but I'm totally team SD.", "INFO how old is your husband?", "NAH tending towards NTA, \n\n  \nSounds like a tough situation. You need that space for the coming baby on one hand, but on the other hand it sounds like your step-daughter isn't able to fully support herself if she moves out.\n\nThe reason why I'm tending towards NTA is the extensive help you have offered her, while she acted immaturely instead of talking it out and voicing her concerns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of paying for the first 2 months maybe pay for a portion of the cost for the apartment, so she has less monthly burden? Also a roommate is always a good option to reduce costs (as already proposed by you). She will have to move out at some point anyways, it's a part of growing up and becoming independent.", "\"Oi, time for you to fuck off, off you pop, your replacement will be here soon and despite the fact that for the first 6 months they don't need an entire room, you need to go now even though there's a cost of living crisis etc. Don't care and I'll keep raising it with you.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou know that she's not super close with you for a reason, don't you, and that you're also replacing her - even if you're not, it does look that way, even to an adult?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou made a decision to have a child despite not being in the financial situation to house that child without turfing someone else out to make room. She's going to absolutely loathe you if you push this you understand? And she'll likely be fine with her father ... until he potentially also realises it was a shitty move and based on you bringing a life into the world you couldn't fully fund or house?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShe told her dad privately because she doesn't like you, or trust you, and you only further cemented that by bringing it up. The smarmy \"But we'll help you decorate and help with some rent!\" doesn't really help when, after two months, her wages don't enable her to keep the place. But by that point you won't give a shit, right, because *new baby* and you got your way?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYTA. You can either accept that and push and push and alienate her, deprive the baby of an older sister and ultiamtely alienate the father or, just an idea, find a bigger place where she can continue to live with you WHILST paying a rent so it's affordable. Or maybe plan your family better next time before getting pregnant and THEN thinking \"Oh shit, where's it going to stay, whoops, looks like your kids on the bounce!\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe average age to leave home isn't 18 now or even 25. Most young people cannot afford to leave home and don't particularly want to live with strangers weirdly. And no, I'm older than you, but apparently not quite so callous.

You are being unrealistic about decorating a new place.  Leave the discussions with her to your husband.", "YTA.\n\nYou're barely a decade older than your step-daughter, leave her parenting to her actual parent.\n\nSecondly, yes she's behaving badly towards you; you're trying to kick her out of her home.\n\nThirdly, have you any idea of the economic fuckery going on in the world today? Completely unsurprising that a full-time (presumably entry-level for a 20something) job cannot cover expenses.\n\nEdit: Grammar", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you plan for this before you decided to have a baby in a home that doesn\u2019t have space for a baby?", "YTA. Your concerns are understandable, and you started this okay, but its the second attempt you made after the first no. Your not her mother. And from the sounds of it you have no interest in her being a part of your family.", "Yta. Ewe, ewe, ewe\u2026 you sound like a selfish woman. Who moves in and tries to kick her new \u201cdaughter \u201c out of her room for a baby. Of course she can\u2019t afford to move. You sound like a gold digger to me.", "YTA. You shouldn't have brought it up again.", "NTA\n\nOnce baby is a few months old is she willing to share a room or is she expecting you to keep baby in with you forever?", "ESH because you should have had this discussion a long time ago when you first got pregnant. It\u2019s not easy to live alone so springing it on her is not fair but it\u2019s also not unreasonable to what space for your baby. Can you not afford a bigger space?", "Of course she's upset -- you're essentially kicking her out of her home, no matter how you dress it up with offers to help her decorate.  Did you just assume that your stepdaughter would be happy to move out? She probably also has all sorts of feelings about getting a new half-sibling and now you're telling her she has to leave her home.\n\nI get where you're coming from and I can see that this makes you unhappy. I'm going with NAH but I really think there were some different choices you and your husband could have made here.", "YTA insensitive, non-empathetic and selfish . Your baby will stay in your room for the first 4-6 months of their life anyway so maybe give her the chance to bond with her new sibling and possibly HELP you out a bit through sleepless nights. Did you stop to think about the positives of her being there instead of the negatives ? If you two  can\u2019t  afford a bigger home what makes you think she can afford a place on her own ? Let\u2019s be realistic and sensible here.", "Do you rent or own?\n\nIf you rent, how much more would it be for a 3 bedroom?\n\nMaybe she could pay the difference?", "YTA. You don't get to kick out a child so you can replace them with another one. How are you about to be a parent and contemplating this???", "info: Did she live there before you moved in? If so what discussions did you and your husband have around that ?", "NTA and YTA. You\u2019re not the asshole for wanting her to move out. You are the asshole for bringing it up with her after her dad told her she could stay. You should have had another talk with your husband to figure out what you guys can do to come to a solution. Instead of paying two months rent can you pay part of her rent every month?  Or maybe all of you move into a three bedroom place and she pays part of the rent and utilities. Once you guys had figure out some ideas that were feasible then both of you should have asked her when she could sit down with you for a chat about how to work out future housing.  If she likes the idea of all of you moving to a bigger place then have her work out how much she can afford for rent and then figure out your budget for a new place, knowing that you guys may have to subsidize her to get a place you want. Although she shouldn\u2019t be asked to pay more than 1/4 of the rent as they\u2019ll soon be four of you and you\u2019ll have the baby in the third bedroom.  If she doesn\u2019t like that idea maybe you guys say that they baby can stay in your room for it\u2019s first year (realistically probably longer) so she doesn\u2019t have to move out immediately but can save money for the rest of your pregnancy and that year then find a place she can afford. It also gives her time to work on getting promoted (hopefully her job has upward mobility), find a second job, find a roommate, or maybe she\u2019ll get involved with someone and they decide to get a place together.  You and your husband are a team so you need to figure what you guys can contribute financially, logically, etc. Then you all need to sit down as a family to figure out what works for all of you. You also need to apologize to her for trying to push her out after she\u2019d been told she can\u2019t stay and you need to apologize to your husband for not presenting a united front/crossing boundaries by countermanding what he told his daughter. You need to acknowledge to both of them that it really wasn\u2019t your place to say what you did, especially without your husband\u2019s backing.", "NTA I think it's ok to ask, especially because you aren't just throwing her out. You're willing to help financially and to help with finding a roommate if need be.\n\nMoving out is a big step, so it's normal for her to have a lot of feels about it. What would hold her back from being ok with having a roommate?", "NTA. You offered to help find her a roommate. The fact that she ran off to her room (this is a 23 year old adult, not a child) when you offered to help sort out expenses shows that she isn\u2019t serious about even trying and just wants to live rent free. She isn\u2019t owed a free place to live for the rest of her life.", "NAH. What is she doing to improve her chances of leaving? This is a 23 yr old, not a child. Is she taking any classes for a degree or a certificate? You say she works full time but where? Can you say hey live rent free for the next 6 months but than ya gotta go. That\u2019s plenty of time to save up and find a roommate if need be.", "NAH\n\nThis is a tough spot.  The reality is that cost of living is high and despite that housing is still in high demand.  That means finding a place is going to be hard no matter what.  Your frustration is understandable, but you need to realize that Stepdaughter is functionally in the same boat as you with not being able to afford another place.  I'm sure a 23-year-old doesn't want to live with a newborn, but I think she realizes that she doesn't have another option right now.\n\nTensions are high and the best thing I think you can do is sit both husband and step daughter down and tell them that your sorry if your request stirred up tention but if your all going to fo forward you need to pull together.  There's about to be a fourth person in that house with you and it's only going to get more stressful.\n\nAnd before anyone says \"Why should OP have to apologize?!\" Because sometimes the first step of conflict resolution is extending the olive branch.", "YTA.  Are you completely ignorant to the cost of living crisis right now?  Two months rent won\u2019t help anything in the long run if her salary doesn\u2019t exceed her living expenses. If you\u2019re in the US, 56% of adults ages 18-24 currently live with their parents. This is up from 52% in 2020 so it\u2019s only getting worse. If she says she can\u2019t afford to move out, she\u2019s most likely not lying.  You\u2019re extremely out of touch for someone only ten years older than her. Of course her father isn\u2019t going to kick her to the curb in the middle of a housing epidemic. \n\nYou should stop focusing on kicking her out and start focusing on how you can make your house fit your needs.  Is there an additional area in the home that can be converted into a bedroom?  If you can afford a new home, can you afford an addition?", "YTA. You\u2019re not thinking about how difficult it will be for her on her own.\n\nYou also went behind your husbands back and tried again after your husband said it was ok.\n \nLeave her alone and let the baby sleep in the room with you.\n\nParents sleep with their kids all the time. IMO its actually safest and more convenient.\n\nBtw who\u2019s house is it ? if it was his first before you came along, that means you\u2019re trying to kick his daughter out her own home for your baby.", "NTA. She is an adult, yes prices have gotten more expensive yet that does not mean all adult childern live with parents. She can live with roommates like most Adults her age. If she isn't already she should be paying you guys rent too at that age.", "YTA.

Would you be acting sweet as pie in this situation?", "This is a great question/thought.  Will be stalking for OPs response", "But will they qualify for the mortgage? You're not wrong about it making a difference for being able to pay the bills, but I know a lot of banks are pretty strict about what you can count as income and how you can prove it when you apply.", "> But it\u2019s time for her to leave the nest.\n\nBe removed from her home by a woman merely 10 years older than her do she can be replaced as her father's child.", "She says it's a 2BR.", "I would like to know how old the Dad is.

After that they can be moved. There are of course exceptions like parents such light sleepers that baby sleeping noises keep them up so they choose to move the baby to their own room early.  \n\nSo the baby doesn\u2019t NEED their own room right away but it\u2019s also much easier to prepare the nursery before you have the baby so it\u2019s all set up when you need it. Plus you need somewhere to put all their stuff.", "we all sleep better with baby in our room!! every family is different. it will be challenging finding space for all baby stuff though.

Not a stepmom who is 10 years older than she is.", "Why did you add the \u201cinfo\u201d when you weren\u2019t requesting new info and just reiterating what has already been said.

The main issue is that no one is having an empathetic and appropriate conversation, though. \n\nHonestly, set the baby up in the shared living areas and see how quickly Dad and SD are suddenly both eager to find a solution since no one wants to converse like adults about things now. Most young adults now have roommates and I\u2019m sure SD will be much more open to that soon when a newborn enters the picture.", "It\u2019s WILD to me that I had to scroll so far to find the NTA votes.

But the reason it's morally weird is because it implies that the only reason the 40 year old isn't dating younger has nothing to do about the *morality* of dating younger, but simply the legality (of which the legal definition is simply a convenient way to legally approximate physical biology. The half plus seven rule has less to do about the actual numeric value of the years, and more about what those years represent in terms of life experience and emotional development.\n\nThe reason people always get up in arms about age gaps is because they essentially see the older person, being theoretically older and more world-travelled, as wanting to place themselves in a power dynamic where (as the theoretically wiser person) they are in a higher position of power - whereas by comparison the younger has less of that power. In a world moving towards equity any sort of power balance is seen as bad.\n\nBut of course these very same people fail to appreciate free will and personal discretion. *If* an 18yo is unusually mature for their age, and has the emotional development of a 60yo, and *if* there's the implicit understanding that they have the free will to walk away at any time, then I suppose it's okay for them to date somebody significantly older than them.

When I (52f) married my husband (48m) 23 years ago, I had two boys already and we had a 3 bedroom house. We were both at the beginning of our careers, not making a ton of money. We knew we wanted to have kids together but we waited several years. In that time my husband bonded with my boys and became closer to them than I could have imagined. He loved them like he would his own children, even though they were with their dad half the time, but he left discipline and big decisions about their life up to me and their father. Of course we listened to any opinion he might have had.\n\nWe had our first child together when I was in my mid- 30\u2019s and our last one 17 months later. By that time, we were more stable, everyone had plenty of room and my husband had established trust with my kids. When the two other kids were born, we were just a bigger family. \n\nAnd one last thing, I don\u2019t care if my kids are 23 or 53, life is hard people! If any of my kids ever need to come back home to get on their feet financially, emotionally, physically or mentally, our door will always be open and they\u2019ll always have a place to lay their head. We all need a little help sometimes, especially with the world and economy the way it is right now.

I have 2 young adult children. Neither were kicked out. Once high school was over, they were given options: go to college and live at home rent-free, get a job and move out or get a job, live at home but contribute to the household. Both children CHOSE to move on their own, one with a roommate and one alone. They are 19 and 22 and are entirely financially independent in the state with the largest increase in cost-of-living in the last few years.
