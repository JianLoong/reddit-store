Your husband said she did not need to move out.  And she thinks (or says) she can't afford to live elsewhere, which you seem to reject out of hand.  Your next discussion should have been with your husband, not with her.  So now you've positioned yourself as the stepmom who's trying to give her the boot from \"her\" house.  So talk to your husband and figure out what the next step's going to be.  \n\nWord of advice, it will not be desirable to have the baby in your room for any length of time at all.  Even when the kid sleeps through the night (which won't be right away), the kid's still active and making noise.

She's only 23 and it's expensive and hard AF to move out on your own right now. I know people double her age that are having issues. You're basically kicking her out to make room for YOUR baby...both you and her father are TA. My heart breaks for this girl.", "Info: what\u2019s her salary like, are you in a HCOL area, etc?\n\nThe housing market is rough right now to save the least and it would be shitty of you to kick her out if she genuinely can\u2019t afford to live on her own.

You need to discuss with your husband period get aligned and he have the discussion.   Especially as you said you are not close with hers.\n\nYou deliberately left huge amount of details.  How long have you been married,  how long have you lived together, was daughter living their before, how is the mortgage joint,  is the daughter paying rent etc etc.", "NAH \n\nYour adult step-daughter moving out is a perfectly reasonable solution to the problem at hand.

She may also feel like she is being replaced by Dad's \"new family\".", "INFO, what trimester are you in?", "ESH (besides the step daughter who is caught in the middle) - editing this to change my judgment. \n\nIt sounds like you and your husband aren\u2019t on the same page. You convinced him to tell his daughter she needs to move out, but then in private he took it back and told her she did not have to leave. So then, you decided it was OK to go behind his back when you again chose to bring this up with your stepdaughter. Is your plan to basically shame her until she leaves?\n\nOf course she is upset. She\u2019s scared that her stepmom will convince her Dad to kick her out at a time that inflation and cost of living are through the roof, and her Dad is being wishy-washy and not clearly setting boundaries and expectations for her.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting you don\u2019t mention your husband' age or whether you financially contribute to the household. But look. You are the second wife. He had a family before you. You can\u2019t make unilateral decisions just because you decided he needs to put his \u201cnew\u201d family 100% ahead of his old one. Maybe get some couple\u2019s counseling, because it doesn\u2019t sound like you and your husband are communicating well at all.", "YTA - No matter what you say or what you do, there is no way to avoid it feeling like she is being pushed out of her Dad\u2019s life for the new baby. It was her home first, he was her Dad first. Apologize now, because you damaged an already difficult relationship.", "NTA but out of curiosity, why would you put a new born baby in a room all by themselves ?

Basement?", "YTA and also why do women keep shacking up with men who have daughters close to their age?", "NAH. Your concerns about space are reasonable and stepdaughter is a young adult. But many young folks are staying at home longer - partially due to being unable to afford their own space, like your stepdaughter, and getting a roommate that's a stranger is a scary prospect for a lot of people. \n\nShe is also likely feeling replaced by the new baby. Dad has a new wife and new kid and suddenly there's no room for her anymore. Most kids still expect to have a room at their parents' after they move out, at least for a while. It sounds like you're planning to clear out her space for the baby - which leaves her without a safety net to come home to.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you were ill intentioned, but I'm not sure shoving stepdaughter out the door is the solution.", "NAH even tho you raw dogged it without the room available for the result.  Sounds like you married an older man without the accompanying bank account, with no real assets brought to the marriage by you, even at your age, so I feel sorry for your short-sightedness.  You'll be fine with the infant in your room for the next 2 years.  I don't know if you noticed, but a lot of kids are staying home with their parents much longer because they can't afford to live.  I told my son-in-law who lives with me rent free, people can afford a car payment, or housing payment, but not both in this market.  One or both are gonna give somewhere.  You're VERY short-sighted.  I gave my judgment, but I'm totally team SD.", "INFO how old is your husband?", "NAH tending towards NTA, \n\n  \nSounds like a tough situation. You need that space for the coming baby on one hand, but on the other hand it sounds like your step-daughter isn't able to fully support herself if she moves out.\n\nThe reason why I'm tending towards NTA is the extensive help you have offered her, while she acted immaturely instead of talking it out and voicing her concerns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of paying for the first 2 months maybe pay for a portion of the cost for the apartment, so she has less monthly burden? Also a roommate is always a good option to reduce costs (as already proposed by you). She will have to move out at some point anyways, it's a part of growing up and becoming independent.", "\"Oi, time for you to fuck off, off you pop, your replacement will be here soon and despite the fact that for the first 6 months they don't need an entire room, you need to go now even though there's a cost of living crisis etc. Don't care and I'll keep raising it with you.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou know that she's not super close with you for a reason, don't you, and that you're also replacing her - even if you're not, it does look that way, even to an adult?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou made a decision to have a child despite not being in the financial situation to house that child without turfing someone else out to make room. She's going to absolutely loathe you if you push this you understand? And she'll likely be fine with her father ... until he potentially also realises it was a shitty move and based on you bringing a life into the world you couldn't fully fund or house?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShe told her dad privately because she doesn't like you, or trust you, and you only further cemented that by bringing it up. The smarmy \"But we'll help you decorate and help with some rent!\" doesn't really help when, after two months, her wages don't enable her to keep the place. But by that point you won't give a shit, right, because *new baby* and you got your way?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYTA. You can either accept that and push and push and alienate her, deprive the baby of an older sister and ultiamtely alienate the father or, just an idea, find a bigger place where she can continue to live with you WHILST paying a rent so it's affordable. Or maybe plan your family better next time before getting pregnant and THEN thinking \"Oh shit, where's it going to stay, whoops, looks like your kids on the bounce!\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe average age to leave home isn't 18 now or even 25. Most young people cannot afford to leave home and don't particularly want to live with strangers weirdly. And no, I'm older than you, but apparently not quite so callous.

You are being unrealistic about decorating a new place.  Leave the discussions with her to your husband.", "YTA.\n\nYou're barely a decade older than your step-daughter, leave her parenting to her actual parent.\n\nSecondly, yes she's behaving badly towards you; you're trying to kick her out of her home.\n\nThirdly, have you any idea of the economic fuckery going on in the world today? Completely unsurprising that a full-time (presumably entry-level for a 20something) job cannot cover expenses.\n\nEdit: Grammar", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you plan for this before you decided to have a baby in a home that doesn\u2019t have space for a baby?", "YTA. Your concerns are understandable, and you started this okay, but its the second attempt you made after the first no. Your not her mother. And from the sounds of it you have no interest in her being a part of your family.", "Yta. Ewe, ewe, ewe\u2026 you sound like a selfish woman. Who moves in and tries to kick her new \u201cdaughter \u201c out of her room for a baby. Of course she can\u2019t afford to move. You sound like a gold digger to me.", "YTA. You shouldn't have brought it up again.", "NTA\n\nOnce baby is a few months old is she willing to share a room or is she expecting you to keep baby in with you forever?", "ESH because you should have had this discussion a long time ago when you first got pregnant. It\u2019s not easy to live alone so springing it on her is not fair but it\u2019s also not unreasonable to what space for your baby. Can you not afford a bigger space?", "Of course she's upset -- you're essentially kicking her out of her home, no matter how you dress it up with offers to help her decorate.  Did you just assume that your stepdaughter would be happy to move out? She probably also has all sorts of feelings about getting a new half-sibling and now you're telling her she has to leave her home.\n\nI get where you're coming from and I can see that this makes you unhappy. I'm going with NAH but I really think there were some different choices you and your husband could have made here.", "YTA insensitive, non-empathetic and selfish . Your baby will stay in your room for the first 4-6 months of their life anyway so maybe give her the chance to bond with her new sibling and possibly HELP you out a bit through sleepless nights. Did you stop to think about the positives of her being there instead of the negatives ? If you two  can\u2019t  afford a bigger home what makes you think she can afford a place on her own ? Let\u2019s be realistic and sensible here.", "Do you rent or own?\n\nIf you rent, how much more would it be for a 3 bedroom?\n\nMaybe she could pay the difference?", "YTA. You don't get to kick out a child so you can replace them with another one. How are you about to be a parent and contemplating this???", "info: Did she live there before you moved in? If so what discussions did you and your husband have around that ?", "NTA and YTA. You\u2019re not the asshole for wanting her to move out. You are the asshole for bringing it up with her after her dad told her she could stay. You should have had another talk with your husband to figure out what you guys can do to come to a solution. Instead of paying two months rent can you pay part of her rent every month?  Or maybe all of you move into a three bedroom place and she pays part of the rent and utilities. Once you guys had figure out some ideas that were feasible then both of you should have asked her when she could sit down with you for a chat about how to work out future housing.  If she likes the idea of all of you moving to a bigger place then have her work out how much she can afford for rent and then figure out your budget for a new place, knowing that you guys may have to subsidize her to get a place you want. Although she shouldn\u2019t be asked to pay more than 1/4 of the rent as they\u2019ll soon be four of you and you\u2019ll have the baby in the third bedroom.  If she doesn\u2019t like that idea maybe you guys say that they baby can stay in your room for it\u2019s first year (realistically probably longer) so she doesn\u2019t have to move out immediately but can save money for the rest of your pregnancy and that year then find a place she can afford. It also gives her time to work on getting promoted (hopefully her job has upward mobility), find a second job, find a roommate, or maybe she\u2019ll get involved with someone and they decide to get a place together.  You and your husband are a team so you need to figure what you guys can contribute financially, logically, etc. Then you all need to sit down as a family to figure out what works for all of you. You also need to apologize to her for trying to push her out after she\u2019d been told she can\u2019t stay and you need to apologize to your husband for not presenting a united front/crossing boundaries by countermanding what he told his daughter. You need to acknowledge to both of them that it really wasn\u2019t your place to say what you did, especially without your husband\u2019s backing.", "NTA I think it's ok to ask, especially because you aren't just throwing her out. You're willing to help financially and to help with finding a roommate if need be.\n\nMoving out is a big step, so it's normal for her to have a lot of feels about it. What would hold her back from being ok with having a roommate?", "NTA. You offered to help find her a roommate. The fact that she ran off to her room (this is a 23 year old adult, not a child) when you offered to help sort out expenses shows that she isn\u2019t serious about even trying and just wants to live rent free. She isn\u2019t owed a free place to live for the rest of her life.", "NAH. What is she doing to improve her chances of leaving? This is a 23 yr old, not a child. Is she taking any classes for a degree or a certificate? You say she works full time but where? Can you say hey live rent free for the next 6 months but than ya gotta go. That\u2019s plenty of time to save up and find a roommate if need be.", "NAH\n\nThis is a tough spot.  The reality is that cost of living is high and despite that housing is still in high demand.  That means finding a place is going to be hard no matter what.  Your frustration is understandable, but you need to realize that Stepdaughter is functionally in the same boat as you with not being able to afford another place.  I'm sure a 23-year-old doesn't want to live with a newborn, but I think she realizes that she doesn't have another option right now.\n\nTensions are high and the best thing I think you can do is sit both husband and step daughter down and tell them that your sorry if your request stirred up tention but if your all going to fo forward you need to pull together.  There's about to be a fourth person in that house with you and it's only going to get more stressful.\n\nAnd before anyone says \"Why should OP have to apologize?!\" Because sometimes the first step of conflict resolution is extending the olive branch.", "YTA.  Are you completely ignorant to the cost of living crisis right now?  Two months rent won\u2019t help anything in the long run if her salary doesn\u2019t exceed her living expenses. If you\u2019re in the US, 56% of adults ages 18-24 currently live with their parents. This is up from 52% in 2020 so it\u2019s only getting worse. If she says she can\u2019t afford to move out, she\u2019s most likely not lying.  You\u2019re extremely out of touch for someone only ten years older than her. Of course her father isn\u2019t going to kick her to the curb in the middle of a housing epidemic. \n\nYou should stop focusing on kicking her out and start focusing on how you can make your house fit your needs.  Is there an additional area in the home that can be converted into a bedroom?  If you can afford a new home, can you afford an addition?", "YTA. You\u2019re not thinking about how difficult it will be for her on her own.\n\nYou also went behind your husbands back and tried again after your husband said it was ok.\n \nLeave her alone and let the baby sleep in the room with you.\n\nParents sleep with their kids all the time. IMO its actually safest and more convenient.\n\nBtw who\u2019s house is it ? if it was his first before you came along, that means you\u2019re trying to kick his daughter out her own home for your baby.", "NTA. She is an adult, yes prices have gotten more expensive yet that does not mean all adult childern live with parents. She can live with roommates like most Adults her age. If she isn't already she should be paying you guys rent too at that age.", "YTA. You can\u2019t afford another place to live with combined incomes, but expect stepdaughter to be able to?\n\nAnd put yourself in her shoes.

Would you be acting sweet as pie in this situation?", "This is a great question/thought.  Will be stalking for OPs response", "But will they qualify for the mortgage? You're not wrong about it making a difference for being able to pay the bills, but I know a lot of banks are pretty strict about what you can count as income and how you can prove it when you apply.", "> But it\u2019s time for her to leave the nest.\n\nBe removed from her home by a woman merely 10 years older than her do she can be replaced as her father's child.", "She says it's a 2BR.", "I would like to know how old the Dad is. Curious that OP left that out \u2026", "Regarding baby in the parents\u2019 room:  it\u2019s actually recommended that the baby sleep there for at least the first 6 months in a bassinet or similar. After that they can be moved. There are of course exceptions like parents such light sleepers that baby sleeping noises keep them up so they choose to move the baby to their own room early.  \n\nSo the baby doesn\u2019t NEED their own room right away but it\u2019s also much easier to prepare the nursery before you have the baby so it\u2019s all set up when you need it. Plus you need somewhere to put all their stuff.", "we all sleep better with baby in our room!! every family is different. it will be challenging finding space for all baby stuff though.

She also ran off to her room when OP tried to help her sort out the logistics/expenses.", "The discussion should be with her dad.   Not a stepmom who is 10 years older than she is.", "Why did you add the \u201cinfo\u201d when you weren\u2019t requesting new info and just reiterating what has already been said. Also, not being able to afford a new home to buy is not remotely the same as renting with a roommate.", "Love this answer!", "This isn't the case for everyone.

It just happened in your case.Stop being idiotic.", "I currently work in higher ed and this is something that is baffling for a lot of us working with incoming freshman.\n\nThis post here actually gives a lot of insight from their perspective that I hadn't thought of before: https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/10q36ns/the\\_problem\\_with\\_school\\_from\\_the\\_perspective\\_of\\_a/", "The stuff can go in the SD\u2019s room without making her find a completely separate place to live. Baby is going to sleep in the parents room for a few months at least, there\u2019s no need for OP to rush it so much.", "My 9 month old is still in our room. He will probably be there a while. It can be done.", "At 22 I bought a house for my two children and myself. At 23 I was finishing up my contract in the military and preparing for college. That girl is taking the turtle path which is fine and all, but no one is required to finance it.", "Same here - HCOL area, moved further from work for cheaper rent. Gas went up, added a second job. Then rent went up, added a third job.", "Thank you! I don\u2019t get how people think a young professional having to rent an apt with roommates compares to a couple with a baby on the way buying an entire new house.", "Yeah\u2026 also don\u2019t know where they are but in uk you have to pay stamp duty to get a new house which is a big chunk of money. So it\u2019s not really that simple\u2026 think they should suggest as a compromise she moves out by the time baby is 6 months since that\u2019s when they would need their own room.", "Yeah like... My brother is 25 and can't afford his apartment on his own, but he wanted his independence and my parents are still helping him with cost of living. I moved out a few times, but only permanently at 24. I would have gone insane continuing to live with my parents (they aren't awful, mind you, I just couldn't live with rules that weren't my own anymore). \n\nMaybe some people find it more comfortable that way (one of my friends is nearly 30 but chooses to still live with their parents despite definitely being able to afford living on their own) but I certainly did not. I wanted my own space that I had control over, with my own say in groceries and decor and everything else.\n\nIf they are willing to help her, like my parents are helping my brother, I'm not entirely sure why she wouldn't take that offer? I didn't get the same help but I fought like hell to do it myself because I wanted to be independent at any cost. They're not asking her to stay out of their lives or never to ask for help or visit, so I'm not sure why everyone thinks she's being abandoned entirely or pushed to the side. She's being offered more than many people her age. \n\nIs it that she really just loves living with her dad that much, that the familiarity is too important, that she thinks she will be pushed away and really actually abandoned, or that she simply doesn't want the responsibility that comes with that freedom? Also, where is her bio Mom in all this? \n\nJust to add since people have mentioned cultural differences, I'm not American. I am from South Africa. It is often normal here for people to get married and stay in the son's parents' homes, but generally they are big enough to accommodate multiple families in a case like that. Or people live in the same street as their parents. Super common, but not for money reasons. I still don't really understand why the codependency, but I do know people can prefer it that way.", "Where does OP live where two months rent is *under* $1500? Or is that your assumption based on where you live? Because I can promise you there is nothing anywhere near me that would be under $800 a month for a one bedroom.\n\nI mean\u2026maybe if you lived in the most ghetto, dangerous part of town I suppose. But presumably neither the daughter nor the parents want her to live in a dangerous area.", "Exactly, and that\u2019s the crux of the issue here. OP is with an older man who has a young adult child who is NOT \u201cher family,\u201d so she has no problem throwing her to the wolves. \nKudos to you for being there for your kid in these brutal economic times.", "Right\u2026tell us you live in your moms basement and stream twitch videos and moderate Reddit subs all day without telling us\u2026", "Exactly this. It\u2019s not her fault she can\u2019t move out (from the information provided)", "As long as my husband and I are in this house, our kids can live here.  We do not charge rent, nor are planning to work into our 70s since having them here poses little financial burden to us. Our daughter pays for her own expenses - student loan, car insurance and payment, insurance copays, etc. - except for the rent and food.  We have space and freedom. It's all good for us.", "My daughter is in grad school. She works and is also a TA getting a stipend from that, but I see no reason she needs to pay rent when she could save her money. My son graduates school in December and he knows he is welcome to live at home if he wishes while he gets settled into his next phase of life.", "I remember I mentioned to my Italian friend that my grandmother has money but I don\u2019t. And she was like \u201cFamily money is our money. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d And I had to explain to her that it\u2019s a fend for yourself type of environment here in the States.", "I agree. I'm Spanish. I haven't lived at home for more than 25 years, neither have my siblings, and my parents still have a bedroom ready for us, just in case we ever want/need to come back.", "American culture is very centered around tour nuclear family. You don't expand your nuclear family, you leave your parents and create your own. Due to economy and covid a lot of kids who would have left home at 18-22 stayed or moved back in with parents. The kids expect to be treated as adults, but still get \"kid\" privileges. They get upset if they are asked/tasked with household chores and babysitting younger siblings. God forbid you mention to the kids about wanting them to help you in your elder years. \n\nSo yeah... the family dynamic in America is off... but it's off in all directions and ages. You can't expect parents to provide for adult children and not be able to set ground rules as the matriarch/patriarch (and owner) of the house. The adult children are provided for. Yet it's abusive and toxic to expect them to take care of the younger family members because \"I didn't decide to have kids\". \n\nSo yeah, honestly. In this situation in my American mindset, OP is in the right. The older kid is an adult. They don't have a lot of room for 3 adults and an infant. Especially when one of those adults is most likely going to refuse any kind of care for the baby and complain that the house is dirty and they aren't getting enough sleep.", "Brazilian here, and same. My parents aren't perfect, but even as an adult I can sleep at peace knowing that If for any reason I need somewhere to stay, they Will always make room for me. Just like I would for them.", "And it is hard to believe but rent in a lot of places is 3x-4x what is was even OP was 23.  Even with a roommate there step kid has to pay 3x-4x more which is just not doable for a lot of 23 year old", "This is right", "We also have no idea of the parental circumstances, we don\u2019t what the situation is with Op\u2019s SD mother because she failed to mention it, the father maybe the only parent she has, there could be other emotional factors in play here that are why the daughter doesn\u2019t want to leave not too mention how triggering it would be to know that SM is the one behind wanting her to leave, she maybe feeling pushed out here, then add financial struggles on top of that, that is very stressful for a 23 year old, she\u2019s barely even begun being an adult yet.", "\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffe\u270c\ud83c\udffe", "It is seriously surreal to read all the lecturing about \"times are tough\" from people who were probably very small children during the 2008 crash. Times are often tough. Yet somehow a whole generation of us managed to detach from our parents' apron strings back then...", "Yes, having multiple generations under one roof can be very beneficial for all parties involved. I think it\u2019s a healthy situation if the child matures, chips in and isn\u2019t excused from adult interactions. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the scenario for OP since the daughter isn\u2019t pitching in and storms out of the room and slams her door when the conversation gets uncomfortable. It\u2019s all about courtesy and respect, in my opinion.", "That makes the dad TA for not consulting with OP before going behind her back about a decision that affects both of them.", "So in another year the daughter will be able to move out then?", "AITA is huge on infantilizing women and assuming they can\u2019t make their own decisions.", "This man could be 43..there is nothing wrong with a 33 year old marrying a 43 year old.", "Well I'm sorry to single you out in particular, just the whole thread surrounding your comment and the one above it is calling the guy a creep, calling her a gold digger, saying she was \"groomed\" and just being ridiculous.", "They didn't say everyone was, just that they were, and that was their justification/explanation for why the subreddit would be \"obsessed\" with ages in relationships.\n\nA significant age gap doesn't mean it's grooming, but that doesn't mean double-checking to make sure the person dating someone decade(s) younger isn't a creepy creeper is a bad idea.", "It's not like she popped the baby out and told the step daughter to get out. Asking and then offering help seems like a plan", "Also how much does she get paid? How much is the cost of living in the area? I love when people chime into these conversations with clearly no idea what its like starting off your career and looking for an affordable place to live. Theres a damn reason over half of young adults are still living with their parents and blaming all of them for being lazy is\u2026well\u2026lazy. Housing prices and cost of living has skyrocketed and yet wages have remained virtually stagnant and then boomers and xers will chime in about how easy it is because they were able to do it 30+ years ago.", "THIS!!", "Sorry that was $1500 a month so a total of $3,000.  I live in a rural area and that is the average monthly rent around here now.\n\nIn my area, my house two bedroom, one bath is worth about $180,000.  To upgrade to a three bedroom, two bath house in this area is $350,000.", "Babies don't really need their own room for a while. Much easier to have them in parent's room.

She\u2019d have to live WITH A BABY in a 2 bedroom apartment. I\u2019d be out of there so fast", "Yep, I don\u2019t charge rent either. The kid living with me does pay his own car insurance and cell phone but, that\u2019s it. Occasionally he\u2019ll chip in for groceries but, I don\u2019t require it. He\u2019s young and needs to be saving\u2026not helping his grown ass mom pay the bills.", "How long she stays should be up to her dad. Not new step mom. I'm sure if she was asked for rent or to help with utilities, it would be no big deal. But that's not the issue here, it's space. This entire thing should have been discussed as a family /before/ the pregnancy. I HATE how many times we see on this forum parents not planning things out before popping out more children when they don't have proper room for them. Regardless of how old the children already living in the house are.\n\nI lived at home rent free/with minimal rent when I was in my early 20's, because when I originally moved out at 19 I wasn't ready and nearly unalived myself because of depression. If my dad had gotten his girlfriend pregnant and kicked me out to make room, I would have been absolutely devastated and hurt. Especially if it was the girlfriend urging me to leave and not my dad.", "Who says they\u2019re not fully functional, logical adults who are exercising their adult prerogative to make a decision you disagree with?", "If that was the only problem this sub had with large age gap relationships then why was it even brought up in this thread to begin with", "Even in your area it would be cheaper to get the higher mortgage and have the daughter cover the difference between the old and new mortgage.

No need to decorate an expensive room that you'll have to change in a year or two.", "Your kid doesn\u2019t stop being your kid just because they turn 20, f*cking hell some of you sound like you either are or would be god awful parents, what parent in their right mind would kick any of their children out knowing they would either struggle to make ends meet or not be able to make ends meet at all. Sounds like OP who is only 10 years older than her SD wants her out because she\u2019d rather play happy families with HER child.", "Okay so then she moves out for 2 months, can't afford rent, and either has to move back home or ends up homeless???? You think dad won't take his daughter back? And now kids got a tanked credit score and possibly eviction shit being forced into a situation she's not ready for?\n\nThat AND op is pushing step daughter out to make room for a new family. I'd be fucking pissed too.", "I'm nineteen and share a room with two children, I'm sure OP can find a corner for her step daughter", "So if Dad wants her to stay until she's 40, that's okay? The wife gets NO say? That's ridiculous.", "Until daughter DOES move out then they're screwed", "So like, what's the cut-off? Should a 25-year-old be expected to live away from their parents? 30? 35? 40?\n\nAt some point it has to happen. \n\nAlso, characterizing an expectant mother's wish to have a room for her baby \"play\\[ing\\] happy families with HER child\" is peak something. I'm not sure what something exactly, but it's peak that. And it's awful.", "The wife knew what the deal was when she got together with the father.

But still, for me,  I'm a big believer in \"you can always come home, doesn't matter how old you are\". My brother had some issues and stayed home til 30. I came back home  once as a teen and after a divorce from an abuser in my mid 20's. \n\nI'm 33 right now and you can bet your ass my mom would let me crash on her couch in her 1 bedroom apartment or my dad would move girlfriend's home office into the living room and I'd be in their spare room. In my family, family is there for each other. I don't have kids yet, but if my child wasn't ready to leave the nest, I wouldn't force them to.

For some people it just doesn\u2019t happen, or for whatever reason they end up back living at home because they lose their jobs, their spouse dies and they can\u2019t afford the house on their own, there 1000\u2019s of reasons as to why people end up staying at home or end up back with their parents. The girl is 23, we have no idea how stable her job is, we also have no idea if her father is the only parent she has left and if she is feeling pushed out by her SM, i\u2019d say they should all sit down together and talk it through and try to come up with a compromise together, but just assuming that because she is 23 and therefore her fathers job and parental responsibility is over is just insane, if you don\u2019t have mental maturity to figure out that your kids are for life not just 18 years then you should probably be staying on BC or wrapping it up.", "Coming from Asia where you generally move out when you get married, you guys are wilding and sound insane to me. Hope you know all these expectations are arbitrary. OP and husband should at the very least have thought about whether their current lifestyle (step-daughter included) is feasible before welcoming another baby into the world. \n\nAlso crazy to me that a baby needs their own room to begin with, another thing that\u2019s different here."]}
