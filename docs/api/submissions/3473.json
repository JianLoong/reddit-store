We haven\u2019t even kissed at night due to this and i have tried everything to eliminate the whiskey smell. Yet, she still believes she can smell the faint whiskey, which makes her lose it completely.\n\nA couple days ago, I changed my clothes, showered after it and told her that \u201cI promise the smell is gone\u201d, she proceeds to hug me and quickly runs to the bathroom\u2026 to vomit. She comes back to tell me that \u201cshe isn\u2019t coming near me at night until this baby comes out\u201d. Proceeds to tell me that she was \u201cright\u201d and that \u201cI am being inconsiderate to her introduction to motherhood\u201d. Even thought I think I am being overly considerate and trying my best to get rid of this \u201cwhiskey scent\u201d that she can apparently smell from a mile away. \n\nShe has proceeded to move into our guest bedroom until the foreseeable future, I told her she is overreacting and that it is quite disrespectful.
