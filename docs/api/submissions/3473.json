We haven\u2019t even kissed at night due to this and i have tried everything to eliminate the whiskey smell. Yet, she still believes she can smell the faint whiskey, which makes her lose it completely.\n\nA couple days ago, I changed my clothes, showered after it and told her that \u201cI promise the smell is gone\u201d, she proceeds to hug me and quickly runs to the bathroom\u2026 to vomit. She comes back to tell me that \u201cshe isn\u2019t coming near me at night until this baby comes out\u201d. Proceeds to tell me that she was \u201cright\u201d and that \u201cI am being inconsiderate to her introduction to motherhood\u201d. Even thought I think I am being overly considerate and trying my best to get rid of this \u201cwhiskey scent\u201d that she can apparently smell from a mile away. \n\nShe has proceeded to move into our guest bedroom until the foreseeable future, I told her she is overreacting and that it is quite disrespectful.

YTA. \n\nIf you won\u2019t stop drinking, move yourself to the guest room while you think about your priorities.", "I can testify to the increased sense of smell having had two kids, the youngest being 6 weeks. I could smell even the slightest hint of almost anything, and had a particular talent of picking up cigarette smoke and alcohol, even after my husband had showered, used deodorant and scrubbed the crap out of his teeth. I was lucky it didn't set me off spewing, but plenty of other things did instead, and I relied on medication the entirety of both pregnancies to not spew constantly. \n\nI know for a fact that if I had asked my husband to stop eating or drinking something that was triggering my morning sickness, he wouldn't have hesitated to do it for me. OP needs to get his head out of his ass and make sacrifices, he will be soon enough when the kid is here so should learn how to now.", "Yes, he\u2019s going to have to go at least 24 hours without whiskey in order for his pregnant wife to not smell it oozing out of his pores.", "Also saying just one at night is such a common phrase I\u2019ve heard hospitals prepare for a heavy drinker when they ask about drinking habits and get that response so that\u2019s also kind of a red flag", "Absolutely right about it coming from the inside!! I don't drink but still have a great time out with friends and boy does that smell take a while to go away, even if we're all staying in the same place somewhere and they've brushed their teeth. \n\nFor anyone I've dated I can usually guess what type of alcohol they've had hours after they've been out because the smell just doesn't leave for the night. I don't mind it at all but that's just a normal sense of smell, not pregnant and reactive.", "It's very true.  I can testify to that because when I was pregnant with my second child, I couldn't stand the smell of seafood, eat them, seeing them that would send me kissing the porcelain seat.  Worse was when my mom, her twin, my oldest son in stroller and I took a walk a several blocks in NYC after leaving the car in the parking garage.  We decided to go through Chinatown.  A huge mistake.  I was so sick all of sudden when I took a whiff of seafood around the corner. A whole 9 months of being sick of smelling seafood.  After the birth, all that disappeared to my relief because seafood has been my favorite food.", "Allllll of this.\n\nOP, YTA definitely.\n\nWhen I was pregnant, I could not handle the smell of yogurt. My husband LOVES yogurt. It got to the point that he couldn\u2019t even throw the container away in the trash can after he was done because I could smell it in the kitchen while I was in the living room and if it was in the trash can when I went to throw something else away all bets were off. To this day I still cannot handle that smell.\n\nLuckily, I am not married to someone like you and he stopped eating yogurt for a while to try to help. That\u2019s what you do for the person that is giving up their body to grow another person inside of them. You giving up your nightly habit is a minuscule price to pay in comparison to what she is doing.", "Also, why isn\u2019t the person with the actual disrespectful and problematic behaviour the one in the spare room?", "It may be some kind of ritual to decompress after work (not like religious ritual, but you know). If that\u2019s the case, he could still go through the motions with tea or a soda or something.  Throw some ginger ale in the whiskey glass and pretend.  Like you said, it isn\u2019t enough to get buzzed so he could drink something else.", "Says he drinks \"a glass,\" of whiskey. Depending on the size of the glass and how full it is, we're likely talking like 4-5 shots worth minimum.", "Many of us drink for the flavour not the effect.\n\nThat being said, OP YTA.", "Alcoholism", "I guess for someone without a gallbladder a single glass helps with digestion. Or so I've been told by people with no gallbladder.", "Nah, he'll declare the child disrespectful for soiling himself and disturbing the bliss of his necessary drink, if she and the baby are still around.", "Baby diapers smell faintly sweet when they're breastfed. Pretty easy to clean too.  Solid food makes things start to stink. \n\nAt least in my experience.", "He's even blaming her for vomiting from it. he's not he AH as in asshole.... He's literally the Ass Hat", "Yeah, the whiskey sweat smell is pretty gross. Nothing other than abstaining is going to get rid of it.", "I mean, he doesn\u2019t like his wife, so yeah.", "\u2026 just googling nimrod\nYes! Except f***wit is intentionally inept", "Yeah thats exactly what i mean. Dude really has to question has relationship to alcohol.", "I already have an amazing sense of smell (yes, I'm bragging, it's fantastic). Pregnant, I was essentially Wolverine.", "For my sister it was chicken. She couldn't even look at it without vomiting. The neighbors cooking chicken would make her vomit. Random pregnant woman things.", "Yeah, when I was pregnant I had the best sense of smell, especially for disgusting smells. It was like the worst super power ever!!", "My husband was amazing when I was pregnant.  I was so sensitive to even a little bit of sweat or body odor.  He didn\u2019t smell bad, just like a normal person, and he would shower and put on fresh clothes right before bed so I wouldn\u2019t be sick.  \n\nCooked meat was also vomit-inducing through my 1st & 2nd trimesters.  He only grilled outside and ate his meat separately & cleaned up thoroughly. \n\nWhiskey is not a need (well, perhaps once they\u2019ve experienced toddlerhood). To not consider just stopping because it makes his wife hurl is mind-blowingly inconsiderate and puts him either in the camp of being an alcoholic or just not giving a shit that his nightly whiskey reeks from his pores & makes the woman who is carrying HIS child sick enough to vomit.", "Right. So can you not give up the flavor of something you have once a day so that the person who is literally creating another human being for you doesn\u2019t vomit all over the place? \n\nIf the answer is no, then I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s probably not just a flavor thing.", "Lmao that's honestly worse. At least if he was an alcoholic and prioritizing a chemical addiction over his pregnant wife's wellbeing, that'd make sense, and you could chalk it up to a disease instead of just being really selfish about your little treat.", "Ah yes. I too love the taste of gasoline in the evening.  Nothing like an acetone nightcap.", "Well then he's choosing the flavour of whiskey every single day over his pregnant wife?", "As someone without a gallbladder, I don't need help with digestion. I digest things TOO easily.", "How many gallbladder lackers do you know?", "Nope. Not a thing.", "I was like 10 years old last time I changed a nappy so I'll take your word on that, lol.\n\nBut the nappy won't need to smell that bad for this dude to kick up a fuss.", "Does he think she's forcing herself to vomit? Because who in their right mind sees someone throwing up and is like 'she is so disrespectful for reacting like that'?", "He really does. As much as I like having a drink if a pregnant friend asked me not to because the smell  bothered them, I wouldn\u2019t even consider arguing. And that\u2019s just for a friend.", "That is my case as well.", "Me too! Ridiculously sensitive sense of smell is our useless superpower.", "Ha! I have a very muted sense of smell and when I was pregnant I could smell so much more! Over and over I would be surprised at how strong a scent was- good or bad- and then my husband would tell me that's what it always smells like. \ud83d\ude06 I glimpsed the world of people who smell things and I don't really miss it. The world is pungent.", "Oh no, I\u2019m kind of dreading a future pregnancy now. My husband is in awe of my nose on the daily. It\u2019s like a superpower.", "For me it was onion, the smell of it made me dizzy and nauseous, it dragged on weeks after I gave birth. \n\nI can smell someone cooking onion miles away. I avoid going to park where it\u2019s very common for Aussie to bbq sausages with lots of onion. I avoid eating out too.", "Before pregnancy I could prepare uncooked chicken to cook. Preparing raw chicken when I was pregnant made me very ill. More than 2 decades later and I still struggle being in the same room as raw chicken. Never had a problem eating it though.. it was a texture/visual thing brought on during pregnancy. Pomegranates.. love them.. can\u2019t handle the appearance though.", "For my coworker it was her father\u2019s cologne. She couldn\u2019t go over to her parents house or sit in their car.  It was so bad she almost passed out a couple of times.", "Yeah but my guess is it is that he's an alcoholic and drinking more than 1 (or a really large 1). Either way he's making choices that suck.", "Could still be a chemical addiction since it is causing a negative effect in his life.", "Nothing gets me snoozy and ready for bed like deepthroating the wrong end of a flame thrower", "If you think whiskey tastes like acetone you're probably buying the cheap shit.", "People who are sitting down to enjoy a single whiskey nightly are not drinking anything that tastes like gasoline.", "An acetone nightcap \ud83d\ude0c ahhh \ud83d\ude0c", "You didn't need to scalp them like that, damn.\n\nlmao", "You are probably drinking the cheap stuff  if it tastes like gasoline lol.", "Also have no gallbladder and same. It\u2019s the worst.", "Oh, I guess I am just gullible for taking their word for it and should have done some research. Thank you for giving me more information.", "For real.", "A very small number, only 6.", "Does the top shelf stuff taste like a banana milkshake? If so that's a whiskey I can get into, otherwise most whiskeys I've come across have varying degrees of that harsh degreaser taste.", "I mean, it doesn't taste good no matter what. There are varying degrees, but it is never good like a smoothie or hot chocolate etc.", "Those people aren\u2019t tasting anything, they\u2019ve been dead inside for years.", "Except that's the default flavour of whiskey unless you mix it with something", "I'm pretty sure I prefer whiskey to smoothies or hot chocolate, and I drink a smoothie every day. I guess you think coca cola is nicer than wine or beer? I guess I prefer complicated tastes rather than straight-up sweetness", "I think you're thinking of like mezcal, whiskey can be sweet or smokey, earthy, spicy, with notes of vanilla or honey. Yeah it's alcohol, but gasoline isn't what it *tastes* like.", "Real question: are you in high school?", "\"complicated tastes\" my guy its just alcohol. yeah, i have had good whiskey (exactly one, mcgillicuddys)  but theres nothing \"complicated\" about taste. its a drink. liking sweet drinks is just as valid as liking the taste of alcohol, but its not because of complex tastes lmfao you just like different things", "True gasoline might taste better. I'm going to go try some", "Do I have to be a chain smoking 70 year old alcoholic to have an opinion on whiskey?"]}
