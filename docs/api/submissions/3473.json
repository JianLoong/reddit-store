We haven\u2019t even kissed at night due to this and i have tried everything to eliminate the whiskey smell. Yet, she still believes she can smell the faint whiskey, which makes her lose it completely.\n\nA couple days ago, I changed my clothes, showered after it and told her that \u201cI promise the smell is gone\u201d, she proceeds to hug me and quickly runs to the bathroom\u2026 to vomit. She comes back to tell me that \u201cshe isn\u2019t coming near me at night until this baby comes out\u201d. Proceeds to tell me that she was \u201cright\u201d and that \u201cI am being inconsiderate to her introduction to motherhood\u201d. Even thought I think I am being overly considerate and trying my best to get rid of this \u201cwhiskey scent\u201d that she can apparently smell from a mile away. \n\nShe has proceeded to move into our guest bedroom until the foreseeable future, I told her she is overreacting and that it is quite disrespectful.

You chose to be a Father, now act like one.  \n\nBesides it\u2019s good practice for when your kid is actually born, because there will be a lot of changes in you new life, where the World won\u2019t revolve around you anymore.", "YTA\n\nYou've tried everything except what she's asked?\n\nShe's had to give up drinking for 9 months minimum, why can't you?\n\nMy wife's 3 months pregnant and I've only had the odd drink when she says it's fine.\n\nIf you can't go without your evening whiskey it almost sounds like you've got a problem", "YTA and probably an alcoholic if you can't quit your whiskey habit for 9 months. Please seek treatment before the baby arrives.", "YTA, is is common knowledge that pregnant women smell everything. I could smell EVERYTHING when I was pregnant. With our first son I could not handle the smell of onions, something I previously liked. My son is 4 and I can still barely stomach them. If you continue making her puke because you refuse to believe her, you will be lucky if she can stand the smell of you after the baby is born as well. My husband gave up alcohol my whole pregnancy because I asked him to. You in fact are being extremely disrespectful not her!!", "YTA. You have clearly not done your homework when it comes to what can happen to a woman's senses, especially their sense of smell, when they're pregnant. Your job is to be supportive of that change, not to dismiss it. An unusual change in sense of smell (both in terms of sensitivity and reaction to certain cues) is actually one of the first ways many women realize they're pregnant.\n\nI'd say to give up whiskey for a month, try it and see how she reacts - it is possible that she won't be sensitive anymore as the pregnancy proceeds, but since you're so clearly TA here, I'll save that advice.", "I think OP spent too much time drinking whiskey and not enough time in science class. How does he think a breathalyzer works? You can\u2019t brush away the byproducts your body gets rid of through exhaling.", "My husband, soon to be ex, never understood that drinking shouldn\u2019t be your first priority. He has told me every justification in the books, but my favorite is that beer is mostly water, and therefore doesn\u2019t affect him much. This was in response to my concern that he\u2019s going through a six pack every night in front of our son.\n\nOP, get your gd priorities straight because at this moment, you don\u2019t deserve her.", "And it\u2019s whiskey! I don\u2019t have to be pregnant to be able to smell whiskey in someone\u2019s breath, even after they brushed their teeth. It\u2019s pretty strong.", "I feel so bad for the wife. She must be realising what the rest of her and her child\u2019s life is going to be like. Second best to whisky all the time. She must be so sad and scared \ud83d\ude1e", "Took me awhile to find this post before I did. It's oozing out of ya OP, though in smaller amounts, but your wife's nose is in amplified mode", "It\u2019s apparent he\u2019s not ready to be a parent", "That just illustrates how deep rooted his drinking problem is.  He\u2019s delusional.", "This was my thought. No, he didn't tried everything, so YTA OP. The simplest way of getting rid of the smell is to stop putting it in your belly \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This is truly what floored me is he called her fighting for her effing life (fighting to prevent a vomiting episode, if i drop the dramatics) \"disrespectful\" toward him. Like bro she is only human she cannot do it all. Especially when you do nothing.", "funnily enough alcoholism isn't really about getting buzzed, it also isn't measured solely on the pure amount you drink, in fact one of the biggest indicators is regularity. \n\nthe fact op can't go a single night without a drink, like the possibility of doing so doesn't even seem to cross his mind, basically screams alcoholic in denial. \n\nNot every addiction is about \"getting high\", he has simply entered a feedback loop where he has to drink (even if it's just one drink a day) or his brain (and quite possibly the rest of his body, though the \"brain part\" of an addiction isn't necessarely 1:1 with the \"'rest of the body' part\" ) starts bombarding him with messages that there is something missing that he absolutely needs.", "I\u2019m honestly surprised she has not in fact thrown up on him at this point. \n\u201cHey babe, I got rid of the whiskey smel\u2026\u201d *barf* \u201cOr not\u201d", "And its a selfish take. Choice can also be viewed as \"whisky or literally make wife vomit\".", "Steak! Se have to give up steak! \ud83d\ude2d Well technically we don\u2019t, you can have it well done, but who would do that to a lovely steak.\n\nCurrently 9 months pregnant. I want steak. And wine. And Brie. \ud83d\ude02", "AND he tried some basic hygiene.", "Not even Iranian.", "This, OP, YTA\ni mostly stopped drinking coffee in home office during the first month of the pregnancy of my wife. After month 4 or 5 the problem faded, first coffee and open window was ok, later coffee was ok, and at last i could brew up my beloved mokka again. (i made a view coffees when she was on the other end of our flat, with lots of closed doors and knowing that i would do the cooking and serve here everything she needed. she still could smell it hours later, but it didn\u2019t make here sick this way. Senses of pregnant women are extremely sensitive!)", "No kids, but I can always smell when my SO has had whiskey. Even after showering and brushing teeth. Every other alcohol doesn't bother me, but whiskey, bleh", "I couldn\u2019t be in the same *house* as cooked bacon for an entire pregnancy and the scent still made me nauseated for 2 years until I got pregnant again- and it was the scent of coffee that made me want to vomit. I could smell it on my husband for hours after. \n\nHe gave up eating bacon at home for a year and brewing pots of coffee for an entire pregnancy. Because we are a team in making those babies and this family. So he made a team effort with me. \nYTA", "I have a support person come to my house twice a week because I\u2019m disabled, and when she was pregnant she couldn\u2019t stand the smell of coffee because it made her super nauseous. What did I do? NOT have coffee the days she was over. It was extremely easy! This is just basic decency.", "As your body metabolizes alcohol, some of the byproducts are excreted through the lungs. Many of those byproducts can be detected and probably have some smell. \n\nOther byproducts are excreted in the urine, which can therefore smell different from unadulterated urine.", "I have hayfever and other related allergies. The enhanced sense of smell during pregnancy makes me more congested.", "I have weird scent stuff and I've never been pregnant, but I can smell things on people and I can't help it because it triggers migraines. Sometimes I can even smell things on people that they can't smell and didn't do themselves (daughter vaped in his house and it was on his clothes). He couldn't smell it but I could.  \n\n\nI would not wish this on anyone.", "There is! It is actually pretty decent. I am in the UK though so maybe not available for the market you are in.", "Also, it's EVERY night. These people don't think of themselves as alcoholics - until they have to stay in hospital and get delirium tremens on the third night. Heck, a lot of them still stay in denial after that.", "not always\n\nI've saved a whole lot of gastrointestinal upset by being able to smell when something is even a little \"off\"", "Not useless!  I identified a broken pipe under the house by the smell and we were able to get it fixed before the slab cracked. Not even the plumbers believed me because usually they can smell it (by the time the slab cracks) but once they sent the camera down they could see it.   Saved us tens of thousands of dollars!", "I am laughing like a loon, thanks! Eyes are tearing, just hilarious!", "In blind tests, most people cannot reliably smell the difference between parmesan and vomit.\n\nIt's context that makes the smell of Parm good. (It always smells of vomit to me though.)", "Weird question but \u2026 can you smell cancer patients too? Like, I can smell a distinctive smell from every person I\u2019ve ever known with cancer. But I\u2019m not brave enough to ask more questions and try to figure out if I\u2019m smelling chemo, or some drug or medication, or what", "When I was pregnant especially, but generally anytime, I could smell the beer my ex had before lunch at work every day. It didn't make me sick but I could always smell alcohol. He tried everything just to test me cause he didn't believe I could smell it that long after. I could and he learned quick never doubt the super sniffer....I love you Gus!!!!!!..... I have a theory as to why it was alcohol I could sniff out like McGruff the crime dog, my mom was a super alcoholic. Beer ruined my childhood. So I think that's why that particular smell is permanently imbedded in my mind.", "It's really good to hear that other people have the same thing I do! Definitely agree about the gift bit, it's great for stuff like cooking, not so great when you can also smell all the bad stuff really easily!", "Maybe that\u2019s why we generally think farts are less funny, lol", "Me too! Nobody else could smell it, then the gas company guy came out and picked it up on his instruments. \n\nLuckily it was before the meter so it was the gas company's responsibility and they sent a truck within a half hour.", "I can smell if I have strep throat in my own breath! And can tell if I\u2019m about to get sick from how my mucous tastes when I cough. Sometimes I can catch it early and head it off with rest and vitamins. But I\u2019ve got nothing on my grandma. She once got mad because a cat was in the yard. She wasn\u2019t sitting anywhere near where she could see outside, but when I looked out the window, lo and behold, there was a cat peeing in her flower bed.", "My kids smell different, when they have a fever. And I don't mean sweaty or something. Just different somehow.", "Chemo smells different from medication. Idk how to describe it other than \"it smells like radiation\", kind of iron and acidic? \ud83d\ude05 Medication smells a bit more... sharp and musty (mustiness varies depending on how ill they are) And then the cancer patient themselves just smells... sick."]}
