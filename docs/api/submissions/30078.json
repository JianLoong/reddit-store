So my wedding was a Saturday and we had guests in from out of town leaving on Sunday so we had MIL take the left overs to her house to store until we could make room and freeze any left over cookies. I easily had 8 trays of food, 10 boxes of cupcakes and 3 trays of cupcakes left. We arrived Monday after the wedding to retrieve our stuff to take to our house only to be informed that we were now down to 3 food trays, 3 boxes of cookies and some cupcakes.  I was furious but bit my tongue until a couple days later. Turns out the SIL went and raided our stuff taking food and cookies to take home with her. Keep in mind I allowed people to take togo stuff from the wedding and expected what we took home was ours. The same day we picked up our stuff we also received a phone call she wanted more of our cookies and cupcakes to take to work. AITA for getting pissed off and causing a fight with my husband after only being married a few days?\n\nUpdate for those asking. The food was pack up and taken to MIL\u2019s house following the reception because she had the room at the time to keep it for us knowing we would not be able to get there until Monday to pick it up. Had the SIL asked I would have been more than willing to share it was a decent amount of food and sweets. I\u2019m upset that she didn\u2019t ask us, took it upon herself to help herself and then had to nerve to ask for more. I\u2019m not a selfish person but i was upset when I wanted to get something it was gone.  I\u2019ve said to my husband many times while we were dating about his sisters behavior because this isn\u2019t the only time she has acted entitled, and he just blows it off maybe because he knows how his family is.

I think you should have asked what you wanted to keep and how much SIL could take before she did. On the other hand, I do think that it would be best to ere on the side of it being a miscommunication and not have been done with malice and letting it go after perhaps a simple explanation to SIL that you'd planned to keep the food and wish she would have asked first (maybe she considered the wedding weekend to be included, or MIL didn't want to bother you, and / or that there was so much food that would seem to go to waste if not packed up properly or eating soon and thought eaten was better than tossed, etc).", "NTA\n\nSIL: Presumptuous in the extreme.", "Info: what did your husband say about her taking the food?

In some families, leftovers are fair game (because the assumption is the host would have been fine with guests eating everything at the restaurant/reception, so it\u2019s no big deal if guests take leftovers).

The SIL stole hundreds of dollars worth of catered food that someone else paid for . . . just helped herself to it without asking them if it was okay. She had no indication that they were going to throw it out. Quite the opposite, it was clearly being stored at the MIL's house for them because they WANTED it. What they chose to do with it was none of her business: it was their food, that they'd paid for.\n\nHow did she know that they weren't going to take it to THEIR places of work? Or freeze them? Again, honestly, it wasn't even her business. They paid for that food, it wasn't hers. She stole it. Stealing isn't a miscommunication, it's just stealing.", "Not related but your name is referring to Bartok the magnificent?", "The husband is not on her side issue", "It\u2019s called common sense.\n\nIf someone leaves a tray of cupcakes in the office\u2019s shared space, it doesn\u2019t mean that one person can come up and take everything but one cupcake.", "It is not the SIL business to make that call no matter how much food is left. A reasonable person should not need to be told not to touch food that is not theirs and more importantly to the post, take over half the food without asking and getting explicit permission to do so. OP is not an AH whether they said anything or not.  The in-laws should have asked before touching.", "I\u2019d send her an invoice for the food she took.", "At least she shared it with others. I'd be pissed though too. What if it was your plan to share all of those extras with YOUR coworkers and now you suddenly can't because of her entitlement? She stole from you and her brother...", "So, it's still rude to take food without asking. Ask her if she'd like to pay for the food that you paid for.", "Who paid for this food from the wedding?  I'm thinking she should be paying you back for some of this...", "\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You\u2019re NTA for being upset, she was totally out of line. However, knowing how she is and..*love my in-laws but sometimes they really over step their boundaries\u2026* you should have had a better plan in place than for the food to go to MIL\u2019s house. Now you know.", "That is super rude then. She stole your food to feed from your point of view total strangers who didn't even need it like homeless people for example. So I think it was just about her wanting to be in the limelight at work, currying favors on your cost.", "Then bill her and tell her it was already spoken for.", "So she took more than half of your catered food, that was paid for from your pocket, to feed to her *coworkers* without asking you first, then asked for more. That is audacity of a different level, wow. \n\nYou could always \u201cleak\u201d this post\u2026.\n\nNTA of course", "You\u2019re honestly under reacting. It\u2019s literally week one of being married and he\u2019s letting his family steal from you and expecting you to suck it up??? I would be taking my ring off and telling him if he\u2019s going to start off a marriage like this I want no part. He\u2019s not going to change at this point. He will pick them over you again.", "Perhaps but if OP was this pressed and possessive over 8 trays of leftovers she should have been more clear about her passionate desire or she should have taken them home or locked them up.  \n\nBecause SiL was reasonable to assume that 2 people did not want 8 whole trays of leftovers.", "And you said \u201cthis is what I want for the rest of my life\u201d? Girl.", "Yup. As I noted in another comment, that food didn't magically appear out of thin air, you paid for it. Likely a lot of money to a caterer. Trays and trays and boxes of food . . . we're talking about hundreds of dollars' worth of food that you paid for and she stole. Because that's what this is: theft. You bought all that food and she just walked off with it. She owes you a LOT of money.", "How do I follow someone for the upcoming posts that we all can count on? \n\nWow, I would say \"poor thing\" but she signed up for this.", "Yes thieving.SIL did not pay for it so has no right to make any  claim on a single crumb without asking.", "No SIL was not reasonable to assume that.  OP could have other plans for that food. No reasonable person would ever assume they had a right to touch the food without asking", "So your going to need to start standing up for yourself and shutting her down. You'll need to start rejecting her and keeping her out of family events if she can't behave herself and stop helping her to your things. \n\nYou need to give her a list of oundries and the a list consequences and let her know tht hr entitled behavior won't be tolerated anymore. \n\nYou won't get the trays from her but I wouldn't allow her into my house if I'm cooking, she might just bring Tupperware to steal it all.", "Oh honey", "Why did you marry someone who doesn't have your back??\n\nIf you remain married to this wimp, this will be your life, and his family will mow you over and walk all over your boundaries over bigger things than cookies, you can bet on it.\n\nIs this what you REALLY want?  Please take a long hard look at this.\n\nOh, and NTA by the way.  Your SIL stole from you, plain and simple.  Her behavior was outrageous.", "I will paraphrase what I commented earlier:\n\nNext time he says, \"That's just how she is,\" reply, \"And this is how I am. Are you putting in as much effort trying to change who she is as you are trying to change who I am?\"", "Your husband can't back you up for something as simple as this?  Then he shouldn't be married.  You both make poor decisions it appears.", "Doesn\u2019t look like he got the memo.", "I find this mindset weird and possessive.  I'd avoid attending anything you held because people who are so measly and stingy about food are just....ick.", ">No SIL was not reasonable to assume that\n\nIt was a very reasonable assumption unless OP and her husband are pigs.  2 people who are going to gobble down 8 trays of food before they go bad are pigs.\n\n>OP could have other plans for that food. \n\nAnd aliens could have come down and needed the food.  \n\nIf OP was going to give the food away, what does it matter.  The food was going to a person who would appreciate it. \n\n>No reasonable person would ever assume they had a right to touch the food without asking\n\nA reasonable person who had been told to take the food from the reception, saw 8 trays of food at their moms house and not even at the persons house and didn't think 2 pigs would want 8 trays of food before it went bad would reasonably assume they could take it.", "Don't say that, SiL might want a bowl of pasta!", "This is pretty much what I was thinking. That food wasn't free. I'm amazed that more people aren't talking about that. She didn't \"take\" all those trays and boxes of food. She stole it. She stole what amounts to HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS of (I'm guessing catered) food that at some point YOU PAID FOR.\n\nWhether that food got eaten at the wedding or not, it was food that you bought and paid for, and it was yours to do with as you pleased. Baked goods like cookies and cupcakes freeze beautifully. You could have had them to serve to house guests or for yourselves for the next year or so. She owes you the money you spent on all that food; and that's a LOT of money.", "She has both", "WTF? You think they should just \"let go\" the fact that they paid for all that food because \"it was in to-go\" boxes? Do you think the SIL was not aware that she didn't pay for the hundreds of dollars worth of food in the to-go boxes? \n\nLike, do you just help yourself to other people's to-go boxes in someone else's fridge? What is even wrong with you? Are you feral?", "I find you thinking that you have the right to touch other people's things without permission weird and entitled.  It is not about being possessive about food.  It is common decency and respect to ask permission before taking something (anything) that belongs to anyone else.  OP said if asked they would have said yes and I agree that if asked I would share the food but again common decency would dictate if it is not yours ask before taking.", "If you choose to allow love to blind you to any red flags in the relationship - and this is a big one - either be prepared to live a frustrating and disappointing life with this man & his family or accept without complaint that you and your husband will always be doormats to his family.  I strongly suggest counseling for you; alone at first, then later with your husband if your therapist recommends it.  It's troubling that he has a history of not standing up to his family for you and for himself, yet you married him anyway.  Find out why you were willing to settle for this, then act accordingly to improve your life choices.", "Then why are you complaining? You know husband is a doormat and his family is allowed to walk all over you and disrespect you , you also accept it, So welcome to hell of your own making", "Since it all was apparently given to the SIL's co-workers, OP could even go to the extreme of invoicing her employer directly. That would really get the message across!", "Which is why we are asking OP to confirm with MIL that she didn\u2019t give it to SIL.  Mostly so she can avoid a fight with her new husband if it was a big misunderstanding.", ">I find you thinking that you have the right to touch other people's things without permission weird and entitled.\n\nI find you being this stingy and possessive over mounds of leftovers food to be weird and measly. \n\n>It is not about being possessive about food. \n\nIt absolutely is.

Send SIL a bill!", "But she loves him for a long time , and sister in law has been disrespectful since day one and husband accepts it and she chose to marry him .so I don\u2019t understand why she is bitching", "Because she says sister in law and rest of family always disrespected her and her now husband sides with his family , they can do no wrong . Yet she married him and is complaining."]}
