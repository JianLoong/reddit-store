So my wedding was a Saturday and we had guests in from out of town leaving on Sunday so we had MIL take the left overs to her house to store until we could make room and freeze any left over cookies. I easily had 8 trays of food, 10 boxes of cupcakes and 3 trays of cupcakes left. We arrived Monday after the wedding to retrieve our stuff to take to our house only to be informed that we were now down to 3 food trays, 3 boxes of cookies and some cupcakes.  I was furious but bit my tongue until a couple days later. Turns out the SIL went and raided our stuff taking food and cookies to take home with her. Keep in mind I allowed people to take togo stuff from the wedding and expected what we took home was ours. The same day we picked up our stuff we also received a phone call she wanted more of our cookies and cupcakes to take to work. AITA for getting pissed off and causing a fight with my husband after only being married a few days?\n\nUpdate for those asking. The food was pack up and taken to MIL\u2019s house following the reception because she had the room at the time to keep it for us knowing we would not be able to get there until Monday to pick it up. Had the SIL asked I would have been more than willing to share it was a decent amount of food and sweets. I\u2019m upset that she didn\u2019t ask us, took it upon herself to help herself and then had to nerve to ask for more. I\u2019m not a selfish person but i was upset when I wanted to get something it was gone.  I\u2019ve said to my husband many times while we were dating about his sisters behavior because this isn\u2019t the only time she has acted entitled, and he just blows it off maybe because he knows how his family is.

I think you should have asked what you wanted to keep and how much SIL could take before she did. On the other hand, I do think that it would be best to ere on the side of it being a miscommunication and not have been done with malice and letting it go after perhaps a simple explanation to SIL that you'd planned to keep the food and wish she would have asked first (maybe she considered the wedding weekend to be included, or MIL didn't want to bother you, and / or that there was so much food that would seem to go to waste if not packed up properly or eating soon and thought eaten was better than tossed, etc).", "NTA\n\nSIL: Presumptuous in the extreme.", "Info: what did your husband say about her taking the food?

In some families, leftovers are fair game (because the assumption is the host would have been fine with guests eating everything at the restaurant/reception, so it\u2019s no big deal if guests take leftovers).
