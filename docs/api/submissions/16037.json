I don't see anything wrong with him wanting to visit his family once a year if him and they live countries apart and yes, I can understand that parents want to see their children more often the older they get.\n\nThat said, your husband handled it poorly. He should at least have talked to you about the trip and asked you. Maybe you could have made a financial plan for him to go on this trip and both of you making a couple trip later. He's spending your money poorly too if he buys his mother several trips while you seemingly can \"only\" afford one that always ends in him visiting his family.

So how was anyone to know you weren\u2019t fine with it? Like it or not, a lot of families still follow this structure with everyone accepting their roles. You married into it, you said nothing about it, **you tacitly endorsed it**. By raising it like this, releasing your pent-up frustration this way, you\u2019ve actually managed to make yourself the one being unfair! Because in the world of responsible adults, if you do not say you have a problem, *then you do not have a problem*. Now you\u2019ve totally screwed yourself over. Trying to make a change to the structure you and you husband exist in is tough but potentially doable, but not like this. It takes tact and consideration and responsible assertiveness and empathy. Instead you\u2019ve made yourself into an opponent. \n\nSo your husband is an AH for serving this oldschool unpleasant structure, and you are an AH for going along with it for so long without raising any issue, and then raising it as if you have a right to your pent-up frustration, shooting yourself in the foot in the process.", "NTA\n\nBut good luck, you\u2019re gonna need it", "NTA - You will never have any value to your husband.", "A little bit of ESH.

You need to set some ground rules for spending over a certain amount.", "COUNSELING OR DOOR", " Your husband is responsible for his actions. No one is making him send her money, send her on trips, calling her and all the things HE is doing. It is his actions that are hurting you because he has control of what he does, not her. He gives the control to her. \n\nSo NTA for being upset about the situation, but the anger should really be addressed to your husband for letting it happen, not your MIL for taking advantage of him.", "NTA \n\nTime for couples counseling or divorce. \n\nWhat do you want with a husband that doesn't care about you?", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t hate her, you hate that he puts so much effort into her.", "Yta. Is there a chance him and his sister are in the beginning stages of planning a trip and he planned on asking you about it/telling you and you jumped on him and he got defensive?\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re very insecure when it comes to his mom. \n\nI\u2019m female and extremely close with my mom. I buy her groceries, pay her bills, take her on trips with me. If I had enough money I\u2019d send her on trips herself and buy her whatever she wanted. I love her that much. She took care of me as a child and now I get to take care of her.", "It\u2019s so common. OP\u2019s marries a momma\u2019s boy then get mad at the mom for her husband behaviour. Don\u2019t get me wrong he is bad but she chose him and is blaming the mom for the action of the man she chose to marry", "I\u2019m curious why he has to \u201cstand up\u201d to his mother for him deciding to go visit her? Or perhaps to her idea of moving closer to their family? IMO OP is insecure and doesn\u2019t respect he has an important relationship with his family", "I\u2019m American and take care of my mom. I buy her food, take care of her when she\u2019s sick, she\u2019s coming on an overnight vacation with my family and I. And I\u2019m female. It\u2019s just respect to care for the ones who cared for you.", "Agreed.", "So your issue is with your husband... This is why I agree with all the ESH comments. You for blaming MIL for an issue that you have with your husband makes you an AH. Husband is a bigger AH for not having his umbilical cord cut. When you are married or are in a serious relationship, your husband/wife/serious partner should come first over everyone else, including parents, besides arguably your children. Husband is a bigger AH for lying about trip plans and getting defensive when questioned about it.", "This. I was involved with a guy for many years who could have been a mama\u2019s boy. He was the golden child. He made a decision when he went to college that his life had to be his own. He was definitely aware of her manipulation tactics.", "Taking Care of your Parents does not mean you are disrespecting your spouse! Taking care of your Mother does not mean you don't love your wife. Calling her every day to know about her health details does not mean you are abandoning your husbandly duties towards your wife. You can take care of both of them. There shouldn't be any priority list between a wife and a mother! Both are important. You guys are seriously fucked up man! I cannot ever imagine abandoning my parents after I get married. That is straight away brutal! Wtf! \n\nNot everyone grew up with toxic parents. Not everyone has daddy or mommy issues. Some do have a healthy family environment with no divorced or separated parents.", "Not you comparing it to ptsd lol . And who do you think the responsibility even in that case to go to therapy is ? Jesus ?", ">And who do you think the responsibility even in that case to go to therapy is ?\n\nIf a victim doesn't seek help, does that mean the victimizer should not be blamed?", "Independent regarding context,, yes you can be financially independent and still depend on various other things and if he has an unhealthy habit of just doing what his mom pleases him to do without question then he is not independent from her and thus a mama's boy after your definition.\nI think it very odd for him to say \"because my mom wants me to\" and not because she asked and I would love to or something\nAlso there must be a reason why OP was not asked to come with, probably because MIL didn't want her to as a wild guess.", "He's financially independent, but not emotionally/psychologically independent.\n\n>he\u2019s simply providing financial support to his Mom\n\nDid you miss the part where he planned a trip to another country to visit his mum and didn't even mention it to his wife?", "If a victim doesn\u2019t seek help and start victimizing others then it also falls in her. The responsibility to seek help is on said person not anyone else. A victim can quickly also become a victimizer", "That doesn't answer my question: Is the victimizer absolved of blame if the victim doesn't seek help and/or goes on to victimize others? Yes or no?", "I will say it clearly since it\u2019s hard. The victimizer causing the victim  problems is not to blame if the victim chooses not to seek help and antagonize others. Is the victimizer wrong yes . Is it still on the victim to find tools to not hurt other people also yes.\n\nClear?"]}
