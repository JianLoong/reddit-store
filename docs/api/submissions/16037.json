During my marriage, I've observed he's a bit of a mumma's boy, she's in a different country, retired and living with her husband. \n\nHe will call her almost everyday, help them financially, send her on holidays to that she wants to go to etc. He's been saying he wants to bring both his parents to where we are, since they're lonely and and it would be nice to spend time with their grandkids (my husbands sisters kids). Later I did find out that coming here to our country was his mothers idea. I didn't really have a problem with any of this, as it's kind of expected in out culture (we are South East Asians) but I was still low key feeling insecure because it felt like his parents came first. \n\nAnyway, yesterday my husband and I were driving to the shops, when he gets a call from his sister, the conversation went normal until he starts bringing up his plans to visit his parents and how he hasn't found any cheap tickets. I was a bit taken back because I wasn't aware he had plans to visit them this year. After he got off the phone, I asked him about his plans and he casually says he's planning on going since his sister is also visiting this year and wants to go together so they can be together with his parents. I didn't react at that moment, but I was very very upset. \n\nToday, I decided to bring it up, just to tell him how I felt about him making plans without me, especially because I had asked him to go on a vacation this year and he made every excuse under the sun not to. The conversation turned into argument after he says, \"Mum wants me to come, I have to\", in the heat of the moment I said I hated her and he only listens to her, he said some means things afterwards, saying he didn't care about how I felt and my feelings are stupid. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682839450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133ilva/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_hate_his_mother/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have two choices - either continue to play second fiddle to his mother or look to put yourself first without your husband and his family.  It seems very either/or, but looking from the outside in, it's pretty obvious unfortunately.  Best of luck in what you decide.", "NTA \n\nYou are not important to your husband. His mother will always come first. Even his sister is more important than you. He didn't even plan on asking you, his wife, to go on this trip. That's awful. Why are you with him?", "ESH\n\n1. Your husband is wrong for not discussing this with you.\n\n2. Your husband again for prioritizing this trip over a trip with you.\n\n3. Your husband for not considering the thought to ask you if you\u2019d like to go.\n\n4. You for blaming his mother for his actions.\n\n5. Your husband overall for not prioritizing you and your relationship.", "It's one thing that he cares about his parents and whatnot, but I definitely feel like you deserved to know his plans of travelling. Travelling to another country even just to visit family for a few weeks/months, is not an easy thing to plan out.(Alot of family just assume it's like getting a bus ticket and heading over in 10-25 mins, ) when in reality it can be like 10 - 25+ hours.Also there's months of planning to get the right priced tickets, arranging time off, accommodations , packing, buying some gifts, as well as clothes for oneself, etc.Not to mention how things will be taken care of at home, if the bills will get paid on time, even when away, groceries and stuff are there for those who are still at home.(If not everyone is going that is)\n\nThe fact that through all of this planning he didn't seem to mention at all he's going, that's messed up.\n\nThis sounds like something I've seen with my own parents, sort of.\n\nYes you said some insulting things about his mother, INFO but why didn't he mention once, that he was going on such a trip. These sorts of trips take alot out of a family.", "NTA \n\nOnce a Mama's boy, always a Mama's boy.\n\nGet out.  Now.", "ESH It's not about the mother, it's about your hubby who have no spine. Don't push your anger to his mom, speak with him about your wishes and boundaries. It's not okay to make such plans without you, but thats a problem you have with him, not her.", "ESH\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t hide or lie about his plans.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said what you said about his mother. (Also, OP, you may hate his mother, but she\u2019s not the problem. The problem - what you actually hate - is that your husband doesn\u2019t seem to stand up to his mother.)", "ESH, but him more than you. As a South East Asian myself, marriage is (unfortunately) simply not just between two spouses. In our culture, it is often the blending of two families, so one is truly lucky to have in-laws you could actually get along with.\n\nWith that said, he should've included you in his plans; or at the very least, ask or inform you about it. Plane tickets are not cheap, and buying one without you knowing (assuming you two share financial assets) is an asshole move.\n\nWhat you did wrong is you could have expressed your feelings regarding the matter in a better way, instead of targeting his mother who he clearly cares about. I hope you two eventually work this out, OP.", "Ehh...ESH. You could've presented your disdain for his mother in a better way and he could've been more up front about his plans to leave. He hadn't told you and was already booking tickets? That would make me mad too.", "ESH.", "NTA. But, the problem isn\u2019t your MIL. It\u2019s your husband. Have you considered marriage counseling?", "NTA.\n\nYou should divorce your husband immediately before your life becomes a mess. I have seen this happen many times, the end result always the same: husband gets a new woman who's half your age and you are left to recover from the nightmare. This would eventually erode your will to carry on, leaving you bitter and spiteful.\nJust a shame about the kids though.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is telling you your feelings are stupid and you're asking if your reaction is the problem?  His emotional abuse towards you is the problem.\n\nImagine what it would be like if you had a child with your husband.  In your culture does the MIL move in to raise the child?  Think about your future.\n\nYour well-being matters.  Marriage counseling would be the next logical step here.  I would also recommend therapy for yourself.  Therapy is cool.", "NTA", "esh.", "Why did he marry you?\n\nNtA.", "ESH your mil did nothing to you!!!", "ESH. Your husband should discuss his plans with you, but maybe he would if you weren't so weirdly jealous of his mother. She is not your rival. \n\nThere should not be any need for him to rank you and his parents against each other.", "NTA, while he's on that vacation visiting mommy pack up all your shit and leave. Or pack up all his shit and leave it on the porch. You can do so much better, I'm sorry you're currently stuck with someone who doesn't respect you", "NTA at all, but please reconsider any plans you might have to have children with this man. It sounds as though you could end up with your in-laws living with you all, you doing all the work and your husband having zero respect for your time, your feelings or your wishes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Now's the time to consider if you want to stay married to this man.", "ESH. I don't find any reason for you to hate your MIL honestly. You only said that she wants to live in your country to be near you. So, yeah, I don't see anything particularly wrong with it if she isn't MIL from hell. If your husband is a mummy's boy that's a husband problem, not a MIL problem, because he has to set boundaries with MIL. I don't see anything wrong with him wanting to visit his family once a year if him and they live countries apart and yes, I can understand that parents want to see their children more often the older they get.\n\nThat said, your husband handled it poorly. He should at least have talked to you about the trip and asked you. Maybe you could have made a financial plan for him to go on this trip and both of you making a couple trip later. He's spending your money poorly too if he buys his mother several trips while you seemingly can \"only\" afford one that always ends in him visiting his family. What your husband said about your feelings and how they don't matter and are stupid is disrespectul to you. It seems he doesn't value you much and would drop you like a hot potato if it's between you and his family. \n\nSo my ESH stands, because while your husband clearly sucks, your anger goes to a wrong direction and you have a husband problem not a MIL problem.", "I think OP should challenge their MIL to a fight.... like how all the youtubers are doing."]}
