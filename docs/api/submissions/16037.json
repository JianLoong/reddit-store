I don't see anything wrong with him wanting to visit his family once a year if him and they live countries apart and yes, I can understand that parents want to see their children more often the older they get.\n\nThat said, your husband handled it poorly. He should at least have talked to you about the trip and asked you. Maybe you could have made a financial plan for him to go on this trip and both of you making a couple trip later. He's spending your money poorly too if he buys his mother several trips while you seemingly can \"only\" afford one that always ends in him visiting his family.

So how was anyone to know you weren\u2019t fine with it? Like it or not, a lot of families still follow this structure with everyone accepting their roles. You married into it, you said nothing about it, **you tacitly endorsed it**. By raising it like this, releasing your pent-up frustration this way, you\u2019ve actually managed to make yourself the one being unfair! Because in the world of responsible adults, if you do not say you have a problem, *then you do not have a problem*. Now you\u2019ve totally screwed yourself over. Trying to make a change to the structure you and you husband exist in is tough but potentially doable, but not like this. It takes tact and consideration and responsible assertiveness and empathy. Instead you\u2019ve made yourself into an opponent. \n\nSo your husband is an AH for serving this oldschool unpleasant structure, and you are an AH for going along with it for so long without raising any issue, and then raising it as if you have a right to your pent-up frustration, shooting yourself in the foot in the process.", "NTA\n\nBut good luck, you\u2019re gonna need it", "NTA - You will never have any value to your husband.", "A little bit of ESH.
