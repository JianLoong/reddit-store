Later I did find out that coming here to our country was his mothers idea. I didn't really have a problem with any of this, as it's kind of expected in out culture (we are South East Asians) but I was still low key feeling insecure because it felt like his parents came first. \n\nAnyway, yesterday my husband and I were driving to the shops, when he gets a call from his sister, the conversation went normal until he starts bringing up his plans to visit his parents and how he hasn't found any cheap tickets. I was a bit taken back because I wasn't aware he had plans to visit them this year. After he got off the phone, I asked him about his plans and he casually says he's planning on going since his sister is also visiting this year and wants to go together so they can be together with his parents. I didn't react at that moment, but I was very very upset. \n\nToday, I decided to bring it up, just to tell him how I felt about him making plans without me, especially because I had asked him to go on a vacation this year and he made every excuse under the sun not to.

You only said that she wants to live in your country to be near you. So, yeah, I don't see anything particularly wrong with it if she isn't MIL from hell. If your husband is a mummy's boy that's a husband problem, not a MIL problem, because he has to set boundaries with MIL. I don't see anything wrong with him wanting to visit his family once a year if him and they live countries apart and yes, I can understand that parents want to see their children more often the older they get.\n\nThat said, your husband handled it poorly. He should at least have talked to you about the trip and asked you. Maybe you could have made a financial plan for him to go on this trip and both of you making a couple trip later. He's spending your money poorly too if he buys his mother several trips while you seemingly can \"only\" afford one that always ends in him visiting his family. What your husband said about your feelings and how they don't matter and are stupid is disrespectul to you.

I am a woman and I believe both you and your husband are huge assholes in this situation. \n\nYour husband is an asshole because he didn't inform you about this trip. He didn't ask you if you would want to go on this trip. (Although he isn't entitled to take your permission to visit his parents if he is visiting them alone). You are an asshole for hating his parents for no reason.  That lady gave birth to him! Who knew she was gonna get a DIL like you who would one day hate her because her son decided to take care of her?  FU! \n\nThere is nothing wrong with taking care of parents when they are old, funding them, or sending them on trips.  STOP HATING his parents for no reason. \"Mumma' boy\" seriously?  Like wtf is wrong with you all Americans!!  Taking care of their parents makes a man a \"momma's boy\". What happens when it's the other way around for you all women?  \"Daddy's princess\" at that moment? Hypocrites! I wouldn't ever date a man in my life who disrespects his mother or his parents or doesn't take care of them. That simply means he wouldn't be able to take care of me as well and lacks quite a big amount of empathy and sympathy!

You have a husband problem.  He needs to understand that this type of action is unacceptable and that he needs to dial down the parent stuff and focus on his new family.

He did not even think about sharing his travel plans with you. Yet his Mom and sister knew. I am not sure if you want to even try to salvage this marriage.  I am South east Asian also, and my parents and I are very close. Yet my partner is at the top of my list as to where my priorities lay. I would never make any kind of big plans/decisions without first discussing it with my partner. My parents both know this... and would not have it any other way. And yes, my parents are both South East Asian also. They consider my partner their son. \nAnother thing: has your husband ever tried to include you in those regular calls with his Mom? Has he ever tried to encourage a relationship with her? Because if he hasn't, then he's doing both you and his Mom a terrible disservice. You are a family now, and he really should be including you in getting to know his own family of origin.... and vice versa. \nYou were pretty harsh in saying you hate his mother. It sounds like your frustration hit the boiling point. Your husband said that his Mom wants him to come visit, and that may be true, but I highly doubt that his mother told him not to even tell you or discuss his travel plans with you. \nYou have a husband problem. I hope things work out for the best for you. I hope you have a job or some sort of income for yourself. I don't think it would be in your best interest to be completely financially dependent on your husband.", "Do not and I repeat do not allow them to move I'm with you. Your life will be ruined.
