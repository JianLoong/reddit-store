I go to the pantry and grab a portion of some vegan cheese itz alternatives. I\u2019d say there was 10 small squares in the bag. My niece finished it and asked for another. I gave her another not thinking much about it bc she was still hungry and I didn\u2019t want to upset her, her lunch was also kinda small and I\u2019d bet she was genuinely still hungry. \n\nThe next day my sister pulls me and asks why I gave her daughter extra snacks when I should know it\u2019s only one a day.

She knew *exactly* how much there was of every food item in the house.

Fast forward to getting a diagnosis and meds that helped when I was in my late 20\u2019s and the nausea wasn\u2019t constant anymore. I still don\u2019t eat much, but I have to really watch what I eat and my weight because my metabolism is screwed up from not getting enough nutrients as a child. one doctor put it as \u201cyou unintentionally starved yourself to fatness\u201c", "This.

There\u2019s just so much to unpack there and I only hope someone like your niece\u2019s pediatrician is able to put a stop to them.

Calorie counting is not necessary for kids and is potentially dangerous if she is missing growth spurts", "I'm an outlier here--growing up, we were able to just sit and snack willy nilly, so it wasn't uncommon for someone to polish off a bag of chips in 1-2 sittings...and yes, that led to weight struggles. When I saw my kids start to go down that path, I *absolutely*:sat then down and taught them about serving sizes--not to get them to calorie count, but to help them realize that \"single serve\" bags of chips often have 2-3 servings in them and that it's really easy to eat beyond satiety when you're reading or otherwise distracted. Now my kids know to count or weigh a serving of snack food and put that in a bowl or to take just ONE of the *actual* single serve snacks we have. I certainly don't want them to count calories, and if they're hungry after the snack, they're welcome to something else, but that something else needs to be healthy (fruit, veggies, string cheese, etc). All that to say I don't disagree with your sister's desire to limit your niece to one serving per snack food...\n\n**However** the fact that it's *her* serving size is ringing some alarm bells.

That's not a big deal or unforgivable.\n\nWhere you are a bit TA is the way you responded.  Does your niece see a pediatrician regularly and is she developing normally?  If so, I'm sure she gets enough to eat, though this kind of severe food policing does lead to eating disorders (first hand experience).  Your sister isn't wrong, though.  It's her kid, her rules, no matter how archaic and domineering.  Questioning her parenting set her off, and she can not see that this was not a malicious act, meant to \"undermine\" her.   If you could just tell her this, apologize for the mild overstep, and assure her you will follow her rules in the future, it'll likely bring her around.", "This! It's one thing to have healthy snacks but being this strict and counting every calorie a 5YO eats is going overboard and could absolutely give the kid a disorder.

And for sure, it seems like you perceive this regime as very unhealthy.\n\nI feel you have 2 real choices: 1) back away from the topic and heckle from the sidelines, or 2) deep dive into the details of whether this is actually healthy for the child.\n\nThis is tough, because sometimes we have to acknowledge", "NTA, holy shit. i would be so very concerned if i saw someone restricting their kids\u2019 food in this manner.", "NTA, your sister counts food to be sure her daughter isn't eating more this can lead to an ED and also what are they going to do when she's older and hoping out with friends this isn't something sustainable", "NTA as a lot of people have pointed out kids have some pretty crazy calorie intake requirements when they grow. That can go all the way out to teenagers. I remember I stuffed my face with double hotpockets for 500ish calories for breakfast as a teenager and I was still 95lbs. Plus when the kid is independent there will come a day when mommy isn\u2019t portioning the snacks and then the kid has no experience evaluating how much they can eat.", "NTA\n\nAs others have pointed out, this isn't healthy for your niece. She needs enough food to grow, play and learn. What she doesn't need is to lose her natural connection with her hunger impulses, or to learn bad eating mentalities.\n\nMy grandma was a teen during WWII and the starvation winter. She's still tiny and eats very little, even though my mom is relatively tall. There's been research done on people who were kids or teens during the starvation winter and how that has hampered their growth and health the rest of their lives. It's even worse in girls, because they pass part of that health on to their children. In fact, the worse effects were on women who were pregnant with baby girls during the starvation winter. Because a baby girl already makes the eggs that will become her own children while in her mother's womb, the effects of that starving mom-to-be could be seen in her grandchildren.\n\nOf course, your niece's situation is far less extreme. I just mean to say, don't underestimate the importance of enough food to children.", "NTA When I read that the niece is five my thought was literally \"Oh God\" you can't do that. What those parents are doing to that little girl is abuse. It is so, so dangerous to mess around with food like that with kids. They are risking the child's mental health but also their physical health. Good on you for giving the kid extra snacks, maybe try to see if you can help the mother to understand that she is hurting her child by raising her that way. If not you may need to act and report them for potential child neglect or abuse. When it comes to kids that young you can't mess around.
