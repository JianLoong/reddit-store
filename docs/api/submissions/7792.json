I go to the pantry and grab a portion of some vegan cheese itz alternatives. I\u2019d say there was 10 small squares in the bag. My niece finished it and asked for another. I gave her another not thinking much about it bc she was still hungry and I didn\u2019t want to upset her, her lunch was also kinda small and I\u2019d bet she was genuinely still hungry. \n\nThe next day my sister pulls me and asks why I gave her daughter extra snacks when I should know it\u2019s only one a day.

Poor little girl! NTA", "They listen better than adults do. My child will not even finish \u201cjunk\u201d if he\u2019s full. It makes me so sad to think of a five year old growing child having her portions controlled.", "My mom gave me bad eating habits and I\u2019m with you. I mean, I don\u2019t want kids, but even if I did, I\u2019m not having any until my eating habits are better and don\u2019t make doctors concerned about my health.", "My kids know that if they ask for a snack before dinner, all they'll get is fruit.", "Also, winter.

Your sister is creating a child that will have an eating disorder. What kind of control freak counts calories for a growing child? She is messed up. Sorry.", "NTA, what your sister is doing is child abuse. It's going to stunt that kid's growth, introduce metabolic issues, and train the kid into an eating disorder. You were right to leave her place, and I'd consider reporting her to CPS and letting them investigate whether the child is even being fed enough to meet minimum needs. Your relationship with the AH sister is already burned, protect your niece.", "NTA. This is EXACTLY how my own ED started. She can have the best intentions in the world, however she needs to realize that this is going to give her daughter an unhealthy relationship with food for life.", "NTA. Your sister is controlling her daughter with food. She is starving that child. Call CPS. I am not kidding.", "Wtf are these comments? I agree the sister is taking the health stuff maybe a little overboard, but this is her daughter we are talking about so she absolutely gets the say on how to care for her daughter.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call you an AH OP, but to say the sister needs CPS called or anything along those lines is way over the top. Also just saying counting calories and pushing for healthy snacks isn\u2019t child abuse or going to cause an eating disorder itself", "NTA.

Like actually honestly not giving her the caloric intake necessary for growing healthy and strong, you have to start considering a plan for her safety.", "NTA \nYour sister has an eating disorder. She is imposing this on her 5 year old child. This is abuse. \n\nMy kids eat when they are hungry. I always know I need to be ready to clothes shop when they eat an extra dinner portion because hello growth spurt. They will also sometimes just barely pick at dinner. One day of not eating so much, a day of eating regularly, a day of having extras...it's a balance.", "NTA \n\nWhat shes doing is creating a unhealthy relationship between her daughter and food. This could go 2 ways, 1 she keeps restricting herself all her life, 2 she starts to binge once she has freedom and starts to overeat. Both lead to disordered eating. She needs to wake up and realize that shes actually hurting her child.", "NTA my mom did portions BUT not like that!\nIts one thing to use serving sizes and portions as a starting point with a growing child but it's not a way to without food. \n\nIt's one thing to wait a couple minutes between snacks its another to withhold additional snacks entirely and who tf counts the snacks!", "NTA and she is setting your niece up for an ED. Ask me how I know.", "Two things here\n\n1) did she ever say she can\u2019t have two bags????
