Yeah. I got chewed out for this a few days ago and just wanna know if I was really TA here.\n\nI (20F) have a younger brother, (15M), who's an absolute pain in the ass to live with in many ways. One of his issues is he completely lacks empathy and will often do things without caring about how others may take it.\n\nOne night, I noticed my bottle of face moisturizer that I keep in the bathroom was facing backwards and in the wrong spot, and had a dent in the bottle like a lot had been squeezed out. Sure enough a lot more was missing than usual, like 1/4 of the product.\n\nThe only two people who use this bathroom are myself, my brother and my mum. I asked my mum if she borrowed some and she said she didn't, and I believe her. She's not a liar and would just tell me if she had.\n\nIt was pretty obvious to me at this point that my brother had used it. I didn't know for what, and thought maybe he just had some dry skin or whatever, but then I realised he might have used it as lotion to jack off in the shower. I know he does this because he's constantly leaving the dried ejaculate on the shower screen. I've never brought it up because eww, but I'm 20, I know what that shit is. And at waist height as well. I think he tries to wash it off but is too lazy to check if he gets all of it. Sure enough, I noticed there was a suspicious streak in the shower that hadn't been there the night before.\n\nI felt super squicky about using that stuff on my face being 90% sure where some of it had gone. I also don't know if he's ever used some before. I ended up throwing the rest away and have bought myself another tub from a different brand that I'm now keeping in my room. My mum found out I threw the bottle away and got mad at me for wasting it. I tried to discreetly explain but she called my actions \"ridiculous\" and said I was just making assumptions. She's still a little salty if I'm honest, even though I paid for the products myself. I don't normally like to waste things but I was never using that stuff again if I'm being honest.", "created_utc": 1680302734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1282fcx/aita_for_throwing_away_an_entire_bottle_of/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if he simply pumped a large potion out he could have been touching something earlier that might be a little uncleanly (seeing as he doesn't bother to clean up), and if it wasn't a pump, well, you can imagine direct skin contact (no matter the body part) with a load of face moisturizer.\n\nEven if by some chance we could be absolutely certain OPs brother did not 'contaminate' it, some people just outright find it gross.
