Yeah. I got chewed out for this a few days ago and just wanna know if I was really TA here.\n\nI (20F) have a younger brother, (15M), who's an absolute pain in the ass to live with in many ways. One of his issues is he completely lacks empathy and will often do things without caring about how others may take it.\n\nOne night, I noticed my bottle of face moisturizer that I keep in the bathroom was facing backwards and in the wrong spot, and had a dent in the bottle like a lot had been squeezed out. Sure enough a lot more was missing than usual, like 1/4 of the product.\n\nThe only two people who use this bathroom are myself, my brother and my mum. I asked my mum if she borrowed some and she said she didn't, and I believe her. She's not a liar and would just tell me if she had.\n\nIt was pretty obvious to me at this point that my brother had used it. I didn't know for what, and thought maybe he just had some dry skin or whatever, but then I realised he might have used it as lotion to jack off in the shower. I know he does this because he's constantly leaving the dried ejaculate on the shower screen. I've never brought it up because eww, but I'm 20, I know what that shit is. And at waist height as well. I think he tries to wash it off but is too lazy to check if he gets all of it. Sure enough, I noticed there was a suspicious streak in the shower that hadn't been there the night before.\n\nI felt super squicky about using that stuff on my face being 90% sure where some of it had gone. I also don't know if he's ever used some before. I ended up throwing the rest away and have bought myself another tub from a different brand that I'm now keeping in my room. My mum found out I threw the bottle away and got mad at me for wasting it. I tried to discreetly explain but she called my actions \"ridiculous\" and said I was just making assumptions. She's still a little salty if I'm honest, even though I paid for the products myself.

(At least on lady parts-hey, it was accidental!). \n\nYou have to get the water the exact temperature of nothing, to not make it infinitely worse. \n\nAnd nothing isn\u2019t body temp, it\u2019s not room temp either.  It\u2019s just this magical temperature that exists (and doesn\u2019t make icy hot worse).  And it\u2019s seemingly different every time you use icy hot (on non genital skin anyway).", "Pretty sure they're saying it's common knowledge and shouldn't be said, and then implies that the person they're responding to might also be a male teen because of their stance on the matter. So not agreeing with them.", "Sarcasm", "Lol yeah def not confused.  The person I was responding to sounds like a young male themselves.  Meaning they themself wouldn\u2019t get why it\u2019s completely disgusting to cum all over a communal space.  \n\nAre you having a hard time understanding why that would also be a problem? No one needs to be told that this is something that you do not do.  Period.  No one needs to tell you to stop.  If you need to be told that, there is a lot more wrong with everything.", "She also said she replaced it with a tub.", "I have tubs of lotion that can be squeezed and have dents if they are squeezed but they have a wide mouth and no spout. \n\nShe replaced it with a tub, so presuming she replaced it with the same kind of lotion (which is likely, people don\u2019t change up their skin care if it\u2019s working) then there\u2019s a decent chance the original bottle was more scoop like Thant pump like.", "Even then, I\u2019ve seen dudes squeeze too much of something into their hand and then try to suck the excess back up into the tube\u2026 still potential for contamination, lol. Only a pump tube with give me any sort of confidence that it wasn\u2019t contaminated, and only if the lid wasn\u2019t removable \ud83d\ude02", "A lot of them even come with a scoop because they don\u2019t want bacteria from your hands getting in the moisturizer and breeding.", "She's not his parent, it's not her job. I wouldn't have wanted to say anything at that age either.", "It was obviously a joke to me, some people on reddit are absolutely wheelbarrows.", "Oh wow. It\u2019s probably so much worse on lady parts! Have you gotten therapy to deal with the trauma?", "Aren't there a \"urban legend\" that your  dick go green if you are jacking off to much?", "[deleted]", "\u2026They commenter seemed to get it themselves, and they were one of the only people (at least as a comment not a reply and only amongst the limited ones I skimmed via the algorithm) saying what I also thought: she needs to have a conversation with him. I think the notion that \u201cofc a teen male wouldn\u2019t know\u201d only reinforces this notion, not that no one would have to say anything, so fundamentally it sounds like you and I disagree on how something like this would be handled.", "No, it's not her \"job.\"  It I'd a caring thing to do for a sibling and may correct 2 issues that mom is ignoring.    Maturity is sometimes doing things outside of what is required.", "Luckily it was all external\u2026but I\u2019ve not touched a bottle of icy hot since.", "Sorry, you said you were confused and I was trying to clarify what the person was saying."]}
