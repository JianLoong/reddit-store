Yeah. I got chewed out for this a few days ago and just wanna know if I was really TA here.\n\nI (20F) have a younger brother, (15M), who's an absolute pain in the ass to live with in many ways. One of his issues is he completely lacks empathy and will often do things without caring about how others may take it.\n\nOne night, I noticed my bottle of face moisturizer that I keep in the bathroom was facing backwards and in the wrong spot, and had a dent in the bottle like a lot had been squeezed out. Sure enough a lot more was missing than usual, like 1/4 of the product.\n\nThe only two people who use this bathroom are myself, my brother and my mum. I asked my mum if she borrowed some and she said she didn't, and I believe her. She's not a liar and would just tell me if she had.\n\nIt was pretty obvious to me at this point that my brother had used it. I didn't know for what, and thought maybe he just had some dry skin or whatever, but then I realised he might have used it as lotion to jack off in the shower. I know he does this because he's constantly leaving the dried ejaculate on the shower screen. I've never brought it up because eww, but I'm 20, I know what that shit is. And at waist height as well. I think he tries to wash it off but is too lazy to check if he gets all of it. Sure enough, I noticed there was a suspicious streak in the shower that hadn't been there the night before.\n\nI felt super squicky about using that stuff on my face being 90% sure where some of it had gone. I also don't know if he's ever used some before. I ended up throwing the rest away and have bought myself another tub from a different brand that I'm now keeping in my room. My mum found out I threw the bottle away and got mad at me for wasting it. I tried to discreetly explain but she called my actions \"ridiculous\" and said I was just making assumptions. She's still a little salty if I'm honest, even though I paid for the products myself.

(and if i were you, i'd have done that, and also texted him letting him know that was fancy lotion that i'd spent my own money on. if he's embarrassed that you clocked him, he's earned the embarrassment lmao.) \n\nfor my own standards, i would be pretty annoyed, but i wouldn't be squicked. so that's why i think no assholes here, i don't think anybody is \"the asshole\" here. teenagers are gonna do that, and it probably just never occurred to him to think of things like lotion and kleenex and stuff as being limited resources belonging to any one person in the home lmao.", "YTA it's not like it somehow became contaminated even if that was the case", "Ye I probably would have done the same", "INFO: Do you think he out the lotion back in the container after?", "Id leave a (fake) used tampon where he can see it, hang it on his towel rack for more impact", "You win! \ud83c\udfc6", "Regardless of who bought it, if it was hers, and she could replace it, then it's absolutely her prerogative to replace it. Even if the mother, e.g., had given it to her as a gift.", "You could also have just given the rest to your brother and told him. Don't use my stuff again.", "1000% sure no, but 999% sure yes we are hahaha\n\nNTA", "i mean there\u2019s a large chance he touched his nasty bits before reaching for the lotion and depending on the kind of container his nasty dick hands could totally have contaminated the product inside. i hate wasting stuff but my paranoia issues would never let that go", "she shouldn\u2019t have to buy her teenage brother his own jack off lotion to stop him from using hers!! it\u2019s common sense you don\u2019t use other peoples things without asking ESPECIALLY not for sexual purposes. girls do not have to teach boys how to behave.", "Why does anyone need to be told to not jerk off in a shared space using items that don\u2019t belong to you??? That\u2019s common knowledge, unless you yourself are also a male teen.", "But also face moisturizer for that reason Is definitely better than the reg stuff. \ud83e\udd23", "she shouldn\u2019t have to buy her teenage brother his own jack off lotion to stop him from using hers!! it\u2019s common sense you don\u2019t use other peoples things without asking ESPECIALLY not for sexual purposes. it is not her job as his sibling to \u201cteach little bro responsibility\u201d and this idea only serves to perpetuate the idea that boys will be boys and girls must mature faster in order to \u201cteach\u201d the boys and protect themselves. girls do not have to teach boys common decency and respect and we especially do not have to cater to boys\u2019 future partners/roommates or the boys\u2019 own well-being. BOYS are responsible for making themselves good potential roommates/partners and good men in genera. i really hope you can reflect on how saying stuff like this to girls/women is perpetuating misogyny and the patriarchal expectations men have of women to take care of them.", "What sick home did you grow up in? Tf.", "She described the replacement she purchased as being a tub. Which makes me think the replaced was also in a tub. Tubs requiring scooping. Possibly frenzied scooping if OP's suspicions are correct. Frenzilly scooped-from lotion tubs for sure belong in the trash, especially when the scooper is your teenage kid brother. I suppose it could have been offered to said brother but how awkward of an exchange would that be? Nope, toss it. NTA.", "this would have enabled and encouraged the behavior, despite the accompanying compliment, would it have not? regardless, OP def needs to have a conversation with her brother about it not being okay and keeping it in her room now is the best decision she could make as far as recompense (the drawback for him being that there is now less bioavailable lubricant)", "I\u2019d say he\u2019s probably finished more than enough.", "I have a vagina and that made me cover my crotch protectively. YIKES", "In junior high, a buddy told me that Icy-Hot cream was heaven down there. He gave me a small travel-size bottle of it and tells me he has to go take care of something and he\u2019ll be back in 15 minutes. Cut to me running pantsless down his hallway to the guest bathroom (half-bath, no tub or shower) and I\u2019m climbing over the sink trying to get my junk under the faucet\u2026 the burn doesn\u2019t stop no matter how much you rinse. 12 years later and I still feel it.", "hehehehehehehe", "I figured that, if the bottle had a big dent in it, it was probably a squeezy bottle. But if it wasn\u2019t, then fuck that noise because no one wants lotion that\u2019s had dick hands dipped in it!", "OMG, if a $3.00 bottle of Suave lotion helps a kid through an awkward life phase, gets him to clean the spew off the shower curtain, and keeps her good stuff safe... Why wouldn't you?", "in the first half you sound like you\u2019re disagreeing with the comment you replied to, and in the second half you sound like you\u2019re agreeing, leaving me as a reader a little confused about where you were going with your reply", "What is he just ejaculating *fungus* now?? They have bigger fucking issues than sister throwing out a bottle of lotion if that\u2019s the case.", "Right? Every single good moisturizer I own you have to scoop to use it. Not everything is generic aveno.", "probably not judging how he was too lazy to was his literal \"juice\" off the screen. but im not gonna assume, he may have", "+ 1", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Then you don\u2019t spend enough time on the internet, boost those numbers up!!!", "From his brothers junk\u2026 If he\u2019s going in for seconds mid event then he\u2019s leaving bacteria IN the container which then goes on the owners face.", "I\u2019ve noticed lately Reddit is way more weirdly paranoid about germs and shit than the average person. And In the most nonsensical ways. Like fungus? What the fuck is that dude even talking about Lmfao", "Yep mine too. dunno where a 15 yr old boyshands have been. these people have obviously never used a squeeze bottle where has they stop squeezing its Sucked some back in", "She said it was a bottle that she could tell someone had squeezed, how would his hand be getting in there?", "They are going to really freak out when they find out what mushrooms are.", "Specially if he\u2019s so dirty he\u2019s leaving stuff behind on the shower curtain. I\u2019d assume he\u2019s even more disgusting with his personal space and his body. I\u2019d be moving out after giving them both a piece of my mind.", "It all depends on how it\u2019s being grabbed. Are they scrapping the opening on their hand or letting it fall? Are they scooping it out with their finger? Are they not wiping the outside of the bottle afterwards? \n\nI had a super disgusting housemate once and unfortunately I speak from experience.", "I used to lose it on my brother for leaving his mags in the bathroom. He cleaned the mess but wouldfor get his visuals. let alone if e used my good stuff and lefg a mess.", "have you conducted scientific experiments to measure bacteria levels in lotion after use? no? then you can\u2019t say \u201cthere\u2019s no chance\u201d because you do not know that."]}
