She saw a recipe for a Christmas martini that she wanted to bring. I told her about my no alcohol rule. She didn\u2019t say much but must have told the rest of the family. Some of them started texting me asking me if I was serious and saying that it is lame. But I\u2019m not budging. \n\nNow it turns out my husbands sister is hosting an alternate gathering that almost everyone is choosing to go to instead. It\u2019s so disrespectful all because they would have to spend one day sober. \n\nMy husband told me he talked to his sister and we are invited to her gathering and he said we should just go and stop causing issues but I won\u2019t it\u2019s so rude. \n\nNow husband is mad because I\u2019m making him stay home and spend Christmas with me but it was my turn to host and I chose to have a no alcohol they could have dealt with it for one year.", "created_utc": 1669985828, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zalhix/aita_for_banning_alcohol_from_christmas/", "score": 14701, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have any past christmases/events been absolutely ruined because of alcohol? \n\nBy that I mean violence, drama, puking on the floor, whatever? \n\nIf not, this is a pretty strange rule to implement with your husband's family. They have nothing to do with your father being an alcoholic. If my boyfriend told my mother she can't drink wine with her christmas supper I would find that weird as hell.\n\nYTA unless something truly awful happened previously due to alcohol that would explain this.", "Kindly, YTA. I understand where you come from. But you need to understand where other people come from too.\n\nIt's not your wedding or your birthday : this celebration is not about you and your wants. It's a celebration to bring people together.\n\nMost people work hard all year and rarely get to see their family. When they do, they want to relax and celebrate. It sucks, but yes, alcohol is part of this. I get that you don't want to see people dead drunk in your house : but there is an healthy \"a couple of drinks\" in between.", "YTA for a variety of reasons. \n\n1. For unilaterally banning alcohol. It\u2019s presumably your husbands house too so why didn\u2019t you have a discussion with him?\n2. For getting mad that someone else decided to host Christmas after they found out you banned alcohol. An invitation is not a summons and you\u2019re imposing rules a lot of people don\u2019t want to follow on the holidays. \n3. From not allowing your husband to celebrate Christmas with his family. That\u2019s not your decision to make. \n4. For your overall attitude around your ILs and drinking. Having a few drinks for the holidays is okay, it\u2019s not a gross or nasty thing that we should judge.\n\nEdit: It did not occur to me until y\u2019all started commenting that OP was intentionally not telling anyone (her husband included) that it was a dry party to intentionally trick them into coming. Add that as reason #5 YTA.", "YTA for having a fit when no one wants to attend your optional gathering where alcohol is banned because you personally think it's childish. Now all your in-laws know that you think they're immature alcoholics, so why on earth would you expect them to go to your dinner when you think that about them? No less on a holiday where yes, most people expect there to be festive alcoholic drinks served.\n\nI don't even drink at dinners outside my home because I'm always driving home after, but I sure wouldn't attend one like yours. Ya turkey ain't that good.", "YTA and your husband should just go and enjoy his holiday. It would be a great present for you since you seem to love being judge mental", "YTA. You need therapy to deal with issues caused by your dads alcoholism. My dad was an abusive alcoholic, but I would never call others 'childish' or say they need to 'grow up' for drinking. I drink myself. I don't blame them for organising something else. For most, Christmas is the one time of year they can let go and enjoy themselves, YTA for trying to dictate their day.", "YTA.  Sure, you can have a dry party, but your attitude about it is way too judgmental.  It also sounds like you weren't really going to communicate it until the martini recipe came up. \n\nSorry you group up with an alcoholic parent, but your attitude towards others stinks.", "As a non-drinker who also saw my share of alcoholism, I totally understand where you are coming from.\n\nBut unless something very specific has happened that you can point to, or you established up front that you wanted to host alcohol-free gatherings, YTA for making such a major change to the rules and expecting his family to fall in line.   Christmas is not about you--it's about family, friendship, tradition, and celebrating together, and you chose to marry into a family in which alcohol is an integral part of their tradition.   And your childish and  \"it's time to grow up\" comments  are  judgmental and downright sanctimonious.\n\nI almost gave this an E S H because your husband wasn't fully supporting you, but it seems like you didn't actually discuss this rule change with him, and he does have a right to have input into something major like this.", "YTA. Your dislike for alcohol does not erase the fact that a LOT of people drink during the holidays. You can ban alcohol from your gathering but you can not force others to attend. Were you planning on saying anything to them before the event if it wasn\u2019t mentioned by anyone else? Because if not that would\u2019ve been an absolute shit show.", "YTA because you made an executive decision for everyone else and now you're pouting because they found a way around you. That type of behavior is childish as well. You can make rules for your home. You can choose to not drink and not like to be around drinking. Nobody else has to be forced to come in line with your expectations. They are allowed to do as they please, elsewhere.", "YTA. Not even because you banned alcohol but mostly because of your attitude about it. Wanting a drink or two at Christmas is neither childish nor immature.\n\nUnless you guys have a history of alcohol ruining Christmas several times let people enjoy their holidays. And lose your judgy attitude.", "YTA for your attitude and the way you went about this. Ok\u2026 your house, your rules and all so you can ban alcohol from the Christmas celebration you\u2019re hosting if you wish. Your judgmental attitude towards those who chose to drink and your unilateral imposition of your choice on your husband and guests make you TA. \n\nDid you even bother to tell your guests about this alcohol ban ahead of time, or were you planning to announce it when they arrived and it was too late for them to make alternative arrangements?  Because from what you wrote here, it sounds like the ban came as a total surprise to all of those invited, including your own husband, and was only discovered in advance because SIL asked you about a holiday martini recipe she wanted to try. You are free to celebrate however you want, especially when you\u2019re hosting. But they\u2019re free to choose to decline your invitation to host if you\u2019re going to make absurd, unilateral, totalitarian rules like this.  If I were your husband, I would go to the alternative Christmas party and leave you home alone.", "YTA.\n\nWhile it\u2019s your decision, the comments you made about drinking being childish and needing to grow up is where I decided. Just because you have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol doesn\u2019t mean every else needs to. You made a decision about your house, that no one liked so they chose an alternative. Now if you don\u2019t go you\u2019re going to more than likely alienate everyone from you and your husband.", "You're not TA for not wanting to have alcohol. YTA for being mad that people don't let you dictate how they spend their holidays. I don't drink but it wouldn't occur to me to tell my friends/family what they can or can't drink.", "YTA for how you talk about people who enjoy drinking at a party. You\u2019re reasons are valid that yes it is your party so your rules but not if you\u2019re telling them \u201cit\u2019s childish if you can\u2019t not drink at a holiday party.\u201d", "YTA.  It\u2019s one thing to decide *you* don\u2019t want to drink, or to host an alcohol-free party.  It\u2019s another to get all huffy when other people decide that\u2019s not for them and make other plans, *especially* after you\u2019ve gone out of your way to make it clear that your idea of fun and/or adult behavior in no way lines up with theirs.", "YTA and here is my opinion:\nIt\u2019s understandable you have an aversion to alcohol with the upbringing of living with an alcoholic. \n\nIf your in laws are anything like my family and millions others, this isn\u2019t a drunk-fest. This is family coming together for some food and drink during Christmas time. A couple of themed cocktails to go with the meal you are in charge of? Sounds ideal and perfect. \n\nYou are ruining Christmas. Suck it up and apologize. Tell them they can come and explain your reasoning. Tell them you want everyone to be together and have a good time and you were only knee-jerk reacting. \n\nThis could potentially damage your relationship with your husbands family so fix it now. \n\nAnd see a therapist if you can. I\u2019m not be facetious either: a therapist would be able to help you cope with these strong feelings and aversions and come to terms with things from your childhood.", "Honestly you are the rude one. It\u2019s fine to not want to drink but it\u2019s not okay to ruin everyone else\u2019s holiday.", "YTA--mainly for not communicating about this with your husband first and making it clear that this would be a different kind of party. A \"host\" is supposed to make people feel welcome. You are not exactly projecting that vibe in this post at all. Honestly, it seems like someone else should host it and when it gets too rowdy, have a code word with your husband that it's time to go. Then you don't have to be a captive audience to drinking, have to worry about people drinking and driving when they leave your house, etc.\n\nDon't be surprised if those Christmas martinis show up in a flask and people start swapping it on the devil's strip while you're alone inside.", "YTA mostly for your comments about them being childish and also for imposing a no alcohol rule because it's time for them to \"grow up\". What?? I can understand where you're coming from, my husband and I don't drink either. But we're hosting Christmas this year and I'm going to make sure to have at least a bottle of wine for anyone who might want it. Unless all of them have a track record of getting shitfaced and chaotic when they drink, then your rule is pretty unreasonable.", "YTA, they are obeying your rules, there won\u2019t be any drinks at your house, and they are free to go where they want for the holidays. You raising a stink over this is making you an AH. Holidays are one of the few times I can cut loose with a drink and relax, I wouldn\u2019t want to give that up for some judgmental relative either", "I was hovering between N A H and YTA, but I\u2019m going to go with YTA.\n\nThe reason I\u2019d say N A H is because you can set the rules at your house-they can choose not to attend because of it.\n\nHowever, I do think YTA because of your attitudes towards people who drink, your judgmental attitude, for shoving your husband in the middle, and for thinking everyone else is TA because they don\u2019t want to make the same choices you do. You\u2019re banning alcohol because you personally think it\u2019s childish, you\u2019re judging people who drink, and you\u2019re surprised they don\u2019t want to get together with you? Neither would I, and not because you\u2019re not serving alcohol, but because of your snobby, holier-than-thou attitude. You think you\u2019re better than them because you don\u2019t drink-or at the very least, that\u2019s the vibe you\u2019re giving off.\n\nEDIT: to clarify the ruling is YTA.", "YTA and the Grinch who stole boozemas\n\nEdit: Thank you all for awards may you be blessed this boozemas", "YTA\n\nThis isn't because you wanted no alcohol at a gathering in your home, you are allowed to decide this (though you are a bit T A if it wasn't discussed with your husband)\n\nY T A 1) because you apparently didn't tell them this would be a rule before agreeing to host (based on SIL not knowing until she specifically bought alcohol up) and 2) because of your whole take on it and your judgement of other peoples choices. If they aren't alcoholics and wish to enjoy in moderation at Christmas, they are entitled to do that. It doesn't make them childish or disrespectful just because they don't share your views. Childish would be if they chose not to invite you to the alternative arrangements that they had made, but they have.\n\nI do feel sorry for your husband in all of this.", "Does your husband want alcohol? It is his house as well", "YTA.  You don't say that they get sloppy drunk, belligerent, etc.  You just don't like drinking of any sort and want to enforce that on your guests.\n\nMy parents were alcoholics and I only drink occasionally.  I don't usually have it in the house because I just don't think about buying any when I'm out.  I will have beer, wine, or mixed drink when out to dinner or a gathering.  I don't NEED a drink at any time, but I wouldn't turn it down, and I do like a drink at holidays.\n\nIn any case, you are free to set rules in your own home.  The relatives are free to decline the invite and do something else too.", "You get to make choices, but you had better discuss the possible consequences with your spouse before you declare the new  rules, because you might not like the consequences.  \n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.\n\nConsequences happen .  AND 95% of the time , you do not get to choose what those consequences are.", "I do not drink alcohol myself and I still think YTA. Not for wanting to host a dry Christmas, but for your attitude when the rest of the family decides that's not their thing. It is disrespectful of you to demand that others follow your personal preferences and to complain if they don't. Maybe you should grow up and realize the world doesn't revolve around you.", "YTA. It isn\u2019t \u2018childish\u2019 to enjoy drinks with the fam at Christmas. Newsflash: it\u2019s normal. And you already know that your husband\u2019s family enjoys it. So yeah, naturally they prefer a gathering that sounds infinitely more fun to them. They were down to come to your gathering until you decided to refuse an element that they traditionally enjoy together. \n\nYou\u2019re the one who has an issue with alcohol - it has bad associations for you, that\u2019s understandable. But most people who drink aren\u2019t alcoholics. You\u2019re being very judgmental towards them and I\u2019m sure they 100% sense that. That would make me want to do something else, too.", "Your attitude is kinda shitty. There is nothing about having alcohol at a party that makes it childish, and not having alcohol doesn't make a party \"grown up\". And your attitude towards it makes you sound like a prude. \n\nIt's not \"spending one day sober\". These are people who likely spend many days sober. It's not like you or someone who's coming has a problematic relationship with alcohol, it just sounds like you have warped views about it and want to police what others do based on your world views. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Your house, your rules... but I'm not surprised no one's coming over. You're very judgemental of what appears to be a normal, casual part of the family holiday. It's a day for everyone to enjoy and if a few drinks are a part of that, it's not hurting anyone. It doesn't sound like anyone is pressuring you to partake; your issues with alcohol are not their problem.", "YTA\n\nIf those are your house rules then so be it but don't get mad because people are deciding to go over to your SIL house.  If you don't want to attend her celebration that is fine but why are you stopping your husband from going.  \n\nPoor hubby got to be with you all damn day and night.", "YTA\n\nYour attitude towards alcohol isn\u2019t even based on how THEY act when they drink, it\u2019s based on your own personal experience that THEY can\u2019t relate to. It\u2019s like watching the movie Babe and telling everyone that they will be vegan for Christmas even though, traditionally, they are used to having a roast, duck, and turkey. It\u2019s selfish, and no one wants to be told that they can\u2019t have something they are used to around the holidays. Sure it\u2019s one day but it\u2019s a day that people are used to drinking on because it\u2019s a holiday.

It sounds like you didn't talk to your husband about your plans for a dry Christmas, which is your AH move.

It sounds like the one person who has alcohol problems isn't in the picture anymore. This is solely OP's ruined view of healthy consumption- while a valid reason to abstain, it's not reasonable to expect it of anyone else", "Good point but I doubt anything has happened, OP just seems to have a strong personal dislike for alcohol and admitted she thinks it\u2019s childish to drink to enjoy yourself. She even said \u201cIt\u2019s time to grow up.\u201d I think if anything has happened at holidays in the past she would have said so, and that would definitely be a good reason to consider and discuss banning alcohol - especially the puking thing; anytime someone can\u2019t hold their liquor especially at damn Christmas and ruins other peoples\u2019 time by getting sick, it\u2019s time for that to go. But again, this seems like something OP would have, and definitely should have if applicable, mentioned.\n\nIt\u2019s frankly not even clear that anyone gets drunk, OP mentioned multiple bottles of wine and cocktails. This is my family every Christmas, we have multiple bottles of wine and cocktails present, and no one\u2019s ever drunk. Ever. My aunt and uncle always made a festive cocktail for everyone to enjoy - if they want to - every Christmas Eve, its something fun they do. Depending on how many family members there are, \u201cmultiple\u201d bottles of wine may not even mean everyone is having a lot of it. I really think OP just hates alcohol and has some trauma around it.", "Exactly. There's no real way to judge this one without more information. \n\nI have experienced 2 family members thay frankly cannot be tolerated when around alcohol. It ends with them so drunk and picking fights, sometimes physical, hurling insults, behaving bizarrely in front of kids, it's just not safe. \n\nIf thats what's happening a booze free holidays seems the only option. \n\nIf this is all paranoia from having an alcoholic father, that's a far different story.", "It's in the realm of possibility.  My alcoholic father absolutely would get drunk on Christmas and ruin it for everyone.  I want to gag everytime I see pictures from the holidays with him all glassy eyed and red-faced.  My family did ultimately decide to have dry holidays to support my mom, but that was a joint decision, unlike the imperious decision OP made.", "Right! I am not a drinker and never have been. No one in my family drinks and most of our social circle are also non-drinkers. But unless her husband and family are getting so sloshed that it ruins the event, she has no standing to unilaterally decide what grown people can/cannot consume. Now, if they are running into the Christmas tree and drunkenly screaming at each other I will be totally in her court. If not...she needs to unclench and lighten up.

She has trauma and wants to celebrate christmas one time without being reminded of it", "Agreed. I'm afraid YTA, OP. You're imposing your own beliefs onto others, and it's their decision if they don't want to abide by your rules and celebrate the holiday in the way that they prefer. Just because you don't drink alcohol and had a bad experience with an alcoholic father doesn't mean that everyone who likes to consume alcohol is \"childish\" (weird choice of words, OP). Even if you think it's rude, please don't ruin the holiday for your husband.", "This is a good point. Christmas is not a time to uplift or celebrate one person. realizing this is an ironic sentence due to the origin of Christmas but anyway. OP is not supposed to be the centre of attention here", "This is the best point.  I  grew up with an alcoholic parent.  I've gone to many celebrations and been the designated driver.  I would never tell other people what they can and cannot do.  The only exception is no smoking in my house. That stinks up the whole place.\n\nJust because someone enjoys a few drinks doesn't make them an alcoholic.  If you have more specific concerns about your husband's drinking habits you should address those with him in a private setting.", "Agree. While OP absolutely has the right to an alcohol free environment in her own home, other people also have the right to opt out of that event if they don\u2019t like it.

They sound like they have a couple glasses of wine/cocktails and enjoy themselves.

It\u2019s presumably your husbands house too so why didn\u2019t you have a discussion with him?\n\nThis is the major issue, IMO.  She's allowed to feel whatever piety she wants about alcohol,  but not discussing this the other person who lives there is extraordinarily selfish and entitled.", "It also sounds like the family didn't even know it was banned until SIL called OP to see what she could bring and was then told she wasn't allowed to bring her stuff for the martini, which makes the OP a major AH IMO if she couldn't have said something to everyone from the get go.", " Number 3 is the biggest point for me.

Because people like to drink alcohol at parties. My personal level of consumption (exactly zero these days) is irrelevant.", "OP sounds a lot like a control freak I dated when I was young and stupid.  If the girl saw anyone have more than one drink in a sitting, she would go off the rails screaming about how that person was an alcoholic and needed help.  She came was a very sheltered religious family.  OP sounds like they have a severely skewed view of reality.  Definitely YTA.", "Yup. An invitation is not a summons. \n\nHey OP, you want to know a very good way to make people want to attend your optional celebratory event? Allow people to celebrate.

On the fucking prehistoric landscape.

It sounds like she wasn't planning on saying anything and just magically expecting everyone to know? She only told the sister when sis specifically asked about bringing a cocktail.

You said this best.  I'd also add that everyone, especially people who lived with alcoholics, have to try to NOT control others as well...it's the basis of living a sane and drama-free life.  Trying to control others only leads to resentment on everyone's part.  And also try Alanon or Adult Children of Alcoholics.

My family has never had alcohol at our gatherings, we're just not big drinkers. Of course it's possible to have fun without drinking, we do it every year, but it's not what this family has come to expect from Christmas, and that's ok.

It really changes the tone. If that was the case, like obviously we'd all be more sympathetic, but if the inlaws enjoy a festive libation and a few bottles of wine spread over 8 to 12 adults (an average of 1-3 glasses over an entire evening) it really isn't the same thing as \"they're alcoholics who binge drink and destroy everything.\"", "*sad breakfast", "And that is what recovery is.
