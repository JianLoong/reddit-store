Like this is not for you dude, fuck off. If you wouldn't interrupt a straight couple kissing or stare and act all creepy and horny at them what makes it ok when two fem ppl do it? What's worse is you weren't even kissing your friend in a romantic manner and this dude wants to turn your platonic kiss into his own personal porn? That guy is not a friend, that's a dude acting friendly up until the moment he forces you to make it apparent in some way that you're not going to sleep with him, when he will show you who he really is.
