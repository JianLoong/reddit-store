Here he apologized and said that he was just horsing around and that I should expect people to crack jokes at us kissing one another.

If you say \"no\" it creates a hostile environment and you're a bitch ruining the mood, if you hug him, he gets to press up against you, getting his way. But you can call these people out for the third outcome, they look like a creep and it's THEM that ruined the mood. Never give in to these people, they will use your kindness against you.", "NTA. \n\nThat sounds super creepy and not at all like 'horsing around'.\n\nI would be pleased about him not talking to you.\n\nOf course, we cant really know his intentions, but it really doesnt look good.", "NTA.

You called him out (well done). He doubled down. \n\nIf he\u2019s a true friend he\u2019ll go off and think about this and come back with a genuine apology.

And he stopped, though it took more than one request, and apologized. . I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re holding on to this so hard. Trust me when I say there are far worse creep out moments that come from almost nowhere, than this.

I said there are far worse moments (that friend you already know may creep you out). This has zip to do with women/men, and a whole lot of knowing someone well, and them saying 1/2 sentences of creepy stuff. I\u2019m saying if you know someone well, and the say something stupid, that you should not judged that person for a sentence or 2, especially if they\u2019re drunk.
