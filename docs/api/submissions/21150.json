And affected them too. Calling him out in this case wasn't just about him, but to show the rest of the friendgroup, the men in particular, that they wouldn't allow that behaviour to fly. If you can't take correction or crticism  in front of others due to your ego, and you need it coddled to listen to someone, in your friendgroup, that's probably something you should work on, honestly.", "How does making an innocent joke make you not HUMAN WHILE BEING DRUNK", "I need you to stop, your comments are making me SUPER uncomfy as it sounds like you're excusing sexual misconduct and gating it off as \"if someone feels that way then that is the case\". And before you say anything disrespectful or snide, this is how I MYSELF am feeling- harassed and creeped out.. so please stop talking.. if you continue like this, you're just a SA apologist hypocrite", "Op making fun of religion", "You sound like a creep. She was too harsh on the creep? Boohoo. And no she wasn\u2019t. If he\u2019s religious then apologising to their god Is something that they do", "So she\u2019s an ah for not accepting an apology? In what world", "Probably a lot tbh", "She\u2019s entitled to not accept an apology. YTA for being that person that thinks everyone has to accept an apology. I bet if you were a teacher you\u2019d make victims shake hands with their bullies if they gave half assed apologies", "The thing is that some guys have a charisma or attractiveness or something (I don\u2019t have it) that lets them go through life making exactly the same comments, and not having it perceived as creepy.  They\u2019re seen as flirty or fun or whatever. \n\nI suspect that women in that or a similar situation would find it creepy if I said something like that, even if I intended it to be funny.  So I  don\u2019t, because who wants to make other people feel uncomfortable.  \n\nBut it\u2019s frustrating to see other guys do it get rewarded.", "Well it creeped her and her friend out , so it sure wasn\u2019t funny in their minds, being made the butt of a sexual joke.", "Where does she say she expects him to still talk to her?", "When did she insult him? Are you referring to her calling him a creep? Cos that\u2019s an appropriate title giving  his behaviour", "I dunno about American culture, I'm British. I know enough French and Luxembourgish people that cheek-kissing seems normal to me, though.", "\"an offensive slur\"\n\nAre you American by any chance?", "As I said, then every adult person in this world is a creep.", "What she did wasn\u2019t sexual. He turned it sexual. Sexualising", "Okay creep"]}
