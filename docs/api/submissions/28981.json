You are still acting immature by not accepting you were in the wrong. It's funny your wife is 12 years younger and more mature than you. Maybe you should have shot even younger to find someone with a similar maturity level.", "Yeah you gotta run plans by the SO when renovating a shared space. I've been out of town to come back to rearranged furniture and a rearranged garage and I was pissed at the wife for it.

A very important rule of living with a woman, whether you're married or not: don't mess with anything that might be considered redecorating or renovating any part of the house without consulting her.

Misogynistic as hell", "YTA. Your wife agreed to you remodeling the den, not the whole bedroom. And you say \"den,\" as if it's a separate room off the bedroom? So why did they have to match?\n\nYou should've stuck to the orig plan, and if you still the rooms didn't \"match\" wait for you wife to come home to decide what to do.\n\nApologize to your wife and change the room back, at your own expense.", "And he thinks his wife was \u201crude\u201d LOL\n\nYTA", "First world problems\u2026", "Yta in every way.
