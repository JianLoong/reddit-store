Anna has a two year old son, who also happens to be my godson. I love him to absolute death and I have since the day he was born. Anna and the father aren't together (one night stand situation) but they are extremely good co-parents. I don't know much about the father, but they're both in the Air Force and have to report to drill one weekend of every month. Anna gets her drill schedule in advanced so I can help her out with my godson when she's not home and so I could also drive her to her drill (she doesn't have her license). I also will watch him for her if she goes out since I'm a homebody and too tired to join her whenever I get home from work.  \n\nA few weeks ago I found out that my grandfather who lives in Italy was diagnosed with brain cancer, and this is going to be his last Christmas. I was always very close with my grandfather, but he moved out of the states when I turned 20, and due to the pandemic I haven't been able to see him. I decided to book a last minute trip to go to Italy for a month and a half since I was able to get paid family leave from my job and my grandfathers health is deteriorating rapidly. \n\nI informed Anna the night (Dec. 7th) I booked my flight that I would be leaving to see my grandfather. She immediately became enraged and telling me that I would be interfering with both of her drill weekends for December and January. I apologized to her and tried explaining the situation, but she continued to call me selfish for not letting her know (or as she says, keep her in the loop). I acknowledged that this was completely last minute, and asked if my godson's father could help in anyway. She exploded on me again, telling me that he's a loser and wants nothing to do with him, and that he's the reason she's a so called \"mess\". \n\nAs much as I tried to explain to her that I understand I agreed to help out with her son, my own family comes first. She then proceeded to call me a horrible friend for not helping her, especially since she will have a week long drill in January while I am away.

She's calling YOU self centered because you want to go see your dying grandfather and cant watch her kid?! She can find alternate care, you've given plenty of notice.

That child is BOTH of their responsibilities and shouldn\u2019t be dumped onto you because they had a one night stand.", "NTA. Anna has entitled parent syndrome. Since you normally babysit whenever she wants you to, she now feels entitled to your time. That's ridiculous. Her child is her child and she is responsible, not you. Go see your grandfather without any guilt because you don't owe Anna child care and taxi service. She's going to have to grow up and figure it out herself for a month.", "She's not learning how to multitask or any coping mechanisms in the military. NTA. You don't actually have a child - Anna does. And I'm sorry for her childcare needs. Truly. But she has resources at her disposal if she's in the Air Force. Besides she also has an actual co parent she can turn to.

So YOU are horrible because you make her life harder !!!!! She totally forgot the time you helped her out and babysit I assume for free . Her kid her responsibility !!! Did she really assume you have NO life on your own and you are at her service to make her life easy ? Who makes your life easy ? What is she doing for you in return ? She calls you selfish when she benefited from your kindness and expect you to serve her whenever she needs it !!! She should have been thankful that you helped you out insteed she is greedy and needy and only cares about herself and doesn't care that it could be your grandpas last christmas its all about MEMEMEM what about MEMEMEME . . She has to figure something out but it is not your problem you are not the kids mom", "NTA, and yikes.\n\nI understand that her situation is complicated and probably very frustrating, and that you being away for several weeks puts her in a bit of a pickle.

You've already gone above and beyond what most people would do for a friend.", " NTA.  Your friend sounds like a woman whose life you've become entwined with than a genuine friend.

What\u2019s making her life harder is the one-nighstand she had with the \u2018loser\u2019 and she didn\u2019t think of using protection. Sure you\u2019ve  agreed to help her out, but that was when you thought you had the time. Turns out you can\u2019t do it which you told her as soon as you could and decided you will be flying over to your grandfather. Her reaction is just gross. Pretty much as if she\u2019s just using you as a free baby sitter tbh, because what kind of friend doesn\u2019t get it, that someone\u2019s own family is more important to them, especially at a time like that. You did the right thing by booking the flight, you would be really sorry if you couldn\u2019t meet him before he goes.

What your friend was, was way out of line.

And to remind her that you're a good friend and a good godparent and in no way deserved the way she went off on you.", "NTA - you're helping and that's great.

Go be with your grandpa and let her have her tantrum.", "NTA-sounds like she needs to get her life together", "NTA\n\nA good friend will be grateful when you help them but understand when you can't. \n\nShe sounds like she *expects* you to help her and is *angry* when you can't. \n\nLike, are you supposed to schedule your grandpa's sickness? She's being super selfish and needs a wake-up call and should learn to be appreciative because clearly you've been a great friend.", "NTA. Being a Godparent has absolutely nothing to do with being a free babysitter. You owe this woman nothing. \n\nPlease see your Grandfather and cherish your last moments with him. Don\u2019t even think about her. Put your family first. Good luck to you.", "NTA. She is NOT your friend, she thinks you owe her free childcare and that her needs are more important than yours.

Like you said, your family comes first.", "NTA. You do more than most friends. You're an AMAZING help to her with her kid, you just can't right now and she has to make other arrangements. Your own family comes first right now. Her missing a couple of drill weekends or needing to sort other childcare is nothing compared to you missing a family members last Christmas. Sorry you're going through that, and I hope your Christmas with your family is as nice as it can be", "NTA. She's just pissed you're taking away the free child care and she'll have to step up and manage it for herself somehow. \n\nYou told her right after making the decision and booking the flights, and I presume you'd talked about your grandfather's illness as well. She can find a sitter for a couple of weeks without guilting you over it. \n\nFrankly, I'd tell her that a good friend would want me to go see my dying grandfather and to be with him.", "Wow that is not your friend. Your grandpa is sick and this is the last time you will see him. She should understand that this is more important than her son. You already have done so much for her. She can figure something out herself. Enjoy your time with your grandpa and make some nice last memories.", "NTA, of course! It\u2019s not your kid and finding childcare is not your responsibility.
