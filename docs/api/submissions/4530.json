Anna and the father aren't together (one night stand situation) but they are extremely good co-parents. I don't know much about the father, but they're both in the Air Force and have to report to drill one weekend of every month. Anna gets her drill schedule in advanced so I can help her out with my godson when she's not home and so I could also drive her to her drill (she doesn't have her license). I also will watch him for her if she goes out since I'm a homebody and too tired to join her whenever I get home from work.  \n\nA few weeks ago I found out that my grandfather who lives in Italy was diagnosed with brain cancer, and this is going to be his last Christmas. I was always very close with my grandfather, but he moved out of the states when I turned 20, and due to the pandemic I haven't been able to see him. I decided to book a last minute trip to go to Italy for a month and a half since I was able to get paid family leave from my job and my grandfathers health is deteriorating rapidly. \n\nI informed Anna the night (Dec. 7th) I booked my flight that I would be leaving to see my grandfather. She immediately became enraged and telling me that I would be interfering with both of her drill weekends for December and January. I apologized to her and tried explaining the situation, but she continued to call me selfish for not letting her know (or as she says, keep her in the loop). I acknowledged that this was completely last minute, and asked if my godson's father could help in anyway. She exploded on me again, telling me that he's a loser and wants nothing to do with him, and that he's the reason she's a so called \"mess\". \n\nAs much as I tried to explain to her that I understand I agreed to help out with her son, my own family comes first. She then proceeded to call me a horrible friend for not helping her, especially since she will have a week long drill in January while I am away.

That child is BOTH of their responsibilities and shouldn\u2019t be dumped onto you because they had a one night stand.", "NTA. Anna has entitled parent syndrome. Since you normally babysit whenever she wants you to, she now feels entitled to your time. That's ridiculous. Her child is her child and she is responsible, not you. Go see your grandfather without any guilt because you don't owe Anna child care and taxi service.

You don't actually have a child - Anna does. And I'm sorry for her childcare needs. Truly. But she has resources at her disposal if she's in the Air Force.

So YOU are horrible because you make her life harder !!!!! She totally forgot the time you helped her out and babysit I assume for free . Her kid her responsibility !!!

She calls you selfish when she benefited from your kindness and expect you to serve her whenever she needs it !!! She should have been thankful that you helped you out insteed she is greedy and needy and only cares about herself and doesn't care that it could be your grandpas last christmas its all about MEMEMEM what about MEMEMEME . . She has to figure something out but it is not your problem you are not the kids mom", "NTA, and yikes.\n\nI understand that her situation is complicated and probably very frustrating, and that you being away for several weeks puts her in a bit of a pickle.

Turns out you can\u2019t do it which you told her as soon as you could and decided you will be flying over to your grandfather. Her reaction is just gross. Pretty much as if she\u2019s just using you as a free baby sitter tbh, because what kind of friend doesn\u2019t get it, that someone\u2019s own family is more important to them, especially at a time like that.

She's being super selfish and needs a wake-up call and should learn to be appreciative because clearly you've been a great friend.", "NTA. Being a Godparent has absolutely nothing to do with being a free babysitter. You owe this woman nothing. \n\nPlease see your Grandfather and cherish your last moments with him.

Like you said, your family comes first.", "NTA. You do more than most friends. You're an AMAZING help to her with her kid, you just can't right now and she has to make other arrangements. Your own family comes first right now. Her missing a couple of drill weekends or needing to sort other childcare is nothing compared to you missing a family members last Christmas. Sorry you're going through that, and I hope your Christmas with your family is as nice as it can be", "NTA. She's just pissed you're taking away the free child care and she'll have to step up and manage it for herself somehow. \n\nYou told her right after making the decision and booking the flights, and I presume you'd talked about your grandfather's illness as well. She can find a sitter for a couple of weeks without guilting you over it. \n\nFrankly, I'd tell her that a good friend would want me to go see my dying grandfather and to be with him.", "Wow that is not your friend. Your grandpa is sick and this is the last time you will see him. She should understand that this is more important than her son. You already have done so much for her. She can figure something out herself. Enjoy your time with your grandpa and make some nice last memories.", "NTA, of course! It\u2019s not your kid and finding childcare is not your responsibility.

If this is how she wants to treat you after all the good you've done then she would not be a friend anymore - if she ever really was.", "NTA", "NTA - this is crazy.  She is acting you like are a parent with parental responsibilities and not a friend helping her out.", "She using you. She he unprotected sex and not your responsibility", "NTA  it is her and the child's father's problem, not yours.. you were already being a great friend and godmother..", "NTA \n\nYour \u2018friend\u2019 somehow thinks you should rate her family\u2019s needs higher than your own. \n\nSome friend, huh?", "This should be on r/entitledparents", "Never watch her child again, if you make her life so much harder. Good riddance. NTA. And sorry about your grandfather.", "NTA she has gotten addicted to free child care. Think it's time to cut off the supply.", "NTA, you\u2019re not her spouse. She needs to widen her support network and figure out plans b & c for childcare arrangement.", "What? Your family member is literally dying. No, NTA, and it sounds like this \"friend\" needs an attitude adjustment if she solely relies on you always saying yes to babysit HER kid.\nIf you miss your grandfather's end of life, you will regret it forever and probably resent your friend. Please do go to Italy", "NTA but wow that friendship would be dead to me. Hope you get rid of the toxic person in your life.", "NTA. Your friend is acting extremely ungrateful and out of line.", "She is entitled and not your friend. She is using you. NTA and either fall back from her or cut her loose.", "NTA. I'm very sorry about your grandfather, and hope you get to have a lovely time with him.\n\nBut I will say, even if you had decided to spontaneously go on just a \"me\" vacation, your friend would still be in the wrong, the fact that you're visiting your ailing, dying grandfather... That she would open her mouth to say *anything* other than \"I'm sorry that's happening, it's so good you get to go to him\"...\n\nGurl, this is not a friend, this is just **not**. She thinks you're selfish for not wanting to care for **her** child.\n\nMake plans to leave this situation ASAP, it will get nastier by the second.", "She should of kept her legs closed if she can't handle kids.  They're aren't your problem.  Regardless of her issues", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nYour grandfather comes first.  You need to see him before he passes on.  Tell Anna to fuck off and find a sitter.  She's using you as a sitter even though you love your godson but you need to see your grandfather and spent more time with him.  Just go to Italy and stay with him and rest of family.....be damned to Anna.", "NTA. Not your kid, not your problem. You have been saving her thousands in childcare. She should be grateful. She needs to talk to his kid\u2019s dad and both as parents find a solution.", "NTA... I wish you hadn't wasted your breathe making justifications.  \"I'm going to see a dying relative, I will be gone from this day to that. \nI realize this is last minute but how you will manage to cover your child care is not something I need to think about while I'm coping with my family emergency.\"\n\nI am worried that she has placed you in a parental role because of your living situation.  Make sure to undo this when you get home. Dont let her presume, have her ask about your availability for certain dates and take on less. You are not co-parents, you could get hurt by her manipulative behavior", "NTA! So she expects you to put babysitting HER child over seeing your grandad for the last time. clearly someone thinks the world revolves around them (and its not you). I would refuse to babysit at all in future or drive her anywhere since it clearly hasnt been appreciated.", "NTA \n\nHer son is not actually your responsibility. You are not the third parent, and she needs a reminder of that.", "COMPLETELY NTA!\n\nI get that she has been counting on (take for granted) the care and transportation you provide her. She forgets that it has been out of the kindness of your heart and your sense of friendship. I also get that you change of plans puts her in a bind. HOWEVER, (1) she always needed to have a backup plan - what if you were sick, in a car accident, etc? and (2) she still has time to make plans for the December weekend and the January week.\n\nIf she had been just upset and worried about making those arrangements, I would have said n-a-h. But for her to think that taking care of her needs is your first and only obligation, to call you self-centered and a horrible friend, to say that you are making her life 10x harder... that makes her a full on ahole.\n\nI noticed that she blames the one-night stand for making her a 'mess'. So, let's see. She doesn't take any responsibility for the fact that she had a one-night stand and got pregnant. She blames a guy who was in her life for one night for her being a mess. She refuses to work with the dad to solve this, who (by your description) she has had a good co-parenting relationship with. And she blames you and insults you for not keeping your life centered around her needs and making her life 10x harder, despite all that you've done for her. Sorry but she does not sound like such a great friend if that's how she thinks.\n\nShe may have some other stress that is adding to her horrible reaction. If so, she needs to own that, apologize for her mean words to you, and focus on getting her backup plan in place. You have your own things to focus on. Maybe your time abroad will be good for both of you - allow you to get some perspective and give her a renewed appreciation for all that you do for her.\n\nFor now, your focus is on your time with your granddad.", "Wtfffff she\u2019s getting free rides and baby sitting? NTA and she\u2019s clearly not your friend", "Until she genuinely apologizes, I wouldn\u2019t even speak to her. She is not a friend anymore. This could be your grandfathers LAST Christmas and all she\u2019s thinking about is me, me, me. While you are gone, I would block her from everything cause you don\u2019t need that kind of stress while visiting your grandfather. Send her a last text before you do like \n\n\u201cI love you and love your son. Because of that love, I have done a lot of things for you without wanting anything in return. Now my family is going through something and how do you react? You tell me I\u2019m self centered?! How dare you! If I\u2019m such a terrible friend, maybe we don\u2019t need to talk for awhile. I\u2019m not sure if I can forgive you for everything you said to me, but we can talk after I get back.\u201d\n\nSomething like this.", "NTA. OP, I would text your friend, \"I heard you loud and clear that you were counting on me to watch your child, regardless of my family emergency. I've realized that it's not fair for you to depend on me for all of your support and that it will hurt our relationship if I ever have a life outside of when you need me. Therefore, I will no longer be babysitting your child for any reason, and I'll no longer be giving you rides. I want to make this clear very now, so you can make arrangements for a regular sitter for BLANK, and arrange Ubers when you need them.\"\n\nOP, you've been helping this woman out a lot, and she doesn't seem to appreciate it at all. It's clear when she needs you, you have to be there, but when you need her, she isn't going to be there for you. This is not a friendship. No matter when you put up a boundary, she was going to freak, so it's better you do it now. I BET one day you'll tell her no again, and she'll never let you see her kid again (after moving out). Keep in mind she can do that.", "sorry, but this made me laugh.  To goffer is to emboss something, usually the edges of a book, you were looking for gofer.\n\n\"Watch my kid, take me to work, and put a design on the pages of my journal!\"", "> parasite,\n\nThis, this is the appropriate word.  Instead of being grateful to OP for all the help she already gets with babysitting AND being driven, she explodes on OP as if it's OP's problem that the father is a loser and the reason why she's such a mess.  What an ungrateful parasite.", "I had a \"friend\" divorced w teenager. She asked if I wanted to get a place with her. I said no. She kept asking for 2 yrs. Her son has behavior issues and at 15 would bug her when she was on the phone like he was 5. \n\nShe heats up frozen food and I cook food. People generally expect to eat when someone else cooks and teenagers eat more and often don't think about others \n\nEven if I'd been interested She wanted to live in outer suburbs and I'm 15 min from moat things I need but would've been 45 min/1hr from some of them so there was no reason I'd do that \n\nI assumed she'd want a 3 bedroom place but to pay half the rent and utilities and that she wanted someone to help with her kid. The last time she asked and I said no, she said her parents were the most responsible adults she knew. I thought it was nuts she expected anyone else to take care of her kid. There's no other reason responsibility would come up.\n\nNote that she never mentioned wanting help with the kid which I thought was implied from her comments about the ex not doing anything and she had to drive him for visitation because he didn't drive \n\nI'm still shocked she kept asking. I'd mentioned a few things about my apartment I didn't like and she took it as wanting to move; even. If that were true, I still wouldn't want to have roommates or live somewhere inconvenient. She had another friend she kept asking who also said no.", "Without checking with said bestie/godmother", "I think her plan b is....just bully OP til she gives in and does the plan A the mother wanted all along.\n\nOP missing the final days of a close family member is a price that mother is prepared to pay to have smooth childcare arrangements /s", "OP says in her post that both parents are in the Air Force.", "I've never made a FCP so I have absolutely no idea whether consent is required. I would hope so but I was not a mother when I was in the military and the guard or reserves or whatever this is might be different regardless. But failure to be able to conduct military duties as a result of not having child care is a no go. If the dad of the baby is in the same unit they very well could deploy together if they get activated. \n\nIts equally possible that the true FCP is that the baby goes to the grandparents but they don't live close enough for a weekend so she just dumps her kid on the godmother. But ime with godparents, theyre the person who takes your kid if you die so honestly it could go either way. \n\nShitty situation all around.", "Damn shots fired!", "Yup. AF Guard. 1 weekend a month drill OP mentions. It's different that enlisted and even more so than reserves. But the Guard doesn't have daycare assistance available (stateside, US) anyway.

Or the other available parent, family, or friend support structure.", "Really contributing right here, Sherlock \ud83d\ude12", "I would think you'd have to have consent because the same thing would happen as here, mom is depending on OP, who had no idea. She babysitting a lot but for her friend to point out the week-long January drill gave me the impression she hadn't mentioned it was a week before that. \n\nIf baby daddy is with same unit they should both have child care arrangements in place, not just depend on OP. If not, baby daddy should have kid on drill weekend", "Ah interesting. I was only aware of the National Guard.", "Saying \"you might regret it\" is fine.
