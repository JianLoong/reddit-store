Anna has a two year old son, who also happens to be my godson. I love him to absolute death and I have since the day he was born. Anna and the father aren't together (one night stand situation) but they are extremely good co-parents. I don't know much about the father, but they're both in the Air Force and have to report to drill one weekend of every month. Anna gets her drill schedule in advanced so I can help her out with my godson when she's not home and so I could also drive her to her drill (she doesn't have her license). I also will watch him for her if she goes out since I'm a homebody and too tired to join her whenever I get home from work.  \n\nA few weeks ago I found out that my grandfather who lives in Italy was diagnosed with brain cancer, and this is going to be his last Christmas. I was always very close with my grandfather, but he moved out of the states when I turned 20, and due to the pandemic I haven't been able to see him. I decided to book a last minute trip to go to Italy for a month and a half since I was able to get paid family leave from my job and my grandfathers health is deteriorating rapidly. \n\nI informed Anna the night (Dec. 7th) I booked my flight that I would be leaving to see my grandfather. She immediately became enraged and telling me that I would be interfering with both of her drill weekends for December and January. I apologized to her and tried explaining the situation, but she continued to call me selfish for not letting her know (or as she says, keep her in the loop). I acknowledged that this was completely last minute, and asked if my godson's father could help in anyway. She exploded on me again, telling me that he's a loser and wants nothing to do with him, and that he's the reason she's a so called \"mess\". \n\nAs much as I tried to explain to her that I understand I agreed to help out with her son, my own family comes first. She then proceeded to call me a horrible friend for not helping her, especially since she will have a week long drill in January while I am away.

That child is BOTH of their responsibilities and shouldn\u2019t be dumped onto you because they had a one night stand.", "NTA. Anna has entitled parent syndrome. Since you normally babysit whenever she wants you to, she now feels entitled to your time. That's ridiculous. Her child is her child and she is responsible, not you. Go see your grandfather without any guilt because you don't owe Anna child care and taxi service. She's going to have to grow up and figure it out herself for a month.", "She's not learning how to multitask or any coping mechanisms in the military. NTA. You don't actually have a child - Anna does. And I'm sorry for her childcare needs. Truly. But she has resources at her disposal if she's in the Air Force. Besides she also has an actual co parent she can turn to.

Anna needs to find more people to be available for babysitting, one person is not enough in the long run.", "It\u2019s not selfish for you to leave due to a family emergency.

So YOU are horrible because you make her life harder !!!!! She totally forgot the time you helped her out and babysit I assume for free . Her kid her responsibility !!! Did she really assume you have NO life on your own and you are at her service to make her life easy ? Who makes your life easy ? What is she doing for you in return ? She calls you selfish when she benefited from your kindness and expect you to serve her whenever she needs it !!! She should have been thankful that you helped her out insteed she is greedy and needy and only cares about herself and doesn't care that it could be your grandpas last christmas its all about MEMEMEM what about MEMEMEME . . She has to figure something out but it is not your problem you are not the kids mom", "NTA, and yikes.\n\nI understand that her situation is complicated and probably very frustrating, and that you being away for several weeks puts her in a bit of a pickle.

You've already gone above and beyond what most people would do for a friend.", " NTA.  Your friend sounds like a woman whose life you've become entwined with than a genuine friend.

What\u2019s making her life harder is the one-nighstand she had with the \u2018loser\u2019 and she didn\u2019t think of using protection. Sure you\u2019ve  agreed to help her out, but that was when you thought you had the time. Turns out you can\u2019t do it which you told her as soon as you could and decided you will be flying over to your grandfather. Her reaction is just gross. Pretty much as if she\u2019s just using you as a free baby sitter tbh, because what kind of friend doesn\u2019t get it, that someone\u2019s own family is more important to them, especially at a time like that. You did the right thing by booking the flight, you would be really sorry if you couldn\u2019t meet him before he goes.

And to remind her that you're a good friend and a good godparent and in no way deserved the way she went off on you.", "NTA - you're helping and that's great.

Go be with your grandpa and let her have her tantrum.", "NTA-sounds like she needs to get her life together", "NTA\n\nA good friend will be grateful when you help them but understand when you can't. \n\nShe sounds like she *expects* you to help her and is *angry* when you can't. \n\nLike, are you supposed to schedule your grandpa's sickness? She's being super selfish and needs a wake-up call and should learn to be appreciative because clearly you've been a great friend.", "NTA. Being a Godparent has absolutely nothing to do with being a free babysitter. You owe this woman nothing. \n\nPlease see your Grandfather and cherish your last moments with him. Don\u2019t even think about her. Put your family first. Good luck to you.", "NTA. She is NOT your friend, she thinks you owe her free childcare and that her needs are more important than yours.

Like you said, your family comes first.", "NTA. You do more than most friends. You're an AMAZING help to her with her kid, you just can't right now and she has to make other arrangements. Your own family comes first right now. Her missing a couple of drill weekends or needing to sort other childcare is nothing compared to you missing a family members last Christmas. Sorry you're going through that, and I hope your Christmas with your family is as nice as it can be", "NTA. She's just pissed you're taking away the free child care and she'll have to step up and manage it for herself somehow. \n\nYou told her right after making the decision and booking the flights, and I presume you'd talked about your grandfather's illness as well. She can find a sitter for a couple of weeks without guilting you over it. \n\nFrankly, I'd tell her that a good friend would want me to go see my dying grandfather and to be with him.", "Wow that is not your friend. Your grandpa is sick and this is the last time you will see him. She should understand that this is more important than her son. You already have done so much for her. She can figure something out herself. Enjoy your time with your grandpa and make some nice last memories.", "NTA, of course! It\u2019s not your kid and finding childcare is not your responsibility.

What if you were sick or unable to watch him? Life happens and she needs to have alternative options at the ready in case one of her plans fall through.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. You told her what's up. But agreeing to help with her son doesn't mean putting your life on hold. NTA", "NTA. How is she going to to cope when you want to move out? Or is she expecting you to put your life on hold and co-parent until the kid turns 18? I'd suggest making plans to remove yourself from this situation as soon as you get back from Italy. This is not your child and she needs to take responsibility for him as a single parent.", "Hon\n\nYou need to start setting boundaries.\n\nHe is not your kid. She is responsible for childcare not you. If she breaks the friendship because of this, she is not your friend. To you, your family comes first. \n\nYou have taken on more than you need to, you have been a good friend but she is turning into an entitled ahole \n\nNta", "NTA...what the hell is her problem? Your grandfather is dying. She is so selfish putting her needs over yours. You need to set her straight or get a new roommate or move out. SHE hot pregnant...not you. The child is HER RESPONSIBILITY...not yours. The fact you are such a big help is great but does not entitle her to ANYTHING. Honestly i am appalled by her reaction...this is no friend. You go no matter what to your grandfather and take as much time as you need. Sorry to hear.", "NTA and she's wild AF.  What's her plan?  She's in the military.  What if she gets deployed?  Are you supposed to raise her kid?  What if something happens to you and you're not available, like an illness, accident, or FAMILY EMERGENCY?\n\nYou should get out of this situation.", "NTA. Might as well ask her when she'll marry you if she expects you to be her childs mom too. \n\nIf anything it sounds like your roomie has been using you as a co-parent with none of the benefits. Kind of abusive honestly. She needs a reality check.", "NTA, there are resources for your friend for childcare through the military.", "NTA - You're having a family emergency. She needs a plan b. She also needs to learn to drive. If she's fit for military service, she's capable of learning to drive and obtaining her license. She has enough notice to find alternate arrangements, and it should not be this dramatic. She's relying on you more like a second parent than a godparent, and you'll both be a lot better able to deal with your lives if she knocks that off. Set some boundaries and expectations now. If she can't deal with them, she's using you more than being your friend.", "NTA. WOW. I'd completely cut her ass off. This is not your child or responsibility.", "NTA- this is her responsibility and you have given her notice. It is annoying and hard for your friend but you are doing too much already to be called babysitting", "Most importantly OP, how are you? You are in a tough situation and I hope you and your family finds comfort and closure within the next few months... I do not know you OP, but I am aware that your situation is difficult. You are a stranger to me but this is what common courtesy is. No, your friend is your best friends right? You should have expected and gotten more support from her. However, you did not. I always say this. Look at your relationships. You should be getting as much as you are receiving. In your case, you have put a lot into your relationship, but your best friend has not. If the roles were reversed, your friend would not care for you. She has made poor choices and are expecting you to help her solve them or deal with them. Also, how can you be in the air force and not have a license... You need to remove yourself from this toxic relationship, OP.", "Omg. Is that why people are called gophers? It\u2019s actually goffer??", "You are actually making things too easy for her", "Honestly she can figure it out for herself from here on out. Someone who expects you to put themselves above your dying grandfather is no friend at all. Especially when you've been so good to her already. \n\nI'd seriously reconsider helping her at all after this"]}
