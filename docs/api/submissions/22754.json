This is so stupid but she's upset with me and I want to know if she's being ridiculous.\n\nMy girlfriend 'Ellie' (17f) and I (18m) have been together for a year now. Yesterday was actually our anniversary and we went out to a nice dinner to celebrate. Ellie got me this personalized photo/scrap book thing that had a bunch of notes about stuff she loved about me and other really cute handwritten messages. I loved it, especially because I'm moving off to college soon and I won't get to see her every day anymore.\n\nFor a while, I was struggling with what to get her and figured that girls seem to like jewelry. I honestly just grabbed the first necklace I could find that seemed like it was a nice quality. It was a silver necklace with a heart charm and rhinestones. I won't say how much I spent on it but it was a pretty decent chunk of change.\n\nWhen I gave it to Ellie, I immediately noticed that she wasn't excited. She kind of smiled halfheartedly and before I could put it on her, she had already put the box in her bag. It was bothering me that she didn't seem to appreciate my gift as much as I appreciated hers and I asked her about it earlier today. She wouldn't answer at first but after some wheedling, she just said \"It's silver\" and looked at me like I should understand the problem.\n\nAfter I obviously did not realize what the issue was, Ellie (kind of angrily) explained that she wears gold jewelry. I guess thinking back on it I've never seen her wear silver but I really couldn't understand the issue. I told her that she was being dramatic and kind of ungrateful. Ellie said that she \"expected a thoughtful gift, just this once\" and then left.\n\nI really am at a loss. I don't think I did anything wrong but she's normally not an unreasonable person. AITA?\n\nEdit: Alright folks I get the picture. I should have put in more effort. Just bought flowers (she loves daisies) and I'm heading to her place to beg forgiveness. I'll return the necklace and get something else but I'm probably going to stay away from jewelry cause I clearly don't have an eye for it.", "created_utc": 1689876004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154y8qn/aita_for_getting_my_girlfriend_silver_jewerly/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She spent hours putting together a scrap book of things specifically about you and what she loved about you.\n\nYou bought the first necklace you could find that seemed expensive enough because \"girls seem to like jewelry\"\n\nApparently the only things you know about your girlfriend after an entire year of dating are that she's a girl and she really loves you for some reason. What's her favorite color? What shapes or symbols does she gravitate towards? Her gift to you should have shown you that the price of the gift doesn't matter as much as the thought put into it.\n\nDo you even understand why the gift she gave you felt so nice?  It's because it was about YOU. She proved that she's been paying attention to you and knows what you like and that this relationship is important to her. You gave her a necklace because \"girls seem to like jewelry\" and called her ungrateful for not being ecstatic about a gift you could have given to your mom.", "YTA obviously. I think this post is fake too, but just in case for other guys reading. \n\nYou appreciated her gift because it was thoughtful, personal, and took effort.\n\nShe didn\u2019t appreciate your gift because it was none of those things. Of your own admission you \u201cgrabbed the first thing you saw.\u201d While it\u2019s good that you made sure it was quality, you did not make sure your girlfriend would LIKE it. She never wears silver jewelry. The necklace you are describing is the classic \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to get\u201d necklace. It is the necklace of a guy who either doesn\u2019t know his partner that well, or doesn\u2019t care.\n\nShe is realizing you don\u2019t pay attention to her and that hurts", "I mean Ellie is right you didn\u2019t put any thought into it you admitted you grabbed the first thing and left. She\u2019s upset you seem to pay no attention to what she likes and don\u2019t put the effort in. Gold and silver compliments different skin colours so she likely sticks to gold as it\u2019s what looks best on her. \n\nYTA she\u2019s upset that you\u2019ve not put the effort in not because of the price she wants to feel valued by you", "YTA. You got her what sounds like a tacky necklace (sorry but no one really likes heart shaped necklaces covered in rhinestones) in a metal colour she doesn't wear/like, because you thought to yourself, \u201cgirls seem to like jewelry.\" In this case that's not what you should've been thinking. You should've been thinking, \u201cWhat does Ellie like?\" She didn't appreciate your gift because you put zero thought into it. She put time, effort and care into a gift for you and you couldn't even bother realizing she doesn't even wear silver.", "YTA for two reasons. The first reason is that you, by your own admission, put very little thought into her gift. The gift made that obvious. That's an insult to your girlfriend.\n\nThe second reason YTA is because you've made it very clear that you haven't made the effort to be observant about her likes and dislikes. That's a big red flag in any relationship.", "YTA\n\nYou failed to treat her like an individual and put pretty much zero thought into this gift.", "Absolutely YTA, and let me explain why. \n\nLots of people in the comments are talking about how women don't like mixing metals, how you should've noticed she doesn't wear silver jewelry, etc. Those things are true, but are not the actual issue here. \n\nOP, your gf handmade you a gift that she spent *hours*, if not days, working on. It was full of very personal and meaningful notes, messages, and photos. It took genuine time, effort, and love to create and displayed a high level of her understanding of you. Her gift reflects that time, effort, love, understanding, and thoughtfulness. \n\nYour sole thought that went into this gift was, \"All girls like jewelry\". You literally grabbed the first thing that you saw that was of a mildly acceptable quality and a high enough price to seem impressive. The necklace was not even of a style or metal that she wears, which yes, *is* something you should have noticed and been aware of. But it was somewhat expensive and of a nice quality, and you couldn't think of *anything else* to get her, so you made do. \n\nHer gift shows, without question, that she understands you, and put significant thought and effort into making you something wonderful and irreplaceable that represents her love for and consideration of you. \n\nYour gift shows that you understand that \"all girls like jewelry\" and are willing to just throw expensive things at her instead of putting actual thought and effort into finding or making a gift she would actually like or appreciate. It also shows that you do not pay enough attention to her to know that she doesn't like silver jewelry, and *also* don't pay enough attention to her to remenber the things that she actually likes and enjoys, because if you did you would've been able to come up with something more personal and thoughtful than just \"*girls like jewelry*\".", "YTA because she is right. You just said yourself that you \u201cgrabbed the first necklace you could find\u201d. It was a thoughtless gift and she noticed. She could have been more appreciative but you could\u2019ve also done something worth appreciating.", "YTA\n\nIt's because you didn't think about what she would want, you admitted so in how you chose the necklace. A lot of jewelry wearers religiously wear either gold or silver, it might not seem like a big thing but not noticing will feel to her like you don't pay attention to her or what her tastes are. \n\nIt's like you supporting a football club and her buying you the jersey for the opposing team. She notices you like football but doesn't pay enough attention to know who you support.", "YTA.\n\nYou've been with her a year, and all you know is that \"girls seem to like jewelry\"???\n\nNothing about her.  Nothing about what she likes or wears.  Nothing \\*specific\\* to her, her tastes, her desires.\n\nHer gift to you was INCREDIBLY personal, and you...*haven't noticed a single distinguishing thing about your girlfriend and what she likes IN A YEAR.*", "YTA\n\nYou admit in the post that you didn\u2019t think it much and grabbed the first one you could find\n\nThe fact that she was able to tell right away speaks volumes. She was right, it was not a thoughtful gift.\n\nYou can learn from this though, try to pay attention with that she likes in the future. Being observant of your partner\u2019s preferences and tastes can go a long way", "\"...just this once\" sounds like you don't put much effort into her gifts! I noticed that when you said \"I just grabbed the first necklace I could find.\" YTA", "YTA - It\u2019s like buying you an Xbox game, when all you have is a PS. It shows you didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to the most base detail and it renders the item unusable. By your own admission, you spent very little time thinking about it. You \u2018just grabbed the first one\u2019 you could find. Sounds like she spent hours on yours. I would be so sad if I were her.", "soft YTA, you admit it wasnt a very thoughtful gift", "YTA. You put absolutely no thought into your gift and just grabbed the first thing you saw because \"girls seem to like jewelry\". Have you ever bothered to pay attention to what style jewelry she wears? Have you bothered taking note of what she actually likes in general? Why should she be eternally grateful for something you half-assed?\n\n>Ellie said that she \"expected a thoughtful gift, just this once\" and then left.\n\nSo this obviously isn't the first time you've done this", "OP - Your gf isn't being unreasonable; she's hurt that you never noticed something as small as the fact that she only wears gold jewelry. In her hurt she reacted slightly in anger because the gift she had made for you was so personal and deeply from the heart, so when you grabbed the first thing you saw, it showed her that you hadn't even taken the time to get to know the things that make her happy. I'm sure this was not your intention and I'm sorry this happened, but you seriously need to apologize to her and take the silver necklace back and actually take the time to pick out something that you KNOW she would like. She must have a favorite flower, or insect (like a butterfly), or animal (like a horse). Pick something that is special to her. Good luck", "YTA but post a pic of the necklace, let's all see what a bargain bin you got.", "\u201cGirls like jewelry so I just grabbed the first necklace I found\u201d makes YTA.", "YTA OP, you\u2019re suppose to know what the person enjoys before getting them it. For instance; my friend & I are into MLP so I decided to get him a plush because he enjoys them.", "The fact that she said she expected a thoughtful gift just this once makes me believe that this isn't an isolated incident? And honestly, you literally said that you grabbed the first necklace you could find. It doesn't sound like you did put any thought into it. Her gift to you sounds like it took a lot of time and effort. All she wants is for you to put some thought into gifts for her. You're really young, so use this as a teachable moment. YTA", "I have to go with a very soft YTA\n\nHonestly most women have a preference between silver, and gold. It's a pretty common thing. A lot of us can only wear one or the other due to our skin tones. For example, if I wear silver, it tends to make me look green in contrast, because of my skin tone. \n\nThough I get that most men are probably not aware of this issue. \n\nThe only reason I'm saying YTA at all, is because I personally think that giving gifts that show you don't really know the other person, and what they like is an AH move, and you chose a piece of jewellery for someone, without taking the time to take note of what she actually wears or likes.", "YTA\n\n>. I honestly just grabbed the first necklace I could find that seemed like it was a nice quality\n\nAnd this is the main reson.\nYou did not put emotion or thoughts in to it. After a year you did not even noticed she never wears silver. It had to be pointed out.\n\nOk as a side note, you are just 18 so there is still much to learn and time to do so.\nApologize to her.", "Soft YTA \n\n1) You admit you didn\u2019t put thought into the gift. So her having an unimpressed/ungrateful attitude isn\u2019t completely unwarranted \n\n2) You\u2019ve been dating for a year but didn\u2019t notice what type of jewelry your GF likes? Noticing gold vs silver, is the necklace in a style she would wear (a flashy pendant vs something dainty) \n\n3) ofc she wouldn\u2019t appreciate a gift that isn\u2019t in her taste, and was generally thoughtless as much as you appreciate her thoughtful hand crafted gift \n\n4) As a GENERAL RULE: do not buy partners (pricey) jewelry unless you are 100% sure they will like it. This is EXACTLY why partners should confer with each other when buying engagement rings (etc) so one isn\u2019t super hyped and excited about this great ring, and then the other sees the ring that is not even in their taste and disappoints the other bc of their reaction", "YTA. I put no thought or effort into my girlfriends gift. Why is she sad that I made it clear that I pay no attention to her likes or preferences? I spent monies tho. Who cares if it\u2019s something she would like as long as I parted with cash, right?! I\u2019ve only know her a year. Oh and btw she put hella effort in and made something that showed she loved and appreciated me which I really appreciated. Like she knew what I\u2019d like or something, weird. Oh \nJesus. We\u2019re doomed. How as a species are we still reproducing. This is what it comes to. I gave her something shiny, why isn\u2019t she bowing down. Dude seriously doubling down on being proud that he either cares do little or knows her so little that the important thing is he parted with paper. \nYou are buying her something that you presumably want her to wear often. Just try and ensure that she will want to wear it often. Or she wears an obligation", "Soft YTA, and the reason it\u2019s soft is because you\u2019re young and inexperienced. Let this be a lesson to be more thoughtful next time. If you feel stuck, ask one of her friends or family members for suggestions. \n\nTBH a silver necklace with a heart charm and rhinestones sounds like one of those tacky pre-packaged things someone would pick up at CVS when they forgot to get a real gift.", "YTA - It may sound silly, but \"gold girls\" stay gold girls and \"silver girls\" stay silver girls. I'm sure it was hurtful that you hadn't noticed every single one of her pieces were gold. I myself am a gold girl, and I would 100% be upset if my boyfriend got me a silver necklace.", "YTA. You don't give a shit about her preferences, made it abundantly clear you didn't put any thought into her gift, or her. It's basically like if you played first person shooter and she got you stardew valley as a gift.", "YTA not for giving her silver jewelry, but for not putting any thought and effort into her gift, nor her likes. From her gift, I bet she would have appreciated a cheaper, thoughtful gift.", "YTA\n\nShe put a lot of thought into her gift.  It showed.  You picked out the first thing that looked decent because girls like jewelry.  Her being mad at you isn't about what it's made of.  It's about your complete and utter lack of effort in finding a good anniversary gift for her.  Something that tells her that you thought of her, and about her, and that you care about her.  You did the least amount of work and now you're shocked by it.  You should take this as a lesson and work to do better for your next girlfriends.", "Soft YTA. Her comment that she expected you to be thoughtful for once showed that you really don\u2019t seem to put a lot of consideration into her gifts. It\u2019s not about money here. She spent time making you a thoughtful, personalized scrapbook she thought you would love (and you did) and you threw money at the first piece of jewelry you saw without noticing if it was her style. You expected her to fake it with your gift to spare your ego?", "YTA. A gift does not have to be expensive to be thoughtful. \n\nAs they say, \"It's the thought that counts\" and you put no thought into this gift at all.", "YTA\n\nI have a FRIEND that only wear silver and I noticed.\n\nYou said yourself you just grabbed the first thing you found, the very minimum would be to worry about if it\u2019s something she would wear or not. Of course she\u2019s not being ridiculous, she spent a lot of time and thought into your present and you gave her something you don\u2019t even see her using", "YTA. your girlfriend is upset because you don't put as much effort into this relationship as she does. seriously, you've been with her for a year and you couldn't think before buying her something? learn before you lose her. though you might already have. then learn so you don't mess things up with a future partner either.", "Soft YTA. You honestly didn\u2019t know silver OR gold is a thing. I\u2019m a silver girl, and I\u2019m turned off by gold jewelry. Your gf is the opposite. \n\nShe\u2019s upset because you didn\u2019t take the time to get to know her preferences. She gave you a gift that shows she understands you and felt you didn\u2019t do the same. \n\nTake this as a learning experience and a chance to do better moving forward.", "YTA, not a big asshole but you should have asked her before hand. Mixing metals is not what most people go for. If she wears another gold necklace, or gold rings, gold bracelet then she wants any new piece to match. I doubt she\u2019s asked for \u201cgold\u201d as in the mineral. Just the color.", "YTA but only slightly. Good intentions but you could have talked to her girlfriends for advice in advance.", "Yeahhh so girls that care about metals care about metals. I also only wear gold and rose gold, if you have a warm undertone or gold hair/highlights, silver doesn't look right. I wouldn't expect dudes to know this but also I hate be when dudes buy me jewelry, clothing, or perfume, I'm picky AF about those things. Even my girlfriends won't get it right.", "If your reason was \u2018oh I noticed you always wear gold and wanted to give you something different\u2019 it would be a different thing. But you literally plunked down a \u2018decent chunk of change\u2019 for the first thing you saw. You put money into it but no time, while she did a personalized gift that she put done feeling into.\nI won\u2019t necessarily say you\u2019re wrong here- a lot of people aren\u2019t good gift givers, or don\u2019t use gifts as one of their love languages.\nThe question is, now that you know it\u2019s *her* love language, how are you going to work this out with her?", "YTA.  Okay, so she got you a very thoughtful gift, full of care and affection for you, and you got her something she wouldn\u2019t even wear?  I understand being bad at gift giving, but that\u2019s a bit obvious that you haven\u2019t been paying her enough attention.  \u201cGirls seem to like jewelry,\u201d we aren\u2019t talking about girls, we\u2019re talking about YOUR girlfriend. \n\nOkay, I\u2019ve ripped into you enough.  Here\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do. 1: You\u2019re gonna apologize, say you\u2019re not a gift giver type. 2: You\u2019re gonna return that necklace, and you\u2019re gonna ask her where she wants to go shopping, and use that money and a little more to make her feel special.  Or, alternatively, just ask her what kind of gift she expected.  Open that line of communication so that you can understand her better.  If you want to come back from this, you have to build it up better.   Have an honest chat and own up to it.", "sweet child, never buy those overpriced silver heart necklaces. not a single woman in this world actually likes them. it was sweet, but not much effort.", "Posts like this make me so glad that me and my husband never buy gifts for each other. Life is so much easier when you don't have the pressure of gifting multiple times a year for your partner. \n\nI'm going to say a gentle ESH because you didn't really put any thought into your gift for Ellie and Ellie is ungrateful. But then again, is she? If she sussed that you didn't put any thought in to the gift you bought for her, should she just suck it up and pretend to be happy? I don't know what the etiquette is for a situation like this.", "NAH\n\n> she wears gold jewelry.\n\n>  I really couldn't understand the issue.\n\nYou don't mix metals.", "NTA.  It sounds like you guys are mismatched.  Sorry you dropped a decent chunk of change on jewelry that she didn't even like.  I will be amazed if this relationship outlasts your first year of college.", "NTA in my opinion but I will say this - no woman I have ever met actually like heart pendants. I'd also take the time to make it up to her as you could definitely have put more thought into the gift, but I don't think that makes you an asshole.", "ESH. By your own admission, you didn't put much thought into the gift. But she reacted like a spoiled brat.", "Here I am, at 42, realizing that sth must be very wrong with me, for wearing silver, and gold, and rose gold and steel and black and whatever jewelry I happen to like that day or goes with my clothes or whatever.", "NAH but I understand she was expecting you to put some thought into it. Maybe before you move away do a collage of your favourite photos together in a nice frame or even one favourite photo. Something you\u2019ve actually put thought into.", "ESH. She was right that you didn't put any thought into the gift, but at the same time, being upset because you were given silver instead of gold is such an absurd first world problem for a teenager to have that I cannot in good conscience absolve her of being an AH.", "bruh no one is the asshole. You got the wrong color. there's obviously deeper troubles in this relationship and from her little remark at the end it seems like she feels as though you dont take the time to pay attention to things that she likes. return the silver, purchase gold, and ask her about how she is feeling. log off bro", "NTA. Imagine getting reamed out by the girlfriend and the internet for not being able to afford a necklace of a material that is 78 times more expensive than the necklace he got.", "NTA.

She isn't complaining about how much money he spent, just how much thought he put into the gift.", "1) pay attention to the metal color. There are gold girls and silver girls. Most women don\u2019t wear both. If she is always wearing gold, she will never wear silver.\n\n2) pick out something that is either sentimental or her style.

She just wanted something you put effort into. She gave you a VERY thoughtful gift that no doubt took her a lot of time and effort. You gave her a gift that showed her you didn\u2019t even put any thought into what she likes or is into.  She seems like the kind of person that would wear a $25 necklace every day if she knew it really came from your heart. In general, shop with your heart and not your wallet next time. A gift isn\u2019t good just because it was pricey, and it\u2019s not a bad gift just because it wasn\u2019t. Moreover, you need to learn her love language and show her love in that way, for her to receive it properly.

If you cannot easily discern what will be something she would love then you need to take the time to find something else that\u2019s not jewelry that she will love. \n\nJust thinking girl = loves jewelry is kind of misogynistic and meaningless.\n\nIt didn\u2019t even have to be expensive. It just had to be something you know she would like. And you failed in that.", "The quality and price are irrelevant. You should have gotten something that was similar in style, color, etc., to what she already wears. Have you noticed at all how often she even wears jewelry? I NEVER wear jewelry and if I had been dating a guy for a year and he didn't notice that and got me a necklace, I'd be a bit annoyed regardless of the color, price, or quality. Just because \"girls seem to like jewelry\" does not mean it is a good gift for all girls", "Why does it have to be jewellery?\n\n Girls like other things too. What\u2019s her favourite band? Maybe get tickets. What sort of trips does she like going on? Organise one of those. Take her for a picnic and bring all her favourite foods. Make a memory book of all your favourite photos together with mementos from those times. Treat her to a spa day with you or if money is tight learn how do those things yourself & pamper her (lots of info like that on YouTube you don\u2019t need to be professional)\n\nJewellery is often a quick go to gift when men need to buy something but aren\u2019t really sure what they\u2019re buying. Using literally you\u2019re argument of girls like jewellery.", "I believe The Office has an entire episode about this concept lol", "Exactly. \u201cThe thought counts\u201d isn\u2019t applicable when there\u2019s zero thought process in the first place.", "Yeah gold and silver can look different depending on your skin colour so people will stick with the one that compliments their skin the most", "Most people just tend to have strong preferences for particular colours of jewelry and end up gravitating towards those colours naturally. I've heard about it being a skin tone thing too, like how pale people \"shouldn't\" wear peachy colours because it in theory doesn't suit them. Blondes look better in silver apparently, It's not a real rule, but it's something people do seem to follow and/or tend to agree with. \n\nThat being said, some people love mixing metals (my mom), and some people (myself) hate mixing metals, just one of those things yk. At the end of the day wear what you like, and if you have a collection of both, c'est la vie and enjoy your jewelry!", "yes. I'm a goth and I only wear silver or black jewelry, never gold. it wouldn't fit my aesthetic.", "I think it\u2019s more that if he did gift his GF jewelry that it was something done with little care. When you\u2019re with someone you should know them well enough to understand their preferences.", "He could have gotten something gold plated. It\u2019s still gold color also affordable.", "Yes, that's a general observation having to do with the comments about women being exclusive to one metal. As for the poster and his girlfriend I don't know, they seem too young to a) be this hung up about jewelry b) be in the wrong for not noticing.", "Bahaha you\u2019re right! I completely forgot about that.", "I wish I got the analogy from the office, I think it was somebody on tiktok", "I'm like fifty shades of white, what metalteam should I join then?", "I think the gf is upset because it seems OP often doesn't put thought into things for her/pays attention to her likes and dislikes tbh. I'd be pretty upset if I was her too.", "It depends on your undertones if you have cool undertones (so your skin is more pink/blue) silver looks best. You can also test your undertones with your veins if you look at them and they are blue/purple you\u2019re cool undertones. If you\u2019re warm undertones so more yellow you suit gold better. Your veins will look green if you\u2019re warm undertoned", "I guess so, yes. They still seem children to me, although with the number of grandparents in their 40s we see here, I shouldn't be so surprised\ud83d\ude00"]}
