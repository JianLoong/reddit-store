I'm not big into drinking alcohol. I'll sip a glass of wine at a wedding or something but I don't enjoy alcohol. So I'm usually designated driver and I am fine with that. Long story short went to the party with three other friends. Two of them had other arrangements and didn't need a ride home but the end of the night(morning) I was going home with my tipsy friend I came with. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThroughout the night I noticed this girl that came alone and didn't really have a \"group\" and she seemed shy. I made small talk with her in passing a couple of times but that was it. End of the night she is DRUNK. Like stumbling around and nodding off. Was planning on leaving within the hour so I was keeping an eye on her(from a distance) and offered her a ride home.  She accepted but looked nervous about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was in the back seat and my friend was in the front with me. She was still drunk but there enough to guide us to where she lives. My friend was making conversation and when he found out where she lived he was like \"we're taking the long way there, we should be going this way\" and I just said I'm gonna take whatever way she was directing. It only was like 20 or so minutes of driving anyway. My friend got upset like \"we could be there so much faster.\" I dropped her off and made sure she made it inside then headed back to our area. My friend was really upset and saying like \"I dismissed him and belittled him in front of someone else.\" He was pissed and said we should have just taken his route. I thought it was silly for him to be upset. I flat out told him that to her we were two strange men taking her somewhere while she is vulnerable. I didn't want to start straying from the path and just take the route she felt most comfortable with. This really upset him and I thought he was just being this way because he was under the influence but he brought it up again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPretty much conversation while driving went like \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer: Turn here\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHim: No we shouldn't turn here\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: I'm turning here\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe accused me of being \"a cuck\" which I don't even understand how that applies to this situation. I was never really close with this guy before. More like friend of a friend I see at social gatherings. But this made me rethink hanging with him again.

If you started following his directions it could have startled or worried the girl so by following her directions you made sure she felt comfortable", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou had a young, vulnerable and intoxicated woman in the back of the car. You taking her the route she knew and felt most comfortable with would have saved her a huge amount of anxiety. \n\nIt was a very kind thing that you did, and hugely responsible that you don't drink and provide a safe ride home for your friends. The world needs more young men like you. I hope my sons grow up to be like you.\n\nYour \"friend\" is a complete prick in this situation. What's an extra few minutes to make sure she was comfortable and safe? And if he felt \"dismissed\" or \"belittled\" that's a him problem. Not a you problem. Because as a woman, who was once young and a little more wild than I care to admit, I can tell you that even being in an Uber and going a different route used to freak me the fuck out. Even if I had my location shared. \n\nAt the end of the day, not everyone in the world is decent and there's a small percentage who would have done unspeakable things and even something as small as a route she's not 100% certain of could have kicked in her fight or flight", "Nta. And the world needs more men like you.", "NTA, your friend is a know-it-all and wants to control people around him.  I'd keep my distance from here on out.  This a little too wierd.", "\u201cI flat out told him that to her we were two strange men taking her somewhere while she is vulnerable.\u201d\n\nYES!!!! Thank you OP for seeing that she was vulnerable and possibly slightly uncomfortable in a car with two strangers. And thank you for not only driving her home, but making sure she was safely inside. You are a gentleman! Nta, your friend sucks.", "NTA\n\nYour friend sounds like a hot headed drunk. Explain to him why you did what you did when you're sober, arguing with drunk people usually gets nowhere.", "No NTA you're absolutely right that's exactly what she would've thought. I was really hoping throughout that you didn't listen to your friend and stray from the way she was telling you. Your friend is being immature because he's getting his ego hurt when there's absolutely no reason for it.", "NTA - Why is a grown man talking about \u201cyou dismissed me\u201d. You took a different route. If he got offended at that, there\u2019s some other deep insecurities there.", "NTA - as a woman, you absolutely did the right thing. She could have been overly disoriented by your going a different way and not able to direct you at all, and it certainly could have been terrifying for her if you intentionally didn't listen to her directions, even with good intentions. Your \"friend\" was dismissive of her and you and he seems like an a-hole. \n\nI'm very glad you are so caring and did the right thing for this woman. I hope she was lucid enough to remember your kindness!", "NTA \n\nShe took a risk accepting your offer since she doesn't really know you. You did right by allowing her to give directions and sticking to what she told you, probably making her feel immensely better about trusting you.\n\nWho cares if the other route would've been faster? Your friend needs to let it go. If he felt belittled by you saying you were just gonna go with what she says, he needs to do some self-reflection.\n\nYou did good, OP.", "Nta, thank you for keeping her comfort in mind. I honestly question your friends intentions by calling that word.", "NTA\n\nYou are driving, you get to decide which road to take. If friend is unhappy with that, friend can walk.", "NTA, you did right! It was very kind of you to make sure she felt safe", "NTA.\nAside from the fact that you are absolutely right not to scare this girl. Honestly not sure why he thinks he knows where she lives better than she does. I\u2019d have just stopped the car and told him to walk tbh.", "NTA. Ignoring the drunk girls directions could have freaked her out.", "NTA. You did exactly the right thing by following the girls directions and not taking the route that your friend claimed would be faster. A girl being drunk and in a car with two strange men is a potentially very dangerous situation for her and it sounds like she was aware of the potential danger with the fact that she looked nervous so you following her directions and not going a different route was the best thing that you could\u2019ve done to help her feel safe in your car and show her that she wasn\u2019t wrong to agree to your offer to drive her home. Your friend sounds like an ass and if he doesn\u2019t seem to care about that girl, or others, feeling safe in his presence then you may not want to be friends with him anymore.", "NTA \n\nWtf, I hope you continue to challenge your friend on his poor awareness of women's safety (and courtesy towards anyone of any gender)", "NTA: You were a thoughtful person. You were completely right that she was already nervous so if she were to notice you went a different way she might have freaked out.\n\nYour friend was buzzed or drunk but an ass.", "NTA - You were doing them both a favor. I also am often the DD. The rule is if you do not like how I drive then you are free to find other accommodations. So your car, you were driving -   \ntotally within your right to follow her directions.", "NTA.\n\nThanks for not putting her in a situation where she had to fear for her safety. You sound like a real nice guy", "It was kind in the first instance to offer to get her home, but you absolutely did the right thing to also do whatever you could to make sure she felt safe. NTA. \n  \n  Your instincts are serving you well with this d-bag, he\u2019s not a good guy and he\u2019s not your friend. Ditch him.", "NTA\n\nRule of thumb for life: Anyone who uses the word cuck shouldn't really be your friend. Your life will be better without them.\n\nAlso, \"I was trying to belittle you in front of someone else and you didn't let me and that made ME feel belittled!\" isn't really a good argument. Instead he should have said, \"Thanks for the ride and not drinking at the party! Appreciate you, dude!\"", "NTA\n\nYou were right to just follow her directions to make her feel safe/comfortable.  I don't really understand why your buddy was so upset about taking a different route (probably had something to do with him being drunk), he's just along for the ride and shouldn't be backseat driving.", "NTA - you handled it pretty much exactly as you should have.", "NTA you made the right decision to help her feel safe. Your \u201cfriend\u201d has some nerve getting mad at his designated driver for DRIVING.\n\nI\u2019d ditch the guy with the fragile ego. This won\u2019t be the last time he decides to be an AH for no reason.", "NTA but this seems like a situation with no real solutions. On the one hand, you taking her home seems super sketchy to anyone else. On the other hand, if you dont, shes stranded and vulnerable.", "NTA. You handled this perfectly and your friend sucks.", "NTA, you deviate from her path in her drunken state could be a big deal. She flips, calls 911 these guys are trying to kidnap me etc....\n\nYou did the right thing, getting her home safe, and following her crappy directions. Your buddy needs to calm the f down.

Friend of a Friend is a weirdo, tho.", "NTA: Nobody who calls you \"a cuck\" is worth the trouble they're going to cause you.", "NTA. You were careful to let the girl feel as OK with the event as possible. Switching the route on her would set off an alarm bell. Like, Where are you headed? To a dark alley, etc.?\n\nYour friend lacks the smarts to understand yet he still decides to make a drama.", "He's mad you didn't listen to him...

I once had a taxi driver park in a dark spot up the road from my house and try to force me to date him. It\u2019s been almost 20 years and I still regularly think about the fear I felt.", "To the situation at hand: I had something similiar happen. Blackout drunk girl, party was  not in comfortable walking distance from the next houses, barely able to walk. Two female friends (early 20s, maybe even teens. drinking age of 16/18 here) of hers try to help her, barely able to do so physically, I didn\u2019t know any of them. I get the feeling this won\u2018t go well so I follow them. I catch up to them, smalltalk. They ordered a taxi for her and their plan was to just put her in it and thats it. One of the girls doesn\u2018t know her that well and the other one is also quite drunk. I tried talking them into driving with her - because she obviously won\u2018t be able to enter her house alone. Drunk girl is asleep at that point. One of the girls wanders off to the party, I can convince the other one to stay with her for the ride and just return to the party afterwards. Taxi arrives, drunk friend is entirely unable to get super drunk girl into the car so out of it will most likely not work either. I decide to drive with them. Again: all of them are basically strangers to me. I co-organized the party with two friends and there were around 150 people. Might be they knew me by sight, might be they did not.\nSuper drunk girl can\u2018t give taxi driver an adress, other girl knows the rough location like \u201etwo houses left to that one ice cream shop whose name i dont\u2019t know\u201c but has no idea how to get there. Guess how amused the taxi driver was. Super drunk girl starts to brabble directions which would lead us to another city entirely. Friend of mine lived next to the ice cream shop and I\u2018m from around there so I start to tell the taxi driver how to get there and we manage to find it. Guess who had no money or was too drunk to pay? Right, *both* of them. So I had to pay - for the trip back aswell ofc. I also had to half-carry super drunk girl down a flight of stairs she would otherwise probably have fallen down which drunk friend definitly was not capable of physically.\nCould super drunk girl maybe have slept at drunk friends place to spare us the entire \u201ewhere does she even live\u201c-ordeal? I have no fkn clue and was too drunk to think of that myself. Took the taxi back, party was nearing it\u2018s end, I slept next to the tents that were already occupied by then.\n\nListening to the sentiment on reddit generally and this thread especially there were so many points I should have just minded my own business as to not \u201emake them uncomfortable\u201c or make them deem me a creep or even predator. When I followed them. When I started discussing their plans how to bring their friend home. Especially when I decided to drive with them. When I was belittling her when I interfered with her plainly wrong wrong directions apparently aswell. Maybe they weren\u2018t even uncomfortable. I definitely was. A fkn lot. \nBest case of me not \u201emaking them uncomfortable\u201c would have probably resulted in the girl getting kicked out of the taxi driver by herself in the middle of nowhere after being unable to articulate a destination. And then\u2026 sleeping until sober in the street I guess? or getting to deal with the cops after not being able to pay up if they managed to find her house.  Best cases. Worst cases need not much imagination I guess.\n\nI did not ever hear anything from super drunk girl btw. Drunk friend came while we were cleaning the next day, gave me a torn bill I had to bring to a bank to even get it\u2019s worth that was about 1/4 of what the taxi cost, said not much more than a simple  thanks and left us to tidy up.\nWould I do it again? Most likely yes. But every reddit thread like this collectively shitting on \u201emaking someone uncomfortable\u201c makes it every so slightly more likely that I just mind my own business when two strangers seem incapable of caring for a third one.", "The feelings his friend actually felt and articulated are \u201ehim problems\u201c and should be ignored. The feelings OP (and the entirety of this thread) just assumes by literally no indication whatsover (that OP stated) *could* be there for the women have to be accomated. Not even by asking her, but just by assuming. That sounds awfully regressive to me. Please don\u2018t teach your sons that their feelings are to be dismissed and always come second to the potential feelings of others - they will be two Andrew Tate videos away of becoming Incels.\n\nAlso - friend is an absolute prick for getting drunk and talking shit that hurt nobody but himself. But getting drunk to the point of stumbling around and nodding of while at a party where you apparently know nobody, not organizing a ride or taxi beforehand and then having to rely on the service of complete strangers to get to your home that is a 20minute *car drive* away \u2026 is not even worth a mention? \n\nNAH , maybe the girl for putting herself in such a shit situation.", "YNTA\n\nFriend of friend  sounds like a drunken asshole though. \ud83d\ude44", "You're part of the reason women aren't safe.", "Red pill kool-aid ?", "I love this sexist sub lol.

A taxi is infinitely safer as an option for anyone than diving into a car with people you don't know. There's record of what taxi driver picked you up, most of their cars are traceable etc. a stranger you don't knows car? There's no guarantee you would even remember the make and model. \n\n3) you had 3 intoxicated girls with you, not 2 men (one being totally sober) to one woman and a totally impartial witness. The witness being the taxi driver. OP just had the girl in the back and the dreadful friend. No impartial witnesses. Only two friends and one girl who didn't really know them.\n\n4) the directions girl you speak of was so black out that she didn't know her address. The likelihood of the directions you take scaring her are slim because she was past the point of having the capacity or function to be scared. The girl in OP's story gave a route she knew. One she felt safest with. She did that because whilst drunk, she was aware enough to know her surroundings and likely chose the route with most light or busiest roads or most houses. Places she could scramble to for help. \n\n5) the girl in OP's story was a girl on her own. In yours there was 3 girls who even if they don't know eachother well, knew eachother enough to feel some form of comfort from being with the others. We are taught, from a shockingly young age, to go to bathrooms together, to leave when our friends do, to make sure nobody goes home alone, to stick together because it's safer. That's drilled into us from the moment we start going out, and I don't necessarily mean out drinking. I mean just going out with our friends. \"Stay together, stay safe, be home for 8\". \n\nYou had 2 women + a taxi driver + the intoxicated one. The chance of you being able to do something horrific is far less than the chance OP and/or his friend COULD have. It's far, far higher for OP. Thank everything he's a genuinely great man and did all he did.\n\nSo yes it was great you intervened and great for anyone to intervene with highly intoxicated people at parties but you also have to understand that there's a reason so many of us have experiences that are us telling OP what he did was right, that he didn't freak her out, that he did make her feel safe. It's because the percentage of women who have been harassed, assaulted, accosted, and worse whilst they are intoxicated is far too high.", "They did watch her go inside, but that's something they could only know at the end.

Maybe there's something in that when it comes to sensibility and kindness haha.", "https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27244/did-bmw-recall-their-gps-system-due-to-its-female-voice\n\nhttp://www.hoaxorfact.com/technology/bmw-recalled-its-gps-system-as-german-men-refused-to-take-directions-from-female-voice.html\n\nPlease use your eyes balls not ballsack to understand the world you live in.", "Funnily enough our dnd sessions are played in a wow setting. Our discord server is a mix of WoW and LoL, me being one of the league gamers. So all the other players in the dnd canpaign have played wow, so my character is a ranger who got lost in the woods for years.

I don't know your friend but I'm assuming they are not part of a population that has to worry about getting harassed or attacked. They just don't realize.", "NTA. You seem like a really great guy.", "She's shy, single, in car with strangers. Kind strangers, but strangers. You listening to her was kind, empathetic, and helped keep stress levels low. Your passenger- seat driver friend needs to STFU because he's TA and a bit oblivious.", "NTA.  Taking a different way other than what she was saying would have led to her most likely freaking out.", "Your friend is an asshole.\n\nYou were being a descent human being toward to the young woman, keeping her safety and feelings in mind.\n\nYou should dump your \"friend\".\n\nYou're NTA OP.", "NTA. Hero would be a more apt description. You did the honorable thing in so many ways. You kept an eye on a vulnerable girl, offered her a lift and didn\u2019t freak her out by going a way contrary to her directions. You would be wise to rethink your friendship with that loser and keep on being your great self.", "NTA.  Your friend is a bad dude that wanted to take advantage of the girl.", "NTA. Super appreciate your level of awareness and standing up to your friend.", "Your buddy needs to lay off the red pill content haha.", "NTA. Just wanted to say thank you for taking her home safely.", "NTA, someone raised you decently.", "\"He accused me of being a cuck\"\n\nI'm sorry but that's so funny. Only beta males make sure women get home safely, OP. Do better next time/s.\n\nNTA.", "[removed]", "NTA, the way you handled the situation was perfect! You sound like a stand up and respectful guy and your friend sounds like a toxic alpha bro!", "NTA. You\u2019re a wonderful person for driving her home and so much more mature than your nasty friend. If he doesn\u2019t understand that shows such a low level of empathy.", "You did the right thing, and considering his reaction, I wouldn\u2019t trust him if he was in the same situation as you.", "Ok definetely NTA\n\nThanks for driving her home and not letting her wander off on her own.\n\nWhy is your friend calling you a cuck? In that situation its extremely worrying imo. As if you destroyed a \"chance\" for him with the girl that was drunk out of her mind.\n\nInsane tbh i would break off contact with that person...", "My comment is going to get lost bc I\u2019m late to the party but I have a relevant anecdote that doesn\u2019t seem right to tack onto a top comment. \n\nWhen I was 19 I was casually sleeping with a guy I met on Tinder. We\u2019d hung out a few times already so at this point I was comfortable getting in his car (wouldn\u2019t do it now but again: 19) + his house was only ten minutes from my dorm. The FIRST time he drove me home, he ignored my directions and took his own route back to my school\u2026 totally normal in his mind, it was his alumni so duh why not take the route he knows, right? Nope. I was stoned, having a panic attack in the passenger seat, hyperventilating, and literally almost peed myself I was so convinced I was about to die. And this was with someone *I had already fucked.* When he pulled into my dorm I said \u201cDon\u2019t do that shit.\u201d and literally never spoke to him again. He had zero bad intentions but it made me feel horrible enough in that moment that I no longer felt safe talking to him. \n\n*You made the right decision.* And your friend is a creep. NTA.", "NTA, more like a literal hero? I\u2019m so glad, I was expecting something horrible. \n\nIf you ever do this again, I\u2019d have a record of my actions ie ask her consent for a video my name is x and I\u2019ll drive her home and record the whole journey. \n\nAlso frequently men like your friend is why women feel unsafe, he is the true ass here", "Your car, your decision. I don't get why your friend was getting upset about that in the first place.\nYou did the right thing and I'd would panic as well, when someone I give directions to would go a different route.", "NTA this is sus as hell.  Do not hang out with him again.  You 100% did the right thing.", "Your friend ITA.", "Did he have to poo really bad?", "NTA. You did the right thing. If he thinks there's a faster route, he's always welcome to get out and walk it...", "NTA you absolutely did the right thing. If I was that girl and you started taking a different route to what I told you I would panic and probably try to get out of the car which undoubtedly while drunk would have ended badly.\n\nThe fact that you took her feelings into account is amazing and not a standard most men would uphold (like your friend).", "I'm pretty sure he's poisoned his mind with all the \"alpha male\" crap. Those type of people always piss their pants and cry if they don't get to be the main character.", "People love using those kinda terms abusively now it\u2019s obnoxious AF", "I have never used the term \"cuck\" before, mostly because I have no reason to use it as it just doesn't roll off the tongue well and sounds terrible with any sentence lol, so I just use actually well known cuss words to describe my anger (usually not directed at anyone)", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

OP is a bro and knew what to do. He should explain it to his friend this way. Drunk girl panics and gets out and is never seen again. It could happen, and why would you want that kind of heat? Or that kind of guilt?", "Yes! OMG, my (46f) dad and stepdad BOTH drilled this into me. If someone is giving you a ride and veers off the known/discussed route, do anything you have to do to get out of that car ASAP. Bite, kick, break windows, crash the car if you have to, but don't let them take you away from what you're familiar with.", "Why else would he call OP a cuck exactly?", "Some people are just like that.", "If I were driving someone as a favor and they called me a cuck they would be walking home from the closest place I could safely pull over.", "For similarly disgusting reasons. I recently watched a YT video (I think YouTube??? now I\u2019m not sure, maybe it was clips on Tiktok) about how abusive men are to female-voiced AI.", "Exactly. I was told how to get away from a mugging as a very young child - not a lot of detail, basically SING, run and scream - but the lesson works for any motivation for assault and I'm sure my mother was thinking about that. \n\nSimilarly I knew the fundamentals of sex and safe sex before I was 10, but that was maybe inevitable because a close family member worked for Durex \ud83d\ude06 (cute little kid sticks their head in the doorway, \"what's a condom?\")", "I never would have gotten that. Thank you!", "Hey asshole, I never disputed the gps claim.\n\nThat first link is no better than yahoo answers or Quora. Lol you're not credible.\n\nAnd holy shit the sexism is so strong. Yelling at me about male anatomy. Get a grip you loser.\n\nThe sources for this claim are AWFUL. Is there a single news article about it? Not blogs or Facebook or Twitter posts? Googles top posts are all nothing but unsourced blogs.\n\nThe \"source\" for this claim all points back to Nass saying so in an interview with NPR. This is VERY hard to believe.", "Get a grip yourself. I purposely pick something easy enough for you to understand. And from your comment there wouldn\u2019t be anything simple enough for you to grasp anything. \n\nLiterally all the back up studies are linked if you bother looking. Dates of the event aren\u2019t current so asking for a new or recent article, is at best silly -to not follow your injurious path. And if you weren\u2019t stuck so far in your own ass, you may be able to understand than if something happens at a certain time or place it doesn\u2019t means it will always be the same again, nor any time, nor everywhere, nor that it\u2019s remotely right. \n\nIf anything contradictory with your unfounded beliefs throw you off the handle, you are not ready to be out in public. You have a really long path before reaching maturity.
