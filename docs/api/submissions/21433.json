I'm not big into drinking alcohol. I'll sip a glass of wine at a wedding or something but I don't enjoy alcohol. So I'm usually designated driver and I am fine with that. Long story short went to the party with three other friends. Two of them had other arrangements and didn't need a ride home but the end of the night(morning) I was going home with my tipsy friend I came with. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThroughout the night I noticed this girl that came alone and didn't really have a \"group\" and she seemed shy. I made small talk with her in passing a couple of times but that was it. End of the night she is DRUNK. Like stumbling around and nodding off. Was planning on leaving within the hour so I was keeping an eye on her(from a distance) and offered her a ride home.  She accepted but looked nervous about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was in the back seat and my friend was in the front with me. She was still drunk but there enough to guide us to where she lives. My friend was making conversation and when he found out where she lived he was like \"we're taking the long way there, we should be going this way\" and I just said I'm gonna take whatever way she was directing. It only was like 20 or so minutes of driving anyway. My friend got upset like \"we could be there so much faster.\" I dropped her off and made sure she made it inside then headed back to our area. My friend was really upset and saying like \"I dismissed him and belittled him in front of someone else.\" He was pissed and said we should have just taken his route. I thought it was silly for him to be upset. I flat out told him that to her we were two strange men taking her somewhere while she is vulnerable. I didn't want to start straying from the path and just take the route she felt most comfortable with. This really upset him and I thought he was just being this way because he was under the influence but he brought it up again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPretty much conversation while driving went like \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer: Turn here\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHim: No we shouldn't turn here\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: I'm turning here\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe accused me of being \"a cuck\" which I don't even understand how that applies to this situation. I was never really close with this guy before. More like friend of a friend I see at social gatherings. But this made me rethink hanging with him again.

If you started following his directions it could have startled or worried the girl so by following her directions you made sure she felt comfortable", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou had a young, vulnerable and intoxicated woman in the back of the car. You taking her the route she knew and felt most comfortable with would have saved her a huge amount of anxiety. \n\nIt was a very kind thing that you did, and hugely responsible that you don't drink and provide a safe ride home for your friends. The world needs more young men like you. I hope my sons grow up to be like you.\n\nYour \"friend\" is a complete prick in this situation. What's an extra few minutes to make sure she was comfortable and safe? And if he felt \"dismissed\" or \"belittled\" that's a him problem. Not a you problem. Because as a woman, who was once young and a little more wild than I care to admit, I can tell you that even being in an Uber and going a different route used to freak me the fuck out. Even if I had my location shared. \n\nAt the end of the day, not everyone in the world is decent and there's a small percentage who would have done unspeakable things and even something as small as a route she's not 100% certain of could have kicked in her fight or flight", "Nta. And the world needs more men like you.", "NTA, your friend is a know-it-all and wants to control people around him.  I'd keep my distance from here on out.  This a little too wierd.", "\u201cI flat out told him that to her we were two strange men taking her somewhere while she is vulnerable.\u201d\n\nYES!!!! Thank you OP for seeing that she was vulnerable and possibly slightly uncomfortable in a car with two strangers. And thank you for not only driving her home, but making sure she was safely inside. You are a gentleman! Nta, your friend sucks.", "NTA\n\nYour friend sounds like a hot headed drunk. Explain to him why you did what you did when you're sober, arguing with drunk people usually gets nowhere.", "No NTA you're absolutely right that's exactly what she would've thought. I was really hoping throughout that you didn't listen to your friend and stray from the way she was telling you. Your friend is being immature because he's getting his ego hurt when there's absolutely no reason for it.", "NTA - Why is a grown man talking about \u201cyou dismissed me\u201d. You took a different route. If he got offended at that, there\u2019s some other deep insecurities there.", "NTA - as a woman, you absolutely did the right thing. She could have been overly disoriented by your going a different way and not able to direct you at all, and it certainly could have been terrifying for her if you intentionally didn't listen to her directions, even with good intentions. Your \"friend\" was dismissive of her and you and he seems like an a-hole. \n\nI'm very glad you are so caring and did the right thing for this woman. I hope she was lucid enough to remember your kindness!", "NTA \n\nShe took a risk accepting your offer since she doesn't really know you. You did right by allowing her to give directions and sticking to what she told you, probably making her feel immensely better about trusting you.\n\nWho cares if the other route would've been faster? Your friend needs to let it go. If he felt belittled by you saying you were just gonna go with what she says, he needs to do some self-reflection.\n\nYou did good, OP.", "Nta, thank you for keeping her comfort in mind. I honestly question your friends intentions by calling that word.", "NTA\n\nYou are driving, you get to decide which road to take. If friend is unhappy with that, friend can walk.", "NTA, you did right! It was very kind of you to make sure she felt safe", "NTA.\nAside from the fact that you are absolutely right not to scare this girl. Honestly not sure why he thinks he knows where she lives better than she does. I\u2019d have just stopped the car and told him to walk tbh.", "NTA. Ignoring the drunk girls directions could have freaked her out.", "NTA. You did exactly the right thing by following the girls directions and not taking the route that your friend claimed would be faster. A girl being drunk and in a car with two strange men is a potentially very dangerous situation for her and it sounds like she was aware of the potential danger with the fact that she looked nervous so you following her directions and not going a different route was the best thing that you could\u2019ve done to help her feel safe in your car and show her that she wasn\u2019t wrong to agree to your offer to drive her home. Your friend sounds like an ass and if he doesn\u2019t seem to care about that girl, or others, feeling safe in his presence then you may not want to be friends with him anymore.", "NTA \n\nWtf, I hope you continue to challenge your friend on his poor awareness of women's safety (and courtesy towards anyone of any gender)", "NTA: You were a thoughtful person. You were completely right that she was already nervous so if she were to notice you went a different way she might have freaked out.\n\nYour friend was buzzed or drunk but an ass.", "NTA - You were doing them both a favor. I also am often the DD. The rule is if you do not like how I drive then you are free to find other accommodations. So your car, you were driving -   \ntotally within your right to follow her directions.", "NTA.\n\nThanks for not putting her in a situation where she had to fear for her safety. You sound like a real nice guy", "It was kind in the first instance to offer to get her home, but you absolutely did the right thing to also do whatever you could to make sure she felt safe. NTA. \n  \n  Your instincts are serving you well with this d-bag, he\u2019s not a good guy and he\u2019s not your friend. Ditch him.", "NTA\n\nRule of thumb for life: Anyone who uses the word cuck shouldn't really be your friend. Your life will be better without them.\n\nAlso, \"I was trying to belittle you in front of someone else and you didn't let me and that made ME feel belittled!\" isn't really a good argument. Instead he should have said, \"Thanks for the ride and not drinking at the party! Appreciate you, dude!\"", "NTA\n\nYou were right to just follow her directions to make her feel safe/comfortable.  I don't really understand why your buddy was so upset about taking a different route (probably had something to do with him being drunk), he's just along for the ride and shouldn't be backseat driving.", "NTA - you handled it pretty much exactly as you should have.", "NTA you made the right decision to help her feel safe. Your \u201cfriend\u201d has some nerve getting mad at his designated driver for DRIVING.\n\nI\u2019d ditch the guy with the fragile ego. This won\u2019t be the last time he decides to be an AH for no reason.", "NTA but this seems like a situation with no real solutions. On the one hand, you taking her home seems super sketchy to anyone else. On the other hand, if you dont, shes stranded and vulnerable.", "NTA. You handled this perfectly and your friend sucks.", "NTA, you deviate from her path in her drunken state could be a big deal. She flips, calls 911 these guys are trying to kidnap me etc....\n\nYou did the right thing, getting her home safe, and following her crappy directions. Your buddy needs to calm the f down.

Friend of a Friend is a weirdo, tho.", "NTA: Nobody who calls you \"a cuck\" is worth the trouble they're going to cause you.", "NTA.

To a dark alley, etc.?\n\nYour friend lacks the smarts to understand yet he still decides to make a drama.", "He's mad you didn't listen to him...

Women are, without exaggeration, preyed on relentlessly just while going to get friggin' groceries, let alone when they're drunk/high, so good on you for making sure she felt comfortable and whatnot. Don't listen to the opinions of anyone who uses the word \"cuck\" outside of maybe an academic description of the sexual fantasy.

Good on you for looking out for someone in a vulnerable state.\n\nAlso, dude is letting his mask slip with his usage of \"cuck\".

I am thankful for men who think like you in this world.", "You took the route she was coherent enough to give.

I know having a friend of a friend put you down wasn't fun but you most likely made a girl feel *safe*. And that security means a lot to women when they spend time with someone. I think in the long run, being the provider of that security is going to mean much more to you as well. \n\nAlso, I vry seriously think he was just drunk and was upset he wasn't being listened to (ego \ud83d\ude44).
