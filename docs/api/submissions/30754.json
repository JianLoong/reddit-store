{"id": 30754, "submission_id": "17spruq", "title": "AITA for not clearing up a rumor about me?", "selftext": "When I (27f) was 23 I dated a guy named Ty. He was a virgin when we got together and didn't want to immediately have sex (he wasn't waiting til marriage or anything) which I agreed to for two months. Because I was dumb and stupid I ended up cheating on him at a party, got caught, and in the resulting fight blamed him for not giving me intimacy. We obviously broke up and he cut all contact with me. I never told anyone what initiated it but had no idea what he said about it.\n\nNot long after I found out I was pregnant. I told the father who agreed to co parent with me but didn't want a relationship. Fair enough. I gave birth to a beautiful boy and we hashed out an agreement that worked for our situation.\n\nFast foward a few days ago, I ran into an old friend that I had met through Ty, while out with my son. We chatted, catching up, and she asked how old my son was. She apparently did some quick math and figured out the timeline and asked quite boldly if he was Ty's and if that's why we broke up. I realized he had never explained *why* we broke up (nor had I told anyone that we never slept together) so it was logical for her to assume it was possible.\n\nHere's where I might have messed up. I didn't say yes but I also didn't come out and say no because I didn't know how to explain without dredging up bad memories. Instead I just said that my son's conception was at the center of it all.\n Yestrrday Ty reached out to me on Facebook demanding to know why I was lying about us having a child together and calling me psycho. I got pissed because I never said he was the father and told him to fuck off. He threatened me to tell the truth or he would and I blocked him. I decided not to say anything because I felt I hadn't done anything wrong.\n\nAm i the asshole for choosing not to explicitly say he's not the father?", "created_utc": 1699689253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17spruq/aita_for_not_clearing_up_a_rumor_about_me/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You let them misunderstand, you made it almost like it was a child 100% from man you cheated! UNCOOL!", "YTA - a simple \"no\" is all that was needed,\n\n\"Is he Ty's?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Then who's is he?\"\n\n\"No go area.\"\n\nJob done, you chose drama, you're an asshole", "YTA\n\nThere was zero reason for you not to say that Ty wasn't the father. You not only cheated on Ty, but you blamed him on your cruel actions, and now you let your friend believe Ty dumped you after you got pregnant with his child. You had done a lot wrong in this whole situation, and now you continue trash Ty's reputation to cover up for yours.", "YTA.  Cheating on Ty is one thing but to then make it seem like he\u2019s the father and that\u2019s why the break up happened is another level of cruel.  You could have just said \u201cno\u201d and carried on with the conversation, I assume that you knew that would make you look like the baddie in this scenario and thus chose to leave it ambiguous.", "YTA. Holy crap, are you the AH. \n\nSo you cheat on the poor guy, blame him, he\u2019s apparently a decent enough sort to not burn your name to everyone he knows, and how do you thank him? You mysteriously hint at him being a deadbeat who ran out on his kid. Wow. \n\nBe ready for whatever mutual friends you have left to stop talking to you.", "Oh come on. Do you just like drama in your life? YTA \ud83e\udee0", "YTA\n\nWhy would you knowingly run this guy's name through the mud? You knew what you were doing because you did it to try and deflect onto someone else. Having people in your friend circle accuse you of being a deadbeat dad is a horrible thing and damaging. \n\nYou should have denied it.", "Cheating on the guy wasn't enough, you need to make out like he abandoned you while pregnant? Do you really need an answer to this? Coz you know YTA", "YTA \n\nYou have a child, and are acting like a child. \n\nI guess Ty was right not to sleep with you. \n\nAnd despite all the harm you\u2019ve inflicted on this poor man, you are still harming him from afar. \n\nGet a grip.", "YTA.  No answer would have been a better choice than a vague answer that could be misinterpreted.  If you block Ty, you will not be able to do damage control.  Ty must be placated or this issue will never go away. Your innocent son could become collateral damage depending on who is in your social circle.", "yta. you didn\u2019t just let a rumour circulate, you were asked directly and heavily implied he was the father. stop fucking this guy\u2019s life up, he has done nothing to you and you have done more than enough to him.", "YTA. You should at least clear his name. You owe him that much.", ">Here's where I might have messed up.\n\nMight have messed up? MIGHT have messed up? The only way you could have messed up more is by actually stating the lie rather than lying by omission.  You must have known how that was going to be taken. But you didn't want to \"dredge up bad memories\" or, in normal language, make yourself look bad.  Frankly, I hope Ty does shout to the world why you broke up, because he's clearly done the decent thing and kept quiet, even though the breakup was 100% your fault. Have you not heard of vibrators?\n\nYTA, by the way.", "YTA. YTA from moment you cheated to the moment you wouldn't fess up about it. \n\nI feel so sorry for Ty through this whole thing.", "YTA, how hard is it to say it\u2019s not his? Not very.. I don\u2019t know why you were so neutral, which does imply it is his. Are you embarrassed that the father left you?", "YTA just a series of bad decisions and unfortunately Tye on the recieving end of them all.", "YTA\n\n304 behavior. Quit making people look bad because you couldn't stay off another guy's cock.", "YTA and 100% a dulusional psycho", "YTA. You absolutely did lie. A simple \u2018no he\u2019s not the father\u2019 would have sufficed and you wouldn\u2019t have needed to \u2018dredge up\u2019 anything.", "YTA for cheating.  YTA for allowing someone to have the impression that the guy you cheated on abandoned you when you got pregnant.", "A cheater and a liar by omission does mean YTA, and it\u2019s a HUGE AH move to imply someone you know isn\u2019t the father of your child is a deadbeat baby daddy. I hope he clears the air about you up and I hope he clears it up good, and I hope he crossed blocked you so that when you hear about it and you try to pop off at him he doesn\u2019t have to deal with you.", "YTA your lack of explanation inferred that he was the father, when the truth was you cheated on him and got pregnant with the cheatee!", "YTA. By trying to be ambiguous you fuelled the rumour, to protect your image at the expense of Ty's. You knew the truth, but the only people involved who know for sure are you, your son, the baby daddy and Ty, and your bad decision making shouldn't be affecting Ty's life in a renewed manner.", "Yeah, YTA. All you had to say is that it was a different guy. Now you\u2019ve got people thinking that Ty is a father who has nothing to do with his kid. You knew what you were doing; you didn\u2019t want people to know what you\u2019d done.", "YTA. The rumour is not about you. Worse, you were the one who started the rumour mill going when you did not deny your friend's conjecture that Ty is your son's father. It was so easy to say \"No, Ty is not my son's father\". Your excuse as to why you did not immediately clear things with your friend does not even make sense.", "YTA and if you are going to keep that child you need to grow up FAST.", "There are many reasons why you are the asshole, you obviously didn't like the guy to begin with, and you didn't respect whatever you had. \n\nI think Ty is better off with someone who actually cares and loves him, Best Leave Ty alone.\n\nDid you put Ty's name on the birth certificate? I hope not. \n\nBut you enjoyed watching him in pain.", "YTA. A cheater should be known to everyone, don't hide in the shadow like a coward when a better person than you have lies around them because of your actions.", "YTA. Big one.\n\nAll you needed to say to that friend was \"No, he is not his\". \n\nJesus, you cheated on the guy and now you do this? YTA", "Roasted! And rightfully so. What a lowy", "YTA poor TY dodged a massive bullet", "YTA \nHow hard is it to just say he isn\u2019t Ty\u2019s and leave it at that?!", "YTA. \n\n\u201cIs he Ty\u2019s?\u201d \n\n\u201cGod, no.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not that hard.", "He gave you a chance to make things right privately and you refused. So now, don\u2019t be surprised when he has to call you out publicly to clear his name.", "YTA, because you Make poor choices everytime. \n\nYou should really treat people better.", "Of course YTA, all you had to say was that Ty was not the father and that you have an amicable co-parenting relationship with your child's father. Your friend would instantly have assumed that your relationship after Ty resulted in this baby. There's no way anyone could instantly work out the date of conception based on the baby's age.  \n\nIt sounds like you preferred people to think that Ty was the father, rather than working out you cheated. You intentionally misled your friend, with no consideration for the consequences.", "YTA - You just don't want people to know that you and Ty broke up because you cheated. Now you ARE indeed spreading more rumors about Ty by not simply saying he is NOT the father. Really an AH to do that to someone that you once were dating. \n\nIt is easy enough to say that Ty is not the father.", "YTA , you straight up should've said no. If you didn't want to say more your choice , but not saying Ty isn't your child is weird", "Yeah, you sound like pure garbage to be honest.\n\nYTA, you cheated on this poor dude, turned around and said it was his fault, got knocked up and then didn\u2019t clear the air that it wasn\u2019t his kid making him look bad. \n\n\u201cThis is where I messed up\u201d \nNo, it wasn\u2019t. You messed up multiple times throughout the entire time \n\nYou know what you were doing each decision you made. Grow up.", "YTA. You made it sound vague. A reasonable person could take what you said and reach the conclusion that Ty got you pregnant and ditched. Pretty messed up considering the real reason he ditched you was because you cheated on him.", "YTA. All you needed to do was say \"no, he's not Ty's\" and that would be the end of it. Now he's got people thinking that he pulled a scummy move by getting you pregnant and then bailing. Sounds like you have some damage control to do because this isn't fair on Ty at all.", "YTA", "Is this even real? WTF", "You didn't give a damn about 'dredging up the past', you just didn't want everyone to know the truth and see you for the cheat you were. So you deliberately set it up to make it seem like Ty is a deadbeat dad. You're not just TA, you're also slimy and manipulative.", "YTA. What is wrong with you? It's not that hard to say \"no\". No further explanation needed. I suspect you hoped he would reach out to you when he found out you were letting that lie circulate.", "YTA, you should definitely have said no as it was 100% certain that Ty was not the father & this made him look like an AH because it makes it look like he did not want to take responsibility for his actions.\n\nYTA again for not simply coming out & saying that you cheated & that is why you broke up & the child was the result of you cheating & nothing to do with Ty, you made him look like the AH simply to save face & not own up to the consequences of your decision to cheat", "YTA. Completely.", "YTA, Your selfishness you don't want to dredge up from then, is the same selfishness you show now.  It isn't something in the past, it's you now.", "Yta.  I kind of feel like this post was written by an angry incel to validate his dislike of women, though.", "Nta, why does it concern her, they never tried to reach out", "Nta... can't really blame people that have mental problems..", "NTA Dude if someone said \"my son's conception was at the center of it all\" I would assume cheating. YOu did say \"Because of my son\" but I can see where there could be a misunderstanding. Ty, while upset, could approached you more civilly and asked what you said then explained his side so you two could clear it up. Like even if you said \"it's personal\" that other person probably would ahve stil ran wild. Though to be honest the best thing you could have just said is it's not Ty's and that's it.", "The \"old friend\"  is the asshole here.\nIf anything I would contact that person and straighten them out and tell them to mind their own business.", "NTA- but you might want to have a good chat with Ty,because it looks like your bad memories are going to get shared whether you want too or not", "NTA -- this information is not anyone's business but your own, and you're not responsible for anything that your friend decided to say.", "NTA \n\nYou are not obligated to provide private information to people. You don't owe anyone an explanation. Some people are so nosy.", "YTA for unnecessarily causing drama.  All you had to say was no.  Instead you have a vague ass answer that implied Ty was the father, then you get pissy with Ty over your bullshit.  \n\nAt some point the shitty behavior from you has to stop.", "\u201cYou hadn\u2019t done anything wrong\u201d \n\nSeriously!", "Oh the irony of you thinking you did nothing wrong lol\n\nYTA", "Whew to avoid being banned,  im just gonna say yta. However honestly you deserve to be absolutely roasted.", "\"No\" doesn't seem to be that hard of a word!?", "YTA big time and I am appalled you don\u2019t see that. You suck. Stop making problems for this guy.", "YTA", "I still can't believe her rationale for being ambiguous was \"I didn't know how to explain without dredging up bad memories.\"\n\nWe all know that this is just a flowery way of saying \"the truth makes me look bad so let me be vague in a way that I know will make Ty look bad.\"\n\nThen when she realised it was getting back to Ty and making him look like a deadbeat (not cool) she gets pissed and still doesn't accept her mistake. \n\nEverything she has done is AH worthy", "And she lied. Ty didn\u2019t break up with her because she was pregnant, he broke up with her because she cheated and blamed him for not sleeping with him.\n\nOP: you *can* make this right. You have wronged this guy in many ways. YTA big time. Life is long; now\u2019s a great time to start doing better.", "100%. Why else would it \"dredge up bad memories.\"", "It wasn't any of her business in my mind. I didn't think she'd run off and as Ty about it.", "For real. Very disappointing that in 4 years she didn\u2019t change for the better and is still making troubles for her ex", "Exactly, should be no misunderstanding about this.", "Or it could mean Ty got her pregnant and left her. She is most definitely an AH , as her vague response could make Ty look like a bad guy.", "To be clear, she doesn\u2019t have bad memories, Ty does.", "But you should be responsible to not tarnish someone's name, especially if it was you who was at fault in the first place...she could've just said it's none of your business when asked who the father was!", "Then say that\u2019s not your business?  Yea people are nosy but to leave a misguided preconceived notion unchecked when you were very much in the wrong, and hurt someone you supposedly cared about, is morally wrong.", "Exactly what I thought...what bad memories for her? She was the one who cheated. It should've been bad memories for ty.\n\nThen she goes on labelling him as the reason for the breakup in front of the other woman, making him look like a bad person/father when it was solely her fault for cheating and then gaslighting ty. The guy still tried to save her name despite everything though he wouldn't be at slightest of fault for disclosing the reason.\n\nHe still maintained decency and this is how she's shown her gratitude.\n\nAnd above all op thinks that she didn't do anything wrong by not denying if ty's the father. Touch some grass OP.\n\nYou're one of the biggest AH in this sub..", "Bro. You gave vague answers that imply its his\u2026. Wtf do you think was gonna happen?", "Then you should've directly told her so.\n\nJust because you 'assumed' she'd not ask ty about it, doesn't mean that you've got the right to throw someone innocent under the bus when it was you who messed up the relationship.\n\nAs if being a cheater wasn't enough, you were so cruel to the guy labelling him as the reason while he was decent enough to not blame you in front of the world for what you did in the past.\n\nAnd when confronted, instead of owning up and apologizing both for the past and present,you outrightly block the guy and still think you're not at fault??\n\nAre you for real OP? And then you're a parent yourself... oh god\ud83e\udd26", "so in your mind it\u2019s totally fine to lead people to think ill of him, and the only problem is that he found out. cool.", "You piqued her interest and didn't rule Ty out as the father, of course she asked him. Ty. Is. Not. The. Father. Five words that could have avoided all this. You made the decision four years ago, you need to own it in the here and now.\n\nFlip the script, say a friend of yours is cagey on the father of their kid, and you know they were dating someone at the likely time of conception who they aren't with anymore. Wouldn't you be curious?", "Ummm\u2026then why wouldn\u2019t you say that? Instead of just shutting it down, you made it sound juicy. Also, sounds like you cheating was the center of why you broke up, not you getting pregnant. You could have cheated and not ended up pregnant and Ty still would\u2019ve broken up with you. YTA - so, so clearly.", "Guess Ty needs to clear his name and tell everyone he knows why he broke up with you. It's not like you blocking him will stop him from telling the truth. It's none of your business what he does after all.", "But you KNEW she thought Ty was the father so what did you think would happen?!", "That\u2019s fine if that\u2019s how you feel, I just think you should have said \u201cthat\u2019s not your business\u201d then.  Comes across as you strengthening a confirmation bias by saying the pregnancy was at the center of the breakup.", "There\u2019s no way you\u2019re legitimately this simple.", "So you thought a simple \u201cno\u201d would invite more questions than \u201cmy son\u2019s conception is at the center of it all\u201d or whatever bs you said? Gtfoh with that nonsense, you knew what you were doin.", "It wasn't her business to know that you cheated on Ty or that you conceived on that occasion, but now you've opened the can of worms by misleading her.  You wanted to make Ty look bad by implying he abandoned his baby, now he has to defend himself by telling the truth. \n\nAll you had to say was \"No, it's not Ty's.\"", "YTA\n\nThis has to be the stupidest thing I\u2019ve read today!\n\nWTF is wrong with you OP? A simple no would have sufficed. What a strange thing to do. \n\nSo not only are you unfaithful, you purposefully gave a vague answer to Ty\u2019s friend.", "OP was out with her 4 yr old son. That is not the conversation to have in public. She neither confirmed nor denied the person's assumption. She isn't responsible for someone jumping to conclusions. She also isn't obligated to dash any, including telling someone to mind their business.", "She also thought \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex in 2 months so rather than talk about my needs with my boyfriend I\u2019ll cheat on him\u201d was sound logic.\n\nCheaters never any to take responsibility for their actions and want others to take the fall. Of course she thought implying Ty was the bad guy as opposed to exposing herself as a cheater was the better option.", "Except it's come around to affect an innocent man. He's clearly feeling his ears burning, and if he wants to clear the record and his name he can. If cheating on someone and having an affair baby is bad memories, imagine being the person cheated on because that's not a good memory."]}
