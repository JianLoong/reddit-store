He was a virgin when we got together and didn't want to immediately have sex (he wasn't waiting til marriage or anything) which I agreed to for two months. Because I was dumb and stupid I ended up cheating on him at a party, got caught, and in the resulting fight blamed him for not giving me intimacy. We obviously broke up and he cut all contact with me. I never told anyone what initiated it but had no idea what he said about it.\n\nNot long after I found out I was pregnant. I told the father who agreed to co parent with me but didn't want a relationship. Fair enough. I gave birth to a beautiful boy and we hashed out an agreement that worked for our situation.\n\nFast foward a few days ago, I ran into an old friend that I had met through Ty, while out with my son. We chatted, catching up, and she asked how old my son was. She apparently did some quick math and figured out the timeline and asked quite boldly if he was Ty's and if that's why we broke up. I realized he had never explained *why* we broke up (nor had I told anyone that we never slept together) so it was logical for her to assume it was possible.\n\nHere's where I might have messed up. I didn't say yes but I also didn't come out and say no because I didn't know how to explain without dredging up bad memories. Instead I just said that my son's conception was at the center of it all.\n Yestrrday Ty reached out to me on Facebook demanding to know why I was lying about us having a child together and calling me psycho. I got pissed because I never said he was the father and told him to fuck off. He threatened me to tell the truth or he would and I blocked him. I decided not to say anything because I felt I hadn't done anything wrong.\n\nAm i the asshole for choosing not to explicitly say he's not the father?", "created_utc": 1699689253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17spruq/aita_for_not_clearing_up_a_rumor_about_me/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cheating on Ty is one thing but to then make it seem like he\u2019s the father and that\u2019s why the break up happened is another level of cruel.

Holy crap, are you the AH. \n\nSo you cheat on the poor guy, blame him, he\u2019s apparently a decent enough sort to not burn your name to everyone he knows, and how do you thank him?

No answer would have been a better choice than a vague answer that could be misinterpreted.  If you block Ty, you will not be able to do damage control.

YTA for allowing someone to have the impression that the guy you cheated on abandoned you when you got pregnant.", "A cheater and a liar by omission does mean YTA, and it\u2019s a HUGE AH move to imply someone you know isn\u2019t the father of your child is a deadbeat baby daddy.

You intentionally misled your friend, with no consideration for the consequences.", "YTA - You just don't want people to know that you and Ty broke up because you cheated. Now you ARE indeed spreading more rumors about Ty by not simply saying he is NOT the father. Really an AH to do that to someone that you once were dating. \n\nIt is easy enough to say that Ty is not the father.", "YTA , you straight up should've said no.

You messed up multiple times throughout the entire time \n\nYou know what you were doing each decision you made. Grow up.", "YTA. You made it sound vague. A reasonable person could take what you said and reach the conclusion that Ty got you pregnant and ditched. Pretty messed up considering the real reason he ditched you was because you cheated on him.", "YTA. All you needed to do was say \"no, he's not Ty's\" and that would be the end of it.

WTF", "You didn't give a damn about 'dredging up the past', you just didn't want everyone to know the truth and see you for the cheat you were.

You didn't need to say who the father is but you should have said no because he isn't the father\nYou know like a grown up, hope your ex clears up all that cheating stuff", "Stop making excuses for yourself, you deliberately misrepresented the situation to hurt Ty. \n\n\nClearly you never changed, you are still cheating, lying trash", ">I didn't think it was her business\n\nRight, so why not tell her that? Why not say that it's someone you met AFTER you broke up with Ty? You deliberatly let her believe it was Ty and made him look like he abandoned you while pregnant. \n\nYou are just stirring up drama, don't you think you've hurt your ex enough? I hope he decides to tell everyone the truth, because the truth is the reason you're lying. You know once your honest about what happened, people will never look at you the same again, and at this point, you deserve it.", "No he\u2019s not the father and quite frankly it\u2019s none of your business. There that\u2019s clear and simple and to the point. It answers the question and stops anymore. But what you did was lie by omission. You dodged it so that you wouldn\u2019t look bad. Now when he tells everyone the truth you will look even worse.", ">Like I said, I didn't think it was her business. She didn't have to ask who the father was because she didn't need to know.\n\nIf you didn't think it was her business, then why did you answer at all? You could have just told her that instead of offering a vague answer that was obviously going to lead her to the conclusion she had. Bc the *only* things she's going to think are either it's Ty's or that you did cheat on him, bc otherwise why else would the baby be the reason for the breakup? It's really hard for us to believe that's not what you wanted. \n\nEspecially bc there would have been no issue with you saying \"no it's not his,\" qnd not giving any more information. Hell, even if you had straight up lied and said it happened after, that would have been better. \nYou wouldn't have to admit to cheating or anything-just bc her math lead to *around* the time you were dating Ty didn't mean it couldn't have happened after the breakup. So why would you willingly give an answer that would have put either you or Ty in a bad position by implying that Ty skipped out on being a father or that you cheated on him?\n\nEspecially especially bc what you said was a lie. I doubt Ty had a *clue* you were pregnant when you guys broke up-that would have been way too soon. Did *you* even know you were pregnant at the time? I really can't understand this rationale bc now, you've just outed yourself as a cheater when that surely can't be what you wanted. \n\n>I still feel it wasn't enough for her to go ask him about it like it involved her\n\nI mean, if they're still friends, you do realize that friends talk to each other about stuff like this, right? Do you think if you had a friend who believed you might have a secret kid, one you might not know about-pretending you're a man for a bit, of course-they would just never tell you? \n\nWhat were you expecting, that she was no longer friends with Ty? Did you truly, honestly think this wouldn't get back to him? For someone who didn't want to bring up memories of the past, you certainly put yourself in a position where you were forced to face it.", "Didn\u2019t you lie tho? You said that your son\u2019s contraception was the reason for the breakup.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t. You cheated. You\u2019re just a liar. Be honest now.", "A simple \u201cno he is not\u201d or just \u201cno\u201d was good enough to say", "Should you pretend he abandoned you while pregnant? Do you really need an answer to this?", "Hey asshole! It\u2019s trashy and inappropriate to let someone think someone is the father of your kid. \n\nWhat\u2019s even scarier is you\u2019re supposed to be a parent. Someone like you and your \u201cethics\u201dshouldn\u2019t be raising a child.\n\nI hope he blows up your spot on all social media. And tells the truth about why yall broke up too.", "Girl.\n\nThe cheating wasn\u2019t \u201cdumb and stupid,\u201d it was part of a pattern. A pattern you clearly haven\u2019t broken. You act in the moment based on what *you* want, without considering the potential consequences for anyone else. You were cagey about your child\u2019s paternity for the same reason you cheated on Ty - you just couldn\u2019t be bothered to think about how your actions would affect someone else, and once again, you *blamed him* for *your* behavior. \n\nYou have not changed a bit in the past four years. Eventually you\u2019re going to have to stop blaming \u201cstupidity\u201d and start owning the fact that you\u2019re actually just selfish and mean.", "That doesn\u2019t make sense. If it wasn\u2019t any of her business, you had all the more reason to just say \u201cno\u201d rather than incriminate Ty.", "Oh please, you knew what you were doing. YTA and a cheater and a liar.", "you knew exactly what you were fucking doing. none of us give a shit that after 4 years you still aren't interested in owning up to having been a cheater. you knew full damn well what your 'the baby was at the center of it' comment was gonna do. fucking grow up. how are you 27 and still this God damn immature?", "If you\u2019d said to her \u201cthat isn\u2019t any of your business\u201d, it would have been a better answer.", "Then you say that. You don't imply that he is the father. You're just an AH in general and not just for this. Also can't believe you're in your late 20s. You sound like a child.\n\nYTA. And a major one.", "Then just say it, say Ty's not the dad.  Its simple. \n\n You've been messing with him for a few years now, your baby daddy doesn't even want a relationship with you. You said you think you've done nothing wrong, time for some introspection, and amends.\n\n Good thing you cheated on him so quickly so he could get out and away from you as fast as he could and your still dragging his name through the mud.", "If it's none of her business then you say \"Wow, that's really a personal question and none of your business!\" rather than implying that yes, Ty is a deadbeat dad.", "Oh, so you just didn\u2019t think you\u2019d get caught.\n\nNot surprised you cheated. You\u2019re obviously someone who just does what\u2019s easiest for you and to hell with the consequences. Man, you suck. So glad Ty got out. Time for him to tell everyone the truth about what a horrid person you are. YTA", "For future reference you\u2019re allowed to just say \u201cno, he\u2019s not the father. I met him after the breakup.\u201d", "If you didn't think it was any of her business, why didn't you shut it down instead of ambiguously implying Ty was the father?

Second the friend assumed, according to the story the friend never flat out asked if Ty was the father.  \n\nSo what part of what she did says she has to openly reveal she was a terrible gf, nothing.\n\nHer choices are between her and the people involved, as shitty as they are", "She may have even regressed.", "i realise we have grown to uncomfortable with discomfort and while a natural instinct is to shy away from it and the growing mindset of \u201cnot owing others anything\u201d or \u201cputting ourselves first\u201d \u2014 which i do support!\u2014 has been twisted into well, this.", "And she\u2019s asking about clearing up a rumor!

Ty and ask him what's a way they can clear up the misunderstandings and nobody thinks that he's the dad but at the same time doesn't expose her, and who knows, she might not be able to get what she wants. She might just have to be exposed as a cheater. But her only course of action to resolve this issue in a way that gets what she wants, deserving or not, is to talk to the man she cheated on, and ask him to keep her secret.\n\nWhat part of any of this says she has to share anything about how her daughter was conceived? Everyone is getting hung up on the fact she is a cheater. Yes, that makes her an a****** on that part but not sharing information on the how and why her son was born is completely up to her. She did not lie about who the father was, did she? It wasn't like she was running around town saying Ty is the dad. She's just not saying who the father is and that is up to her", "There's nothing I'm not understanding, however, the title of this post wasn't \"AITAH for cheating on this guy\", The title was \"AITAH for not clearing up a rumor\" \n\nEveryone here is so focused on the fact that she cheated that they're missing the main question\n\nShe has no obligation to anyone to clear this rumor, because that is what it is. Nothing more than a rumor. She was not the one that spread the rumor, that was the friend. The friend who misinterpreted what she said. The friend could have asked for clarification but she didn't, she jumped into assumptions. And rightfully so.  OP did not do herself any favors to avoid these rumors.\n\nBut now that these rumors are spreading, Ty who knows this rumor to be 100% false, has gone to OP and say you clear this up or I will.\n\nNow as things stand, people are going to assume that ty is the father.  Ty will then reply. No, I'm not. OP cheated.  To this OP will then either confirm that tie is not the father thus telling the truth, or she will lie and say he is. If she decides to lie then she will unequivocally be an AH. \n\nBecause she wants to avoid telling people she cheated, this is where my comment comes in saying if you don't want people to know, The only person you can hope to help you in this is Ty.  To which Ty has no obligation to help her, but all she can do is ask.\n\nNow if she tells the truth People will find out she cheated.\n\nThus making it way worse than if she would have just said no. The baby is not Ty's\n\nAnd that at the heart is what she was asking, is she an a-hole for not clearing up a rumor.  Rumors are spread for any number of reasons but she was not the reason why it spread, she was not the architect. She deliberately left out information because she was embarrassed about her previous actions.  She had no obligation to share that she cheated on Ty.  She had no obligation to share who the baby was.\n\nThis is the point I'm trying to get across. I am not condoning her actions for cheating. That alone is more than enough to call someone an AH.  But the main question is is it her responsibility to fix a rumor that she didn't start.  And to that i do not believe she is an AH", "wow. you have got some issues. her bf wanted to wait so he's an insecure pathetic incel?

I'm sure you and op would get along swimmingly.", "*how many partners did you cheat on?* \n\nNone. I have never had any partners, as I am ugly and have an unpleasant personality. But I have also never forced anyone to wait on my conveniences.  I doubt that I would get along with OP, as I don't get along with people in general.", ">None. I have never had any partners,\n\nunsurprising then, that you do not understand how relationships work. no one is entitled to sex, even from their partner, and if op had an issue with her bf wanting to wait, the solution was *not* to agree to wait to have sex and then cheat on him, but to tell him that that didn't work for her and leave and find someone she was compatible with. there is nothing empowering about how op handled this, nor is her ex pathetic, insecure, or an incel just because he wanted to wait. plenty of guys actually don't think about sex 24/7. some have low sex drives and some are *gasp* asexual. regardless of his reasons for waiting, she agreed to them, and then like the asshole she is, cheated and tried to blame him for her choices. she is not an example of female empowerment. she's just another cheating asshole."]}
