{"id": 32404, "submission_id": "18be009", "title": "AITA for not wanting my brother around my kids after allowing my 6yr old to use his vape?", "selftext": "My 10yr old daughter disclosed tonight that my brother (39M) let her \"use\" his vape pen when she was 5 or 6 years old.  \nA serious discussion followed. I made sure she knew she did nothing wrong and I appreciate her sharing this with us (she told my wife first). My daughter described how my brother was holding the vape pen and let her use it with her mouth. I asked follow-ups: did you breathe anything in? did you feel uncomfortable or unsafe in any way? She told me as much as she could remember, but it was far from perfect.  \nI immediately called my parents. My brother has had addiction problems for the last 15 years or so - he lives with my parents and so I asked them to step somewhere private for the call. Upon telling my mom the situation, she replied, \"I can't imagine him doing that.\" She admitted it was bad, but seemed unlikely. I then talked with my dad, who said I should get my brother's side of the story - and even if it did happen the way my daughter described, my brother has been in a very different place for the past 3 months. Their reactions were not what I was hoping for. I trust both my children with all my heart, my first instinct is to believe them fully.  \nI then video call my brother so I could pick up on body language. He picks up and first thing goes into admission. He honestly came clean, and I fully believe him. He said that my daughter had asked about his vape pen multiple times over the course of several weeks. He wanted to relieve some of her curiosity in a safe way while also emphasizing that she is not to use it at her age. He then let her hold it up to her lips. She did not \"push the button\" and did not inhale anything. He said he shouldn't have let her and apologized. I then described how this could have been worse, but this is still bad.  \n\"Why is it bad?\" he asked.  \n\"Nicotine is a drug!\" I reply, heated.  \n\"So is sugar!\" he retorts.  \nI tell him that this is the time for him to apologize and admit fault and change behavior rather than try to \"rationalize a bunch of bullshit.\" I also explain that just because the cigarette isn't lit does not mean that you should teach a 5 or 6 year old how to use it.  \nI explain how sugar, alcohol, nicotine and all other sorts of drugs should be handled by parents first. \"We educate our kids on how to properly read nutrition labels on the back of food, too. I do not want these things happening in a private corner of a bedroom away from us. It was not your place to teach her.\"  \nThe conversation ended with my brother apologizing and with half-assed \"i love you's\" from both of us before I said I needed to talk more with my wife before deciding what is next.  \nAt this point, I am only comfortable with my brother around my kids if my wife and I are present. I do not want him alone with my kids. My children are VERY close with my parents. And so it breaks my heart, but I am considering staying elsewhere this Christmas. I also feel as though my parents are not taking this seriously enough.  \nAm I the asshole?  \n", "created_utc": 1701789085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18be009/aita_for_not_wanting_my_brother_around_my_kids/", "score": 122, "replies": ["NTA\n\n6 years old is extremely young. This is a big deal and you should be taking steps to distance your children from him.", "NTA - you are 100% justified in not letting your brother be alone with your kids after this. I would not trust the parents after their reaction either. This is not the time to downplay the situation. Next time it\u2019s going to be a sip of alcohol or something worse. \n\nRuining Christmas should be the least of your concerns, protecting your kids has to always be your first priority. you are not wrong or overreacting.", "NTA - but a question.\n\nyour 10 yr old told you about this thing that happened 4 or 5 yrs ago. Has anything else happened since then?\n\nI guess my answer on the going forward depends on the answer to that question. Your brother was wrong, no doubt about it. He didn't deny it and apologized for it. Your parents protected him and diminished it, which was AH behavior. \n\nBut what does denying your kids Christmas with their grandparents accomplish at this point? Honestly, it may backfire and make your daughter decide it's better to not tell you things because then you'll keep her away from her grandparents. She's absolutely old enough to put together the cause and effect here. You'll be present to monitor that nothing happens. \n\nI do agree with not leaving the kids alone with any of them for the foreseeable future as they will have to earn back your trust. And being straight up with your parents about why they are no longer allowed unsupervised visitation is a must.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are enabling your brother's issues, as can be seen by them immediately trying to downplay your concerns and brush them off. Your children likely aren't safe around them, either.", "The title alone made it clear NTA, I read the post anyway though and it\u2019s clear not only are your children not safe around your brother but probably not around your parents either for enabling it.", "NTA\n\nYour title pretty much sums up why.", "NTA, bro is the ahole here. Vape not good for kids, even if it was just holding up to lips. You doing right thing by keeping an eye on your brother around ur kids. Fuck nicotine and fuck sugar too i guess lol", "I'm sitting here reading this story lit cigarette in hand, guess who also had a family member \"relieve\" some of my curiosity when I was about 5 yrs old. Guess what same adult gave me a cig or two at 12 yrs old. Guess what same adult bought me cigs at 16 yrs old. \n\nNTA poor judgment doesn't go away in a few months, he would need to prove it for years.", "Ok, so, this happened 4 or 5 years ago. Your daughter never inhaled nicotine, just puffed on the vape. While what he did isn't the smartest idea, you need to let this go. No real harm was done and I assume she's been around your brother for the past 4 to 5 years with no problems. You've expressed your displeasure and he's apologized so I think you should leave it be...and if you're really that worried about it, make sure she's not left alone with him.", "NTA - you have no grounds right now to trust your child's safety amongst him. That may change over time, but right now you gotta protect your daughter", "Lol your brother tried to use the :\"Bill Clinton defense\" where he took a hit *but didnt inhale*.\n\nGet out of here with that bullshit.  Your brother has remarkably poor judgement and you are not at fault for your reaction.   What kind of Jerry Springer values did your brother teach your kids?  Its inexcusable and dysfunctional.  NTA", "But she didn\u2019t inhale any nicotine right? Never turned it on?  So nothing actually happened", "I'd say your the assh*le.  \n\nIt's not a problem to be upset and yell/talk to him.  Be disappointed in him. But he didnt let her \"really\" use it, and he apologized.  I'm sure he'll never do it again.  AND It was 4 yrs ago! And then to deny him unclehood is rediculas.", "Nta, if this happened to me I would have reported my brother for providing nicotine products to a child", "\"Why is it wrong? Sugar is a drug!\" This is all you need to know. You informed your brother how he (obviously) violated a safety boundary, and his reply indicates he doesn't respect the boundary and will do as he chooses. \n\nSounds like the type where he takes other people's boundaries and decides they're a personal affront to him, specifically. \n\nNTA, do not let him unsupervised around your kids.", "NTA. Good lord.", "NTA\n\nThis is a hill to die on. Iwo Jima.\n\nNicotine is one of the most addictive drugs there is. Vapes are designed to give a much higher blast of nicotine than any cigarette and addiction happens much faster and more intensely than with any cigarette.  If you have any doubts about this, talk to your daughter's pediatrician.\n\nAnother danger is social.\n\nIf/When your kid talks about this to other kids, the story may get twisted into you being a negligent parent. Worse, some of the children may be impressed by what your kid tells them and give her a message that being able to talk about nicotine, other drugs and transgressive behavior is glamorous and a source of popularity.\n\nYour brother is still an unrecovered addict. He may be abstinent but his rationalizing mentality is still that of an addict and he is in danger of relapse and not good company in any case.", "this is called \u201cforgive but not forget.\u201d  Just cause he said \u201csorry\u201d doesnt mean he gets a do-over.", "For her to be persistently curious about his vape, wouldn\u2019t he have to be using it around her? That would be a huge problem.", "NTA.\n\nClear child endangerment.", "Nope NTA and if I were you I wouldn\u2019t let your parents be with them unsupervised either", "I agree with this. OP, your kid is going to feel like you punished her for sharing this with you - even though that is not your intention.", "This", "> just puffed on the vape\n\nShe didn't even inhale! She put her lips to it and that was it.", "Seems like an overreaction. Kids are relentless. She essentially put a usb in her mouth. Like giving a kid apple juice in a wine glass", "I smoke cigarettes, would that mean I'd be okay if I allowed my nephews to have a suck on one as long as it's not lit? I mean, I'd never, but it seems some people are saying this is all fine because she didn't inhale anything...", "Yeah, this is a pretty stupid one. His brother seems to have handled it exactly the way child psychologists recommend. You don't make something forbidden and scary, that only makes kids want to do it more. It's pretty clear analog to letting your kids have a sip of wine, versus telling them it's only for adults; except in this case, the child's curiosity was assuaged without even having any alcohol! It was perfectly safe.", "NAH - I'm not gonna call you an asshole but this is an extreme overreaction. The way your brother handled the situation is disagreeable but sound. Your child, as far as I understand, never ingested nicotine. Also, and I can't emphasize this enough, it happened four years ago! The fact that you   don't won't to visit them on Christmas over this I can't understand, and it makes me think there are other issues here.", "Sounds like you two made up for the most part, but I don't begrudge you wanting to watch him around her. NTA", "NTA. HOWEVER, your brother did fess up and only started defending himself when he felt like you were attacking him. That sounds like he's making some personal growth, so you may want to go a little easier on him. Try to keep in mind he's fighting his own battle right now.\n\nStill, the incident DID take place. It's only prudent to not leave your children unsupervised with him. Actions are more powerful than words, so hopefully he can continue to earn back your trust and eventually develop a healthy relationship with you and your children.", "NTA.  Two reasons.  First, he absolutely shouldn't be vaping around and normalizing vapes to children.  But second, if he'll do this with a six year old, how old will they be before he'll agree to give them a puff or buy some for them because they're \"curious\"?  And what about other substances?   It is very common for people who struggle with addiction to have it normalized in their family and/or start young.  You can't trust him around kids.  Nor your parents as they see this as a non-issue.\n\nYou should be proud your daughter trusted you enough to confide this though.  Obviously, you are doing something right if she felt safe enough to tell you something like this.  I'd make sure she understands that any consequences for your family are not her fault for telling.  They behaved badly and it was right to reveal this.  Your brother's attitude indicates he may say shit.", "Without a doubt, YTA. So is your brother but only a little for using poor judgmet.  \nSugar is not a drug.  \nCaffeine is a drug. Do you allow your daughter to drink soda or eat chocolate?? You're the one exposing her to drugs!  \nAnyway, FOUR or FIVE years ago your brother tried to dispel some of the mystery surrounding the vape pen to deal with your daughter's curiosity. By all accounts, it doesn't seem that she did anything but hold it.  \nWhat do you expect your parents to do? Do you want them to go ballistic? Do you want them to throw a fit and toss your brother out? Would that satisfy you?   \nIf this was the only transgression then your reaction is kind of irrational.", "NTA. Your parents are rug sweeping like no tomorrow.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA you wouldn\u2019t do that with a cigarette even if the kid was curious and teaching her how a vape pen works doesn\u2019t lead anywhere healthy.", "NTA. You have the right to do what you want with your children. As a parent your only jobs are to love them, teach them, and protect them. Also giving a child sugar is not the same as giving them nicotine.", "NTA, don't let your parents around your kids anymore! Obviously the brother too, but the parents were ready to call your daughter a liar to protect your brother.", "Six!???? Your child is hardly old enough to play with legos safely.", "NTA, is reasoning is completely flawed and he knows it. You are 100% valid in not wanting him to be around your kids. She was quite literally 5-6 when he decided to risk giving her nicotine. You are justified without a doubt.", "YTA Just don't leave him alone with your kid.", "NTA \u201che told me i should get my brother\u2019s side of the story\u201d oh right, because it\u2019s obviously the 6 year old\u2019s for practically hitting a dab pen in your brother\u2019s possession! \ud83d\udc80 glad he realized it was wrong though, and it could have gone much worse", "NTA.\n\nYou're making the exact response and taking the exact measures that you should.  Do not stay there, stay somewhere else.  And as much as it sucks, that means they can't be left with your parents if he's living there.  Actions have consequences, this is one.", "Yeah, nothing actually happened. What OP\u2019s brother did was kind of dumb, but no real harm was done. Reddit just loves hating on cigarettes and vapes for some reason.", "Not related to the topic at hand but, I'm genuinely curious, if you suck on a new, unlit cigarette, do you get anything other than air? Can you taste any of the herb?\n\nOn topic, I'm not saying that what the brother did was a Good Thing\u2122, but in the grand scheme of things, does this really rise above the level of saying \"That's stupid. Please don't do it again\"? There are so many more dangerous things that people regularly do with their kids/grandkids. Think about the generations of parents that used Whiskey to soothe babies while teething.", "The person that answered you down below isn't being truthful, especially for a decades long smoker they claim to be. Puffing on an unlit cigarette barely taste of anything beyond air. Have you ever smiled wood mulch? That's about what regular, unlit tobacco smells like or \"tastes\" like. And it's not all that strong of a smell either.", "It tastes like absolute ass. I'm not saying cigarettes in general taste \"good\", but if you are a smoker you do like that flavour. Accidentally trying to take a drag from a cigarette that's not lit is absolutely awful. And I say that as a decade long smoker.\n\nWhile you're right in that people used to (and still do) some ridiculously dumb things when it comes to kids, that's not really an excuse though. People also used to smoke absolutely everywhere because quite frankly we were for many years dumb when it comes to the dangers that it comes with. Not letting a kid suck on your cigarette for me isn't about the danger that one attempt at a drag is going to pose, but rather the bad image it can promote. I don't even smoke around my nephews, because I don't want them to get any form of idea that this is ever a good thing or a cool thing or whatever else.", "misinformation. my parents were both smokers and my dad waved cigs in my face, i was around packets from a young age etc. the actual smell of smoking and what it left behind was always yucky and i didnt want to be near it but id inhale the smell of the unlit tobacco in the packs so deeply, it smells quite different and pleasant. like a deep woody smell but richer."]}
