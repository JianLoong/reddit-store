But around two days ago he said I have to stop and when I asked why he told me it's because he doesn't feel safe someone talking a rough language like mine. I got confused and told him that this is an opportunity my child to know more than the average American. He got all defensive about my comment and left to his parents house.\n\nNow my in-laws are calling me the AH for not validating his feelings and I'm all alone in a country I don't wanna be but still came because of my husband not wanting to live in the UK where we met.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: I forgot to say that my husband has been very involved in my native culture and really likes the traditional food. His reaction is only to the language!\n\nLittle update: I called my husband around 10 minutes ago and told him that we need to talk this through (mind you he is still in his parents house and came once to see our daughter and to get his work laptop). He agreed and said that he'll come after work so there is still around 4 hours untill he comes.

Your husband is being selfish and should be happy his daughter is learning about culture and language", "NTA. Your husband is one though. \n\nYour daughter has every right to know about her culture and the language, and you have every right to teach it to her.", "Did mommy's boy get his feelings hurt cause you didn't bow down to his wishes? I love how he ran home to mommy to defend him. Keep teaching your daughter and maybe find someone better for a father. This one still needs mommy. You deserve better than a crybaby.", "NTA. And I'm terrified for you that you even have to wonder this. You're sharing your culture with your daughter and, not only does your husband want you to stop, he also insults it. Your husband also screams immaturity to me- feeling \"unsafe\" because his wife is talking, needing you to agree with him in order to \"validate\" his feelings, rushing to his parents' house when you point out that he only knows one language...Then the fact that his family stepped in makes me think you've married a man who's still in the middle of being raised while the two of you have to raise your child.\n\nIdk what to tell you, girl, other than you're not at fault here. However, since you are alone in a country you don't like with a husband and in-laws like that, I'd make sure I make a support system/plan B in case things start to go further south.", "Absolutely NTA, you're giving your daughter more opportunities for the future. I think your husband might be a little insecure about the fact that you'll both be speaking the language he doesn't. I can understand where he's coming from, maybe offer him to teach him as well as your daughter so he doesn't feel left out.", "NTA he doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel safe\u201d because it\u2019s a \u201crough language\u201d? He\u2019s starting to sound a little racist to me. Why did he marry you if he doesn\u2019t like your primary language??? Your in laws need to back off because his feelings are not valid.", "NTA. Too many Americans are small minded about \u201cforeign\u201d languages. Being the child of immigrants myself, and having spoken Chinese before English, I can say the chances are that your kid won\u2019t be fluent in your native tongue. But exposing them as much as possible in the home while they are young will be an advantage to them later on. You are doing a good thing. Your husband and in-laws are foolish to not see this.", "NTA\n\nYou took a huge gamble on your life when you decided to move in a country \"you don't even like to live\".\n\nYour child now has US citizenship, if you ever were to divorce your husband, I don't even think you'd be allowed to leave the country with your child to go back in UK :(\n\nYou are stuck and he knows it, so he's acting like an asshole. There is nothing wrong with your child learning your language and with knowing the culture her mother comes from.", "NTA. At all. Why would your husband rob your daughter of such an opportunity? It puts her ahead in a major way. \u201cRough language\u201d that\u2019s bullshit; the Balkan languages are awesome. Maybe he\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll talk behind his back, but that\u2019s his insecurity and problem then.", "NTA -  He knew who you were before you got together; where you come from, your native language etc. Why is broadening your daughter's capability all of a sudden a problem?\nHis reason was complete BS. I was also born in the U.S. but my parents instilled my culture & being bilingual opened a lot of doors for me. \n\nReminds me of my MIL who made the comment regarding my son learning his second language  \"well he needs to know English to communicate with grandma\" ya no shit he'll know English we live in America. My husband didn't stay quiet about his own desire for him to learn a second language so his support meant everything. \nI'm sorry to say your husband is the AH.", "NTA. This is...racism or prejudice. Either way, that \"rough language\" is literally your language.", "He\u2019s a dick. My partner speaks French with her child, so sexy when she does. I can\u2019t understand anything.", "NTA.\n\nThere are only upsides to being raised bilingual. Bilingual children tend to perform better in academia.\n\n\nNot only that but why shouldn't you be able to help your daughter maintain a connection to her culture? Imagine if you guys moved to your home country, wouldn't it be ridiculous if you got mad at your husband for teaching his own kid English??", "NTA. you daughter deserves to have some semblance of culture/language from your side of the family. i only wish my mom had done the same! teaching kids languages earliest you can is better.\n\nwhen you mean \u201crough\u201d language, it sounds demeaning. balkan languages can be really pretty (better than plain English) and sound interesting in my own opinion. i think your American Husband may insecure in some way. maybe he\u2019s worried that he\u2019ll be left out of conversations? oh well. doesn\u2019t mean he should be rude about it. maybe he\u2019ll know what it\u2019s like not to be included for once.", "NTA your husband is being racist/xenophobic the red flag are rolling out like a carpet.", ">I'm from a Balkan country\n\nAs someone who is together with someone from the Balkans, NTA.  \n\n\n>and **he let me do it**.

There are oft jokes about son and I scheming behind his back but all in fun and in time he will likely pick up on the language purely through osmosis\n\nYour husband is TA for trying to disconnect your daughter from her heritage and family with the only reason being its 'Rough'", "NTA, I was raised with 3 languages and while I only really use 2 of them regularly I am thankful for all of them. Languages open new doors to opportunities, ontop of that its also just cool being able to travel places and communicate with people you otherwise couldnt have. As for the \"roughness\", that seems silly, German is considered angry by some but personally I find it beautiful given I understand it.", "NTA. i think your husband would have been proud to have a bilingual daughter. You are recognizing your life and your heritage, just like you are teaching your child english from his culture.\n\ni am concerned he ran back to his parents and cried on their shoulder to tell you what to do.\n\nsit down and talk to him. He starting to sound a bit racist and controlling.
