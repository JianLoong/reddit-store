If it\u2019s the latter and nothing that could be related to your treatment of women or potential to be abusive/violent then I think he needs to get over it.

Maybe ask her how she would react if someone continuously held the stupidest/worst thing she ever did against her.  Once you\u2019ve had the conversation, discuss how you will handle this going forward, whether that is her talking to her brother now, you not socializing with him, making him repeat and explain his comments to her if he always does it behind her back (I.e. if he makes a similar comment to the one you mentioned go over to her and tell her hey BIL just expressed concerns about our relationship and I wanted to give you the chance to address his concerns\u201d), etc.  \n\nUltimately you need to do this sooner than later because this has the potential to become an issue in your marriage and ultimately drive a wedge between you, especially if she takes her brother\u2019s side", "I'm going to say esh, there's an adult way of having a conversation about this issue.
