You probably think you're a good guy but the jury is very much out.  Perhaps her family will never accept you and be waiting to be proved correct", "NTA - but the brother isn\u2019t at issue here, Anna is. \n\nNo one can get her brother to back off except her telling him to. She is an adult woman with a husband, with this man running around attempting to defend her virtue.\n\nShe needs to let him know that she is capable of making her own decisions, and is honestly behaving as if he doesn\u2019t trust *her* judgement in partner.\n\nI have a pretty hard and fast rule that each partner deal with issues with their family. Me going to my partners sibling, parent, or other family member will likely never go successfully as I do not know them or their communication style as well as my partner does. We are going into those conversations together. My partner needs to be there with me to support and back me up, just as I would need to do the inverse if it was with my family.", "NTA - sounds like a wife problem to me. She should be sticking up for you and telling her brother enough is enough", "Just say you\u2019re going as Jesus.", "NTA but your wife is. She isn\u2019t speaking up to her brother and setting boundaries. If the shoe was on the other foot how would she feel?", "NTA", "I'm guessing because of your criminal history- this is why he's behaving like this?  He has every right to be concerned (depending on your crime.  If it was for pot.  I'm guessing he wouldn't be act like this.)  Look at is from his shoes, would you be concerned about your little sister?  \n\nYour wife should be the one to say something to her brother, not you...\n\nUnfortunately well you may have served your time, a lot of ppl will always look at you side ways.", "NTA.  You need to talk to Anna about this and have her talk to Mark.", "Ah the consequences of having a criminal history. Imagine that. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nmaybe you should have thought of the future when you commit your crimes, now you have to live with the consequence.\n\nand for the record 1 years married is nothing if he still do it in 20 years you'll have the right to complain", "ESH. You were both drunk and said things you would not had you been sober. Be the bigger man and apologize to make peace. Not because you were wrong, but because it will make life easier for your wife. And obviously dont drink with Mark again, ever. \n\nBtw, congrats on putting your criminal history in the past. Its wonderful to hear about people who turn the corner and make real positive changes in their lives. Not everyone can, so it speaks volumes about your good character that you have. Keep the faith, brother!", "ESH You both acted like angry toddlers. At the very least I do feel like you owe Mark an apology for how you reacted, but I would also bring up to him that his repeatedly bringing up your past the way he does is not OK. But you need to do it like an adult don\u2019t be getting in his face and antagonizing fights,  be mature about it.", "SHe should not have pressured OP in this double date weekend knowing OP and her bro do not get along.", "Yeah we have only been married a year, but we were dating for three. I think he thought that we would eventually break up or something, idk. His weird speeches amped up when we got married.", "It's insulting to Anna to speak like the BILbis because it implies that she doesn't have great judgement and is in need of help and protection, rather than an independent adult.\n\nOP has made mistakes in the past, pretty big ones, but is trying to move past these. BIL banging on about them is not helpful to anyone.\n\nNTA", "What happened to 'debt to society paid' then?\n\nGuess the bro doesn\\`t believe in that?  \nAlso - he had issues with this setup but the wife of 1 whole year ignored his feelings, and seems to now blame him for this happening?\n\nAnd, the bro dude followed OP to nag ? Yeah - not buying it - bro was an AH", "And OP \"got in his face\"? This is not a mature response, even if the BIL was overstepping massively.", "It may not sound that bad to us, but I'm sure after the 10th or 20th time it gets to be really bothersome. I wouldn't put up with it either.", "True, could have dated for one month, 6 months, 5 years\n No telling with the info", ">trust that his sister made the right choice in marrying you.\n\nShe might have. But I\\`m beginning to think OP might have made a mistake.", "Op said in another comment it was a burglary w/o assault that he got a 1 year sentence for btw :)", "Then this was the worst Moment he could pick.", "That makes it *worse*. You don't directly confront the abuser, ever. All it does it serve to make yourself feel better while the person being abused goes home with their abuser who is now furious and feels humiliated and wants someone to take it out on.\n\nIf he thought she was being abused, he could directly ask her. Again, she is an adult. He can voice his concerns to her. People in abusive relationships still have autonomy. It's an awful situation to care for someone and watch them stay in an abusive relationship, but ultimately, you can't *force* them to leave. You can offer them a place to stay, money, legal help, and a safe place to confide in, but you have to respect their autonomy. Not doing so pushed them further into their abuser's arms and feeds into what their abuser is telling them about people judging them and the relationship and adds a level of shame making them less likely to leave and further isolate themselves", "This.  NTA", "That may have been mentioned a few times lol", "Yeah. It was a dumb mistake I made when I was 21.", "rich family, burglary you really have no idea why people might be concern ??", "Sometimes where a pair is siblings don't get the parental needs met they will look to one another to fill that need. It can get really weird and cross boundaries. Sometimes it will even appear incest like, or even crossing that boundary. I don't think you have that issue with you wife, but maybe that's where BIL might be speaking from when drunk. If you can, keep a calm head and suggest he consider therapy.\n\nThere's been plenty of reddit updates/stories that have gone this way. I think one was where the siblings had lots of lap sits, cuddles, kissing, and gaslighting of the spouse to accept it as normal. That poster ended up thinking she was a cover for her fiance/husband and his sister. \n\nYour situation wouldn't be that bad, just BIL being highly inappropriate. Anyways, good luck and limit your contact with him if you can.", "But is seems they have done this a few times and it's no longer a quick speel. Imagine you turn your entire life around and your family can only focus on what you have done wrong in the past.", "So, why do you even have prisons etc.   \nSince you do not believe in debt to society paid and all that?\n\nSo, one tiny misdeed - and you are branded for life?", "Nope yourself. This is a misogynistic mind set, a throw back to treating women as property. There are ways of supporting family you are concerned about without this backwards attitude.", "Watch his criminal past just be a weed thing or some other nonviolent incident. The behavior infantalizes Anna.", "But how often?", "Is he going to break into his wife's home or something?", "Ya I\u2019m gonna go steal all their family heirlooms", "Someone isn\u2019t immediately \u201cthe wrong guy\u201d by virtue of having a criminal conviction. That\u2019s clearly the (misguided) perspective of BIL, though.", "you can invent whatever you want, if that make you happy", "just because you are sure your will not do it doesn't mean that other must believe the same.\n\nyou're only maried for 1 years not 10.", "The highest form of burglary is inheritance, everyone knows this!", "I never said OP was the wrong guy .... I said perhaps his wife has a track record for picking guys who are not wonderful guys so her brother doesn\u2019t trust her judgement. For all we know every guy in her life before OP may have been an asshole & her brother does this big brother speech with every guy. There\u2019s no misguided anything here... Mark wants what is best for his sister. Not challenging to understand. Take the criminal past out of the equation... who cares. That\u2019s information that steers the conversation away from the topic. \n\nThese people don\u2019t like each other, why are they all hanging out??? This 300 word post gives exactly no information about these people & their relationships."]}
