For example, there\u2019s a big difference (in terms of him having any justification being that way) if you were convicted of something violent and/or sexually related vs. non-violent. If it\u2019s the former then I can maybe understand lingering worries he may have. If it\u2019s the latter and nothing that could be related to your treatment of women or potential to be abusive/violent then I think he needs to get over it. You did your time, you\u2019ve turned around your life, and your wife obviously feels you treat her well and doesn\u2019t hold your past against you.\n\nThat being said, even if he has any justification to still be worried about anything, a vacation is not the time or place to be trying to address it.

They have known each other their whole lives. Maybe that\u2019s always been his role to protect his sister. Why are you in a pissing contest with him? You are her husband, he is her brother. If you were truly fed up with the big brother act then maybe you should of had a conversation when you both were sober.

If you\u2019re on the same page, you can both either make sure that you and Mark maintain some distance from now on, or perhaps discuss the ramifications of Mark\u2019s overprotectiveness with him.\n\nPerhaps I am being too optimistic with my ignorance, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely out of the question to settle this conflict in a way that suits everyone - but maybe that\u2019s better done at a time when you haven\u2019t all been drinking. Best wishes!", "Hostility?? Mark made a couple statements because he\u2019s concerned about his sister..... how is that hostile? For all we know Anna may have a long history of choosing the wrong guy so maybe this is just a common routine for brother.", "I am curious , since OP said in their own words this has been something brought up hundreds of times before, how vehemently Mark has touched upon the subject.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bizarre for Mark to be concerned about his sister\u2019s well-being & I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough information in this post to know what kind of relationship all these people have with each other. OP has a criminal history he will have to own those mistakes for the rest of his life. Sucks but it\u2019s just a fact. Unfortunately, based on OP\u2019s info of how he reacted he kind of proved Mark\u2019s point that there\u2019s a reason to be concerned.", "I tend to be a pretty no judgemental person in terms of criminal history as long as its not obviously heinous and scary. \n\nOP unfortunately like you said will have to have that record the rest of his life and he needs to accept that. \n\nMark is a big brother and thats just a fact. Although there needs to be some sort of acceptance reached by him of this relationship. \n\nIt also brings up the point that no one likes to be judged for their worst moments but not everyone has a criminal record or more importantly a lot of people have genuinely never broken a law in their lives. \n\nOP could have left or just not responded too."]}
