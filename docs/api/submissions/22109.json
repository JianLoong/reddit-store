Also, keep in mind that some of these sports camps are for kids who already like the sport and are somewhat competent in it,  if not competitive. If your son is starting from zero and he goes there and underperforms against these kids, he's almost guaranteed to quit.", "My daughter is the same. Will he stick the camp out? And will he enjoy it? If the answer is yes then I\u2019d say you\u2019re being a little harsh as it\u2019s a great way to meet other kids and have fun. \n\nWho cares if it doesn\u2019t stick if he goes to camp and has fun but doesn\u2019t end up in the NBA?\n\nIf you don\u2019t think he\u2019d attend the camp for the entirety based on history then I think you are doing the right thing.", "Is this an overnight camp? Why is it so pricey? I am sure you can find some clinics or day camps in your area that are a fraction of the cost. If you are in the US, start with the local YMCA. \n\nNTA for now", "OP, you are NTA.\r  \n\r  \nYou are right to be hesitant to spend $1700 on a summer camp for your son when he has a history of quitting activities after a few weeks. It's clear that he's not very committed to anything, and you don't want to waste your money on something that he's not going to stick with.\r  \n\r  \nYour wife is probably thinking that your son will fall in love with basketball if he gives it a chance. But that's a risk that you don't have to take. You can offer to get him a hoop for home and see if he's serious about playing basketball. If he is, then you can consider sending him to a camp next summer.\r  \n\r  \nIn the meantime, you can encourage your son to find other activities that he's passionate about. There are plenty of things that he can do for free or at a low cost, such as playing basketball at the park, joining a local sports team, or taking an art class at the library.\r  \n\r  \nThe most important thing is to find something that he enjoys and that he's willing to stick with. If he finds something that he's passionate about, then he'll be more likely to succeed.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s an incredibly large sum of money to waste in the event that he doesn\u2019t end up liking basketball.\n\nMy ex\u2019s son did the same thing. He\u2019d be interested in a sport so we\u2019d deck him out in all of the expensive gear, only for him to decide he didn\u2019t like it. What I\u2019d suggest is buying the hoop or taking him to the park a few times to play to see if he loses interest or not. If he doesn\u2019t lose interest, then suggest the idea of paying for the camp next year if he\u2019d still like to play. That way the option is still on the table in the future :)", "NTA\n\nHonestly I believe there are cheaper ways to figure out if  your son loves the sport. It\u2019s important to support your kid trying different sports/hobbies, but with low investment at first and then invest more money once true interest is \u201cproven\u201d.", "RAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not that he'll end up playing basketball as a career.\n\nIf he has a long history of quitting/dropping out of things early, dad is right to put some stipulations in place.", "Nta", "NTA. But maybe since this is a camp he won't be able to leave and will have to participate?", "NTA but there are probably other non-camp basketball teams he can join in the summer, like at the ymca etc.", "NTA. $1700 summer camp is not the way to initially find out whether you're into something. Especially when it's already mid-July. You'll probably be paying for half the camp. Your suggestions are good. He can try it out at home or school for free first.", "Yta for letting him quit everything.   Rule when I was growing up was you have to at least do a full season of anything you start. I carried that over to my (16m)  some things he did a few years music he hated for 6 full months.   You have taught him to quit things before they have a chance to be fun. \n\nSoccer isn't fun till you get good.   My kid didn't like martial arts until 3 months in.   Then he did it competitively till high-school.   Felt he was more likely to get soccer scholarships and wanted to focus on that.   I ended up coaching robotics for 2 years cause he wanted to try that.   He quit scouts but he made eagle first. \n\nYour kid is just quitting things.  In the beginning when it's hard.   Before the good feelings of hard work kick in. \n\nYou are the asshole.   You aren't supporting him because you let him quit and don't help him achieve goals.", "NTA.  I went through this with my daughter.  Eventually I just stopped enrolling her in stuff & she was ok with it.  I think having him learn at school to see if he really likes it is a good idea.  You didn't tell him no, you told him he has to prove himself first & I find that reasonable.", "Did you know before the deadline? For kids that are pre-teens or teens I think it's fair to set down the rule that you have to complete the season of what you sign up for. Obviously there's exceptions to be made like bullying, sickness, bad coaches, etc. \n\nMost of the time the issues are with communication. There should have been some boundaries set down before pulling the plug, so that's where I see it a tad of yta. Kids need more direction, most kids are told about money but it's not something that they think indepth or clearly about. \n\nKids don't understand the costs of these camps, but that doesn't mean that we cut them off without a conversation.", "This is a huge aspect that's being overlooked. Summer sports camps are typically for wicked dedicated kids, kids dreaming of playing D1 and later pro-ball. He won't perform well compared to them at all, and he also probably won't make many friends because he's gonna be the kid who's bad, which is an ugly duckling situation to say the least. It's not a good plan to send him to this camp. He should join a school team in season and see if he likes it there, less money invested that way and it's more acceptable to be a noobie", "I agree. My parents put me in the YMCA daycamps a lot and it was so much fun and I got to try a lot of things", "OP has clearly tried, and the kid has clearly gone to great lengths to avoid things he find uncomfortable. OP has tried to keep the kid in the activity, but the kid resorts to lying, and when OP takes the kid personally, he doesn't even participate properly. Lastly, the kid clearly doesn't even have any goals nor any intention of actually putting in effort, but just wants to have fun. OP should not have to waste that much money and time. NTA.", "Oh absolutely but just in case I\u2019d read it wrong I just but my thoughts both ways.", "former baller here, that sounds like a pricy sports camp, aka a skills camp, aka 3-a-days, aka living, breathing, drinking basketball for the entire time there\n\nit isn't fun, or, at least, I never had much fun doing them, it's hard fucking work to set yourself up for success in the season to come\n\njust food for thought OP, your intuition is correct, make sure this camp is set up for total noobs because otherwise your kid's basically doomed and might even get bullied (I've seen it happen)", "When I was younger I was similar to your son. I would want to try something and decide it wasn't for me and not want to do it any more. That is part of deciding who you  are. However, because of this, when I wanted to learn to play the Oboe in Middle school my mother wouldn't let me even though the school I had one I could borrow. She forced me to show her I really wanted to be in band by playing her flute first. I hated the flute. Eventually they let me try the oboe but by that point I was so frustrated that I never continued playing the oboe and never learned to play an instrument. Don't do what she did. Let him explore.", "NTA Many parks have basketball hoops. All you need is a ball. If he isn\u2019t interested enough to go out there regularly to play by himself, you are just throwing away money. Also those camps are intended for kids who already play not beginners.", "NTA, and the camp probably isn't going to be fun for him if he's never played a game of basketball in his life.\n\nThe kind of kids who go to camps like that, have already been playing and are usually pretty advanced. He's just going to be picked last so to say.", "NTA.  Most people learned to play and enjoy sports without camps to do so.  If he's really that interested, he would be making an effort to learn the game and basic skills like dribbling,  dribbling while moving, shooting hoops, doing layups, playing with others etc.  You don't need a camp to be learning and doing these things and they are fun to do on your own  and to work on your own skill.\n\nI think offering to buy him a hoop and basketball etc. is a reasonable offer and see if he works on it.", "NTA. Teaching about commitment is of utter importance.", "NTA. Give him a third option: save up and use your own money.", "I think what you could also do is tell him that you will do it but if he quits he gets no allowance until the 1700 is paid back by his allowance money.", "Anybody who is at all \"into\" basketball would be asking for a hoop at home and going to the playground/schoolyard and playing. If he isn't doing these things, it's all BS.", "NTA. I don\u2019t really have a problem with the idea of letting a kid quit something that isn\u2019t working out for them. However if it becomes a trend, I can\u2019t blame you for not wanting to drop a serious amount of money on something where you know it will just be wasted.", "NTA I mean all he needs to get started is a ball.", "I take your point, but if the kid is being an a-hole at the activities, then forcing him to attend is just punishing everyone that actually wants to be there. For example, if OP forces his kid to go to soccer, & if it\u2019s a rec league where everyone gets play time, then every minute that he\u2019s on the field is a minute that some other kid is sitting out & where one kid on the field is intentionally not contributing.", "I thought the same thing. My parents would never let us quit anything we decided to join. We had the same rule as you. It made us very disciplined adults.", "> he also probably won\u2019t make many friends \n\nIf this is a camp for kids that already know how to play basketball, none of these kids are going to want OP on their team / in their drill group / etc. It\u2019s going to be a lot of negativity directed toward him. \n\nI\u2019ve played adult league softball with some people that had never played before & just thought it would be fun. We were all adults that understood that it was important to be kind to others & that there was nothing at stake in our recreational league. But it was still incredibly frustrating to have teammates that didn\u2019t know the basic rules of the sport & couldn\u2019t contribute anything to the success of the team. So I can\u2019t imagine that teens attending an expensive summer sports camp would be particularly kind about it.", "I see nothing to indicate op has done anything other than let him quit things in 3 weeks.   No comment replies or anything just 3 weeks soccer two weeks football.   This kid has no drive and op isn't teaching it to him definitely Ata", "I've actually been on both sides of this. When I was 12, I went to a summer golf camp because it seemed kinda fun, and I wanted to learn. I'd never even held a club before in my life, and I was absolutely fucking garbage at it. I didn't enjoy myself at all, and none of the kids ever wanted to talk to me or be in my group for drills, I hated it. And I've never played golf or been interested in it once since.\n\nWhen I was 17, I went to a swim camp in the summer. I was a pretty good swimmer, top 15-20 range for my event in the state, I swam club outside of my HS team and I swam d3 in college, so middle of the pack for the camp. The kids in the last lane were absolute pariahs, none of us talked to them or gave them pointers or anything. When we went out to eat or to parties after hours, it was a topic of ridicule how slow they were. It's brutal, and it shouldn't be that way, but that's how kids tend to be. \n\nThis kid will almost certainly not enjoy the basketball camp, and it likely will kill any chance he had at liking it later. The middleschool's team is what he should try if he wants to learn it."]}
