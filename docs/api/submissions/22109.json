If he is, then you can consider sending him to a camp next summer.\r  \n\r  \nIn the meantime, you can encourage your son to find other activities that he's passionate about. There are plenty of things that he can do for free or at a low cost, such as playing basketball at the park, joining a local sports team, or taking an art class at the library.\r  \n\r  \nThe most important thing is to find something that he enjoys and that he's willing to stick with.

But maybe since this is a camp he won't be able to leave and will have to participate?", "NTA but there are probably other non-camp basketball teams he can join in the summer, like at the ymca etc.", "NTA. $1700 summer camp is not the way to initially find out whether you're into something. Especially when it's already mid-July. You'll probably be paying for half the camp. Your suggestions are good. He can try it out at home or school for free first.", "Yta for letting him quit everything.   Rule when I was growing up was you have to at least do a full season of anything you start. I carried that over to my (16m)  some things he did a few years music he hated for 6 full months.   You have taught him to quit things before they have a chance to be fun. \n\nSoccer isn't fun till you get good.   My kid didn't like martial arts until 3 months in.   Then he did it competitively till high-school.   Felt he was more likely to get soccer scholarships and wanted to focus on that.   I ended up coaching robotics for 2 years cause he wanted to try that.   He quit scouts but he made eagle first. \n\nYour kid is just quitting things.  In the beginning when it's hard.   Before the good feelings of hard work kick in. \n\nYou are the asshole.   You aren't supporting him because you let him quit and don't help him achieve goals.", "NTA.  I went through this with my daughter.  Eventually I just stopped enrolling her in stuff & she was ok with it.  I think having him learn at school to see if he really likes it is a good idea.  You didn't tell him no, you told him he has to prove himself first & I find that reasonable.", "Did you know before the deadline? For kids that are pre-teens or teens I think it's fair to set down the rule that you have to complete the season of what you sign up for. Obviously there's exceptions to be made like bullying, sickness, bad coaches, etc. \n\nMost of the time the issues are with communication. There should have been some boundaries set down before pulling the plug, so that's where I see it a tad of yta. Kids need more direction, most kids are told about money but it's not something that they think indepth or clearly about. \n\nKids don't understand the costs of these camps, but that doesn't mean that we cut them off without a conversation.", "This is a huge aspect that's being overlooked. Summer sports camps are typically for wicked dedicated kids, kids dreaming of playing D1 and later pro-ball. He won't perform well compared to them at all, and he also probably won't make many friends because he's gonna be the kid who's bad, which is an ugly duckling situation to say the least. It's not a good plan to send him to this camp. He should join a school team in season and see if he likes it there, less money invested that way and it's more acceptable to be a noobie", "I agree. My parents put me in the YMCA daycamps a lot and it was so much fun and I got to try a lot of things", "OP has clearly tried, and the kid has clearly gone to great lengths to avoid things he find uncomfortable. OP has tried to keep the kid in the activity, but the kid resorts to lying, and when OP takes the kid personally, he doesn't even participate properly.

I would want to try something and decide it wasn't for me and not want to do it any more. That is part of deciding who you  are. However, because of this, when I wanted to learn to play the Oboe in Middle school my mother wouldn't let me even though the school I had one I could borrow. She forced me to show her I really wanted to be in band by playing her flute first. I hated the flute. Eventually they let me try the oboe but by that point I was so frustrated that I never continued playing the oboe and never learned to play an instrument. Don't do what she did. Let him explore.", "NTA Many parks have basketball hoops. All you need is a ball. If he isn\u2019t interested enough to go out there regularly to play by himself, you are just throwing away money. Also those camps are intended for kids who already play not beginners.", "NTA, and the camp probably isn't going to be fun for him if he's never played a game of basketball in his life.\n\nThe kind of kids who go to camps like that, have already been playing and are usually pretty advanced. He's just going to be picked last so to say.", "NTA.  Most people learned to play and enjoy sports without camps to do so.  If he's really that interested, he would be making an effort to learn the game and basic skills like dribbling,  dribbling while moving, shooting hoops, doing layups, playing with others etc.  You don't need a camp to be learning and doing these things and they are fun to do on your own  and to work on your own skill.\n\nI think offering to buy him a hoop and basketball etc. is a reasonable offer and see if he works on it.", "NTA. Teaching about commitment is of utter importance.", "NTA.

However if it becomes a trend, I can\u2019t blame you for not wanting to drop a serious amount of money on something where you know it will just be wasted.", "NTA I mean all he needs to get started is a ball.", "I take your point, but if the kid is being an a-hole at the activities, then forcing him to attend is just punishing everyone that actually wants to be there. For example, if OP forces his kid to go to soccer, & if it\u2019s a rec league where everyone gets play time, then every minute that he\u2019s on the field is a minute that some other kid is sitting out & where one kid on the field is intentionally not contributing.", "I thought the same thing. My parents would never let us quit anything we decided to join. We had the same rule as you. It made us very disciplined adults.", "> he also probably won\u2019t make many friends \n\nIf this is a camp for kids that already know how to play basketball, none of these kids are going to want OP on their team / in their drill group / etc. It\u2019s going to be a lot of negativity directed toward him. \n\nI\u2019ve played adult league softball with some people that had never played before & just thought it would be fun. We were all adults that understood that it was important to be kind to others & that there was nothing at stake in our recreational league. But it was still incredibly frustrating to have teammates that didn\u2019t know the basic rules of the sport & couldn\u2019t contribute anything to the success of the team. So I can\u2019t imagine that teens attending an expensive summer sports camp would be particularly kind about it.", "I see nothing to indicate op has done anything other than let him quit things in 3 weeks.   No comment replies or anything just 3 weeks soccer two weeks football.   This kid has no drive and op isn't teaching it to him definitely Ata", "I've actually been on both sides of this. When I was 12, I went to a summer golf camp because it seemed kinda fun, and I wanted to learn. I'd never even held a club before in my life, and I was absolutely fucking garbage at it. I didn't enjoy myself at all, and none of the kids ever wanted to talk to me or be in my group for drills, I hated it. And I've never played golf or been interested in it once since.\n\nWhen I was 17, I went to a swim camp in the summer. I was a pretty good swimmer, top 15-20 range for my event in the state, I swam club outside of my HS team and I swam d3 in college, so middle of the pack for the camp. The kids in the last lane were absolute pariahs, none of us talked to them or gave them pointers or anything. When we went out to eat or to parties after hours, it was a topic of ridicule how slow they were. It's brutal, and it shouldn't be that way, but that's how kids tend to be. \n\nThis kid will almost certainly not enjoy the basketball camp, and it likely will kill any chance he had at liking it later. The middleschool's team is what he should try if he wants to learn it.", "That sort of sleepaway camp is for kids who are *already* good at the sport in question.\n\nIf he goes, he's not going to be happy. I mean, it's going to be way worse than soccer was.\n\nNTA.", "NTA:\nBut maybe ask to sit down to speak to him \u201cman to man\u201d. Tell him he\u2019s getting older and that means more responsibility. So learning about the cost of things and then also commitments when you agree to do something. lay it out for him saying that in the past he would try something and decide it wasn\u2019t for home but xyz money was put out for it and also he instead of being honest would then lie. Those are irresponsible behaviors. So now that he\u2019s older let\u2019s talk about this and look at what this means. Class is this much for this much time. So that equals x number of hours and it\u2019s this much per hour. So you can go to this camp, or you can do xyz and earn that money for these hours and decide to do with it whatever you want after the time period. How do you want to spend your money for the summer? If it\u2019s not a hardship and you can afford it and would do it anyways give your kids their summer allowance and let them decide how they want to spend it. At least make them responsible, but also give them the option and instruction on how to invest it if they want also.", "If this camp is a yearly thing, then tell your son that when school starts back up again, he can join the basketball team. If he likes it and sticks with it for the year, then you'll sign him up for the next summer.", "NTA\n\nThat's a lot of money for something he's never been into before.", "NTAs someone who was a lot like your son (And still is to a certain degree) you are making the right choice, he's gotta learn that things cost and commitment. I still remember how much money I made my dad waste in extracurriculars cause I was always going with fads. The two options you gave him are completely fair and would teach him about committing to something.", "NTA.\n\nHe needs to understand those highlights he watches on YouTube, come from years and years of practice and experience. He says he\u2019s into it, because he\u2019s trying to emulate what he sees on YouTube. Essentially he\u2019s in a phase right now like most teenagers go through. This phase just happens to be him thinking he\u2019s going to be the next LeBron James. \n\nDefinitely don\u2019t sign him up for anything as of right now. Because who knows how long he\u2019s gonna hang on to this basketball thing. He could move on to asking you for something like boxing lessons, since he sees all these YouTube wannabe celebrities boxing. \n\nI do agree with other commenters on this thread. These camps are usually for kids who take the sport incredibly seriously. Kids who dream of playing on a professional level by any means necessary. So if your son is not on the same level as the rest of the kids, the first day / set of drills in. He is more than likely going to get embarrassed due to his low skill level, and the other kids would probably make fun of him for being an extreme amateur. Something to definitely avoid if your kid does not handle humiliation /embarrassment well. Being m made fun of by random kids he\u2019s never met before will definitely screw with him. \n\nBut I do think these are phases in his life. If he was truly serious about it, he\u2019d be doing a lot more to work on it than watching highlight moment compilations on YouTube.", "NTA", "You are doing parenting right and your wife is spoiling him wrong.\n\nYou actually need to sit her down and have a talk with her.\n\nNTA\n\nActions should have consequences, and if things keep going as they are, you are just teaching him that it's ok to give up withou effort. \n\nThat is going to screw him up royally in adult life. Teach him now that if he starts something, he must be responsible for it.\n\nLet me suggest you this. Tell him that if he wants to go, he'll have to help pay for hte costs. Make him do some sort of labor, like mowing grass, doing dishes, walking the neighboors dogs, make him babysit, etc. and \"pay him\" for it. Sit down with him and explain how much it costs to go to camp and you're willing to help him pay for part of it, but the rest is up to him and his effort.\n\nLet him EARN IT.\n\nThis will help him become more responsible and value effort more.", "NTA majority of these camps are for children already playing at a certain level looking to improve their skills", "NTA...

Earn his own money for it is my suggestion. Haven't you gone into enough time, money, and effort in trying to find his passion? That's above and beyond; just because you can afford it doesn't mean you should waste anymore on temporary fads.", "If he's not into basketball, NTA. That's a lot of money to spend if he's just interested in the viral clips", "This OP!!\n\nLet this be a great opportunity to teach adult skills!", "See that's where I disagree at 6-8 years when op should have started the kids need breaks anyway.   It won't hurt a high performing kid to sit out a bit.   At 8-11 even in rec league the high performing kids need to be learning how to motivate the less motivate.   It still won't hurt them to log a few less minutes. \n\nStarting at 5th grade most kids have the option to do rec or a competitive team.  Not all the kids make the competitive team.   Some kids on the 5th-6th grade soccer play both cause they don't get a lot of play time when 8th graders are on the team.   \n\nThe competitive kids that make both teams should be getting their play time.   Kid that isn't interested at this point there is no problem benching him and just making him show up as a punishment.   The competitive kids should definitely at this point be mentoring struggling kids.   They should also be helping the kids in the middle of ability so they make the 8th grade team next year. \n\nOp's kid is 13 at this point.  If he's on a school team coach doesn't care to bench him.   I watched my kid ride bench all basketball season.   He logged maybe 10 minutes of play time.   Coach said he trys, he's a natural athlete.   He's also 5'8 and sucks at basketball.   He hung out the season but will not repeat.  This is a kid that was all conference in soccer at 15 and made the state team for his age.   It taught him a valuable lesson sticking the season out and nobody lost playtime. \n\nIt's possible ops kid would just sit there miserable the whole time.   It's also possible he'll try.
