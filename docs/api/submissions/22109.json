Also, keep in mind that some of these sports camps are for kids who already like the sport and are somewhat competent in it,  if not competitive. If your son is starting from zero and he goes there and underperforms against these kids, he's almost guaranteed to quit.", "My daughter is the same. Will he stick the camp out? And will he enjoy it? If the answer is yes then I\u2019d say you\u2019re being a little harsh as it\u2019s a great way to meet other kids and have fun. \n\nWho cares if it doesn\u2019t stick if he goes to camp and has fun but doesn\u2019t end up in the NBA?\n\nIf you don\u2019t think he\u2019d attend the camp for the entirety based on history then I think you are doing the right thing.", "Is this an overnight camp? Why is it so pricey? I am sure you can find some clinics or day camps in your area that are a fraction of the cost. If you are in the US, start with the local YMCA. \n\nNTA for now", "OP, you are NTA.\r  \n\r  \nYou are right to be hesitant to spend $1700 on a summer camp for your son when he has a history of quitting activities after a few weeks. It's clear that he's not very committed to anything, and you don't want to waste your money on something that he's not going to stick with.\r  \n\r  \nYour wife is probably thinking that your son will fall in love with basketball if he gives it a chance. But that's a risk that you don't have to take. You can offer to get him a hoop for home and see if he's serious about playing basketball. If he is, then you can consider sending him to a camp next summer.\r  \n\r  \nIn the meantime, you can encourage your son to find other activities that he's passionate about. There are plenty of things that he can do for free or at a low cost, such as playing basketball at the park, joining a local sports team, or taking an art class at the library.\r  \n\r  \nThe most important thing is to find something that he enjoys and that he's willing to stick with. If he finds something that he's passionate about, then he'll be more likely to succeed.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s an incredibly large sum of money to waste in the event that he doesn\u2019t end up liking basketball.\n\nMy ex\u2019s son did the same thing. He\u2019d be interested in a sport so we\u2019d deck him out in all of the expensive gear, only for him to decide he didn\u2019t like it. What I\u2019d suggest is buying the hoop or taking him to the park a few times to play to see if he loses interest or not. If he doesn\u2019t lose interest, then suggest the idea of paying for the camp next year if he\u2019d still like to play. That way the option is still on the table in the future :)", "NTA\n\nHonestly I believe there are cheaper ways to figure out if  your son loves the sport. It\u2019s important to support your kid trying different sports/hobbies, but with low investment at first and then invest more money once true interest is \u201cproven\u201d.", "RAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
