This is because people really do put up on a pedestal these types of people. Look anywhere on the internet. People who harass and bully and commit crimes and steal from stores and throw chairs across restaurants that people and everything else get praised and get online followers and have GoFundMe account sent towards them etc. People doing good honest things or helping others get laughed at and caught a tool\n\nWelcome to the Real world.
