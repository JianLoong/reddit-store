But either way you would have chosen grace and adult/mature communication. That can't be bad.", "Meh I feel like if you asked this chick that question she would just say \"cuz your forehead is big\" and continue her Chapelle laugh, whatever that is, lol.", "Standing up for yourself doesn\u2019t mean insulting others. It means you set a boundary and stick with it. The entire group needs to let her know her behavior is unacceptable.", "Thank you. I cannot believe that kid just wrote that lol. I know people who lost everything in their fucking life that doesn't even begin to insult or take their stress out on others like A. Jfc. Talk about toxic and abusive.", "This is the best advice. Tell the sweet friend and let her decide if she wants to hang with you guys without her! People advising cutting the sweet friend out without saying shit about what\u2019s going on are not thinking compassionately.", "It\u2019s not great to accept this behaviour and not call it out. I would say though it\u2019s not always selfishness, I\u2019ve had situations like this and the friend who said nothing was super passive because they had been emotionally  and physically abused their whole life by their parent. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always so black and white, some people have only ever known shit behaviour and it feels familiar.", "Found \u201cA\u201d \ud83d\ude14\ud83e\udef5", "You smell like poo and wee", "I bet this sounded really cool in your head. Would be awkward asf irl", "And the entire group needs to let A know that her behavior is unacceptable, including her best friend. Have you forgotten that A has done that multiple times? Bring up and make fun of her \"friends\" weights? Now that it's being directed back at her, it's suddenly not okay? You can't be surprised and play the victim when you get the energy you give out.", "It's not easy to do this when someone takes your confidence down a level, especially at what sounds like a casual group date. A knows what she was doing. This isn't the first time, and when brought up before she calls it joking.", "Projection is way too real", "I don\u2019t disagree at all. Altho the same could be said for A, she\u2019s probably cruel and belittling because of her own trauma. Why apply accountability to one and not the other? There\u2019s a point at which grown ups have to own, and be held responsible, for their own actions or inactions and bestie requires this as much as A does. \n\nOP is feeling unable to be rid of A at the risk of losing sweet bestie. My point is to mainly help take a second look at bestie from a fresh perspective to help clarify that she\u2019s at least in part *actively* responsible for the harm caused by A by continually bringing her when she is not invited, and defending her actions by being angry when there is legitimate and proportionate reprisal.", "Yeah that's like some high school sitcom TV shit lmao.", "I agree that it\u2019s possible she is just a bit selfish, you originally wrote your comment with a lot of assurance and it removed the nuance. I just think if everybody listened to people on reddit, no one would actually have any friends lol. Most of the advice on AITA is to cut someone out, divorce, break up. Fair enough to suggest that if they\u2019re inflicting harm, but otherwise I think it\u2019s applying moral absolutism to something that\u2019s actually more complicated.", "She\u2019s not \u201costracizing\u201d anyone. If you act shitty people don\u2019t want to be around you. That\u2019s not bullying that\u2019s consequences.", "And A has NO right to keep degrading everyone to make herself feel better at the expense of other people. She didn't tell her not to bring her friend directly. She just only privately messaged her. That is not bullying that is excluding. What A is doing is the textbook definition of bullying. Can you really blame her? Why would people want her around if she's going to constantly spew insults towards them?", "Um, if someone is rude and degrading to you, how on earth would trying to avoid that person make you a bully?\n\nAlso\u2026 I wonder why that girl has only one friend\u2026 what a mystery.", "Nobody is saying the bestie can\u2019t hang out with A.  She just can\u2019t bring her to the group events because A can\u2019t behave herself.  That is not bullying, that is laying a boundary.", ">OP has NO right telling the other girl to \"not bring\" her friend.\n\nSay what now? Since when does anyone have the right to force someone to associate/socialise with another person?\n\n>She's trying to ostracise the girl from her (potentially) only friend.\n\nNo she isn't. The friend is welcome to hang out with 'A' whenever she wants, where OP is also not present.", "Wow\u2026 you don\u2019t have many friends, do you? If you act like that, no one would waste time on you.", "Imagine being that deranged.", "Yeah brevity definitely affects nuance! Sometimes I use that to try to jolt a new perspective, but the downside is certainly that it looks too black and white. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t particularly want people like bestie to necessarily get ditched, rather that they be seen in their totality, ie as responsible for their behaviours and impacts, and not just through the lens of their mmm presentation? People can often present as sweet and kind while also doing harm through their passivity / inactions etc. and not get seen for it because of the power of their presentation. So you get two kinds of toxicity, the overt, like A, and the permissive, like bestie. But A is more noisy and thus gets observed more easily. I think it\u2019s important to level that playing field. But in general I do feel it should be done with empathy too.", "I'm guessing you're talking about yourself there?  Because it's weird you would spring to that assumption \ud83d\ude06", "Exactly its like being respectful and trying to understand  the biggest bully of yours for what??for bullying u.", "Same \nOP did the right thing", "Yeah I can understand that, I honestly think the nuance is a bit more persuasive for me personally. I tend to follow advice when it feels compassionate. Have you ever vented to a friend about someone they didn\u2019t know, and they go full mumma bear? They want you to ditch them, they think they\u2019re horrible etc. It\u2019s sweet that they care, but it feels like they don\u2019t understand. \n\nBut yeah I agree that complacency is complicity at times."]}
