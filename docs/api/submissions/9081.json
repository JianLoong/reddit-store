I didn't really have anything I wanted, but my mom always complains about how crappy my favorite pair of boots looks (they're a pair of Docs I bought secondhand over a decade ago, they're pretty torn up) so I figured I'd ask for a new pair of nice boots. I sat down with my mom and we looked at boots on their site and found a pair we both liked. Christmas comes around and my parents admit that they haven't gotten them yet because they wanted to pick them up from the store instead of paying for shipping which I was fine with, and they both said they would get them for me soon.\n\nMy parents and I talked on the phone multiple times over the next month, and every time we would talk they would mention the boots, and say they were going to get them soon. Two weeks ago (Jan 18th) my girlfriend tells me that her best friend's boyfriend is going to propose to her, and my girlfriend wants to have a party at her apartment where it will happen. Her best friend's birthday is Feb 7th, so the party is going to be the weekend before. She wants it to be absolutely perfect, and so we started planning, including outfits. My outfit included the boots that my parents said they were going to get.\n\nThat Sunday night (22nd) I sent my parents a text letting them know that I need the boots by the first weekend of Feb. I had phone calls with each of them last week where they both confirmed getting the text, confirm understanding the time limit, and they both say that they were getting the boots that week. I visit them Sunday and they haven't gotten the boots. I tell them I would prefer that they get them early in the week as I'm going to be running errands to help my girlfriend prep for the party as the weekend approaches.\n\nI text my parents Mon m to remind them. They say that they forgot but promise they'll get them Tues so I can come pick them up on time. Same thing Tues. I remind them Wed morning, and ask my dad about them when he calls me about something else and he yells at me because I only wanted to talk about the boots.\n\nThursday I buy the boots myself. I pick them up on the way home from work, and text my parents afterwards telling them they don't need to get me the boots because I got them myself.\n\nMy dad calls me an hour later yelling about how they said they were going to get the boots and I went out and got them instead and how I had made my mom cry by buying them myself. My mom never responded to the message I sent her after that call. This morning my sisters both text me saying that I had made mom cry the night before, and my aunt called me in the early afternoon asking what I had done to make my mom cry. Potentially unrelated but I was planning on going to a show with my cousin and she hasn't been responding to my messages today (she's 20 and in college so I understand a lack of responses on a normal Friday).", "created_utc": 1675475439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10t1ufw/aita_for_buying_some_boots_my_parents_said_they/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seems like you're expected to be psychic and figure out what's going on without ever being told. Can they maybe not afford the boots? It's weird. But honestly you have them every chance and were very clear in your messages. Can you figure it out your Aunt was told some story about what happened that's different from what you know happened? People do that a lot: paint themselves in a good light in their stories when they want sympathy.  NTA", "NTA. They offered to buy you boots.  They said they\u2019d buy the boots. They had multiple opportunities to buy the boots. You needed the boots. So you bought them yourself. So weird that a Christmas present took this long!", "NTA. What\u2019s the point of asking what you want for Christmas if they don\u2019t get you the gift for Christmas????? It\u2019s almost Valentine\u2019s Day. Christmas decorations have long since been taken down. Christmas is not on anyone\u2019s mind anymore. They\u2019ve had over two months to get these for you and they just kept coming up with excuses. Sounds a little manipulative to me, honestly. They could still buy you a pair, though! Nothing wrong with two pairs of Doc\u2019s!", "Nta. You didn't \"make\" your mom cry. She (and your dad) created a situation where she felt guilty about not getting you something you asked for.", "NTA\n\nSounds like mom was crying because *she* realized that *she* did not get her child a Christmas gift, and that *she* spoiled whatever little bonding thing she thinks happened when you picked them out together, because *she* prioritized everything else for a month and a half *after* the holiday was over\n\nShe's likely regretting dozens of opportunities where she put it off for whatever reason. And probably feels like people are judging her and thinking she's a bad mom for not getting your gift.\n\nThat's really sad, because we all get wrapped up and miss a holiday goal at *some* time in life, and the fact that it's sad is probably why the rest of your family is yapping.\n\nBut it's not your fault. You did nothing wrong. You needed the boots by a certain date, and you bought yourself the boots when they didn't appear in time. Not your fault. \n\nI might have gone with a no AHs, but your dad is kinda over the top. So... yeah nta", "NTA.  As an aside, who charges for shipping these days when you order boots online?", "NTA. It's been over a month. At some point you don't have to keep waiting. If your mom is crying, it's because she feels bad for not following through, not because of anything you did.", " NTA.  I hate this kind of \u201cgift\u201d giving, where they are attached to the idea of giving this gift, but then it monopolizes actually procuring the gift without some guilt trip.", "NTA. They chose not to get the boots and now are angry for not doing the bare minimum. Apparently, you need to wait forever and have them dangle the boots? \n\nThe fact everyone ganged up on you feels like manipulation. Consider not playing the game. Don't call, don't text, don't apologize. Let them come to you and answer accordingly. And if your sisters and other relatives try to come after you, tell them you are not having this conversation and get off the phone. \n\nGo to the show alone.", "NTA tell them to Venmo you the money and \ud83d\udca5they bought your boots. Problem solved, no crying necessary, no need for drama and you look fabulous for your event. OMG is that too adult? JK you are not the AH they procrastinated and you needed them so you bought them it\u2019s not like you sold a kidney or bought on black market.", "Nta. It's the 4th of Feb here in Aus. Christmas is well and truly over. \n\nTell your family they had multiple opportunities to get said boots, but they have continuously put it off. If there was a reason, it hasn't been explained, but you also would have understood said reason IF you were told.", "NTA.  They didn't have time to get you the boots, but they certainly had plenty of time to broadcast that you \"made mom cry.\"  Honestly, it is just very strange and thoughtless behavior on their part, especially rallying other relatives to chastise you even though they are at fault.", "NTA they were never getting you those boots.  You needed them, they didn't bother to get them, so you did.  Your mom cried over that to the point other family members were calling you?  Geez.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It wasn\u2019t that important to them so you stepped in and took care of yourself. If they truly wanted to get those boots for you and money was not an issue (as stated in a comment by OP) then they would\u2019ve already been in your hands. Empty promises are not your responsibility to wait on.", "NTA. But maybe a solution that assuages your mother\u2019s guilt is for them to pay you back for the boots. she\u2019s sad at her procrastination, not at you- even if she doesn\u2019t realize it.", "Your parents need to grow up. NTA", "NTA. It seems that you were always going to have to get those boots yourself. \n\nThey promised more than once to get them and didn't follow through so you didn't have a choice because you needed them.\n\nChristmas is LONG over by now, and if there was a reason they couldn't get the boots they needed to communicate that instead of constantly delaying. \n\nIf she's crying now because you had to buy them yourself it's her own fault.", "I don't think cost is an obstacle for them. My parents are always busy so I'm afraid I upset them by accidentally implying something about that by buying the boots. I don't know what my aunt was told but I know she wasn't sold on my perspective.", "I did say on one of the other comments my family is very loose about when Christmas presents come through because I was extremely broke in college and shortly after, so I got presents when I could afford them and that has spread to the rest of my family in the years since. For example my uncle got Pokemon Legends Arceus for his grandkids last year because that was what they were most excited about. It was still a Christmas present even though it came out at the end of January.", "This is very insightful and I hope OP it to heart.", "So Dr Martens doesn't charge shipping BUT there was a discount for pickup which is basically the same thing. I've been referring to it as shipping costs because of that.", "Cost was my first thought as well. Particularly because they didn't want to pay shipping, and for some reason didn't go shopping before Christmas? Were they waiting for an after Christmas sale? \n\nBut NTA. You actually need the boots, so you got the boots. What more is there to it?", "You didn't imply anything. They feel angry because they know they screwed up. But I have to ask: have they done this before?", "Well then they are lazy. You mom was embarrassed and didn\u2019t like feeling that way so blamed you.", "My question is....did they get you anything (else) for Christmas? Or did you just get the promise of boots?", "Makes sense. I didn\u2019t want to assume it was a money thing, but I totally get that. Still, two pairs of Docs is great!", "They've had almost 2 months, you told them multiple times you needed the boots by a specific date - you did everything you could.\n\nThe rest of your family is being very judgemental. Tell them they should walk a mile in your shoes - they couldn't have before, because you didn't have them.", "They also have a like 10-15% discount for students through unidays! I paired that with a sale and a 12% cashback perk on one of my credit cards. I also bought Docs for myself as a Christmas gift and stacking rewards helped lessen the blow.", "It being late isn't an issue for me. I used to do all of my Christmas shopping in the first week of January when I was broke straight out of college, so my family has gotten pretty loose about Christmas presents being there on Christmas. My dad and I used to joke that we were secretly Eastern Orthodox because most of our presents were given in January.", "They haven't. I'll admit that I assumed it was likely I was in the wrong and I was making this post mostly in the hopes that impartial eyes would see where I went wrong. My parents are generally very reasonable and the only other time I can think of something remotely like this happening is years ago they got pissed at me because I bought tickets for a concert the day they had gone on sale, which was like 2 days before my birthday. I hadn't mentioned that until a week or so before the actual concert date, so my parents were mad they hadn't even had the opportunity to consider getting them for me because I had never told them. Ever since then I've always mentioned ticket sales that go up around my birthday and they let me know if they're considering buying them or not.", "They did! My parents got my sisters and I matching sweaters and a pair of books for each of us but they got each of us one bigger thing as well. My sisters got a new guitar and a digital camera, and I was getting the boots.", "I'm a decade too old for the student discount but I'll definitely pass that on to my cousin lol. They're definitely worth it though because my old Docs are at least 15 years old and they're still working! They're scuffed to hell and back and have a couple tears in the leather but they're still extremely comfortable and no holes yet. I bought them second hand for like $50 so basically I paid $5/year for great boots.", "hi what card has 12% cashback lol", "Its weird that they have a pattern of making presents FOR YOU about them as gifters. The end result is not really focused on making you happy.", "The silver capital one card has varying amounts for different stores. The base is 1.5%, but I get like 6% at Chewy, 4% at Petco, etc. Certain stores are constant but others rotate out like doordash. I've not checked Docs since about Nov when I bought mine, but I did a happy lil goblin dance as soon as I saw how much I'd be able to save!", "Haha sweet", "Nta you communicated that you had a timeline for the boots multiple times which they missed. Also if I were your parents and forgot to buy you the boots I would have apologized for being busy and offered to pay for them still. Does it matter who picks them up from the store? Their reaction seems very bizarre like there is something else going on", "NTA. Your Mom is likely crying because somewhere deep down she knows she fucked up. Either these boots were not in their budget and they didn't want to tell you, or they simply didn't care enough. All round, it's a weird way to behave towards your kids, even weirder that the whole family is coming for you. Maybe try this: \"Hey Mom, do you think I didn't cry on Christmas when I received nothing from my parents because they wanted to save a few dollars on shipping?\"", "NTA their procrastination is the reason for your mothers tears. I\u2019d suggest that moving forward you ask your folks for things that are cheap and unimportant. Also a perfect solution to this issue would be to save the receipt and have them reimburse you for them if they\u2019d like!", "Nta. Maybe they meant next Christmas lol?", "This is worse than the books one. What a lot of drama over nothing. How many times do they have to fail to deliver on their promise before you're allowed to give up and get the thing yourself? NTA and ffs, if they care that much they can give you the money.", "Why can\u2019t your parents just reimburse you for the boots? Or why couldn\u2019t they place an online order for pick up & then have you pick them up?", "NTA. As a chronic \"I need to do X\" type person, I understand the shame and guilt your mom is probably feeling right now. But at the same time if I say \"Hey, I'm gonna get you something for Christmas,\" and Christmas, New Year's, and MLK Day come and go, Punxatawny Phil sees his shadow, and I still haven't bought that gift? That's a fuckup entirely of my own making. You told them you needed them by a certain time and you waited as long as you reasonably could before it was too late.", "NTA. They strung you along for 2 months with no follow through and minimal communication. You had a deadline, and nothing suggested they were going to meet it. Your mom crying to everyone is insanely manipulative. Start sending everyone the call logs and text screenshots so they can see for themselves what you were dealing with.", "NTA"]}
