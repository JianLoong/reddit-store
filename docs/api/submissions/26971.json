She has had 2 children living with her during that time, my sister E (f19) and Iris (f16) who are from her previous marriage. She shares custody of them with her ex husband. I am (30)f if it matters. \n\n Iris has recently turned 16 and got a job and her license. My mother had previously said that she would be able to date once she was 16. So at a dinner I casually asked \u201cso when is she going to be allowed to date now.\u201d \n\nMy mothers BF immediately chimed in over my mom and said \u201cnot until she is 18 and out of the house\u201d to which I responded \u201csorry who are you?\u201d And he asked \u201cwho do you think I am.\u201d I replied \u201cmy mother\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d \n\nHe took offense to this claiming that he helped \u201craise\u201d my little sisters. I personally don\u2019t think that anyone but the children\u2019s parents should have a say, or think they have a say like that in how a child is raised. He also reacted the same way with my older sister E about her dating. She was never allowed to date while she was younger, and my mother told us all to hide it from him that she had gotten a boyfriend when she first moved to college as he would get angry. E has been dating that same boy for over a year now and he is a sweet heart and will do the world for her. My mothers BF won\u2019t let him set foot in the house because of how strongly he feels about it. \n\nAnyways the BF got his feelings hurt and basically said \u201cI see how you see me\u201d and left from the dinner and my mother is pissed at me but all of my sisters agree with me (including my 2 older sisters and can\u2019t believe he had the audacity to butt into the conversation and think he has a say in the matter. My mother says I shouldn\u2019t be saying anything about her relationship. I think she has issues separating her relationship from her children and that her and his relationship\nDoes not and should not include her previous children. I would also have a the same stance if they were married.\n\n\nSome more background: The children\u2019s father is still very much in the picture, although he is also very much an asshole. My mother\u2019s BF has helped to buy Iris a car recently. He has also kicked the older of the 2 girls E out 2 times from \u201chis house.\u201d I told E about this whole ordeal and she laughed at the thought that he \u201craised\u201d them and she said that her and Iris will have a lot of trauma to work through with a therapist in years to come from him. To her he was simply around, her and Iris are incredibly close and I\u2019m sure share the sentiment. \n\nEdit for more background: \nHe does minimal things in the house for them. This is not a case where he is checking their grades, helping with their homework, buying them school clothes, taking them to and from school and friends houses. My mom does all that. He lives with them and talks to them everyday. But he isn\u2019t really providing for them other then that they live in his house, and he does take them on vacations, buy them presents, treat them to dinner out sometimes, etc\u2026\n\nEdit 2: They split rent for 10 years with my mom paying more money because of her kids. The kids are half with my mom half with their biological dad. In the last two years the boyfriend bought a house that now they live in.\n\nAnyways am I the asshole for thinking and saying that he shouldn\u2019t get a say in when and if my sisters are allowed to date?", "created_utc": 1694845722, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16k07zr/aita_for_saying_my_moms_bf_should_not_have_a_say/", "score": 254, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However I am more bothered that at 18 she is supposed to be \"out of the house\". Wtf?", "I\u2019m going with NTA because I suspect that BF is very controlling of the women and girls in his life and does not allow OP\u2019s mother to make her own parenting decisions (and likely more). This is from him not letting OP\u2019s mother answer the question, that OP\u2019s older sister had to hide that she was dating and can\u2019t bring her BF into the house even though she\u2019s an adult, and the sisters\u2019 mention of trauma.", "NTA. This should be up to your mother and possibly bio dad. It\u2019s not like moms boyfriend raised E from birth and since they aren\u2019t married he technically isn\u2019t even her step-father. My daughter is 16 and if I were in your mothers shoes my boyfriend would have very little say in what my daughter can/cannot do. I hope E and Iris grow into happy, healthy adults. And I think everyone could use therapy!", "NTA he sounds like a controlling, unpleasant man. I don\u2019t think raised your sister so much as traumatized her and all of you and he barely contributes to household. What a waste of space. He has no business acting like he\u2019s word is law, what a joke\n\nI\u2019m hoping you have a plan for that AH inevitably kicks out your sister", "NTA good for you for standing up to him something your mother clearly needs to learn to do", "NTA. He doesn't get to decide.", "NTA. And having to hide things from your mom's boyfriend because he won't react well to it, is a red flag. Is he always so controlling?", "My first thought was E S H because dude has been there for a while and supported them financially so he should have some say but NTA because he sounds controlling and old fashioned.", "INFO: your sister E\u2019s BF isn\u2019t allowed in the house, but left the table during this dinner with mom\u2019s BF?", "NTA. He's the bf. Your sisters have two active parents who can make any decisions on dating.", "NTA and I think banning teens from dating is often a bad idea in general. As with your older sister, teens that want to date will probably try regardless of the ban. except they won't feel like they're able to talk to their parents for help or advice if they have issues or concerns in a relationship.", "NTA. You told him the truth. He needed to hear it. Too bad your Mom thinks his precious feelings are more important than her children.", "NTA.", "You are TA for stirring things up in a way that is likely to get taken out on your sisters. You can say what you want and leave; they have to live with him and have already said that he's harmful to them. There are ways to address it with your mom that aren't as problematic. ESH", "ESH. There clearly is more going on here then meets the eye. You come off disrespectful and patronizing. If this man was only \"just there\" and did not lift a finger to help with any parenting duties throughout the entire 12 years it seems pretty unlikely that he would start now out of the blue. I believe he was always a part of making decisions while you were all growing up and where this bad blood has originally come from. You believed he never had a right and he and your mother believed otherwise.", "Perhaps I see things differently...the 'BF' is a symptom of the problem IMO, the real problem is your mother allowing the BF defacto 'parental' authority over kids that aren't his, a controlling/domineering personality (this 'my house' BS), and finally...just the sheer inappropriateness of preventing a young woman from dating.  16 years of age is, IMO, an appropriate age for a young woman to start dating.  Again personally...I believe young people should begin dating from the relatively safe confines of the family dwelling.  I went to a small Christian mid-west college, which was fine, but saw many 'sheltered' young girls be 'free' for the first time at campus.  And frankly...some explored those 'freedoms' to fervently.\n\nYes...step-day over-stepped IMO and is too much of a control freak but Mom appears all too willing to capitulate.  THAT said...you could have interjected in a more diplomatic way.  The tone and harshness of your language may only have served to harden his stance.  In the end...you need to find out what your Mother's beliefs are, embolden her to be more forceful, or another tact...allow little sister to move in with you.", "I will go with YTA. You are obviously not in the household and are stirring shit. While I agree that you should be there for your sisters, you are just causing trouble by discounting his role in the household. The correct approach would be to disagree than to ask who are you ? And stepfather is controlling but the real father is not even around in their day to day lives. Practice some grace and gratitude, if he is not a lousy stepfather otherwise. There are worse real dads out there.", "NAH.\n\nIf mom's BF wanted to be a father, he'd put a ring on it.  He hasn't.  That means either (a) he doesn't want to be the father, or (b) mom doesn't want him to be the father.  In neither case should his opinion count.", "EHS. No one (your mom included) has any right to dictate when anyone can start dating. They do have the right to say who they are allowed in their house, obviously, but not who gets to date.\n\nHowever, you don't seem to respect his role in the home. He has been there for 12 years. Biodad might still be in the picture, but shared custody= shared raising and responsibility. He's been there since they were children. He most definitely has a say in things. We don't know the reasons why they haven't gotten married and frankly that's not even relevant considering people are perfectly capable of having very, very long term relationships without being married (maybe your mom doesn't want to get married, either way she's content with their relationship status if she's still there).", "Withholding judgement.  Dude's been around 12 years, sounds like he has contributed financially to raising the kids in his home.  Crazy how easily people can dismiss the BF before considering the potential depth of his involvement. \n\nHe may not have a say, but he definitely has ever right to pull his support from children that are not his own, living under his roof, that don't want to obey the rules of his household.", "NTA. He probably deserved a little more respect than what you gave him though.", "Yta his raised for sister for **12** years he is as much a parent as your mother \n\nDo better be less of an asshole", "ESH.

My mom had said she would get to date when she was 16 and had a car. She does now so I was asking about it, it wasn\u2019t me demanding her to let her date.", "He *can* set the rules, but if the rule is controlling or unreasonable, he's the AH for setting it. To say that OP is an AH for trying to defend her sister from his AH behaviour is ridiculous. \n\nShe's not \"trying to decide who has a say\", she's trying to protect her sister from a specific overreach. Insinuating that she's also trying to control the situation to try to reduce her to the same.level as BF is pure sophistry.", "Their biological dad is around. They split time. He came into money in the last 2 years which my mom\nHelped out with. She helped him reach a settlement and instead of taking a percentage of it for her work on it instead has opted for him to take them on trips and get her daughter a car. So sure technically he has helped out. But he never did before and has been known as a general tight ass to the point where he told my mom once that she should pay all the gas bills and he shouldn\u2019t pay any (they were splitting rent at the time in an apartment) because she cooks and he doesn\u2019t. Even though she cooks for him and does all the grocery shopping. So no I don\u2019t think these past 2 years account for much", "So? This doesn't mean he can just overrule their bio parents. op wrote in the first edit that their father is still in their lives, so their mom's boyfriend doesn't have a say on Iris' life", "\"Shall I encourage them to explore these new emotions in a safe environment I can monitor and step in if required?\n\nNo I shall completely forbid it and kick them out the house when they turn 18 so they have to figure it all out by themselves with the additional stress of being housing insecure\"\n\nIt's like a scientific method to ensure your kids end up in abusive relationships.", "Completely agree with you there!", "Say who does and doesn\u2019t get to have a say is having a say in how a kid should be raised. If you think only the parents should have a say, then you should shut your mouth.", "Except the step dad is also a provider for the family and is pulling his fair share of parenting duties as well.", "Just because someone is right, doesn't mean they're not an asshole.\n\nThis person spat in the face of the guy that had been taking care of them and their mother for 12 years. He stepped up. Saying \"Who are you?\" to the guy who took care of them for 12 years is a 110% asshole move.", "So? That is actually quite fair.", "What parenting duties? My mom does everything.", "I think you maybe underplaying your stepfather\u2019s contribution."]}
