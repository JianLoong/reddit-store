I\u2019d offer to rotate on places though.  That way every now and then you go where he wants.  But he needs to understand y\u2019all want to go other places too", "NTA, I feel like a good rule of thumb for this kind of situation (religious and/or food allergy restrictions) is to rotate who gets to pick the location with the guardrails that the location must have at least one of each course that the person with restrictions can eat. IE, if they are Muslim there has to be a salad, appetizer, entree, and desert that fulfill all the restrictions against pork and meat being halal. If that\u2019s a vegetarian option that counts. If he chooses to come, wonderful! If he tries to insist you go to a place he wants to go, sorry- it\u2019s Steve\u2019s turn to choose and he wants sushi. \n\nAlso an important note- his religion is HIS choice, not one he gets to impose upon the entire table. You have every right to get a pork dish and eat it next to him. Or have an alcoholic beverage in his presence\u2026. or even be in a place that has the ability to serve it, good lord that\u2019s so extra of him. \n\nI think don\u2019t exclude him, always offer and make sure he sees he has an OPTION to fulfill his requirements.

You each accommodate one another. It's not about forcing people to go in a specific direction all the time. Sometimes you go out to eat with him, and sometimes you don't. And sometimes... He can try some f**king sushi.\n\nYour friend should know better. \n\nI think instead of outright excluding him though, you should just present it along the lines of: Hey, fancy going Tennis next week? A few of us want to try this restaurant after. \n\nThen if he says no, or tries to get you to change your mind? Just say: That's cool, we can try that place next time, as I think everyone already wants to go to a specific place.", "NTA.

Like hey if you\u2019re just going to complain the whole time you don\u2019t have to come, and it\u2019s a group thing we can\u2019t always just cater to one person. \n\nBut also if it\u2019s always been a group thing, why did it take him a month to realize you guys were going without him?

It was a once a month thing.  When it was your turn, you got to pick.  One month I picked a Wing House.  One dude, was like no way, that place is crap, when I picked it was steak, when so and so picked we had seafood, etc.  Finally I told him, hey it's my pick,  I'm feeling casual, and IF you can't make it, I understand.  He showed up and of course ordered a grilled fish sandwich, claimed it 'sucked'.  All 5 of us chimed in, \"try the wings\" they're terrific.  Place had 20 large screen tv's and was that time of year when baseball and football was in full swing.  5 of us had a blast.  The next month one of the others chose the same place.

Also Muslim, and would never act this way. Guy sounds like a hand full. Also, regarding the sushi.. assuming you guys are in US, there are Japanese restaurants here that do have sushi rolls with cooked fish. Maybe your friend should try that instead.

I live in a town with a big Muslim population, meaning we have some epic restaurants from all over the world and that the other local restaurants are used to the question 'what's suitable for a halal diet?' If you live in a similar demographic, they'll likely know what to point out to him on the menu. The gluten free thing may take some working around but again, not exactly one in a million. He's just being awkward.", "NTA. _He_ can\u2019t eat pork or other non-halal meat, or gluten.

He would just have to check the menu to see what he could eat.\n\nAs others have said, maybe invite him once the location is decided and _sometimes_ go with his pick.", "I'm going with YTA. Sounds like you're excluding him from the group because of his dietary restrictions.

That means cutting through the jugular vein, carotid artery, and windpipe in order to drain all blood from the carcass. In Islam, the consumption of blood is considered haram.\"\n\nUnless the restaurant advertises as being halal, there is little chance that the meat is halal. If the restaurant serves pork, I believe that would be zero chance. \n\nYes, he could possibly go vegetarian for his main dish. I just did a quick search about the meat because I remembered seeing something about a halal butcher. There may be other restrictions, some of which could affect vegetarian options.", "NTA tell him he's more than welcome to come to the same restaurant as the rest of you have planned on, but that he doesn't get to decide for all of you all of the time.", "NTA \n\nAny relationship requires compromise and he is unwilling.", "Someone's dietary requirements or religious beliefs is not of particular concern to you. I'm Muslim myself but I wouldn't berate going to a place that serves alcohol or non halal meat. It's very easy to abstain from alcohol and eat vegetarian dishes in such places!

The rice itself is marinated with alcohol and I think there is some content is the soy sauce", "It's a difficult one, but I am going with NTA.\n\nI am a Muslim myself. As a Muslim, I can't eat at any place that serves alcohol or non-halal meat. So a vegetarian place that serves alcohol is a no-go, but a vegetarian place that is alcohol free is fine.\n\nMost of my work colleagues are and have always been non-muslim, and when sorting out after work events, it makes it difficult.\n\nI will suggest a wide range of food places that are not just south-asian restaurants, but steak, Turkish, and burger places, which are all halal. If the group chooses to go someplace else, then all good and I won't join them on those occasions. Or if we are doing bowling, golf, etc, beforehand, I will join them for that, and we'll split afterwards.\n\nThe only thing I'd say is maybe occasionally go to a place that he can eat at, and invite him, but as long as you don't kick him out of the friend group altogether then it's fine even if you don't invite him to eat out", "I have a Muslim friend when we go out for a meal I normally let her pick. But we do go places I pick as well. There has been a few times where she\u2019s ended up with pork on a salad (was part of a seafood platter we shared) or a pork dumpling. So she just give it to me. She did say I couldn\u2019t eat my pork crackling in front of her one night. But she was already feeling off due to fasting so I gave her that.", "NTA.

This Manplayer sounds like he'd be hard work to be around constantly for these after-game social outings. Rather than assume the burden to accommodate his dietary restrictions at all times, why not accommodate him some of the time, then on other occasions, announce where the group is going (not necessarily the south asian restaurant). It will be up to Manplayer to find something on the menu that he can eat or he can choose to sit out those gatherings.\n\nIt's a power play to have you and the others in the group constantly altering your plans to suit him.

That's just selfish", "Going against the grain here, but YTA along with your other friends for uninviting him completely.\n\nMy advice? Take turns deciding where to go.

When they eat out, they eat vegetarian so halal meat isn\u2019t an issue. And they don\u2019t drink alcohol but they also don\u2019t restrict what others drink. If it\u2019s Ramadan, they come along and just don\u2019t eat which is no problem. I would say that it should be a rotation and each person picks on their week within a certain budget that everyone can afford. So you\u2019ll go to his favorite place every 6th or 8th week and he can decide on the other weeks if it suits him or not.", "Don't (at least some) places do vegetarian sushi rolls too?", "Yes, I agree that they should have something that he can eat but not necessarily halal meat.
