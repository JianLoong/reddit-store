You respected his dietary restrictions and went to the places that he liked to accommodate him but he refuses to do that for you guys.", "NTA. South Asian here. I would not expect all my fiends to only go to Indian/Pakistani restaurants. He shouldn\u2019t dictate how others eat. He sounds like the AH and a baby. You can still invite him to the places you want to go. If he complains just say\u201dsorry you can\u2019t make it. Maybe next time\u201d.", "NTA, but you can still invite him. Just invite him once the place has been decided on. Then he can choose to come or not. Simple.", "NTA. Who wants to go to the same restaurant every time? It's your time and your money. He has too many restrictions and is picky.", "NTA.  You tried to include him, but all he does is complain if you don't go to his preferred spot.  Dietary restrictions aside that's AH behavior.\n\nNo pork, halal meat, gluten free, no sushi, and no alcohol means not many options.", "NTA..  hes being way too difficult", "NTA.  I\u2019d offer to rotate on places though.  That way every now and then you go where he wants.  But he needs to understand y\u2019all want to go other places too", "NTA, I feel like a good rule of thumb for this kind of situation (religious and/or food allergy restrictions) is to rotate who gets to pick the location with the guardrails that the location must have at least one of each course that the person with restrictions can eat. IE, if they are Muslim there has to be a salad, appetizer, entree, and desert that fulfill all the restrictions against pork and meat being halal. If that\u2019s a vegetarian option that counts. If he chooses to come, wonderful! If he tries to insist you go to a place he wants to go, sorry- it\u2019s Steve\u2019s turn to choose and he wants sushi. \n\nAlso an important note- his religion is HIS choice, not one he gets to impose upon the entire table. You have every right to get a pork dish and eat it next to him. Or have an alcoholic beverage in his presence\u2026. or even be in a place that has the ability to serve it, good lord that\u2019s so extra of him. \n\nI think don\u2019t exclude him, always offer and make sure he sees he has an OPTION to fulfill his requirements. It\u2019s now on him to decide if he wants to participate", "NTA", "Nta", "Urghh\n\nNTA\n\nI hate Muslims who do this. \n\nWe're not supposed to hang out in places that serve alcohol. \n\n\"But if YOU want to, that's fine! Let me know the next time you go out to eat\"\n\n\"Hey, shall we go out to eat? We can go to that South Asian restaurant so you can come?\"\n\nTHAT'S what tolerance is. You each accommodate one another. It's not about forcing people to go in a specific direction all the time. Sometimes you go out to eat with him, and sometimes you don't. And sometimes... He can try some f**king sushi.\n\nYour friend should know better. \n\nI think instead of outright excluding him though, you should just present it along the lines of: Hey, fancy going Tennis next week? A few of us want to try this restaurant after. \n\nThen if he says no, or tries to get you to change your mind? Just say: That's cool, we can try that place next time, as I think everyone already wants to go to a specific place.", "NTA. If you keep inviting him you\u2019re restricted to the same small set of restaurants. Is it ruder to keep inviting him to eat at places he probably can\u2019t find anything?  Probably. \n\nTry to include him as much you can but fact is he can\u2019t expect you all to go halal every single time.", "ESH- him for obvious reasons with the complaining. \n\nBut you should have at least brought it up with him before just leaving him out. Like hey if you\u2019re just going to complain the whole time you don\u2019t have to come, and it\u2019s a group thing we can\u2019t always just cater to one person. \n\nBut also if it\u2019s always been a group thing, why did it take him a month to realize you guys were going without him? And no one else brought it up that he wasn\u2019t going before then?", "Soft ESH\n\nHe sounds like hard work. He wants you to fully accommodate him while doing nothing for you. But is is a bit of a dick move to just exclude him like that. \n\nHow about this. Everyone is always invited. Each wee every person takes a turn at picking where you eat.", "YTA\n\nThere are much better ways to handle it than just not giving him an invite.  I agree that you should not let him dictate where to go every time, but the group could just go to wherever sounds good and let him chose to go or not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was a once a month thing.  When it was your turn, you got to pick.  One month I picked a Wing House.  One dude, was like no way, that place is crap, when I picked it was steak, when so and so picked we had seafood, etc.  Finally I told him, hey it's my pick,  I'm feeling casual, and IF you can't make it, I understand.  He showed up and of course ordered a grilled fish sandwich, claimed it 'sucked'.  All 5 of us chimed in, \"try the wings\" they're terrific.  Place had 20 large screen tv's and was that time of year when baseball and football was in full swing.  5 of us had a blast.  The next month one of the others chose the same place.  He dropped out after that.  OP is NTA, but I would still invite him, but I would NOT change the destination.", "OP says every time they go to a place he hasn't chosen, all he does is complain. I suspect they're tired of that as well, I would be. Killing The vibes every time you go to a restaurant that you haven't chosen is certainly a reason to be excluded."]}
