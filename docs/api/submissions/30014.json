I think this is where she grew resentment towards us because we were in different places in life and she was upset we couldn\u2019t have our group be similar to how it was in college.\n\nThen into our mid 30s it became a whole saga of she\u2019s getting older and can\u2019t find a husband because all the \u201cgood men\u201d are married or divorced with kids. When she finally got married, many could not attend because it was a destination event and child-free during Covid. This caused a fight because she said how she was there for us during our weddings but we couldn\u2019t put aside a week for her. We had all told her how we wished we could, but it simply was not financially feasible and didn\u2019t logistically work with our kids. But she just refused to hear us out and was simply so inconsiderate about our lives and families, saying we were horrible friends.\n\nNow, Mary just gave birth to her first child and I was very excited for her. The only issue is that she moved from our state to a very remote place that\u2019s only accessible by a 6hr car ride. Her baby is 6mo old and none of us have been able to go up to visit her. I think she\u2019s been having a wrong idea of what a \u201cvillage\u201d is and has essentially demanded in our groupchat that we come up for the holidays and help her out because she\u2019s having a hard time adjusting to mom life.

As much as I wish I could, I cannot physically support her in the way she needs me to do in this stage of life. It would have been completely different if she still lived in our city and this was earlier in life when we had less commitments/priorities.

She shouldn\u2019t have blasted yall online but I understand why she did, not condoning her behavior. Personally, I loved that she got to travel and live her life instead of having kids and responsibility chained onto her so early. You and the rest of your friends had kids instead and that\u2019s totally fine, but it\u2019s frankly gross that you\u2019re blaming her for having kids much later than you and your other friends.

Can't you sleep in her guestroom, or her couch? Or better yet, book a family vacation for a week, of whiich you visit her a few times?\n\nIt looks like your friendship is very one-sided, she made effort, took time and energy to put in you and your family, for 2 decades, and you can't be bothered to return that even once.

Do you have a spouse who can watch your kids? Go meet her baby.", "ESH. Shaming her for her lifestyle choices is an AH move. Her choices are as valid as yours. You complaining that taking time out of your schedule is too much to support her, even after she\u2019s made time to support you in your choices. AH to not giving her ANY type of support at all. \n\nShe\u2019s an AH for not being considerate and assuming everyone has the capacity to support FULLY in what she needs.

She supposedly supported you and the rest of the friend group as new mothers, she's practically begging for your help, and none of you can be bothered? Your kids are older now, it should be easier to arrange a few days of childcare than it would have been when they were infants, but it seems as though you and the rest of the group always managed to do it for everyone but her. Her phrasing it as a demand to come help is dumb on her part, but I think *everyone* sees that for what it is.\n\nPerhaps this is a dead friendship, and it's just not become obvious until now. You're at different points in life, have different concerns, but if you've no intention on visiting, helping, anything really, you should just *tell her that* instead of continuing the charade that you're such good friends.

Caring for friends should not entail putting one\u2019s life on hold to cater to their needs when said friends do not make an effort to come meet you - literally - half way.   \nShe is not in mortal danger, neither disabled or sick. She simply is discovering the pains of raising a family and wants to share that pain. Nothing wrong here. But she is not entitled to anyone\u2018s time or energies or resources.

She got pissed off about it too, because she wanted me to walk her down the isle. \n\nI asked her if she even considered the logistics of a destination wedding. Weddings already require time, money and energy from their quests, a destination wedding requires five times as much.\n\nAlso, while I always congratulate my friends on having kids, I also always make it very clear it's their child and not to even consider asking me for help unless it's getting groceries or something.

I\u2019m driving up at 7 months pregnant to have a small shower up there.

She seem like she has forgotten that and has become resentful. \n\nI suspect the real truth is that she didn\u2019t actually want to be a parent, preferred life without a kid but just did it because she either liked the idea or just believed that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do.

When I got married two of them were pregnant with their first children. They still showed up for me at my bach, my bridal shower, and my wedding. They were still bridesmaids. They were still excited about my milestone. And I was very understanding when it came to what they could and could not do because being pregnant is hard! One of them in particular was a little difficult about (imo) weird things, like she didn\u2019t want her hair done because she was pregnant, but then she was unhappy her hair didn\u2019t look as good as the other girls since I had paid for all my bridesmaids\u2019 hair. Honestly I thought it looked fine but there were lots of weird little things like that I just chalked up to hormones and let it be. And yes, I will say that as one of the later couples to get married in my friend group, there was a bit of \u201cit\u2019s just another wedding\u201d energy from some less-close people. But my best friends never made me feel that way.\n\nAfter their children were born our lives changed even further, because of course they need to focus more on their children. We used to hang out every weekend, now it\u2019s once a month or so if we\u2019re lucky. They can\u2019t go on trips with us anymore. They talk way too much about kids shows. But we still make an effort to be involved in each other\u2019s lives. We go to their kids\u2019 birthday parties, ask about their milestones, and we often hold events in the afternoon so the kids can come, or at their houses after the kids are in bed to make it easier for them to participate. When they can\u2019t make it to a party they at least text us and wish us a good time. We embrace each other\u2019s differences because we care and we know we can still find common ground.\n\nLasting relationships after kids require respect and flexibility from both sides. It sucks to feel like people see your lives as \u201cless than\u201d because you don\u2019t have kids or because in Mary\u2019s case, she had kids much later than her friends. OP, having a baby may feel like old news to you, but to Mary, this is the best most crazy most special thing to ever happen ever, and you should try to reflect some of that excitement back at her, even if you\u2019re in a different stage of life. And on the flip side, Mary is being selfish for moving away and then expecting people to drop everything (with or without kids!) to come visit her, especially for the holidays! If she wanted a village, she should have stayed in the village.\n\nI just think this friendship might have run it\u2019s course because it seems that neither side is willing to bend for the other.", "ESH. Mary sounds super high maintenance and unreasonable for expecting you to drop everything for her. This isn\u2019t about her starting a family later than you all though, it\u2019s about her being 6 hours away and expecting you ditch your own families for the holidays. Even if she started her family at the same time as you all did, it still wouldn\u2019t make sense if she was 6 hours away if you all had kids. Focus on what the actual problem is instead of criticizing her for her choice to wait to start a family.", "Nta the only person she can be mad at is herself lmao", "You are not obligated to take a week long vacation from you own family/kids, but the way you told her off was everything but nice.

Don't you remember the rush of hormones during and after the pregnancy? What a new mother does not need are comments on how her timeline in life is all wrong (according to you).", "YTA. It sounds like you were jealous of Mary\u2019s life and getting a hit of schadenfreude now because she\u2019s having to experience what you experienced.\n\nExcept NOW, she has zero of your support when, from what it sounds like, you had hers. Fake friends seem like an apt description for you.", "YTA\n\nSounds like she was there for all of your milestones and needs and all of you did not attend any single one of hers. And you especially now shame her for being a mom late. \n\nI hope she gets some better friends", "ESH\n\nyou know you can *choose* your friends, right? why are you still being friends with a person you dislike?", "Right. I get the vibe that OP thinks that Mary didn't have to put efforts and pause her own life to attend their weddings and helping them, as she was unmarried and childless. Mary could have made a lot of sacrifices and efforts to attend their wedding and help them out, but now these friends won't even visit her? \nOP claims she can't put her life on pause, but has she thought about the fact that her friend might have done so for her?\n\nI think Mary's wrong for being rude about your life choices, but doing the same thing makes you no different than her.\n\nEdit :Not talking about the destination wedding, it's completely understandable that OP couldn't attend that, but can't she visit her now that she's had a baby?", "Thank you. Makes me think of my friend for whom I sacrificed my only holiday of the year, spent 3K for a destination wedding where I barely had the opportunity to see her and where I didn\u2019t care to go, and now can\u2019t find time to see me other than on a Wednesday from 6 to 8 every other month because of her family. But should be ok for me since \u201cI don\u2019t have one\u201d, not understanding this is not of my own making and I\u2019m desperate for one! Of course resentment builds up", "Exactly this. OP, you describe this as your longtime close friend group. It sounds like there are some logistical issues at play here (destination wedding, her moving away), but if she was consistently there for all of you and you are all throwing your hands up and declining to be there for her\u2026literally at all, in any of these milestones and hard times\u2026yikes.", "Good questions \ud83d\udc46", "Add to that... I just get this funny impression from the post, because it seems to positively *drip* with judgment.\n\nAlso... is it a little weird to anyone else that there suddenly seems to be a running theme of these posts about parents and this \"it takes a village\" stuff?", "Umm but she made the choice as she bragged she could travel because she had no children. Why would she have a destination wedding for guest with children?", "Agree your statement about the timeline and etc was unnecessary.", "Agree. Would also recommend considering that Mary does have some kind of support system. Worry that when new moms say they need help it isn't taken seriously when it needs to be, so at least make sure everyone is safe if you care about the friendship. I did not get the impression that there is much value for the friendship though. Makes me wonder why bother continuing? Mary does not even sound likeable by how OP portrayed them", "Not true. If they had little ones around the same time then they would have been able to bring their child and do play dates. Most ten year old dont want to spend time with a baby.", "If the friend and her sound like assholes , shouldn\u2019t the judgment be ESH? What am I missing", "Hits too close to home huh?", "As the 30+ year old friend who wasn\u2019t intentionally not married in my 20s, I am scared to have kids because of reactions like OP\u2019s - I am Mary, I literally didn\u2019t meet anyone and was single not by choice until only two years ago solidly into my 30\u2019s, and I know that my village probably won\u2019t return the favor for things I\u2019ve done and it really hurts. If this friend group is tight like OP says, it shouldn\u2019t matter that their timelines are different. If this friendship means something to OP, and the holidays aren\u2019t feasible, use your words and talk to your friend - \u201chey I can\u2019t do X but what about Y\u201d and figure out something that does work for you. Plus moving away she probably feels isolated, and to top it off she\u2019s a new mother. So as the friend on \u201ca different timeline\u201d, OP, YTA.", "This especially if she was there decorating, spending, calling off for, and attending all of their earlier milestones!! \n\nThis behavior of the group and tone of OP now feels like singling her out to still punish her for not doing what the rest of the group did when they did. There is no objectively right time to have kids but it seems like OP thinks so.", "No one is ever an asshole for not attending a destination wedding.", "Ikr? Op even bragged about how they all have a husband earlier, how they all have children earlier... based on that Op's children are older now (5 -10 years maybe). She could easily hire a sitter or leave the children with her husband (or other family member), for a day or two.", "Mary moved to the remote area, not OP.", "her \u201cfriends\u201d who didn\u2019t bother to show up to her wedding, birth, or to see her child should be more kind. they are disgusting fake friends", "Oh thank god Dr Peterson can tell me how to live my life. And truly the only purpose of life is family.\n\nFuck that, I travel 5 times a year because I can afford it. I am close with my family and I have a \u201cframily\u201d that are similar to me, I see them 3 times a week. I\u2019m in a relationship, but that\u2019s new enough that I just add it as a bonus. \n\nI don\u2019t look down on people with families. I celebrate my friends and family raising really cool little humans. I\u2019m an active auntie. But if you are gonna throw that \u201clonely\u201d shit in my face? It\u2019s not true, but if you want to play the judgment game, I have so much mor disposable income and freedom to make choices whenever I want. And it\u2019s great", "Or you could be cheated on and have kids who never call or visit. It's all luck of the draw either way.", "This.\n\nMy sister once actually said to me in regards to me listing my recent significant favors to her:\n\nBut you don't have kids to deal with.\n\nThis wasn't about her doing something for me either but me not being available for her.\n\nHad similar convos with friends.", "If someone's a six hour drive from me, I'm probably not visiting them, either.", "I don't understand that married with children OP saying she \"needs to arrange childcare\"........ummmm you have a spouse, why aren't they capable of caring for your school aged children for a weekend?", "Right? A six hour drive isn\u2019t really that far, why is OP all hung up on staying a whole week after a six hour drive? Like that\u2019s a weekend trip to meet the baby", "A destination wedding during covid is just insane if you get upset at people not being able to attend. Then moving somewhere you can't fly, but have to drive 6 hours to and getting shitty you don't get more visits, is just delusional. \n\nI understand if friends who live nearby can't make a birthday party because of kids. I can't imagine expecting people with partners and kids to drive 6 hours to help me out because I was overwhelmed with my new kid. \n\nIf the friend lived in the same area, or even just an hour away it would be different. But you're talking a 12 hour return trip and OP talks about finding accommodation, so the friend isn't offering to put them up either. \n\nYou have to meet people halfway. If they were willing to have the whole family come then it would be one thing. But it sounds like they want helpers and no partners or kids to come.", "they don\u2019t want to go to her wedding (probably weren\u2019t involved in any planning as well), don\u2019t want to visit her and her new baby. like yes OP, yall *are* fake friends. she showed up for them and none of them can show up for her. they isolate her from the group, shake her for not making decisions earlier, then act confused when called fake.", "YTA\n\nThe tone of voice is like \"she's the typical new mother\" as if that is a bad thing. If she is that, she must very stressed out, tired, worried and likely lonely.\n\nIt sounds like there is resentment and envy both ways. Not visiting the friend at all for example little overnight visit when your own kids are not small anymore... Come on. Excuses.", "Relax", "Right. If I have to get on a plane I'm not going.", "Right, meant to write \"she,\" not \"you.\" Brain fart.", "Agree with this. Got to go with YTA."]}
