For starters, all other women in our circle, got married between the ages of 22-27 and we all have multiple kids.

Regardless, she would continue to make comments about how she\u2019s so lucky unlike us because we\u2019re \u201ctied down with husbands and babies\u201d. I think this is where she grew resentment towards us because we were in different places in life and she was upset we couldn\u2019t have our group be similar to how it was in college.\n\nThen into our mid 30s it became a whole saga of she\u2019s getting older and can\u2019t find a husband because all the \u201cgood men\u201d are married or divorced with kids. When she finally got married, many could not attend because it was a destination event and child-free during Covid. This caused a fight because she said how she was there for us during our weddings but we couldn\u2019t put aside a week for her. We had all told her how we wished we could, but it simply was not financially feasible and didn\u2019t logistically work with our kids. But she just refused to hear us out and was simply so inconsiderate about our lives and families, saying we were horrible friends.\n\nNow, Mary just gave birth to her first child and I was very excited for her. The only issue is that she moved from our state to a very remote place that\u2019s only accessible by a 6hr car ride. Her baby is 6mo old and none of us have been able to go up to visit her. I think she\u2019s been having a wrong idea of what a \u201cvillage\u201d is and has essentially demanded in our groupchat that we come up for the holidays and help her out because she\u2019s having a hard time adjusting to mom life.

It\u2019s gotten to the point where she\u2019s posting cryptic messages on Facebook bashing \u201cfake friends\u201d who won\u2019t be there for her. As much as I wish I could, I cannot physically support her in the way she needs me to do in this stage of life. It would have been completely different if she still lived in our city and this was earlier in life when we had less commitments/priorities.

She shouldn\u2019t have blasted yall online but I understand why she did, not condoning her behavior. Personally, I loved that she got to travel and live her life instead of having kids and responsibility chained onto her so early. You and the rest of your friends had kids instead and that\u2019s totally fine, but it\u2019s frankly gross that you\u2019re blaming her for having kids much later than you and your other friends. Get off your wack high horse.", "It looks like you are purposly leaving out information, only dropping little bits here and there like \" she was there for us during our weddings\".

Can't you sleep in her guestroom, or her couch? Or better yet, book a family vacation for a week, of whiich you visit her a few times?\n\nIt looks like your friendship is very one-sided, she made effort, took time and energy to put in you and your family, for 2 decades, and you can't be bothered to return that even once.

Do you have a spouse who can watch your kids? Go meet her baby.", "ESH. Shaming her for her lifestyle choices is an AH move. Her choices are as valid as yours. You complaining that taking time out of your schedule is too much to support her, even after she\u2019s made time to support you in your choices. AH to not giving her ANY type of support at all. \n\nShe\u2019s an AH for not being considerate and assuming everyone has the capacity to support FULLY in what she needs.

She supposedly supported you and the rest of the friend group as new mothers, she's practically begging for your help, and none of you can be bothered? Your kids are older now, it should be easier to arrange a few days of childcare than it would have been when they were infants, but it seems as though you and the rest of the group always managed to do it for everyone but her. Her phrasing it as a demand to come help is dumb on her part, but I think *everyone* sees that for what it is.\n\nPerhaps this is a dead friendship, and it's just not become obvious until now. You're at different points in life, have different concerns, but if you've no intention on visiting, helping, anything really, you should just *tell her that* instead of continuing the charade that you're such good friends.

Aside: Why the heck did she move to such a remote area?", "NTA, Mary is in her right to plan her life to her liking, but she cannot expect the world to revolve around her.\n\nYou have nothing to apologize. Caring for friends should not entail putting one\u2019s life on hold to cater to their needs when said friends do not make an effort to come meet you - literally - half way.   \nShe is not in mortal danger, neither disabled or sick. She simply is discovering the pains of raising a family and wants to share that pain. Nothing wrong here. But she is not entitled to anyone\u2018s time or energies or resources.

She got pissed off about it too, because she wanted me to walk her down the isle. \n\nI asked her if she even considered the logistics of a destination wedding. Weddings already require time, money and energy from their quests, a destination wedding requires five times as much.\n\nAlso, while I always congratulate my friends on having kids, I also always make it very clear it's their child and not to even consider asking me for help unless it's getting groceries or something.

I\u2019m driving up at 7 months pregnant to have a small shower up there.

She seem like she has forgotten that and has become resentful. \n\nI suspect the real truth is that she didn\u2019t actually want to be a parent, preferred life without a kid but just did it because she either liked the idea or just believed that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do.

When I got married two of them were pregnant with their first children. They still showed up for me at my bach, my bridal shower, and my wedding. They were still bridesmaids. They were still excited about my milestone. And I was very understanding when it came to what they could and could not do because being pregnant is hard! One of them in particular was a little difficult about (imo) weird things, like she didn\u2019t want her hair done because she was pregnant, but then she was unhappy her hair didn\u2019t look as good as the other girls since I had paid for all my bridesmaids\u2019 hair. Honestly I thought it looked fine but there were lots of weird little things like that I just chalked up to hormones and let it be. And yes, I will say that as one of the later couples to get married in my friend group, there was a bit of \u201cit\u2019s just another wedding\u201d energy from some less-close people. But my best friends never made me feel that way.\n\nAfter their children were born our lives changed even further, because of course they need to focus more on their children. We used to hang out every weekend, now it\u2019s once a month or so if we\u2019re lucky. They can\u2019t go on trips with us anymore. They talk way too much about kids shows. But we still make an effort to be involved in each other\u2019s lives. We go to their kids\u2019 birthday parties, ask about their milestones, and we often hold events in the afternoon so the kids can come, or at their houses after the kids are in bed to make it easier for them to participate. When they can\u2019t make it to a party they at least text us and wish us a good time. We embrace each other\u2019s differences because we care and we know we can still find common ground.\n\nLasting relationships after kids require respect and flexibility from both sides. It sucks to feel like people see your lives as \u201cless than\u201d because you don\u2019t have kids or because in Mary\u2019s case, she had kids much later than her friends. OP, having a baby may feel like old news to you, but to Mary, this is the best most crazy most special thing to ever happen ever, and you should try to reflect some of that excitement back at her, even if you\u2019re in a different stage of life. And on the flip side, Mary is being selfish for moving away and then expecting people to drop everything (with or without kids!) to come visit her, especially for the holidays! If she wanted a village, she should have stayed in the village.\n\nI just think this friendship might have run it\u2019s course because it seems that neither side is willing to bend for the other.", "ESH. Mary sounds super high maintenance and unreasonable for expecting you to drop everything for her. This isn\u2019t about her starting a family later than you all though, it\u2019s about her being 6 hours away and expecting you ditch your own families for the holidays. Even if she started her family at the same time as you all did, it still wouldn\u2019t make sense if she was 6 hours away if you all had kids. Focus on what the actual problem is instead of criticizing her for her choice to wait to start a family.", "Nta the only person she can be mad at is herself lmao", "You are not obligated to take a week long vacation from you own family/kids, but the way you told her off was everything but nice.

However, the title part is where OP is the AH, because blaming her for making her choices like your choices were objectively and universally better, when she's hurt and needing support, lonely (for friends at least)...kicking her when she's down isn't sad, it's cruel.

You act like she had no other responsibilities during this time. I find that extremely patronising; just because she was single at the time, it doesn\u2019t mean it would have been easy for her to take time off to attend events or if she had the finances to afford wedding things/travel expenses.

Ever heard of people who married young yet had children late due to, say, fertility struggles?  You have described a very snarky and entitled friend, is Mary truly like that? Or was Mary simply describing her lifestyle that was different to yours and you thought she was rubbing it in your face? Perhaps Mary is simply hoping for a little more support from her friend group, even if her expectations are a bit unrealistic? In any case, you sound unsympathetic to her.

I also don't buy the narrative we're being painted about Mary - the way she talks about her - it just seems so derisive and as someone who has a lot of girlfriends actively dating in their 30s (total shit-show btw) it's often less of a choice and often just plain bad luck/lac of options etc", "Something else is going on here.. and definitely some weird resentment from OP. \n\nOp if you actually read this.

Im just not the person I was in college and have very little interest in them ( even though I have fond memories of the time). I think also part of it was BECAUSE I was different, they actually excluded me alot (which made me feel bad). I luckily made friends after that I was much closer to and showed me how friendships should be. Despite this, I would have loved those girls to really accept me and not keep me on the outside.\n\nMary for some reason has stuck by you all this time.

Because there are two very different ways this story could have gone. 1: Mary is being selfish, or 2: The rest of the group has always treated Mary's time like it mattered less, because she didn't have kids or a husband - and now that she has those things, she was kind of expecting it to be *her* turn to matter. But now everyone's backed out on her, because she didn't do it at \"the right time\". One of those leads to an NTA judgement, the other leads to a YTA.\n\nI'm very interested to know how much was asked of her when everyone else was marrying/having kids, and how much she actually delivered. Because that changes everything. She wasn't sitting around doing nothing when she didn't have kids. She still had a life and commitments; everyone does. If she was regularly putting that life and those commitments aside to help her friends, I do think she's allowed to expect the same back.", "Agreed and it's telling that the OP hasn't replied to you. It's ridiculous none of Mary's friends couldn't make it to her wedding or even visit her new baby. The way she assumes Mary has made no sacrifices to attend weddings/other milestone events or apparently didn't have commitments, because she was unmarried and childless, puts her firmly in YTA territory. \n\nI'm betting Mary has supported her friends in many ways and this was probably expected with her being the only single/childless one, but now they give her the boot because she made different life choices. This whole post is dripping with judgement that she didn't marry the first guy she met and start popping out babies right out of college (and I say this as someone who married young and would have had kids straight away, if it were not for fertility issues). There's probably also jealousy, because likely Mary has built a career and has more resources than them due to starting a family later in life.", "Yup. I do a HELL of a lot for my friends, and I'm kind of starting to get the impression I won't even be getting a hen do if I get married because 'oh, it's too complicated with the kids' - like it wasn't complicated for me, earning significantly less than you to take off all that time I did for your hen do and dress fittings and wedding?", "Ding ding!

Not like I have a problem with the kids, I near raised one of them for a bit... The final straw was them repeatedly hyping us up for a group trip \"only\" I could plan just to cancel within days of it, multiple times, because they couldn't be bothered to save money for their share of the trip but yet somehow managed to go out on their own trips without me, literally days before hand then wait till near the last minute to claim \"things are tough you know.. with the kids?

So a combination of ESH but also kind of no one is TA-you're all just hanging on to something that isn't really there anymore. Not attending Mary's child-free destination wedding during covid is understandable. So is not wanting to travel with kids over the holidays. The salient point is that you could do it if you wanted to, but Mary isn't important enough to you to make the effort.

People on here are delusional.", "\"It takes a child to raise a village\" - children aren't raised in a vacuum. They get exposed to other families and people who live nearby, whether it be the parents' friends and work colleagues, relatives of other children their age, etc. Sometimes the expression refers to people actively helping each other out, like babysitting your neighbour's kids so they can go to a job interview or whatever. Sometimes it just means that children will go out there and have experiences and learn from other people without their parents' direct involvement. If your kid is playing with a friend, for example, often both kids will eat dinner at the house they're playing at. It's not much extra effort to cook for one more child, but it can reduce chores and workload for the parents whose child is away for the day. Over time, both households benefit in small ways, and the kids get exposed to how things work in other families, which absolutely does help them grow up into well adjusted adults. Just think of the stereotype of sheltered kids who graduate high school, move away for college, and have absolutely no idea how socialize or live life without their parents watching and guiding everything.\n\nBut the thing about villages is that they're pretty small and local, and as time passes people move and children grow up. The 'village' changes. The environment a child grows up in might not be the same environment 10 years later. Mary wants her old friends to provide that environment for her.

Op doesn\u2019t actually complain that Mary hasn\u2019t been helping them out or going to their milestones. Though she has been quick to complain about stupid things. \n2. I guess this is more from personal experience. If Mary has indeed been traveling and having all these different experiences after college, she\u2019s probably made other friends and sort of moved on. It\u2019s a lot harder to try to maintain past relationships when it\u2019s like this. I mean it takes effort. While OP is still with her friends from college ( probably some husbands as well) so it\u2019s not that much a stretch.\n( I am not degrading either. I definitely took the Mary route because it was who I was. However I think it\u2019s also lovely that the rest of the group was able to go through all these life experiences together.)\n\nBut in the end..

They have their own families and in-laws to visit; the idea that they could just drop all that and visit Mary for the entire holidays is ludicrous.\n\nBut not managing one visit in six months (or rather, longer than that), no mention of gifts or similar to the young mother... that sounds like OP and the rest have checked out of that friendship a long time ago and just didn't bother telling Mary. No, they can't reasonably be expected to do everything she expects; but there has to be some middle ground between that and doing nothing.", "100% OP is also resentful. I married young, but also stayed childfree by choice. OP checks all the boxes for the resentful parents I've met in my life. (Not all parents, just the resentful ones ofc)\n\nI always kept their comments in my head as reversed backhanded compliments. Instead of a compliment that had backhanded undertones, it was insults that always seemed to come from a place of jealousy so it made me giggle.\n\nOP is probably envious of the free time and life her friend was able to live during her prime 20s and 30s, and the friend is now envious of the village OP had when she had her kids. I think the big difference is that it seems OP is looking for excuses to not pay her friend back for the help. If the friend never helped them back in the day, OP would've 100% put that in the post since she spent half of it demonizing her friends choices.\n\nBeing the childless person in a group often means people EXPECT you to help, often with nothing in return. It's why my friendships with parents often faded. It was always giving giving giving but if I ever needed help, suddenly it was always \"Oh sorry, the kids ya kno?\".", "And as if the OP wasn\u2019t the same, but she had Mary and the rest of the friend group to support and help her.", "Yea my 10 year old loves babies my sister just had one and the only reason he hasn\u2019t met his new cousin yet (that he\u2019s been bugging to) is he\u2019s brought home colds/flus twice since she was born and by the time the first round of illness was out of the house and no one was sick he brought home another round of Illness and I ain\u2019t self centred enough to risk getting a newborn sick with anything just to say we met them, so my kid asks then pouts but if anyone in the house has a case of the sniffles we aren\u2019t meeting that baby, went through that with my kid when he was an infant and he ended up in the hospital on a nebulizer, my little brother had a similar thing as a newborn and had to go in for regular breathing treatments and I will not be the one to cause that to another kid in my family and so the 10 year old pouts because he can\u2019t go spend time with a baby yet while learning a lesson in respecting others safety etc despite our own wants.", "So she could have compromised by going only ob a week-end, and if she cant its probably because the husband is just absent.

I hate seeing women judge each other for their decisions on children, marriage, etc. We shouldn\u2019t be tearing each other down like that. If Mary wasn\u2019t ready or wanting kids in her 20s then she was right in not having them and waiting until it was what she wanted. I\u2019m in my 30s and don\u2019t have kids, unsure if I want them or not, and I get a lot of pressure and comments from friends who had them and believe you need to do it asap. My mother was 10 years older than I am now when she had me. She you can\u2019t rely on being able to have kids past your prime fertility years, but having them when you\u2019re unsure or don\u2019t want them just because of time pressure is such a bad idea. \n\nIt is also really true that as the childless friend you end up losing a lot of friends. My friends who make their kid fit their lifestyle and didn\u2019t lose themselves to being a mother are still my good friends. I\u2019ve become more distant with a few whose whole identities became being a wife and mother, and I would constantly try to invite them round and work around their schedules and make sure they know their kids are very welcome but they can never make it work (but can make it work to hang out with the other mums).", "I feel like it\u2019s such a small town thing.

I was never unhappy and rarely felt I was lacking anything just by not having a partner. \n\nI think OP doesn't understand that you make the choices to be happy and do what's important to you, but being single isn't always actively a choice.

I just don\u2019t know if that is happening. \n\nAnd, if I\u2019m honest, friendships are harder at this stage even in my own life because of my family commitments.

In that case there is an option that would make it much easier and more pleasant for people to attend (allowing children).

They could pair off to go visit for a long weekend, but Mary wanting them to come for a week at the holidays just isn't realistic.", "But perhaps Mary wasn\u2019t going to take on board the sacrifices the group/individuals were making in the thoughtful way that you did.

You have Saturday with them, sure, but you're tired from the drive and going to bed so late (your host had to go to bed late too) so you're not getting up particularly early, or you're not doing much that day - or both. Then you're travelling back on Sunday, you probably want to get in around 6 at the latest so you can eat and you can get ready for work the next day and still get a good night's sleep, so you're leaving at midday, so even if you get up at 7, that's only five hours together - you're travelling more that day than you're seeing each other.\n\nIf you want your friends to see you for more than a weekend, you want them to take time off work.

She didn\u2019t even have to ask ***I insisted***. I stayed up 24hrs to take care of the newborn their first night home after being awake and in the hospital for 2.5 days so that she and her husband could get some sleep. Why? Because I **love her** and I get to go home and sleep as long as I want while she\u2019s juggling a 11month and a newborn. 24hrs ain\u2019t crap to me. And I **do** have a daughter and husband and responsibilities. Ya know what my husband did? Held down the fort, took care of our daughter, and took care of our animals so I could be there as long as necessary.

That means childcare and job scheduling rearrangements for a whole week. \n\nYour family is probably personally closer to you than OP\u2019s friend is now over the years, which is why your cost benefit analysis with a 5hr drive makes sense, while OP\u2019s 6hr drive doesn\u2019t.\n\nAlso: a week *during the holidays*.

Couldn't pay me enough to drive 6 hours one way during winter. Some days my own job can't even pay me enough to leave my house in a snowstorm. I guess I'm okay with being considered a shitty friend rather than a dead or injured good one\n\nPlus holiday traffic?? Probably 6 hour drive in the dead of night and at least 8 hours once the sun comes up.\n\nBus or train travel is completely different and more relaxed than having to drive the distance yourself. Being on constant alert is exhausting. 6 hours is 1/4 of a day", "Yeah, even a long weekend is rough, if there are drives at both ends.

Your friend isn\u2019t worth it?", "Exactly, one of my best friends moved across the country (in Europe, 6 hours by train, similar by car) and I visited her when I was single living with my parents, so yeah, every 2 months I was going there, I had nothing else to do lol but now, maybe I\u2019d do it once a year with a looong planning beforehand", "Mid to late 20s and no because I had already lost my daughter by then and was going through the first rounds of chemo. Our friends/family who visited were all either married, had kids, disabled, or all of the above. \n\nMaybe OP\u2019s friend group is different, but in ours (husband and I share the same group of friends), we have supported each other through everything. Deaths, marriages, divorces, children, health crises, mental crises, financial crises, births, celebrations all whilst living in different states - some of us just hours away by car or hours away by plane. I tried writing a few examples, but it turned into a few paragraphs and this response is long enough as it is. \n\nBeing there for one another whether literally, emotionally, financially, or otherwise, wasn\u2019t without difficulty and sacrifice and it didn\u2019t happen seamlessly, but we all put in the effort to help with what we could and that\u2019s what counts. \n\nI could be wrong, and I hope I am, but OP doesn\u2019t seem to be wanting to make an effort - even if it\u2019s just video chatting with Mary or giving her advice. I say this because she seems so judgmental of her and is so focused on how Mary should have done things that she\u2019s completely ignoring how things are in reality. \n\nNot to mention, age and children aren\u2019t the only reasons why someone might have more difficulty visiting a friend or just being there for them. Some single and child-free people have demanding jobs. Others might have an obligation/responsibility to a family member that takes up a lot of their time and energy. Some might not have the mental and/or emotional capacity to support their friend when they need it because they, themselves, might need it. Some, like me, might be disabled and therefore unable to visit a friend without someone to help me get there - literally. I can\u2019t walk on my own for longer than a few minutes, I have seizures on a regular basis - I can\u2019t drive because of this, and I spend, on average, about 30% of the year hospitalized. The point is that I don\u2019t think that because someone is single, in their 20s, and child-free means that they have unlimited time or money. \n\nIf Mary has been in all of their weddings and somewhat involved with their children then she has obviously put in an effort to do so. Just because she was single at the time doesn\u2019t mean it was easier. \n\nBased on what she\u2019s done so far, she still had to take time off of work for any of their celebrations and events, use up her PTO if she even had any and if not then that was just time off that she wasn\u2019t getting paid for which means smaller checks, spend the money one typically spends to attend FIVE weddings, bachelorette parties, bridal showers, engagement parties, rehearsal dinners (and if she was a bridesmaid then it cost her that much more!), rearrange anything she had scheduled, attend various baby showers, buy wedding presents, baby shower presents, birthday presents, Christmas presents, go to children\u2019s birthday parties and other child-related events, babysit or deal with kids if she wanted to hang out with her friends, and anything else I might be missing not to mention the emotional turmoil of it all. \n\nSure, she may say that she was lucky to not be \u201ctied down\u201d, but do you really believe that seeing all of her friends married and with kids was easy for her?? Especially given that these were things she wanted as is made clear by the fact that she is now married and has a child. She was the only one who *didn\u2019t* live parallel lives to one another. She\u2019s had to go through it at a completely different time in her life. And while it is no one\u2019s fault, I can only imagine how lonely it must feel.\n\nAt the end of the day though, friendship is a two way street. If you expect someone to be there for you during all of these milestones, but then choose to not even make an effort to be in theirs, is that true friendship? Do you actually care for the person if you\u2019re not even making an effort to be there for them the way that they\u2019ve been there for you? Again, I could be totally wrong and maybe OP has genuinely tried to see Mary. I don\u2019t know. But based on the way she talks about her so called \u201cfriend\u201d, it seems a bit difficult to believe that she truly cares about helping and supporting her whether it\u2019s by visiting her in person, calling or video chatting, sending a heartfelt message to make her feel better, or anything really to help her feel less disregarded and more included.", "Friend in need only.  Since Facebook, people have dropped an unhealthy attachment to the past.  They don't let go and move on. Its like the old toys at the bottom of the toybox.  Kid doesn't see it or play with it anymore.  But when mom goes to throw it out, the kid talks about how much he loves the toy, and wants to keep it.  The kid might play with it again for a little bit, but after a few days, it's back in the bottom of the box to be forgotten about until the next time mom trys to get rid of it.  \n\nWe have become hoarders of friends.  But when you sit down and look at the relationship, you see the lack of true friendship.  \n\nI was guilty of that for many years until I got off Facebook.

We all do it for our loved ones. Some have done it for elderly parents in need. As the other poster noted I am curious as to how much OP\u2019s friend has been there for OP and the others in the group. What personal or financial support has Mary given them all. I am the single one in a girls group. I am also the one that has a genetic health condition that has necessitated many surgeries and requires regular help. I have been there for my friends over the years through relationships, marriages, births, children etc. And they in turn have been there for me through my health incidents. Sometimes having to take days (or in one case weeks) away from their work/husbands/children. Sometimes to juggle their responsibilities they create a schedule between themselves so they can hand off between themselves which ensures none are away too long from their lives whilst still making sure I am never left adrift. And like OP not all of them live in my city. But in this day of technology, it\u2019s easy to discuss and figure out amongst themselves. \n\nI say all this to say that if OP and the other ladies in their group wanted to be there for Mary, they would find a way to make it work. But again this is very much dependent on the truth of their relationships. If it\u2019s real, they would make it work.", "Whoa. I just wanna say you sound like an AMAZING friend and person! You get it and the people you chose to make these sacrifices to and for must be super amazing people! \u2764\ufe0f", "This comes with strong assumptions that the friend who just had her kid has been that supportive and there for the group.

My brother was 6 hrs away and already had a toddler when my SIL had her cesarean, and I didn\u2019t think twice about taking 2 weeks to help them.

I've never heard about such thing.", "As someone that grew up in a \"fly over\" state where everything was far apart, I'm so jealous that there are people who see a 5-6 hr drive as impossibly long.  I totally agree it's a hassle and you should only drive under circumstances where you feel safe and capable -- but wow we have had different life experiences.", "Maybe it's a regional thing.  But people drive from NYC to DC/Virginia all the time.  And that's like 5 hours with traffic.   I'm not saying I'd do it every weekend, but it's definitely a reasonable trip, especially if you're splitting the drive with a friend for the weekend.  It's not that hard.", "Plus the cost of gas is awful,  insurance can go up because if your doing it often because of to many miles on the car.  Plus you can\u2019t pay me enough to travel close to a holiday.", "This!!! Absolutely this. \n\nAlso this woman doesn\u2019t sound like the best friend anyways.\n*No one* is coming up, and it sounds like she was never that supportive of their families anywaus", "Who cares? Really. Who cares \u201chow much\u201d of a friend she is? If OP expects to maintain any sort of friendship with Mary, from a tiny one to a huge one, then she has to visit the new baby while it\u2019s still a new baby and stop making excuses.\n\nTBH this reads like OP wants Reddit\u2019s permission to dump Mary as a friend", "This is totally fair - I'm in Australia so you drive for 6 hours and you are still in the same state you started in. I've driven Melbourne - Sydney in a day and that's about 11 hours. \n\nIf OP lives somewhere where no-one really drives that far, I guess it's different, but my assumption was the US and it seems like people from the US also are pretty used to long drives (your Texas example for instance) so I figured a 6 hour drive for a 2 - 3 night stay wouldn't be super unreasonable.", "Oh God I didn't even think about Australia, 6 hours might get you to the next driveway over LMFAO", "True bahaha! I'm in Vic so far more condensed, but even then it's 6hrs w/o stops or delays to visit relatives in NSW, and you do that for a long weekend or for one night if it's like a midweek funeral", "In the Netherlands i would be in Berlin or paris in 6 hours :)))\nWould do it for a good friend though.", "Well with the DB you could actually still be at the same station.", "I\u2019ve done both and inconsiderate passengers is a lot less important to me than having to pay attention for six hours on the road personally!\n\nMy response had nothing to do with the post though! But in this context it seems pretty obvious OP doesn\u2019t really consider Mary a friend so\u2026", "Mary is asking them to come down for a week, not allowing them to stay with her (since OP mentioned needing to book a hotel) and is asking them to miss the holidays with their families.\n\nTwelve hours worth of gas to and from your house, I don't see my family for the holidays, I need to use my limited VACATION time off work AND I'm expected to book a hotel? Nah.", "Half the country? No not really\n\nI'd do it maybe on a 3 day weekend once a year or something\n\nHell my parents only  get me 4 times a year and they're just a bit less than that", "While I am child-free by choice (so not the exact situation as OP), one of my best friends from college actually lives this exact distance from me; and when she asked me to come spend a weekend with her postpartum, I found a way, despite needing to take a day off work and make a detoured side trip to my sister\u2019s to drop my dogs. If your friend needs you and actually want to find a way, most people will at least give in an honest try. It doesn\u2019t sound like any of them have even tried to make even a weekend trip, which I\u2019m with you, if she\u2019s really their friend someone would figure out the logistics and make the drive.\n\nThat said, it doesn\u2019t even sound like OP likes (maybe has ever liked) Mary, so idk why they keep trying to string along this friendship. Friendships fizzle out, which is fine, but it\u2019s better to let that happen than to be bitter and a fake friend. YTA, OP for your original question. Mary may not be a perfect friend either, but her life timeline isn\u2019t wrong just because it wasn\u2019t yours, and you are not the world. Plenty of people are willing to meet their friends where they\u2019re at all stages of life and I hope Mary finds some of those people for herself soon.", "Ehh I was hopeless as a kid at 10, no way I could've made myself a (proper) breakfast/lunch lol.

Granted my family isn't the most.. nurturing.", "Even if she could easily leave, her partner (assuming she has one) may not be able to get the time off work. And, over the holidays? Yeah, no.

And for me they don't seem to be friends at this point anymore...", "Hey hey hey! At least buy me dinner first before you start showing me your ass!", "It's not a reasonable sacrifice to ask 5 people to give up a week at the holidays with their kids.", "That's not possible for most people.", "Maybe it\u2019s just the language OP used, maybe it\u2019s just the general vibe OP kind of gives off, but I would take if Mary has actually been \u201cbashing\u201d OP and her other friends for \u201csettling early\u201d with a big grain of salt.\n\nI\u2019m not denying there aren\u2019t women who get really in your face and stuck up because they decide to take their time and/or go childless, but I\u2019ve personally met and/or seen *far* more women who did the opposite get *really* judgemental, pushy and/or just make up their own little narratives that childless/unmarried women look down on them (even when that hasn\u2019t been the case at all). \n\nIf Mary *has* been doing that\u2026 why has OP stayed friends with this woman for that long then? \ud83e\udd28", "The fact that OP says Mary was bashing their lives by saying how lucky she was and they were not and that **Mary** grew resentment towards *them* doesn\u2019t make any sense like at all and throws some doubt to how truthful and accurate OP is.", "I think I would go ESH because it sounds both people think they are entitled to the others help and have crappy atitudes.", "If my parents had told me I was missing Christmas with all my cousins to go stay in a hotel near their friend Mary so I could meet her baby, I\u2019d have braced myself for the worst Christmas of my life.

I'm sorry if people don't see it, but no, it's not just \"take off a week, fly up, and stay in a hotel\" when you have kids at home. It requires more planning and you WANTING to be away from your kids for a week at the holidays (which most parents do not want). If OP, her husband, and their kids went up, it would be a winter vacation and not just a time to take care of friend's baby. Friend does sound like maybe she needs a break, and there are ways to support that from afar. Asking for 5 families to go for a week at the holidays isn't it.", "It sounds like Mary didn't invite the kids.", "It\u2019s a six hour drive each way. Assuming you can fit six in the car, that\u2019s room for five adults. It sounds like most of them have more than one child, which would mean each mom would have to drive separately with her kids, which would be a pain. It\u2019s an entirely different trip with kids, and, as someone else pointed out, then they wouldn\u2019t be able to help like the friend wants because they\u2019ll be too busy with their own.", "Because it's stated in the story that the event is childfree, so they would have to arrange someone for them in that time.

Like I would never miss Christmas or any other holiday with my child just to play free nanny for a friend. None of my friends would ask that either. I've paid for a cleaner for a friend who just had a baby for example, but to leave my family for a week, spent valuable vacations day, just to wait on a sorta friend hand and foot, lol, no. That's not reasonable and no one would expect something like that, at least in my culture. Not even the grandparents do this, why would a friend have to. \n\nThe one point where I agree with you is I would probably dump this friend.

A destination wedding during COVID and living six hours from everyone else are fair enough reasons people might not be able to be there for Mary to the same extent she was there for them, but that seems pretty unrelated to the age she settles down (beyond bad luck on the timing with covid, but obviously no one could predict that). Like, would these friends really have been able to visit MORE easily if she had her kid at the same time as everyone else while still being six hours away? That makes no sense to me. There's clearly a lot of resentment here.", "To be fair, I think Mary is only now asking that they come over the holidays because they haven't visited so far in the last six months. If OP and the others have been making excuses that they are so busy usually, then maybe Mary (incorrectly) thought that they could take a few days during the holidays to visit when they might not have work or school clubs or whatever. Honestly none of the 5 could make the effort to go up one weekend to visit the new baby in the last six months!? If Mary did visit their babies then OP and friends could repay this if they do want to continue the friendship, or else just be honest and tell Mary that they feel they've grown apart.", "It\u2019s hardly a \u201csignificant sacrifice\u201d to visit your friend with a new baby. Mary invited them over the holidays to make it easier to get out of the daily routine with work, school, kids activities etc. as a parent of 3 under 10 in my experience holidays are the easiest times to make visits . Maybe this doesn\u2019t suit OP , and that\u2019s fine, but she absolutely is a fake friend if she can\u2019t visit Mary once in the 6 months since she had her first child. It doesn\u2019t have to be the holidays.\n\n I don\u2019t get why you assume a social visit to meet a new baby will equate to \u201cfree childcare\u201d. It is also my experience that the most helpful free childcare is the other parent who can always do school pick up on a Wednesday so you can attend the all-staff meeting. That can turn into exploitation if you aren\u2019t careful to reciprocate. There\u2019s going to be very few opportunities for OP to be \u201cused\u201d on a weekend social visit.\n\nOP is just a horrible excuse- making fake friend", "Maybe. Something I noticed about my friends who were young when we had kids was our friendships didn\u2019t \u201cdrift\u201d apart until after I had my kid late in life and they didn\u2019t feel like returning all the crazy favors I did for them as a young woman. But maybe.", "I also don't have kids to wrangle. And my friends live in places that I can visit more than 1 person.", "then OP should have said ex-friend, no? You can't have it both ways, staying silent about all the resentment you have for years  and staying friends only to release it when a friend needs help (dah!)", "The child-free destination wedding during covid?

But I also think it's a bit unrealistic from Mary to move six hours away and expect the same level of involvement like when they all lived closer to one another. \n\nBtw I'm almost the last one from my social group to have a kid so I've definitely been more in the supportive role than the receiving role. And I'm completely fine with that because I help on my own terms and don't let people to dictate my life or stomp my boundaries (anymore). Therefore, if I help, it's because I want and can, and I don't expect a quid pro quo. For me this is he right balance but I understand some people want more enmeshment.", "It definitely is a significant sacrifice if it means traveling for hours, not seeing my own kid for a week and miss a whole holiday with them.
