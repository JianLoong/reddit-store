IF you have some left over in your pyrex AND he wants more apple cobbler, he has to ask you if he can have it.  You may say yes.

Leftover meals are fair game usually, but in a healthy relationship if you say that you want a particular leftover your significant other should respect that.  If they also really are looking forward to that particular leftover then split it. This is just basic respect for your partner.  The problem here is that cobbler is not \"leftover dinner\", it's dessert.  Most desserts are too big of a portion to finish in one go.  You don't eat a whole 9\"X12\" cake in one sitting either.
