We spent a lot of time and money, saw numerous doctors, read every book, and cried a lot of tears.  Finally,  just over 2 years ago, my wife finally got a positive pregnancy test.  At our first ultrasound, the doctor gave us the even more amazing news that we were having twins.  We now have 2 healthy and happy 18-month old girls.\n\nWe were recently at a her family Easter gathering and I was talking with the husband of one of my wife's cousins.  The cousin (Sarah) and her husband (Mike) are both in their mid 20s and got married a little over a year ago.  I was talking about how exhausting it can be to have twins, especially since my wife and I are in our mid 30s now and don't have the same energy levels we once did.  Sarah came over as I was talking with Mike and asked why my wife and I didn't start having kids sooner if we didn't have the energy to keep up with them.  \n\nNow, neither my wife nor I kept our fertility issues a secret.  Everyone knows about how much we struggled and how hard it was for us.  Whether Sarah simply forgot that, or was trying to push my buttons, I don't know.  So I told her that she knows exactly why we didn't have kids sooner and that it was out of our control.  She said that we could have tried harder and gave a little wink and nudge to her husband.  I then said \"Let's change the subject.  Sarah, why don't you tell me why you got discharged from the military?\"  \n\nSarah joined the Army at 18 but was mysteriously discharged less than 3 years later.  No one in the family talks about it and no one except for Sarah and her parents know the real reason she got kicked out.  I don't know if Mike knows.  Of course, we all have our theories.  Mine is that she got caught having an affair with someone who was married.  \n\nImmediately after I asked the question, Sarah got up and told me that was none of my business.  I then asked if her discharge was honorable, medical, or dishonorable.  She didn't answer and turned and walked away with Mike right behind her.  \n\nSarah's mom and dad approached me a couple minutes later and started arguing with me.  It got kind of heated and my wife and I ended up getting our kids and leaving.  On the way home, my wife was kind of scolding me until I told her what Sarah had said about our fertility issues.  Then, her whole tone changed and she backed me up completely.\n\nSince then, it has been a huge family issue.  Sarah and her parents think I am a huge a-hole.  My wife's parents are also mad at me for bringing up such a sore topic when we all know Sarah doesn't want to talk about it.  They also think that I did it on purpose to get a rise out of her and make a scene.  They all expect me to apologize, which I agreed to if Sarah apologizes first.  But Sarah doesn't think she did anything wrong.\n\nThere's been a lot of angry texts and phone calls and I'm pretty sure we won't be invited to the family Memorial day party.", "created_utc": 1681932437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s79ne/aita_for_asking_my_wifes_cousin_why_she_got/", "score": 252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The \u201ctry harder\u201d was clearly meant to be a joke after she brought up the topic of infertility and needed an out.   I highly doubt a 20 something year old really paid attention to someone else\u2019s fertility enough to keep it as a common memory.  Did you ever consider she left because she was raped?", "It always cracks me up when bullies have dirt on them and get all shocked Pikachu when the dirt gets used against them. NTA. Wife's cousin started something they couldn't finish. Lol", "I'm going with totally NTA! I hate people who 'tease' others, but when you go back at them, they get all butt hurt. Struggling with fertility is personal, heart breaking and nothing to joke about. A job loss....not even close, unless something happened *to* her, that was out of her control. Which you would only know to stay away from unless she, like you, shared her struggles with the family. But some things shouldn't be talked about, let alone joked about....right Sarah? I also wonder how this all would have gone down if instead OP had been the one immediately running off for sympathy.... Hmmmm....", "YTA. It seems like you escalated this situation needlessly. You don't even KNOW if Sarah was being snide or forgetful. Her insensitivity doesn't warrant a breach into her personal life by you.

You made your fertility issues everyone's business. People are allowed to keep things private. Military service is one of those things. It's none of your business, and you were out of line.

You are just looking for an excuse to vilify OP. Your reasoning suggests ESH, but you want to solely blame OP.", "Sarah? So tell us why you \u201cleft\u201d the military.", "no they weren't, or when OP said \"you know why\" she would have refuted and stated that she didn't.", ">So I told her that she knows exactly why we didn't have kids sooner and that it was out of our control.

Who exactly is better off because you decided to \u201cjab\u201d rather than simply pointing out that what she said was hurtful. Instead, you escalated and are feeling the brunt of Sarah and her loved ones\u2019 reaction to your hurtful comments. That she said awful things first doesn\u2019t just magically short circuit how people will respond to you being mean about a painful chapter in her past.", "Meh, maybe but I still don't think OP is the asshole for responding in kind.\n\nWe always expect the injured party to take the high ground, and be mature but honestly, sometimes a good old turnaround is absolutely justified and fine.\n\nIMO", "Based on /u/33ayin's response that is probably true but, OP admits he doesn't know whether she just forgot. I guess you can be an AH accidentally, or through insensitivity, but if there is a chance Sarah didn't remember and thought she was making a light-hearted ribbing, OP's response was quite overblown.", "You didn't change it ESH for the bot.

What OP said was a blatant attack on Sarah, so yeah, OP is the true AH.", "You *alluded* to it which should have been enough; hence one of the reasons that Sarah is an asshole here. You had more forceful comments in your arsenal not aimed at causing more pain: Curt ones like \u201cThat\u2019s not your business. Stop talking about this. My family planning decisions aren\u2019t any of your concern. I\u2019m done talking about this [walk away]. Don\u2019t bring this up again.\u201d Or just [walk away] without another word.\n\nOr if desired, more detail: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve forgotten or didn\u2019t know, but we had trouble conceiving. We\u2019re overjoyed to be parents now, and comments like those are really hurtful.\u201d\n\nInstead, you intentionally picked a topic you knew would be painful to try to teacher or lesson or something like that. Did that work? Do you feel better?", "There\u2019s a difference between refusing to accept bullying (agreed there!) and no holds being barred when hitting back. There are many more forceful responses by OP that still would\u2019ve  been warranted (not assholish). Literally taking your comment verbatim would\u2019ve been great (the \u201cstruggling with fertility\u201d sentence and then telling her this is not something to joke about). I\u2019m not about that \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d or \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d approach that basically says no one is held accountable for hurting you.\n\nIt\u2019s bringing in of the entirely unrelated military discharge that is assholish by OP here. It\u2019s a mean, incredibly roundabout, and untimely ineffective of way of making Sarah feel shame for what she said.", "They were a lot more enjoyable when Sarah was still in the army and wasn't able to attend.", ">Well it sounds like responding the way your did while knowing about this unfortunate and immature trait of hers didn\u2019t really do anything helpful\n\nI dunno, bet she doesn't bring up our fertility struggles again.", "I get where your coming from, but I have a different view on what it means to take the high ground etc. Often this is thrown around as \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d etc. in ways that discount how the initially injured person was made to feel. I don\u2019t agree with that mindset. \n\nInstead, my thinking is that the turnaround approach just doesn\u2019t work. Rarely are human beings the \u201cand then everyone clapped\u201d audience that the turnaround is meant to please. Instead, adding more pain is, surprise, more painful for everyone. The initial wrongness of Sarah didn\u2019t magically short circuit her loved one\u2019s response to someone being nasty about a nasty episode in her past.\n\nThat reaction is quite predictable. So an injured party who has their faculties (i.e. OP\u2019s comments were calculated and intentional, not a spur of the moment emotional reaction) has a choice to make with much of the above known or at least foreseeable. There are plenty of paths that express rightful anger and shame the injuring party without inflicting more pain and suffering the consequences for doing so.\n\nAnd taking a different angle: even if the premise is that Sarah deserves a negative response after saying something so hurtful, did OP accomplish this? Now much of the family is in hr corner and the blame for hurtful thing she said is commingled with the consequences of what OP said. Shaming her by pointing out how hurtful her comments are without delving into her own past is far more effective and keeping others focused on what she did wrong.", "Thank you! Exactly.", "If you serve less then 4 years and didn't get in any trouble you get a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions. You can only get an Honorable Discharge if you have served 4 or more years.", "Where has it been established that this was a less than honorable discharge? No one knows the reason accordingly to OP and he\u2019s the one that used \u201cdischarged\u201d and then \u201ckicked out.\u201d So it\u2019s quite plausible this was SA>mental health issues>honorable discharge, and the secrecy is because speaking about the SA is so painful. Of course, that\u2019s not certain and this could\u2019ve been a less than honorable discharge.", "I agree that to most couples it would have just been crass. But to say it to a couple you know have really struggled with infertility is just cruel. \n\nThe way I read the post was that they were aware of OPs fertility issues (at least after being reminded of it). \n\nSaying all that I still don\u2019t think that OP handled it perfectly", ">Did that work? Do you feel better?\n\nI bet she won't bring up our fertility struggles again.  And honestly, I kind of do.", "AT the same time Sarah is reminded NICELY about their struggles and doubles down with *wink wink nudgenudge* maybe they needed to work a little harder? As if that was an option? OP gave her a get out of jail free card and she ignored it. I think the response was reasonable. She was given the option to bow out of her insult gracefully and she chose unwisely", "What does she do that makes her insufferable? There is nothing anywhere that states anything that she did that was so bad or anything other than this one comment.\n\nWhat exactly does she dish out and how is her reactions so over the top?", "Another child\u2019s response. She\u2019s more likely to bring it up in the context of telling the story of what you said to her than she would\u2019ve been if you\u2019d just shut down what she was saying without prying open her own past.", "Well then it sounds like everyone is better off with separate celebrations going forward.", "And that's why you're an AH as well.", "So now everyone knows that you are a child who responds a jab with a nuclear bomb. Nice for everyone to know that! \n\nI was all for E-S-H, but your lack of remorse for attacking her after a lot of comments stated that she could have been assaulted makes you a resounding YTA!", "Of course you do. That\u2019s exactly what an AH would feel.", "This certainly is more support for why Sarah was an asshole here but doesn\u2019t really change the calculus with OP. First, assuming she knew exactly what he meant, that certainly makes he conduct even more egregious and warranting considerable anger from OP. Had OP raised his voice etc. at Sarah regarding how awful her comments were, I think that would be quite understandable. But all that establishes that it\u2019s quite hurtful to intentionally make light of or insensitively discuss painful past experiences. To the extent that\u2019s true, doing it a second time because someone else did it a first time isn\u2019t a response to bullying; it\u2019s just more bullying.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not quite clear what that exact actually meant at the time. OP said \u201cyou know why\u201d without further clarification. It\u2019s possible that was true and Sarah recalled it and still said what she did (see above), it\u2019s possible she once knew but forgot, and it\u2019s possible she never actually knew. In all cases her response is bizarre and all of her comments are quite assholish. But that\u2019s still not license for more bullying.", "What's that saying about throwing stones while living in a glass house?", "Agreed. YTA, OP.", "It's still a ESH. Just because OP doesn't feel remorse doesn't automatically absolve the other party of their rude ass comments.", "The message behind that proverb is a good explanation of why Sarah is an asshole for what she said (although she\u2019d be an asshole even without a painful episode in her past). Saying something like \u201cThis is one of the most painful things me and [wife] have gone through. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d feel terrible if someone were saying similar things about your most painful past experiences, so stop talking about ours,\u201d would\u2019ve driven that message home.\n\nThat proverb doesn\u2019t say anything about throwing the stone back at a someone who has ignored the proverb.\n\nIf we\u2019re finding quotes to make our points: \n\n\u201cAn eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation.
