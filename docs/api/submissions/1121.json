Your brother is still with you. Laughing and living through memories and traditions you had.", "NTA of course! That was how you and your dear brother did things and Im sure he would have done the same if roles were reversed. You should continue sharing things with him as you have always done, I think its a great way to keep him with you.", "NTA\n\nIn my culture, is fairly common to split the dead persons personal belongings (whatever is in usable / shareable state, ofc) with close family and friends. I'm wearing my late stepfathers hoodie as I write this and I don't see any issue with what you are doing. It's a way to connect.", "NTA. It's your relationship and your husband can listen to what you say about it or just stay out of it if he doesn't understand.", "NAH. You\u2019ve created your own ritual for grieving based loosely on some traditional customs. I disagree with your husband that it\u2019s bad juju to eat or drink the offerings but if you\u2019re doing that on a daily basis and are obsessively attached, you might want to consider grief therapy.", "Nta. This actually sounds lovely. A great way of keeping your relationship with your brother with you.", "NTA\u2014 I don\u2019t understand the original tradition or the religious belief about where your brother is now, but I think it\u2019s AHy of him to see this tradition you\u2019ve created that helps with your grief and scolded you for it. Your brother loves you\u2014 he\u2019s not going to haunt you for a cigarette. \n\nThese rituals and traditions are the crowd-sourced psychological wisdom m. Your ancestors found that having an altar helps them feel closer to the dead. You do too. Wonderful!  Why does he have to make it weird?", "I think it\u2019s fine if you need to do this to cope. But really...truly and personally I think you need to see a therapist who can help you process your emotional grief."]}
