You dodged a massive crazy bullet.", "NTA at all.\nThis isn\u2019t forgivable. It doesn\u2019t even matter what the thing was. It\u2019s enough of a boundary stomper that she destroyed a possession of yours without your consent. What it was just makes what she did worse.", "NTA\n\nYour ex is cray cray", "NTA she's a monster. you're better off without her.", "I know of a story where a guy had a pic of his mom from when she was in her 30's on his dresser. His gf sees it and thinks it's from the present and that he's cheating. without even asking him about it she rips the picture that cannot be replaced it ends up being a picture of his mom that he valued greatly. needless to say he dumped her.", "NtAH - but your ex is.  Block her and her friends.  Is there any way you can scan the pic pieces in and then use a photo shop like program to digitally fix the pic the tore up?", "NTA. Please listen to all of the adults on this thread - dump her ass. She is toxic and needs to work through her own issues. Run.", "NTA, that girl is nuts and a control freak. You going to let your parents know and maybe ask them to talk to her parents? \n\nI am sorry that fool damaged your items, I am glad you hold the memory, where no one can rip them up\n\nedited, her friends are assholes as well", "NTA. Good for you for breaking up with her.\nAlso, ignore her friends, they're clearly as unhinged as she is.", "NTA. You dodged a real bullet. This was straight up abusive behavior on her part and it wasn't okay. I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "You dodged a bullet good for you.", "Please make this girl your ex girlfriend immediately. This is not healthy or normal and it\u2019s not up to you to \u2018fix\u2019 her. Walk away and you will be glad you did. I had an ex boyfriend like this when I was maybe two years older than you and I tried to deal with it and stayed and it resulted in me literally leaving the country to escape him. You will be glad you ended it. NTA.", "Nta. Tell her parents.", "I am so upset for you OP! I am super sentimental and I can't imagine something like this happening. I hope you had other copies of the photo or got to restore it somehow. NTA obviously", "NTA.   \n\n\nFrom her friend's perspective, they are all likely 16(ish) and immature/inexperienced. They don't know what they don't know. They also only see her (overly emotional perspective) and to them that holds more weight.  \n\n\nShe is insecure. She is feeling very strongly. She has that right, and the responsibility to handle it.  She does not however get to act on those feelings in this manner.  \nYou're NOT the asshole. This person is dead. The photos, letters, and small mementos are all that you have, someone who destroys those for ANY reason is the asshole. NEVER allow a partner to destroy your property and then tell you that YOU are the asshole.   \n(also, it's a crime no matter the reason or object. She cannot steal, alter, or destroy property that does not belong to her, do not let someone tell you that they have any right to destroy any single thing in your home... they do not. )   \nAlways in this situation, you ask the person to leave. Period. It is not that you weren't thinking straight. You did exactly what you should have, and should always do so in the future.She didn't replace the photo, she destroyed it.  Those are very different. She had many other options. That behavior is toxic and abusive... and do not tolerate it in your romantic relationships.   \n\n\n(She could have given you a framed photo to put up in addition to the other photos that you display. She could have misguidedly replaced the photo in the frame but put the original photo in your desk drawer or off to the side, again, misguidedly... and not cool, but could have been dealt with in a conversation, dozens of things that don't involve her destroying your photos, and attempting to knowingly destroy an irreplaceable letter... she's well aware you cannot replace that.)  \n\n\nKeep copies of those photos, and the letters/mementos in a lockable fireproof safe. vindictive/careless/jealous person, flood, fire, all kinds of things happen in your life, take it from someone who learned the hard way, one of those boxes is an investment, but an important one you will use all your life. Talk to your parents, about this incident, and how you'll need one in the future anyway. (You'll want one when you become an adult to put your important papers, IDs, birth certificates, Rental agreements, insurance papers, and small irreplaceable objects into anyway, since you already have something you cannot replace, getting one now is not a bad idea.)", "NTA - she doesn't value you, your opinion or your boundaries. You dodged a bullet.", "She\u2019s insecure.!", "NTA.  And start spamming her friends back with a link to the song \"Sweet but Psycho.\"", "Break up with her yesterday. She is unhinged\n\nNTA", "NTA  \n\n\nMan, you are lucky to get rid of her", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry this happened to you, OP. You're absolutely right to get her out of your life. I'm glad you have another picture. Block her and any other friends who spam you for doing so. You deserve better.", "NTA\n\nDamn. She's like the villian in a movie", "You misspelled ex girlfriend in title.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour gf is young and insecure, but there is no excuse for her destroying such a precious item for you and I am sorry it happened. I worry that she will start bringing this into your current friendships, or be one of those gfs that demand strange women don't park next to you.  Your gf did something very painful to you emotionally, it's okay to tell them to leave while you sort out your feelings.  \n\n\nIt is lovely that you had such a friend and a positive sign that you can love people. People need othe loves in their lives, not just bfs and gfs.", "NTA Stay away from that girl. Only some kind of disturbed person would do that.", "NTA.", "Imagine someone being threatened and intimidated by someone who has passed on, NTA but your ex gf is definitely an AH.", "Absolutely NTA, your ex gf was insecure about you best friend who passed? What the actual fuck? And her friends suck ass to.", "NTA and she really doesn't deserve a good relationship, like, ever.", "NTA if she is jealous of a deceased friend imagine how she will act with new female friends, or female coworkers, or female study partners.  She is immature and likely has a screw loose.  Best be gone.", "NTA. Remove her and her friends from your social life.", "NTA. What she did was awful.", "NTA she had no right to touch your things.", "Wow!!! Good on you for breaking it off on the spot. She never would have changed. NTA x100000!!!", "NTA. Good for you. It scares me that all her friends backed her up - I hope you find someone decent around there to date.", "Omg no NTA i can't believe she would just destroy a photo of yours like that", "NTA\n\nYou lost someone close to you.  We all grieve differently.  I would love photos of me with some of the people I have lost. \n\nChanging the photo, while wrong, might have been tolerable had she not destroyed the phot of you are your friend.  She destroyed your property our of jealousy.\n\nI hope you can replace the phone he destroyed..", "NTA. What she did was incredibly disrespectful.", "NTA, and good news being as young as you are means this relationship is unlikely to last, which is good, you should just dump her and move one. She will always be jealous.\n\nReread, glad you dumped her, ignore her friends.", "Holy shit NTA, and good on you for dumping her on the spot. I'd go one step further and block her and all her friends. Her behavior was immature, disgusting, unhinged, and completely disregarded your feelings.", "NTA. She\u2019s a fucking asshole. I can\u2019t even believer her behavior. I hope you can salvage the picture, but I hope you let the relationship with her go.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA x 10", "NTA. Don\u2019t just kick her out, break up with her and drop contact. Literally so many red flags.", "NTA. She sounds jealous and possessive. You sound like a good friend. She destroyed something precious to you which means she doesn't care about your feelings. Move on.", "NTA - this girl has some insecurities, she has focused these in all the wrong places. I\u2019m glad to see in other comments you have the ability to replace these photos she destroyed. I would suspect the people sending you messages do not know the full story and would be surprised by the truth. Make sure you take the time to process this incident and speak with friends and family about the abuse and incident, talking about how it\u2019s affected you and what\u2019s happen will hopefully help you process it and not bottle up and feeling and resentment that might be growing from this.", "NTA. She is absolutely disgusting. She needs to get some help for the toxic jealousy. To be jealous of someone that isn\u2019t alive? That makes no sense.  Try to block all the people bugging you. So sorry you are going through this. I hope someone has another copy of that picture somewhere that you can have :(", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m assuming though that your GF is also 16, her maturity level isn\u2019t going to be the same as an adult woman. She\u2019s a jealous and insecure 16 year old girl who can\u2019t understand a close friendship you had with another girl.\n\nHowever, you were not wrong to kick her out, she did a shitty thing and destroyed very sentimental property. It\u2019s okay for you to be angry and upset.\n\nMy advice would be to find a group, a lot genealogist groups have subs that restore pictures. Fit the pieces together and find someone who is good at restoration for everything that was destroyed.", "NTA, she is beyond insecure. Not to be one of those reddit that suggests ending the relationship as the best option, but honestly, that is insane behavior, and her friends are just as strange for defending it. The healthiest thing would honestly probably be to end things or hide your stuff in a lock box when she comes over so she can't do it again.", "NTA, might want to warn your friends to stay away from her as she's either crazy or just a rotten person.", "NTA. Break up with her. Her behaviour is so far over the line, you can't see the line from there. She is abusive, basically. She destroyed your possessions, regardless of what they are, because she didn't want you to have them. Then lied about it. I guarantee she told her friends a different version of what happened.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re well rid of someone who\u2019s so jealous of a dead person that they would cross the line of decency and try to destroy a grieving person\u2019s property. Absolutely unhinged behavior that you don\u2019t need", "Apparently her friends are just as crazy as she is. Sorry for the loss of your friend who died. Happy that you chose to lose your gf- the right decision. NTA.", "Dodged a bullet\u2026NTA", "NTA, the destruction is something that I personally would never come back from. \n\nIt's one thing to be jealous or upset but that's what words are for. By destroying that, you might not ever be able to have another copy. And she lied about doing it. \n\nSo if I was you, I'd be done and dusted with that girl.", "Before you kicked her out you should have told you have the picture on your phone anyway just to piss her off then slam the door on her", "My fianc\u00e9e had a friend that she was very, very close with, who died of an aneurysm suddenly about 6 months before we met. I suspect my fianc\u00e9e had some romantic feelings for her friend but never acted on them(or maybe she did, none of my business), which maybe adds to the heartache. Romantic or not, their relationship is none of my business unless she wants to share that with me, and she hasn\u2019t so far. I am fine with this.\n\nI recognize that this person was very important to my fianc\u00e9e and had a special place in her heart, and that isn\u2019t ever going away, nor would I want it to. You can\u2019t just replace people like that, that\u2019s not how people work.\n\nSo every year, on the death anniversary, I come home with flowers and a big hug for my lady, because she continues to grieve the loss of her friend, even 8 years later. YOU deserve someone who understands what your loss is, and what it means to you. I know there is nothing I could possibly do to replace her friend, and I wouldn\u2019t want to anyways.\n\nNot sure what my point here is, just that the right person for you will help you grieve your loss instead of being threatened by it. You made the right choice to dump that girl, she isn\u2019t for you, and she\u2019s made that quite clear.\n\nAll the best.", "NTA. and this just made me very happy. i\u2019m glad you can replace what she destroyed jfc she has issues.", "Make sure you back it up in a second format.  You do not want to lose the memories.", "Drop her ass, don\u2019t even look back, you don\u2019t need that disrespect", "Embarrass her in public make her regret crossing you. You are just remembering and reminiscing on an old friend and she has zero right to do anything even close to what she did so get your get back and play some music and then get in a villainous mood and burn this bridge to form a different one with someone better", "Dude this is just sad she's not the one man, idk how anyone could try to damage something as sentimental as that, this is a huge red flag re evaluate your relation and the person she is NTA", "Please have your parents talk to hers and to her friends\u2019 parents as well, this isn\u2019t acceptable in the least bit", "Same, my first action was to scroll to the comments to see if OP said something about having a copy of the picture somewhere", "Same!", "Yeah before digital cameras and the cloud, you\u2019d have to scan and retouch in photoshop", "We've seen full grown-adults all the way into their 40s pull this same crap on this very sub, although there it's usually with dead SOs.", "And scan it onto a computer or phone too just in case something happens.", "WAY too many stories on here about people doing exactly that, so this is really important advice. (Yes, of course we get a particularly assholey slice of humanity on this sub, but still, I would not be surprised if this kinda thing happened again.)", "And *that's* how it's done. No ridiculous competitive feelings, no jealousy, no trying to make it about you - just respect for the loss.", "You are a good person!", "It\u2019s shocking but in the long term a much better thing that they have so little lack of self awareness that they do something at the start of a relationship that\u2019s a huge red flag and get dumped", "who broke your heart?", "This behavior will scare off any decent person OP would want to be with. This is terrible advice.", "I don't expect such behavior even from 13-14 years old. The person the GF was jealous of is dead after all. She was no threat whatsoever.", "Thank you. I\u2019m just doing what I can to make things easier for her to grieve and process.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine being such an asshole as to make her(someone I love) not only have to deal with her loss *alone*, and feeling like she can\u2019t share her feelings with me, but adding on top of that making her have to juggle and manage *my* emotions and feelings, too. That just seems mean. If you love someone you don\u2019t put them in a position like that.\n\nHopefully OP will soon see that this break up is a good thing. The only thing worse than feeling alone is being *with* someone and feeling alone.", "Thank you.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 real recognize real. Glad you could see what horrible advice that is lol", "Honestly no one and everyone i kinda live a goodfellas type lifestyle if ykyk so i don\u2019t let stuff slide like you no diss i just got to give you a free piece of advice. Someone who thinks that they can do something to you like this probably thinks they can do it again so make sure that you show mfs that you ain\u2019t a biftch and that no mf can try you", "Advice is worth what you pay for it. That\u2019s why your advice is free.", "Yeah! Its super clear to see who spends a lot of time on reddit, yknow, based off karma, post, and comment counts... so we both dont spend much time here, clearly. Nevermind the fact I didn't state my age, which is barely not a teen so like...yeah, I think I can use some pretty fresh hindsight. The hair color comment is the clearest to me, considering hair color being bright is a common mental health strawman, that you really need some hindsight of your own.", "Someone is offended\u2026 lol, i don\u2019t see how my og comment was ever such a big deal. I apologise if you were offended about my statement of hair colour??\u2026"]}
