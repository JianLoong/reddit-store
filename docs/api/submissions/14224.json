Talk to your parents, about this incident, and how you'll need one in the future anyway.

She is absolutely disgusting. She needs to get some help for the toxic jealousy. To be jealous of someone that isn\u2019t alive? That makes no sense.  Try to block all the people bugging you.

It\u2019s okay for you to be angry and upset.\n\nMy advice would be to find a group, a lot genealogist groups have subs that restore pictures. Fit the pieces together and find someone who is good at restoration for everything that was destroyed.", "NTA, she is beyond insecure. Not to be one of those reddit that suggests ending the relationship as the best option, but honestly, that is insane behavior, and her friends are just as strange for defending it.
