We both were super close and hung out often. Before she died, she gave me a couple letters and told me when to open them. They were letters to open on certain birthdays like my 18th and 16th. I opened the one for my 16th recently and I cried because of the contents. The letter wished me and said some other sentimental stuff. I have a few pictures of us together framed in my bedroom and some of her stuff like her artwork and her bracelets. Her parents gave them to me because they knew how much I valued it and they weren\u2019t going to do anything with it. \n\nOnto the issue, I started dating this girl around 6 months ago and she came over to meet my parents and hangout. She knows about my best friend btw. When we were hanging out, she saw the pictures of us together and said that I was too close to her in the pictures and it was making her uncomfortable. I replied that she was by best friend and those pictures mean a lot to me. She dropped it. Yesterday, she came over again and when I went to use the back room, she had changed the picture of us and replaced it with a picture of r and my gf. When i came back i noticed the picture was gone and when I asked she said she didn\u2019t know. I was like what the fuck pictures don\u2019t just replace themselves. My parents weren\u2019t home(yes they knew my gf was coming over they trust me). I looked around and I saw the picture of us ripped apart and in the trash. I was very emotional and angry so I kicked her out of the house and broke up with her on the spot and said \u201cyou\u2019re crazy for competing with a dead person\u201d. Now her friends are all spamming me saying i\u2019m a horrible person.\n\nI forgot to mention that she also tried ripping the letter but she accidentally ripped something else\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680886891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12eruut/aita_for_kicking_my_gf_out_of_my_house/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being jealous of a dead person, seriously? I bet she told her friends completely different story.

Gotta love technology lol", "In this day an age ive never met a 16 year old that is that immature unless they need some sort of help. Im 18 and never met a 16 year old like that unless their hair is rainbow. Older generations look down on teens as if they are still babies and give them hall passes to act like psychopaths. 16 is very much a maturing age, you\u2019d expect that behaviour from a 13-14 year old but not 16."]}
