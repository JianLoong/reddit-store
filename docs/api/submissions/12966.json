It\u2019s weird how she was inviting herself to this cruise in the first place. NTA and I would avoid any interaction with this woman. Sounds like she\u2019s trying to get it on with you. I can see how this would bug your ex, maybe you guys can have a talk again and clear the air.", "NTA; she invited herself, it seems; and assumed you would cover her costs for the trip; never offered to pay her share or even make an arrangement with you. If anything, She the AH", "Better show some screenshots to your ex to show her you never offered\u2026. And you need to get this \u201cfriend\u201d to understand where she stands\u2026\u2026. An angry ex with kids is a nightmare.", "NTA it was a straight up misunderstanding...of course your ex who you didn't split with amicably is not on your side  lol  \n\n\nAsk yourself:  Do you care what they think?  \n\n\nAlso kind of sounds like the friend is trying to get with you, inviting herself onto the cruise with you.", "NTA:  The AH is the woman who is trying to get a free trip out of her best friend's ex husband.", "NTA. I feel like this friend/bridesmaid was specifically looking for ways to cause trouble", "NTA. Sounds like you were just having polite conversation. She definitely took it the wrong way, no one plans a trip by saying \"yeah you can come\" and offering no further details. She's probably trying to stir up drama and it worked. \nAs for your ex, she may have sensed her friend had a crush on you while y'all were still married, and the friend more than likely embellished when she told her. I'm sure her feelings are justifiably hurt that now y'all are divorced Youre going on a trip when you never had one together, but those are normal feelings of realizing a relationship is over and she shouldn't take it out in you. Enjoy your trip!", "NTA she invited herself and didn't give u any conversation... she assumed  with out a real conversation", "NTA what that girl is messy stay away and how is the ex not mad at her \u201cfriend\u201d for wanting to go. Go enjoy your trip !", "NTA, she invited herself there and that's on her for thinking you would just be fine with that, though for the future, when someone says \"could\" in regards to themselves, especially \"could come with you on a trip\" they are very clearly indicating that they want to come with. If you notice language like that, nip that shit in the bud right away in no uncertain terms so they don't plant ideas into their own head and blow up later. Its still her own fault either way but it would have potentially saved some drama or forced her to be more upfront with you on why she wanted to go with(in this case she was very clearly looking to hook up with you).", "She imagined being led on. Even if she thought you supposedly said she could, it was up to her to book her own cruise. Wish you had asked her when did book her cruise? Like knew you wanted to come and lie and say glad you got it booked. Learn that next time someone is got their sights set on you, to tread carefully answering. Your wording of it was where you goofed. But even if you meant okay she could come, it wasn\u2019t saying you were paying. I would have been too embarrassed and have too much pride to invite myself to anything. NTA.  I know when hubby asks me if I could fix him fried shrimp and I say I suppose I could. It\u2019s actually saying yes but don\u2019t want to, but will, just to shush you.", "NTA what that girl is messy stay away and how is the ex not mad at her \u201cfriend\u201d for wanting to go. Go enjoy your trip !", "NTA - I don\u2019t know if you are just gullible or have a problem reading people. She was looking for a free trip. She invited herself and expected you to  be thirsty. Send this post to your ex since she\u2019d rather be angry with you than to recognize that her \u201cfriend\u201d is shady.", "Its weird that she asked to come and its weird that you said that she could join you. Do neither of you know how to properly communicate", "NAH - I think this is all due to poor communication and assumptions being made. The fact that a miscommunication like this created this level of drama speaks a little to the dysfunction of your friend group in general (i.e. you and your ex hanging out 9 months after a less than amicable divorce). Best thing is to just be transparent, explain what happened from your perspective, apologize, and if they don\u2019t accept it look for a new friend group. That might be the healthiest option at this point anyways", "NTA so she just invited herself and fully expected you to pay for it all. She sounds delusional stay as far away from her as possible", "NTA. But I think you need new friends.", "ESH. You indicated to your friend she could come with you. She\u2019s an AH for inviting herself and not being clearer in her expectations. This situation has nothing to do at all with your wife. She\u2019s an AH for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

It sounded like some sort of signal was being put out there.", "NTA. Ex-wife no longer has any say on anything you do that doesn\u2019t directly affect the kids. \n\nAlso, 29f is looney for reading playful banter as an actual invitation without having a discussion where you explicitly agree you\u2019re doing this together.", "NTA you just mentioned you were going on a cruise by yourself. There\u2019s no proof anywhere of you inviting this woman. I would text the group chat to clear the air that she took it upon herself to assume she was being taken on a full ride.

I said she could I supposed but didn\u2019t really say \u201cyes\u201d\"\n\nI feel like if I said \"I could come\" and someone said \"You could, I suppose\" - in my mind I'd take that as an invitation or at least a clear statement that it's possible for me to come along and join the cruise. With that being said, I know you didn't mean it that way and it was a miscommunication. You may have to do some damage control and explain how you never intended to invite her, but that may involve apologizing for being vague in your response. Other than that, your friend is definitely trying to be sneaky because clearly she was not intending on mentioning the cruise to your ex until she felt tricked.", "NTA", "NTA", "ESH.\n\n> She says she could come with me\n\nThis is her asking if she can come with you. A bit inappropriate and presumptuous to ask to go on vacation with just herself and her friend's ex (you). She's an AH for this.\n\n> I said she could I suppose\n\nThis is you saying that she can join you. If you didn't mean it you shouldn't have said it. You're an AH for this.

I have a single cabin. I'm not trying to hook up with whatshername. I never invited her to come with, she asked if she could go on a cruise and I answered in general terms that in no way represented an actual invitation or offer to fund someone else's vacation.\""]}
