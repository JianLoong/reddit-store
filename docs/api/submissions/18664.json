Before her passing, she had a birthday party despite being in frail health. That night, I was with Ruby and my sister-in-law, June. We were chatting and I complimented Ruby\u2019s ring. To my surprise, she took it off her finger and gave it to me! I initially protested, but she insisted it was a belated welcome to the family gift. I was deeply touched. My husband and I had met and married while working abroad, and we had recently moved back, so I was still getting to know his family.\r  \n\r  \nJune appeared shocked but remained silent. My husband was thrilled when he found out. He suggested we insure the ring. Turns out it\u2019s worth a lot!\r  \n\r  \nRuby's health deteriorated, and she was diagnosed with dementia. A few months later, she passed away. I wore the ring to her funeral, and someone asked if June had given it to me. I clarified that Ruby had given it to me as a gift. The woman was surprised and told me that everyone knew the ring was meant for June.\r  \n\r  \nA few days later, I went to June's house to talk. June was quiet and said that the ring was mine but admitted that Ruby had promised it to her when she passed away. She explained that if Ruby had changed her mind and wanted me to have it, she didn't feel it was her place to protest.\r  \n\r  \nI told June that the ring was beautiful, but I believed it was rightfully hers. Ruby had promised it to her since childhood. I mentioned that Ruby had likely been confused that night due to her drinking and possible dementia, giving it away by mistake.\r  \n\r  \nJune burst into tears. She confessed that it hurt when Ruby gave me the ring and went back on her promise. She loved the ring and had even borrowed it for her wedding. She also shared that she and Ruby had bonded over the expectation that the ring would eventually go to June's daughter. She was so happy and started wearing the ring daily.\r  \n\r  \nWhen my husband found out, he lost his shit. He started yelling that it was completely thoughtless of me to give June the ring. That the ring was gifted to us and it wasn\u2019t mine to give away. That it was worth a lot of money and if we ever got into an emergency we could sell it.\r  \n\r  \nI was completely baffled. We are financially stable, and he has never shown any interest in jewelry before. I \u2018ve never seen him so angry and upset. He demanded June return the ring. She refused and he insisted she give us the cash value of the ring. June told him to piss off. I called him an asshole and he accused me of being thoughtless. It has been two weeks now and June is not speaking to my husband and things are tense between us.\r  \n\r  \nI got to thinking and AITA? I did not tell my husband I was thinking of giving the ring to June. I did not consider how expensive it was or that it could be used as a potential emergency fund. I thought I was doing a good thing but now everything is tense and it feels like I made an awful situation even worse.", "created_utc": 1685550337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wqur8/aita_for_giving_away_an_expensive_ring_to_another/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you as stable as you believe to be?\n\nYour husband's reaction that the ring was a \"gifted to us\"  is also questionable.", ">That the ring was gifted to us\n\nNTA. No the fuck it wasn't. It was gifted to you by someone who was drunk and probably already suffering from dementia. Your husband sounds greedy as fuck.", "NTA. You may be right about Ruby not being in the right mind, but she also may have intentionally meant to give it to you- you\u2019ll never know. \n\nHowever I think you did the right thing passing it along to June because she didn\u2019t want it for the financial worth like your husband appears to have.", "That was so kind of you and absolutely the right thing to do. You are NOT the asshole. Your husband is being very weird.", "NTA You made the right decision and I'd be looking at my husband with a new light if he had said that to me", "NTA - but your husband is. The only thing he sees in that ring is dollar signs. June actually loved the jewelry, has worn it during a life milestone, and had talked to Ruby about it becoming a family heirloom. I guarantee you Ruby had rather it stay in the family than be sold to the highest bidder.", "NTA. You weren't obligated to gift June the ring, but you had a right to make that decision. You did it for all the right reasons.", "NTA. Thoughtless? No. Most definitely not. Your husband however........", "NTA, check your accounts, check everything. Firstly she didn't gift him the ring, she gifted it to you personally. It's absolutely yours to give away. He's suddenly happy he got a ring worth a lot and is outraged when you gave it away to a family member who everyone thought was getting it?\n\nThis is the kind of thing you often find out later is because the husband has a gambling problem, or their business is going under, or, well, they have a second family or a second apartment they keep secret so are struggling financially but pretending not to be. \n\nThere is zero reason to suddenly be incensed that a ring gets gifted that you never had before and when you have zero financial issues.", "NTA. Your husband it's wildly wrong here. It would be hugely unethical to take a very expensive gift from an elderly demented relative who'd been drinking- especially when she'd promised the ring to June in front of multiple people. What in the world is he thinking??", "NTA. You did what so many don\u2019t. My grandmother got dementia and passed away. There were heirlooms promised to her elder granddaughters but in her dementia, the youngest of the all the grandchildren went and took everything claiming my grandmother gave it to her. We all loved our grandma and each piece was something special that was meant for each of us but none of us got anything. We all know who was supposed to get what and we respected it. Obviously the other one didn\u2019t care. The pieces are either melted or sold now for more \u201cmodern\u201d designs and that\u2019s the saddest thing.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. The ring was given to you (dementia or not) and was yours to do with as you wished. The ring seems to hold a lot of meaning and memories for June, your husband on the other hand is only interested in money and most definitely the asshole.", "NTA.  You did a kind and generous thing. No one will ever know what Ruby was thinking that night, but the drinking and on-coming dementia are certainly factors.  I am so sorry you're in the middle of a family argument, I feel sure that Ruby never intended that. You're a lovely person.", "The ring was given to YOU, not your husband. He has NO say in the matter.\n\nI think you did the right thing by giving the ring to June. It is likely that Ruby forgot she promised it to her. I commend you for your upstanding ethics and not taking advantage of the situation.\n\nNTA!!!", "You are an absolute angel married to a demon! NTA.", "NTA, you are a beautiful, compassionate, and thoughtful person. Your husband, unfortunately is the ass.", "NTA. You did the right thing even if your husband can\u2019t see it.", "NTA, what you did was very kind and understanding.\n\nAre you sure you and your husband are financially secure? You should pull up your guy's free annual credit report to check if there's anything fishy going on.", "1. Selling jewelry does not give the seller near as much money as they might expect.  Certainly not the appraisal / replacement value\n2. Ruby had made promise ot another family , had been drinking and maybe in the early stages of dementia when she gave you the ring.\n3. When Rob was on sound mind she had promised it to June, and June wore it on her wedding day.\n\nYou husband is being dollar signs and ignoring the family.  He may not have know what promises where made as you were out of the country.\n\nWhile he is (perhaps) legally right, Ruby gave it you, it could be argued that she wasn't;t of sound mind.  There is also a ethical aspect to.  June had been promised  the ring, she and Ruby had talked about it more than once it seems.\n\nYOUR actions smoothed over what could've been years of resentment.  I think you did the right thing.\n\nNTA\n\nETA:  Something that happened to me decades ago.\n\nShortly after my child was born, my mother talked me and wanted me to have a very specific ring that she wore everyday.  All the kids were aware of this ring.   It had two larger stones in the setting.  She didnt give it to me then. Thats fine.\n\nAbout 18 months later, both my parents had died and we (the four kids) were divvying up things. As we were involved in the process of division,  it was suggested that the two stones be removed from their setting and two different sibs take a stone each.  I was sad.  It didn't work out the way Mom wanted.  I couldn't argue because there was no specific clause that said I should get the ring.  My parents will was very basic.  The sibs should divide things equally.\n\nOver time, I have made peace with what happened on that day.  My siblings got something, while I got something else.  I don't even remember what else I got.  I was willing to walk away from the ring for the goodwill of the family.\n\nI don't regret my decision.  I would not have worn the ring, not my style.  It kept the peace (for a little while). It made two other sibs happy.\n\nYou were kind, generous, magnanimous in giving the ring to June.  She will never forget it.  Others will never forget it either.  such gestures go a long way if keeping families together.", "NTA.. once the situation was explained to you, you did the right thing.\n\nI'll bet a dollar your husband damn well knew that ring was earmarked for his sister,  and he damn well knew what it was worth. His behavior here is icky. Yours is not", "NTA.\n\nIs he managing the financials? Or do you both do it? Is he shifty about bills and stuff? Are you really still financially stable? I think that thought process of his is concerning and a red flag. Maybe he is not telling you something.", "How much money are we talking here?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I will say you did the right thing but lightly are the asshole as well in your relationship for giving away an item potentially worth thousands and not consulting your husband or talking about it before hand.", "NTA. The ring was a gift to *you*, not you and your husband. You recognized that Aunt Ruby's mental condition was behind her giving it to you instead of June. You rightly passed it on to the person who had expected to receive it. None of hubby's business. You saw a beautiful heirloom, he saw dollar signs. Oh, and kudos to June, too, for not rudely demanding the ring in the first place!", "OP, You are a really good person! You did the right thing, and you did it so graciously and respectfully. A man worthy of you would be proud of what you did. I'm sorry your husband is falling short, and you have to figure out what to do having seen this side of him.\n\nNever, ever regret giving the ring to June. Frankly, the good you put into the world with your action is something warm and inspiring to both mind and heart.", "So you were given a gift by a dying old lady with dementia. She promised the ring to someone else. You being an understanding mature and kind person reached out to the equally mature intended recipient and gave your gift to her. Why is the greedy husband involved at all? It wasn\u2019t a gift to him. It wasn\u2019t meant to be a safety net. He demanded money from June. Wtf? That makes no sense. \n\nI would say keep your finances and assets separate. NTA", "NTA. Make sure to let your husband know that if you find yourself in financial straits, you are more than happy to part with your wedding ring and any other jewelry he\u2019s given you for some quick cash."]}
