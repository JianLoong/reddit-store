I\u2019m feeling a bit guilty now.", "selftext": "For context my wife\u2019s birthday was a few days ago, I took her out last weekend somewhere nice for just me and her to have lunch and I took her out and did a whole walk/hiking day which is her favorite thing to do. This weekend her parents wanted to take her out to dinner, wherever she wanted to go. She asked my opinion on it, and I simply answered \u201cliterally anywhere except shoguns is fine\u201d. She knows I don\u2019t like the restaurant, I just don\u2019t like the flavors. Her dad loves the place so we\u2019ve been there often, every single time I have not liked it, so I came to the conclusion I just would stop going there. Spending $30 on a plate of food I won\u2019t eat seems ridiculous. Cue todays events, we went out with her parents and our kids, had a nice day together. \n\nTime comes to decide where we\u2019re going for dinner, wife and family says shoguns. I think \u201cokay, no big deal I\u2019ll just get a kids meal or something (chicken strips and fries)\u201d. I remind my wife on the way to the restaurant that I don\u2019t plan on eating anything off the menu, but I would be more than happy to sit with everyone, enjoy the company, and I will order the chicken strips. She\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy, all good. \n\nUntil we get to the restaurant that is. Turns out the kids meals are only for 10 and under, obviously I\u2019m way over that age limit, so I thought \u201cno big deal, I\u2019ll just relax and enjoy the company, then I\u2019ll grab some food when we leave\u201d. Oh no, according to shoguns policy you have to pay per person whether or not that person is eating. They wanted me to pay $10 to watch other people eat, when the kids meal would\u2019ve only cost $7. So I asked again if I could just get the kids meal then, they refused, my wife was getting upset over the $10 charge for me to just sit there, so I told my wife I\u2019m not paying $10 to watch everyone else eat dinner, fuck that. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting outside in the car, my wife is mad at me, and my wife\u2019s parents I\u2019m sure are not thrilled as well. I guess I\u2019m just feeling guilty, so the real question here is AITA? Should I have paid the $10 to sit at the table and watch everyone eat food that I can\u2019t even stand the smell of?", "created_utc": 1684015634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gu7jh/aita_for_walking_out_of_the_restaurant_during_my/", "score": 689, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's never anything I can eat there, and the smell makes me kinda queasy for some reason. Maybe we could go somewhere else? That great Italian place you loved?\" Or something like that.

You also revealed for your wifes birthday that YOU would be picking up her and your tab. You don't invite someone out for their birthday and expect them to pay. Poor or not, it's extremely rude.

THAT is either selfish asshole behavior or passive aggressive asshole behavior. Might be both.", "That's just silly. He didn't veto anything. She asked him, he said anywhere but there. \n\nVeto would be if she suggested it and he forced her not to go.", "Eh, but he was just making his (fairly reasonable) preference known.

Referring back to my own example, my husband knows I hate this specific diner and will avoid it at any cost. We wind up going there anyway for various family events that we're given no say in, which is whatever, and if he really wanted to go there for his birthday, I'd absolutely suck it up. But if he asked me if there was anything I was in the mood for, or anything I wanted to avoid, and I specified that the only thing I didn't want was the shitty diner, and we went there *anyway* (especially without his having mentioned anything about it-- in that conversation or even later like \"you know, I was thinking about it and could just really go for a patty melt\" or whatever), I'd be feeling like my input had been intentionally disregarded.\n\nAnd yeah, to be honest, the $10 would put me overboard.

Sorry.", "There are fries on the menu. There are drinks and appetisers or even deserts to have a bite of something.", ">dude no matter what fucking day it is only a moron and a schmuck would pay to literally just sit at a restaurant.\n\nCool, now he gets to enjoy a fight with his wife where he's clearly wrong. Congrats on saving that $10 though.", "Remember that this is after he refused to eat any of their entrees or appetizers, and demanded a kids meal.

His post clearly says \"I told my wife I'm not paying $10\" and now after the fact he is trying to claim it was her that was \"freaking out\" over $10. Those are completely opposite things and his original statement that he was the one refusing to pay makes much more sense in the context of the entire story. I believe he is trying to twist the narrative by changing it to his wife.", "None of that is really relevant though, there was no reason to get upset over $10 and leave the restaurant during dinner.", "Or at least let him know she might still pick that place when he mentioned it.

He put her in a bad position and over nothing really, he hasn\u2019t enjoyed it recently and doesn\u2019t want to pay for food that\u2019s not great. That\u2019s not a good reason to boycott your FIL\u2019s favorite restaurant when the in-laws take her out for a birthday dinner.

He chose to throw a temper tantrum after he agreed to go. Eating from a kids menu isn\u2019t reasonable and neither is paying $10 to stay but honestly suck it up and order an a la carte or side item or pay the $10 because for however many times they have been there they both neglected to look up the menu beforehand. I\u2019ve never heard of this $10 minimum and wonder why he didn\u2019t just order like two alcoholic beverages and plan to eat when he got back home.

There are limited seats and they do combine groups so he'd be taking up a space they could give to a paying customer. It's not like a regular table where the whole table is yours whether you have 1 person or 4.

I had a friend who didn't drink (no particular reason, really, she just didn't really like alcohol...she'd have a wine spritzer or some sangria once in a blue moon, but it just wasn't something she enjoyed regularly), and it was always an issue. She would offer to pay the equivalent of 2 basic drinks if she could just have some water and hang with us, and over half the time she'd be forced to order drinks she slyly traded with us after being harangued by servers.\n\nNowadays a lot of venues have mocktails, and she would have loved that back then.

But OP\u2019s wife seemingly doesn\u2019t feel the same way. And, to be fair to OP\u2019s wife, she *had* already gone to a restaurant to celebrate her birthday with him where she *could* enjoy the food there *with* him. This birthday dinner was specifically with her parents.  \nI personally find it interesting how even though it was OP\u2019s wife\u2019s birthday, her opinion of either restaurant seems to be entirely excluded from this narrative. He mentions he took her \u201csomewhere nice\u201d but doesn\u2019t explicitly say he took her to her favorite place. He *does* explicitly mention that he took her to do her favorite *activity*. He then mentions her *dad\u2019s* opinion of the restaurant, but not hers. Are we to assume that she only chose Shoguns for her birthday dinner because she knows her dad loves it *so* much and she literally just doesn\u2019t care about her husband\u2019s dislike for it at all? That\u2019s a bit of a leap. I think it\u2019s much more reasonable to say that perhaps OP\u2019s wife *really* enjoys Shoguns and doesn\u2019t go there with her husband really at all, but takes the opportunity with her parents because she knows her dad loves the place. \n\nAt the end of the day, I personally find their whole \u201cpay $10 to watch other people eat\u201d thing to be ridiculous. However, if this is an establishment like a Teppanyaki grill where multiple parties are sat together at the same table and each seat *is* money, it\u2019s a bit more understandable. However, I also find it pretty rude that when she asked him for *suggestions* for the birthday dinner, he did not *give* a suggestion, but instead gave a condition/exclusion.", "Projecting irrelevant stories to make the husband look bad is a sport here", "Exactly this. My BF is not a big fan of sushi, and I am, so I make sure that if that's what I want when we go out, the restaurant serves a variety of other dishes. I have never had trouble finding a Japanese restaurant that serves bang-up sushi and has at least a half dozen non-sushi entrees on the menu. He can order a variety of meats/seafood or something veggie in a couple different preparations. Flip side, I don't eat beef and he loves it. If he wants to go to a steakhouse, he makes sure they have quality non-beef options. \n\nIf a *specific restaurant* doesn't meet the other's needs, then we go with friends/family. Example: I'm out of town soon, and his birthday is coming up, so his cousins are taking him to a steakhouse they enjoy that serves nothing but steak and fries, while I'm out of town, as an early birthday.

I have personally never been to nor heard of one that forces you to pay $10 to sit there(I was just at a hibachi place last week, my friend came late, she did not eat or drink anything and they didn't care.)
