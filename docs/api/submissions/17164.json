I\u2019m feeling a bit guilty now.", "selftext": "For context my wife\u2019s birthday was a few days ago, I took her out last weekend somewhere nice for just me and her to have lunch and I took her out and did a whole walk/hiking day which is her favorite thing to do. This weekend her parents wanted to take her out to dinner, wherever she wanted to go. She asked my opinion on it, and I simply answered \u201cliterally anywhere except shoguns is fine\u201d. She knows I don\u2019t like the restaurant, I just don\u2019t like the flavors. Her dad loves the place so we\u2019ve been there often, every single time I have not liked it, so I came to the conclusion I just would stop going there. Spending $30 on a plate of food I won\u2019t eat seems ridiculous. Cue todays events, we went out with her parents and our kids, had a nice day together. \n\nTime comes to decide where we\u2019re going for dinner, wife immediately says shoguns. I think \u201cokay, no big deal I\u2019ll just get a kids meal or something (chicken strips and fries)\u201d. I remind my wife on the way to the restaurant that I don\u2019t plan on eating anything off the menu, but I would be more than happy to sit with everyone, enjoy the company, and I will order the chicken strips. She\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy, all good. \n\nUntil we get to the restaurant that is. Turns out the kids meals are only for 10 and under, obviously I\u2019m way over that age limit, so I thought \u201cno big deal, I\u2019ll just relax and enjoy the company, then I\u2019ll grab some food when we leave\u201d. Oh no, according to shoguns policy you have to pay per person whether or not that person is eating. They wanted me to pay $10 to watch other people eat, when the kids meal would\u2019ve only cost $7. So I asked again if I could just get the kids meal then, they refused, so I told my wife I\u2019m not paying $10 to watch everyone else eat dinner, fuck that. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting outside in the car, my wife is mad at me, and my wife\u2019s parents I\u2019m sure are not thrilled as well. I guess I\u2019m just feeling guilty, so the real question here is AITA? Should I have paid the $10 to sit at the table and watch everyone eat food that I can\u2019t even stand the smell of?", "created_utc": 1684015634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gu7jh/aita_for_walking_out_of_the_restaurant_during_my/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, it was her birthday, and OP loves her and wanted her to have a wonderful meal. But two things can be true. She could have had a fabulous birthday meal without his having to go hungry and feel queasy from the smell. There was no reason why he had to suffer. There's literally no indication that she hates every other restaurant in town, or even that she doesn't have other favourites. She was just being incredibly thoughtless and selfish and chose the ONLY ONE that would make the entire experience shitty for him. That makes her an unequivocal AH.\n\nHOWEVER . . . you, OP, are also an AH for not using your big boy words and just reminding her when y'all were out and deciding on a restaurant what you had told her earlier, which she may have simply forgotten. \n\nAll you had to do, when she chose the restaurant, was open your mouth and say, \"Hey, sweetheart, I know you love that place but remember what I said earlier? There's never anything I can eat there, and the smell makes me kinda queasy for some reason. Maybe we could go somewhere else? That great Italian place you loved?\" Or something like that.

And what restaurant has chicken on the kids menu and nothing even close, like chicken kara age, on the regular menu?\n\nEven if we overlook that, $10 is nothing to pay to sit there with people on your wife's birthday. \n\nI really do feel bad for you, but gotta say you took a misstep here.", "NTA she asked your opinion, knows you don\u2019t like the restaurant and immediately chose it anyway.
