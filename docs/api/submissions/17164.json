I\u2019m feeling a bit guilty now.", "selftext": "For context my wife\u2019s birthday was a few days ago, I took her out last weekend somewhere nice for just me and her to have lunch and I took her out and did a whole walk/hiking day which is her favorite thing to do. This weekend her parents wanted to take her out to dinner, wherever she wanted to go. She asked my opinion on it, and I simply answered \u201cliterally anywhere except shoguns is fine\u201d. She knows I don\u2019t like the restaurant, I just don\u2019t like the flavors. Her dad loves the place so we\u2019ve been there often, every single time I have not liked it, so I came to the conclusion I just would stop going there. Spending $30 on a plate of food I won\u2019t eat seems ridiculous. Cue todays events, we went out with her parents and our kids, had a nice day together. \n\nTime comes to decide where we\u2019re going for dinner, wife and family says shoguns. I think \u201cokay, no big deal I\u2019ll just get a kids meal or something (chicken strips and fries)\u201d. I remind my wife on the way to the restaurant that I don\u2019t plan on eating anything off the menu, but I would be more than happy to sit with everyone, enjoy the company, and I will order the chicken strips. She\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy, all good. \n\nUntil we get to the restaurant that is. Turns out the kids meals are only for 10 and under, obviously I\u2019m way over that age limit, so I thought \u201cno big deal, I\u2019ll just relax and enjoy the company, then I\u2019ll grab some food when we leave\u201d. Oh no, according to shoguns policy you have to pay per person whether or not that person is eating. They wanted me to pay $10 to watch other people eat, when the kids meal would\u2019ve only cost $7. So I asked again if I could just get the kids meal then, they refused, my wife was getting upset over the $10 charge for me to just sit there, so I told my wife I\u2019m not paying $10 to watch everyone else eat dinner, fuck that. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting outside in the car, my wife is mad at me, and my wife\u2019s parents I\u2019m sure are not thrilled as well. I guess I\u2019m just feeling guilty, so the real question here is AITA? Should I have paid the $10 to sit at the table and watch everyone eat food that I can\u2019t even stand the smell of?", "created_utc": 1684015634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gu7jh/aita_for_walking_out_of_the_restaurant_during_my/", "score": 5280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's never anything I can eat there, and the smell makes me kinda queasy for some reason. Maybe we could go somewhere else? That great Italian place you loved?\" Or something like that.

And if his family decided we were going there anyway, I would expect him to get me out of it.\n\nLikewise, if the conversation were in reverse and he said, say, anywhere but Olive Garden, I would pick anywhere but Olive Garden, and if I received pushback from my family, I would advocate for my spouse, *because having him there is half of what makes the meal enjoyable*.\n\nYour wife failed you by either specifically choosing what you don't like, or by failing to advocate for you. Even if shoguns is her favorite restaurant in the whole entire world, that should've prompted a \"well I want to go there, would you rather stay home\" type conversation.\n\nYou're NTA. Healthy marriages are full of compromises. You didn't make it about you, you took a reasonable stand against being charged to *sit there*. Against your wishes being outright ignored. Against being denied chicken fingers?! Honestly. It would be a totally different story if she didn't ask, but she did, and regardless of who chose to ignore your preferences, you got overlooked, even though you're supposed to be her number one.\n\nI cannot stress it enough. Marriage is built on a foundation of compromise. NTA, NTA, NTA.\n\nEdit: some of y'all are crazyyy lol. When did people's views of relationships become so entitled? I just can't. It's mother's day and I have a family to celebrate with, so I won't be entertaining further questions on my (imo) totally reasonable opinion. If nothing else, my own spouse agrees with me, we are happily married, and will not be going to the racist diner or to olive garden to celebrate any of our events in the near future lollll.\n\nFor anyone who is still struggling to grasp the two, basic fundamental points I've made here (because, again, I will not be clarifying further):\n\n1. If she had not asked, I would vote he's TA. If she had communicated that she wanted to go to the restaurant, I would have voted he's TA. If she gave him an out that he did not take, you guessed it, TA. This is both about compromise and about advocacy. You gotta protect your partner. You guys act like not getting to go to a restaurant that your spouse doesn't like on your birthday is like shooting a puppy. We don't have any of this context. We can allllllll stop making assumptions.\n\n2. If my racist diner analogy bothers you-- and again, it is strictly because I really do like just about everything-- please plug in my husband's dislike for Olive Garden instead. It's the same situation, different restaurant, no political bias in any sort of way. (Although...

Your opinion is that person A should not choose a restaurant that person B does not like for their own birthday, but some people's opinion should be that person B should not make a big deal about the restaurant for the sake of person A's birthday.\n\nFor example, I also probably would not pick a restaurant that I know my SO doesn't like. However, on the flip side, I would not be that upset if my SO picked a restaurant that I didn't like. I'd know they picked it because they really want to go there, it's their birthday, and I'd figure something out. It's just a restaurant and it's just one dinner. I'd hope he would do the same for me.

And I\u2019m almost positive there were other things along the lines of appetizers that he could\u2019ve ordered.

THAT is either selfish asshole behavior or passive aggressive asshole behavior. Might be both.", "That's just silly. He didn't veto anything. She asked him, he said anywhere but there. \n\nVeto would be if she suggested it and he forced her not to go.", "Eh, but he was just making his (fairly reasonable) preference known.

Something tells me you are lying.", "But it seems a bit obtuse to not let him order it at all when 3 other adults did order meals", "There\u2019s no way it costs more than $5 to make a handful of fries with 3 chicken strips", "I think it\u2019s a stupid policy.  Customer wants to spend money, accommodate them. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s asking for crazy substitutions or off-the-menu items.

Referring back to my own example, my husband knows I hate this specific diner and will avoid it at any cost. We wind up going there anyway for various family events that we're given no say in, which is whatever, and if he really wanted to go there for his birthday, I'd absolutely suck it up. But if he asked me if there was anything I was in the mood for, or anything I wanted to avoid, and I specified that the only thing I didn't want was the shitty diner, and we went there *anyway* (especially without his having mentioned anything about it-- in that conversation or even later like \"you know, I was thinking about it and could just really go for a patty melt\" or whatever), I'd be feeling like my input had been intentionally disregarded.\n\nAnd yeah, to be honest, the $10 would put me overboard.

If she hadn't had asked, my opinion would be totally different. Why bother asking if you're not going to take your spouses input into consideration? Why bother discussing it if you're not willing to advocate for your partner (because, as another commenter suggested, I do think dad was the one pulling the strings here, and wife just didn't stand up for her husband)?

Sorry.", "There are fries on the menu. There are drinks and appetisers or even deserts to have a bite of something.", ">dude no matter what fucking day it is only a moron and a schmuck would pay to literally just sit at a restaurant.\n\nCool, now he gets to enjoy a fight with his wife where he's clearly wrong. Congrats on saving that $10 though.", "Remember that this is after he refused to eat any of their entrees or appetizers, and demanded a kids meal.

His post clearly says \"I told my wife I'm not paying $10\" and now after the fact he is trying to claim it was her that was \"freaking out\" over $10. Those are completely opposite things and his original statement that he was the one refusing to pay makes much more sense in the context of the entire story. I believe he is trying to twist the narrative by changing it to his wife.", "None of that is really relevant though, there was no reason to get upset over $10 and leave the restaurant during dinner.", "Or at least let him know she might still pick that place when he mentioned it.

He put her in a bad position and over nothing really, he hasn\u2019t enjoyed it recently and doesn\u2019t want to pay for food that\u2019s not great. That\u2019s not a good reason to boycott your FIL\u2019s favorite restaurant when the in-laws take her out for a birthday dinner.

He chose to throw a temper tantrum after he agreed to go. Eating from a kids menu isn\u2019t reasonable and neither is paying $10 to stay but honestly suck it up and order an a la carte or side item or pay the $10 because for however many times they have been there they both neglected to look up the menu beforehand. I\u2019ve never heard of this $10 minimum and wonder why he didn\u2019t just order like two alcoholic beverages and plan to eat when he got back home.

There are limited seats and they do combine groups so he'd be taking up a space they could give to a paying customer. It's not like a regular table where the whole table is yours whether you have 1 person or 4. Because of that, I think it does make sense that you do need to buy something.", ">he did literally everything he could to be flexible and accommodating except paying an outrageous fee to just exist inside their walls lol wtf are you on??\n\nSo he didn't do literally everything he could.\n\nA whole big ordeal was caused over $10, or basically nothing.", "Just because it's her birthday doesn't mean she should completely disregard her partner's feelings. That's spoiled brat behavior. If she was dead set on Shoguns, she should have just told OP beforehand.

Yeah, I don't like it, but the reason I don't like it important. It actively engages me gag reflex, involuntarily. If I was forced to eat one of the many, many foods that I am picky about, you'd see me at the table gagging repeatedly or trying my best not to gag which will inevitably come out as one huge, exaggerated, gag. Not every food I don't like does this to me, but it's enough to trigger a very emotional response where I literally start feeling like I'm going to start sobbing if I have to eat it.\n\nI'm not \"incapable\" of eating that in the literal sense of the word, but I am \"incapable\" of eating those things in the practical sense.\n\nI *hate* it when people say \"you're an adult, just suck it up and eat it, geez\". I know I'm picky. I know it's ridiculous. I'm aware. But it's also not as easy as you're making it out to be to suck it up (which is what your comment appears to imply OP can do).\n\nMy opinion: NTA.

Setting aside OP's issue for a moment, can I just offer a little bit of unsolicited Chinese food related advice? When my husband and I started dating, I wasn't super keen on Italian, and he'd only tried sushi on our first date (which... I didn't know until our relationship was well underway, LOL). What we wound up doing, then, was we would have a take out night where he would place the orders and I would pick up his chicken parm from the Italian place, then pick up my sushi from the sushi place, spend about $25 total back when food was still reasonably priced, both get our favorites and neither have to eat something we hate. Sometimes compromise is cutting something one of you likes and one of you hates out, sometimes compromise is meeting in the middle, but it can also be you do your thing, I do mine, together.\n\nSorry - I know it's off topic and unsolicited, but given that Chinese is often takeout, unless you live a far way from food options, or unless transport is a challenge, idk why you both can't be happy. Unless it's a non-issue, in which case, don't mind me :)\n\nAnd - again - I have mentioned this quite a few times. It would be one thing if she hadn't asked for his input.

You don't *have* to do everything together as a couple. She could go out with her parents. They already celebrated her birthday as a couple.

Sure, but it's her birthday. It's her dads favorite place. She no doubt likes the place herself. So for me it's totally justifiable that she picked it. It's not like OP has some crazy food allergy and literally cannot eat there, he just doesn't like it. \n\nYou talk about compromise being vital, but I don't see OP making any compromise whatsoever.

I view that as my compromise in our marriage, at least as far as eating out goes. I also wouldn't want to embarrass my husband or ruin his birthday by causing a scene over food.\n\nThat being said, if I were picking the restaurant, I absolutely would try to choose something that my husband enjoys since him having a good time is important to me. If my family really insisted on a place he hated and I couldn't get them to change it, I'd do as the comment above mentioned and ask if he wanted to sit the celebration with my family out. So maybe she sucks a little but for me and the way my marriage works, the husband's reaction would be over the top. I guess every couple and every extended family has different dynamics though. Thanks for posting this comment, it was the first one I read that helped me see what the N T A verdicts might have been thinking.\n\nEdit: Changed Y T A to N T A, didn't say what I meant the first time lol", "Yeah that comment you stole nailed it, NTA at all.", "Ahh, then NTA. I thought her parents would be paying.", "Yeah it makes no sense - apparently they've been there often, what does he normally order then?", "He wanted the kids pricing, specifically off the kids meal. If this wasn't his wife's birthday I'd say no assholes but it's one day a year. Suck it up. You're going to sit in the car for your wife's bday celebration?", "Because none of this happened.", "If it\u2019s a hibachi place which it sounds like then OP YTA - you could\u2019ve orders plain rice and some grilled chicken or grilled veggies and asked for no glaze.", "I can dig that, but why they didn't just throw five more tenders and a handful of fries together and upcharge for an adult meal is beyond me. It sounds like OP would have tolerated that.", "I agree with you. I'm confused on why people are acting like this veto with such a big deal. He literally said any place but this one. It was one place. It's not like he vetoed 1/3 of the restaurants in their town.", "100% this. I wouldn't choose a restaurant my husband hates, it seems so disrespectful", "I mean reading the story, he put in a decent effort to make it \"fine.\" I'm curious how much you expect people in your life to bend over backwards to appease your desires when external factors keep pelting them in the face.", "Don't bother with them. You're talking to people who are completely incapable of understanding hypothetical situations that might differ from the current problem but might illicit the same emotional response.", "[This video?](https://youtu.be/bzDlS6JPUtE) Billy on the Street!", "Shoguns here is a hibachi grill, and seats at the grill where the chef cooks everything in front of you are pretty coveted.  If OP is sitting there not eating, then from this specific type of restaurant's view he's taking up a paying customer's spot.   As opposed to them sitting in a booth or regular table where each chair isn't necessarily bringing in a higher income as the hibachi grill seats would.   \n\nI get it, but surely there was a compromise somewhere there instead of \"give us $10 for nothing\".  My little cousin was a picky eater growing up.  Her mom and I are about the same age and we'd take the kids to eat.  Cousin and her mom (dad is my uncle, mom is not actually related to me.  Overlapping generations here! lol) would share a plate and they'd charge her $10 to do that.  I'm fairly certain it's listed somewhere on the menu", "My understanding is most restaurants make a loss of the kid menu so an adult asking for one of those meals is frowned on. \n\nBut a quick google of the menu shows you can get grilled chicken, or steak, or a chicken salad. Sounds like OP just didn't want to spend the money or was determined to make a point.", "The kids version is not always just a smaller adult version though. A lot of places season the kids meal way different from the adult versions.", "it seems he was expecting the meal for the seven dollar kids price", "> There\u2019s literally only one (beef and noodles) dish on their menu that I like\n\nBut there is one thing you can eat. That's not the same as OPs situation where OP said he can't stand anything on the menu.", "If the situation was that Shoguns was his wife's favorite restaurant, but they never go there because he doesn't like it, then your comment would be relevant and he'd be the AH. Yes, he should then suck it up as a \"treat\" for her birthday.\n\nBut that's not what OP said. It's not his wife's favorite restaurant, it's her father's. And they eat there all the time. OP is NTA.", "But he has already been told the one thing on the menu he can eat, he isn't allowed, so this isn't sucking up something he isn't in the mood for, it is being told to eat something he doesn't like or pay to sit and listen to his stomach growl. That isn't the same thing at all. And BTW, insisting an adult tries something that makes their skin crawl at just the thought of it is not a strong move on the fianc\u00e9's part, this is not the uplifting anecdote about love that you think it is. I like sushi, my husband does not. I also like a whole ton of other cuisines that he DOES like. So guess which ONE SINGLE cuisine I DON'T choose when we are going out, because for my birthday I would rather enjoy a meal I still thoroughly enjoy despite it not being sushi,  knowing the one I love is also having a good time WITH me?", "A lot of restaurants here have started to offer senior portions, which is roughly 2/3rd the size and price.", "Was gonna say this. I run a restaurant and we lose money on kids meals. Kids meals are an amenity so adults can come and enjoy themselves, even when they don't have a sitter. At the same time, at my restaurant, if you're there w a group who is eating and you don't want to eat, we don't charge you. Also, can't believe they wouldn't let him at least drink his $10, or offer to put the $10 on a giftcard for their next visit. There are many ways this could have been handled.", "nobody is specifically angry at the waiter here, its a shitty restaurant policy and so the restaurant is shitty. i would agree with you if people were mad at jimmy the waiter whos paid 3 bucks an hour but nobody is, ive seen many \"fuck that restaurant\" but 0 \"fuck that waiter\"", "He said that they have been there a lot, and that's how he knows that he doesn't like their food.  He tried to be obliging - I think that being told to pay $10 to not eat, with no attempt on the restaurant's part to accommodate him (like giving him a larger version of the kids' meal) was too much, on top of being dragged to a restaurant that he had said that he didn't want to go to, after his wife asked him.", "Wait...didn't the church feed you? I heard salt lake has a few Christians.  Source I'm ex Mormon that has since escaped the cult.", "Yeah, I very much feel like they tried to accommodate him and he refused because the kids menu was only $7. People talking about throwing away money are probably ignoring that.", "Presumably OP is against shogun's because it's a Japanese restaurant though. Which is fine, he doesn't have to like Japanese food, but I do think he's being a bit extreme vetoing an entire restaurant when there are plenty of ways to make the food 'acceptable.' like surely he could just have chicken katsu without the katsu sauce. If you're a grown adult who can't stomach rice and breaded chicken, I think you have bigge problems.", ">I run a restaurant and we lose money on kids meals.\n\nCan you tell /u/RoastedBeetneck for me?", "You just restated the same scenario and no, sorry, I'm mature enough to hold my temper in public at a restaurant during dinner. I can't imagine \"snapping\" to the point where I would do that. I would be upset and frustrated but I would just talk to my SO about how I felt afterwards like an adult. If I was *that* heated about it in the moment, I might step away to the bathroom or outside for a moment to breathe, but not go sit in the car for 1-2 hours to make a point.", "Interesting!", "There are no other restaurants in town that she and her parents like?   That's being a lot more difficult that not wanting to go to a single place.   Surely they also go out to eat at times when he isn't there.  It's not like he forbade them to eat seafood, he just wanted them not to go to one place that he didn't like.", "So get a fucking drink.  The specialty drinks are $10.95. Or, if he didn't want alcohol, get a mango colada smoothie and say \"And I'll want a bowl of rainbow sherbet for dessert\" and BAM, he's over $10.", "No idea. This was easily 30 years ago at this point. If you're familiar with Salt Lake, it was on N Temple just west of I-15 and was demolished along with apparently the bowling alley across the street from the All-Star motel. It had a big ass Conestoga wagon out front and a western decor.\n\nImage for reference: https://imgur.com/I6diXW1", "The church has \"storehouses\" which are basically grocery stores but instead of money you \"pay\" by going to church and helping set up before/clean up after, which you probably know as an ex-mo but putting here for others that might not know. They were actually incredibly useful for my family when I was a kid whenever dad could keep an apartment. Unfortunately, weekly motels don't have kitchens or even kitchenettes. There was one bed for dad and stepmom, one bed for me and my sister, and a TV and bathroom.", "Then I commend you for your self control, it's a great quality to have. But not everyone has as much self control as you or the tools to see they're getting upset and cool off quickly.\n\nBut the most important thing is theres so many points where his SO and inlaws could have avoided this.\n\nThey could have respected his decisions and picked literally anywhere else.\n\nThey could have offered to pay the 10 dollars.\n\nThey could have asked to speak to the manager and complained about the stupid rules.\n\nThey could have found out about these rules during the reservation and warned him.\n\nThey could have looked at the menu before hand and suggested the fries.\n\nThis is one person getting insulted over and over again and finally getting fed up whilst his partner and her parents did nothing to help.", "Haha, I guess not *shrug*  I was just speculating what the wife's decision process could have been. It wouldn't have been my choice to go to the one place my husband said he didn't want but I'm a doormat lol. In my circles, we always just let the birthday person pick where to go even if not everyone likes it, so I didn't feel like her decision was totally unfair.  I'm a pretty accommodating person in general, so I know my reaction would have been 'oh well, I'll just get a small side/drink/eat at home so they can go to the place they really want. It's one meal, so no biggie'. So the husband's response felt like an overreaction to me. He said in some comments later that there was stuff he could have eaten at that restaurant but he didn't realize it at the time so better planning would have really saved the night (like them looking at the menu together and finding something he could have). It sounded like he got frustrated at the restaurant choice and kind of shut down from there. But maybe that's because he felt like the decision was sprung on him with little warning? I don't know, that's why I like AITA, always new things to learn about how people think.", "How do you not think of the most obvious second option", "NTA. You were pretty much prepared to compromise every step of the way. Don't feel guilty.", "Of course OP was allowed to order an appetizer. He just wanted to prove a point and be a diva.\nOP is not the first person who has to go to a restaurant with limited or no options for their taste. Most people are just cool with ordering something basic, because you are not there for the food, but for the company.", "She should be angry at the restaurant\u2019s stupid policy.", "That is so so dumb hahaha. Asking someone for an opinion just to pick the one thing they say not to go is toxic. It shows complete disrespect to your partner.\n\n\nSitting there pretending you wouldn't be pissed if your partner asked for your opinion on something and you replied 'honestly I don't mind aslong as it's not this one specific thing'... Only for them to turn around and pick that exact thing out of the dozens of options.\n\n\n\nIt's disrespectful and controlling and my godddd if the genders where the other way round this thread would be very different.", "Exactly this, FreshlyFistedDogAnus.", "his suggestion was every other restaurant what are you talking about", "not really.\n\nit\u2019s a way for them to not have to charge kids wayy more.\n\neveryone knows many adults would be fine with smaller portions.\n\nbut food margins are slim enough that kids meals are usually 0 profit. they only exist so that adults will come to the restaurant who have kids and not think they have to spend 30 bucks for a 7 year old.\n\nthere\u2019s no benefit to a restaurant to allow adults to eat kids meals. they lose a table, have to do more work, and make no money.\n\nthey\u2019d rather just refuse service", "Bullshit. Kid meals usually have insane markup prices. Frozen chicken nuggets and fries are almost free if you are buying wholesale.", "Not at hibachi. It's a cook at the table style restaurant. If you don't like stir-fry of whatever style the Shogun brand does there's nothing for you as an adult. \n\nI'm the person who requested it for special occasions. We had to leave my grandmother at home.", "And also, just be an adult and eat something you don't like for the night lol", "asking an opinion or for suggestions doesn\u2019t mean getting to veto something. it\u2019s not his birthday", "I came to the same (YTA) conclusion. If my GF sat in the car during my birthday diner over some weak bullshit like that, I'd be fucking pissed off.", "Thanks for sharing the menu. Wtf OP. You could have had fries, a cocktail, and a dessert. And that would have been enough to let your wife enjoy her birthday meal. \n\nYes she was quite selfish to choose the one place you vetoed but once you were there, you could\u2019ve been the bigger person and not ruined the whole evening for her and everyone else.", "NTA - I was wondering - if he'd asked for two kid's meals, would they have done that.\n\nHe got my sympathy when he said that they go there a lot.  I had a friend I used to get dinner with, and he liked to choose the place, which was usually o.k. with me.   He ate at every restaurant in town, but for a while, he always wanted to eat at a restaurant that I don't particularly care for.  I finally out my foot down.  I didn't mind eating there occasionally, among other places, but every time, no, I was fed up.", "If this was from the other perspective, you would say the opposite.\n\nThis place is so stupid.", "but don't you think it's a bit weird to directly ask someone which restaurants they are ok with, and then blatantly choosing the one restaurant they hate without even a comment about how they hate it? i have never seen anything like this.", "Tempura chicken for the win", "You can literally look up menus online to work out what you can eat. I do it any time I go out", "It sounds more like OP sat with his arms crossed and refused to look at a menu.", "It's hibachi.  you're paying for the show and the food.  they take a loss on kids meals, so why would they want to have someone taking up a seat eating a kids meal when they could make a bunch more money with someone eating steak and other hibachi foods?", "Shogun is a crappy establishment so this policy doesn\u2019t surprise me.  This story is not fake.  \ud83d\ude44", "you're forgetting being charged just to sit there....there's a difference...the guy was okay with going to the place....just not paying $10 to sit there.", "Not really comparable. That\u2019s an entire type of food, OP just didn\u2019t want a specific restaurant. It would be like saying you don\u2019t like McDonalds but Wendy\u2019s or Burger King is ok vs saying you don\u2019t like hamburgers at all.", "Also it says their family go there often so it\u2019s presumably a go to family place with lots of memories for them. Seems unreasonable to never go there again because OP doesn\u2019t like it. Especially when joining with someone\u2019s family (as in marriage) you need to roll with the punches for some things.", "You see, he's a man, so he's just supposed to suck everything up\n\nBut if it were the wife forced to pay to sit in a place she loathes it would be an entirely different story, starting with emotional abuse, gaslighting...", ">If it was FIL's birthday I could understand it\n\nYeah, this is really the key point IMO.  I'm usually on team \"Just be a grown-up and eat the damn food,\" but in this case, it sounds like the wife didn't even particularly want this and it was her birthday.", "The kids menu is for children,  it is a loss leader.   The restaurant doesnt make any money on it.   If you allowed adults to order off of it you would end up with  total nightmare customers every day.", "I mean did they offer him an adult portion? Or did they automatically assume chicken tenders are only for kids? I'm genuinely asking because I've been places where mac and cheese can only be ordered on the kids' menu; however, many of those places would allow adults to order off the kids' menu.", "Also, the husband literally tried to do this and\u2026 the restaurant didn\u2019t let him.", "Nobody said that they could never go there again.   I doubt that OP and his wife are the only people the parents ever go to a restaurant with.   They could even go . . . all by themselves, just the two of them.", "Ah okay, my bad then, thanks for clearing it up", ">I was under the impression that marrying a child was illegal.\n\nHoo boy do I have some bad news for you.", "Ooh! I ate at one of those once, I think! Spouse and I were super hungry and went into the only restaurant we could find in the area we'd been strolling. It had no windows and only 2 tables, and most of the restaurant was cut off from view by colorful curtains. The restaurant staff vanished after taking our order, and we felt a bit creeped out being left all alone in this cramped, windowless room for so long. Oh yeah, our food took so long to get to us that we legit wondered if they sent someone out to another restaurant to get it. I will give them this, it was very tasty!", "I can't imagine a toasted cheese sandwich is a loss. Even if they only receive one order, it has to be more than price of a loaf of bread and cheese?", "They said he could sit there for $10 and he and his wife got pissed. This guy sounds childish as hell to me.", "I would like to know if anyone thought to offer $3 (or however much) to add like two extra chicken tenders. OP would have palatable food, the restaurant would receive money for the seat, and the performing cook would have minimal extra work.", "This reminds of of the AITA where the grandparents wanted to treat two kids for a job well done and they chose a seafood restaurant, which the younger kid had vetod because the fish smell makes her nauseous.", "Looka at the most common cross-sub traffic. And you'll see why", "Yup, I think it\u2019s completely plausible that her parents didn\u2019t know because OP doesn\u2019t want to impact her parents\u2019 enjoyment of the restaurant by saying how much he dislikes it. It feels like the expectation was that his wife would direct the decision making without making his feelings explicit\u2026 But she either didn\u2019t do that effectively or her parents just said \u201cSo, Shoguns?\u201d and she felt railroaded without a legit reason to say no (other than the actual).\n\nIt sounds convoluted when you write it out, but in the real world people play these little games and tell each other little white lies / lies of omission to spare feelings ALL THE FUCKING TIME.
