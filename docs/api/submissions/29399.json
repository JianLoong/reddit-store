{"id": 29399, "submission_id": "17ddg3a", "title": "AITA for accusing my aunt of exploiting my mother's grief over her dead son?", "selftext": "I'm 16 and caught up in a family situation that's pretty complicated. Due to problems at home, I've been moving back and forth between my dad's and my nan's places. My aunt, Alice, is 29, and she occasionally stays at my nan's. We have a bit of a rocky relationship because she's not exactly cozy with my mom. \n\nA couple of years ago, my mom had a baby named Charlie, who, unfortunately, passed away on   \nthe same day.  Even though we couldn't bring Charlie home, he's a significant part of our family. We celebrate his birthday, and there's a little memorial for him in our front room.\n\nNow, things get messier. Alice got pregnant a year later, and she and my uncle approached my mom. Alice admitted she liked the name Charlie but felt uneasy about her son sharing the name with a \"dead kid.\" My mom got really upset and said, \"He's not just a 'dead kid,' he's your nephew.\" After a two-month showdown, Alice gave in and picked a different name to avoid any more arguments over the baby name..\n\nHere\u2019s where I may be TA. A few days ago, I noticed Alice was selling these resin baby figurines for Baby Loss Awareness Month. She tagged my mom in the comments, which pissed me off a bit as not even the day prior ( C\u2019s bday ) she told me my mum was lying about grieving Charlie for pity points.\n\nThat night I was at nans, and Alice suggested I buy one for my mom to put next to the \u201cshrine of her dead kid\u201d, and I just got really upset. I called her out, and said she was profiting off other people's pain and choosing to believe my mum only when it made her money.  I also reminded her that if she wanted to be part of our family, she should at least use Charlie's name and show some empathy.\n\nAlice argued she couldn't understand what my mom went through because she hadn't lost a baby herself. I told her she shouldn't pretend to get it while talking negatively about my mom behind her back. I also said that if she really cared about people who've suffered like that, she should donate to charities that help grieving families instead of pocketing the money. She brushed it off, saying money doesn't help with healing. I lashed out and called her a shallow bitch.\n\nOur argument got pretty intense, and my nan had to send me to bed. Now, Alice wants me banned from my nan's place, saying my \"presence is causing emotional distress to her and her baby boy.\" My school advised against staying at my mom's, so I'm not sure if my nan will ask me to leave on the days I'm supposed to be with her. So, am I the one in the wrong here (AITA)?", "created_utc": 1697925074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ddg3a/aita_for_accusing_my_aunt_of_exploiting_my/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You lost a brother, too, which your aunt is conveniently forgetting (of course). I am truly sorry for your loss and the pain you feel.\n\nI think what you should do is approach your nan before Alice can sob to her, and speak to your nan honestly and in a mature manner about all that has occurred. Make sure you bring up what your school said, and that being allowed to stay at your nan\u2019s place is beneficial to you (as long as that is what you want, vs being at your dad\u2019s full-time.) \n\nI\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through, on all levels. Your aunt is a horrid person. No one gets to dictate someone else\u2019s grief or how long they can grieve. And no one should be profiting off of someone else\u2019s grief. That\u2019s just evil.\n\nHang in there <3", "NTA.\n\nIt's true that the pain of losing a child is hard to explain, but that doesn't mean you can't still feel empathy for someone's loss. The fact that Alice keeps referring to her nephew as \"the dead kid\" is absolutely horrible. I also agree that she seems to be trying to profit from other people's losses. If she donated the money she got, that would be one thing, but that's clearly not what she's doing, based on your post.\n\nIf your \"presence is causing emotional distress\", then she should be able to understand why calling her nephew \"the dead kid\" is also distressing to you and your mother.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have lost a child yourself to be empathetic, you will never understand the pain and hurt of course, but understanding, listening, there is a lot you can try do for somebody who is processing their grief\n\nThe way your auntie talks of your mother and the loss of your brother , is frankly disrespectful consistently referring to him as a \u201cdead child\u201d is harsh, there are many ways she can support baby loss awareness month, starting with those around her and those calling out for support. Not by selling off resin products for financial gain", "NTA Seems like you were being supportive of your mother, and I really hope you can stay at your nan's. What a difficult situation", "NTA\n\nYour aunt sounds horrible and cold-hearted. Go to your nan and explain all that's going on and how you didn't react kindly to how your aunt was talking about your mom's grief for YOUR LITTLE BROTHER. Not just some \"dead kid.\"", "NTA. I can't imagine acting like this about someone's loss. Like, even if it was someone they hated, they lost their freaking child", "NTA\n\nYour aunt sounds spoiled and toxic. Your mom isn't the only one grieving this terrible loss, you are too. Your aunt is out of line and sounds awful and materialistic.* \n\nIt is up to the adults to work out where you are staying (even though you're almost an adult yourself, I know). I hope your grandmother would talk any changes over with your parents and not just suddenly say you can't stay there. This is not something you should have to worry about and I'm sorry they aren't doing a better job protecting and sheltering you. Worst case, is there is a friend or other relative(s) you could stay with on those nights, until things calm down (your aunt will still be awful, but the confrontation can die down)? It might feel better to line up an option or two, just so you know you have a backup plan. I hope things even out so that this isn't weighing on you. \n\n*It's unfortunate that your aunt is pocketing all the money, and she should **never** have been cruel enough to tag your mom, but sometimes those tchocthkes can be comforting. After my 2nd miscarriage a remembrance bracelet with the baby's birthstone and the birthstone of the month I lost them, was really important for a good while and helped me recover when I was stuck in grief (the baby had been due on Father's Day, which was also my wedding anniversary that year, and it was a harder loss for that).", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
