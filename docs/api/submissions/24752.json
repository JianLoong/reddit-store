His wife (25F) was previously married and has a daughter (5F). When they were dating I spent my summer babysitting for them and getting paid 20 dollars a day. I had zero problems with this until recently. They had their son in October 2022 and ever since I have been attached to my nephew. They also had a modular home put in the backfield so they were closer to us. I was back in school so I wasn't babysitting anymore. When summer rolled around again I started working my first job and offered to babysit occasionally when I didn't have a shift and they didn't have to pay me. Eventually, I started to only work 2-3 days a week and they knew my schedule. Every day I was not working they would come by the House and drop their kids off. I started to voice that I wanted to be paid again if I was going to be babysitting so often. They never paid me and kept dropping their kids off. These last few weeks I have been busy getting ready for school to start and going out of town a lot. They had voiced that they were mad I wasn't there to babysit for them. Last week was a week where I was able to be home after I had decided to quit my job for the school year. They came in with only my nephew on Friday night and asked me to babysit while they quickly ran to her parent's home and claimed it would only take 30 minutes or less. When they came back, they never came in for my nephew but were making it obvious they were home. They were running around the yard screaming. After about 2 hours of having him, it was his bedtime and I started to take him to his house since I knew they were home. While I was walking toward the house I started to see their truck pulling out of the house until they saw me. I gave them the baby and decided I didn't care until my mom texted me that they said they were going to take her daughter to the fair for a few hours without having to deal with the baby.  I finally got the nerve to tell my SIL Im tired of being more of a mother to him than she is and that I shouldn't be expected to be at their Beck and call. She hasn't spoken to me since and some people say I'm being too harsh while others say I'm being completely reasonable.\n\nI also want to mention that they always say it won't take long and it either ends up being a situation where he falls asleep for the night and stays with me or it takes multiple hours and they always claim that they just end up talking.

Even if they make some kind of schedule parents like this will always find a way to work around it, like continuous \u201cemergencies\u201d or just dumping the kids in the house and taking off.", "I think you need to remind them you\u2019re a kid too. I am honestly impressed with your patience. If I was 15 I would get bored after 5 minutes of babysitting.", " Whenever I babysit my bottom rate is \u00a35 per kid per hour. Normally I babysit a brother and sister so it\u2019s 10 an hour. It\u2019s best to charge hourly because it discourages being late. However make  sure they are aware that you charge a certain amount every 15 minutes they are late. \n\nWhat they have been doing is beyond babysitting. They are Manipulating you and forcing you to look after their kid with false promises and lies. \n\nYou should stop doing any kind of childcare for them, at least for a while. They are using you and it\u2019s time they get off their asses and actually be parents to their kids that they chose to have. \n\nYou don\u2019t even have to give a reason to them. Just say \u2018no\u2019 and that\u2019s all you need. If they try to pull a fast one and leave the kids with you make them clear that if such event was to occur the authorities will be called for child abandonment. \n\nYou are a person and deserve to be treated as such. NTA", "INFO. Why were they running around their yard screaming, do they have substance abuse or mental health problems?", "You were not included in their decision to procreate.  Instead of being entitled to your babysitting, they should be grateful and not take advantage of you.  NTA, set boundaries they are two grown-A adults who decided to being a baby into this life, they can be parents.", "NTA. They are blessed that you already willingly do so much.", "Their kids aren't your responsibility, NTA.\n\nSome friendly advice, since you and my wife are similar. If you don't set boundaries for yourself situations like this will come up often and ruin many of your relationships. You voiced that you wanted to be payed for your time, probably many times, and they ignored you. You set a boundary for yourself, did nothing when it was ignored, and then became angry when you'd had enough. This cycle will repeat itself until you learn to set and respect your own boundaries.", "NTA: your SIL is being unreasonable and you shouldn't have to take care of someone else's kids when you have your own responsibilities.", "NTA\n\nI love when adults think kids have summer so that means they\u2019re \u201cnot doing anything\u201d and they can dump all over them.\n\nI would not babysit, even for money. At least for a while. They need to learn that they can\u2019t just dump their kids on you without a PLANNED NOTICE. Something like 48 hours.", "NTA stop babysitting unless they pay you for time and pick the kids up when expected. You deserve to have e a social life and to be paid for your work- you are not a teen mom.", "NTA Do not babysit ever again.  These people are users and will continue until you stand firm and say not happening anymore. their children their problem.  You are 15 you should be with friends and enjoying your teen years not stuck babysitting.  Tell them RAISE your own children.  Good luck", "NTA \n\ntell them you are not free, you've helped them out and they exploited your generosity but that is over.  if they just drop the child off again you will call CPS .\n\nsounds like they need to be investigated anyway.", "NTA\n\nThis happens all the time! Not your kid, not your problem. They\u2019re adult enough to pop a few out - they\u2019re adult enough to take care of them on their own. FFS you have your own life. \n\nIf anyone is bothering you about it, ask them why they won\u2019t help. If it\u2019s such a huge deal, then everyone else in the family should step up. If they\u2019re not, then they need to STFU", "NTA. Since these family members deliberately exploit you, intentionally refusing to ever negotiate or operate in good faith, it\u2019s your job to permanently decline to help. That\u2019s the price they pay for being untrustworthy and con artists. If you want that connection with the niblings, just stick to normal interactions at family gatherings where they can\u2019t be pawned off on you and enjoy your life. Because it is your life and you didn\u2019t sign up for their maltreatment or their children to raise.", "NTA. Do not babysit for them anymore, at all. If you want to spend time with the kids do it on your own terms, not when they ask. Get a real babysitting gig where you get paid.", "NTA. Your brother and sister in law are taking you for granted and treating you with extreme disrespect. They deserve to be publicly shamed for their entitled behaviour.", "NTA send them an invoice for the summer and stop talking to them til they've paid you, yessh", "NTA\u2026and did you mean mobile home or modular?  I\u2019m guessing double wide trailer\u2026LOL!", "Hell no NTA, only way they\u2019ll learn is if you stop altogether, though.", "NTA, but you should find out who her father is and use that as leverage- some parents keep kids to avoid paying child support. If her dad finds out she's not receiving care from her mom, he might fix the problem.", "Give them an inch .......   and they will take a mile.   I wouldn't baby sit these kids at all - AT ALL anymore.   They were so clearly taking advantage of you that it warrants a shut down of your services.. paid or not.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA a hundred times over.", "NTA- You weren't the one too irresponsible to avoid getting pregnant. This is their problem and it should ahve nothing to do with you.", "Definitely NTA. Make sure you are firm in your decision when watching them. It sounds like they are pawning off their kids so they can go have fun. \n\nThere are a few things you need to do. \n\n1. Demand pay and make sure it's fair for you. You're caring for 1 - 2 kids for hours at a time. Even though they are your niece and nephew, you still deserve to be paid for your time \n2. Like others suggested tell them you charge a late fee to give them incentive to come back on time\n3. Have them pay you the agreed amount before you babysit\n4. If they refuse or try to take off and leave the kids with you, it sounds extreme, but sometimes only extreme measures work. Threaten to call for child abandonment\n5. If your parents get upset, tell them to babysit for free as much as you have been.", "NTA focus on school and going to college. Don\u2019t ever babysit for them again since they will take it as green light got them to revert back to their old ways.", "The \"more of a mother to him than you are\" sounds kind of harsh. But you're NTA for not wanting to babysit. You're 15, in school, and not a mother. You didn't have a kid and you don't have to live like you have a kid.", "And....  You will not babysit again unless and until you are paid in full.", "And send it via text so you have proof. They won\u2019t be able to claim, \u201cWe didn\u2019t agree to that.\u201d", "And no babysitting until they pay for the first session of babysitting.  Also tell them you need 24 hours notice before you'll do any babysitting.  If you give them any rules, you have to be super strict in enforcing the rules or they'll just go back to old habits.\nWhy isn't your mom babysitting?", "Give them a written list of your fees (including late fees) and have them sign at the bottom befor letting them leave any kid with you.  \nAlso, ususlly we are charging more for a baby (diappers and constant watching) than for a 5yo, and charging more for 2 kids than just one. Charging more on week nights (you have school) and/or extras on saturda nights if you generally would like your saturday nights off for social life.", "Even if OP got the pay she wanted it would only be for a short while. Then the excuses of \u201cwe are short of funds this week\u201d will become a frequent excuse not to pay her.", "If they're struggling for money, why are they going out? You don't have to give any excuses or reasons at all, just refuse. As everyone says around here, \"No.\" is a complete sentence.", "[removed]", "Honestly, I'd make a contract. It might not be legally binding, but I'd make it look as official as possible. Hell, tell them you won't babysit unless they sign your contract in front of a notary at the bank. And make your hourly rate better than your job. Your time is valuable. I'd make your *late* fee 20 bucks every fifteen minutes. \n\nBecause *your time is valuable*. They need to respect that, and respect you, or they should raise their own kids.", ">Ask around at school to see what other kids are making to babysit.\n\nWhat ever the highest rate is add on atleast 15% as a \"family tax\" because we all know to never mix business with family unless the headaches benefit you financially.", "Get a proper job where you're paid regularly and a fixed amount that you can rely on.", "I made $1.50 an hour ten years ago as my mom's favor to her friends with many children. Don't let your parents pressure you into doing things you don't want to do for bs pay.", "That made them feel like it's normal for you to take care of their kids, made them feel entitled to it.", "My parents voluntold me to babysit for their friends for free as my 'service hours' for my Confirmation ... So instead of volunteering somewhere that I could put on my college applications I was babysitting."]}
