His wife (25F) was previously married and has a daughter (5F). When they were dating I spent my summer babysitting for them and getting paid 20 dollars a day. I had zero problems with this until recently. They had their son in October 2022 and ever since I have been attached to my nephew. They also had a modular home put in the backfield so they were closer to us. I was back in school so I wasn't babysitting anymore. When summer rolled around again I started working my first job and offered to babysit occasionally when I didn't have a shift and they didn't have to pay me. Eventually, I started to only work 2-3 days a week and they knew my schedule. Every day I was not working they would come by the House and drop their kids off. I started to voice that I wanted to be paid again if I was going to be babysitting so often. They never paid me and kept dropping their kids off. These last few weeks I have been busy getting ready for school to start and going out of town a lot. They had voiced that they were mad I wasn't there to babysit for them. Last week was a week where I was able to be home after I had decided to quit my job for the school year. They came in with only my nephew on Friday night and asked me to babysit while they quickly ran to her parent's home and claimed it would only take 30 minutes or less. When they came back, they never came in for my nephew but were making it obvious they were home. They were running around the yard screaming. After about 2 hours of having him, it was his bedtime and I started to take him to his house since I knew they were home. While I was walking toward the house I started to see their truck pulling out of the house until they saw me. I gave them the baby and decided I didn't care until my mom texted me that they said they were going to take her daughter to the fair for a few hours without having to deal with the baby.  I finally got the nerve to tell my SIL Im tired of being more of a mother to him than she is and that I shouldn't be expected to be at their Beck and call. She hasn't spoken to me since and some people say I'm being too harsh while others say I'm being completely reasonable.\n\nI also want to mention that they always say it won't take long and it either ends up being a situation where he falls asleep for the night and stays with me or it takes multiple hours and they always claim that they just end up talking.
