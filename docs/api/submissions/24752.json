{"id": 24752, "submission_id": "15sh7zj", "title": "AITA for telling my sister in law that I shouldnt be expected to be her kids other mother?", "selftext": "My (15F) brother (27M) got married in May 2021. His wife (25F) was previously married and has a daughter (5F). When they were dating I spent my summer babysitting for them and getting paid 20 dollars a day. I had zero problems with this until recently. They had their son in October 2022 and ever since I have been attached to my nephew. They also had a modular home put in the backfield so they were closer to us. I was back in school so I wasn't babysitting anymore. When summer rolled around again I started working my first job and offered to babysit occasionally when I didn't have a shift and they didn't have to pay me. Eventually, I started to only work 2-3 days a week and they knew my schedule. Every day I was not working they would come by the House and drop their kids off. I started to voice that I wanted to be paid again if I was going to be babysitting so often. They never paid me and kept dropping their kids off. These last few weeks I have been busy getting ready for school to start and going out of town a lot. They had voiced that they were mad I wasn't there to babysit for them. Last week was a week where I was able to be home after I had decided to quit my job for the school year. They came in with only my nephew on Friday night and asked me to babysit while they quickly ran to her parent's home and claimed it would only take 30 minutes or less. When they came back, they never came in for my nephew but were making it obvious they were home. They were running around the yard screaming. After about 2 hours of having him, it was his bedtime and I started to take him to his house since I knew they were home. While I was walking toward the house I started to see their truck pulling out of the house until they saw me. I gave them the baby and decided I didn't care until my mom texted me that they said they were going to take her daughter to the fair for a few hours without having to deal with the baby.  I finally got the nerve to tell my SIL Im tired of being more of a mother to him than she is and that I shouldn't be expected to be at their Beck and call. She hasn't spoken to me since and some people say I'm being too harsh while others say I'm being completely reasonable.\n\nI also want to mention that they always say it won't take long and it either ends up being a situation where he falls asleep for the night and stays with me or it takes multiple hours and they always claim that they just end up talking. My niece switches off with her dad every week and whenever she is back it seems like they dump her off to anyone that they can so they don't have to take care of her.", "created_utc": 1692165854, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15sh7zj/aita_for_telling_my_sister_in_law_that_i_shouldnt/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They took advantage of your kindness.", "NTA. this is so unfair on you, I'm sorry.", "NTA. You are being taken advantage of.", "Like everyone else has said, NTA\n\nYour SIL feels entitled to your time and has been breaking boundries left, right and centre. That's A H behaviour.  \n\nIf you weren't family and an independently hired babysitter, you would have grounds for a civil claim.\n\nIF you decide to babysit for them in future, state you want a contract written up (by an independent 3rd party) that they are legally obliged to adhere to. Otherwise they can pound sand. \n\nYour SIL wants a kid without the responsibility of looking after it. That won't fly.", "NOT YOUR KIDS NOT YOUR PROBLEM! You are 15", "If you choose to babysit make it clear you charge by the hour. (It gives them the incentive to be back on time.)  The clock starts the moment they put baby in your arms. A late fee of five dollars per 15 minutes you babysit past pick up time.   Payment is due on the day you watched their baby. If they fail to pay you in full on the day of your service, stop babysitting for them.", "NTA. That role is only acceptable if you wholeheartedly wanted to be like a second mother to them. It's not a role that is forced on someone or it'll cause resentment on everyone involved.", "NTA Make it very clear they can only leave their kids with you after youve GIVEN YOUR CONSENT. That has to be a firm boundary you hold. If they just show up and try to drop the kid off you say No. Walk the fuck away if you have to, drop the kid off with your parents, make their sons behavior their problem. I'd have threatened to call CPS on them for abandonment at this point.", "NTA.\n\nThey are taking advantage of you. They are AHs. You are a kid. If they don't want to take care of children they shouldn't have had children. This is not your problem.", "NTA. It is absolutely unreasonable to expect you to be available to babysit for them whenever they want a break. I totally get it, two young children can be a lot of work, but it is THEIR work, not yours. It is really healthy to draw some firm boundaries with them. I think you should be proud of yourself for ebony unwilling to be Aunty Sitter.", "NTA. Your response was on point. How do your parents feel about you being a pseudo parent?", "NTA for all the reasons you list. They've been taking you for granted and abusing your time.", "NTA. They are taking advantage of you. They know you are cheap babysitting and want to milk you for every bit of time they can take you for.\n\nRefuse to babysit unless they pay you. It\u2019s the only way they\u2019ll leave you alone. You are a person separate from your relationship with them and they are not trying you like one AT ALL. \n\nIt\u2019s time for them to start acting like adults since they ARE the adults in this situation. Talk to your mom and see if you can get her on your side. If they truly are always dropping her daughter off instead of spending time with her, that\u2019s something he ex should know. She\u2019s not doing her job as a mother and it is not your job to pick up the slack. \n\nYou\u2019re still a kid. Do whatever you can to hold on to the last of your childhood.\n\nNTA at all and I hope you find a way to get yourself out of this unscathed. Hopefully your mom will help!", "NTA.  If they cannot look after their kids on their own or afford to properly pay a babysitter then they shouldn't have kids.  Well done for standing up for yourself.  DO NOT sacrifice your upcoming studies by being a free or underpaid babysitter.", "NTA. My parents and their friends did this to me as a teenager and I so regret not speaking up sooner. \n\nI babysat my little siblings as well as my parents\u2019 friends\u2019 kids literally every weekend. Not gonna lie, I was making pretty good money from it. But I was missing out on being a teenager\u2026 I never got to go out with my friends and spend that money on teenager things, like skating rinks and laser tag, etc. \n\nNot trying to make this about me, but you did the right thing.
