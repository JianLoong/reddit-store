About a year later my dad (54M) met his new girlfriend (41M) through an internet game. His new girlfriend already has two sons (14M & 17M) from a previous relationship and they live about 2 hours away from us. Until now we had a good relationship and hardly any problems. \n\nMy parents and I have always traveled a lot and my dad and I have been planning a trip to Rome since before covid. So far, unfortunately, something has always come up, but the trip exactly to Rome with my dad is very important to me. My boyfriend (20M) wanted to go with me, but I cancelled because the trip was already planned with my dad and it was so very important to me.  The last time I asked when we were going together was earlier this week. \n\nA few days ago I met with my dad and he told me in passing that he was flying to Rome with his girlfriend and their two sons, because the sons couldn't agree on any other destination.  (gf payed for herself and her sons, dad payed for himself and I would\u2019ve payed for myself) No one talked to me or thought about whether I might want to go. Of course I was a bit surprised and also very hurt that my dad uses the first chance to go to Rome, of all places, without me and also about the fact that I am the only one who does not come along. I told him so, whereupon he became angry and said I have a boyfriend at home so it does not matter that I am the only one who does not come. He also said that since I have already traveled more than his girlfriend and her children, we still have plenty of time to go to Rome. I told him that was not the point.  I said I don't know if I will forgive him so quickly if he makes especially this trip without me. We argued about it and it quickly escalated. He said I'm a shitty daughter and it's okay for him if we don't talk anymore just because I can't get over it. We are not talking right now. \n\nhis girlfriend messaged me and said she was sorry that I felt that way, but she really wanted him to come and how awful it would be for her to go without him. She thinks I am pressuring him to not go.  No one but me has tried to find a solution or listened to my point of view.  \n\nI think I am the asshole because I spoil the others so their vacation and they do not often go on vacation but I also do not understand why I am excluded.\n\nMy mom, my boyfriend, and some friends are on my side and say my dad and his girlfriend are showing favoritism towards girlfriends sons, but my dad and his family are all mad at me for ruining the vacation, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1688378586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14perxm/aita_for_ruining_a_family_vacation_that_i_am_left/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Its literally favoritism.\n\nAnd to tell you so close the date as well. Yikes.\n\nJust out of interest is it just that you want to visit Rome, or that it has to be with your Dad?", "\u201cDad, there will come a time when you wonder why we don\u2019t see each other often and why our relationship isn\u2019t what it once was. When that time comes, remember this. Remember that you decided your new gf and her children were more important than me and remember that you decided to choose them for a trip we had been planning for years. Remember that you decided your child didn\u2019t matter as much as your new gf. Because right now you made the decision that I don\u2019t matter, and I will move forward in life based upon your decision. Hope it\u2019s worth it to you.\u201d\n\nNTA.", "The Rome-trip has been in the planning by you and your father for years. Due to circumstances it got delayed, but you still want to go on that trip with your dad.\n\nYou refused going their with your boyfriend, as you wanted to discover that specific destination, as planned with your father. \n\nYou even discussed this with your father earlier this week. He didn't follow-up on your enquiries about planning the trip for real now. \n\nAnd next thing you know, he's going with his new family to THAT SPECIFIC DESTINATION. Excluding you.\n\nThey could have gone anywhere else, but opted for THAT SPECIFIC DESTINATION (can't underline it enough...).\n\nOf course you're pissed, hurt, dissapointed. You've basically been replaced....\n\nAnd if your feelings about their trip to that specific destination are ruining it for them, they should have thought about your feelings BEFORE choosing that destination. That's all on them.\n\nNTA", "Your father is the AH here.\n\nHe could have gone literally anywhere with her and chose that. And also chose not to invite you. You told him you were hurt and instead of listening and talkin g he said it was fine if you don't talk anymore. Frankly if that's his attitude the moment a new woman walks into his life you are better off with a bit of space from him. His behaviour is dreadful. NTA", "Nta sad he is incapable of keeping his promise. Start treating him as he treats you.", "NTA\n\nYour dad had a choice. He chose to go with them. He chose not to inform you despite knowing how important it was to the two of you. I don't think you spoiled this at all it was spoiled by your fathers initial decisions that led to this exact scenario.\n\nIf I shoot myself in the foot and blame you for not stopping me, when you had no idea what I was doing, who is really at fault?", "Nta. Op I think you may need to find a counselor because this behavior may escalate and it will compound the hurt. I hope he\u2019ll see the light gut yes this is favoritism and I suggest not engaging in arguments about trip as they\u2019re looking for a scape goat.", "NTA\n\nYour dad chose the destination you two had to postpone for his first vaccation with his new GF and her children. That's dismissive of your feelings regardless of your age and relationship status.\n\nHe dismissed your feelings and even turned them against you. \n\nIf his dismissive behaviour towards you is enough to spoil his vacation, that's HIS problem and caused by him, he knows he's acting shitty, not by you.\n\nYour BF and family are right, lean back, go LC and let things cool off. You'll see if your father realises that he messed up and wants to make it up to you, if he'l just try to act as if nothing happened or if he'll have you be the villian and you can save money because you can buy less bday and xmas gifts in the future.", "NTA - i\u2019m sorry but go with someone else your dad has clearly picked who he most values in his life his new gf and children.", "NTA, I can absolutely see why you'd be hurt. Your dad is an idiot because he can't see the you (and all of reddit) see that he completely forgot about you because his emotional and sex life is more important than his relationship with his daughter.\n\nYou say his GF lives a few hours away. Does that mean you live with him? Can you move in with your mom or get an apartment? Cuz that is what I would  do. If he dropped you out of something so important to you, you know where his priorities are. I would go vlc with him and let him have his new life, and start building your own.\n\nSorry this has happened to you, go enjoy Rome with your bf and mom!", "NTA, but how exactly did you ruin their vacation? You were denied a vacation that you were expecting and looking forward to and you were upset about it.\n\nWhat level of entitled does it take to be expected to not only not be upset about it but pretend that you weren't so that you could protect your father's mood for their vacation? WTF?", "Nta. Your dad is giving you a message. You aren't important anymore. What you do with that information is up to you.", "INFO Did the GF and sons also know that you had planned on going to Rome with your dad? \n\nThis smells like they knew exactly what they were doing when they insisted on only going to Rome\n\nOf all the places in the world, they choose the ONE place that you were planning. Fishy", "NTA \u2013 I don\u2019t necessarily think your dad was the asshole for planning a holiday with his girlfriend and her kids and not including you. You\u2019re 21, while his girlfriend\u2019s kids are still children, so I'd expect there to be some difference in the way that you\u2019re treated. It\u2019s possible that your dad is the asshole for that, but to judge that we really need to know more about your lives than AITA can tell us.\n\nAside from that, your dad was the asshole. He didn\u2019t give much thought to your previous plans to go to Rome together, and it sounds like he was nasty to you when you tried to speak to him about it. Once he realised you were upset, he could\u2019ve invited you, or at the very least been apologetic about the situation.\n\nI\u2019m curious: do you believe your dad that they are going to Rome because it was the only place his girlfriend\u2019s children could agree on?\n\n(Edit: Sorry, it was your dad's girlfriend, not a new wife, so I've edited for that)", "I'm leaning towards YTA here tbh. \n\nHim going to rome with his family doesn't mean you can't go with him another time, you've already said you've travelled a lot with your family and that his family haven't travelled so much, let him have a trip with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
