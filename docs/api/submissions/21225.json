So far, unfortunately, something has always come up, but the trip exactly to Rome with my dad is very important to me.

The last time I asked when we were going together was earlier this week. \n\nA few days ago I met with my dad and he told me in passing that he was flying to Rome with his girlfriend and their two sons, because the sons couldn't agree on any other destination.  (gf payed for herself and her sons, dad payed for himself and I would\u2019ve payed for myself) No one talked to me or thought about whether I might want to go. Of course I was a bit surprised and also very hurt that my dad uses the first chance to go to Rome, of all places, without me and also about the fact that I am the only one who does not come along. I told him so, whereupon he became angry and said I have a boyfriend at home so it does not matter that I am the only one who does not come. He also said that since I have already traveled more than his girlfriend and her children, we still have plenty of time to go to Rome. I told him that was not the point.  I said I don't know if I will forgive him so quickly if he makes especially this trip without me. We argued about it and it quickly escalated. He said I'm a shitty daughter and it's okay for him if we don't talk anymore just because I can't get over it.

Remember that you decided your new gf and her children were more important than me and remember that you decided to choose them for a trip we had been planning for years. Remember that you decided your child didn\u2019t matter as much as your new gf.

Op I think you may need to find a counselor because this behavior may escalate and it will compound the hurt.

Does that mean you live with him? Can you move in with your mom or get an apartment? Cuz that is what I would  do.

Once he realised you were upset, he could\u2019ve invited you, or at the very least been apologetic about the situation.\n\nI\u2019m curious: do you believe your dad that they are going to Rome because it was the only place his girlfriend\u2019s children could agree on?\n\n(Edit: Sorry, it was your dad's girlfriend, not a new wife, so I've edited for that)", "I'm leaning towards YTA here tbh. \n\nHim going to rome with his family doesn't mean you can't go with him another time, you've already said you've travelled a lot with your family and that his family haven't travelled so much, let him have a trip with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
