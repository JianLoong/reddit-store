I'm asking what the dynamic is here that people are taking that as a slight against them personally.", "I live in NZ and everything is so damn expensive here at the moment.

Does she realise she's asking for $100k?", ">What local wedding comes out at the same cost as a destination wedding?\n\nWeddings people on reddit talk about. If the money is coming from a joint account that you and your wife contribute to then you and your wife need to have a discussion about it. Figure out a budget and tell your daughter that. If she and her partner want to contribute to that for a destination wedding that will your daughter and her partner's decision.", "Yeah usually, but I saw post here before where a poster was complaining that it was a destination wedding, because some people use it as a destination.  The family lived an hour away by car.", "And lodging and food", "Pay for the wedding and not the flights, then? It wouldn't kill them to save up money for their own flights.", "You\u2019re right it is expensive, but you state you can afford it and just don\u2019t want to because you think it\u2019s pointless. Which makes you an AH. Its not an issue of money per your own admission.", "That's not forcing you to foot the bill. That's daring you not to spend more. You need to be clear that you won't go a penny over your contribution amount. Then you need to stand firm.\n\nIf your daughter uses it as a down payment, then it's up to her how she wants to handle it when she runs out of money. It's a learning experience that's probably overdue. Her wedding, her responsibility.", "literally just dont pay??? it\u2019s not your name being signed on those contracts. or if you have some sort of trust for her, if she does go over the money you gave her then take it out of that\n\nif you really want to be generous maybe you can offer her a local wedding her and a very small wedding ceremony of just parents and siblings in NZ. or a NZ honeymoon", "That is hugely manipulative of her. If that can\u2019t be avoided you obviously will have to stand your ground.", "What\u2019s your definition of a pointless showing of wealth here? If she has it at a nice vineyard stateside that people still have to travel for and wants to serve a steak option, an open bar, and a three-tier cake, will that also be pointless? Is the line solely anything not in the continental US?", "INFO Where do you live?

He can do what he wants with it. That IS the point. There are limits and this is one of his. Want a reasonably priced wedding sure- want one that is WAY too expensive then figure it out - pretty simple.

That does not count if I end up covering for our family members that cannot afford to make it.", "We have an agreement that we cannot spend over a certain amount without approval from the other. Our limit is 5k. She would need a lot more than that. I doubt 5k would even cover travel room and board for two people.", "Its about 200k, OP stated in another comment she asked for about that much.

Traveling there is expensive, and difficult (long flight, crazy time change), plus stuff there (lodging, food, etc) is also expensive.

If she plans a weddings that costs $500,000; does OP have to foot the bill, or can he say that its too expensive? Is there such a thing as too expensive, or does OP have to pay for whatever the daughter can think of now that he's offered a gift? After all, if OP said not to any wedding request that his daughter comes up with, that would be adding strings to the gift offer, right?", "Honestly - I don't really see the difference between your example and DJ\\_HouseShoes's...\n\nSure - your sounds more reasonable when comparing against a theoretical $55 mil/person wedding in space, but that's still expensive.\n\n\\--\n\nIf someone is going to pay for something for you, they have every right to place limits on what they will pay for as it is THEIR money that you are using.  Even, for arguments' sake, if they don't want to pay for a wedding at a specific cheap, local venue then they would still be in the right.\n\nThis doesn't mean a middle ground can't be reached though.  OP *could* offer to pay up to $X and then the rest would have to be sourced elsewhere.  At the very least - this option would not go directly against OP's financial values.", "I feel like a lot of the N T As are about destination weddings themselves and not the actual situation at hand. \n\nIts like if OP offered to buy them a car and when they picked out the car they said no, not that car.", "You're missing the point. If the wedding is too expensive and exceeds the father's budget, all he has to do is help with the amount he promised and let the bride and groom work out the rest. Refusing to contribute (even though you've promised) just because you don't approve of the bride and groom's choice makes you an asshole.\n\nJudge the situation as a whole instead of sticking to \"his money his choice\" rules not everything is black and white, a little critical thinking doesn't hurt.", "You could put a down payment on a house for that here. Tell her she's delusional. NTA.", "That is so much I thought destination wedding were supposed to be cheaper. Could you convince her to have a local wedding if you give a nice chunk of money for a honeymoon or house?", "That's beyond ridiculous. I'd offer to pay for up to a certain amount, and that would be my limit. You can have a lovely and even extravagant wedding spending FAR less than that.\n\nAnd not that I think you need to compromise, but why can't she have a local(ish) wedding, and then have a big honeymoon in New Zealand? That would make far more sense, except I suspect you are right and she just wants to flaunt \"her\" wealth and feels entitled to do so.", "INFO: did you agree to pay for the wedding before discussing the budget?\n\n$5k doesn\u2019t cover the costs of most weddings, destination or not.

He never had that convo but stated that his budget was $5000. She is asking for a 200k wedding \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 just ridiculous!!! You are changing your story now lol.
