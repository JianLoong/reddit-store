Premarital counseling should be a requirement before any money gets spent. Too many marriages end before the debt for the wedding is paid off.\n2.

Your wife should be right there with you, pulling back on your daughter\u2019s reigns.  Why isn\u2019t she?  Maybe a little couples counseling to get a third party perspective.\n3. If you give in to your daughter and your wife\u2019s manipulative behavior, you establish a pattern that they will use from now on.  Sometimes you have to be willing to die on that hill.  This may be that time.  If not spending an enormous sum of money (by the way, just food for thought, this is literally a life changing amount of money for the majority of Americans\u2026 being spent on one day) on a wedding makes your wife and daughter actually cease loving you as a person, maybe that\u2019s something you need to know and maybe you have some life decisions to make, now that you have that data.\n\nI hope your daughter wakes up to the fact the she lives a very privileged life.

Any house for $200K is going to be a bad house in a bad/rural area. \n\nI think that person was just exaggerating but $200K could definitely pay for almost half of a house which is still A LOT of money.", "Ok in fairness we\u2019re doing a courthouse wedding with our parents and one other witness and then a reception that\u2019s buffet and the open bar is the most expensive thing. It\u2019s more like we\u2019re throwing a party than a wedding. \n\nMy partner is going all out on the honeymoon though and that is very expensive. \n\nBut we\u2019re older. I\u2019m 38 and he\u2019s 41. Both first marriage. My dad is gone and my living grandfather is over 90 and there\u2019s no one to walk me down the aisle anyway. I don\u2019t want a white dress. I don\u2019t want all the engagement stuff people do in the lead up to the wedding. It\u2019s honestly stressful to me. \n\nSo for young people who want to do the whole thing, or even older people too, I get it\u2019s an industry. We\u2019re not on a tight budget but we both don\u2019t want all the hassle either.\n\nMy priorities are:\n-get the legal part done\n-have fun without drama\n-look super hot\n\nIn that order", "Yeah I saw he said he could give her $5k no problem and I\u2019m like, wait, so there was absolutely zero discussion and/or they\u2019re absolutely rich if he and his wife are allowed to spend $5k without consulting the other first. \n\nIt does seem like either 1-the daughter is financially irresponsible or 2-she\u2019s a genius. He said most of the family can\u2019t go and don\u2019t have passports\u2026seems that could be her reasoning why  she picked New Zealand then. \ud83e\udd23 I wonder if she\u2019s feeling pressured to have a certain type of family wedding (all pure conjecture, there\u2019s no sign of that that I saw).", "The amount of googling I had to do to get that reference... and I'm still not 100% sure \ud83e\udd23", "No one will see the extravagance of a honeymoon \ud83d\ude4c", "Oh wow, that's some major \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 here, OP! The honeymoon and the marriage should be most important to her but seems like it's all about the wedding?", "The marriage isn\u2019t going to last. Speaking from experience, she wants the wedding, not the marriage. You\u2019re in for a bad ride, my friend. Prepare yourself.", "The marriage is supposed to be the important part... The honeymoon is the first chance you really get to focus on making the marriage the best it can be.", "Yeah, this is all about showing off ***your money*** and how ***she*** spent it. If she thinks the wedding/reception is the important part of getting married, she isn't mature enough to be getting married in the first place.", "The point I'm making is it is cheaper for people living in NZ to have a nice wedding outside of the country than it is to have one in the country.", "Everybody will say yes until they actually have to pay for it.", "Wild isn't it!", ">Who will she show off to if no one can come?\n\nSocial media. I guess for someone like her, actual physical friends and relatives aren't as important to her as her dayly doses of 15 minutes of (photoshopped) fame.", "The internet", "Gotcha, thanks for explaining, the wording was a bit wonky to me. Sounds like you\u2019re in a bit of a pickle. \nIn that case, it would probably make the most sense for you and your wife to agree upon what stipulations you plan to apply if you move forward with paying for the wedding. Than have a sit down with your daughter to discuss those stipulations and decisions. If the wedding not being a destination wedding is one you/your wife agree on, in part so the family you intend on having her invite can go, then that needs to be made clear to her. After that your daughter can decide for herself if she wants to pay for the destination wedding or have a wedding in NY.", "Dollary doos made me night. Thank you friend \ud83e\udee0", "You\u2019re beating the point into submission.", "Love it! Too many don't think about the marriage, just the wedding. Been married for 40 years.", "Nothing wrong with the courthouse! You're saving on a lot there - officiant, expenses related to bridesmaids & groomsmen, a lot of the floral costs, ceremony program printing, staffing costs for moving chairs/tables from ceremony to reception layout, etc. And it's generally easier to have an intimate, meaningful experience WITHOUT a big audience. \n\nMy biggest expense will be the buffet, since I found a remarkably affordable venue. But all the little things add up too. As an example, we're expecting to spend over 1k on a bus service between the venue and a nearby town that has hotels - unfortunately we can't trust certain guests to designate a driver, and there's no uber/lyft in the area, so this is kinda necessary for us.\n\nI saved a lot of money by buying a $100 dress, but I'm definitely gonna have to pay to get it tailored. Turns out, plenty of nice bridesmaid dresses are offered in 'ivory' so I went with that. Honestly I was tempted by some really elaborate MOB/MOG dresses, but they just didn't look as comfortable.", "It's a reference to Lord of the Rings. The movies were filmed in New Zealand.", "I was just thinking about how OP would feel if she\u2019s divorced within 5 years?"]}
