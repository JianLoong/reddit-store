My only cousin Claire (26F) is 30 weeks pregnant. Everyone is super excited as this will be the first baby in the family since I was born. Claire also had a miscarriage at 19 weeks a couple years ago which was really devastating for her and our family.\n\nI came out as FTM trans to my friends about a year ago, but waited to tell my family because I was worried about their reactions. But they were beginning to suspect it because of my increasingly male appearance. When I officially came out to them last weekend, the response was pretty much that they love me and want me to be happy. Claire was even correcting our grandma whenever she\u2019d slip up and call me \u2018she\u2019 instead of \u2018he\u2019.\n\nI also asked my family to please call me by my name, Eli. I could see the smile wipe off Claire\u2019s face. Later, Claire took me aside and told me that she has always loved the name Eli and had chosen that name for her baby boy. She never told anyone this because she wanted the name to be a surprise after the baby was born.\n\nI said we could both be named Eli. She said it would be weird for us to have the same name, especially since we\u2019re a small family (there are only six of us, seven after the baby is born). She asked me if I could change my name. I told her it took me a long time to find a name that really felt right for me and that I\u2019ve been going by Eli for seven months now, so I feel settled in the name. She asked if I\u2019ve had my name legally changed yet, which I haven\u2019t. She said it shouldn\u2019t be a problem to change it then and started suggesting other names for me. But I reiterated I want to keep my name.\n\nClaire dropped the conversation then but I could see she looked so hurt and disappointed. She\u2019s been acting frosty with me now and has told the family I\u2019m being selfish. My mom says she \u201cunderstands both sides\u201d but my aunt and uncle (Claire\u2019s parents) and my grandma are saying the name Eli is super special to Claire and changing my name would be a kind thing to do especially considering her miscarriage (edit: if that baby was a boy, she was going to name him Eli also -- I just found this out). But, my name is special to me too\u2026\n\nI\u2019m doubting myself now. I don\u2019t want to change my name but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being too stubborn.

Not saying you should have to cause a rift or that it's fair that a rift would be created, but that is the situation. \n\nIt's interesting because there are lots of stories on here about siblings fighting over baby names, so this kind of stuff has a history of driving wedges in families.   \nObviously, NTA, but you and your cousin should come to some understanding about why the name is special to you both and make sure she knows you see her side of it.

Doesn't matter if it's a family name. No one owns a name. Many families have multiple members with the same name.

I have trans friends who, like you, took a long time to settle on a name that fit them, and people experience things differently, 7 months of using a name that's right for you is significant, especially with transitioning, and Claire possibly doesn't understand that the name Eli means a lot to you too, just for different reasons. She's currently asking you to change it like it isn't a big deal, so I'm guessing she hasn't tried to look at it from your POV. But yeah, she can totally still pick the name, you aren't stopping her.

You look like an Oliver!\"\n\nShe said she's been planning on naming her firstborn son Eli from the time she was a little kid.", "Yeah lol I had that exact same thought.\n\nShe thinks that because she has been planning on naming her firstborn son Eli ever since she was a little kid, and she was going to use that name for her previous baby who was sadly miscarried (if it was a boy), that she has more \"dibs\" on the name than I do.

You chose it, and everyone who knows you has been calling you that for nearly a year. She can name her son Eli as well, it's not a zero-sum game. You are NTA in the slightest. She can either suck it up and use yhe name as planned or find a different one to her tastes.\n\nIn no sane world should you be asked to change your name for someone who doesn't even exist yet.", "Dear Lord, every generation there are at least 2-3 cousins with the same name.

My nephew, my brother, our late father, our late paternal grandfather (named after his uncle, who died long before I was born), and a late, dear family friend who retired to live over my parents' garage all had/have the same first name. Somehow, we all survived the unbearable trauma and confusion. So will your cousin.", "So she's literally causing her own problem here. She wants you to bend waaaaay the hell over backwards to accommodate the fact that she \"feels weird\" about you and her kid having the same name. (Or maybe more accurately, she feels like it would make her baby less special to have to share.) Totally unreasonable and totally not your problem. \n\nThat being said, whether or not it's worth the kickback from your family for \"rocking the boat\" is something only you can decide. You're morally in the clear, but whether it's the right decision for you depends on what you value more, the name you chose or not having your cousin losing her shit at you. My two cents, for what they're worth: you have to put up boundaries with unreasonable people at some point.", "[removed]", "NTA.

All the other comments are telling you how you\u2019re right and she\u2019s wrong\u2014you have that viewpoint covered.\n\nOn a conscious level, you picked the name independently of her and you\u2019ve been using it for awhile. You didn\u2019t set out to hurt her. Clearly, if you\u2019re capable of continuing to use the name, you\u2019re not that close to your cousin. She may never be able to use the name for you and not resent it. You know that and you\u2019re ok with it.\n\nAlso, consider that if it\u2019s a name she loved since childhood, your initial exposure to it was probably from her. It\u2019s probably subconsciously part of why you liked it for yourself.\n\nAs far as your cousin is concerned, the baby has been named Eli since she found out the sex\u2014at 30 weeks, that could be as much as six months (with the first trimester genetic screenings). And her \u201chidden claim\u201d clearly predates yours. She\u2019s right that having two people in a very small family with the same name gets weird and annoying. Also, she didn\u2019t name her child after you and she doesn\u2019t want to have done so. She didn\u2019t want to name her kid after anyone; she wanted the child to be his own person. To have that now, she has to rename her child. You using the name, and not caring that it hurt her, may have already tainted it enough for her that she can\u2019t use it anyway.\n\nIf she were posting here, I\u2019d tell her to keep the name and go very low or no contact with you. Not because you used the name\u2014that was an accident\u2014but because you don\u2019t care that it\u2019s hurting her.\n\nBut, it\u2019s not really your fault either.

The fact that she wanted to name her previous baby Eli makes it worse.", "If she thinks she \"can't \" name her baby Eli because there can't be 2 in the same family, she should have a talk with George Foreman.", "What is the difference of the name being special for you and special for Claire?", "It's special to both of you. No one gets to put dibs on a name. \n\nI'm sorry Claire had a miscarriage,  I can't imagine how awful that would be.\n\nBut what you have been through, struggling with and finally finding your identity is no less meaningful or important.

It's clear that this name is really special to your cousin, and if [if!] she'd made it clear a long time ago that she wanted to name her future baby Eli and how attached she was to that name, *then* you might be TA for choosing it anyway. But she didn't. It's 100% her choice to keep the name a secret, but she has no right to be upset if someone chooses or is given the same name in the meantime.  \n\nIt's not even a big deal to have two family members with the same name. I share my birth name with my cousin, who's a handful of years older. They called her 'Big ____\" and me \"Little ____\" when we were growing up, and aside from a few Christmas present mixups, there was never an issue. I think your cousin is being a little ridiculous about this. Someone else's comment mentioned that it seems she's upset over her baby name not being 'unique enough', and I have to agree. If the baby is named Eli, *they* certainly won't care about sharing the name. Speaking from experience, they may even find it cool and look up to you more than other relatives.\n\nWhat particularly concerns me though, is you mentioning in a comment that Claire told you your name wasn't \"real\" or something similar, because you've \"only\" had it for seven months. I'm not about to jump on her and call her a bigot, especially since you mentioned she has gone out of her way to support you and correct misgendering. But saying your chosen name isn't real/real enough is incredibly transphobic of her, and I would've been so pissed if someone said that to me. And like someone else pointed out, her baby has had the name for exactly zero months and she certainly considers that to be real. Why the double standard? I think she owes you an apology for that, honestly.\n\nSo, overall, NTA, and don't let anybody tell you your name isn't real.
