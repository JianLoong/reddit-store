Sorry for being misleading in anyway \n\nEdit 2 : My sister was not financially responsible for me or my brother. We both lived with our dad at the time so food and housing was paid for already. Our dad just refused to help with the kids full stop\n\nSo, at the time I  (17f) was living with my family including my sister (27f). She had 3 children, a daughter (6f) and two sons (5m) and (3m). At this point my sister was (and had been doing so for a year) was putting no effort into raising her children. To the extent that I was making their breakfast, getting them ready for school / preschool, all while getting myself ready for college. I would make sure they had their homework ready and any supplies they needed for school that day. My sister would show up just in time to take them to school.\n\nIn the evenings I would come home to my brother (14f) making their dinner because my sister wasn't home. I would then do their bedtime routine.\n\nTheir dad had them on weekends. She barely saw those kids. \n\n( holidays it was worse because she'd disappear all day and I'd have them all day) \n\nAnytime she wanted to go socialise I would always have to look after the children because \"my free time\" translated to \"time free to be babysitter\".\n\nIt got to the point where the kids wouldn't listen to her, where I'd been put in the parent position constantly, they'd respond to me and not her. This meant on days out she would beg me to come with her and then when I wouldn't go she would tell the children \"it's your aunts fault we can't go anywhere, she's why I'm unhappy, go tell her she's ruined today\".\n\nOne occasion I was invited to a get together with my friends. I had no prior commitments so I went. I get a call at 5pm from my frantic sister saying \"why aren't you home? Work have asked me to come in and I need someone here\". \nI said that \"if work have asked you on your day off you can say no, I barely go out as it is\" \nShe ended up screaming at me, calling me a child and said \"if you looked after the kids as much as you complain that you do then I'd have the money to move out by now\". I didn't exaggerate. She followed it up by saying \" I don't even ask you for that much, you just babysit a few hours a week\" ( or something to that effect) I got so annoyed but knew the kids were nearby and I wasn't going to start screaming at their mother while they were in ear shot so I hung up. \n\nSo, when I left home to live with another relative, the last phone call she had she said \" I can't get out of work and have to leave in an hour, so you'll have to just come back and look after them\". To which I said no and blocked her. Haven't spoken to her since.\n\nThe relative I live with and my partner say fair enough and a child shouldn't be put in the position me and my younger brother were put in. \n\nBut my sisters friend somehow got into contact with me calling me an AH saying that everyone helps with their family and I shouldn't have been sensitive and been to big to help my family.\nSo was I the AH?", "created_utc": 1690590456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cdzix/aita_for_abandoning_my_sister_when_she_needed_help/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're still a child yourself. You need to be preparing to live your own life and start adulthood in your own child free way. As you said, you're going to start college soon, and that's a big deal. You quite literally do not have time to be mothering someone else's children while you prepare for college at 17 years old. If what your sister says about work needing her constantly is true, she needs to arrange for alternative child care, or the father of said children needs to be more involved in their lives.\n\nExactly zero of this is your responsibility.
