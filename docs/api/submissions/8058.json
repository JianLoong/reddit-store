It's is traditional in Russian culture to offer dishes to guests, but as smb have already pointed out, they don't expect you to gobble up half the table. And the cake situation is just too much, how many pieces did you have? 7-8? How big was the cake, did you take half of it?", "YTA big time for taking SEVEN pieces when there were others eating too. But you are especially for not leaving your Tupperware three pieces behind after you heard Nina wishing she had \"leftover\" cake. Even if you didn't react fast enough to think of that, why on Earth didn't you share with your roommate who invited you to her grandmother's house in the first place??\n\nOffering guests food is a politeness, just as taking only a reasonable portion is a politeness.", "YTA. Seven slices of cake?!", "I think you\u2019re a little bit YTA. There\u2019s a fine line between politely accepting what\u2019s offered and ending up eating loads and taking even more portions home. Most people offer out of politeness but not really except people to take, as you did, four portions of cake home with them. (Unless they were offering you to take it for you and your three family members/roommate etc).  Polite would have been to take one portion home, especially since you\u2019d already eaten three!", "YTA. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but especially with the cake it seems excessive to take 7 slices. Putting cake in a Tupperware to take home before everyone was finished eating it seemed awfully rude and rushed, and in many cultures, it is seen as taboo to take the last slice. There\u2019s nothing wrong with eating a lot of food, but you have be conscious of how much there is for everyone else.", "\u201cThey were food shaming me!!\u201d Dude, you ate the entire cake.. no no, not ate it, ate half, then took the other half home. No one was food shaming you, whatever that means. They were calling you out for being incredibly greedy. YTA", "Whoa... my guess u didn get invited out much while growing up", "YTA for overindulging in a way that affected others and clearly affecting their experience at the party.  You probably missed some social cues about the matter too.", "So you heard someone say they like leftover cake as you took 7 pieces away with you and didn't think to share? YTA", "YTA\n\nThey were polite, you were greedy. They are not foodshaming you, they are shaming you for your bad manners.", "I think the amount you ate at the party is nobody elses business, nothing wrong with that. However,\nINFO. \nJust to clarify, you overheard your roommate Nina say she was disappointed that she wouldn't have any leftover cake, and then in the following days, you, who has several pieces of leftover cake taken home in a tupperware, didn't share a single piece with her?", "YTA \n\nIt's common in many cultures to offer extra portions to be polite, but you're not actually meant to take 7 whole ass slices of a cake. Many families eat the leftovers as their meal the following day, and you took that from them.\n\nYou were incredibly greedy and rude.", "YTA, not in a big way, but there are cultural differences and you should be paying attention to them. I would say most, if not all, cultures have a variety of situations where you are *expected* to say no to things even though they are being offerred to you. Grandmas are expected to offer too much and you are not expected to take all of it, there are a variety of sociological reasons for this but it doesn't matter why, it's a fact of life.\n\nWhat you *should* be doing is observing what others do and trying to act accordingly, especially if someone is your friends. It's the obligation of the guest to not take too much from the host, but it's the obligation of the host to keep offering. You should have noticed no one else was taking any, and in fact in most social situations eating 3x as much as anyone else is extremely gauche. You decided to treat it as an opportunity to maximise how much stuff you get for free. Pay attention next time you get invited somewhere so you behave in a non-embarrassing way - if you get invited out again.", "YTA for not sharing the cake. And you should never take the last of the cake. Other guests may have wanted some but saw how enthusiastic you were taking three pieces and were polite not to take the last one, then you eat that one too. Just never take the last of anything.", "HUGE YTA. \n\nMajor Sub Sandwich Guy vibes over here. \n\nYou heard your friend be obviously sad that she did get any of the cake that her family made, at her family's event, that she was nice enough to invite you to. And you don't even offer up the like 4 slices you have stashed in a bag?! \n\nWhat is wrong with you?", "YTA and a glutton. That's not foods gaming it's a fact that nojne gets second until everyone has had some who wanted some.", "YTA\n\nHow are you taking a total of 7slices and not thinking there is an issue?\n\nSo weird.", "Soft YTA, the polite thing to have done once you heard that Ninas favourite thing was the left over cake would have been to split what you had with her.", "YTA because not body shaming, but you did eat far too much for a single person at a group gathering. This isn't about your own habits when preparing food, this is about your behavior in public. \n\nI love food, I can eat a significant amount if I like something, but I never eat more than my fair share at a gathering like the one you went to. And taking home so much, that's just overkill. So what you were offered? You can respectfully turn it down. I have taken leftovers home when offered but never more than a single serve. \n\nFrom how much you ate there to how much you took home was a fail in social etiquette for me personally.", "Yta but this has to be fake. There is to many stories going around AITA about roommates offering ice-cream and then eating 3 pints of it. And a other one about eating all the food as well. It's just bad writing.", "YTA. Just because you\u2019re offered food, doesn\u2019t mean you eat enough for 7 people.", "YTA. They are Slavic, they will offer you food until they have none. Guests are really important in Slavic culture. You need to say \u201cthank you, it\u2019s enough for me\u201d at SOME point. You can\u2019t just devour every edible item because they offer it to you out of politeness and culture. Like, 6 pieces of cake? Wtf? \n\nAlso, you sound like you have no respect for the cultural food. Medovik is not a crepe cake. It\u2019s a really complicated desert which takes hours to make. When my mother done it for the first time it took almost the whole day. If some guest finished medovik just because they greedy and had no idea where to stop, I would be mad too.", "ESH youre friends are AHs except Nina and you kinda suck too only because you had 6 (3 there + 3 you took home) slices taking that last 1 was just over the top", "YTA", "N T A for eating but taking half of it home and not leaving them with any leftovers? Seriously YTA for that.", "You are NTA. I'm part russian myself and if someone eating that much cake and food. My family would be happy cause no leftovers and a happy visitor. When she likes the last piece of cake than the need to say that. It's not your fault when she didn't react. Yeah maybe you eat a bit much cake but when the grandma did it. I can tell she is happy that you are happy from here cake. When every body got a piece and didn't want the last pieces where is the problem. When it was a family NYE then there was russian family who can make this cake self. So when they didn't want more cake than eat.\n\nAnd maybe just tell nina you didn't know that she loves the last piece and say you can split or something like that.\n\nEdit.\nWhy do i get down votes?\nI'm just telling my perspective.\nI know every body is different.\nBut from the Russian family's i know.\nIf you eat much they are very happy.\nIf you ask if they can give you some of the food with you for later. They gone be happy", "NTA, but inconsiderate imo. If I'm invited to eat cake and already had three slices I would never take so many slices home. Even if it was offered (russian hospitality) you should probably only have taken one slice home or none at all.", "YTA, being a guest at a home is kind of like being treated out to dinner.  You don\u2019t order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, at a home you don\u2019t blatantly overindulge, in a restaurant you don\u2019t order multiple desserts, at a home you don\u2019t eat half the cake.  \n\nAlthough Nina\u2019s family was \u201csuper welcoming\u201d I\u2019m sure by the night it wearing thin,  pigging out on the cake and hogging the leftovers was icing on the cake.  If I was Nina your invitation would be permanently revoked.", "No one gives a shit about your body or body shaming you. It\u2019s rude to be so greedy. A lot of cultures have the offer guests food tradition but you\u2019re not actually supposed to eat all the food and the kitchen sink. Read the room. YTA.", "NTA\nYou should have shared the cake with Nina, but honestly, whether to accept food or not is one of  those huge cultural pitfalls you need to research before.", "NTA - food was freely offered to all. If Nina wanted leftover cake, she could have taken the last slice.", "NTA. You knew what you wanted, you spoke up when everyone else was silent. If she wanted the leftover cake, she should have said yes herself and then saved it herself. Her grandmother probably felt so happy that you were enthusiastic and enjoying her food/dessert.", "NTA as someone from eastern europe myself i can assure you the grandma was definitievely very happy you liked her food and took some for home.\n\nIt is actually culturally offensive to reject offered food when you're invited somewhere.\n\nYour roomates have no word in what you eat nor how much it was def not their buisness, they're just jealous you enjoyed yourself.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with being enthusiastic about food that someone else cooked", "NTA\n\nI just think it's super weird that there's this unspoken, unwritten expectation that you're not supposed to eat or take the food that someone is offering you. It's like a trick and if you don't choose the right thing, you're an asshole. The sooner we can dispense with such stupid, wasteful traditions the better! \n\nI only think you're a little bit of an asshole for not sharing the cake after you found out your friend wanted some. Though I've been scratching my head over why your friend didn't just speak up when the leftovers were being offered if she wanted it so bad?", "NTA\n\nNever ever turn down good food!  Too bad for Nina, she should have gotten a slice not wait for you to get one for her.  Why didn't she ask?  Close mouth doesn't get fed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Lol foodshaming. You ate food for seven people man. You should be ashamed.", "YTA are you serious", "It\u2019s not quite as bad as the subway sub guy, but you are definitely in glutton hall of fame training. YTA. Have some consideration for others, and think about the fact that you should not have taken so much. You definitely deserved the calling out on your greed.

But inside the reasonable limits! \n\nFor example, eating 3 slices is a lot, ok, but I did it too sometimes (especially if everyone was eating along, it's no problem, it all depends on the vibe and family)... But if you eat that much during dinner, then it's polite not to bring home the leftovers! Or at least be REALLY sure that nobody wants them. Which mean you have to actually give the opportunity to others, because if you rush to take the leftovers, of course the hosts + other guests would feel uncomfortable blocking you. You have to wait for the hosts to explicitly ask if someone wants the leftovers (sometimes there is so much leftovers that would be wasted especially if the hosts are just a couple or a single person). At that point, wait a bit to see if some guests are interested as well and if you taking leftovers is an actual offer.", "YTA especially for not offering the cake you took home to Nina, as she lives with you.", "You cannot possibly think this was ok. You heard a person who was upset they had no leftovers, and you wandered off with **4 f-ing slices** to take home, after eating 3, and didn\u2019t offer any? No one ever taught you manners? I would be mortified if I were you. YTA", "The cake thing was a bit too far but the rest of it is fine. Tina and Alex are mad, but it wasn't even their party or grandmother. And Nina only seems to be bothered about the cake thing, so I don't see why Tina and Alex are in such a fuss about it. Maybe they're from a culture where this isn't normal? If my mom were to offer guests a lot of food, she wouldn't be mad if the guests accepted it, especially at a party where there's so much.

That guy ended up eating so much he puked.\n\nI'm going with NTA. You only took what you were offered and took what no one else wanted. It would have been nice of you to offer Nina some of the cake you took since you have a bunch of slices, but again, you only have that many because it was offered to you and the last slice because no one else wanted it.\n\nAs a host of a party or someone who paid for the cake, I wouldn't get mad at someone enjoying the cake and taking what no one else wanted.
