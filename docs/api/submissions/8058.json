It's is traditional in Russian culture to offer dishes to guests, but as smb have already pointed out, they don't expect you to gobble up half the table. And the cake situation is just too much, how many pieces did you have? 7-8? How big was the cake, did you take half of it?", "YTA big time for taking SEVEN pieces when there were others eating too. But you are especially for not leaving your Tupperware three pieces behind after you heard Nina wishing she had \"leftover\" cake. Even if you didn't react fast enough to think of that, why on Earth didn't you share with your roommate who invited you to her grandmother's house in the first place??\n\nOffering guests food is a politeness, just as taking only a reasonable portion is a politeness.", "YTA. Seven slices of cake?!", "I think you\u2019re a little bit YTA. There\u2019s a fine line between politely accepting what\u2019s offered and ending up eating loads and taking even more portions home. Most people offer out of politeness but not really except people to take, as you did, four portions of cake home with them. (Unless they were offering you to take it for you and your three family members/roommate etc).  Polite would have been to take one portion home, especially since you\u2019d already eaten three!", "YTA. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but especially with the cake it seems excessive to take 7 slices. Putting cake in a Tupperware to take home before everyone was finished eating it seemed awfully rude and rushed, and in many cultures, it is seen as taboo to take the last slice. There\u2019s nothing wrong with eating a lot of food, but you have be conscious of how much there is for everyone else.", "\u201cThey were food shaming me!!\u201d Dude, you ate the entire cake.. no no, not ate it, ate half, then took the other half home. No one was food shaming you, whatever that means. They were calling you out for being incredibly greedy. YTA", "Whoa... my guess u didn get invited out much while growing up", "YTA for overindulging in a way that affected others and clearly affecting their experience at the party.  You probably missed some social cues about the matter too.", "So you heard someone say they like leftover cake as you took 7 pieces away with you and didn't think to share? YTA", "YTA\n\nThey were polite, you were greedy. They are not foodshaming you, they are shaming you for your bad manners.", "I think the amount you ate at the party is nobody elses business, nothing wrong with that. However,\nINFO. \nJust to clarify, you overheard your roommate Nina say she was disappointed that she wouldn't have any leftover cake, and then in the following days, you, who has several pieces of leftover cake taken home in a tupperware, didn't share a single piece with her?", "YTA \n\nIt's common in many cultures to offer extra portions to be polite, but you're not actually meant to take 7 whole ass slices of a cake. Many families eat the leftovers as their meal the following day, and you took that from them.\n\nYou were incredibly greedy and rude.", "YTA, not in a big way, but there are cultural differences and you should be paying attention to them. I would say most, if not all, cultures have a variety of situations where you are *expected* to say no to things even though they are being offered to you. Grandmas are expected to offer too much and you are not expected to take all of it, there are a variety of sociological reasons for this but it doesn't matter why, it's a fact of life.\n\nWhat you *should* be doing is observing what others do and trying to act accordingly, especially if someone is your friends. It's the obligation of the guest to not take too much from the host, but it's the obligation of the host to keep offering. You should have noticed no one else was taking any, and in fact in most social situations eating 3x as much as anyone else is extremely gauche. You decided to treat it as an opportunity to maximise how much stuff you get for free. Pay attention next time you get invited somewhere so you behave in a non-embarrassing way - if you get invited out again.", "YTA for not sharing the cake. And you should never take the last of the cake. Other guests may have wanted some but saw how enthusiastic you were taking three pieces and were polite not to take the last one, then you eat that one too. Just never take the last of anything.", "HUGE YTA. \n\nMajor Sub Sandwich Guy vibes over here. \n\nYou heard your friend be obviously sad that she did get any of the cake that her family made, at her family's event, that she was nice enough to invite you to. And you don't even offer up the like 4 slices you have stashed in a bag?! \n\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nETA: I always open my cupboards to my guests, and love to see them enjoy what I cook. But if I had a guest that took almost an entire dish, and then even more to bring home, I would be astounded at their lack of manners, and most likely not invite them back. You weren't even an invited guest of the host, you were a +1. \n\nGrandma didn't force feed you, so you don't get to blame her for your lack of control. But \"ShE kEpT oFfErInG\", get TF out of here with that. They aren't shaming you for stuffing your face, they are shaming you for your selfishness.", "YTA and a glutton. That's not foods shaming. It's a fact that no-one gets second/ or in your case fifths(?) until everyone has had some who wanted some.\n\nEdited for spelling", "YTA\n\nHow are you taking a total of 7slices and not thinking there is an issue?\n\nSo weird.", "Soft YTA, the polite thing to have done once you heard that Ninas favourite thing was the left over cake would have been to split what you had with her.", "YTA because not body shaming, but you did eat far too much for a single person at a group gathering. This isn't about your own habits when preparing food, this is about your behavior in public. \n\nI love food, I can eat a significant amount if I like something, but I never eat more than my fair share at a gathering like the one you went to. And taking home so much, that's just overkill. So what you were offered? You can respectfully turn it down. I have taken leftovers home when offered but never more than a single serve. \n\nFrom how much you ate there to how much you took home was a fail in social etiquette for me personally.", "Yta but this has to be fake. There is to many stories going around AITA about roommates offering ice-cream and then eating 3 pints of it. And a other one about eating all the food as well. It's just bad writing.", "YTA. Just because you\u2019re offered food, doesn\u2019t mean you eat enough for 7 people.", "YTA. They are Slavic, they will offer you food until they have none. Guests are really important in Slavic culture. You need to say \u201cthank you, it\u2019s enough for me\u201d at SOME point. You can\u2019t just devour every edible item because they offer it to you out of politeness and culture. Like, 6 pieces of cake? Wtf? \n\nAlso, you sound like you have no respect for the cultural food. Medovik is not a crepe cake. It\u2019s a really complicated desert which takes hours to make. When my mother done it for the first time it took almost the whole day. If some guest finished medovik just because they greedy and had no idea where to stop, I would be mad too.", "ESH youre friends are AHs except Nina and you kinda suck too only because you had 6 (3 there + 3 you took home) slices taking that last 1 was just over the top", "YTA", "N T A for eating but taking half of it home and not leaving them with any leftovers? Seriously YTA for that.", "You are NTA. I'm part russian myself and if someone eating that much cake and food. My family would be happy cause no leftovers and a happy visitor. When she likes the last piece of cake than the need to say that. It's not your fault when she didn't react. Yeah maybe you eat a bit much cake but when the grandma did it. I can tell she is happy that you are happy from here cake. When every body got a piece and didn't want the last pieces where is the problem. When it was a family NYE then there was russian family who can make this cake self. So when they didn't want more cake than eat.\n\nAnd maybe just tell nina you didn't know that she loves the last piece and say you can split or something like that.\n\nEdit.\nWhy do i get down votes?\nI'm just telling my perspective.\nI know every body is different.\nBut from the Russian family's i know.\nIf you eat much they are very happy.\nIf you ask if they can give you some of the food with you for later. They gone be happy", "NTA, but inconsiderate imo. If I'm invited to eat cake and already had three slices I would never take so many slices home. Even if it was offered (russian hospitality) you should probably only have taken one slice home or none at all.", "YTA, being a guest at a home is kind of like being treated out to dinner.  You don\u2019t order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, at a home you don\u2019t blatantly overindulge, in a restaurant you don\u2019t order multiple desserts, at a home you don\u2019t eat half the cake.  \n\nAlthough Nina\u2019s family was \u201csuper welcoming\u201d I\u2019m sure by the night it wearing thin,  pigging out on the cake and hogging the leftovers was icing on the cake.  If I was Nina your invitation would be permanently revoked.", "No one gives a shit about your body or body shaming you. It\u2019s rude to be so greedy. A lot of cultures have the offer guests food tradition but you\u2019re not actually supposed to eat all the food and the kitchen sink. Read the room. YTA.", "NTA\nYou should have shared the cake with Nina, but honestly, whether to accept food or not is one of  those huge cultural pitfalls you need to research before.", "NTA - food was freely offered to all. If Nina wanted leftover cake, she could have taken the last slice.", "NTA. You knew what you wanted, you spoke up when everyone else was silent. If she wanted the leftover cake, she should have said yes herself and then saved it herself. Her grandmother probably felt so happy that you were enthusiastic and enjoying her food/dessert.", "NTA as someone from eastern europe myself i can assure you the grandma was definitievely very happy you liked her food and took some for home.\n\nIt is actually culturally offensive to reject offered food when you're invited somewhere.\n\nYour roomates have no word in what you eat nor how much it was def not their buisness, they're just jealous you enjoyed yourself.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with being enthusiastic about food that someone else cooked", "NTA\n\nI just think it's super weird that there's this unspoken, unwritten expectation that you're not supposed to eat or take the food that someone is offering you. It's like a trick and if you don't choose the right thing, you're an asshole. The sooner we can dispense with such stupid, wasteful traditions the better! \n\nI only think you're a little bit of an asshole for not sharing the cake after you found out your friend wanted some. Though I've been scratching my head over why your friend didn't just speak up when the leftovers were being offered if she wanted it so bad?", "NTA\n\nNever ever turn down good food!

But inside the reasonable limits! \n\nFor example, eating 3 slices is a lot, ok, but I did it too sometimes (especially if everyone was eating along, it's no problem, it all depends on the vibe and family)... But if you eat that much during dinner, then it's polite not to bring home the leftovers! Or at least be REALLY sure that nobody wants them. Which mean you have to actually give the opportunity to others, because if you rush to take the leftovers, of course the hosts + other guests would feel uncomfortable blocking you. You have to wait for the hosts to explicitly ask if someone wants the leftovers (sometimes there is so much leftovers that would be wasted especially if the hosts are just a couple or a single person; other times, especially if it's a bigger family, leftovers can be easily eaten the following day). At that point, wait a bit to see if some guests are interested as well and if you taking leftovers is an actual offer.\n\nAlso, you live with Nina.

I\u2019ve been in situations where I was told it was rude to refuse seconds and tried to find a second or third stomach (like a cow) to be able to pack it in. But this is willful ignorance. Especially on the leftover front. You have to watch the people around you if you aren\u2019t sure what to do in a cultural situation.

Wtf.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m autistic so it\u2019s possible I\u2019ve misunderstood the social cues. But here\u2019s my understanding of how food at social events works:\n\nWhen you don\u2019t want to eat more- you never just say no to food because that might be seen as rude or insulting the food. So if you are full, then you say that the food was lovely but you couldn\u2019t possibly eat any more since you are stuffed. If they insist, you can suggest that you might have some later when your meal has digested a bit more but you can\u2019t possibly manage any more of the wonderful food. In some cultures, they will keep offering you food even if that means the host doesn\u2019t have enough for themselves, until you say no. Because it\u2019s seen as rude to underfeed guests. So it\u2019s important to be able to say no to food politely.\n\nWhen you do want to eat more- notice how much other people are eating and don\u2019t eat more than that. If everyone is having two slices of cake, then you can eat two slices. Otherwise you end up eating more than your share and it is rude and unfair to others. If you are still hungry and no one else is eating more than you are, you can say how it tasted so good that you\u2019re tempted to have another slice and then wait for someone to encourage you to eat another slice. Don\u2019t accept straight away. Then you say you would feel naughty or greedy or that you would feel bad eating more than your share when no one else has eaten more than two. And then you hope that someone else also eats a third slice with you or someone keeps persuading you that it is fine to eat more and reassurance that everyone else has had enough so eating more is fine. I\u2019m guessing this is where you went wrong- you kept eating more that other people without doing the things to check it was really okay to keep eating more portions and that the extra portions weren\u2019t just being offered out of politeness.\n\nLeftovers- do not take leftovers unless the host directly offers leftovers. If they do, make sure that everyone else also gets a fair share of leftovers or at least a chance to refuse leftovers to take home. You should not have been taking home 3 slices of cake while others weren\u2019t taking home any cake.\n\nIt\u2019s not about body shaming or food shaming you. It\u2019s about weird social rules around food and you breaking those rules.", ">d I got mad at them for food shaming me\n\nI have no idea what food shaming is, but you ate 3 slices of cake, brought 4 home, and then refused to share any of the 4 slices you brought home with Nina, whose family made the cake, and who invited you.\n\n7 SLICES OF CAKE! SEVEN! And you did not share any of the 4 extra you brought. \n\nIs this food shaming? If it is, there is nothing wrong with it.\n\nOf course YTA.", "INFO What were Tina and Alex getting offered and how much much were they getting?", "I feel like you accepted the food to not sound rude, even if you didn't want it, right?", "YTA for taking a lot of the cake.

You accepted.", "Gonna go against the grain and say NTA here.\n\nYou were in an unfamiliar setting and didn't know their traditions. There's all kinds of warnings out there about things certain cultures see as rude, one of the big ones is not accepting offered gifts.

I would like to say that there is nothing wrong with how much she ate at the table (maybe except the cake). During celebrations slavics have mentality that there would be not enough food so we make loads of it. Literally loads. After a celebration, there is a massive amount of leftovers left and you have to live on them for a week at least. And even then, you still throw away a lot of food. So if someone us eating a lot at the table - there is no issue.\nNow  onto the cake. If there is one cake, you usually have one slice or two. You try to make sure that there is a leftover cake for the hosts so they  an enjoy it next day. Especially homemade traditional cake since they need \"sitting\" - some cakes taste best 3 days after making them. Then you take into account if there is enough cake left for close family members for take away. But slavics can be pretty persistant - so you usually agree to take one slice when you are about to leave the house. And if you ate quite a big portion of the cake already - you politely refuse and tell that maybe you will take upon that offer next time.\n\nI am not sure if OP's roomate's family is similar but this is how it goes here.

This being said, expectations should have been explained to you before you went.", "Reading the other comments, I\u2019d say it depends on the culture of the people around the table. If people in my own culture offer food, it\u2019s because they need it gone and nobody accepting the food is kinda rude, pushing the responsibility of eating the food to avoid waste on a single person.

No-one is watching you and giving you the side eye and no one is offering to fill your plate again.  When do you stop eating?  For this image there is enough food for, 25 restaurant meals.  Do you eat 1/2 a cake? Do you 7 steaks? Do you eat until you're full? Do you have 2 plated full? The unspoken rule isn't a trick but it does require you to stop eating when you're full.  Edit it's that people who keep offering are only trying to be polite in general they don't want you to be hungry after they feed you a meal.  So \" hell yeah I can eat 3 1/4 lb cheeseburgers, 2 cups of potatoes salad, fruit salad,  cups of fries and a hot fudge sundae\" won't even register to most people (and that is a lot of food say close to 3000 calories) it's wow they ate 9 1/4 cheese burgers, 2 lbs of potatoes salad, 2lbs of fries, and 3 hot fudge sundae.

They came from a clean your plate there is no such thing as leftovers and would eat all the food on the table no matter how much. We don't know how much OP ate so I'll use my ex as an example.  Mom invited us for dinner, she made 2 meatloaf's 1 for us to take home( dinner lunch tomorrow you'll probably have to freeze some) and one for all of us to have dinner together (and to be dinner for her and dad the next day). She over cooked by any   normal accounting of serving size.  4 adults 1 toddler, 5lbs of meat plus sides.   He sat and ate 4 lbs of meat loaf, idk how ever many mashed potatoes you get out of 5 lb of potatoes and whatever and vegetable were.  16 700+ calorie meals.  If Op ate everything like they did the cake, we're talking about 3-7 1500-3000 calorie meals.  \n\nOp didn't say \" I was hungry\" op got sick in a loop with grandma.

I don't like to eat and get stuffed because then I'm physically uncomfortable. I would eat enough to get full and then if they kept offering different dishes I would have continued to say no and not being big on sweets I wouldn't have finished one slice much less 3 or 5 and then taken some leftovers. And that's just me having some self control. not even observing other cultural norms. OK so the OP didn't understand it was a cultural thing and was being offered with the expectation of Them needing to turn it down. Putting that to the side though as an American citizen and going out to lunch with coworkers I would eat less so I Didn't appear to be a pig lol. We've had potlucks at work and some of the food was really good and I'm like I'm gonna sneak back in after everybody's done and take some leftovers so I can have dinner and I was self-conscious about doing that so how somebody could just eat and eat and eat It's beyond me.

They (especially the mom) always offered me tons of food and gave me some to take home on big events when there were leftovers.

When i host,  I'm glad if all the food goes so i don't have to deal with it.", "But if I had people over, I also wouldn't eat most of the cake. I would recognize that even though there is cake left over, I have had more than enough and that maybe someone else would want some even if they aren't racing up to the table to get it.\n\nI don't think the OP is AH because they ate food at the host's urging.  I think they were the AH because they didn't stop to consider that they were being super extra by taking all that cake for themselves.  No one should have to explicitly say, \"Don't eat seven slices of cake at a dinner party you are a tag-a-long for\" for someone to know that this is extreme behavior.", "But they still wanted to offer it around in case someone they invited into their home wanted it more. They invited people over to feed them, they wanted to make sure they fed them as promised. So again it would have been \u201cdoes anyone want this? No one?\u201d And OP says \u201cI\u2019ll take it\u201d and they say \u201cnot you!\u201d", "Yeah, that\u2019s the same thing my mother taught me as a child (with FHB and leftovers)\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "In Russian culture it\u2019s also okay to take leftovers when offered. \n\nIt\u2019s also common that nobody want\u2019s to take the last piece/ bite (even if they would like). \n\n\u2026I think there are plenty of \u201crules\u201d that are hard to get if you are from another culture \ud83d\ude05\n\nMy response was in regarding to the question why Nina got no offer.", "why? someone has to", "Exactly! I think OP definitely went overboard (I love sweets but 7 pieces of cake total is a lot) but if no one else was calling dibs, then it\u2019s not the end of the world. I would absolutely want my guests to get dibs on food before leaving leftovers because I can make it again.", "The trick is learning the fine art of playing with your food, so it seems like you're gobbling it up but not actually putting food in your mouth.", "Fucking hell, Sardinian are something else, they put you through the full kicker. I don\u2019t even want to think about the shits you took.", "Nobody wants to admit they ate 9 cans of ravioli.", "Wow that dude sounds gross", "Why is your husband still friends with him?! Why do you bother cooking for him? :(", "Yes that would be rude. Which is why you shouldn't offer something you don't want to give away.", "I assume it goes back in the hosts fridge so they can have a snack the next day as a reward for their hard work.", "I have a Baba and absolutely feel this. Being delicate about refusing food really is a skill you learn. And don\u2019t get me wrong I absolutely DO want to eat it, but my stomach simply won\u2019t do it.", "Big fan of creatively arranging what\u2019s left on the plate to look like a actually ate more than I did", "She's just \"enjoying herself\"", "I imagine if someone else who didn\u2019t have 3 leftover pieces of cake had taken it then OP\u2019s roommate would have been less irked. The issue is the fact that OP took *so many*.", "I think this is really a cultural thing. In my culture you\u2019d immediately know the difference, if you\u2019ve grown up in it. \u201cYou\u2019re taking this home with you, right\u201d or \u201csomeone has to eat that, we don\u2019t want it\u201d = take the last piece. Otherwise, no. And in this case OP didn\u2019t take the last piece, they took the last FOUR pieces, with the other three already being in the Tupperware container."]}
