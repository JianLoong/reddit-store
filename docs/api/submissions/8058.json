It's is traditional in Russian culture to offer dishes to guests, but as smb have already pointed out, they don't expect you to gobble up half the table. And the cake situation is just too much, how many pieces did you have? 7-8? How big was the cake, did you take half of it?", "YTA big time for taking SEVEN pieces when there were others eating too. But you are especially for not leaving your Tupperware three pieces behind after you heard Nina wishing she had \"leftover\" cake. Even if you didn't react fast enough to think of that, why on Earth didn't you share with your roommate who invited you to her grandmother's house in the first place??\n\nOffering guests food is a politeness, just as taking only a reasonable portion is a politeness.", "YTA. Seven slices of cake?!", "I think you\u2019re a little bit YTA. There\u2019s a fine line between politely accepting what\u2019s offered and ending up eating loads and taking even more portions home. Most people offer out of politeness but not really except people to take, as you did, four portions of cake home with them. (Unless they were offering you to take it for you and your three family members/roommate etc).  Polite would have been to take one portion home, especially since you\u2019d already eaten three!", "YTA. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but especially with the cake it seems excessive to take 7 slices. Putting cake in a Tupperware to take home before everyone was finished eating it seemed awfully rude and rushed, and in many cultures, it is seen as taboo to take the last slice. There\u2019s nothing wrong with eating a lot of food, but you have be conscious of how much there is for everyone else.", "\u201cThey were food shaming me!!\u201d Dude, you ate the entire cake.. no no, not ate it, ate half, then took the other half home. No one was food shaming you, whatever that means. They were calling you out for being incredibly greedy. YTA", "Whoa... my guess u didn get invited out much while growing up", "YTA for overindulging in a way that affected others and clearly affecting their experience at the party.  You probably missed some social cues about the matter too.", "So you heard someone say they like leftover cake as you took 7 pieces away with you and didn't think to share? YTA", "YTA\n\nThey were polite, you were greedy. They are not foodshaming you, they are shaming you for your bad manners.", "I think the amount you ate at the party is nobody elses business, nothing wrong with that. However,\nINFO. \nJust to clarify, you overheard your roommate Nina say she was disappointed that she wouldn't have any leftover cake, and then in the following days, you, who has several pieces of leftover cake taken home in a tupperware, didn't share a single piece with her?", "YTA \n\nIt's common in many cultures to offer extra portions to be polite, but you're not actually meant to take 7 whole ass slices of a cake. Many families eat the leftovers as their meal the following day, and you took that from them.\n\nYou were incredibly greedy and rude.", "YTA, not in a big way, but there are cultural differences and you should be paying attention to them. I would say most, if not all, cultures have a variety of situations where you are *expected* to say no to things even though they are being offerred to you. Grandmas are expected to offer too much and you are not expected to take all of it, there are a variety of sociological reasons for this but it doesn't matter why, it's a fact of life.\n\nWhat you *should* be doing is observing what others do and trying to act accordingly, especially if someone is your friends. It's the obligation of the guest to not take too much from the host, but it's the obligation of the host to keep offering. You should have noticed no one else was taking any, and in fact in most social situations eating 3x as much as anyone else is extremely gauche. You decided to treat it as an opportunity to maximise how much stuff you get for free. Pay attention next time you get invited somewhere so you behave in a non-embarrassing way - if you get invited out again.", "YTA for not sharing the cake. And you should never take the last of the cake. Other guests may have wanted some but saw how enthusiastic you were taking three pieces and were polite not to take the last one, then you eat that one too. Just never take the last of anything.", "HUGE YTA. \n\nMajor Sub Sandwich Guy vibes over here. \n\nYou heard your friend be obviously sad that she did get any of the cake that her family made, at her family's event, that she was nice enough to invite you to. And you don't even offer up the like 4 slices you have stashed in a bag?! \n\nWhat is wrong with you?", "YTA and a glutton. That's not foods shaming. It's a fact that no-one gets second/ or in your case fifths(?) until everyone has had some who wanted some.\n\nEdited for spelling", "YTA\n\nHow are you taking a total of 7slices and not thinking there is an issue?\n\nSo weird.", "Soft YTA, the polite thing to have done once you heard that Ninas favourite thing was the left over cake would have been to split what you had with her.", "YTA because not body shaming, but you did eat far too much for a single person at a group gathering. This isn't about your own habits when preparing food, this is about your behavior in public. \n\nI love food, I can eat a significant amount if I like something, but I never eat more than my fair share at a gathering like the one you went to. And taking home so much, that's just overkill. So what you were offered? You can respectfully turn it down. I have taken leftovers home when offered but never more than a single serve. \n\nFrom how much you ate there to how much you took home was a fail in social etiquette for me personally.", "Yta but this has to be fake. There is to many stories going around AITA about roommates offering ice-cream and then eating 3 pints of it. And a other one about eating all the food as well. It's just bad writing.", "YTA. Just because you\u2019re offered food, doesn\u2019t mean you eat enough for 7 people.", "YTA. They are Slavic, they will offer you food until they have none. Guests are really important in Slavic culture. You need to say \u201cthank you, it\u2019s enough for me\u201d at SOME point. You can\u2019t just devour every edible item because they offer it to you out of politeness and culture. Like, 6 pieces of cake? Wtf? \n\nAlso, you sound like you have no respect for the cultural food. Medovik is not a crepe cake. It\u2019s a really complicated desert which takes hours to make. When my mother done it for the first time it took almost the whole day. If some guest finished medovik just because they greedy and had no idea where to stop, I would be mad too.", "ESH youre friends are AHs except Nina and you kinda suck too only because you had 6 (3 there + 3 you took home) slices taking that last 1 was just over the top", "YTA", "N T A for eating but taking half of it home and not leaving them with any leftovers? Seriously YTA for that.", "You are NTA. I'm part russian myself and if someone eating that much cake and food. My family would be happy cause no leftovers and a happy visitor. When she likes the last piece of cake than the need to say that. It's not your fault when she didn't react. Yeah maybe you eat a bit much cake but when the grandma did it. I can tell she is happy that you are happy from here cake. When every body got a piece and didn't want the last pieces where is the problem. When it was a family NYE then there was russian family who can make this cake self. So when they didn't want more cake than eat.\n\nAnd maybe just tell nina you didn't know that she loves the last piece and say you can split or something like that.\n\nEdit.\nWhy do i get down votes?\nI'm just telling my perspective.\nI know every body is different.\nBut from the Russian family's i know.\nIf you eat much they are very happy.\nIf you ask if they can give you some of the food with you for later. They gone be happy", "NTA, but inconsiderate imo. If I'm invited to eat cake and already had three slices I would never take so many slices home. Even if it was offered (russian hospitality) you should probably only have taken one slice home or none at all.", "YTA, being a guest at a home is kind of like being treated out to dinner.  You don\u2019t order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, at a home you don\u2019t blatantly overindulge, in a restaurant you don\u2019t order multiple desserts, at a home you don\u2019t eat half the cake.  \n\nAlthough Nina\u2019s family was \u201csuper welcoming\u201d I\u2019m sure by the night it wearing thin,  pigging out on the cake and hogging the leftovers was icing on the cake.  If I was Nina your invitation would be permanently revoked.", "No one gives a shit about your body or body shaming you. It\u2019s rude to be so greedy. A lot of cultures have the offer guests food tradition but you\u2019re not actually supposed to eat all the food and the kitchen sink. Read the room. YTA.", "NTA\nYou should have shared the cake with Nina, but honestly, whether to accept food or not is one of  those huge cultural pitfalls you need to research before.", "NTA - food was freely offered to all. If Nina wanted leftover cake, she could have taken the last slice.", "NTA. You knew what you wanted, you spoke up when everyone else was silent. If she wanted the leftover cake, she should have said yes herself and then saved it herself. Her grandmother probably felt so happy that you were enthusiastic and enjoying her food/dessert.", "NTA as someone from eastern europe myself i can assure you the grandma was definitievely very happy you liked her food and took some for home.\n\nIt is actually culturally offensive to reject offered food when you're invited somewhere.\n\nYour roomates have no word in what you eat nor how much it was def not their buisness, they're just jealous you enjoyed yourself.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with being enthusiastic about food that someone else cooked", "NTA\n\nI just think it's super weird that there's this unspoken, unwritten expectation that you're not supposed to eat or take the food that someone is offering you. It's like a trick and if you don't choose the right thing, you're an asshole. The sooner we can dispense with such stupid, wasteful traditions the better! \n\nI only think you're a little bit of an asshole for not sharing the cake after you found out your friend wanted some. Though I've been scratching my head over why your friend didn't just speak up when the leftovers were being offered if she wanted it so bad?", "NTA\n\nNever ever turn down good food!

But if you eat that much during dinner, then it's polite not to bring home the leftovers! Or at least be REALLY sure that nobody wants them. Which mean you have to actually give the opportunity to others, because if you rush to take the leftovers, of course the hosts + other guests would feel uncomfortable blocking you. You have to wait for the hosts to explicitly ask if someone wants the leftovers (sometimes there is so much leftovers that would be wasted especially if the hosts are just a couple or a single person; other times, especially if it's a bigger family, leftovers can be easily eaten the following day). At that point, wait a bit to see if some guests are interested as well and if you taking leftovers is an actual offer.\n\nAlso, you live with Nina.

Where the fuck are your manners?", "Soft YTA. Did you grow up with food insecurities? Like was there not enough food at home? Do you not have enough food know? \n\nThey were being polite and you took advantage of their hospitality. You shouldn't be stuffing yourself and then taking home all their left overs.

Ever heard of \"common sense\"? YTA", "YTA. Everything seemed ok to me until you packed FOUR slices of cake to take home with you after already eating three. That\u2019s a little overboard, my guy.", "YTA. You had 7 slices of the cake ?! How big & tiered was it ? Was there enough of slice to feed at least 1 slice per guest ? Did you already bag 3 slices in a Tupperware while not everyone was served once ??  I'm curious how it went. Did they see you do that ?", "YTA that\u2019s bad manners as a guest.

YTA and I would not be surprised if they never invite you again", "NTA For the first part. Grandma cultures (as I like to call them) typically want you to eat more than you are comfortable eating. So being enthusiastic about dinner was most likely welcome. \n\nAH for the part where your friend mentioned her favorite part was leftover cake, and you didn't immediately give half your stash to her.", "I\u2019m gonna go with the unpopular NTA. As someone who dated a former Soviet, I know the pressure to eat and drink at these gatherings. I generally do not eat much, but any family gatherings I was pressured to eat and eat more and more. I\u2019ve literally been shamed for putting too little on my plate or declining seconds. It can be considered rude to say no. It\u2019s a fine cultural dance and honestly, the food is so good so\u2026 maybe use as a learning experience to hold back next time? Also, why didn\u2019t you give the left over cake to the granddaughter?", "NTA - If grandma made the food she can damn well give it to whomever she wants.

It seems like your friends were judging you for having a good time.", "NTA Eastern European here (not Russian) it's common Knowle that babushka life goal is to over feed everybody - you eating this all and taking stuff home means for us that the food was amazing and you needed it - belive me the grandma will now insist to feed this polite guest forever and be proud that you loved the food.", "NTA, your \u201cfriends\u201d are definitely food/body shaming you, who the heck complains about people eating food at party, especially if they\u2019re offered.

And it's typical that hosts will offer many times over, not to make you feel guilty or forced, but again, to appear as good and hospitable hosts. It also isn't uncommon for people to decline the first time but accept the second time, if only to seem like a gracious guest.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s ok to say no thank you after 2nd time offered, but what really made you the AH was the Tupperware, what is wrong with you? You should buy a cake for Nina, did you at least bring a hostess gift?", "YTA. The problem isn\u2019t how much you ate in my opinion, the problem is that you grabbed FOUR slices of the cake to take home, which was literally the entire leftover cake. The grandmother also offered the cake around, presumably, for someone to eat while there if they still wanted not to stash half the cake to take home", "With the food that you ate, there was absolutely no issue. You were offered on it, and you took it up. That's completely fine. But I think you crossed a line when you packed the slices of cake to take home. You do not do that. If they give you a packed takeaway, only then you take such a thing home. Else, that food doesn't belong to you. So for that, YTA.", "You're so embarrassing ew", "YTA Seven, SEVEN pieces of cake. That is so selfish and greedy. They were probably counting on leftovers to feed them for days but greedy you ate the lot.", "Yes. Many cultures will offer you food as a polite sign of hospitality,  even if they go hungry afterwards. My mother said that during the depression, they would go visit neighbors sometimes.  Inevitably, as a child, she would be offered a plate of cookies.  Her mother told her on the way there that she must refuse politely,  and if she was asked again, she could accept,  but only ONE, since she was probably eating one of the children's cookies after that.", "Tbh you needed to be food shamed. 7 slices is absolutely ridiculous", "YTA.", "Sorry but YTA. You really should have kept in mind this isn't your family and portion sizes. I would be pissed if my bub (my Russian grandma) made her special foods and my friend didn't leave any for anyone else.", "Ok unless you live under a rock specifically in America, YTA. I\u2019ve been in situations where I was told it was rude to refuse seconds and tried to find a second or third stomach (like a cow) to be able to pack it in. But this is willful ignorance. Especially on the leftover front. You have to watch the people around you if you aren\u2019t sure what to do in a cultural situation. And even having been fortunate enough to experience so many cultures and families around the world, you never take half the goddamn cake home. Ever. Wtf.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m autistic so it\u2019s possible I\u2019ve misunderstood the social cues. But here\u2019s my understanding of how food at social events works:\n\nWhen you don\u2019t want to eat more- you never just say no to food because that might be seen as rude or insulting the food. So if you are full, then you say that the food was lovely but you couldn\u2019t possibly eat any more since you are stuffed. If they insist, you can suggest that you might have some later when your meal has digested a bit more but you can\u2019t possibly manage any more of the wonderful food. In some cultures, they will keep offering you food even if that means the host doesn\u2019t have enough for themselves, until you say no. Because it\u2019s seen as rude to underfeed guests. So it\u2019s important to be able to say no to food politely.\n\nWhen you do want to eat more- notice how much other people are eating and don\u2019t eat more than that. If everyone is having two slices of cake, then you can eat two slices. Otherwise you end up eating more than your share and it is rude and unfair to others. If you are still hungry and no one else is eating more than you are, you can say how it tasted so good that you\u2019re tempted to have another slice and then wait for someone to encourage you to eat another slice. Don\u2019t accept straight away. Then you say you would feel naughty or greedy or that you would feel bad eating more than your share when no one else has eaten more than two. And then you hope that someone else also eats a third slice with you or someone keeps persuading you that it is fine to eat more and reassurance that everyone else has had enough so eating more is fine. I\u2019m guessing this is where you went wrong- you kept eating more that other people without doing the things to check it was really okay to keep eating more portions and that the extra portions weren\u2019t just being offered out of politeness.\n\nLeftovers- do not take leftovers unless the host directly offers leftovers. If they do, make sure that everyone else also gets a fair share of leftovers or at least a chance to refuse leftovers to take home. You should not have been taking home 3 slices of cake while others weren\u2019t taking home any cake.\n\nIt\u2019s not about body shaming or food shaming you. It\u2019s about weird social rules around food and you breaking those rules.", ">d I got mad at them for food shaming me\n\nI have no idea what food shaming is, but you ate 3 slices of cake, brought 4 home, and then refused to share any of the 4 slices you brought home with Nina, whose family made the cake, and who invited you.\n\n7 SLICES OF CAKE! SEVEN! And you did not share any of the 4 extra you brought. \n\nIs this food shaming? If it is, there is nothing wrong with it.\n\nOf course YTA.", "INFO What were Tina and Alex getting offered and how much much were they getting?", "I feel like you accepted the food to not sound rude, even if you didn't want it, right?", "YTA for taking a lot of the cake.  That was rude.  It is not rude to eat what is offered though.", "> It was so good I ate 3 slices and put 3 more slices in a Tupperware to take home\n\nInfo, you brought your own tupperware? You put slices in a tupperware yourself before being offered?", "YTA- you went overboard.", "YTA. You took SIX slices of cake. They weren't shaming your body; they were shaming you for being selfish and greedy. You took way more than you should have. You're just trying to make yourself look like the victim but you're not. You're an asshole.", "YTA for taking that much cake home just for yourself.  You're greedy.", "YTA - I think we have a winner for the best food post of the year 2023 already.", " NTA, they offered. You accepted.", "Gonna go against the grain and say NTA here.\n\nYou were in an unfamiliar setting and didn't know their traditions. There's all kinds of warnings out there about things certain cultures see as rude, one of the big ones is not accepting offered gifts. In Native American culture for instance rejecting an offered gift is an insult of the highest order.\n\nI can easily see you sitting there thinking \"The more I show I love it, the better\" if your friends really had an issue they should have been good friends and pulled you aside to TELL YOU. \n\nIf you really did hear her talking about wanting leftover cake, you absolutely should have insisted on leaving some, but as a new face in a gathering from a culture you don't understand, the people here crucifying you (and your friends) need to chill out. Rejecting the food would have pissed off as many cultures as taking the food would.\n\nExpecting people unfamiliar with a culture to act perfectly, and roasting them for not knowing better, is the real asshole move\n\nEdit: Comments by literal Russians and Eastern Europeans are getting downvoted for trying to explain this in terms of the culture. Are you all saying YTA because you think she did the wrong thing culturally or are you doing it because you want to trash her eating habits?", "You need to accept you have children as roommates, get out", "NTA for eating what was offered to you but you pretty much are for hogging a whole cake to yourself even after your friend lamented not getting any. Unless the food is offered to be divided up by the host and taken home by guests you NEVER fill a Tupperware container at someone else\u2019s house.", "A soft YTA. While Nina was a little passive aggressive in her approach, if you had just offered her the cake in the car there would have been peace. A quick, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you enjoyed leftover cake so much, here you go!\u201d Would have solved a lot", "ESH-they have no right to food shame you and make rude glances about how much food you ate, it's not their business, if it's offered, it's free game. She also doesn't really get to complain if there was a piece that was offered around and she refused it. \n\nBUT taking 3-4 extra pieces is a bit on the greedy side, taking one extra piece and the piece that no one else wanted should be enough next time, if there is a next time with how they're acting.", "How she the asshole when her friend's grandmother offer the cake and nobody wanted it? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and the grandmother told OP she can eat all she want so I\u2019m trying to figure out how OP is the asshole\ud83e\udd14 and tbh OP friends are the real asshole for side-eyed her like it was a problem for her to be eating.. \nat this point everyone who\u2019s saying she the asshole, y\u2019all are the asshole", "Exactly.

I was actually with OP all the way till they they said they took all the leftovers cake slices even if no one said they wanted it. My culture is also big on offering guests as much food as possible and even offer to pack the rest but damn OP use your common sense and leave something for the rest of them. Just because someone says no to leftovers , specially if asked in front of everyone) you can certainly be sure someone is eying it but too shy or polite to say yes outright (and this is coming from someone who tells you what she wants and thinks when asked but even I would have said no to the remaining slices). \n\nYTA op and read the room, girl", "As someone from eastern Europe I disagree here. Every party we have or had there is one rule. Table must be empty when guests are leaving. And if it is not empty guests can take it whit them.

Sub guy was 3 years ago!!?", "This is the part that leaves no room for misunderstanding. OP knew their friend was disappointed not to have leftover cake, OP has THREE slices of cake in their bag and doesn\u2019t give any to their friend?! WTH is wrong with you, OP LOL like damn", "I live in a country which has pretty similar customs. I would like to say that there is nothing wrong with how much she ate at the table (maybe except the cake). During celebrations slavics have mentality that there would be not enough food so we make loads of it. Literally loads. After a celebration, there is a massive amount of leftovers left and you have to live on them for a week at least. And even then, you still throw away a lot of food. So if someone us eating a lot at the table - there is no issue.\nNow  onto the cake. If there is one cake, you usually have one slice or two. You try to make sure that there is a leftover cake for the hosts so they  an enjoy it next day. Especially homemade traditional cake since they need \"sitting\" - some cakes taste best 3 days after making them. Then you take into account if there is enough cake left for close family members for take away. But slavics can be pretty persistant - so you usually agree to take one slice when you are about to leave the house. And if you ate quite a big portion of the cake already - you politely refuse and tell that maybe you will take upon that offer next time.\n\nI am not sure if OP's roomate's family is similar but this is how it goes here. And we are pretty close to Russia. Either way - YTA for the cake alone.", "Yeah i was thinking the same. We are always offering but to be honest in my 24 years nobody had eat this much in my house or my parents house.", ">They are Slavic, they will offer you food until they have none.\n\nI work with a Polish woman and we're all permanently WFH, but sometimes we hire an office space for a day. She will bring in some home made food (always amazing, last time it was sausage rolls and they were the best I've ever had), then she will go to a shop, and buy some sweets/cakes etc and give them to us all.\n\nIt's super sweet and we all insist she doesn't need to, of course she will anyway, but damn if I was at her house I would never take every single piece of cake.", "Right.
