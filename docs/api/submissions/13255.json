My dad worked several jobs and so did our adoptive mom. My adoptive mom (step mom who adopted us) came from even less. Her dad (our grandfather) died a brutal death by prison guards and it was tragic. My family sued and won an incredibly large settlement. \n\nMy mom and dad have regularly asked what they should do with the money. I told my mom she should travel the world, retire, and do the things she has always wanted to do. My dad wants to also buy a house on the country side where they can quietly retire. And I believe whatever is left should be split down the middle between my sister and I.\n\nI\u2019m not wealthy myself but my partner and I get by. My partner is disabled and we would benefit from the inheritance in terms of affording things like IVF, a baby, and making that dream come true. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t seem like we really could afford a child like we would want to. \n\nMy sister disagrees. She believes that since she has kids, and I don\u2019t, it should go to her kids. My problem with this is that my sister has struggled all throughout her life with addictions. My parents and I both have bailed her out financially so many times. I\u2019ve stepped in and raised my nieces and nephews at moments and have had to pay for school supplies, piano lessons, etc. (She has four kids and another on the way). And I honestly feel that if I didn\u2019t have to step in and parent her kids at an early age myself, I might be able to better afford my own child. \n\nThings were civil about these discussions until my sister and her husband keep harassing me and my fianc\u00e9e. Saying that we are selfish. That we are taking their money. And that the money is meant for the kids. My sister even sometimes tells me that my dad plans on just giving all of the money to grand kids. I brought this up with my parents and they said this wasn\u2019t true. That the plan is actually to give my sisters share to her kids and my share to me. I haven\u2019t told my sister that I know this. \n\nMy sister has started telling people in their town that I\u2019m greedy, I hate my family, and that my partner and I don\u2019t need the money since we don\u2019t have kids. She\u2019s even started shaming my partner and the temporary work she has found over the years as a disabled person. And went so far as to say I should\u2019ve considered money when I chose to get engaged to a disabled woman and implying my fianc\u00e9e is lazy. My sister feels as if I shouldn\u2019t take half because that leaves smaller shares for her children. \n\nAITA for standing my ground and asking for my share of the inheritance?", "created_utc": 1679851491, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122t6hl/aita_for_asking_that_my_share_of_the_inheritance/", "score": 939, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since your parents have stated their desire to leave your sisters half to her kids, they need to talk to a proper iht advisor for help with the will and setting up any trusts necessary.

Assuming there is money left when they die (and kudoes to you, OP, for recognizing that your right to any money does not attach while your parents are alive, and that they have the right to spend it all during their lifetimes), it strikes me that your parents need to discuss establishing a trust for your sister's children, so that your sister cannot get her hands on any money your parents leave to them. I would advise, for your own mental health, that you NOT be the trustee; in this case, if the estate is large enough to warrant it, your parents should choose a professional trustee for your sister's children. Many banks provide this service. It isn't free, but it's worth the relatively small percentage of assets the bank/trustee charges to keep everything professional and to stay out of that part of your sister's life.\n\nAnd, obviously, ignore whatever your sister says about you.
