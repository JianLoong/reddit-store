My dad worked several jobs and so did our adoptive mom. My adoptive mom (step mom who adopted us) came from even less. Her dad (our grandfather) died a brutal death by prison guards and it was tragic. My family sued and won an incredibly large settlement. \n\nMy mom and dad have regularly asked what they should do with the money. I told my mom she should travel the world, retire, and do the things she has always wanted to do. My dad wants to also buy a house on the country side where they can quietly retire. And I believe whatever is left should be split down the middle between my sister and I.\n\nI\u2019m not wealthy myself but my partner and I get by. My partner is disabled and we would benefit from the inheritance in terms of affording things like IVF, a baby, and making that dream come true. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t seem like we really could afford a child like we would want to. \n\nMy sister disagrees. She believes that since she has kids, and I don\u2019t, it should go to her kids. My problem with this is that my sister has struggled all throughout her life with addictions. My parents and I both have bailed her out financially so many times. I\u2019ve stepped in and raised my nieces and nephews at moments and have had to pay for school supplies, piano lessons, etc. (She has four kids and another on the way). And I honestly feel that if I didn\u2019t have to step in and parent her kids at an early age myself, I might be able to better afford my own child. \n\nThings were civil about these discussions until my sister and her husband keep harassing me and my fianc\u00e9e. Saying that we are selfish. That we are taking their money. And that the money is meant for the kids. My sister even sometimes tells me that my dad plans on just giving all of the money to grand kids. I brought this up with my parents and they said this wasn\u2019t true. That the plan is actually to give my sisters share to her kids and my share to me. I haven\u2019t told my sister that I know this. \n\nMy sister has started telling people in their town that I\u2019m greedy, I hate my family, and that my partner and I don\u2019t need the money since we don\u2019t have kids. She\u2019s even started shaming my partner and the temporary work she has found over the years as a disabled person. And went so far as to say I should\u2019ve considered money when I chose to get engaged to a disabled woman and implying my fianc\u00e9e is lazy. My sister feels as if I shouldn\u2019t take half because that leaves smaller shares for her children. \n\nAITA for standing my ground and asking for my share of the inheritance?", "created_utc": 1679851491, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122t6hl/aita_for_asking_that_my_share_of_the_inheritance/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father should tell your sister about the decision as well. Do not involve yourself in this!

That was her choice.   Ask her if you have kids later will she give some back to you?  \n\nYou should say \u201cactually I do need the money so we can plan kids, because it would be terribly irresponsible to have kids without the financial means to do so\u201d.

It does depend on where you are but in general in the absense of a Will, following the death of the surviving spouse the money would most likely be split equally between the surviving children. Your sister having children of her own is only relevant when dividing her own estate, and has no bearing on this at all. Since your parents have stated their desire to leave your sisters half to her kids, they need to talk to a proper iht advisor for help with the will and setting up any trusts necessary. I really recomend that everything be put in place well in advance of your parents deaths  as your sister sounds like a harpy and she will 100% make your life even more miserable when the time comes. I am sorry that you have to experience this, unfortunately some people just can't handle greed and it ruins both them and their relationships with everyone around them.", "NTA \n\nIn the end it\u2019s up to your parents and your sister is entitled for wanting it all.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYour sister is a greedy and bitter person who is apparently bad with money, too... and should be happy you two each get a share, not try to harass you and your parents into getting even more. Stand your ground and fulfill your dreams. Her having kids (and a lot of them, too. Use a condom if you can't afford children!) when she's not able to provide for them without your help and then thinking that entitles her to getting even MORE help without having to work for it... sorry, she's the only AH in all of this.\n\nAlso, I'm genuinely happy you support your parents in fulfilling their dreams instead of being jealous and hoping for a bigger share - you're a good person. I really hope they won't give in to her outrageous demands. Be open with them, tell them what she's doing and saying... and all the best to you and your partner in the future!", "ESH. It sounds like this money currently belongs to your mother or your mother & father. There is no \u201cstanding your ground\u201d and asking for \u201cyour share\u201d.  What happens with the money is up to your parents, not you. It\u2019s very entitled of you & your sister to be fighting about someone else\u2019s money. It\u2019s not clear if you & she think mom should turn over some of the money now, or if you\u2019re talking about what the two of you will inherit when mom & dad are both dead. If you\u2019re asking for life advice, I\u2019d say you & your sister should live your lives like there is no inheritance. Live the lives you can pay for on your own. I suppose it depends on how much money there is, but houses in the country, worldwide travel & a couple of decades of retirement are expensive, especially if one of your parents needs ongoing medical care or end of life care.", "NTA of course. I really love your parent's decision to give her share straight to the grandchildren and your share to you. I know being an addict is a life long issue and she may be currently clean, but this manic behavior over money that isn't even hers yet is super sus. In what world would she get the entire inheritance and you get nothing simply because you don't have kids? Why isn't what she (thought) she was getting enough? When your parents could opt to give her and her kids $0. \nShe's acting like a fiend going around town foaming at the month about someone else's pocketbook.  And what type of monster mocks someone's ability to work? Or their disability status?

They could leave it all to the local humane society to buy solid gold cat beds, and that would be their prerogative.

You are all talking as if your parents are already dead and your sister is arguing with you about an inheritance that you don't have. If your parents have any sense, they'll burn through the lot having a good time and donate the rest.", "NTA. It seems like you have done a lot for your sister, nephews, and nieces. Splitting it down the middle is fair and the way omit should be. Also, if your sister is still doing drugs, a huge pile of money like this could be dangerous for her. Having the money in a trust for your sister where she can only access so much at a time may be beneficial. The trust  could be setup for colleges for her kids, down payment on housing, and monthly stipends. It's really easy to spend a lot of money quickly. I hope you and your partner love a wonderful life.", "Nta!  We have 2 kids and our estate is 50/50 split", "How are you even doubting? Assuming your tale is true, not having children doesn\u2019t get sister a greater share.

I guarantee if your roles were reversed she would be fighting against your imaginary children inheriting. \n\nOne generation inheritance is best. My husband\u2019s inheritance from his grandfather went to 3 generations (over 70 people) and was a legal & personal nightmare that took years & years to finalize. An incredible amount money was spent on legal fees. Hopefully your parents stand with you. Good luck OP!", "NTA. It's understandable that you want to ensure that your share of the inheritance is respected and that your nieces and nephews get your sister's portion, not yours.

I wouldn\u2019t let your sister know anything either. I go as far as asking your parents to lie to her to shut her up. She can cry about it when the time comes.", "NTA - but I don't understand why you are arguing about this.   Neither of you have any control over what happens to the money until it's in your bank account.", "Since your parents have told you that you are going to get your share, I'm not really sure what you are asking as to why you might be an a******. Unfortunately, you are not going to be able to control what your sister says or what other people believe. You can only control how you respond to her and anyone else. It's best done calmly and matter of factly, and not engaging in trying to prove anything or make yourself look innocent, even though you are.", "ESH cause It's your parent's money and this seems like it's something they get to decide.
