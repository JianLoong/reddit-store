I had looked into this already, but ruled it out. Partly because the financial upside (in our part of the world/current economic climate) didn\u2019t look to be great for the effort involved, and partly because I\u2019m not morally comfortable with the idea of being a landlord. I\u2019m not extreme in this view, and think there is probably a place for private landlords, but it\u2019s something I\u2019d avoid putting upon myself when I have better alternatives available. \n\nI explained all of this, and BIL essentially blew up; I had no idea, but apparently his whole end goal is to make enough money to buy enough rental properties to make that his full time occupation.

I told him that he has no idea of the value of money, that he\u2019s the product of immense privilege, has never paid his own bills, and only has a business because of daddy\u2019s input and bankrolling. \n\nAt this point my MIL and FIL called time on dinner and suggested that we leave. We\u2019ve never butted heads like that as a family before, so I think it came as a shock to everyone. \n\nMy wife gets my point and is glad I stood up for her autonomy, but wishes I\u2019d tried harder to keep the peace.
