I had looked into this already, but ruled it out. Partly because the financial upside (in our part of the world/current economic climate) didn\u2019t look to be great for the effort involved, and partly because I\u2019m not morally comfortable with the idea of being a landlord.

We\u2019ve never butted heads like that as a family before, so I think it came as a shock to everyone. \n\nMy wife gets my point and is glad I stood up for her autonomy, but wishes I\u2019d tried harder to keep the peace.

Trying to read eg. the history of castes in India or the very different racial dynamics in China as identical to America's history of chattel slavery and its long-term impact is trying to force a square peg into a round hole.\n\nAnd my presumption is that we're talking about America here, in any case, where the incentives are as I described.  The outlook described in this thread could occur anywhere but the specific example *is* somewhat American in nature, partially because of that highly-specific history - an asshole in China, Qatar, or India is more likely to justify themselves in another way.  So saying \"ah, that is a belief common among a certain type of white American\" is not inaccurate even though it's a generalization.\n\n(Of course it's important to remember that it's still a generalization - especially as the world becomes more interconnected, such beliefs can spread, and as mentioned, sure, people in other parts of the world *can* believe those things.  But not all bad things are the same; how people justify hierarchy and the points which they feel they have to explain away differ, overall, from region to region and culture to culture.)", "Thanks for that explanation, I appreciate it."]}
