We got engaged last year. Our relationship is pretty good. I just have one issue: his family from his father\u2019s side. Starting with his dad, he is a pathological liar, an abuser and a terrible father. He cheated on my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom during the whole marriage and (TW: abused psychologically and physically of her, to the point she ran away from him with his two children, my fianc\u00e9 and his sister). \n\nTime passed and my fianc\u00e9 tried to forgive his father (which he did) and got in contact with him again. This happened while my fianc\u00e9 and I just moved in together. During this time, his dad used to ask for money all the time and since I was in a better economical position than my fianc\u00e9 at that time, I used to be the one lending him money for whatever he needed. But, he got mad anytime I asked for my money back. I stopped lending him money and told my fianc\u00e9 his dad was just using him. He just didn\u2019t believe me and continued lending him money. However, money was not the only thing he would ask for. He was asking for favors ALL the time: using our things, our car, our streaming services, asking me to take care of one of his children, buying food and other things for him\u2026 and more. \n\nOne day I got tired of it and refused to do any more favors, this because I realized he was talking lots of mean things about me with my fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex (I saw some TikToks they both posted and both were making fun of my looks and clapping at each other\u2019s jokes about me). Also, his dad was liking -18 content of teens dancing and he was making very nasty comments about them. I showed all this to my fianc\u00e9 which made him quite disappointed and made him confront his dad about it. His dad just said he wasn\u2019t doing anything bad and that he had the right to say whatever he wanted. My fianc\u00e9 immediately cut him off and we both took distance from him, which made him really mad and he started to bad mouthing us, to the point all his family called us and texted us to tell us we were horrible people. So, after this, all his family has ever done since then is to hate me without any reason and they haven\u2019t even met me yet. \n\nHis family came to visit for Christmas and I told my fianc\u00e9 I wouldn\u2019t like to be around the house due to all of this. I told him they are more than welcome to say hello and all that but I would not allowed them to stay let alone spend Christmas with us. He said I am being rude and impolite and that I should not care. I said he could do whatever he wants to but I wouldn\u2019t be in the house when they are here. So, I did. I texted him and asked him to let me know when they were gone. Now, my fianc\u00e9 is quite mad at me because I didn\u2019t let his family meet me for the very first time in person. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701551018, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189d3sw/aita_for_leaving_the_house_when_my_fianc\u00e9s_family/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
