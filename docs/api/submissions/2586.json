She made a choice to dance with you. You didn't know anything about her marital status. NTA", "NTA\n\nShe isn't his property. They are separated. Whatever she does is none of his business.", "NTA. As far as you're concerned, you asked a stranger to dance, she accepted, you both had a good time and then decided to exchange numbers to see where it might go from there. You did nothing wrong.\n\nMore importantly, the woman in question isn't anyone's property. She's separated from her husband. He doesn't own her. If she accepts a dance with someone and decides to hand out her number, then that's on her. That macho \"lose her number\" threat from her ex will be *exactly* the reason why he's her ex in the first place.", "NTA. Dancing at a wedding really isn\u2019t inappropriate at all. It shouldn\u2019t matter if she was recently separated or if her ex husband was there. If she thought it was inappropriate she would have declined your offer to dance.", "How long after the separation until one is Allowed to dance?", "NTA. That ex-husband guy is an asshole and creep. He has absolutely no say over what you or his ex does.\n\n>She told me that I probably shouldn\u2019t be dancing with someone who was so recently separated.\n\nYour sister's an asshole too. That she's recently separated doesn't mean she has to be treated as an outcast...", "Nta. I get why he doesn't want to see his ex dancing with someone else, but it is no longer anything to do with him", "NTA/ you had no clue he was there. And even so, she agreed. Unless you know him personally and have some kind of loyalties to him, it\u2019s fair game. And anyways\u2026it\u2019s HER choice. No one else\u2019s.", "NTA. What, she\u2019s not allowed to make a decision for herself? Her ex husband has veto power on her relationship building?\n\nDon\u2019t second guess yourself. You asked a beautiful woman by herself to dance and she agreed. You liked each other and exchanged numbers. Her ex partner should have absolutely no impact on her choices.", "NTA.  The woman you asked certainly could have declined.  She could have declined to exchanged numbers.  The ex doesn\u2019t get to dictate who his now ex gets to dance with or talk to.  The scene is indeed unfortunate but not your responsibility.\n\nWould I get in a romantic relationship with someone very recently separated?  No but that is because they need time.\n\nDoes your sister have a recommendation on soon is too soon to dance?   A week?  A month?  Six months?", "Nta. People aren't property", "NTA\n\nYou asked someone to dance, they clarified it was just dancing, you were good with that.  No foul.", "NTA. The couples\u2019 issues are between them. You asked a solo woman to dance and she said yes, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.", "NTA, she's a separated woman who has an interest. I would personally be friends for a while and get to know each other until there are more divorce papers filled out before trying to get romantically involved just in case the ex tries something, but you're not wrong for dancing with an attractive woman.", "NTA. How were you supposed to know?", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t get to dictate what his ex does, she\u2019s her own person who chose to dance with you and if he wants to be a piss baby about it that\u2019s his choice, but he can be a piss baby off on the corner by himself and keep his mouth shut about his opinion.", "NTA\n\nDon't know why they separated but she's not in a relationship with him any longer and needs to mind his own business.", "NTA they're separated. And it's probably because of his jealousy/insecurity issues...", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe you have to even ask the question.", "NTA. First of all you didn\u2019t know she was recently separated. Second, she\u2019s a grown woman and is allowed to dance if she wants to regardless of how her ex might feel about it.", "NTA. Nevermind that they're separated, they could still be married and at the end of the day the only person who can decide who to dance with is her.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know he was there", "NTA\n\nDancing a few songs with someone is perfectly acceptable regardless of their marriage status.\n\nShe was honest about her being recently single.\n\nPeople are allowed to dance and have fun, no one has the right to police that.", "NTA\n\nThe only \"scene\" here was the fault of the soon-to-be ex and possibly the woman with whom you danced. She could have told you he was present, she could have said no, etc. He could have taken it up with her. Basically you are the only here that isn't in the wrong IMO.", "NTA.  It was just a dance.  If she actually enjoyed your company you probably made her night better.  It\u2019s awkward af to be in the same function with a recent ex and good company is appreciated", "NTA!!\nIt\u2019s just a freaking dance for God\u2019s sake!! She told you she\u2019s separated and regardless of that fact neither of you did anything wrong! It\u2019s not like you went to dinner.. or you fell so in love you IMMEDIATELY dropped on one knee and asked her to marry you that instant or the instant her divorce was final!! \n\nGod! The standard set for women that are separated SUCKS. The guys can do whatever the heck they want but if a woman even danced with someone she\u2019s a criminal?! What is this?! 1950?! Is she supposed to don a habit and hide in a corner?! Neither of you did anything wrong. Ex being there or not.", "NTA", "NTA- she must have enjoyed your company or she wouldn\u2019t have given you her number. Be a friend to her, maybe it will develop into something maybe it won\u2019t, but there is no reason you can\u2019t be a good friend", "NTA  her STBE he doesn\u2019t seem to be taking the \u201cex\u201d part very well. It was a dance. You make her night. You found her attractive and enjoyed her company. She probably needed the positive attention.", "NTA. You danced a couple times, not got a hotel room. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.", "Nta - call her up and be the next best partner in her life!", "NTA \n\nYou danced. That's it.

It was none of her ex's business.", "NTA... but I hope you can defend yourself.... this might escalate if you date her, and the guy can get information about you through his friend.", "NTA. \n\nBased on this story, you literally has no way of knowing this person\u2019s ex was even at the wedding, or even knew she was recently separated when you asked her to dance. What should you have done, according to your sister? Say \u201coh well, if you\u2019re recently separated I will have to rescind my dance invitation!\u201d That would be unbelievably rude. \n\nBut that\u2019s frankly besides the point anyway. The woman you asked to dance is an autonomous being who can say no if they don\u2019t feel comfortable dancing. Should this woman not be allowed to dance with anyone until her ex-partner deems it okay? Should we be controlled by the feelings of our ex-partners? It\u2019s the same logic as two people being attracted to the same person and one of them calling dibs, like the person they\u2019re attracted to has no say in the matter. It\u2019s a gross and antiquated notion. \n\nNTA at all.", "NTA. She is a big girl who is single and for goodness sake it was just dancing. Seeing the guy's attitude I am not surprised she is separated from him, he seems controling (and be making her life hard). If you like her call her, and if she is happy to to see you again then why not. It doesn't have to be anything serious, maybe just a coffee.", "NTA Unless the dancing included a horisontal tango right in the middle of the dance floor, it's nobody's business who you or she dance with. Don't lose that number", "NTA. It's not like you dry humped her leg like some over excited puppy, you danced and exchanged numbers like two adults capable of making their own decisions.", "NTA. You had no idea who that guy was. You even were polite and offered him a cigarette. If he didn't want to smoke what was he doing? Just going out there to complain that you talked to his ex?", "NTA.  People can't tell you who you can or can't dance with. Same with people's phone numbers he can't tell you to lose her number.\n\n hes miffed because she's leaving. And hes taking it out on you because it's easier than taking it out of unhurt cause they're already separated.", "NTA. STBX is jeleous and doesn't want to be an ex. Which is gonna cause him to be an ex. Sister needs to butt out as they are separated for a reason and it was dancing at a wedding. Not clubbing.", "NTA. Does dance mean something other than the obvious? Because I don\u2019t get the drama.", "NTA You two danced.That's all You didn't have ask for a date. Just a dance. She stated that she was recently separated (which means she isn't emotionally available for any romantic overtones) \nShe gave you her number becuase you were respectful of her and she thought you were nice. \n\nYour sister needs to respect the fact that the women is a adult ans she can make her own decisions. And the ex husband needs to respect that his soon to be ex wife can make her own choices.", "You have nothing to do with her previous marriage and owe nothing to a sad possessive man. NTA and seem pretty smooth.", "NTA. It\u2019s a dance. You were not the reason she separated from her husband", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong except for smoking lol", "Yta. They're divorced yet", "Only the AH for doing it at a wedding where it could have caused significant drama.  Other than that there divorced.", " Well she did tell me she was recently separated.", "NTA. She\u2019s a grown woman and knows how to say no. It was a couple of dances in public. I see why she\u2019s separated.", "At least a year. Unless its International Tango, then a minute should be adequate. /s\n\neta: added /s tag cause there is a joke there, but realized it might not be clear that its all part of it.", "Hahahaha! This!", "I think it\u2019s cause she knows this woman and doesn\u2019t want to see her get hurt again but I\u2019m only guessing.", "I mean I guess cause she did tell me she was recently separated.", "I wish I didn\u2019t but I\u2019m second guessing myself.", "Even if he had known, so what? They are separated. Ex-husband has no say whatsoever.", "NTA, even married people are allowed to dance with others, particularly in plain sight of a crowd full of friends and family. Couldn\u2019t be safer.", "She told you as a warning that she was not emotionally available, not that she did want to dance or wasn't allowed to make her own decisions", "Yes, but she still made the decision to dance with you because SHE wanted to. It was her choice to accept or decline, she chose to accept. Her decision was hers and hers alone, just as it was to exchange numbers.", "So? She was much more aware of the details of the situation than you. It was her choice. People are acting like you just picked up an object belonging to another man rather than a woman with free will who obviously and willingly accepted your request to dance. Any issue her ex has with her choice to dance is between her and her ex.", "So? She told you she wasn't looking for anything but still danced with you. You didn't force her, nor did you force her to give you her number (at least it doesn't sound like you did). NTA, although it might be a good idea to lose her number anyway, if only because the ex sounds like a jealous psycho.", "So, like\u2026 a nice waltz?", "It was her choice to dance with you, and her choice to give you her number.

Your sister was completely out of line saying what she did.\n\nNTA", "I totally agree that the ex husband has no say whatsoever. But I still feel like it\u2019s dick move to exchange numbers with someone right in front of their ex if you know their ex is right there and watching. Hence why not knowing it was the ex makes it not an AH move", "Also, why the whole life story when justa asked to dance? Overkill on her side too.", "mmmm still might be too provocative... \ud83d\ude09\n\n...when I was taking ballroom classes in college (for fun) one of the instructors analogized the different styles of tango as:\n\nAmerican tango: teens dating\n\nArgentine: Newlyweds on their honeymoon\n\nInternational: Married 30 years and only still together for the kids", "Gotcha", "Some partners have agreed during the separation process that they\u2019re not allowed to see/sleep with other people until the divorce is finalised.
