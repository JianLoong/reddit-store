You asked her. She said yes. If there was some reason she shouldn\u2019t dance with you, then she should/would have told you.\n\nAnyway she can decide to accept your or not. Everyone else is just being weird.", "Nta. Pretty sure the grown woman who agreed to dance and enjoyed your company is all you need to know. Her husband has no ownership of her. Even if they weren\u2019t separated. If she wanted to dance with you and enjoyed it then her marital situation has nothing to do with you and a dance. Unless you weee boning on the dancefloor. You would be an A then\u2026. Only because it was a non-Dothraki wedding and sex on the dance floor is generally frowned upon no matter who it\u2019s with", "NTA, not like you and her made the beast with 2 backs in the middle of the reception and used his tie to clean up after.", "Nta. How were you supposed to know any of that?", "Are married people no longer allowed to dance with other people in public at weddings? I never got that memo.\n\nNTA, unless there really is a memo I missed about waltzing in full view of an entire banquet hall being cheating all of a sudden", "Not the asshole. You are adults. It sucks and is awkward, but you are adults.", "You should\u2019ve asked him to dance to even it out. Ha.", "Have a little empathy bro.", "THIS! NTA and challenge the ex to a dance-off!", "They're separated. Besides it Doesn't matter she's not the ex's property", "After you were already dancing eah?", "Praise be!", "I never said she's his property. She's technically married and so is he. So they're not divorced yet. If the divorce is finalised, both of them can do whatever they want. But why do I care, your culture are 100 % different than mine so you guys can fuck around wether you're married or not.", "Maybe? But the person you take that up with is your partner. Not the stranger who asked a woman sitting alone if she wanted to dance?", "My husband makes it his mission to dance with every woman who is standing alone at weddings. It's like his move. Grandma's, aunt's, single cousins, whomever. All ages. He wants everyone to feel included and have fun. Everyone dances at weddings, it's totally fine. And she's her own person and gets to decide what she wants to do.", "True but that still means OP is NTA and no one should be mad at him", "Maybe, maybe not. She knows her ex and knew he was there. He could have cut in or done something weird. Heads up sounds normal.", "Well considering the style was developed by the British after they were introduced to the Tango in 1912 it really does make sense.\n\nNTA OP", "Lmaooo I was told dancing leads to kissing, kissing leads to sex, and sex leads to babies, so dancing is a sin\ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019ve never danced with my husband.", "NTA she is not someone else\u2019s property. It would have been WAY WAY more rude for you to ask her to dance and then say never mind when she told you she was recently separated. She\u2019s a grown woman who can make her own choices.", "NTA. How were you supposed to know her ex was present, plus if anyone should feel any obligation to the ex it\u2019s her. If she didn\u2019t, there\u2019s probably a good reason for it.", "Nta. It was a dance! You didn't do anything inappropriate. She could have declined. And furthermore, you didn't know her husband was there, end even if you did, you still did nothing wrong.", "NTA. She told you upfront that it would only be a dance because she knew her ex was there and did not want to create a scene at someone else\u2019s wedding. The fact that he glared at you and followed you to tell you to lose the number means he still feels she belongs to him and she was right to be careful. \n\nYou both had a good time dancing and she liked you enough to give you her number.  If you would like to get to know her and don\u2019t mind the controlling ex I would give it a couple of days and ring and invite her to lunch.", "Even if she was happily married dancing with another persons is not wrong \n\nHaving contact information for a person you met is not wrong. New Relationships do not have to be sexual. \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, secondly the woman had the right to refuse. \n\nAlso, is your sister personally invested in their relationship? May move that\u2019s why she scolded you.", "NTA - they were a few fun dances and an exchange of numbers, which she wanted as well. It wasn\u2019t an invite for a date or to have sex\u2026", "NTA she danced with you you didn\u2019t do anything obscene or force yourself on her. She has probably been long past over him anyway.", "NOT THE ASSHOLE!!!  The ex is/was, and you should call her!  Take it slow......Good luck!", "Nope NTA. She\u2019s a big girl who made the decision to dance with you all by herself.", "You\u2019re NTA everyone deciding what this women should do and not do is!! Don\u2019t lose her number and let her enjoy her life. He seems like the psycho ex.", "NTA\n\nIt was just a dance!  Everyone needs to chill the f out.", "NTA - She wanted to dance with you and exchange numbers. You didn\u2019t force her.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know and she said okay. It was just a couple of dances, not a betrothal ceremony.", "NTA You can dance with anyone who wants to dance with you.", "And you were just supposed to magically know this? And she doesn't get a say in it? NTA, you did nothing wrong", "Well, just imagine you just broke up with your boyfriend and it\u2019s fresh. Now he is exchanging numbers with a girl in front of you.\n\nAnyone can do whatever they want because no one is no one\u2019s property. But it\u2019s still an asshole move.", "also you would have no idea the other guy was there", "What she didn't tell you was that he was there also. NTA, she is.", "Why does your sister think that you would hurt this woman?", "Awwwww that made me smile and pout all the same time. How sweet of him.", "Well her ex was also literally at the same event.", "People often pick up other people at weddings, it's something in the air so it's pretty fair to assume. Also, women are constantly being told not to lead others on through their actions and words, it doesn't seem crazy that if you're asked to dance but are not into anything more that you would say a little something small like this just to make sure all were on the same page, lest she then be blamed for blue balls or something.", "Wait.....dancing is cheating?  My mom danced with me at my cousin's wedding.", "Thanks! Not surprising at all, but appreciate knowing the original source."]}
