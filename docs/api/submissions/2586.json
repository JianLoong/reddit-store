Like, OP asked her to dance, not on a date! Also, who asks for people they never met before to \"have this dance\", specially a slow dance? That's for couples and usually only happens when the party is dead. This screams high-school drama.", "Went to look up examples and yeah, absolutely spot on.

He was perfectly happy for me to dance with one of his buddies, who was a good dancer. (And willing to work with my occasional tendency to try to lead!)

It's crazy to me that the woman even mentioned whether she's looking for relationship or not before the dance... I could understand if she said that after you had a good time and talked a bit.
