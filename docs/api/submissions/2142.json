Then when I was 9 he bailed and left my half siblings lives completely. At this point mom thought the best idea would be for my dad to step up and take over raising my half siblings. But he said no. Mom would try and get me to say I wanted it. I found out later that she had attempted recording us talking so she could play it for dad saying I wanted him to love my siblings and be their dad too.\n\nMy half siblings latched onto the idea and then would say I was selfish for hogging the only dad. When I was young and still bitter over what they said I would tell them I guess they had the loser dad after all and I had the better one, because at least mine didn't abandon me. Mom would ask me to be a grown up about it (I was 9/10 at this point). She told me they'd need me more than ever before.\n\nIt didn't change our relationship. They resent me for having a dad.

They overheard and said they should be going instead of me, that it's not fair I get to do that stuff and then they accused me of rubbing my dad in their face and hogging him. Mom said nothing. Didn't even look bothered by what they were saying so they pushed on. Then I snapped and told them they were annoying brats and didn't deserve shit from dad or me.
