My mom was with my dad, had me, divorced dad after cheating on him and married the guy she cheated with. My half siblings are a result of that marriage. He was a dick and used to encourage them to gloat that they had a better dad, that mom picked him over my dad and that my dad was a giant loser. It led to a lot of hard feelings/arguments. Then when I was 9 he bailed and left my half siblings lives completely. At this point mom thought the best idea would be for my dad to step up and take over raising my half siblings. But he said no. Mom would try and get me to say I wanted it. I found out later that she had attempted recording us talking so she could play it for dad saying I wanted him to love my siblings and be their dad too.\n\nMy half siblings latched onto the idea and then would say I was selfish for hogging the only dad. When I was young and still bitter over what they said I would tell them I guess they had the loser dad after all and I had the better one, because at least mine didn't abandon me. Mom would ask me to be a grown up about it (I was 9/10 at this point). She told me they'd need me more than ever before.\n\nIt didn't change our relationship. They resent me for having a dad. I don't think my dad owes them anything. I don't blame them for what they said when their dad was around but I do find it hypocritical that they got away with saying that shit while I'm expected to coddle them and treat them like they're the most important people in the world.\n\nThey have told dad to abandon me and adopt them, they have destroyed stuff I have made for him, they stole photos from my room at mom's house and stuck their faces on photos of me and my dad. I ended up choosing to stay with dad more and they showed up at his house a few times and demanded to be included because \"he's our dad too!\"\n\nI was at my mom's house yesterday. She called and told me she wanted us to talk. Then she was saying how she heard dad was planning a big trip for the two of us at Christmas and she didn't want me to go because she wanted me to spend at least some time at Christmas with her and my siblings. They overheard and said they should be going instead of me, that it's not fair I get to do that stuff and then they accused me of rubbing my dad in their face and hogging him. Mom said nothing. Didn't even look bothered by what they were saying so they pushed on. Then I snapped and told them they were annoying brats and didn't deserve shit from dad or me. Mom was furious and told me I'm older and should be more understanding of them.
