My(m18) brother(m14) and I had an idea to make things funny, which was that right after my sister blew out the candles on her cake, we would push my sister\u2019s face softly into the cake, but then smear a lot of the cake onto her face.\n\nNow this was all inspired by a couple of YouTube videos my brother saw a couple of days ago and things went well in those videos and people were laughing in them, so we thought this would be a good idea. Well when we actually did it, and finished smearing the cake with our bare hands onto her face, my sister just stood up and was straight up sobbing while cake bits dripped from her face, and everyone in the room was quiet.\n\nA lot more happened after that and our parents are to say the least, really fucking mad at us, and our sister doesn\u2019t even talk to us, but I\u2019ll keep things short.

You flat out assaulted your sister, humiliated her in front of her friends and family and ruined her birthday. Of course you are the asshole the hugest way possible. \n\nYou're an 18 year old adult now. Grow up and start acting like it.", "YTA \nSo you kept smearing the cake on her face while she kept sobbing and you just didn't stop???\n\nYou do realise that the vast majority of the time the reaction to a nasty prank like this is EXACTLY what you saw... its just that then people don't post it on socials.\n\nLife 101: tiktok is not real life.\n\nGo and apologise for ruining her birthday.", "YTA\n\nI am sick of seeing and reading about YouTube/TikTok trends that are essentially bullying. It\u2019s gross.", "YTA - Unless you are very simple minded, you & your brother obviously dislike your sister.", "Of course YTA\n\nSide note, sometimes cakes have wooden dowels in the cake that could really hurt someone.", "YTA\n\nThis wasn't funny, it was mean and downright cruel. You do realize that 99% of these videos on YT are all planned out and staged, right? People aren't going around pushing faces into cakes while everyone stands around laughing like it's a grand old time. \n\nYou two need to grow up. You also need to apologize profusely to your sister and try to do anything you can to make up for it.", "YTA. You bullied your sister in front of everybody on her birthday and you are wondering if that makes you assholes ?\n\nLittle life advice : don't take your ideas from tiktok or Youtube. Try to use your own judgement instead.", "INFO: Have you seen all the videos where it *doesn't* work out and it completely ruins the celebration? Like you guys just did? YTA for doing this for your own amusement and for wasting a perfectly good cake that was bought with someone else's hard earned money.", "YTA, I really wish men your age would understand - PRANKS AREN'T AS FUNNY AS YOU THINK THEY ARE. Most people don't find being humiliated publically enjoyable, and they don't find it enjoyable to watch, either. \n\nRemember how the room reacted when you embarrassed your sister? That's life off of Youtube - people don't really admire the prank guy.", "YTA, both for ruining your sister\u2019s birthday and for not realizing that those \u201cprank\u201d videos are pre-planned.", "Your sister was fucking sobbing, and now refuses to talk to you, do you *really* need to ask if you\u2019re the asshole here? \n\nYTA for even thinking there\u2019s a possibility that you aren\u2019t the asshole. Like do you think your sister was sobbing cause it was funny? Do you think everyone went dead silent cause it was funny? Do you think your parents are (rightfully) pissed off because it was soooo funny? Are you 18 or 8? You\u2019re the asshole and if you really needed to come here and ask if you were in the wrong or not then you still have *a lot* of growing up to do.\n\nEdit // fixed a typo", "Am I the asshole for assaulting my sister with cake on her birthday? \n\nYes,  YTA", "YTA - for the reasons everyone else has said.\n\nBut also as a parent I'd be devastated if a cake I'd bought or made was ruined like that and wasted.\n\nSo many pranks on social media are staged and it would be a good idea to remember that next time.", "YTA. Humiliating someone on their birthday and ruining their cake because you saw a few Youtube videos about it? Sheesh.", "YTA. You're FAR too old to think that things that other people do on youtube are always good things to do in real life.\n\nAnd you know it'd upset or at least irritate your sister otherwise it wouldn't have been worth doing.\n\nSo you made her the butt of a joke, ruined her composure (and hair/makeup which she may have spent a lot of time getting ready beforehand), and humiliated her in front of her friends.\n\nNot to mention you did it two on one, because you're bullies.\n\nThe fact that she cried should have been your big clue - you shouldn't be asking if you are the asshole, you should already know that making someone cry on their birthday is something you apologise for IMMEDIATELY even if you really didn't know it was mean, and then carry on making up for afterwards until she feels better.\n\nBut no, you're still questioning if you were even in the wrong. And yes, you're very much in the wrong.", "YTA. I\u2019m not sure how you thought outright humiliating your sister on her birthday would be a funny joke. I feel like you should have enough emotional intelligence to understand why this wrong.", "YTA.  Not just because you embarrassed your sister, but *it can be dangerous to smash faces into cakes.*\n\nThere might be dowel rods / skewers holding up the cake or decorations, not to mention candles that were lit just a moment ago and might leave burns or hot wax.  There are many people that have lost eyes or have been seriously harmed by a \"prank\" such as this.\n\nAt 18 you're an adult.  Act like it.", "YTA.   I cannot say this strong enough.  You are 18, not 5.   Actually even a 5 YO would know better.   If I were a parent, you would be facing severe consequences", "YTA and you know you are. You are also old enough to know the crap on SM is often staged for effect. You owe her an apology and hope she forgives you. On what planet would it be ok to assault someone?", "YTA - You ruined your sisters birthday and their cake. It might be news to you but you don't have to copy anything off YouTube/Tiktok.", "YTA\n\nhow the hell did you watch your sister start sobbing after you bullied her and not immediately realize you fucked up? \n\nIt was your sister\u2019s birthday and you decided it would be funny to put your hands on her and ruin her birthday cake? That\u2019s humiliating. It\u2019s not funny. Did you even stop to consider your sister\u2019s feelings? If she liked pranks or did similar things. Or did you just decide to be cruel and emotionally stunted? \n\nApologize to your sister. I can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t already. You must be used to bullying her and not giving a shit about her.", "Yes.  Massive AH.   An act of bullying and intimidation.   Very cruel.\n\nNo doubt you thought it amusing, but would you feel the same way if you had been the victim..?\n\nYou are a bully, as well as an AH.", "YTA and you have a real cruel streak if you thought that would be funny.", "YTA, 18 years old and you thought a prank off YouTube was a good idea?? You are 18, holy cow that\u2019s scary.", "YTA\n\nOnly do that kind of prank if you're absolutely sure the birthday person will enjoy it. Otherwise it's just humiliating and mean.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s a dumb and cruel thing to do", "Yta, you humiliated your sister and ruined a cake. Pretty much zero people enjoy having their face shoved into cake, much less in front of all of their friends and family on what is probably the most important day of young people\u2019s lives.", "YTA. I shudder to think what you're gonna do after you find more videos on youtube, some of which may be more inappropriate than this, to put it mildly.", "Keeping it short: YTA.\n\nLonger version: just because you saw it on the internet, that doesn't make it a good idea. The fact that you & your other brother think it's funny to humiliate someone else says a lot about your stunted senses of humor.", "YTA. Grow up. Life isn\u2019t YouTube and I feel so bad for your sister getting her cake ruined and making a mess of her face, hair, and possibly her clothes. What was supposed to be her day, you royally fucked up. You owe her more than an apology.", "YTA, how is this funny? Did she deserve to be humiliated in front of everyone and have her makeup ruined for your sadistic amusement?\n\n\nI swear TikTok and YouTube and their \u2018prank culture\u2019 have a lot to answer for. Pranks aren\u2019t funny and you can grow a spine and say no to things.", "Of course YTA. I\u2019m shocked you thought otherwise.", "YTA. And now she deserves a sincere apology from both of you (acknowledging that you were both jerks) along with an even nicer cake. Buy her a nice gift as well.", "YTA I can\u2019t even with you. I\u2019m so angry at this thinking you thought it was funny. I hope you are punished and punished good", "YTA. What a jerk move. The videos you saw were likely staged. You ruined your sisters cake and birthday. And for what?", "Yup YTA so are all the people on YouTube. Stop idolizing assholes and maybe you'll stop acting like one.", "You really can't be so immature to think that shoving your sister's face in her cake then smearing it all over her face was a good idea.  \n\nYTA, and I can't believe you really thought this this was going to be funny.  You'll be lucky to have your sister forgive you.", "YTA.  What fucking planet do you live on that makes you think this is okay?", "YTA. I don\u2019t think anyone would think this is funny. You ruined a special moment for her.", "YTA. If you call it a prank but the other person is not laughing it's actually bullying", "YTA. \n\nLet's get this straight, you embarrassed your sister on her birthday. You also assaulted her. You ruined her cake, and you took the attention away from her. Pranks are for assholes, full stop. You deserve everything that is going to come your way. Grow up. Be better. Apologize. You would not be OK if someone did this to you, and you know it.", "YTA", "Of course YTA.", "YTA you need to buy her a new cake and apologize", "I mean, it\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s immature and obnoxious. YTA.", "YTA- why is it funny to ruin someone\u2019s birthday?", "YTA. Why do we have to still explain to people that using staged social media posts as inspiration for their actions is a bad idea?", "YTA. Why did you think this would be funny? Did either of you think about how your sister would feel?", "YTA\n\nINFO: Why, exactly,  did you think it would be funny?", "YTA! Your sister was sobbing and you have to ask if you messed up. You embarrassed her in front of everyone.", "YTA. Please aim higher in life and don\u2019t use YouTube for inspiration.", "YTA \n\nDouble YTA if you did not apologize. \n\nUnless you are a family who pranks each other with consent don't do things like this.\n\nIt is rare that a prank can be good natured and the prank can be funny.", "Cut and dry YTA. \n\nThe only time anything like this is MAYBE alright is if she\u2019d mentioned a video like that in the past and thought it\u2019d be fun to experience. \n\nBut honestly even then it\u2019s a risk, people change their minds when reality hits. \n\nAlso stop doing things you see on YouTube.\n\nEdit: spelling", "If you spend your life copying things you saw on social media, you are going to wake up one day with no friends, no relationship, and a family that doesn't want anything to do with you\n\nNobody likes pranks\n\nPeople laugh when they aren't the person being pranked...but nobody actually likes pranks...they just tolerate them some times\n\nGrow up\n\nYTA", "YTA and a pretty stupid one at that. You effectively ruined her celebration and embarrassed her in front of her friends to amuse yourself. It would be a good idea to stop copying things you see on the internet before you really mess things up.", "YTA. You went for a cheap laugh instead of trying to make your sister feel good on her birthday. \nThat shit is not funny. Apologise like there is no tomorrow and remember that she has every right not to want to forgive you.\nAlso at 18 you should know better.", "Pretty tired of people using the \"prank\" explanation as an excuse for behavior that is actually bullying. YTA, and if you don't realize those videos are staged and not real, you're a moron, too.", "YTA - Life lesson, if you see it on YT, often it's set up ahead of time and everything is in the gig.    Never fuck with anyone's cake.", "Info: She was sobbing afterwards and you still need to ask and post about it?", "This has to be fake, YTA", "So you didn't just embarrass your sister on her Birthday but also ruined a good cake so no one could enjoy it. Yes, YTA, you and your brother.", "YTA.", "Wasn't actually going to read this one but yeh YTA\n\nThe YT video were all happy and jokey because they knew it was coming. You are 18, not 7. Apologise to your sis and buy her a big ass cake.", "Nah you would have been wearing the remainder of the cake if that were me. \n\nYTA", "YTA. and honestly your sisters reaction should be enough for you to realize that. You took the celebration that was literally supposed to be all about her and made her the butt of a \"joke\"(Joke in this instance meaning ruining her birthday cake and rubbing sticky food all over her face- for some reason this was supposed to be funny).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologize to your sister.", "Yes. Definitely. Quit living your life based on social media videos.", "YTA that\u2019s just mean. You said your sister is kind. Why would you be such jerks to her?", "YTA.  No one wants to have cake smeared on their face.  It's not funny or fun for the person involved so it is simply a cruel prank.\n\nAlso, you can't believe YouTube or TikTok videos as people do things for views.   It's entirely possible what you watched were set-ups that the person being \"caked\" was in on for the views.", "YTA.\n\nFirst - that is just rude and snotty.\n\nSecond and most important many cakes have wood dowels stuck inside of them for support.  You could have stabbed your sister in the face with a wooden stake.  How funny would that have been?", "YTA. You know, I never understand why people think it\u2019s funny to ruin perfectly good cake in someone\u2019s face. I think it\u2019s time to talk with your sister and give a genuine apology.\n\n(Side note: Why does this remind me of the video of the older sister trying to push her little sister\u2019s face in the cake, only then to tussle with her and put her in a chokehold until a parent intervenes thus making the birthday girl cry?)", "Of course YTA. I can\u2019t believe that you would think she\u2019d laugh at that. I hate to tell you, but not everything you see on YouTube is real, or will get you the same reaction in real life.", "You're an asshole and your sister deserves a heartfelt apology. Asshole.", "YTA. No one wants cake smeared on their face.\n\nAnd I say this as a Mexican.  This is literally a thing we do in our culture and I hate it. I don't know a single person who likes it.", "YTA..you owe your sister a massive apology..and a new cake..and probably a very nice apology gift. You're 18 grow up. This is just mean and unfunny. You say your sister is laid back and kind why would you do this to her? You and your brother are cruel and any shame and anger your family feels for you is deserved.", "Yes YTA, you and your brothers. And every other person who does this on YouTube. Who thinks hey let\u2019s celebrate someone\u2019s birthday by humiliating them, ruining their birthday cake and upsetting them. What about that screams happy birthday to you?", "1000% percent YTA. YouTube/TikTok are usually staged and have consent (even if you don\u2019t see that, the \u201csurprise\u201d can be an act). You didn\u2019t have consent, probably caused a good amount of discomfort, wrecked whatever way she may have decided to present herself for the day, and humiliated her by making her a punchline for your joke.", "YTA. Those videos are staged, not a reflection of real life. No one actually enjoys having their face shoved unexpectedly into their birthday cake. You all owe your sister and parents a huge apology.", "YTA\n\nSo a YouTube video that\u2019s highly edited is what you were going to trust? \n\nWell done. You\u2019re a bully now.", "YTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t do that to someone without their consent and without knowing whether they\u2018d also find it funny.\n\nYou humiliated her and ruined her celebrationy. As her older brother, you should know and do better. You\u2018re cruel!", "Uncivilized and rude.", "Yta if you didn\u2019t apologize and care about her reaction. Yes.", "YTA - if it not something you do as a tradition, do not do it (In my family the kids tend to do that to each other, they enjoy it of course it is AFTER we all get cake haha).  I wish people would stop trying to imitate Youtube videos, especially to unsuspecting people.", "YTA.", "You're old enough to go to jail for \"pranks\" like this. Grow up.   YTA.", "Of course you\u2019re YTA!! In what scenario did you think you were not going to be labeled as a complete asshole in this story?!", "Are you dense? Yes YTA people in those videos also have a backup cake and generally the person knows its happening", "I didn\u2019t even need to read the post to know YTA", "YTA This isn't a new trend, and it has always been horrible. Imagine wasting food like that.", "YTA and I think you accidentally added a \u201c1\u201d in your age.", "YTA and you know it. How is this a serious question?", "YTA. Doing these social media pranks in real life is never a good idea.", "Bro, don\u2019t do those pranks on social media. Most of those are staged. It\u2019s not real life.", "YTA. Anyone who does shit like this because they saw it on the internet is not only an asshole, but a moron as well. It\u2019s not, nor has it ever been, funny. You failed, and your parents failed as well.", "DUDE obviously YTA. in no world is that funny at all. It's immature, selfish, and ruins a special day for someone. Grow up", "YTA - stop copying YouTube and TikTok videos", "YTA.   why do people still do this??", "YTA You and your brother ruined your sister's 18th birthday. It's not funny to humiliate someone who you supposedly love. I'm sure your sister took time doing her makeup and finding something special to wear for her birthday celebration with family and friends. There was probably a special birthday cake too. Now all she'll remember is what the two of you did.", "Yes, YTA, omg. You better give the most heartfelt apology to your sister.", "\"A lot more happened  after that.\"\n\nEducated  guess,you're  also the AH there.", "YTA and this can be dangerous. Sometimes bakers will put stakes in cakes to keep them solid and preserve them. I\u2019ve seen videos where people get severely injured from stupid pranks and the sticks impaling them in the eye.", "Let met make this short. They are never funny to the people who\u2019s face is smashed with cake. Fucking YTA", "YTA.  This shouldn't even be a question.  \n\nThis is not \"funny\" at all, it's a major dick move.  You ruined your sister's birthday cake, which is a huge waste of food on top of being incredibly mean.  You ruined her hairstyle and makeup that she likely spent a lot of time and effort doing, and possibly also damaged her clothes with food stains.  You made a big mess, which I suspect other people probably had to clean up, at least in part.  But worst of all, you embarrassed your sister horribly in front of all her family and friends, at a celebration to honour HER.  That is so fucked up.  You deserve to be smacked.\n\nYou're 18 years old OP, you're supposed to be an \"adult\" now.  Grow the fuck up and stop thinking the dumbass shit on social media is a good thing to do.", "YTA.", "YTA. The videos are staged and set up for views.  They are not real life and peoples reactions are not real.  You messed up!", "YTA.\n\nIt's actually pretty simple.  If the person being pranked won't be happy about the prank, you are a bully.\n\nThere is nothing (albeit short) story which would indicate she enjoys pranks like this.\n\nQuite frankly, most people wouldn't.", "You know YTA, and I would assume you're just posting here to brag about your \"hilarious\" prank, not because you are actually concerned about whether you did something wrong.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re immature and stupid. Do better and grow up", "YTA. Mean \"pranks\" like that are only ever funny to the people doing them. You were immature and cruel, and need to apologize to your sister.", "YES YTA. This \"prank\" is never going to be funny. Go apologize to your sister, you ruined her day.", "YTA\n\nMaybe it would be funny to a 10 year old. \n\nClearly not old enough to have any responsibility. If you drive I hope your parents take your car off you.", "You\u2019re the AH for not only what you did, but for thinking you needed to identify yourself as (18m) twice in the first two sentences. We got it, you\u2019re a young idiot. It\u2019s been noted.", "So you humiliated her as a \u201cjoke\u201d on her birthday in front of everyone and wonder if YTA?  Seriously?  YES, of course you are.", "YTA BIG TIME. And apparently not old enough to use the internet because you saw bullying behavior and thought it was a good idea. \n\n\nI would feel inclined to beat the shit out of anyone that did that to my kid.", "Oooooo yeah YTA she probably had her hair and makeup done nicely to take pictures with her friends and you just ruined her day", "YTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t funny to anyone. Grow up.", "Sorry dude\u2026 totally the AH. TikTok doesn\u2019t predict how your sister would react to such a thing\u2026 did you stop to consider her personality? Is she normally easy going? Or high strung and nervous?  Does she dish out pranks like that? \nAnd take them herself in stride? \n\nMaybe\u2026 only maybe\u2026 if she had the right personality and IF her friends weren\u2019t there and it was just family\u2026 she maybe, mighta sorta been ok\u2026\n\nBut clearly you either don\u2019t know your sister very well, or you overestimated how a stupid trend might come down. \n\nYou owe her and your parents a huge apology and a cake. Especially you\u2026 as the older bro.\n\n\nDo better.", "This is never funny. Yta", "YTA", "YTA. Grow up.", "Yes. Major YTA.", "Definitely YTA", "You really have to ask? . smh", "YTA can't believe you even have to ask.", ">Now this was all inspired by a couple of YouTube videos my brother saw a couple of days ago and things went well in those videos and people were laughing in them\n\nhonestly? It's not the best idea to do things like this & assume what someone's reaction is going to be because on YouTube, TikTok or literally anywhere in social media someone was laughing about it.\n\nYTA. You two fucked up.\nWhen your sister will be ready apologize to her & please never again do things like some strangers do on their videos.", "YTA pranks are never funny", "YTA you don't have to copy every stupid video you see online. You embarrassed your sister ruined her birthday and the cake hope it was worth it", "YTA, and so is your brother. A joke/prank isn't funny if it leaves the person being pranked in tears. Also, you guys ruined a perfectly good cake so that nobody was able to enjoy it. If I was a guest at that party, I'd have been annoyed at y'all for that because I love cake. You two need to apologize to your sister and either pay your parents back for the cost of the cake or buy a new one. I hope you both learn from this on how better to treat your sister.", "Most pranks on youtube are staged, do not use them as an example. Apologize to your sister and offer to get her a new cake. YTA", "Yes yta and you need to explain and apologise.", "YTA. A prank is funny when everyone is laughing. Clearly you and your brother were the only one who found it funny, so it's not a prank, it's just mean.\n\n\nHow would you feel if it was your birthday, and your dad decided to pull down your pants in front of your friends and family? You probably wouldn't think that was funny, but iT's JuSt A PrAnK bRo.", "YTA", "YTA that was cruel. Your poor sister.", "YTA. Pranks like that are very, very rarely ever actually funny, and after 17 years you should know how your sister would react to something like that. I think you knew she\u2019d be upset but thought everyone else would think it was hilarious, and didn\u2019t care how she would feel if you got to take all the attention. I can get the 14 year old thinking this was funny, but you\u2019re too old for this shit. You need to grow up and apologize to your sister.", "Please ground yourself from any form of online videos until you\u2019re old enough to think for yourself/with any time amount of common sense.  YTA", "Obviously YTA. Jeez. Your poor sister. You owe her big time. Such an asshole move.", "YTA - still waiting for you to explain how this was funny \ud83e\uddd0", "YTA, You ruined your sister's birthday.\nBesides my abhorrence of wasting food, don't everyone know that most youtube videos are played?", "YTA, do you not own a brain? You are 18y old, it's finally time to start using it.", "YTA, and it\u2019s so blatantly obvious I can\u2019t even believe you wasted your time or ours typing this question to ask. \n\nAnytime the person involved is in tears you know you messed up bad. The only reason you should have typed up this question was not to find out if YTA, but to ask for suggestions on all the different ways you can begin to try and make things up to your sister! Fix it.", "YTA\n\nEveryone who does this is horrible.  You are 18 years old perhaps its time you grew up and stopped acting like you are five.", "YTA I'm not surprised about a 14 year old wanting to do this, but an 18 year old? Man that's just messed up. You should know better.", "YTA. You humiliated and physically bullied your sister, on her birthday, in front of presumably all her friends, and ruined a cake so there was nothing to eat. Yes. You're the asshole. So are a lot of the people in those videos, most of which are either staged or the \"victim\" was asked beforehand if they would be ok with it.", "YTA. You need to apologize first off..\nAnd no, shoving a cake in someone\u2019s face isn\u2019t as funny as a scripted YouTube video makes it out to be.\nOf course your parents and sister are mad.", "Yta I will never understand why people think this is funny but it absolutely is not. It can ruin an entire event. You owe your sister and everyone else an apology.", "YTA, without a doubt. You\u2019re young, but that\u2019s not an excuse to have such poor judgement. Please don\u2019t be the kind of person who is \u201cinspired\u201d by dumb social media trends. Apologize to your sister and your parents and grow up.", "Uhm, that was a mean prank, and really immature. You ruined a moment for her. YTA and so is your brother.", "I hate to break it to you but dude, you're 18 and should have known better than your 14 year old brother. The people in the videos usually do this as a family tradition but it wasn't in your case. YTA but you can fix things if you just own what you did and apologise.", "YTA. 100%. Just because you find something funny, doesn\u2019t mean someone else will and ultimately you embarrassed your sister in front of everyone. Apologize to her immediately and quit listening to ideas from your 14 year old brother.", "YTA you even have to ask?", "Hope you bought her another cake. YTA so much.", "YTA. Jokes are supposed to be funny - this was just straight up rude and nasty. I can't believe you need to come on reddit and ask this?!

My(m18) brother(m14) and I had an idea to make things funny, which was that right after my sister blew out the candles on her cake, we would push my sister\u2019s face softly into the cake, but then smear a lot of the cake onto her face.\n\nNow this was all inspired by a couple of YouTube videos my brother saw a couple of days ago and things went well in those videos and people were laughing in them, so we thought this would be a good idea. Well when we actually did it, and finished smearing the cake with our bare hands onto her face, my sister just stood up and was straight up sobbing while cake bits dripped from her face, and everyone in the room was quiet.\n\nA lot more happened after that and our parents are to say the least, really fucking mad at us, and our sister doesn\u2019t even talk to us, but I\u2019ll keep things short.

That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay to just randomly do that to an unsuspecting family member.  Stop getting your prank ideas off YouTube and Tik Tok, most of those are faked, anyway.

The person whose cake was just ruined by having their face pushed into it...on their birthday.", "You're 18, and you need to learn three major skills very quickly, because you're too damn close to adulthood to still think this is a good idea.\n\nOne: start assessing what you see on the internet critically instead of swallowing it whole.- a lot of YouTube/TikTok pranks are staged, because they're either unsafe or too close to bullying to do in reality.\n\nTwo: know your audience. Real life isn't like a cartoon and a prank should be aimed at the target finding it funny, not you or anyone else (if it's just you finding someone else's misfortune funny, then it's bullying). Which for most people rules out humiliation, disruption of important life events, destruction of property/clothing, anything that makes them have to go take a shower...\n\nThree: learn to think ahead and consider the consequences of your actions - you saw a funny video where everything went well, but that doesn't always happen in real life. Real people panic, sometimes they breathe wrong and inhale frosting, sometimes someone screws up badly and forgets to move a candle and they get burnt, sometimes if it's a big cake, there's a support structure of rigid stakes inside the cake  - there have been a few truly horrific accidents involving lost eyes and facial scarring resulting from someone's face getting slammed into a cake. \n\nFurther to that last point, even assuming that no injury happened, what did you think would happen next? Did you think your parents would thank you for getting food all over the carpet? Or for wasting the cake that they spent good money on? Heck, did a member of you family make that cake - did you waste their time and their energy, and the love they put into it? Were you expecting the party goers to eat food that someone's face had been in? Or were you expecting there to be a magically appearing new cake? And what did you expect your sister to do - sit through the rest of the party in dirty clothes and sticky hair?! Or miss her own party and her own guests because she needed a shower and a complete change of clothing?! \n\nYou didn't think about it, did you? You didn't consider your sister's sense of humour or her celebration or even think the practical issue that most women have long hair that takes time to dry and time to manage, and so she'd have to leave her own damn party for a long time. You just wanted the applause and the praise for being funny, and you used your sister as a prop for your comedy. That was selfish. And thoughtless.
