We're all with her and she's learning to stay strong.\n\nA couple of weeks ago my wife mentioned, casually, that maybe I should ask my daughter to return the portion of the reception costs we contributed, since it's \"no longer happening\". I was shocked. I told my wife my daughter is in very deep pain right now and I'm never going to ask her for something like this, and my wife dropped the subject.\n\nMore recently she brought it up again, saying \"she's sure my daughter would also agree with us\" and \"the money is ours, and she doesn't have to give it back right now\". Again I told her no, I wouldn't be doing anything like that.\n\nYesterday I found out she'd called my daughter herself to talk about this. I got pretty mad, got all the cash I had around, threw it on my wife's desk and asked if she was happy now.\n\nShe was upset and said I was demeaning her when she was just trying to look out for us.\n\nI don't think I'm the asshole here but my wife is pretty upset with what I did, so open to opinions.", "created_utc": 1670383483, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zeqqe7/aita_for_throwing_money_at_my_wifes_desk_after/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's absolutely absurd that she wants to get that money back. If it were sometime like a breakup or some other kind of failure, especially on her part (ie she was cheating and husband found out), I might understand going back for the money.

I think a good way to help your daughter would be to let her have the money if any of it is refunded. \n\nAs for your wife, tell her to sit down and shut up. She should be ashamed of herself.

What is wrong with your wife? She is asking back for a supposed gift from a grieving woman that just lost her husband? She does realize that just cause the reception is no longer happening, the venue, catering et.c. are not going to give all the money back, so the widow would have to eat the cost on top of everything else.

Call her and be sure she knows you didn\u2019t have anything to do with your wife\u2019s call. \nYour wife is a massive AH.

I read this as if your daughter is not your wife\u2019s daughter (she called \u201cmy\u201d daughter\u2026) so she had NO right to call her and ask for these funds. Such insensitivity is abhorrent. If anything, she could have called the venue and had the funds refunded on behalf of all the investors and saved your daughter from having to do anything.

I do admit I might've gone overboard with the money throwing, hence this post. But at the time I wasn't thinking of anyone except my daughter who's been widowed at 23", "No, his mistake was not throwing the stepmom out of the house.", "No way. \n\nI can't imagine being so heartlessly cruel to a young widow. That woman cares more about money than she does about the suffering of another human being. \n\nAll he did was throw money at her. That's better than the major dressing down that she deserves. \n\nAnd he did it in private, and not in front of God and everyone. \n\nHe is a kinder man that I think I could be.", "Love how you made this about gender when that specifically isn\u2019t the issue here.", "Harassing a grieving widow for money is way worse than merely \u201ctone deaf,\u201d it\u2019s utterly repulsive.", "How is it logical? Most of the services contracted will have cancellation policies. OP\u2019s daughter may only recoup a small fraction of what was paid. If you want to be that way about it, OP and his wife are only owed 1/3 of the received refunds. His post states the wife asked for \u201cthe portion of the reception costs we contributed\u201d. That sounds like ALL to me, not 1/3 of potential refunds. OP\u2019s wife is asking to be made whole when no one else will be. That\u2019s not logical. That\u2019s selfish.", "OP, I hope you edit your post to \u201cex wife\u201d. Don\u2019t stay with this evil, selfish woman. She will make your daughter\u2019s life miserable, & you can do better than to be married to this piece of sh&t b$tch.", "Brownie points.  She's gotta show her good side.\n\nI read recently that when you begin a relationship it takes two months for people's masks to slip, and here comes the red flags.  I reckon it's situational as well.  It took the wife two months to show how little she cared about the daughter, and where her true priorities lie.  She's thinking about that money.", "Has she always been this cruel to your daughter?", "Bizarre. Not at all what I expected by the sound of her behavior. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your son-in-law. Maybe there is something else going on with your wife .", "100% NTA!!  \n\nNot only did your wife disregard your daughter's feelings, she also disregarded your direct wishes. She went behind your back and very crassly added greater distress to your daughter who is grieving.\n\nWas throwing money at her demeaning? Probably, however, her actions were equally demeaning of your wishes and personal stance on the issue, and demeaning of your daughter and her grief.", "You know, sometimes we need to do things over the top to get people's attention. In this case, throwing the money at her got her attention\n\nI don't think you owe her an apology. SHE owes you and your daughter an apology for being so cold, unfeeling, and cruel", "It doesnt specify whether she was asking for the full amount, or her 3rd tho", "They've usually gotten along pretty well. They're not extremely close and my daughter spent most of the time at my ex wife's (her mom), but that's understanble.\n\nMy wife has always preferred \"her daughter\" over \"my daughters\", but I didn't see anything bad happening between any of them.", "How else should a reader interpret \u201cthe portion of the reception costs we contributed\u201d?  If the OP intended it to be 1/3 of the refund, pretty sure he would have said that.", "I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019d have been this callous and cruel if this were happening to her own daughter. I would never be able to look at her the same way if I was in your daughter\u2019s shoes. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this on top of a terrible loss.", "I think you should really evaluate what kind of person you married and how she treats your daughter. She sounds absolute evil, and this is coming from someone who has had some really bad step parents. She does not care about your daughter(s) and she has made that perfectly clear to you. NTA.", "NTA but there's a problem with your post. You say you are all there for your daughter and all of grieving with her but your wife is not. That woman don't give a fuck. Thank you for at least trying to protect your daughter from that", "I'd be wondering if there were other things going on behind the scenes that your dsughters never told you about.", "Typical evil stepmoms always know to wait to show their true colors only when the other person is at their lowest point in life. I hope you make this woman your ex wife.", "Keep the daughter, surrender the deposits, eject the wife.  Soon.  After she went after your daughter (and around you) when your daughter was grieving speaks volumes.  She disregarded you, she attacked your daughter.  When someone shows you who they are, believe then.  You are TA if you stay with this woman.  Your daughter is never coming over there, which will be sad in case and any future significant other or offspring.  They won\u2019t meet you.  Your choice.  Love or Greed, pick one.", "Your wife is dismissive as fck tho", "Well, now you have.", "My first thought as well.", "Almost certainly.  This would  be too huge an escalation to arrive at if she hadn't been inconsiderate and hateful to Op's daughter  before."]}
