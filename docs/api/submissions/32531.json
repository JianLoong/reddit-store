She's been through many miscarriages in the past, too.\n\nAfter my wife Madison (34 F) gave birth to our son Ethan, we allowed Laura to interact with him. We dropped him at her house if we wanted someone to baby-sit, etc. Whenever they came here, she played with him and all that.\n\nYesterday, we dropped him at her place again and when we arrived, she was playing with him. We just remained there for a while and talked while she played with him. I heard her saying \"Where's your mother? Your mother's right here,\" referring to herself.\n\nI did not like that & Madison did not either. But it got worse. She said \"And your Father's here to play with you as well,\" referring to her husband Bob (37 M). I was about to say something as I was shocked, but then I realized that Ethan now called them \"Momma\" and \"Dadda\" for the first time. The first time he ever said his parents' name, and it was theirs. He'd never called us that before.\n\nMadison began to cry a lot while I got furious. I called Laura a \"fucking bitch\" and asked her what she's thinking to call them that. He husband got mad and they began to argue, saying that he's as good as their son, etc. Madison accused her of being a \"goddamn back-stabber\", and in the end we took Ethan away from them by asking them to not treat my son as if it's theirs. Laura was crying, and her husband was shouting at us while we left.\n\nI was wondering whether I overreacted. I know that they don't have children, so did I do anything wrong?\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1701959499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cwu1w/aita_for_asking_my_sisterinlaw_to_stop_treating/", "score": 1178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She did become pregnant, and we were all very happy, she ended up having a miscarriage, she tried again and nothing.  I cried for her, because I had 4 children at this time, and it was just so heartbreaking.  I ended up finding out I was pregnant shortly after her miscarriage.  Her and my other SIL told me that I need to give her my child because I have enough.  It caused a huge rift in the family, and we ended up going no contact until MIL passed and they called us, I had a sixth child by that time they had never met.  Just be careful OP, those who lost get very big ideas and it can cause enormous issues.  I hope your SIL gets much needed grief counseling and also gets to be a mother someday.

She's been through many miscarriages in the past, too. \n\nAfter my wife Madison (34 F) gave birth to our son Ethan, we allowed Laura to interact with him. We dropped him at her house if we wanted someone to baby-sit, etc. Whenever they came here, she played with him and all that. \n\nYesterday, we dropped him at her place again and when we arrived, she was playing with him. We just remained there for a while and talked while she played with him. I heard her saying \"Where's your mother? Your mother's right here,\" referring to herself.\n\nI did not like that & Madison did not either. But it got worse. She said \"And your Father's here to play with you as well,\" referring to my brother-in-law. I was about to say something as I was shocked, but then I realized that Ethan now called them \"Momma\" and \"Dadda\" for the first time. The first time he ever said his parents' name, and it was theirs. He'd never called us that before.\n\nMadison began to cry a lot while I got furious. I called Laura a \"fucking bitch\" and asked her what she's thinking to call them that. He husband got mad and they began to argue, saying that he's as good as their son, etc. Madison accused her of being a \"goddamn back-stabber\", and in the end we took Ethan away from them by asking them to not treat my son as if it's theirs. Laura was crying, and her husband was shouting at us while we left.\n\nI was wondering whether I overreacted. I know that they don't have children, so did I do anything wrong?\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also how on earth does it work that he \u201crealised Ethan that now called them momma and daddy for the first time\u201d. Like I would expect it to say \u201cEthan called them momma and dadda\u201d if that was what happened, you don\u2019t just realise that out of nowhere. It happened or it didn\u2019t.", "And why do people reply to them as if they're real?? This one is so obviously phony", ">but you are for going off.\n\nNope, perfectly justified actually.", "Laura's behaviour is psychotic. For you to describe it as bizarre, is bizarre. The downvotes are coming because two crazy people are being crazy in front of a baby, and it's not the parents fault.", "No idea why the downvotes. All good points", "Wow... this is an astonishingly bad take.", "> But how much time is your child (not an \u201cit, btw) spending there? Were you using the SIL as free childcare?\n\nvery curious about this", "The child won't understand at such a young age, he'll forget quite quickly. It's the parents they are hurting", "> you have TWO people living the delusion. This is a recipe for disaster\n\nThey actually started fighting with OP and his wife about it!! This is crazy!\n\nThey crossed WAAAAAY over the line. OP and his wife should minimize interaction with this couple. And they should *never* leave their child alone with them again.\n\nNTA", ">Do you think they would try to kidnap your child?\n\nI would be more worried about them trying to use CPS or legal system to take the child. This level of delusion grows. They will start finding fault with actual parents. I knew someone in our town who injured the child repeatedly and reported it to CPS as actual parents causing the injuries. They sought guardianship and were awarded. \n\nThis level of delusion is dangerous. Go No Contact with them immediately.", "This actually happened where I live. Woman kidnapped baby from church nursery. She ended up going to jail but she seriously thought she was the child\u2019s mother.  Shocked everyone!", "This. Don't allow access. Psychosis is real", "I just commented the same thought.   Ethan should not be near them.", "The vast majority of child abductions are committed by someone known to the family.\n\nI'm not saying it's definitely on the cards here but those are some major red flags", "[removed]", "Very well put.", "I know that Laura had therapy, but I don't think it's worked. Her husband hasn't had one, and as for adoption, they're saying that they want a child who's related to them. They also consider surrogacy immoral.", "Right? I\u2019m glad someone else caught this. They must be around Ethan A LOT for him to be calling them mom and dad, and not, you know, his actual parents. It sounds like OP and her husband drop Ethan off whenever they feel like it.\n\nIt\u2019s still not an ok thing for the in-laws to be doing! NTA OP, but maybe you need to spend some more time with your kid.", "I think they should find help on their own. Even if they did seem to shape up and act reasonably, how  can op trust them again to not do the same crazy shit behind closed doors next time?", "Husband could be suffering, too, which only adds to their delusions that they're \"normal\" here", "Thank you, I'll do that. Laura's had therapy, but she discontinued it as she said that it wasn't working or something.", "I had a professor in college who called his child \"it\".

Either he has zero emotional connection to his own child (in which case there might be something to the story of the SIL taking over the parental role) or it's fake.", "I dunno, I think it's bizarre to behave psychoticly with a baby, and starting an obscenity screaming match is perhaps not the healthiest response. I would take the baby home, urge Laura to seek counseling and stop relying on her as a babysitter.", "True but that should be the last time they ever have a chance to do this to their child!", "Did I miss the baby's age?", "Children remember and absorb more than you think.", "they mean if it goes on, obviously.", "Go NC and contact an attorney to document everything in the event they try to take action against you.", "It sure is but I don\u2019t get how she and her husband both seem to have gone off the deep end here. If I was the husband and my wife did that I\u2019d be incredibly embarrassed and apologetic, also furious at her for damaging our relationship with the parents.", "NTA but you need to go NC and install cameras at your house. This behavior is not normal at all. The fact that the husband is also acting creepy is even more worrisome. Please take this seriously.", "Not a leap happened in my town. Kidnapped baby from church nursery!", "But they consider trying to convince your child that they are your child's parents moral?\n\nThis situation is so messed up I'm legit at a loss for words.\n\nI would at minimum go no contact for however long it takes for your child to correctly call you both momma and dada.\n\nNTA but your SIL and BIL need help.", "Adoption and surrogacy has a pretty strict evaluation process and seeing how completely beyond reason these 2 are those avenues are closed to them not by choice.", "Keep your child away from them. No visits of any kind, no second chances, cut them off completely. You can feel sympathy for them, but do not trust them. They won't stop trying to alienate you from your son. This is dangerous, protect your family", "With a surrogate the baby will have both SIL and BIL's DNA if she's able to use her eggs and his sperm. If her ovaries aren't functioning properly, she can also look into embryo adoption, but the baby won't have SIL's genetics, but she'll still experience pregnancy and birth, if she is able to keep the pregnancy. Or she can find a family member willing to be a surrogate for them, if she is dead set on wanting to adopt a family member's child. It's not right to just pick anyone's child and take it upon themselves to be the child's \"parents.\"", "But stealing your child is ok? Please for your safety and your child\u2019s go no contact and even file a police report.

And why was your first reaction to call her a \u201cfucking bitch\u201d rather than have a calm and rational discussion since this is presumably the first time you\u2019ve ever heard it? You\u2019re not TA for being upset, but your reaction makes me think you\u2019re either completely emotionally vacant or a child writing a fake post.", "You might want to alert his school/daycare if he goes to one just so they are aware of the situation too.", "Good for you for being perfect. Normal people don\u2019t always have the best reactions, specially in the heat of the moment. SIL is being beyond inappropriate and I can understand why OP and his wife were upset. NTA and I hope they keep their baby away from SIL.", "Agreed", "No, wasn't specified, but he'll likely be under two if they are coaxing him to talk and at this stage he won't make a connection between sounds and meaning, however he may be a bit confused if his mum asks him to call him mother too, he may think all women are mum and all men are dad lol", "Because psychosis causes you to behave in psychotic ways.", "He's probably doing it for his wife.", "Two days or so in a week, but sometimes more.

Rare but it happens.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think this is real. Child language acquisition doesn\u2019t work like a child using \u201cmamma\u201d and \u201cdadda\u201d to refer to two distinct people but only in their presence and never in front of anyone else, especially when those two people see the child twice a week. Great try though, I hope this was a fun exercise.", "Or maybe the husband is desperate to help his wife in her grief and depression, to the point he enables and excuses unforgivable behavior. The whole, let her do it if it makes her feel better.", "Defiantely could be. Thanks for the alternative explanation."]}
