She's been through many miscarriages in the past, too.\n\nAfter my wife Madison (34 F) gave birth to our son Ethan, we allowed Laura to interact with him. We dropped him at her house if we wanted someone to baby-sit, etc. Whenever they came here, she played with him and all that.\n\nYesterday, we dropped him at her place again and when we arrived, she was playing with him. We just remained there for a while and talked while she played with him. I heard her saying \"Where's your mother? Your mother's right here,\" referring to herself.\n\nI did not like that & Madison did not either. But it got worse. She said \"And your Father's here to play with you as well,\" referring to her husband Bob (37 M). I was about to say something as I was shocked, but then I realized that Ethan now called them \"Momma\" and \"Dadda\" for the first time. The first time he ever said his parents' name, and it was theirs. He'd never called us that before.\n\nMadison began to cry a lot while I got furious. I called Laura a \"fucking bitch\" and asked her what she's thinking to call them that. He husband got mad and they began to argue, saying that he's as good as their son, etc. Madison accused her of being a \"goddamn back-stabber\", and in the end we took Ethan away from them by asking them to not treat my son as if it's theirs. Laura was crying, and her husband was shouting at us while we left.\n\nI was wondering whether I overreacted. I know that they don't have children, so did I do anything wrong?\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1701959499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cwu1w/aita_for_asking_my_sisterinlaw_to_stop_treating/", "score": 2359, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She did become pregnant, and we were all very happy, she ended up having a miscarriage, she tried again and nothing.  I cried for her, because I had 4 children at this time, and it was just so heartbreaking.  I ended up finding out I was pregnant shortly after her miscarriage.  Her and my other SIL told me that I need to give her my child because I have enough.  It caused a huge rift in the family, and we ended up going no contact until MIL passed and they called us, I had a sixth child by that time they had never met.  Just be careful OP, those who lost get very big ideas and it can cause enormous issues.  I hope your SIL gets much needed grief counseling and also gets to be a mother someday.

It doesn't seem like a healthy situation for anyone involved. Your SIL and her husband are clearly still emotionally struggling with their own lack of children, and your child being with them so much has created new potentials for inappropriate coping on their part.

I would never allow her to see my child again, neither alone nor with you or anyone there. Your sister is causing your child psychological and emotional harm. Removing her and your BIL from your son's life could be traumatic, so you might want to consult a child psychologist about the best way to do this. Unless the psychologist adamantly recommends otherwise, I'd go full on no contact. You and your wife are also being traumatized. I'd also be concerned that your sister and BIL would try to get legal custody of your son. It might sound overdramatic, but would they even go so far as to kidnap him?

She's been through many miscarriages in the past, too. \n\nAfter my wife Madison (34 F) gave birth to our son Ethan, we allowed Laura to interact with him. We dropped him at her house if we wanted someone to baby-sit, etc. Whenever they came here, she played with him and all that. \n\nYesterday, we dropped him at her place again and when we arrived, she was playing with him. We just remained there for a while and talked while she played with him. I heard her saying \"Where's your mother? Your mother's right here,\" referring to herself.\n\nI did not like that & Madison did not either. But it got worse. She said \"And your Father's here to play with you as well,\" referring to my brother-in-law. I was about to say something as I was shocked, but then I realized that Ethan now called them \"Momma\" and \"Dadda\" for the first time. The first time he ever said his parents' name, and it was theirs. He'd never called us that before.\n\nMadison began to cry a lot while I got furious. I called Laura a \"fucking bitch\" and asked her what she's thinking to call them that. He husband got mad and they began to argue, saying that he's as good as their son, etc. Madison accused her of being a \"goddamn back-stabber\", and in the end we took Ethan away from them by asking them to not treat my son as if it's theirs. Laura was crying, and her husband was shouting at us while we left.\n\nI was wondering whether I overreacted. I know that they don't have children, so did I do anything wrong?\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think you need a very strict boundary with them about not allowing your child anywhere near them till they get help.

As a minimum, \n- have the above conversation \n- get cameras inside and outside the house but don't tell your family you have them. \n- Speak to a detective/police officer and a psychiatrist about warning signs to look out for and what to do with your family member.\n- set strict boundaries and maintain them with your family especially Laura and her husband, potentially going NC but I do not recommend leaving your child with them. You may get backlash on this from extended family mainly because our closest family may be the most blind to what others can do. Just because they cannot or choose not to see how bad this is, does not mean you are doing wrong by maintaining the boundaries. You are protecting your child from potential danger.\n\nPs, some may say its harmless what they are doing. It is not.

I think I worry more because I had an abusive narcissist father who was dangerous, delusional and could not be reasoned with. I went NC with him cold turkey when I was 24 after he crossed a line that couldn\u2019t be uncrossed. If I had said anything, he would have festered on that and become even more furious. The risk level was just too high, and I worry it\u2019s the same here, only there\u2019s an innocent young child in the crosshairs. The fact that both of the in-laws are this delusional is what really worries me. It\u2019s beyond the levels of grieving due to infertility. If it was only one of them that was living in extreme delusions, you could at least hope the other could help talk them down off the ledge. But with them both acting this way, and both of them being furious already that THEY were treated like the one in the wrong, and that OP\u2019s reaction to their behavior was the problem, that is terrifying and only leads to them encouraging each other in an even more extreme escalation of delusions and behaviors. Paper trails are important, I agree, but they could also create a paper trail through a lawyer. \n\nUnfortunately contacting CPS ahead of time could also be viewed as suspicious on OP\u2019s part, and could result in an inquiry/investigation just for that alone (unfortunately CPS in many jurisdictions can have a lot of corruption within the system, and countless children are removed from the home unjustly. All it takes is the wrong social worker taking that call and spinning their own narrative). CPS is an absolute necessity for society, but it\u2019s only as good as the individuals who run it/work within it. Some jurisdictions are great, some are not. Same goes for the social workers. Basically, never involve CPS unless there is no other option, because it could make things even worse and end up as a living nightmare. \n\nGoing to a lawyer first instead for a paper trail and advice would might be better first move to see what a lawyer suggests their next moves should be to establish documentation and protection before resorting to contacting CPS or even before messaging the parents. They need to know how to legally protect themselves in this situation going forward, and a lawyer would be the one who would provide them the most accurate answers.\n\nPerhaps I worry too much, IDK, I just really fear for OP and their son. Two people living in emotional delusions and feeding off each other never ends well and has resulted in horrific crimes, even in people who you never would have guessed would become that kind of person. At the end of the day, I think we all just want OP, OP\u2019s wife and their son to be okay. I\u2019m just a bit predisposed to not rocking the boat anymore than is necessary, because I\u2019ve seen the ugly side of pushing a delusional person over the edge by simply just trying to reason with them or explain things in a direct, logical and rational manner. \n\nHopefully OP and his wife will be able to navigate this situation safely and in a healthy manner for all involved.
