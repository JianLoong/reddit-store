I have five boys, elder two (18 and 17) from a previous relationship, and the younger three with my late wife (15, 13, and 11). My 17 and 18-year-old both have jobs and contribute to buying their own food and clothes. My 15-year-old, we'll call him Jack, doesn't. I don't have a problem with this but it is relevant to the situation.\n\nWe're not badly off but I'm far from wealthy, and with five kids in the house I have to budget carefully. I can only buy but so much food and so many clothes, and the rule is unless you have your own money you have to accept what's there and that's it or there won't be enough to go around. (For those who'll say \u201cwell then should've had less kids\u201d, it's a bit late for that don't you think.) \n\nJack has been unable to keep a job, but that doesn't keep him from complaining about his clothes being too small/uncool and that he wishes he could eat like his friends (going out, nice restaurants, etc.). I understand, I grew up less fortunate than my friends as well and I hated it. But that doesn't mean I can magically change things.\n\nYesterday I came in from work and my younger sons tell me they were going to make PBJs but they can't find the peanut butter. I can't find it either so I end up asking my older sons and Jack. Turns out Jack not only ate the peanut butter but he's also been stealing food from his older brothers, too. I told Jack he was way old enough to know stealing is wrong and that he can't eat food that his little brothers need. He got annoyed and asked if I wanted him to start eating from garbage cans.\n\nNow I provide as best I can for all my children and while it could of course be better we're nowhere near the poverty level of the whole \u201ceating out the garbage\u201d trope. I told him the reality is that if he wants to buy fancy foods and snacks he's going to have to get a job and pay for them himself. He wasn't happy to hear this, but I think it needed to be said.

Even though OP is feeding and clothing 4 other people.  Also, he never said that Jack took the peanut butter because there was no food in the house.  I'm willing to bet that there is plenty of food in the house (i.e. the other kids were making sandwiches when they found out Jack had eaten all of the peanut butter).  OP is providing for his kids.  He just isn't buying name brand clothing or eating 5 star meals.  AND THAT'S ALRIGHT!\n\nLastly, OP never said that the kids HAVE to get jobs.  He just said that if you want more than what I am providing, you will need to pay for it yourself.  As long as OP IS providing for his kids, how does that not make sense?!?!\n\nOP - NTA.  I know it's rough out there and you are providing for your kids.  Maybe look into some benefit programs and see if there is anything out there for you that can only ADD to what you provide.

I have five boys, elder two (18 and 17) from a previous relationship, and the younger three with my late wife (15, 13, and 11). My 17 and 18-year-old both have jobs and contribute to buying their own food and clothes. My 15-year-old, we'll call him Jack, doesn't. I don't have a problem with this but it is relevant to the situation.\n\nWe're not badly off but I'm far from wealthy, and with five kids in the house I have to budget carefully. I can only buy but so much food and so many clothes, and the rule is unless you have your own money you have to accept what's there and that's it or there won't be enough to go around. (For those who'll say \u201cwell then should've had less kids\u201d, it's a bit late for that don't you think.) \n\nJack has been unable to keep a job, but that doesn't keep him from complaining about his clothes being too small/uncool and that he wishes he could eat like his friends (going out, nice restaurants, etc.). I understand, I grew up less fortunate than my friends as well and I hated it. But that doesn't mean I can magically change things.\n\nYesterday I came in from work and my younger sons tell me they were going to make PBJs but they can't find the peanut butter. I can't find it either so I end up asking my older sons and Jack. Turns out Jack not only ate the peanut butter but he's also been stealing food from his older brothers, too. I told Jack he was way old enough to know stealing is wrong and that he can't eat food that his little brothers need. He got annoyed and asked if I wanted him to start eating from garbage cans.\n\nNow I provide as best I can for all my children and while it could of course be better we're nowhere near the poverty level of the whole \u201ceating out the garbage\u201d trope. I told him the reality is that if he wants to buy fancy foods and snacks he's going to have to get a job and pay for them himself. He wasn't happy to hear this, but I think it needed to be said.

Sell any items you don't absolutely need. Downgrade your cell phone and computer and sell the nicer models. If you have a TV in your room or a video game console that is solely yours then sell them. Those are luxuries you don't need when you can't afford to take care of your kid's basic needs. Don't buy new clothes for yourself unless they're literally falling apart. Even then, get clothes from thrift stores or donation drives. Take public transport instead of driving to work if you drive. Cut down on the food you eat to one or two meals per day if you *genuinely* can't afford to feed your kids adequately. Your kids need the food more than you do since they're growing. If you're dating anyone then break it off. You need to focus your time, energy, and money on supporting your kids.\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, as a parent YOU need to make sacrifices to make sure your child's needs are met. Step up and be a better parent.\n\n\n\n\nETA just saw that your son is underweight. What you're doing is classified in most places as child neglect and/or abuse.
