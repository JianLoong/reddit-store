I have five boys, elder two (18 and 17) from a previous relationship, and the younger three with my late wife (15, 13, and 11). My 17 and 18-year-old both have jobs and contribute to buying their own food and clothes. My 15-year-old, we'll call him Jack, doesn't. I don't have a problem with this but it is relevant to the situation.\n\nWe're not badly off but I'm far from wealthy, and with five kids in the house I have to budget carefully. I can only buy but so much food and so many clothes, and the rule is unless you have your own money you have to accept what's there and that's it or there won't be enough to go around. (For those who'll say \u201cwell then should've had less kids\u201d, it's a bit late for that don't you think.) \n\nJack has been unable to keep a job, but that doesn't keep him from complaining about his clothes being too small/uncool and that he wishes he could eat like his friends (going out, nice restaurants, etc.). I understand, I grew up less fortunate than my friends as well and I hated it. But that doesn't mean I can magically change things.\n\nYesterday I came in from work and my younger sons tell me they were going to make PBJs but they can't find the peanut butter. I can't find it either so I end up asking my older sons and Jack. Turns out Jack not only ate the peanut butter but he's also been stealing food from his older brothers, too. I told Jack he was way old enough to know stealing is wrong and that he can't eat food that his little brothers need. He got annoyed and asked if I wanted him to start eating from garbage cans.\n\nNow I provide as best I can for all my children and while it could of course be better we're nowhere near the poverty level of the whole \u201ceating out the garbage\u201d trope. I told him the reality is that if he wants to buy fancy foods and snacks he's going to have to get a job and pay for them himself. He wasn't happy to hear this, but I think it needed to be said.

I have five boys, elder two (18 and 17) from a previous relationship, and the younger three with my late wife (15, 13, and 11). My 17 and 18-year-old both have jobs and contribute to buying their own food and clothes. My 15-year-old, we'll call him Jack, doesn't. I don't have a problem with this but it is relevant to the situation.\n\nWe're not badly off but I'm far from wealthy, and with five kids in the house I have to budget carefully. I can only buy but so much food and so many clothes, and the rule is unless you have your own money you have to accept what's there and that's it or there won't be enough to go around. (For those who'll say \u201cwell then should've had less kids\u201d, it's a bit late for that don't you think.) \n\nJack has been unable to keep a job, but that doesn't keep him from complaining about his clothes being too small/uncool and that he wishes he could eat like his friends (going out, nice restaurants, etc.). I understand, I grew up less fortunate than my friends as well and I hated it. But that doesn't mean I can magically change things.\n\nYesterday I came in from work and my younger sons tell me they were going to make PBJs but they can't find the peanut butter. I can't find it either so I end up asking my older sons and Jack. Turns out Jack not only ate the peanut butter but he's also been stealing food from his older brothers, too. I told Jack he was way old enough to know stealing is wrong and that he can't eat food that his little brothers need. He got annoyed and asked if I wanted him to start eating from garbage cans.\n\nNow I provide as best I can for all my children and while it could of course be better we're nowhere near the poverty level of the whole \u201ceating out the garbage\u201d trope. I told him the reality is that if he wants to buy fancy foods and snacks he's going to have to get a job and pay for them himself. He wasn't happy to hear this, but I think it needed to be said.

Do you realize that 40 ounce jars of peanut butter are almost always cheaper per ounce than 16 ounce jars?\n\nIf he's grown larger than his older brothers' clothes, then buy him new clothes.\n\nHe's not asking you for luxuries. He's asking you for the very basics of enough food to not be hungry and clothes that fit.\n\nAnd stop making your minor children buy their own clothes and food.", "Bro. \nHe's not allowed to eat like his older brothers bc they bought it w their own money and the rule is \"be happy with what's there\" but when he does just that, he's accused of stealing from his younger brothers.  Where DO you expect this child to find food?", "A pound of turkey? oh boy, 4 sandwiches just for me, how generous", "A pound of turkey cold cuts runs about 500 calories. An adolescent male, on average, needs about 2800 calories per day.", "You won't win this. Most people on this thread have never experienced true poverty. I will say that maybe saving up a little to get the boy a few outfits might be a good idea. If your right and he growing it is most likely beyond his control and he just needs to eat more currently. Try riding it out he should settle down after the spurt evens out. I had a foster mom give me a pair of her jeans to wear to school. I was about 5inches taller than her and a good deal slimmer.", "Nah you\u2019re right, tell him he can get lost if he doesn\u2019t like it, then your resources can go to the kids you clearly care about more", "Idk anything about food stamps, but there\u2019s thrifting and clothing donations from churches and such. You just have to google it in your area. There\u2019s pantries for food as well. Most commonly the issue when people need help and refuse it to their kids detriment, it\u2019s simply them putting their own ego ahead of needs", "I grew up in between a family in abject poverty and foster care, so I also have personal experience. \n\nStill not okay to neglect a child\u2019s physical needs. Or get mad at a child for \u201cstealing food\u201d. I understand \u201cbuy more food\u201d is not helpful, but it\u2019s also not helpful to get mad at a starving child.", "> need a place to stay and food to survive\n\nWhat do you think the logical step is when OP's son *cannot get the food he needs to survive*?", "Way to jump through hoops to get to that conclusion.", "YTA. There are reasons why people have been harsh. Your own post paints as you as an asshole- you tell us that you can\u2019t buy you child clothes that fit and tell him that he\u2019s \u201cstealing\u201d food, wtf my guy, especially to the latter. You say you\u2019re not badly off and that you expect your 15-year-old to pay for his basic necessities, again wtf. I\u2019m not sure what other judgment you thought you were going to get\u2026", "It\u2019s called you being delusional and not wanting to admit you don\u2019t have enough food in the house. Your pride is outweighing your hungry kids. Shame on you. YTA.", "You cannot admit that you are not providing sufficient food for your children. Which is a form of child abuser and neglect. CPS should be handling this.  Having enough peanut butter is not fancy. It\u2019s basic food. Why aren\u2019t you in food stamps? Why\u2019s rent you at the food bank? Why aren\u2019t you asking a local church or non profit for help and food donations?", "I'm absolutely floored at some of these responses too.  It's like all of the Hollywood writers that are on strike came here to keep their imagination active for when the strike is over.", "Underweight and his clothes are still too small.  Poor kid.  Then he gets yelled at for eating freaking peanut butter.", "That\u2019s true had he been an adult. But as children have lower BMI than adults, that height and weight for a 15 year old boy does not make him underweight. Though he is on the slimmer side.\n\nNonetheless, I agree with the rest as the kid obviously needs more food since he is hungry", "No it\u2019s not. It\u2019s thin, but it is not underweight for a 15 year old boy.", "A call about this would be screened out.", "The kid needs nutrition as well as calories. Protein, calcium, etc. Top Ramen isn't going to provide that. It is a good base for a meal with added meat and veggies, though.", "I do the best I can, applied for all the benefits allowed in my financial bracket. It's not like I came to reddit to help me figure out these things (though I do appreciate the advice). My children who work contribute to the household but I don't MAKE them buy anything. What the buy is theirs to keep (which is why I got on my 15-year-old about the stealing), if they didn't work they would still be fed and clothed.", "I\u2019ve experienced true poverty, and I\u2019ve worked with abused kids. Kids don\u2019t steal a jar of peanut butter, a whole jar, unless they are actually hungry. It sounds like OP may need food assistance but thinks he\u2019s too good for it so he chooses to starve his kids to salvage his pride. \n\nMy mom did that for a year. I lived off of oatmeal at home and school lunches for a year. I was 7. It sucked. She realized her pride was misguided and chose food for my brothers and me, and it was a great decision, though when I moved out on my own, I was hoarding food until it went bad in my fridge, and I had to sit myself down and convince myself that I was no longer starving and could buy less food so I wouldn\u2019t keep losing it to spoilage. \n\nThe point is you\u2019re not only causing your malnourished child short-term discomfort, you\u2019re also likely sabotaging his school performance and scarring him for life. You\u2019ll get out of him what you put in. \n\nGet some help or YTA.", "He\u2019s in the 16th percentile for a 15 year old\u2019s BMI - if he doesn\u2019t grow an inch before he turns 16 (not likely) he\u2019ll drop down to the 12th percentile - the kid is underweight.", "A starving child with ill fitting clothes? Not where I am. Neglect is also a form of abuse.", "Clothes that fit and enough food to eat is the bare minimum. Its not the kids fault that hes taller than his brothers but your attitude is to make it his responsibikity and not yours to solve. The kid ate an entire jar of peanut butter that was apparently off limits to him, and you somehow don't see that what you're willing to provide him is inappropriately low for just the basic needs you're supposed to provide?", "Yeah no, dude. If you're budgeting food to the point you consider him having a peanut butter sandwich 'stealing,' he's not being adequately fed. A 15 year old's priority should be his education, not working a job to supplement your income. It's your legal, moral and ethical responsibility to feed him, he is literally a child. Look into whatever social programs/food banks are available to you and stop letting your children go hungry because of your pride/inability to wrap your dick up.", ">if they didn't work they would still be fed and clothed.\n\nMate, no offence but this clearly isn't true.\n\nYou can't feed and clothe the 3 kids you currently have to provide for.\n\nHow the fuck would you provide for the extra two if they didn't work?", "I\u2019m a little lost, if he is your minor child, and the food you buy is for the family, how is him eating it stealing? Is it that the food is kept behind a locked door or Do you hand each child their food rations for the day?", "He\u2019s at school 40 hours a week. That is his job\u2026.", "Give us info. Where are you at? We need to CPS on you now!", "I know I\u2019ll get downvoted for literally stating facts but I\u2019m 6\u20195\u201d and 170, male, and according to doctors the low percentile I\u2019m at (around 8-10% body fat btw) it won\u2019t actually end up causing any long-term medical issues. Now I know everybody on Reddit is obviously a top-of-the-line medical expert that knows better than any doctor, but just offering up what I\u2019ve heard. Now, relevant to the story, this is bad. Very bad. Because it could be because he\u2019s underfed. How does this dad not see the fucking issue???", "Nope you\u2019re wrong. He\u2019s in the 21st percentile and underweight is less than 5th percentile, at least according to CDC. BMI less than 16.5 is underweight for a 15 year old boy, and this boy\u2019s BMI is ~18.\n\nFurther, you\u2019re seriously saying him getting taller will make him less underweight?", "you are very much at a poverty level if you are angry that your growing son is wearing clothes that are too small and you think peanut butter is fancy.  you say you go to food banks when necessary, but it is absolutely necessary every single week.  i realize you are trying here, but read these comments and instead of fighting with the people posting, listen and learn.  he is hungry, he needs clothes that fit, and you need to understand this", "Having one or two peanut butter sandwiches is fine, he ate the entire jar. It's not like peanut butter is the only thing in the house, either. There are other things, but a., there are foods he doesn't like, and b., when he does find something he likes he eats so much of it it's gone in a day. We go to food banks when need-be, I applied for social programs where we have eligibility.", "That's a great point! Can the kid qualify for free student breakfast and/or lunch? I did when I was younger. My sisters, who were significantly older, had to work in the cafeteria to get it but that would be the only non-voluntary \"job\" I could see myself agreeing with.", "I\u2019m an adult female that also falls in the underweight area - not critically underweight, BUT I\u2019m not in a growth stage of life. So unless I hit the critical point, as long as I have good muscle tone and no other physical side effects, it\u2019s not an issue. If I was a teenager, it would be problematic.", "I said if he doesn\u2019t grow an inch - run the CDC at 16yo, 6\u20192\u201d, 140 lbs. \n\nI used NIH numbers. Look, you can defend this AH for starving his child all you want, but the boy is not getting enough food to keep him at a healthy weight at a critical stage in skeletal, muscular and cerebral development. 5th percentile BMI is critically underweight - it\u2019s like the difference between being overweight vs obese (in the opposite direction).  It\u2019s possible (likely actually) that the son added a few inches recently, because otherwise I\u2019d expect a teacher/counselor/other mandated reporter to give a \u201chey, what\u2019s up\u201d talk to the kid or father.\n\nEdited to add:  Just discovered NIH assumes mid year, so if you put in 15 it matches CDC\u2019s 15 yr 6 mo.  Age progressed to 16 shows 12th (equal to CDC\u2019s 16 yr 0 mo) - if you start a new calculation with 16 it shows 9th percentile, which equals the CDC\u2019s 16 yr 6 mo - so that why the discrepancy in numbers. The above poster is correct that if the boy just turned 15 within the last month, he would be in the 21st percentile - so right on the borderline.  If he\u2019s been 15 for more than a month, he\u2019s in the underweight category.", "Gosh, it's almost like he's showing survival behaviours associated with food insecurity because he ISN'T GETTING ENOUGH TO EAT and what he is 'allowed' to eat is regulated out the ass by a father who is *not* getting it at all.", "Dude sorry to say you this, but maybe you thought about that different people can eat differently?\nYou said hes taller, so of course he needs more food, if he has a growth spurt or in general.\n\nAnd i dont get it, you would rather have him hungry, then have to buy more food.\nDude cmon if you cant handle it, search for more help.", "Stop arguing and parent", "Honest question: how is he stealing from his brothers when there's other food in the house? Why couldn't the brothers have eaten the other food, if they like it? If nobody likes it, why are you buying it?", "Because he is a growing teenage boy. And he is starving. Wow. You clearly are in denial.", "I mean im 19, but I\u2019ve stopped growing. Glad you also don\u2019t want to make being underweight (but not critically so) some apocalyptic, code-red all-hands-on-deck event", "So, what would you have me do? As I stated in other comments, we go to food banks, I've applied for assistance where we have eligibility, I buy as much food and clothes as I can afford for all my kids, and I'll add that yes, I ask for help from family and they do help me when they can. What else can I do? I'm all ears."]}
