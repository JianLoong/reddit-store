I have five boys, elder two (18 and 17) from a previous relationship, and the younger three with my late wife (15, 13, and 11). My 17 and 18-year-old both have jobs and contribute to buying their own food and clothes. My 15-year-old, we'll call him Jack, doesn't. I don't have a problem with this but it is relevant to the situation.\n\nWe're not badly off but I'm far from wealthy, and with five kids in the house I have to budget carefully. I can only buy but so much food and so many clothes, and the rule is unless you have your own money you have to accept what's there and that's it or there won't be enough to go around. (For those who'll say \u201cwell then should've had less kids\u201d, it's a bit late for that don't you think.) \n\nJack has been unable to keep a job, but that doesn't keep him from complaining about his clothes being too small/uncool and that he wishes he could eat like his friends (going out, nice restaurants, etc.). I understand, I grew up less fortunate than my friends as well and I hated it. But that doesn't mean I can magically change things.\n\nYesterday I came in from work and my younger sons tell me they were going to make PBJs but they can't find the peanut butter. I can't find it either so I end up asking my older sons and Jack. Turns out Jack not only ate the peanut butter but he's also been stealing food from his older brothers, too. I told Jack he was way old enough to know stealing is wrong and that he can't eat food that his little brothers need. He got annoyed and asked if I wanted him to start eating from garbage cans.\n\nNow I provide as best I can for all my children and while it could of course be better we're nowhere near the poverty level of the whole \u201ceating out the garbage\u201d trope. I told him the reality is that if he wants to buy fancy foods and snacks he's going to have to get a job and pay for them himself. He wasn't happy to hear this, but I think it needed to be said.

He just isn't buying name brand clothing or eating 5 star meals.  AND THAT'S ALRIGHT!\n\nLastly, OP never said that the kids HAVE to get jobs.  He just said that if you want more than what I am providing, you will need to pay for it yourself.  As long as OP IS providing for his kids, how does that not make sense?!?!\n\nOP - NTA.  I know it's rough out there and you are providing for your kids.  Maybe look into some benefit programs and see if there is anything out there for you that can only ADD to what you provide.

I have five boys, elder two (18 and 17) from a previous relationship, and the younger three with my late wife (15, 13, and 11). My 17 and 18-year-old both have jobs and contribute to buying their own food and clothes. My 15-year-old, we'll call him Jack, doesn't. I don't have a problem with this but it is relevant to the situation.\n\nWe're not badly off but I'm far from wealthy, and with five kids in the house I have to budget carefully. I can only buy but so much food and so many clothes, and the rule is unless you have your own money you have to accept what's there and that's it or there won't be enough to go around. (For those who'll say \u201cwell then should've had less kids\u201d, it's a bit late for that don't you think.) \n\nJack has been unable to keep a job, but that doesn't keep him from complaining about his clothes being too small/uncool and that he wishes he could eat like his friends (going out, nice restaurants, etc.). I understand, I grew up less fortunate than my friends as well and I hated it. But that doesn't mean I can magically change things.\n\nYesterday I came in from work and my younger sons tell me they were going to make PBJs but they can't find the peanut butter. I can't find it either so I end up asking my older sons and Jack. Turns out Jack not only ate the peanut butter but he's also been stealing food from his older brothers, too. I told Jack he was way old enough to know stealing is wrong and that he can't eat food that his little brothers need. He got annoyed and asked if I wanted him to start eating from garbage cans.\n\nNow I provide as best I can for all my children and while it could of course be better we're nowhere near the poverty level of the whole \u201ceating out the garbage\u201d trope. I told him the reality is that if he wants to buy fancy foods and snacks he's going to have to get a job and pay for them himself. He wasn't happy to hear this, but I think it needed to be said.

Sell any items you don't absolutely need. Downgrade your cell phone and computer and sell the nicer models. If you have a TV in your room or a video game console that is solely yours then sell them. Those are luxuries you don't need when you can't afford to take care of your kid's basic needs. Don't buy new clothes for yourself unless they're literally falling apart. Even then, get clothes from thrift stores or donation drives. Take public transport instead of driving to work if you drive. Cut down on the food you eat to one or two meals per day if you *genuinely* can't afford to feed your kids adequately. Your kids need the food more than you do since they're growing. If you're dating anyone then break it off. You need to focus your time, energy, and money on supporting your kids.\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, as a parent YOU need to make sacrifices to make sure your child's needs are met. Step up and be a better parent.\n\n\n\n\nETA just saw that your son is underweight. What you're doing is classified in most places as child neglect and/or abuse.

Nor is it an automatic reason to remove children.", "It's protein he needs, he's a growing child", "And what if they dont exist. What if this situation is just fucked.\n\n\nOPs income might be too a high, a common problem fpr people in the lower class who make too much to apply for social programs but have too little to make ends meet.", "I didn\u2019t see anyone say the PB was stolen", "Where did you get that he was underweight?", "Genuinely asking, was it mentioned somewhere that he's underweight?", "He\u2019s not severely underweight. He\u2019s just underweight. My son could have fit the same pants and shorts at 15 as he wore at 8, except they would be too short. Same with my brother, who is 6\u20193, when he was that age, and my nephew, who is 14 and 6\u20194. They also did things such as eat all the peanut butter, apple sauce, even bread, because it\u2019s convenient. They all ate a lot, and were growing. Does no one have teenaged boys?  It\u2019s often amazing in the amount of food it can take to fill them, especially during a growth spurt. \nMy boy is now turning 21, and he\u2019s still tall and skinny. Couple more years and he\u2019ll broaden out a bit.", "True. I was just pointing out that you can try to prepare but a lot of things are out of our control\n\nEdit: also want to add that they could have had huge medical bills that health insurance would never come close to paying for. Impossible to plan for every single thing that can go wrong", "LOL, thanks for chiming in, person who has clearly never used these services. Church religious services are open on weekends. Church CHARITY services - different from the religious ones - are often only open weekdays.", "If your kids are hungry and their clothes are too small, you\u2019re bad off.", "Neglect is *ignoring* a problem, whether by being unaware of it or not caring about it.\n\nIf you *just can't do anything about it*, that isn't neglect. It just fucking sucks. You can't spend money you don't have. Well, I suppose you can on credit, but if you don't have any way of paying it back, you're only delaying the problem briefly by creating a much, much bigger problem. \n\nI'm not saying it's *okay*, and I'll thank you to keep your words out of my mouth. They don't belong there. I'm saying it's not *neglect*.", "I assume you meant to reply to the post above me but yes I definitely do understand the concept of poverty and get to live it on a daily basis. Choosing which bill to ignore and having to skip meals so the kiddo always has food is bullsh*t but such is life and you make do", "This kid is lighter than you for his height and he\u2019s hoarding secret stashes of food, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of pocket to suggest that he might be going through food insecurity.", "[deleted]", "From the OPs comments", "[deleted]", "The dad stated that he figured his son was around 140lbs at 6\u20194\u201d, and u/StephSands claims that according to the BMI chart he\u2019s severely underweight. Given the fact that the BMI is a guide point, not the rule book, this statement is grossly mistaken. Is he skinny- sure. But not starving. \n\nMy BMI says I should be between 130-160lbs (depending on the website you use of course), but I\u2019m 190lbs. That doesn\u2019t make me \u201cseverely\u201d overweight. It doesn\u2019t factor in any muscle tone or anything else, just your weight and height.\n\nThe boy is fine.", "Okay. I will retract that and say he is underweight. \n\nThe fact that he is growing is the issue\u2026 He is not being allowed to eat what he needs.", "That\u2019s true. But the people here are literally using it to justify OP berating his kid for\u2026 eating?", "Or he\u2019s just cheap? He seems to think a 15 year old should work for peanut butter.", "You\u2019re absolutely correct, and although I didn\u2019t say it there due to a concerning lack of brain cells, in my following responses I mentioned how my situation is incomparable to the post. I think I was mistaken for leaving the comments in the first place honestly\u2026 I wasn\u2019t wrong about getting nuked though \ud83d\ude02", "Ok, I misunderstood what you meant with \u201cif he doesn\u2019t grow an inch\u201d. And yes if he stays the same height and weight as he gets older he will drop in percentiles the older he gets and eventually become underweight. That\u2019s what I\u2019m been saying all along.\n\nNIH and CDC both states that  BMI between 5th percentile and 85th percentile is healthy weight for a child. Looking at the BMI chart for children, and following the 5th percentile curve shows that it corresponds to a BMI of ~19 for a 20 year old - that is not critically underweight.\n\nCorrecting an incorrect fact is not defending OP.   My opinion is that OP gives the kid to little food, which I\u2019ve already written in the first post you replied to had you bothered to read it. However I do not need to base my opinion on incorrect facts.\n\nAccording to BMI the kid is not underweight, but BMI is just one measure and not necessarily always a very good one. That the kid is hungry and stealing food is all I need to know, to know that the child is not properly fed.", "Because it was food the other brothers bought with their money, not OP's.", "Woow. Yeah he's skinny", "He is also growing. I had a tall athletic son. He tracked his calories at 10,000 per day to maintain his weight. I appreciate OP is trying to treat his boys the same, but they are not the same. This child is hungry enough to eat an entire jar of peanut butter. YTA OP. Your children don\u2019t need brand name clothes or fancy dinners, but your son is hungry and his clothes don\u2019t fit. Your answer is for him to get a job?", "Wow, that is absolutely NOT ok. That is very thin.", "He's 6'2, so his bmi is actually 18. If he gained 5 lbs it would put him in \"normal\" weight range, but bmi has been proven to be bullshit. I had a bmi of 17 when i was 15 and I was eating 3 meals a day, another person can be literally starving and have a bmi of 25. The kid needs more food.", "At his age I was 6'6\" and 140ish. I ate a ludicrous amount and wasn't starving. I just grew up before I grew out. 17 BMI is fine at 15.", "Thanks for the answer.  That does seem a bit light for someone that tall, though I'm not sure the gauge for determining that it's \"severely\" underweight.", "[deleted]", "Thanks for the detailed explanation.  I had Googled what his BMI would be, but I know BMI isn't the best thing to go off of.", "That\u2019s why I say convenient. He\u2019s old enough to cook up some soup or pirogies,  even make tacos or something. He\u2019s probably like a lot of us were at that age, and whine they\u2019re starving when too much effort is needed. \nClothes being small sucks, but it\u2019s hard to tell. Maybe the kid has grown a lot in a short time, not unheard of at that age, and it can be hard to keep up. More info is needed to really tell at this point.  It\u2019s not ideal, but it doesn\u2019t sound insane. Just life with boys."]}
