They are not part of the wedding or anything like that.  I wasn't going to invite them but my grandfather asked me to please let my biomom be a part of my day.  \n\nAbout a week ago I spoke with my biodad. He wants a plus one on their invitation.

Apparently him and my mother have a man in his 30s that is a part of their relationship.  \n\nWhile neither myself or my fiance are particularly religious, and I have no objections to polygamous relationships in general, I would prefer not to have to deal with that at my wedding.  \n\nI told him that he and my mother were invited as a courtesy and that they had no parental privileges for me to consider.  He said that excluding their partner was mean and that he wouldn't have left me with my grandparents if he knew they were going to raise me to be prejudiced.  \n\nI have spoken with my grandparents about this. Both sets. Nobody knew anything about this. So it seems that they were going to use my wedding to introduce this guy to the families.  \n\nI called him back and was very firm.

I also spoke with the manager and explained that I might have uninvited guests trying to get into my wedding reception. He said that security would escort anyone like that off the property and call the cops if needed. \n\nAll of this was relayed to my parents.  Now they are complaining to everyone. I am dealing with it by telling everyone who calls me to fight for them exactly why I am excluding the person they want to bring.  \n\nI just talked to my mother and she screamed at me for telling people her private business. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT. \n\nAdding in that all my guests get a plus one unless I invited them as a couple or as a family.", "created_utc": 1671049252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm14xc/aita_for_excluding_my_parents_throuple_partner/", "score": 1371, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your life.", "\"While neither myself or my fiance are particularly religious, and I have  \n no objections to polygamous relationships in general, I would prefer   \nnot to have to deal with that at my wedding.\"\n\nOne, it sounds like you do have an objection if you see it as something to \"deal with\"?\n\nTwo, myself is used for reflexive phrases, things that YOU do to YOURself.", "YTA yeah sure it's weird but respect their choices.", "I did a literal double take when reading that. The sheer gall and obliviousness it must've taken on the part of OP's dad to say that... Truly breathtakingly arrogant", "Right? Gold star for \u201cHow to reveal you are a shitty human being in one sentence\u201d", "This is the angle I see it from too. \n\nOPs wedding is not the place to introduce their new partner to their extended family, let alone to their child.\n\nOP shouldn't have to have the wedding upstaged by drama simply because these people are too cheap and/or lazy to host events and visit their family.", "This is what I find the most hilarious. The mom is only mad because they were definitely going to use the wedding to flaunt their relationship. The audacity of them all.", "Ahahaha that was my thought also. You can\u2019t lose your mind that your \u201cprivate business\u201d has been shared while also wanting to publicly parade that same business at someone else\u2019s wedding, I\u2019m actually here chuckling to myself at the audacity, poor OP, hopefully you can laugh about this later.

Uninvite them both, and have a serious talk with your grandparents about why they want you to keep such people close to you.", "That's not a +1 that's a +spouse. A +1 is an open invitation to include a non marital partner, bf/gf or even just a friend.", "> I have no objections to polygamous relationships in general, I would prefer not to have to deal with that at my wedding.\n\nAs a gay person, I've heard very similar statements to this. Obviously there's other stuff going on here, but that phrase comes across as casual, ugly bigotry despite the \"I have no objections\" qualifier.", "It's awesome that you're giving plus ones, but dad is asking for a plus 2.", "Nta. You are under no obligation to include them at all, nor their partner. I think it\u2019s been pretty well established that they are self centered AHs. They abandoned you to go \u201clive their lives\u201d and have no right to demand anything. Then to try to make you and your grandparents, who love you and are kind enough to raise you FOR them, look badly is just a clear indicator they will never make you a priority. \n\nThank goodness they didn\u2019t raise you, at least they had sense enough to leave you in wonderful hands.", "Yeah at this point invite the dude and uninvite the parents, we'll be virtually the same with one less mouth to pay catering for.", "Especially couples who abandoned their child do not get a plus one.", "Don't second guess yourself. You are completely in the clear. I would even consider asking them to bow out and decline their invitation or you will take them off the guest list.", "Tell your bio-parents that they were invited because the parents who actually raised you (aka your grandparents) asked you to.  So technically your bios are your grandparents \u201cplus ones\u201d and \u201cplus ones\u201d don\u2019t get a \u201cplus one\u201d!", "You said your parents were invited as a courtesy. Courtesy invites don\u2019t get a +1", "And unfortunately, it probably doesn't mean that they would have kept her with them. It probably means they would have dumped her somewhere else.", "Well, based on the fact that their new man is in his thirties, we can conclude that OP's mom likes her men young...", "LOL Heinlein sure had a lot of...unconventional ideas about sex and relationships.", "I\u2019ve already written Heinlein off my reading list but I\u2019m curious enough now to potentially add him back in. Is it worth reading, well, Heinlein?", "Other way around. The mom is older.", "Well put and very funny! I think you've zeroed in on the fact this is a stunt--they were planning to use her wedding to get attention.\n\nNTA", "Exactly. That\u2019s the point (or a big point) of plus 1. It\u2019s 1 plus 1 not 2 plus 1.", "I noticed that, too.

I\u2019m absolutely appalled at what he said to OP. He\u2019s disgusting. Definitely have a heart to heart with grandparents over this.", "At this point, I think it would be perfectly acceptable for OP to uninvite her \"parents\". \n\nThe gall on them to turn her wedding into a coming out party for them and then complain that she beat them to it when they send their flying monkeys to brow beat her into giving them their way.\n\nThe real cherry on top of this shit Sunday is bio dad claiming they wouldn't have abandoned OP if he knew it would result in not getting his way at her wedding. \n\nI mean, wow. So now he's insulted his own parents by insinuating they are bigots, insulted himself and his wife by implying they left their child to be raised by bigots, and insulted OP by insinuating that if only she behaved as a bigot as a child they wouldn't have abandoned her?\n\nThe mental gymnastics boggle the mind! \n\nPersonally, I think this would be the straw that broke the \"no contact\" camel's back for me, OP.\n\nI hope you have a fabulous wedding and cut out anyone who doesn't support whatever decisions you make about your bio parents!", "And regardless of the standard, it's up to you who you want to invite. it's already very generous to invite the parents who abandoned you.", "In general I would say a throuple should be invited together but in this specific case they shouldn\u2019t have the nerve to ask OP for anything.", "I don\u2019t have much knowledge about poly relationships but I think I know enough to say that OP\u2019s bios are being jerks which has zero to do with who they sleep with. Poor OP. She doesn\u2019t deserve this", "Am I doing my math right? Dad was 19 and mom was 29 when they had OP?", "apparently not", "So gross", "Time Enough For Love takes the prize. He has sex with sex-changed clones of himself. Yuck.", "Honestly I think it depends on what you want out the reading. Many of Heinlein's books have not aged well, he was sexist, a war hawk and held political views that I would describe as \"enlightened despotism\" at best all of which are reflected in his works. So if you're looking for books that paint an inspiring view of humanity's future then he's not a good author to read.\n\nHowever he was very influential in early science fiction so I think it's worth reading some of his books to understand the history of the genre. I've only read a few of his books and while I doubt if I'll bother to read more of them I don't regret reading the ones that I did.\n\nSo I guess my answer is: maybe.", "Tell your father that the price of his boy toy\u2019s admission is 18 year\u2019s worth of back child-support.", "Agreed.  The traditional blessing is \u2018congratulations to the groom and best wishes to the bride\u2019.  With respect to OP, my intent was to wish congratulations to whomever won her heart and best wishes to her.", "Ikr they abandoned her and their parents stepped up for the child! And sounds like they didn't pay for anything for her too... They're not her parents tbh, just donor", ">The real cherry on top of this shit Sunday is bio dad claiming they wouldn't have abandoned OP if he knew it would result in not getting his way at her wedding.\n\nThis is the comment that had me rolling. If you read it carefully, \"He said that excluding their partner was mean and that he wouldn't have left me with my grandparents if he knew they were going to raise me to be prejudiced.\"\n\nHe either 1) implies that they would have raised her themselves or 2) he implies they would have had someone else do the raising.\n\nEither way, it's a hilarious (in a morbid way) comment to make and beyond fucked up for a plethora of reasons.\n\nThat alone would have had me uninviting them myself. \n\nNTA", "John Lennon vibes lol", "You should sit down with your grandparents and any other relatives you actually care about and have a heart to heart with them, cause is not worth it all this stress for people that only add negative things in your life.", "You gotta make sure they don\u2019t try to hijack someone else\u2019s plus one to bring this dude.
