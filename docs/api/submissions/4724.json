They are not part of the wedding or anything like that.  I wasn't going to invite them but my grandfather asked me to please let my biomom be a part of my day.  \n\nAbout a week ago I spoke with my biodad. He wants a plus one on their invitation.

Apparently him and my mother have a man in his 30s that is a part of their relationship.  \n\nWhile neither myself or my fiance are particularly religious, and I have no objections to polygamous relationships in general, I would prefer not to have to deal with that at my wedding.  \n\nI told him that he and my mother were invited as a courtesy and that they had no parental privileges for me to consider.  He said that excluding their partner was mean and that he wouldn't have left me with my grandparents if he knew they were going to raise me to be prejudiced.  \n\nI have spoken with my grandparents about this. Both sets. Nobody knew anything about this. So it seems that they were going to use my wedding to introduce this guy to the families.  \n\nI called him back and was very firm.

I also spoke with the manager and explained that I might have uninvited guests trying to get into my wedding reception. He said that security would escort anyone like that off the property and call the cops if needed. \n\nAll of this was relayed to my parents.  Now they are complaining to everyone. I am dealing with it by telling everyone who calls me to fight for them exactly why I am excluding the person they want to bring.  \n\nI just talked to my mother and she screamed at me for telling people her private business. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT. \n\nAdding in that all my guests get a plus one unless I invited them as a couple or as a family.", "created_utc": 1671049252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm14xc/aita_for_excluding_my_parents_throuple_partner/", "score": 2557, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He knows I've had dozens of surgeries due to a rare genetic condition that causes me to form constant kidney stones, and the one time I call to ask for help, he refused me.\n\nI don't want to waste my time going over all the hurtful, casual cruelties of my family who can't seem to figure out What WOULD Jesus Do? \n\nBlood doesn't mean anyone is entitled to anything.  Love, being there when no one else would come, always having time for you.  Those carry much more obligation than blood.\n\nYour Bio-p's want to abandon you up until you are getting married, and decide they want to show up, steal the show so that everyone can see the freak flag still flies. (I mean that in a funky 70's, Rick James kinda way).  Is this why they gave birth, so you could provide them with a stage when they want one, but not have to actually earn it?  \n\nIf this other person is so important, they should find a way of hosting a party and introducing him.\n\nAnd despite my Pentecostal upbringing, when it comes to sex, as long as it involves willing ADULTS, and no one is physically harmed, then, do you.  But your daughter's wedding is not your coming out party.\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA and you would be within your rights to rescind their invitation. Talk to your grandfather about it first though.", "So I had a poly coworker. She never announced it, partly because the place was full of socially conservative peeps. She and I were talking about another coworker who was forward with her sexual proclivities and she told me about her triad. Whatevs. Party on, my friends. \nAnyway...\n\nNTA. The most important fact is it's your wedding, and they haven't even been a big part of your life. They're looking for attention. Let them announce their throuple on Facebook or something.", "Nta - your wedding isn\u2019t your parents opportunity to reveal their surprise. Much like someone hijacking a wedding to propose or announce a pregnancy.", "NTA, obviously. But I think it's funny that your mom is angry you're sharing why you're not inviting your parents' partner. How was she planning on introducing him at wedding?", "NTA. Aside from everything else, I think a \u201cno wedding guests I haven\u2019t met\u201d is an entirely reasonable policy if you\u2019d like it to be your policy, especially when it comes to strangers attached to not so treasured guests", "Absolutely NTA and I'm low-key creeped out that the boyfriend is probably as close to you in age as he is your bio dad. Mom 56, dad 46, boyfriend 30something (32? 37? Makes a slight difference but not much) and then you the daughter at 27.\nEdit: mixed up the bio donor ages", "By far NTA", "We are going to need an update on how the wedding goes!", "NTA\n\nYour (bio) parents are, for better or worse, your (bio) parents, and you made a nice gesture to invite them even though they pawned you off to your grandparents.   They respond to your polite invite with \"invite our boyfriend too\"?  No.  You don't know their +1, and you barely invited them.   They seem to have a need to make everything in their life about them.  You're a nuisance?   Get rid of you.  Invited to a wedding?  Let us make a loud spectacle about a couple not having a +1.\n\nPfft.  Rescind their invitation.", "NTA. They are incredibly selfish and self-centered. Wowza!", "NTA your 'parents' are incredibly entitled and who wants some random person included to create drama with your parents. SMH here's some cake \ud83c\udf82", "NTA, this is not something that should be dumped on family at an event like a *wedding*. Introducing other partners is something that should be done at a separate time, even if it's at a lunch or a dinner, so all the usual questions can be answered without taking away from another event (like this). You don't have an obligation to them *anyway*, they had basically no part in raising you, they **abandoned you** as a child. They don't get to turn your wedding into a coming out party..", "Nta \n\nThey were basically making YOUR special day all about them. They didn't wanna come to support the daughter they abandoned, they were using it as an opportunity to introduce their new boyfriend. They probably thought it was strategic because people will be less likely to cause a scene at a wedding. \n\nMaybe this would've been fine if they had actually been a part of your life but treating you as an opportunity instead of a person is low. \n\nI hope you're doing ok.", "NTA.  They can be polyamorous on their own time.  It's incredibly crass for wedding guests to ask to add another party to the guest list.  Frankly, the \"breeders\" (a term used by a friend's therapist to describe people who bred but didn't do much else for their kids) should be told that you invited them only because you love your grandfather enough to tolerate them in order to honor his wishes.  \n\nAs for your mother's whining about you telling her \"private\" business, how was she planning to explain his presence at the wedding?  \"Oh, him?  He's just some random stranger we picked up on the side of the road and brought with us.\"  If they are going to engage in such a relationship, they should be willing to take ownership and face whatever consequences come their way.  \n\nIf your breeders continue to behave badly, ask your grandfather if he would be willing to reconsider his request.  He might be amenable to uninviting them.  After all, he didn't know about the situation before he made the request and it's entirely possible he's secretly mortified but not sure how to get out of the situation.  If that's the case, politely but firmly tell the breeders that their bad behavior has shortened your guest list by two and that they will be ejected if they should show up.", "NTA \n\n\n> He said that excluding their partner was mean and that he wouldn't have left me with my grandparents if he knew they were going to raise me to be prejudiced\n\nOh, how nice!!!\n\nI don\u2019t care what hate I receive, polyamory isn\u2019t an orientation, it\u2019s absolutely a choice and they don\u2019t get a 3rd seat", "NTA. Good job OP. I have had it with parents who have children and don\u2019t bother to do jack shit then turn around and expect their kids to give them any sort of slack. Your parents are selfish and I am so glad you had/have your grandparents. Have a wonderful wedding, congrats, and give yourself some kudos for being firm in your boundaries.", "Also the attention the parents are going to get for being poly (since no one in the family knew) is going to be a huge distraction, whether positive or negative. It\u2019s a really selfish move.", "Yep, just uninvite those mofo\u2019s", "It *is* something to deal with.  She is already dealing with her absentee parents being there in the first place, as she had no desire to invite them in the first place.  It was a courtesy to her grandparents.  \n\nSecondly, her absentee parents were planning on using *her* wedding as a venue to unveil their relationship.  That's shitty on its face in the first place, but especially when nobody knew that they were in a poly relationship.  The focus of this event is to be on the wedded couple, not the parents.  That is  in such poor taste.  I couldn't possibly care any less about anybody's sexual lifestyle either.  If I married my partner,  for example, my kid's friend, who is like a son to me, would get a +2 for his 2 BFs for example. But if I were involved in this exact situation, this would also be a \"fuck no\" from me as well.   Not everything is discrimination.\n\nThirdly, it is poor form to correct someone's grammar when you're doing it to nitpick because you disliked what they said.    Come off it.", "NTA is it\u2019s OPs choice not to invite the person.", "Just save the hassle and uninvite them.\n\nThey're not parents.\n\nThey're not friends.\n\nThey're not respectful of you or your plans for *your* wedding.\n\nThey established years ago that no relationship was what they wanted. Honor that wish. Tell your grandfather you attempted, but the drama they're already interjecting is too much for you.", "Ultimately though you only agreed to invite your parents as a courtesy to your grandparents. You\u2019ve upheld your end of the bargain and owe them nothing, especially when they want to use your wedding as an excuse to parade around a boyfriend. \n\nIf your bio mom doesn\u2019t want people knowing her \u201cprivate business\u201d why is she so set on bringing this guy to a wedding where she knows everyone? I\u2019m guessing as your grandfather specified wanting your bio mom there, she\u2019s their daughter. So she knows everyone will find out. My guess is they were hoping to cause drama by showing up with the boyfriend in tow to get a reaction. So by telling everyone the situation beforehand, you\u2019ve effectively ruined it for them. \n\nNTA but I\u2019d just uninvite them to save the hassle. Even if they don\u2019t try to bring in the other guy, you don\u2019t know how they might behave out of spite.", "Well there you go then. Your parents are a couple, and you invited them without a +1, the same as all the other couples. The fact that they have another relationship partner is not relevant here, because that man is a stranger to you. And I\u2019m saying this as a poly person- if your parents want to introduce their partner to the family at a family event, then they can host their own event to do so. They don\u2019t need to hijack the wedding of the child they decided not to raise. If the situation were different, if you were closer with them and had met their partner even *once* I could see an argument for making an exception (assuming you even like the guy). But as is, you have zero obligation to even invite them, never mind their partner.", "So it sounds like your husband should get a plus one too, jkjk", "Giving an individual a plus one so they have a date is normal. When you invite a couple, they are going with each other and don\u2019t get to bring anyone else. Invited couples do not get a plus one!!\nNTA. And I hope your wedding is wonderful.", "That is totally different. Even though your parents never settled down, they count as a couple. They don't need a +1.", "I am late to respond, am sorry, but wanted to ask you, how are you telling everyone their business? Who were they going to introduce this third party as? They are upset you mentioned their business, yet are upset you aren\u2019t invited someone no one knew about? Make up their mind!", "Not sure why your mom is upset about you sharing her business when she was going to use your wedding for the big reveal. NTA. Congrats and best wishes for your wedding!", "You are not obligated to host all of your parent's sex partners. You invited the people you know, period. Not only is this stranger not invited, but they also are not allowed to use your wedding as a coming out party. Is your mother angry because you outed them or because you ruined her plans? They can be as free-spirited as they want -- somewhere else. They wanted a free party all about them. NTA", "So what? Your wedding, your rules. If they don't like it, they are more than welcome not to attend. They have absolutely zero right to dictate ANYTHING here.\n\nYou also don't need to give them any explanation for your decision., nor do you need to engage further. If they want to spin some ridiculous narrative behind your back, let them. Anyone who knows you at all is going to see right through their BS.", "Your assumption that my correction was motivated by disliking the comment was incorrect and is verifiable by my comment history. Good guess though.", "No, the sperm and egg donors are grandpa's and grandma's plus ones since grandpa was the one to insist on them getting an invite.", "I see them as the grandparents\u2019 plus one", "This is the only acceptable answer.\n\nTopping off that the sperm donor and incubator are choosing OP's wedding to \"come out\" so to speak. They are making this about them. \n\nNTA", "This is awful. I am sorry you can't unheard it. I hope you told him you considered it the best thing they could have done so you didn't turn out an AH like him.", "Definitely not fair or right.", "Here's a summary video of one of his books by a really fun youtube channel!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3jAkplrZci0\n\nEdit: The content of the book is still horrifying and somewhat disturbing.", "He has amazing ideas about science fiction, and some terrible ideas about human interaction and society in general. He\u2019s in the boat with Lovecraft and Card, I\u2019d say overall worth reading just because of how influential he\u2019s been. Just read with a grain of salt.", "What makes you think that I would peruse your post history just because I chose to respond to your comment?  That's hardly the main point here anyway.", "[removed]", "Yes! Best andwer", "no, no - there was only one shot that got the chandelier. That\u2019s one plus two plus one plus one", "You know that the Happy Throuple would be all over each other like middle schoolers who haven't figured out what level of physical intimacy is appropriate PDA.", "They never cared about their daughter and wanted to be live a selfish life with no child rearing responsibilities.  This doesn't surprise me.", "\u201cFor shame! Your mother and I abandoned you better than this!\u201d\n\nPause for quick math, HE was 19 and SHE was 29 when OP was born, suggesting a bit of a weird dynamic from the start.", "This entire situation, as you so beautifully described it, is why people get so pissed off at the extreme left (and I'm pretty liberal!). When you're so left that it actually turns into prejudice against anyone who doesn't embrace your same 'I'm a true nudist at heart so whhhyyyy can't I be naked at your wedding?! philosophy (okay, not exactly this situation but you get my point), you *really* need to take a step back and examine your philosophy, dude.", "I would say to them couples don\u2019t get a 3rd wheel. Am so sorry your parents are AH. Also anyone saying oh just let them come are AH also.", "Ikr? Now that her husband is no longer young, she is looking  another one...", "Hey so I am very anti age-gaps.... until everyone is in their 30s. At that point it largely stops being predatory. Can it be emotionally manipulative or abusive? Of course. But when all the parties are full-fledged adults, well.", "And the girl he raises from childhood! Loved the book but, wow, Heinlein..", "I read all of Heinlein's books in my teen years, he was hugely influencial to me growing up. Politically he falls somewhere between Leonardo Da Vinci and Ayn Rand. He believed in social responsibility and also that people should be free to do whatever they want as long as it isn't hurting anyone else. Regarding the  polygomous relationships in his stories, I don't think he was actually advocating those so much as predicting them. He also predicted mobile phones. He was a science fiction writer after all. In fact the line marriage he wrote about ended badly for his character.", "Honestly the other guy might be the best guest of the three. He is the only one of them that didn't skip out on his parental obligations to OP.", "And that matters how? I mean, it's a choice.

To me that's just a stones throw too far. \n\n\"Poor me, I abandoned my kid, still got a wedding invite, and am low class enough to bring up the fact that I abandoned my kid as a weapon to get my way about their wedding.\"\n\nIt's insane!", ">I'm going with \"someone else\" doing the raising.  This pair of bio-donors suck.", "They run their mouths off to family because FaMiLy neglecting the fact **THEY DID NOT RAISE HER**\n\nWhy would this birth giver and sperm donor get any special accommodations and think they deserve it? \n\n(Btw love the morbid way comment)", "I don\u2019t see that as inherently predatory but what is predatory is the father being 19 when OP was born and the mother being 29.
