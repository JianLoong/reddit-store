You were doing what everyone else was wanting you to do.\n\nPart of the problem here is that neither of you, nor your grandpa, were in charge of the group.  Since your sister is so close to you in age, she feels she is an equal unless it is made clear that you are in charge of her.", "NTA.

But you are not an AH for rightfully being upset at your ?jealous? sister.\n\nI tried several times to give a suggestion on what to do only to realize I'm a horribly petty person and your sister is a child. Maybe ask your parents if they can watch the fireworks with just you after sister ruined the whole thing; or one if they need to always be with the toddler. Good luck whatever you decide.\n\nE: I know they said one night, but after it got ruined, surely everyone doesn't need to go again just you and a parent?

If she was so concerned about the trip going well for everyone, why did she ruin it for you? Aren't you part of everyone? I think she doesn't want to admit to her role in this, and she may be too immature to even recognize that her actions had consequences or an impact on you.\n\nGrowing up, I repeatedly had important experiences ruined by my younger siblings and my parents were always telling me I needed to be the bigger person and not make a big deal out of things. I had to put my needs aside a lot. If this is or ends up being your experience, I recommend making a list of things you want to revisit as an adult. \n\nIt's a lot harder to have those magic moments when you're with your family and so many things are beyond your control, but you're going to be an adult soon(ish) - you can make those moments for yourself.

I hope you didn't let this ruin your whole trip and you were able to get a souvenir from each land. I know in another year, your sister will have her own special day.

I've amended it to NTA and edited my comment above, because that's not being mopey. If you're just ignoring her and not making life difficult for anyone, sounds like you're in the clear.\n\nI understand feeling sad then, could be a mix of memories about the first night and leaving when you've had a nice time there?

That's what my cousin and I ended up doing, left her in the dust. I would suggest doing a day where you arrive to the park LATE so the older people don't get winded and you can go specifically to see the fireworks again!

She was being selfish, and didn't care about how her behavior was impacting you and the group. Hopefully she will apologize at some point, but I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nCan I offer a suggestion though? I see from your comments that your parents aren't willing to deal with crowds again, but my favorite way to watch the fireworks at the magic kingdom actually skips the parks. Perhaps they would be open to this suggestion: Go and watch it at the beach on the Polynesian resort. You get the full  experience of seeing the fireworks above the castle (actually easier to see all of them), and any projections they do on the castle are still detailed enough to be visible at a distance. The audio from the show is also piped into the speakers that are surrounding the beach. After the fireworks are done, there is an electric lights show on a series of boats/barges that roams around the resorts on the lake that is also a lot of fun. When I was a small child, we would grab an ice cream from the Polynesian cafeteria and do this. And I still consider this magical as an adult, that I've taken dates to do this too.\n\nIf you're staying at a Disney resort, this is not difficult to do. Just hop onto a bus to the Polynesian at any of the parks. If you're staying off property and are using a car, you can get access to the Polynesian by making a reservation at any of the restaurants located in the Polynesian. (Dinner and a show!)\n\nRegardless, I hope you're having fun on your trip, and congratulations on turning 15! If the fireworks don't happen this time, I promise there will be other opportunities in the future if you make it a goal. Feel free to be mad at your sister as long as you want, but when you're ready, let the anger go. Life is more fun that way. Happy to pass along more Disney tips too, btw. I've been there many times.", "Her sister is an ass but what the hell is with this sub and labeling everyone a narcissist? I don\u2019t even think you can diagnose a minor with that", "You mean while the grandparents stay behind with the two toddlers.", "Then ask them to discipline their other daughter for ruining a trip that was meant for you.\n\nAka tell them to parent up.", "Stay by yourself. At 15, you'll be fine.", "Why are you so condescending?", "Oh yes. This calls for revenge served cold.\n\nYeah, it's petty and mean and they're still kids but even not coming from the culture I have read enough to know how important the quince is and her sister deliberately made a scene and made her miss an experience she's looked forward to. Sometimes petty and mean is the only possible way.\n\nNTA. I'm sorry she ruined it for you. Get her back."]}
