Because of this upgrade I've been really happy and just wanted to share that with those close to me, so I invited my family to have lunch this past Sunday. \n\nImportant to note that my boyfriend (21 M) and I live together, we have live together for six months now, and been together for about year and half, we're doing great and the future looks amazing and promising with him. I do see myself getting married to him. \n\nThe issue came this Sunday, we we're having lunch and everyone was having a good time, just what I wanted. My boyfriend had to leave cause he was going to see his little brother's football game, after he left my mother (37 F) started asking if I could afford the apartment without him and if the lease was on my name. \n\nI told her that I could afford it, and that everything was ok with the lease. She said \"good, now I can rest easy\", now, normally this wouldn't be so bad but she said it in this snarky and passive-agressive tone that didn't went unnoticed by anyone, things at the table immediately got uncomfortable. \n\nI asked what she meant by that, and she replied with \"well, I assume you want to stay in this place for a long time, it is really nice, and I just wanted to be sure that when you finally decide to break up with bf you won't have to leave\".\n\nShe has never been the kindest person in the planet, she hasn't been the kindest to my bf, but at least not Infront of people, and never like this. So I asked to please stop saying things like that from now on, that it was mean. \n\nOf course, she had to make it worse by saying something along the lines of \"oh please, I just meant that you guys will break up when you finally get over that whole 'i don't want kids mindset' because he can't have any\".\n\nFor context, my bf got a vasectomy this year. Also, I've been saying since I'm 16 that I don't want any children, but she insists on the whole \"you'll change your mind\" as she believes that there is nothing greater for women than to be mothers. \n\nHer comment made me angry, everyone on the table was uncomfortable. My grandmother tried to divert the conversation, but I wasn't having it. \n\nI got up from the table, asked her as calmly as possible to please leave and went to cut the dessert. She said a comment about my temper and her not been able to voice her concerns, and left along my father and sisters. After, my grandmother said I was being rude and that I know how my mother is, that I shouldn't had said anything and just brush it off, but my aunt agreed with what I did. \n\nMy mother sent my a long text yesterday saying that she was waiting for an apology and that she won't visit me again because I was mean to her and made her cry. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit to add info: I said this in a comment, but she was very worried before knowing of his vasectomy out of the fear of not having white babies (my bf is brown). \n\nMy bf is great, we have a very healthy relationship and he has always been polite and helpful with my family, he was very nice to my mother until he overheard her made a comment to a friend about \"he is handsome... But in a brown way\" and after that he keeps his distance, rightfully so.

They know that the other person is wrong but they expect you to suck it up, buttercup, and just deal with it. \"That's just how she is\" is how entitled people are made. People just let them get away with everything and you have to put up and shut up. It would be great if people just stopped letting others get a free pass on things because \"that's just the way they are\". \n\nYour mother's text after the fact sounds very emotionally manipulative. Stand firm in setting your boundaries. She needs to know that she needs to respect you, your boyfriend, and your decision not to have children. It's not up for debate.", "NTA. Your mother was very out of line.  Something similar happened to me about 35 years ago, but it was my grandmother, not my mom.  \n\nWe were in my new apartment, having lunch at my tiny little dining room table.  My grandmother started to badmouth my father, who was away on business.  I told her to shut her mouth.  Then I took her in her wheelchair and wheeled her out of my apartment into the hallway and halfway to the elevator.  I told her she is not welcome in my home if she badmouths my father.  I turned on my heel and walked back into my apartment, to see my mother with her mouth hanging open in shock.

It is a matter of wanting to make sure your children are thinking about their finances and their future. \n\nHowever, she took it to a personal level.

If this is new behavior from her (talking about it in front of others) there's likely a few reasons she's done so: 1) the most likely option, she's testing your boundaries to see what she can and can't get away with. This is a classic narc tactic, especially when they see their control slipping. DO NOT APOLOGIZE. This will only make her become more bold. Don't back down, show her that what she did was wrong.\n2) She's trying to drive a wedge between you and him. Likely, she was hoping that others would agree with her. Given grandmas comment, she likely agrees, but doesn't want to say it outright, be careful with her.\n3) she's secretly jealous of your decision to be child free, and is trying to sabotage the relationship because of it.\n\nThough, there's also a (high) possibility that a few of these play into the overall reason. My advice: *firmly* explain to her that as she was the agressor in this confrontation, you will not apologize, and in fact the *only* way she will ever be allowed in your house again is to not only apologize, but to promise to never say such things again. Personally, I'd also make her apologize to the bf, as he was also (technically) a wounded party in this discussion.", "NTA \n\nSo your mother is allowed to be asshole to you in the home YOU pay for and SHARE with your partner but you have to take it because\u2026she\u2019s an asshole.

Well done for standing up for yourself, it's so boring hearing constantly 'when are you having children' 'you'll change your mind'. Child bearing is savage on a woman's body and they are hard work, not everyone wants that and not everyone wants children. It's very responsible to make the decision not to have children if you don't want them rather than having a child just because society says you should want to. \nYou were not rude, your mother was rude for undermining your stance on children and for doing this in front of people in some sort of power play.

I know this is an advanced yoga level stretch here, but it wouldn't surprise me if your mom is jealous of you. \n\nShe chose motherhood over all else, she chose to have you at age 16/17 herself, and she wants validation that \"motherhood\" is the best and right choice. \n\nI'm a mom myself. I'm 33 and I am divorced with 2 daughters. I was hell bent on being a mother, I really really wanted it. Now, I totally understand. My identical twin is child-free by choice, as is my brother. I completely understand all the medical, ethical, financial, mental health, etc. reasons not to have kids. I am super happy to be a mom, but it obviously comes with many challenges. My daughters are only 7 and 4, and I've made it very clear that they absolutely do not have to have children of they don't want to, and that it's perfectly normal for their aunt and uncle to choose not to have children, despite my girls wishing they had some cousins.\n\nBut some people get really angry when someone does something different from them and are happy about it. It's like when someone chooses to be sober, either long term or just for a night, and people who drink heavily or have actually full blown problem drinking behaviors get really uncomfortable because they feel like someone choosing not to drink is inadvertently an insult at *their* choices. They're subconsciously aware of the fact that they have or had other options (like sobriety, or choosing not to have children), so it creates this cognitive dissonance. They've tried to convince themselves that the way they do things is correct and leads to happiness, so seeing someone else happy with an opposite choice is extremely unsettling. \n\nIt sounds like she judges your level of \"success\" as far as if you did exactly what she did. She wants to feel superior. If you become a mother, she becomes the \"expert\" over you. If you choose to live child-free and pursue careers or passions she knows nothing about, she can never hold the power of her \"life expertise\" over you, because you dared to figure out a different path for yourself. \n\nI hope you're able to go NC for a while and formulate some good boundaries to stay strong. It sounds like your mom is the \"boat rocker\" in that \"don't rock the boat\" analogy I see shared here often.

Likewise, I respect her choices.

You're still NTA for speaking up, but it's obvious that your mother is a racist **and** that you have relationship issues that you're not sure how to solve. She can be a racist **and also right** that there's issues there. You're still NTA, but it sounds like she sees those issues and realizes it means the relationship probably won't last - she might be wrong, but then you become a bit more wrong to react so strongly.

Ignore anyone you don't know. Of the people pictured, who is still with the person they were with at the time of the photo. That's data collection. Coming up with a percentage and determining whether that figure is indicative of the general population is statistics. \n\nLooking at the yearbook and remembering is data collection. The arithmetic is statistics.", "If I've learn anything dealing with her temper and her comments since I gained critical thinking, is that she will always find something to nag about. \n\nIf not me, then my dad or my grandma, she doesn't mess with my aunt's or grandpa cause she knows they won't allow it, and I'm very tired of being on the 'I can mistreat' list.", "Oh I've heard a handful of stories like that haha.\n\nI also have an implant, and will continue to have birth control because of hormonal issues of my own, so if any pregnancy can beat a vasectomy and birth control I'll just have the child haha, they may cure cancer or something.", "I said this in another comment, but she was very worried before knowing of his vasectomy out of the fear of not having white babies (my bf is brown). I didn't put this on the OG post cause frankly I am embarrassed my mother is like this", "Idk, the thing is we had one issue that was resolved in like two days, and she knows nothing about it because I don't share with her. \n\nHe's been really great, he's struggling with depression and made a bad decision, I forgave him, we moved on and we're happy and the relationship is healthy, but still, she doesn't knows this. \n\nSo I don't think it can factor in here.", "Yes, I try my best. I actually went back to watch the footage because I have a camera for my cats, and I can say I am surprised I was able to keep the cool, which I always intend to, I don't like to be mean to anyone, not even when they're mean to me. \n\nOthers also agree I was calm after I showed them the footage.", "Thanks a lot :')", "And you would be correct, this is a constant behaviour she does since I'm like 13, she likes to put me down in public yet also says she loves me and that I am the best daughter when someone asks her about me and raves about how much she loves me and how accomplished I am on social media. \n\nMy therapist says this is called love bombing (?)\n\nI was (and am) exhausted of this behaviour, I don't see the need for it. \n\nFour therapists have told her she is a narcissist but every time they do, she stops going to therapy.", "Maybe that's your mother issue, that she got stuck with him when she would have preferred to break up and find a new partner long ago.\n\nYou should tell her to not project because you're not her.", "I have lots of friends who are with the same partner they had at 20 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI have lots of friends who are NOT with the partner they had at 20 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nSo your statement of \"obviously they will break up\" is bullshit.", "Probably not a meaningful sample size, but okay, I'll bite. I don't have a college yearbook (I'm not USian). But of the friends I can think of who were in serious relationships at that age - defined as cohabiting, not just casually dating - I'd say about three quarters of them are still together.\n\nThe two cases that come to mind of people who broke up are people who were married at 20, rather than cohabiting. Which may have a bearing on things - neither couple had the time to get to know what spending their lives together felt like before jumping into marriage, and so maybe didn't make great choices.", "Good for you! \nReply to her message with one saying that she is welcome to your home *when* she apologizes with you for her behaviour. \nNTA", "Then be like your aunts and grandpa and don\u2019t allow it.

He won't dare do it to my husband (his brother), but I'm fair game.  I finally told my husband I'm done.  And he supports me. \n\nI hope your BF supports you.  Then do whatever makes you both happy about your mom.  I know sometimes it's easiest to let things slide, but I'd hold out at least for a while.

This changes things completely. Granted, I didn't think you were TA for it anyway, but things seemed a bit suspect, and this explains why.\n\nEmbarrassed or not, it was obvious your mother had strong reasons to dislike your bf but it seemed like it was stuff that he might have said...but it's because she's a racist. Put that in the OP, please, so people can actually make an informed decision.", "But that is SUPER relevant information. Racism is a giant factor here. \n\nI just thought she was a typical over judgmental mother, but no. She\u2019s a racist over judgmental mother. That is even worse.", "OK, that's not even the stuff I was talking about...but the idea that she doesn't know because you didn't tell her is...unlikely. Not only has she just been around you longer, which makes her **way** better at reading you than you think, but the idea that your aunts wouldn't have told her things you told them just because they said they wouldn't is naive. There's a good chance they told her everything you told them.\n\nBeyond that, I was talking more about the sex life issues, his seeming inability to want to progress financially/careerwise, and your uncertainty in what to do in your life and how it would affect your relationship. You may think those aren't related, but the reality is your mom is probably hypersensitive to your emotional state (definitely more than she probably should be) and even if she doesn't know where it's coming from she can probably detect changes. She puts that together with some things she's heard or seen between the two of you and forms an opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I may, it seems like he's done something to you but you felt like it wasn't completely his fault and that maybe you could make things better if you improved certain parts of yourself...but you don't want to push **him** at all because you're worried he won't want to be with you if you do. I could be wrong about all of it, but I just get that from a few comments here, and she's looking at your emotions.", "Nice!  Remaining calm can really be hard to do, but now you also should have no regrets.\n\nDo not apologize, you did nothing wrong.  \n\nNTA.", "...do your guests know that you're recording everything?", "According to your OP, your mom had you when she was 17?

I could never do it for myself like op has, but I certainly did when I realized I was creating an example for my daughter.
