Its not as though you didn't know given you'd already changed your intinery once for your  own purposes so why not just tell him you weren't cancelling and for him to buy his own ticket.  He sounds like a bit of an idiot only announcing his \"surprise\" after he knew you had both bought tickets and you sound daft for not just telling him they were booked and you didn't see the need to cancel, again.", "NTA, and, if it were me, I'd have gone on to Dublin without him.", "INFO - Did he know you had made plans for Dublin when he made that decision?", "NTA.

Consider this a $350 grow a spine fee.  Stop catering to someone so inconsiderate.  If it was truly necessary for you to change you should have told him ahead of time that it would be $350.

On the other hand, if the brother-in-law is choosing to attend the event on his own volition, it may be more appropriate for him to cover his own travel expenses.
