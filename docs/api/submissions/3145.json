You clearly don't value your wife's career as being as difficult as yours. You don't value her as a person as you think the chores should be on her. One of the reasons she's likely not recovering well from the flu is because you haven't stepped in as a partner to lighten her load around the house. Of course she's unhappy. When you decided to marry and have several children, you committed yourself to being a partner and taking care of the children, but you aren't doing that.

One of the biggest sore spots is that my wife does not seem to understand that this shower is non-negotiable and, ever since our first was born she has been getting upset on and off about it. \n\nEven after almost 14 years she still has not grasped that I will always need to shower. She complains that she has to \u201cwait\u201d over an hour after I get home for me to be \u201cany use\u201d. I\u2019m not sure what she feels I should be doing instead since it\u2019s not like she needs my help with dinner - and I usually just eat whatever I want to after the kids are in bed so it is not like they are waiting on me. \n\nIt all came to a big blow up last evening because the house was a mess and she claimed that if I would stop taking my \u201chour break\u201d I could pull my weight. Thing is, that after a long day of physical work, the last thing I want to do is spend the rest of my waking hours doing chores. She teaches at the high school so it is not as demanding. \n\nThe issue is that she usually gets caught up on the weekends but because she\u2019s spent the last few weekends laying in bed (\u201crecovering\u201d \nfrom a flu - she was fine but said she was tired by weekends) now the house is a disaster and somehow it\u2019s all my fault because I have to use the bathroom and take a shower?\n\nTLDR: aita for cleaning myself up after work?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I found the wife\u2019s posting and while it is a plausible story, I am wondering if there\u2019s a possibility of trolling. \n\nGiven the wife\u2019s issues, if these stories are true, I can empathize. I\u2019m a full time breadwinner for the family and mom of two while also fighting with an autoimmune issue. I don\u2019t have any time to myself really at all until I\u2019m going to sleep and even then I don\u2019t have that luxury. If I am not working it\u2019s doing chores or doing stuff with/for the kids. My workouts that I need to feel somewhat normal are often interrupted, I get the cat or kid at the door when I\u2019m in the bathroom. Even when hubby is fully available to help a kid with something, I still end up with the request while I\u2019m indisposed. My job might not be physically taxing but the mental and emotional aspects of it do drain me and I already have the fatigue from the autimmune so there\u2019s only so much that keeps me going at the end of the day\u2026 but it has to be done. So OP\u2019s post frustrates me to no end.", "Holy shit that comment about letting her go to a therapist!!!", "Yeah, I was thinking N TAH until he spouted that crap that her job isn't as demanding.

I would take manual labor over being responsible for a classroom of high-schoolers any day of the week.\n\nOP, how is it taking you an hour to shower and get dressed when you get home?

So one day I recorded a day in my work life & showed him that evening & he was shocked at how hectic & loud a school day is. That was 10 years ago & he's never mentioned it again.

I've taught HS, and I did both skilled & unskilled manual labor while working my way through college. All of it has been demanding. Showering as a teacher took about 15 minutes, tops. Showering after working manual labor often took significantly longer.\n\nIt's not just dust & dirt you're covered in. As a commercial painter, I would come home after spraying varnish all day and needed more than an hour to get clean. Getting oil paint or stain off typically won't take as long, but that's only because you often haven't spent eight hours working in a cloud of it. You'll still spend at least 40-50 minutes getting it off & washing off all the paint thinner. Even working with latex paint, which is water-soluble, would require 20-30 minutes to shower because it doesn't simply rinse off, especially when it's in your hair.\n\nThat's just what I dealt with. Mechanics, welders, plumbers, and many more laborers have their own challenges getting clean. None of it excuses what OP does. His wife isn't a domestic servant, and she has demands on her time that he is either minimizing or outright dismissing. He's lazy. (It's counterintuitive, but it's true of lots of laborers.) She's forced to pick up his slack. I shudder to think of the filth he would live in if he weren't married. Mainly because I've seen how unmarried laborers live.\n\nAs for the suggestion that anyone who needs so long to get clean after work (especially after working with chemicals) must surely have an on-site shower, that would certainly be good. Sometimes, it happens as it should. Unfortunately, with the shrinking power of labor unions in many states and the diminished capacity of OSHA to enforce worker-safety laws effectively, that's most often not the case.", "i take a long time to shower when i wash my hair and everything. it takes me 20 minutes max. when i dont wash my hair, it takes 5 minutes to go from dirty to clean and in clean clothes. even if he was washing his hair everyday, he probably uses 10 in 1 shampoo and shower gel and conditioner and everything, so tf is he doing", "He's  hiding from his family and any responsibility to care for his kids, that's what he's doing fit all that time!

YTA, and not just for putting all household responsibilities on your wife and not helping, but also for having what looks like little to no relationship with your kids, since you state you don\u2019t even eat dinner with them and it doesn\u2019t look like hanging out with the kids or helping them with homework has crossed your mind once. Belittling your wife for being exhausted after working full-time shortly after recovering from the flu doesn\u2019t look good on you either.", "Wow YTA \n\nJust because she always does the night routine and dinner does not mean she HAS to. \n\nYou are 100% the reason why so many woman feel that men (yes they generalize because of people like you) are incapable of cleaning and helping around the house. \n\nYou feel entitled to your hour? What do you do in the shower? You could take a 5min shower and then help your wife. You gave four children, when does she get her hour while you are making dinner and cleaning and all the things?

You are not the AH for wanting to shower right after work. If you work a job that is physically demanding and you get sweaty and stuff that's normal to want to shower. I think what she is actually upset about is that you don't do anything after said shower. And dude idc how hard your job is those are BOTH of your kids and BOTH of you work and live in that house. You think bc she has a less physically demanding job that it's suddenly okay that you get the whole evening and weekend off and she has to do everything with the kids and house when she is OFF work. When does she get an evening to relax? You literally seem to be complaining that she just rested the weekend she was sick. Let me tell you that it is very demanding being a parent and keeping a house in order. And working on top of that can be exhausting. \n\nSo you really need to consider how much time she gets to relax versus how much time you get to relax.  Cause it sounds like it's mostly you relaxing and her being busy.
