{"id": 6949, "submission_id": "107yfjr", "title": "AITA For giving my daughter a list of stipulations and not allowing her to move back in unless she agrees to follow them?", "selftext": "My husband \u201cLuke\u201d and I\u2019s eldest child \u201cBetty\u201d (25F) moved out last year. When Betty lived with us, there were many tantrums thrown about the house rules. Things like why she couldn\u2019t have wild parties at the house, why did she have to load the dishwasher without being paid, or why we bought our son a laptop that he needed for school but wouldn\u2019t give her money to go to Coachella.\n\nLuke and I explained to Betty that she is not owed \u201cfun money\u201d from us. We will not pay her for doing chores because she will have to do chores regardless of whose house she lives in. She is an adult and once she moves out and pays for her own things (housing, utilities, car insurance, gas, groceries, etc.) then she can do whatever she wants.\n\nSince moving out, Betty has frequently asked us for money because she either cannot afford to do something fun with her friends or she doesn\u2019t have time to because of work. Luke and I always refuse because vacations and nights-out aren\u2019t a need and being an adult means you don\u2019t get to hang out with your friends or go do expensive things all the time.\n\nWe went out to lunch with Betty last week and she asked to live with us again. Luke and I said that as long as she honored the following stipulations, we were more than happy to let her return home:\n\n1. Pay rent every month ($500 that covers groceries and utilities as well) or be in school\n2. If she chooses to be in school, we will pay for her schooling and any tutors, but she must take her education seriously and earn passing grades\n3. Do fair share of chores (Load and unload the dishwasher, clean the pool, wipe the kitchen counter and stove, and help put away groceries)\n4. No wild parties at the house\n5. No illegal drugs\n6. No smoking of any kind. If she wants to smoke, do it somewhere else\n\nBetty said she refused to agree to these rules. So we told her okay. That is her choice to make and it is also our choice to not allow her to move back in. Betty tried to start an argument but Luke and I weren\u2019t playing along. We told Betty that she is 25 and it\u2019s time for her to grow up. She needs to accept now that this is reality and get used to handling her own adult things.\n\nMy in-laws and a friend of Betty\u2019s has reached out to tell Luke and I that we are assholes. They said they couldn\u2019t believe we were charging Betty rent, let alone asking her to do chores on top of it because she\u2019s our child and don\u2019t we love her? Betty is our child and we love her. Nothing will change that. At the same time, Betty is a grown adult. People aren\u2019t going to fund and enable her to just have fun all the time, even and especially not us. Luke and I don\u2019t understand how multiple people think this is selfish or unreasonable. So I\u2019m looking for neutral perspectives on here.\n\nTo answer the question of why Betty has this mentality that Luke and I should enable her to have fun all day, Betty's biological father has unfortunately caused her to develop this attitude. He insists that my husband and I should pay for Betty to have fun all day and handle her responsibilities yet isn't willing to actually do it himself.", "created_utc": 1673319052, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107yfjr/aita_for_giving_my_daughter_a_list_of/", "score": 3457, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As you said, she\u2019s an adult. It\u2019s your house, your rules. She doesn\u2019t have to move back in", "NTA\n\nThese are all entirely reasonable stipulations for an adult child living at home. My 20 year old contributes to the rent and bills. Adults pay rent. That's how it is.", " NTA\u2026 it\u2019s fine to help your kids- but she\u2019s 25.\n\nThe rules arnt even ridiculous- but even if they were she\u2019s now CHOOSING to move back home, she can chose to follow the rules too", "NTA. I commend you for putting down your foot, please do not bend. She is 25 years old, it really is past the time to grow up. My parents started charging me $500 rent at 18 and I didn't wanna go back to school immediately. I had already had a job for 2 years prior, and when I didn't wanna agree with their rules anymore, I moved into a place that charged $500 and lived by my own. She can do the same.\n\nThe parties and nights out can wait, and oh they will come, but for now it's time to start workin' girl. \n\nAnd if she were to move back in and adhere to your rules, it sounds like a pretty good way to shape up for living on her own one day, *responsibly*.", "NTA\n\nComing from someone who lived at my parents house in my 20s, the rules seem reasonable.\n\nSomething my parents did was to take rent from me\u2026 but once I moved out, all that money was set aside and given back. Got me into the habit of setting that money aside and budgeting. It was nice to have a nest egg / safety net when I did venture out on my own. \n\nIf she was able to live on her own and wants to move back for low funds, 500 is super generous. I\u2019m guessing that apartments are at least double or not triple that\u2026 though I don\u2019t know the going rate where you are. \n\nLast thing I\u2019ll say is that it\u2019s funny that people are reaching out to criticize, but not stepping up to say she can move in with them with no strings attached.", "Not the asshole. She's an adult, she can act like one. She's lucky you're willing to let her move back in. Your rules are nothing out of the ordinary and sounds quite reasonable, rules I myself would put into place for my own kids. Not the asshole, not even a little bit.", "NTA, so much NTA. I mean, geez -shame on you for expecting your adult daughter to act like an adult? \nTell anyone who criticises that they are free to house her for free, clean up after her, and fund her partying.", "Simply NTA, as an adult she should understand that those are the things adults sacrifice... I wish my parents did this to my sister better than enabling her and letting her think things are supposed to be handed to her. Furthermore, asking her to pay rent is fair being as though she is well over the age to be living at home in my opinion.", "NTA obviously your rules are basically \"Contribute to the household and don't bother us/your siblings with parties, drugs, or smoking\" although I mean, you raised her so I guess I'm curious how she was raised to think the world was so wonderful and whimsical that nothing cost money and she could party until the sun came up with zero consequences.", "NTA \n\nEverything you listed was reasonable. Tell everyone who is giving you a hard time over being good parents that they can open their homes to her & she can live with them without any of the things they find bad. \n\nI guarantee that they'll say no with at least one excuse or do it, but complain later when it goes badly. \n\nEither way, stick with your stipulations. It's beyond time for her to grow up & be an adult. If she doesn't like your deal then she can figure something else out that she likes better. You're being good parents even if she & the enablers don't see it.", "NTA!!!! I\u2019m 25 and live with my parents, these rules are completely reasonable. I don\u2019t get charged rent bc I\u2019m a full-time grad student and I am paying for my own tuition with 3 part time jobs. I do household chores and try to help out when I can. I never get any money from my parents for \u201cgoing out,\u201d but they obviously feed me at home and when we go out to eat as a family they pay. I\u2019d never throw a wild house party in secret, because I\u2019m not 16. If I\u2019m having friends over I let my parents know, but they\u2019re pretty lax about that lol. My dad smokes weed in the house so I get to, too, but that\u2019s pretty much it. You are making very normal & tbh mild requests.", "NTA, those are perfectly reasonable requests.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't say she couldn't move back in. She asked, and you have her the conditions. She doesn't have to accept them if they're \"too much\" for her", "NTA. You are setting reasonable and appropriate boundaries. Bending will demolish the lesson she needs to learn. Sometimes, people can't see how setting boundaries is the most compassionate thing you can do for someone you love.", "NTA. Who are these adults coming at you? Smh.", "NTA\n\nYou do not need to put up with 25 year old entitled teenager.  She can go live with the friend or in-laws if they wants.\nOr she can grow up.", "Nta at all.  And your still her parents.  You still have to teach her to be a roommate or partner and that includes all of those rules.  \nGreat job mom!", "NTA. The people coddling her can take her in!", "NAT Your answer to in-laws/friend is, \"Yes, we love her so much we're treating her like the 25 year old adult she is.\" \n\nAs far as \"wild parties,\" I'd just say \"no parties.\" \n\nYou two are handling the situation really well, keeping emotions/arguments out of the situation. If she moved into her own apartment, she'd have to follow rules about smoking and parties, while paying much more than $500 for rent, groceries, utilities. \n\nIf she doesn't want to sign the agreement, she can figure out something else - and you don't have to worry about enforcing the rules, which you shouldn't need to do with a 25 year old.", "Definitely NTA. You sound like fantastic parents and are doing your child a great service, even if they don't realise this yet. She's an adult. All of your rules are very fair and I'll be having very similar rules for my children when they're of age.\n\nDon't let anyone suggest your the asshole. At absolute worst, this child be called tough love, but I think it's just good parenting. Good on you.", "NTA she is too old for this behavior.", "NTA!!\n\nKudos to you for establishing rules.  \n\nHow did your daughter get so spoiled and entitled to begin with? Why does she think that her attitude is okay and that she is in charge of dictating to YOU how she will behave in YOUR HOME? (parties etc?)\n\nI don't know why there are so many adult children in that age range that think and feel that everyone owes them everything.  She is sadly out of touch with reality and will never survive on her own if you were to continue to enable her if you let her life with you without paying rent, doing chores and having rules.  Whomever is telling you that you are AH are also not in touch with the realities of life.  Maybe your FIL & MIL are worried that she will ask to live with them and they KNOW they don't want that! lol.   $500 is NOT too much to ask for if she is not going to school AND still needs to do chores.  IF she were out on her own she'd be paying a LOT more than that, plus groceries, bills, etc - so don't let other folks try to guilt you in to taking her back into your home without her agreeing to the rules IN WRITING and signing it. Good Luck!", "NTA And even if she agreed to your terms once she is in your home she will completely disregard them. And then you'll be stuck with all the drama of getting her to leave.  It's a lot easier to let someone in your home than it is to get them to leave.", "If more parents treated their kids like this, there would be less enabled assholes in the world. \n\nNTA", "NTA , she is a grown ass adult. The rest of the world won\u2019t allow a 25 yr old to act like a 12yr old, neither should family.", "NTA.  I think your entire post said it best with all of the details.  Bottom line, she's an adult and she needs to start acting like one.  \n\nWhat I don't get is why she is even this way to begin with.  Based on your OP, I would think that you and the hubby would have raised her to be more responsible based on the way you seem to approach this whole situation.  I'm not being critical and some wild horses can't be corralled but I am surprised.", "NTA. \n\nI can't decide what irks me more - the entitlement from your daughter or the overstepping of your in-laws. \n\nFirst, as you noted, Betty *is an adult*. I am curious which of the parameters you laid out she has an issue with - since most of them are expectations she'd face in a normal lease. I think your stipulations are extremely reasonable (provided the rent you mentioned is reasonable for the COL in the area). \n\nSecond, it could be worth encouraging Betty to see a counsellor or therapist - since it does sound like she could use a bit more direction thinking about her future. Having the support of a professional (and neutral party) might help. \n\nLastly, it is your house! The idea that you somehow don't love your child because you expect them to be an independent and contributing member of society is just silly. Plus, it is absolutely none of their business anyhow. A suitable response might be to ask them if their love would extend to having Betty live with them instead (with all the freedoms and financial support she's asking for).", "NTA. But you know she won't follow the rules even if she comes around and says she agrees. You can't win here.", "NTA. Your terms are generous. Free schooling, groceries, utilities, and only having to do easy chores (5-20min to do) are a blessing.", "NTA. She sounds like a bum...no offense.  At 25 she should not be asking her perents for money so she can \"go out and have fun.\"\n\nWhen I graduated college (2008), I immediately landed a job in my home town. I had no savings, so out of convenience, I moved back home for a year. \n\nI set the stipulations. We were roommates, I would pay for my rent. We also agreed that rent would cover food because my mom liked to cook and I liked to eat her cooking. I would help out around the house, mostly repairs. I could come and go as I pleased. Basically we got to enjoy our old life, but with boundaries. Funnily enough, I showed up with a motorcycle one day. She hated it, but I'm my own person. \n\nIn 1 year, I found a house and qualified for an FHA Loan.  Granted I lucked out to buy my first home in 2009 during the housing crash. I acknowledge that things are RIDICULOUSLY expensive and many Millennials and Zoomers are having a tough time being independent. \n\nI have no problem with the idea of young adults moving back home in this economy, but boundaries. You should respect each other as adults. She shouldn't be hitting you up for club money or trying to have parties at your house. She should be pulling her weight and paying rent.", "NTA. Your rules seem reasonable.", "NTA\n\nThe rules are simple, straightforward and reasonable.", "NTA - This is the guide for success. Life means learning to adult, she can learn it on her own if she doesn't want to abide by your rules. Anyone who says otherwise can let her move in with them.", "NTA.\n\nI was living with my mum for several years with 50/50 bills and chores. I still managed to work full time and save for fun stuff. That was in my early 20s. I'm now almost 31, and being 100% responsible for bills, housework, and a 5 year old gave me a foundation to build on.", "Info: How was this spoiled, entitled attitude cultivated? Was she enabled in her younger years? By whom?\n\nThere may be some blame here for you, but I can't know that. If you allowed this young woman to become the brat she is now it might be best to come at this from a supportive angle. You must not give in to her now but it might be wise to acknowledge that mistakes were made. Truthfully I feel like maybe your in-laws were the enablers? Just a vibe I'm getting.\n\nRegardless NTA. She needs to learn responsibility before it's too late.", "NTA \n\nYour job as parents is to make sure your offspring can live independently. \n\nShe is in her mid twenties!!! Are your in-laws delusional!?", "NTA.  \n\nDon't let her back in. She probably will never follow the rules and if you let her back home...you will find it hard to get her to leave.", "I was home from college one time, I think I was 20. I put the dishes away and cleaned up after dinner then asked if I could have a 20 to go to the movies with friends. I got laughed at and told that I\u2019m not getting paid for something that is expected out of me.  42 year old me with teens agrees with them 100%. \n\nNTA. This girl must be incredibly spoiled.", "NTA", "NTA, but also; you raised her. How did she wind up such a spoiled brat?", "NTA and if your inlaws and her friend are so invested, they can take in her entitled ass.  She's looking for a free ride on your dime.", "NTA   She needs to take care of herself and that means if she want's the party life she is going to have to figure out how to earn the money to do so.  Funny how bio dad doesn't mind spending YOUR money to provide the lifestyle he is encouraging her to have.  As for other peoples opinions,  they are just that, including mine lol", "NTA, sounds reasonable. You are kind of an AH for using \u201cl\u2019s\u201d. Why do I keep seeing this?  How can anyone type that and think it looks correct?", "NTA. You are being reasonable. Why can't her biological father take her in?", "NTA at all.

If others feel you are so cruel why don\u2019t they take her in?  What if you both are in an accident and pass away.  Will they offer her free housing, food, and money to have fun?  What would she do? She is an adult and part of the freedom that comes with being an adult is the responsibility and consequences associated with it.  You are 100% doing the right thing; teaching her how to be a responsible adult because NOBODY else will.", "NTA. Daddy\u2019s wants her to have a fun life daddy can fund it.

You aren\u2019t going to do her any favours treating a 25 year old like a child.  She sounds like she NEEDS these rules to grow up a bit", "NTA, you and your husband are doing the right thing by no longer enabling her. If all of those people want her to live rent free somewhere, not do chores, and get to have whatever fun she wants, they can open up a room to her.\n\nDon't give her any money, don't move her in with you.

My Mom had some similar rules when I moved back in with her. If I wasn't in school (paid for by me), then I had to work & pay rent.

I would not have even thought about letting her move back in. Do not let her move back in. You will just enable her poor life choices. She is 25 and needs to figure it out.", "NTA. Those rules are very fair.", "NTA. If the in-laws are so concerned, they can take her in.", "NTA", "NTA. You and Luke are spot on. If these other people want to let her move in and sponge off them, they are free to do so. They\u2019ll find out soon enough that it\u2019s a mistake. I don\u2019t see anyone stepping up to the plate to do that, do you?", "This is a rough one. Here\u2019s my take on it. First, I\u2019m going with NTA. Your rules all seem fairly reasonable to me (except smoking, because if she\u2019s addicted to nicotine then it\u2019s not as easy as you think to give it up, so I think you could be a little lenient and let her smoke as long as it\u2019s outside. \n\nBut I do think that the world has changed and parents tend not to understand that. When I was growing up (I was like 19) my parents made an unreasonable rule. They tried to set a curfew on me. I\u2019m like, I\u2019m an adult! They were like, \u201cour house, our rules.\u201d So I did what seemed reasonable at the time and I moved out. It was like $400 per month for rent at the time which was only double what I was paying for car insurance. And it was something like a $99 deposit.\n\nWow have times changed. Rent is outrageous. And you have to fork over first months, last months, and one month of security deposit. So it\u2019s like $6000 down just to move out, with outrageous rent every month after that. So \u201cour house, our rules\u201d often becomes a way of denying an adult autonomy as a kind of power play that the young adult has no real power to escape.", "NTA. Your refusal to enable your daughter is admirable. She will never cope in the real world if she can\u2019t understand boundaries and compromises and consequences.", "She should move in with your in-laws and let them support her. NTA.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. She\u2019s literally 25 and arguing about doing chores and partying. She wants to be treated like an adult while simultaneously acting like a ten year old. You and your husband are right in sticking to your rules. She\u2019s an adult, she needs to act like one.", "NTA and I honestly would not let her move back in.  If she has $500 a month for rent help her find a studio apartment or roommate situation. I'd rather financially help than let her move in. She won't respect your rules and you know it. Life will be hell and kicking her out will be a huge hassle.  I see your future clearly...lol", "NTA.\n\nShe is \\*25\\*. If she was 17, then there is an obligation still there.   \nThis is an entire adult.   \nShe can get over it, honestly. Any housemates she had would likely ask her the same.", "NTA. Crap, at 25 we had newborn twins, a 2 year marriage, a house, a very tight yet controllable, cash flow and a fucking clue. \n\nNo parties, though.", "So where is bio dad in providing for his princess?", "Nta", "NTA if she doesn't like them she can get her own place", "Nta my 22 and 19yo follow these things without even having to say them aloud", "My parents had the same rules are I thought they were 100% fair", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We're going to let BLANK know that she can start living with you for free and that you guys will allow all the things we won't. She doesn't have to pay for rent or bills. She can trash your house, and you will clean up after her, and she can have all the wild parties she wants to throw, because you won't mind. We can come over frequently and see how, with your guidance, she can be so much more successful than we ever imagined. We really appreciate you helping us to realize what we've been doing wrong.

This included room, utilities, food, etc.  My first job paid $600 a month after taxes so I got to spend $300 on fun stuff. \n\nWhen I turned 28, I told my parents I wanted to buy a place.

Not only for the house, but learning to spend below my means."]}
