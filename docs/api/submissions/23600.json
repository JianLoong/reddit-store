When I was just a 9-year-old and my sis (Jane) was 16, she got this African Grey parrot, Pepper, using her job money. She totally LOVED this bird. One day, she made me swear that if anything ever happened to her, I'd look after Pepper. Me, being a goofy kid, I was like, \"Sure, why not?\"  \nFast forward 20 yrs later, Jane is totally fine but she's got this killer job offer overseas. She has to move into company housing where pets aren't allowed. Now she's saying I have to stick to my \"promise\" and take care of Pepper.  \nBut, here's the deal, I'm in no shape to care for a bird. I've got a small apartment with no outdoor space, I'm super busy with my job. Plus, Pepper isn't the easiest bird - he really only likes Jane and can get all cranky without her. To top it off, these birds can live for like 60 years - Pepper's only halfway there. And, if you didn't know, these things are LOUD.  \nDespite this, Jane's all like \"you promised!\" and even brought our parents into it. They think I should somehow work it out because Jane's got this big opportunity and, in their words, \"Your word is your bond.\"  \nI feel like I'm losing my mind here. I was 9! Yeah, I did make that promise, but come on. I had no clue what I was saying yes to. Now, my family's acting like I'm some kind of villain.  \nSo, Reddit, hit me with it.

Now, she's moving overseas and can't take Pepper with her. I'm declining to take Pepper in because I feel like my lifestyle and living situation isn't suitable for a pet, especially a parrot with specific needs. But by doing this, I'm technically breaking a promise I made to my sister, and I'm leaving her in a difficult situation because she needs to find a new home for Pepper. She's upset and feels betrayed, and it's causing a lot of tension in the family. Given that I did promise to care for Pepper, I'm wondering if I might be the AH for breaking that promise now.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

One is a tragedy, the other a choice.  \n\nLay this out for your family.", "NTA of course.

You are not bound by any agreements you made before you were legally of age.", "Definitely NTA!\n\n1. Minors can not consent for exactly this reason, they don't understand the consequences. There is no way at 9 years old that you would be allowed to make any other 60 year commitment. \n2. Your sister is moving not dying so I still don't see how the original promise even applies. \n3.
