When I was just a 9-year-old and my sis (Jane) was 16, she got this African Grey parrot, Pepper, using her job money. She totally LOVED this bird. One day, she made me swear that if anything ever happened to her, I'd look after Pepper. Me, being a goofy kid, I was like, \"Sure, why not?\"  \nFast forward 20 yrs later, Jane is totally fine but she's got this killer job offer overseas. She has to move into company housing where pets aren't allowed. Now she's saying I have to stick to my \"promise\" and take care of Pepper.  \nBut, here's the deal, I'm in no shape to care for a bird. I've got a small apartment with no outdoor space, I'm super busy with my job. Plus, Pepper isn't the easiest bird - he really only likes Jane and can get all cranky without her. To top it off, these birds can live for like 60 years - Pepper's only halfway there. And, if you didn't know, these things are LOUD.  \nDespite this, Jane's all like \"you promised!\" and even brought our parents into it. They think I should somehow work it out because Jane's got this big opportunity and, in their words, \"Your word is your bond.\"  \nI feel like I'm losing my mind here. I was 9! Yeah, I did make that promise, but come on. I had no clue what I was saying yes to. Now, my family's acting like I'm some kind of villain.  \nSo, Reddit, hit me with it.

Now, she's moving overseas and can't take Pepper with her. I'm declining to take Pepper in because I feel like my lifestyle and living situation isn't suitable for a pet, especially a parrot with specific needs. But by doing this, I'm technically breaking a promise I made to my sister, and I'm leaving her in a difficult situation because she needs to find a new home for Pepper. She's upset and feels betrayed, and it's causing a lot of tension in the family. Given that I did promise to care for Pepper, I'm wondering if I might be the AH for breaking that promise now.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even beyond the fact that you were a minor, there's a big dang difference between \"if something happened to me\" and \"if I don't want this bird anymore\".", "NTA. Sure you agreed as a child, but you couldn't not make an informed long term decision like that at that age, and therefore were impossible of consenting. \n\nFrankly I would never leave an extremely valuable pet with someone who didn't want to watch it/consent to it out of care for my pet.", "One of the best things I learned from Judge Judy is that **minors cannot enter into binding contracts**.", "I highly doubt that Jane HAS to live in company sponsored housing. Just because it's made available to her, why would she have to live there unless she's in the military or something. \n\nNeither does she HAVE to take this job. But if she wants to, she needs to do the hard work of finding a very good home for her bird.", "NTA, it sounds like your parents are \"volunteering\" to adopt Pepper given how easy they think it would he for you.", "You cannot make a legally binding contract with a minor.\n\nThis is a good example of why such laws are in place.\n\nYou are NTA OP.", "Trying to hold someone to a promise they made at 9 yrs old is stupid. What kid understands the commitment, time, space, and needs of a large parrot? Nta... Your sister needs to be realistic and figure something out for her parrot.", "Nta it's illegal to make a contract with a minor and she is basically using the promise as a contract.", "NTA. Tell your parents, \"Didn't I also say I was going to marry dad? So, are mom and dad getting divorced, and we're going to find a country that allows that?\" \"Did I ask to poop poop in my diaper, so now I need to always do that?\"", "The sister is TA - she made a commitment to the parrot, who is easily as intelligent as a human toddler. If you get a grey, be prepared to give up that job opportunity if there's no way to transport him/her. You can't just pawn off a big bird like that on someone else.", "Let the parents take the bird.", "The sister adopted a long-lived pet, just like/even more than a kid she needs to provide continuity for her loved one. She is a sh\\*\\*ty person. The parents are sh\\*\\*ty people too.", "Absolutely NTA. OMG are parrots hard to care for! My family has fostered or owned over 30 parrots over the years- no thank you! They\u2019re loud, they\u2019re expensive, they have strict dietary needs, and they can bite and cause damage. I would check with your lease- in all likelihood they won\u2019t allow an African grey parrot on property, which gets you out of this situation easily. They can damage property if they get out of their cage, and that\u2019s obviously a big no-no when renting. And the complaints from neighbors due to the noise\u2026 none of this works even if you wanted to take him. \n\nYour parents can take him. Or your sister can reach out to various rescues to see if her paying them a monthly fee will allow them to care for him until she comes home. But you are in no position as a renter to take him.\n\nEdit: this would be a different conversation if she had, say, a parrotlet\u2026 a small, non-destructive and quiet parrot is one thing\u2026 but that is the opposite of an African Grey\u2026", "Agreed! And the parents should be the ones taking care of the parrot if they support the sister leaving. OP is NTA.", "This is exactly correct. This is your parents fault.", "tbh her parents have jumped on her too is because THEYRE on the chopping block next \ud83d\udc80", "I could not agree more, but man, I hate the word \"rehome\". It's most often used by people like OP's sister, who are irresponsible with their pets and want a less guilt-inducing term than the alternatives.", "This isn't the kind of family that understands reason. The parents expect him to honor an agreement made at 9 years old!", "Poor Pepper indeed - many species of birds mate for life, and solitary ones kept as pets will \"mate\" with their owner. OP already says Pepper gets upset when Jane isn't around. Pepper will get sad and pine for Jane (no Monty Python jokes please) and may even die. The poor bird doesn't understand divorce, which is essentially what this is :-(", "LAME answer, sister would be one excuse after another. Wait till she wants a family.....", "Question: is the company housing her long-term housing, or is it only temporary housing for 30 to 60 days? I work in relocation and many corporations have temp housing in place for their employees to reside in until they find something permanent or long-term. \n\nIf it's temporary housing, mom and dad can birdsit until sis gets her first home leave (which most companies budget for as well). Then she can take Pepper back with her, if the host country will allow the bird in.\n\nETA: NTA, OP ws 9 years old. OP wasn't old enough to sell their soul to the devil much less agree to take possession of the bird.", "Sister could find a new temporary home for pepper where she is moving if she was motivated enough. Pay them to pet sit Pepper, get to visit her, and then hopefully move to non-corporate housing asap to take care of her commitment.", "That's how it worked when the company my partner worked for relocated us. 30 days in corporate housing until we could find a place of our own. It sucked to have to essentially move twice in such a short time range but it beat the hell out of having to scramble to find a place in a new and unfamiliar location. \n\nAs far as birds go, its pretty typical for a lot of bird species when kept as a pet to only really bond with one person. So its not that Pepper is a particularly difficult bird, its just being a bird. And its one of those things that a lot of people either don't know or don't take into consideration when they get birds. OP is NTA, birds are not the sort of pet you can just rehome with someone who doesn't know how to take care of them. If the bird has a vet they see regularly (which I really hope they do) they may be able to help with some resources of people/organizations look after Pepper who know what they are doing to keep Pepper safe, well, and happy", "\"Haven't seen little Timmy around in a while.\"\n\n\"Yeah, his parrot died, so we had to kill him.\"", "No, they're afraid that the sis will withhold kids when she has them."]}
