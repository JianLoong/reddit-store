They're not expensive but very personal and usually hand crafted.\n\nFor his 30th birthday earlier this year I made a 365 day tear of calendar with for each day a funny line or joke from a youtube series we both enjoy (and often joke about among ourselves). A lot of time and effort went into it, I spend 3 nights gathering all the lines, went to the printshop to get it printed and handcrafted a backboard to strap all the individual pages onto.\n\nLeading up to my birthday he hinted a few times about the \"awesome\" gift he got for my birthday. So I was really excited and looking forward to the time I would visit him again (we live about 1,5 hours away from each other) and receive my gift.\n\nSo the gift turned out to be an official meme t-shirt from a Formula 1 team. We both enjoy Formula 1, but this wasn't from one of the teams we support. And the meme on the shirt isn't something we joke about too often.\n\nIn all honestly I was a bit disappointed since I put a lot of time and effort into my gift and received something that was just the click of a button and didn't feel very personal.\n\nWhat makes it a bit more disappointing on my end is that a few months ago we both spent a lot of time on a gift for another friend where a lot of jokes and inspiration came from his side. This 3rd friend is someone we used to be very close with but over the years got more and more out of touch. So to think that we spent a lot of time on his gift makes it a bit more painful.\n\nI'm really torn about this, since I really appreciate the fact that he got me a gift. But I can't help to be a little disappointed about the difference in effort that seemingly went into the gift.\n\n**So reddit help me out WIBTA if I spoke out to my friend about the fact that I'm a little disappointed?**\n\nI really have the feeling this looks really bad from the outside. To give some more personal insights: I'm slightly struggling with mental health issues lately. Mainly about the fact of feeling appreciated and seeing returns on something I invest in. So I do have the feeling it is very much related to that. But I also feel like speaking out when I experience these feelings will help me.

I understand that you are struggling with your mental health but just because you gave your friend a gift that took three days doesn\u2019t mean they have to do the same in return.

I guess I'm to pre occupied by peoples perception of myself that I expect them to return that effort equally.", "I didn't mention it yet. That's why I'm asking here.\n\nThanks for your honest opinion.\n\nAs mentioned in my post I'm struggling with some mental issues. I guess challenging those feelings of disappointment and speaking out about it could be a result of that. But I think you're right, speaking out about it won't help anything but possibly hurting our relationship."]}
