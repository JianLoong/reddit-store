That sounds to me like she just guessed based on her appearance. Hell, she may even have thought she looked older given her face was blown up like Culkin at the end of My Girl and inadvertently landed on the actual age. \n\nIt wasn't apparent (though, it could be the case) that the OP knew her real age. If she did then, yeah, it's probably a little mean, but even then I'd argue that feeding someone's bullshit, especially someone you aren't necessarily close to in any way shape, or form, is completely unnecessary. \n\nThere is far too much weight put on others to, at the very least, tolerate people's ridiculously misguided images of themselves.

She could of just said I don't like guessing people's ages and left it at that. \n\nIf I was in this situation I would of just said something like that to not be catty but also not give the annoying botox lady the validation she wants. There's more tactful ways to go about this without making the night out even more awkward."]}
