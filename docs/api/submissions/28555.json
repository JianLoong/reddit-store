He needs a certain amount of sleep to stay healthy. You don't have the same issue. He really has to suck it up and deal.\n\nHowever, could you compromise/help him not be so upset about his disability? Could you stay up late with him and then tell him to sleep in, as long as he needs, and you'll get up and deal with the child care?

When I was 7, I was diagnosed with a progressive and terminal disease. 2019, I took a bad turn and was very close to death.

But after my almost dying episode, I needed more sleep as I recovered. I got hurt and upset because my husband wouldn't come to bed until hours later. I was hurt because I missed him, I was upset at my own disabilities and feeling very low about them, I felt like I wasn't getting time to do things either with him, or just do the hobbies and passions I have because my waking hours were filled with dealing with life. By the time I got done dealing with life, I was too exhausted to do anything else. \n\nI seethe for a while. I got snippy and told him he needs to come to bed earlier and all sorts of things like that. It started a few arguments. He didn't understand where it was coming from. All he saw was me trying to dictate when he had to go to bed. It wasn't until we sat down and actually had an open and honest conversation that he understood. When that happened, we were able to work something out so that I wasn't facing the feelings I was having, even if they didn't all make sense. Talk to your husband.

Because it's one thing to be aware of a problem, but it's another thing to make your life revolve around your problem. You SHOULD be awake during the day more, because you're the SAHP and your kid is going to need to get to the point where they have structure and a schedule. You don't get to sleep all day anymore.

I work nights, and I would never wish having to be on a night shift schedule to anyone. \n\nPut your 2 year old to bed by 8 and plan to be awake by 7am. It doesn't sound like you even try to provide a normal schedule to your poor child because you'd rather stay up late.", "You seriously sound like two people who should not have had a kid. Poor kid. ESH.", "Your TWO year old sleeps for 12ish hours? Without getting up? Without crying about their diaper? Without being HUNGRY? Without wetting the bed of they aren\u2019t in diapers? I\u2019m genuinely so confused. Does your child have some sort of medical issue or something? \n\nYou need to be instilling a better schedule for your child. Sure pre-school and kindergarten probably seem real far away but the reality is it\u2019s not. Does your toddler take naps still? Do you in any way maintain a normal schedule for them? You are showing him it\u2019s okay to be sleeping in late as you can because BOTH of you do it. Children mimic behaviours fast. Why don\u2019t either of you wake up to wake your kid up at an hour that is suitable for their age? \n\nYou both sound so immature. Guess what sleep when you have children sucks and it sucks for a long time. As someone who became an older sister as a teenager I am floored that you have a child that can stay up that late AND sleep in that late without needing anything from you. Both my little sisters I was lucky if they woke up 1-2 times. Two year olds are like the hardest time.", "Info: what will you do when the kid needs to get up at 6-7am to go to school? What will you do if your kid finally switches to the normal hours on non-school days? At some point, you will need to start looking after your kid from 7-8am until 9- 10p\n\nJust make sure to use protection so you don't add another child to your situation", "Sorry to be harsh, but it sounds like you two need the education by doctors and teachers not your very young child. Kids learn from what they see, and the picture you have painted here is not a good one!! ESH", "You don't need a Dr, jfc, if you wake the kid up at 7am like a normal person you'll all be ready for sleep earlier too.           \nIt's laziness causing this, a Dr can't help you with that.          \nDevil's advocate though, I'd love to hear what the Dr thinks about it all. What did you tell them and what did they say?", "This reply just made you even more YTA in my book. \n\nYou have had sleep problems YOUR ENTIRE LIFE - and you are setting your own child up to go through the same thing.\n\nThe issue is not your husband's childish jealousy (though that is also a problem). The issue is that you and your husband are not helping your child develop healthy sleeping habits.\n\nYour kid should be getting up a lot closer to the time they will need to get up in the morning when they start school. \n\nI'm glad that you are seeing a sleep specialist, and I acknowledge that it's a process. But you shouldn't focus your husband's pettiness, but on how you can both work to create healthy sleep patterns for your child. That should be the top priority for both of you (and that would also include both of you getting enough sleep).", "Hmmm I wonder where the child gets those sleeping habits from?", "At 2 years old your kids needs to work on sleep with doctors and teachers because his parents failed him.", "I had the same thought - this poor kiddo when they go to school. Oof. This is seriously messed up. Yes, when you\u2019re an adult and a parent, you have to stop having the sleep pattern of a mid-summer teenager.", "My 3yr old just started preschool. She\u2019d always been an early riser, but finally started sleeping past 8am the last nine months or so. Preschool is at 9. Getting her to wake up early again has been a nightmare, and it\u2019s only an hour difference. I can\u2019t imagine a whole half a day.", "Its pure laziness.", "You know both parents are staying up late playing video games. They should not have kids", "Is that so weird? My 3 year old sleeps from 8pm to 7am almost every night and has been doing that for quite a while, my oldest did as well when he was that age. I'd say them going to bed at midnight is a bigger issue than sleeping for 12 hours.", "It\u2019s perfectly normal for 2 year olds to sleep 10-12 hours at night without waking, depending on their nap schedule. Most toddlers need between 11-14 hours of sleep each day. By 2 years old, a child no longer needs an overnight feed and is not wetting enough in their sleep to require a diaper change before being awake for the day. Some kids still wake through the night, as it sounds like your sisters did, and that\u2019s totally fine and normal too.\n\nSo I agree with the rest of your comment, but the sleep *length* thing is just incorrect.", "It\u2019s normal for a 2 year old to sleep 12 hours. My son has been sleeping 12 hrs since about 5 months\u2026we didn\u2019t do any sleep training or anything but definitely practiced healthy sleep hygiene. He goes to be at 7 and wakes at 7.", "A two year absolutely does not sleep for 12 hours straight every night without interruption. If they actually go to bed at midnight and do not get up to check on the kid until noon, that is neglect and very likely abuse", "\ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf"]}
