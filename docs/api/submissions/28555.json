He needs a certain amount of sleep to stay healthy. You don't have the same issue. He really has to suck it up and deal.\n\nHowever, could you compromise/help him not be so upset about his disability? Could you stay up late with him and then tell him to sleep in, as long as he needs, and you'll get up and deal with the child care?

When I was 7, I was diagnosed with a progressive and terminal disease. 2019, I took a bad turn and was very close to death. I spent 2.5 weeks in the hospital (most of it in a higher level of icu, I pretty much had a nurse all to myself). My recovery took much longer than that. My husband and I have always been night owls. But after my almost dying episode, I needed more sleep as I recovered. I got hurt and upset because my husband wouldn't come to bed until hours later. I was hurt because I missed him, I was upset at my own disabilities and feeling very low about them, I felt like I wasn't getting time to do things either with him, or just do the hobbies and passions I have because my waking hours were filled with dealing with life. By the time I got done dealing with life, I was too exhausted to do anything else. \n\nI seethe for a while. I got snippy and told him he needs to come to bed earlier and all sorts of things like that. It started a few arguments. He didn't understand where it was coming from. All he saw was me trying to dictate when he had to go to bed. It wasn't until we sat down and actually had an open and honest conversation that he understood. When that happened, we were able to work something out so that I wasn't facing the feelings I was having, even if they didn't all make sense. Talk to your husband.

Because it's one thing to be aware of a problem, but it's another thing to make your life revolve around your problem. You SHOULD be awake during the day more, because you're the SAHP and your kid is going to need to get to the point where they have structure and a schedule. You don't get to sleep all day anymore.

Easier on both kid and parents. But there are those of us, like myself, who thrive on a schedule where I go to bed at 4 or 5 am and get up at 2 in the afternoon. It's my body's natural rhythm. And fighting that as a teenage resulted in many years of getting approximately 2 hours of sleep, even if I was in bed for 12. A good night would be three hours, and on very, very rare occasions I'd get 4. Maybe twice a month? I was constantly exhausted. It contributed heavily to the depression I was already dealing with at that age. I talked to doctors, did what they said. Completely cut out caffeine and most sugar, exercised but not too late in the day, etc, etc. I tried music, white noise (at the time that was a radio set to no station), silence, complete blackness, some light, etc. I had a bedtime routine. Tried going to bed at the same time every night and getting up at the same time every day, no matter how much (or little) sleep I got. Nothing worked and the professionals had no idea.\n\nI would end up so completely exhausted that once every three or so months my body would shut down and I would sleep for 24-30 hours straight as it tried to catch up. The next night it was back to almost no sleep. Even if I set an alarm at got up after eight hours on the nights I crashed, I still couldn't sleep the next night. The only thing that helped me sleep better was when I had kids. I was so completely exhausted all the time that I could actually sleep 5 or 6 hours at a stretch. \n\nOnce my kids got older and I wasn't so tired all the time, my body went back to refusing to sleep. It wasn't until I allowed myself to shift my sleep schedule that I began sleeping more. I still get up with my teens and make sure they get to school on time, but most days I end up having to have a nap because I couldn't fall asleep before 2-4 am.

Shift work it out(mom stays up to get kid to sleep/does night time wake ups and dad sleeps which means dad gets up early with kid and mom sleeps in or something). Something.
