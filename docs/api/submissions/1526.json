She always had a passion for food and I was always good with numbers, so we combined our skills and opened up a restaurant together. She was so excited about following her dream and being able to provide for her kids with it. Five years later she became unwell and died weeks after learning she had cancer. My sister and I talked about the business extensively. Before she died she signed ownership over to me. She had me promise that if her kids wanted in they would take over her share in the future, which I agreed to do. At the time we had discussed her husband and his place in it all. She had said she did not want him to control her share after her death because she did not want his future wife and future children to potentially inherit from her. That she wanted it to be her gift to her children if they wanted it. Not something that went to his new family once she was gone.\n\nBoth kids became interested and have taken over their share. They will also take over mine some day as my children are not interested.\n\nMy sister's husband did remarry and he did have more children, as well as a stepchild. Bad blood started to form after he remarried. His wife didn't like that her husband had no idea what the business was worth and didn't like that he wasn't responsible for my sister's half, that would eventually be my niece and nephew's share. She told me she felt it was their job as the parents to have a say over what happened to it. I told her no way. He offered to buy me out of the restaurant and I turned him down. He told me he didn't like knowing it would exclude most of his family if his kids wanted their share. I told him it would potentially include all of my sister's children though.\n\nWhen the kids took over their half they chose not to give access to their stepfamily. They warned me that their half sister was already asking to be included. She's the oldest. She's 16. She had asked me before if she could be a manager and wanted to share her siblings portion of the business. The kids' dad approached me recently and told me he wants me to allow her to work here and join the family business alongside his kids. He said my niece and nephew would benefit from forming a closer relationship with their half siblings and that it would mean so much to their half sister to be welcomed in and made part of everything. I told him that was not happening. He grew frustrated and then accused me of being a monster and of interfering in his life after remarrying. He told me I was doing nothing but encouraging othering in his family. That it was unfair to punish him for moving on. I told him I was not punishing him. That his adult children had refused and that was what he should focus on. But he needed to understand that his minor children are not my family and therefor are not entitled to have anything passed down from me. He left after accusing me of acting like I hate his kids.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667636230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymo06t/aita_for_refusing_to_allow_my_niece_and_nephews/", "score": 199, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are following your late sister's wishes. Nothing more. You don't owe him anything. Seems like him and his new wife are trying to get involved for the money. Not the love of the business", "NTA, you were essentially the executor of your sister's wishes and now the other children are adults and if he has an issue, he needs to take it up with them. Your half is your half.  \n\n\nalso on a tangential note who asks to start out as a manager at 16? work your way up, sheesh.", "NTA You have kept your promise to your sister when many would have given in to your former BIL 's  relentless manipulation. She was right to entrust her share to you since her husband and his new wife would have surely tried to insert themselves in the business and divided her half of the business among all the children.", "NTA and your sister knew what was going to happen, is actually happening. She hoped you were strong enough to withstand the barrage of hate that would eventually come from her husband\u2019s new wife and children. \n\nThen thing about cancer is, it steals from generations of families. If your sister hadn\u2019t died, (I\u2019m very sorry) she wouldn\u2019t have split her restaurant with her \u201cex\u201d husband\u2019s new children, as the only way the new kids would have born would have been for your sister to get a divorce, and then he gets remarried and has kids. Of course dying is different, but the facts are the new kids, aren\u2019t your family or your sisters family. They are strangers.\n\nBecause your sister willed YOU her shares of the company with the sole reason of you being the protector, that means you stand at the gate, repelling all attempts of interference by whomever believes they deserve anything. They don\u2019t. \n\nAnd in the book of rules of life playbook, if they want to be involved in a family business, they need to start one.", "Oh, def NTA. You've discussed this situation with your lawyer, amirite? Please, please tell me Yes.", "NTA You are respecting your sister's wishes by not including his other children in her share. Beyond that you (and your sister's kids) are allowed to run your business however you see fit. He is indeed acting entitled.", "NTA. His wife and him and their children have no say in how you run your business. They\u2019re just entitled.", "NTA. This was your sisters dying wish which you\u2019re upholding. It was her gift to her children and you saw that through.", "NTA. Your sister's wishes were clear and you have respected them. His new wife is grasping and selfish. If he chose to marry again and to have children that's up to him but it's nothing to do with the business you started with your sister. This isn't about them wanting their family members to be closer - it's all about the cash value of the business.", "NTA - it\u2019s literally non of his business! He should just be happy his older children have a share in a business at all. It\u2019s not for you to provide for his new family. Tell him it\u2019s never gonna happen, that\u2019s your final answer, and if he keeps bringing it up you will cut him off completely. His wife must be delusional if she thinks thats ok", "Nta astonishing how well your sister predicted her husband action", "NTA. Your sister knew exactly what she was doing when she put in place protections for her kids against a potential greedy gold digging second wife which unfortunately came true. In a perfect world she wouldn\u2019t have had to but reality is different. Their half siblings have NO right to any portion of you niece and nephews portion of the business and they have made it clear that they don\u2019t want their greedy stepmother, father, steps or half siblings anywhere near it. You can bet the 16 year old had been put up to being pushy by her witch of a mother and father. None of them are entitled to anything that belonged to your dearly departed sister rest her soul and the fact that the stepmother thinks that she is shows you what a nasty witch she is. Good on you for protecting your sisters kids and their inheritance from these greedy weasels.", "NTA, and your former BIL should be grateful, you could have been an arsehole and decided to keep everything. You proved your sister was right to trust you, not only did you give your Niece and nephew their right but you even plan on giving them your part. \n\nHe needs to butt out, he didn't put work into the business and doesn't get a say.", "NTA you are following your sister's wishes to the letter.\n\nYou would be the AH if you caved as you would be diluting your niece and nephew's share in the business and disrespecting what your sister asked you to do. \n\nYour BIL's new family have no stake in that business. No shares, nothing. That's how your sister wanted it.\n\nNot sure if this was ever in writing? Would be good to supply your BIL with a copy.\n\nAlso, there was a very similar post to this a few months back. Restaurant, demanding new wife, daughter wanting to manage the kitchen and everything.", "NTA in the least, this is incredibly disrespectful of the kids' dad and his new family and a massive overstep. But they will never stop. And they will probably escalate. You and the kids need to think hard and plan together how much you're willing to tolerate from them and when, where, and how a hard line will need to be drawn.", "NTA in any way. You are simply respecting your sister's last wish, and taking care of her children's wellbeing.\nOnly the respect for you for standing up to such an entitled mischief of petty rats!", "NTA. Definitely consult an attorney, just to cover your ass.", "I read the title thinking op you asshole...then I read the text. NTA.", "NTA You do excactly as your sister wished.

Definitely NTA", "NTA your sister knew what she had to do", "I don't even think it's the money exactly. I'm sure that helps.

But human beings are highly talented in figuring out ways to make life unpleasant for others. Consider the idea of shelling out a little cash and a little time just to cover your bases.

NTA.", "Lmaooooo, not the 16 yo girl wanting to be a manager, you let her in your business is RUINED.", "NTA - The entitlement here is astounding.", "NTA, but you should probably have it set in stone as much as possible legally, because if they are so insistent about it I'm fairly sure that they either have or will look into getting their hands on the business this way once they realize that it might be an option.", "NTA. Your sister discussed the relevant issues with you and made her wishes clear. Her wishes were reasonable and you have carried them through.\n\nYour half of the business is yours; in line with your sister's wishes her half of the business belongs to your nephew and niece (if I have understood correctly). As the business owners, it's your choice who else gets to buy in, and who to employ.\n\nThese are things that are difficult within blended families, but I don't think it's fair to automatically expect that the expectations of some of the children will automatically be extended to all half-siblings, stepsiblings etc. Your husband presumably loved your sister, and he should respect that it was her choice to make the provision that she wanted for her children. How he provides for an enlarged family when he remarries are his business to work out.", "Nta. Please tell your BIL that this has nothing to do with him.

Not everyone have those.", "It only bothers her cause there's money to be made out of it, your sister unfortunately had a very clear view of what kinda of person she was married to in her last days.", "What your sister did was smart. This is what I encourage people to do. Too many people take what was left from their spouses and hand it over to people other than their kids. I'm glad you are on your niece/nephew's side here. It's your family business not his family business. NTA.", "Wait, the 16 yo meant NOW? I thought they meant after they\u2019d finished high school and/or college they\u2019d become a manager. Them thinking they\u2019re qualified to be a manager at 16 is laughable.", "That wasn\u2019t a serious suggestion and wanting to be made manager? Even if he did hire her to bus tables, I doubt she\u2019d stick to it. People that entitled rarely like actually working hard for a pittance. Anyway, depending on where they are he can probably just fire her when she tries to use the fact she\u2019s the owners\u2019 sister to not have to work and threaten other people\u2019s jobs."]}
