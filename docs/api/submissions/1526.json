My sister and I talked about the business extensively. Before she died she signed ownership over to me.

She had said she did not want him to control her share after her death because she did not want his future wife and future children to potentially inherit from her.

They warned me that their half sister was already asking to be included. She's the oldest. She's 16. She had asked me before if she could be a manager and wanted to share her siblings portion of the business. The kids' dad approached me recently and told me he wants me to allow her to work here and join the family business alongside his kids. He said my niece and nephew would benefit from forming a closer relationship with their half siblings and that it would mean so much to their half sister to be welcomed in and made part of everything. I told him that was not happening. He grew frustrated and then accused me of being a monster and of interfering in his life after remarrying. He told me I was doing nothing but encouraging othering in his family. That it was unfair to punish him for moving on. I told him I was not punishing him.

Your sister's reasoning was sound. This is an inheritance, not a \"family business\". As her husband did not inherit it, he therefore has nothing to give his other children. Also, nothing makes a business unprofitable more than having too many owners with whom to split the profits (not to mention the pain of everyone being decision makers).

You would know better than me, and I'm just guessing here, but it's a restaurant. That means unless the business owns the building it operates out of, it's probably capital poor.  It probably earns decent revenue, and turns a profit most years, but at the end of the day, owning the business is little more than a regular job, one that pays slightly better on average, but with a lot more downside risk.  I'm guessing the last couple years were fun.\n\nBut the new wife doesn't know any of this.  She just sees that there's a \"business\" and of course all business owners are greedy multimillionaires and that even a small piece of that pie would be a huge financial benefit for her and other members of her new family who are currently being excluded.  \n\nAs far as it goes, you can probably include the half sister if you want.  She wants to be \"part of the business\" she can be a near minimum wage employee just like everyone else who works there who's not related to you.  And no, she won't be starting as a manager.

Both of his children \\[my uncle and my mom\\] were allowed to work in it. My uncle chose not to, but my mother did. Eventually, I was born and now I'm an owner of my familys' business.\n\nAbout seven years ago, my nana \\[grandmother\\] had made some noise about inheriting papa's portion and draining it / giving it to my uncle. My uncle is the golden child for my nana, and she gives him everything. My mom and papa immediately worked with an attorney to ensure that, in the event of his passing, my nana would not be able to touch the business at all.\n\nIn 2019 my papa died due to cancer - it was very quick, though not nearly as quick as your sisters' \\[for which I'm sorry you had to experience\\]. As planned, my papa's shares in the company were distributed to the remaining owners \\[me, mom, and my sister\\]. Nothing went to my nana or uncle.\n\nHowever, as a gesture of goodwill / familial responsibility / whatever, we give my nana a stipend of about $2,000/mo from the business since she no longer has my papa's paycheck coming in. We aren't required to do this by any means, but my mom, sister, and I agree it's the right thing to do. She actually gets more than I do currently, because we've had to cut our payroll due to many factors - but we didn't cut her pay.\n\nMy nana still grumbles about not getting the business. She says that since papa left the business to mom, my uncle will get everything else \\[house, vehicles, etc.\\] - which is her right, since it's her stuff, but she doesn't really get that papa didn't 'leave' us the business. We earned it by working long days and nights to keep it going, and by doing whatever was best for it. She also calls and complains often that we don't give her enough money, since now my cousins, my uncle, and my uncles new wife live with her and all of her bills have gone up.\n\nWe have done everything right - and then some - by my nana. We gave her money, we take her to the company dinners, we do anything and everything papa would have done for her - and more, because my papa, for all that I love him, was a very selfish person in many regards. It still isn't enough for her, because she didn't get the business to do whatever she wanted with.\n\nYou can't win. They'll always take and take and take. Your best bet is to do what you know your sister wanted and ignore that small voice in your head saying 'I should do X because it would be a nice thing' - because once you've opened that door, they're gonna keep pushing for more and more.
