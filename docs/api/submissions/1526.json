You would know better than me, and I'm just guessing here, but it's a restaurant. That means unless the business owns the building it operates out of, it's probably capital poor.  It probably earns decent revenue, and turns a profit most years, but at the end of the day, owning the business is little more than a regular job, one that pays slightly better on average, but with a lot more downside risk.  I'm guessing the last couple years were fun.\n\nBut the new wife doesn't know any of this.

This guy is no longer your family and it sounds like he was never your friend.  The business only has 100%. You can't give away more than that - so you'd be giving him your share.  And he doesn't even work there.  Restaurants are only floated by the current work-efforts.  They can evaporate very quickly - and he's not contributing.\n\nFuck that guy.  Cut ties.  If he seems vindictive then put up some cameras.", "NTA in the least. And it\u2019s a ridiculous that a 16 yr old step-niece thinks she should be a MANAGER and part owner. Like, I could MAYBE understand making her a hostess and eventually a waitress. But wanting to jump straight to manager and especially expecting to gain any sort of ownership is absolutely off the wall.\n\nGood on OP for honoring their sister\u2019s last wishes.", "NTA and your sister called it. Good thing she had the forethought to sign things over to you to protect you and her kids from their dad and his new family.", "NTA. And your sister knew this would happen - I am glad she prepared for it. Your niece and nephew said what they wanted - the end.", "NTA\n\nYour business has nothing to do with him or his new family. Why is he asking/insisting on these things? Sounds like someone wants a free ride.", "NTA.  Just wondering if you would let the 16 yr old work there but NOT receive any ownership of the business.", "Understood what your sister\u2019s wishes were, but circumstances change.  You never indicate anywhere whether the step-sister is responsible, hard working or otherwise.   If she would make a good addition, it may make sense to let her try to prove herself.  If she is demanding inclusion simply because she\u2019s family, then that\u2019s another matter.  Nothing says you have to make her an owner.", "100% NTA, this business was started by you and your sister and she signed her portion over to you to hand down to her two children if they wanted it. She expressed that she didn\u2019t want it to go to her husband or his future wife and kids and you should tell him and his wife and kids that. Also your niece and nephew should step up and tell their father, half siblings and step mother that they are honoring their mother\u2019s wishes. They need to go start their own business and stop trying to take what they didn\u2019t work for from your dead sister. After that they aren\u2019t to bring it up anymore and not come by the restaurant.", "The truth is that your ex-BIL never had any interest in the business until his new wife came along. Your sister had the foresight to plan for this very occasion. You are following her wishes which have been reinforced by his own kids. NTA.", "NTA. His kids with the new wife aren\u2019t entitled to shit and you\u2019re honoring your sister\u2019s wishes. Your sister knew exactly the type of man she married and made plans accordingly.", "NTA your sister really knew her husband.  You are doing the right thing.", "All I can say is your sister knew her husband very well!\n\nNTA", "NTA your sister knew this would happen and put You in charge for a reason. \n\nStand your ground and protect your sisters legacy and Her children\u2019s inheritance.", "NTA\n\nEven ignoring all the family stuff, the kids' half sister is 16 years old and has the audacity to ask for a MANAGER role? What a laugh.", "NTA and it looks like your sister knew how shady her husband was in the end \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA they're only interested in the business because it's successful.\n\nYou don't owe your ex BIL, his wife, or their kids anything.\n\nYou could let the 16 year old work their but they may try and spin that into you giving her your share, which wouldn't be the case. Better to just steer clear of that bunch.", "Exactly! And, even if the sister hadn't explicitly stated her wishes/intentions for the share she signed ober to OP, there would still be no reason for OP to include any of the BILs new family members.", "I remember reading something similar but from the daughters perspective, I\u2019ve been looking for the link.  Happy I\u2019m not the only one who had this thought.", "https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uv6akp/aita_for_saying_my_half_sister_cant_work_for_my/", "I think what the other commenter said - about covering your bases just in case - is a good thing to do. These days, businesses get wrongly accused in social media all the time so who\u2019s to say that the disgruntled half of your BIL\u2019s family won\u2019t start slagging the business off because if they can\u2019t participle, nobody can. \n\nAnyway - I will never understand why people want IN on something that was never theirs nor not connected to them in any way. I mean\u2026 are you THAT insecure? Are you THAT jealous that your half-sibling has something you don\u2019t have? Or is it from the fact that these people cannot fathom that their husband/parent had a life before them and therefore, anything and everything from that previous life either must be discarded or assimilated, no other option.", "Well then tell them to start a business for their kids.", "Her kids have a living mother.  \nAnd they can't even let the others have a restaurant.  \nLow people in that family, I wouldn't share a business with them either.", "I absolutely agree OP is NTA, and BIL is acting like an AH (probably driven by new wife) in this situation.  Sister made her wishes clear and OP is right to follow them, and it wasn\u2019t wrong in the least to want to provide for her children\u2019s future.\n\nBut I do have some sympathy for a surviving spouse who has more children - to BIL, they are all his kids.  Where he crosses into AH territory is in not accepting no and recognizing the legal difference.\n\nIf the half-sister is a problem, obviously not - but if she is a kid with a real interest in the restaurant business maybe offer her employment (on their standard terms) with no ownership interest?", "Gosh a couple decades ago I remember a restaurant in my city that didn't own the building asking for like $900,000. I laughed. It didn't really have any lasting brand value. Some recipes, equipment, and tables and chairs. It shut down without being resold.", "Agreed she was so wise!", "I found this one from back in March: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uv6akp/aita\\_for\\_saying\\_my\\_half\\_sister\\_cant\\_work\\_for\\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uv6akp/aita_for_saying_my_half_sister_cant_work_for_my/)\n\ntl;dr OP and his two older brothers are refusing to let their half-sister and stepmom work in the restaurant owned by his mom's side of the family and dad is upset.", "I do as well but I believe it was the late wife\u2019s parents who had the business.", "I recall this too.", "I remember it too, but the niece wrote in not the aunt.  The father and his new family are really determined.  \n\nI do not know if a cease and desist letter from an attorney would help.", "Well, it is a family business, just not his family business.", "Thank you.  I honestly cannot believe there are two situations like this.  People are so entitled.", "You are correct.  It was the daughter from the first wife writing in.  I posted above it was the niece but I remembered it incorrectly.  Thanks.  So unusual about the 16 half sister in both cases though.", "Seems very similar at any rate."]}
