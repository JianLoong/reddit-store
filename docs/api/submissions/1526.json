My sister and I talked about the business extensively. Before she died she signed ownership over to me. She had me promise that if her kids wanted in they would take over her share in the future, which I agreed to do. At the time we had discussed her husband and his place in it all. She had said she did not want him to control her share after her death because she did not want his future wife and future children to potentially inherit from her. That she wanted it to be her gift to her children if they wanted it. Not something that went to his new family once she was gone.\n\nBoth kids became interested and have taken over their share. They will also take over mine some day as my children are not interested.\n\nMy sister's husband did remarry and he did have more children, as well as a stepchild. Bad blood started to form after he remarried. His wife didn't like that her husband had no idea what the business was worth and didn't like that he wasn't responsible for my sister's half, that would eventually be my niece and nephew's share.

I told him it would potentially include all of my sister's children though.\n\nWhen the kids took over their half they chose not to give access to their stepfamily. They warned me that their half sister was already asking to be included. She's the oldest. She's 16. She had asked me before if she could be a manager and wanted to share her siblings portion of the business. The kids' dad approached me recently and told me he wants me to allow her to work here and join the family business alongside his kids. He said my niece and nephew would benefit from forming a closer relationship with their half siblings and that it would mean so much to their half sister to be welcomed in and made part of everything. I told him that was not happening. He grew frustrated and then accused me of being a monster and of interfering in his life after remarrying. He told me I was doing nothing but encouraging othering in his family. That it was unfair to punish him for moving on. I told him I was not punishing him. That his adult children had refused and that was what he should focus on.

Your sister discussed the relevant issues with you and made her wishes clear. Her wishes were reasonable and you have carried them through.\n\nYour half of the business is yours; in line with your sister's wishes her half of the business belongs to your nephew and niece (if I have understood correctly).

Ownership between the partners was signed over long before the second wife came along.  You became a 100% sole proprietor.

A letter is not by itself enforceable, but if they continue harassing you over this you need to establish you have asked them to stop.", "nta, what an entitled a s s.", "NTA. Your sister's reasoning was sound. This is an inheritance, not a \"family business\". As her husband did not inherit it, he therefore has nothing to give his other children. Also, nothing makes a business unprofitable more than having too many owners with whom to split the profits (not to mention the pain of everyone being decision makers). If your sister's children became, say, software engineers, would they be expected to share their salaries with their half-siblings? This is the exact same thing.", "NTA\n\nIf the 16-year-old had been working there as staff and had a passion for the business, I could see *maybe* considering it. She is 16 and asked to be a manager. That's just entitlement.", "NTA. Amazing that they feel entitled to a business that has nothing to do with their family. Stick to your guns. You do not owe them anything. Tell them to give your kids a share in their house.", "NTA!!!! Your sister's decision makes perfect sense to anyone who isn't trying to profit from her.

They are not entitled to anything. Save any voicemails, texts, letters, camera footage if they show up, and speak to an attorney. This is going to get uglier.\n\nEdit- Make sure you and your sisters kids plan ahead. You all need an attorney to write out a will with what you  want to happen incase something to you/them. This will\nmake it harder for them to contest it.", "I'm also guessing some of the people involved have an overexaggerated idea of what the business is actually worth.  You would know better than me, and I'm just guessing here, but it's a restaurant. That means unless the business owns the building it operates out of, it's probably capital poor.  It probably earns decent revenue, and turns a profit most years, but at the end of the day, owning the business is little more than a regular job, one that pays slightly better on average, but with a lot more downside risk.  I'm guessing the last couple years were fun.\n\nBut the new wife doesn't know any of this.  She just sees that there's a \"business\" and of course all business owners are greedy multimillionaires and that even a small piece of that pie would be a huge financial benefit for her and other members of her new family who are currently being excluded.  \n\nAs far as it goes, you can probably include the half sister if you want.  She wants to be \"part of the business\" she can be a near minimum wage employee just like everyone else who works there who's not related to you.  And no, she won't be starting as a manager.  She'll be bussing tables, taking out the trash, and cleaning toilets just like any other entry level new-hire at 16.  My guess is that even if she goes for it, it won't last a week before she loses interest.", "It just shows your sister knew exactly the type of man her husband is that she ensured her children were protected long after she was gone.

Of course she should be the manager of the restaurant regardless of her age! /s\n\nYea a 16yo manager, that's a good way to lose employees, their respect and most likely the business too.\n\nThank God OPs late sister had to foresight to realise what would happen when her husband remarried and took steps to prevent it."]}
