Either she is fibbing, or the landlord fibbed to her.\nA lot of places are 'zoned' for either commercial or residential uses, and there is a lot of paperwork and permits if you are trying to cross those things.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't buy the story of some rando offering more money for a space that wasn't even available and the landlord breaking a business lease (and risking legal action). They couldn't allow someone to continue living in a commercial space for legal reasons is my guess.\n(you see that a lot with certain social media sites, dumb people moving into their office to save rent, think their boss won't notice, and then act all shocked when they are fired and escorted off property) \n\nNot that it really matters in the situation, I just thought that one was interesting.", "NTA.

She has to be out of the place by 6 am everyday and can\u2019t return until after the workday is over and you have had a chance to decompress. So 6am-8pm she needs another place to stay.

If you had a guest room, that'd be different, but you really do not have room.\n\nAn overnight guest, even just for a night, is very cramped in a 1BR apartment.  You have to stay in your room until you hear signs of life outside the room to avoid waking someone up.  There's really not much extra space when someone is sleeping on the couch.  You have to follow their schedule since they're occupying the main room of the apartment.  So if they want to go to bed at 9, you're stuck in your room for the night.

If this was for a weekend, I'd say suck it up, but for 2 months, no thanks.\n\nMy mother came to stay with myself and my wife and it was fine as we have a 3 bedroom home and are empty nesters.

Call me cynical, but I think the business is failing, she can't pay the rent (and probably breaking the lease by living in office premises) so is being evicted.
