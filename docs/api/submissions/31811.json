I pay for my own gas and insurance so I don\u2019t usually have a lot of money left over on a month to month basis. My sister (22f) moved back in with our mother and I over the summer because her previous living arrangement was in an apartment over our uncles garage, and her long term boyfriend who we all adore had a falling out with our uncle on a fishing trip. So they both moved back into their respective parents houses. Whenever my sister moved in she had a good job at a hospital and was making decent money. But recently her and several coworkers walked out because they fired another girl twice in the same week and they didn\u2019t follow protocol. It was the final straw in a long list of problems. She had to find a new job which pays less than the previous one. She is still paying back everyone she borrowed money from when she was looking for a job, so she is also mostly broke. She specifically told me when she moved in not to touch her shampoo and conditioner. It was an expensive brand and I had no interest of using it. Recently she started using mine because she likes it more. However within the past month I\u2019ve had to by shampoo and conditioner 3 times, when I only wash my hair once or twice a week and a bottle usually lasts me a month or two. And she\u2019ll use the last of it and won\u2019t tell me so when I go to shower there is none left. She does that same with my face wash. But we share the soap, that was agreed upon and she bought the last bottle. I asked her to at least tell me when we were out but she refuses to acknowledge she\u2019s using the last of it. Would I be the asshole if I started taking my shampoo/conditioner and face wash out of the shower when I wasn\u2019t using it?", "created_utc": 1701028248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184j1v9/wibta_if_i_kept_my_shower_stuff_in_my_room/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sister is mooching off you.\n\nIn fact, I suspect that if you just put your stuff in your room she will sneak in and take it.  You need to get a locking plastic container, OP, instead of a bucket.  Amazon has a number from which to choose.\n\nBe prepared for sister to throw a hissy fit if she can no longer steal from you.\n\nNTA", "Leave the empty or soon-to-be-empty bottles in the bathroom.
