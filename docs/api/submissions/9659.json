Leave your brother alone.", "I'm a psychologist in my day job, for what it's worth. As others have said - this is a perfectly 'normal' phenomenon. It's called 'positive sexual imprinting'. \n\nLike all aspects of sexual/relationship development, it doesn't apply to everyone. However, it applies to a lot of people nevertheless, and is considered 'normal'. Just because you are different in your own attractions, doesn't mean you should consider yourself the ultimate prototype for what is 'normal'. There are actually various 'normal' pathways, that cause people to develop their attractions - meaning different people have different attractions.\n\nAnd parents usually play some role in those developments, whether positive or negative. That's because parents usually serve as the main early attachment for most people. The human brain is designed to use early attachments as a 'blueprint' for later developments (especially before age 5). That then influences most other attachments (including romantic/sexual attachments). \n\nIt certainly doesn't mean your brother has any inappropriate feelings towards your mother. All that happens with positive sexual imprinting, is a young child associates the parent with positive feelings. Something called the Westermarck Effect, prevents the child developing sexual feelings towards the parent as the child gets older. But they still use that early positive attachment as a 'model' for later attachments. They associate character traits, appearance, etc., with the early and positive love they experienced from the parent - and so they tend to associate similar people with the parent's warmth, reliability, etc.\n\nIndeed, as mentioned - most people bring their parents to their later relationships in some way (since the developing child's brain, uses this first attachment to develop a general blueprint for attachment). If it's not appearance, it might be purely character traits. Many people are attracted to people with character traits like their parents (whether positive or negative). \n\nThis is a big problem when the parent was abusive, for example (their children are often attracted to other abusive personalities). But when a parent has had a healthy enough relationship with the the child, many children tend to be attracted to healthy (and similar) personalities. And it's nothing to do with wanting to have sex with the parent. The brain guards against that, via the Westermarck Effect. \n\nIndeed, we see appearance-based imprinting in other ways, too. It's been proven that if you have a bad experience with someone (in any context), you have a higher chance of mistrusting people who look similar (and vice versa with good experiences with people). So calm down, and stop pathologising your brother's relationship. You need to do your research first, before deciding something normal is 'abnormal'.", "YOUR OPINION DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER", "Because he's a different person than you?
