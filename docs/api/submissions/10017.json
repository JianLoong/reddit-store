That is exactly the right move. If she can't handle that, you should find a different friend.", "NTA, your safety was absolutely on the line, we\u2019ve all seen enough horror stories to know how this might have ended.\n\nAdding to this, you still don\u2019t know if Danny is safe, oftentimes predators involve someone like her as an intermediary to get your guard down. \n\nUnfortunately my source is dear friends of ours whose daughter was targeted for a trafficking ring.", "NTA. That's an actual crazy thing to be mad about. It's weird that she didn't have an adult there herself too. Horrible things happen and kids get trafficked every single day. You did a smart thing and don't let them convince you that you were wrong.", "NTA, you did exactly the right thing, and if Danny can\u2019t see that, then that\u2019s her problem.", "NTA at all. You did everything right. You put your safety first. You are clearly a clever young woman, and if I were your parent, I would be proud that you handled meeting someone online correctly. You did nothing wrong.", "DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE ONLINE \u201cFRIENDS\u201d!!!\n\nYou were extremely smart to bring an adult that you trust. There are sooooo many stories of bad things happening in these situations. \n\nBetter to lose a friend than to lose your life.\n\nNTA", "Nope, NTA. You acted responsible, took measures to be safe. Something a lot of people don't do when meeting up with online friends for the first time.\n\nDid it make her upset? Yes. But does it make you an asshole if you're just wanting to be save? No.", "NTA\n\nI\u2018m sorry that she\u2018s making you feel bad for being better safe than sorry. You were sensible and please stay like that.", "NTA - you acted in your own best interest. Who knew if \u201cDanny\u201d was bait for human trafficking? Or actually a middle aged dude intent on kidnapping/rape or murder? No one should be mad at anyone for bringing security with them when meeting someone from online for the first time. The fact that she\u2019s so mad makes me suspicious honestly, about underlying intentions. Even if she wasn\u2019t bait from someone else\u2019s scheme what if she wanted you to be alone so she could hit you up for money or ask you to do something bad for her (like shoplifting or other theft). You\u2019re young enough to want to believe the good in people. I\u2019m old enough to be skeptical of people.  Tell Danny that seeing to your personal safety is a boundary you will always maintain. If she\u2019s still pissed about it - she was never your friend.", "NTA - it is wise when you meet internet people to have a safety person.  However, you might have let Danny know a bit earlier than you did.  From her perspective, she was suddenly outnumbered 2 to 1 and hadn't even realized it.  I suspect she is mad at herself for how naive she had been and is projecting that back at you.", "NTA. You were being sensible and mature, and keeping yourself safe is important. It's sad that Danny can't see that-I can sort of understand why she reacted as she did, like you didn't  trust her, and appreciate that she might have initially felt insulted, but you have the absolute right to do what you feel was necessary to feel safe enough to meet.  Maybe when she calms down she'll begin to understand. Your other online friends are TA though.", "NTA, and can I just say, your dad sounds pretty awesome.\n\nHe (and mom?) have raised you to be a smart individual, knowing the potential dangers of internet stalkers, but not making you afraid for the real connections that can be made.  He's also pretty awesome for going and sitting in the park (even if he failed as an undercover operative - no CIA work for him) and letting you spend time with your friend without being overbearing.\n\nSorry you lost your friend, but don't let that change anything you did this time.  Maybe Danny will come around, maybe not.  Sounds like she could learn from the wisdom you have gained.", "NTA. You did exactly what you needed to do to keep yourself safe. It wasn\u2019t wrong for your friend to feel weird someone was watching y\u2019all, but you explained. Especially with all of the cat fishing and trafficking nowadays, you need to follow your gut and take precautions.", "NTA. Those other kids need to learn that the internet is NOT a safe place and full of creeps. Danny could of easily lied about their age and who they are.", "NTA, NTA, NTA. You absolutely, 100% did the right thing. I would be way more than proud if my kid ever asked me to do what you asked your dad. You\u2019re being cautious and safe, especially because you had only talked over discord and not IRL. Whoever is saying differently really isn\u2019t someone you want to be around because they will not have your best interests at heart. Good for you for staying safe.", "NTA. I\u2019m an adult who runs a discord server. To give you some perspective, I would be texting my irl friends and family bare minimum before I met up with someone. Safety matters, and I\u2019m sorry your friend isn\u2019t being understanding. In fact, I\u2019m really glad you stayed safe!! I bet your dad was happy you were safe too.", "Nta Danny sounds like a bad friend for making you feel bad for doing the right thing.", "NTA. You did the best and safest thing you could do while still meeting your online friend. The way Danny and your other online friends are treating you is wrong, and quite frankly, it's a rather odd thing to be upset about.", "NTA You did the right, responsible thing to do.\n\nThe headlines are full of stories of teens who have met terrible ends because they trusted the wrong person.\n\n\rThe worrying thing is that Danny doesn't understand your point of view, because she could become the victim of some bad guy who deceives her.", "NTA, she's angry you didn't trust her implicitly without ever meeting her? That's ridiculous! It was smart of you to have a safe grown up around just in case she happened to be an unsafe grownup. Her behavior seems really suspicious to say the least!", "NTA. \n\nDanny sounds like a possible sex offender. She could be older than she stated. You are a smart young woman.", "NTA - You were smart and responsible. I'm kinda shocked her dad let her go meet up with some stranger in a town away from home by herself. That's questionable parenting.", "NTA, safety first, you did the right thing but maybe could have told them sooner instead of waiting to be asked.", "NTA a thousand times over. You were very smart in what you did, your dad was in the distance and didn\u2019t seem to bother you guys and gave you privacy. \n\nAs sad as it is, you can\u2019t be too careful these days. Just cause you talked to her in video chat and met her, doesn\u2019t automatically everything is safe. Some kidnappers use kids and teens to lure unsuspecting victims, might be rare, but still I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry.\n\nI\u2019m guessing the people who agree with Danny are also young? Don\u2019t mind them, they are talking from a lack of experience and from ignorance", "NTA. Proud of you for putting your safety first and making smart decisions. Good job.", "NTA, and good for you for bringing your dad the first time you're having an in-person meetup. I'm a little surprised Danny's father let her meet an online friend in a different city to be honest! No matter how much you trust someone, especially online, you should always care about your own safety. Adult criminals have been known to use a young person as bait to meet other young people.", "The way Danny responded makes me think Danny's not that safe to be around.", "Honestly, I can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t bring her dad. Or that her dad didn\u2019t have a problem with meeting a stranger.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your friend is shady for being mad about that. Plenty of bad people use teenagers to lure new victims. You sound like a smart person. Let this friend go.", "I know it\u2019s very hard to not feel upset at a loss of a friend. I know all the adults that are commenting ( even myself) forget what it feels like to lose a girlfriend at 14. YOU are a smart cookie for thinking ahead. But I also aren\u2019t mad at the friend, she isn\u2019t being aware of true dangers out there. Taught if you will. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis type of thing needs to be normalized.", "NTA ! not even close , This was the perfect way to go about it .", "NTA. You did very well and i\u2019m glad you trust your dad to watch over you. Keep it up!", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s never an asshole thing to want to take steps to stay safe. Who knows what could have happened if Danny had lied about herself?\n\nThere was a case where a boy met up with his online friend and ended up getting murdered by that friend. And there\u2019s probably more cases of similar traumatic endings out there, but his is the one that came to mind first. What my point is, is that being cautious is NEVER warrant being an asshole move", "NTA \n\nYou did the right thing. Keep those instincts.", "NTA, it\u2019s not like he was sitting with you. Always err on the side of caution! You made the right call and if Danny stops to think for a moment she might realize that\u2019s what clever folks do.", "10000% NTA.\nThis is the bare minimum safety precaution you could have done.\nI get why she is upset but she has to grow up. Give her sometime to cool down and then try to apologize (even though you have done nothing wrong) and tell her that you were afraid someone else could have known about your meeting place and trying to impersonate her (which is not entirely impossible).\n\nI am just wondering if your father was at an earshot and she felt that he was listening to your conversation or something like that.", "NTA. She's being ridiculous. You're being practical.

Adults have used children as lures to attract and kidnapp other children. Asking your dad to be present was a remarkably mature and adult thing to do for your saftey. As an adult, I would never meet an internet stranger alone. Always always always have a trusted friend or relative with you for saftey. I am sorry that your friend didnt understand, and seems to have ended the friendship. I remember being 14 and losing friends, it sucks! But you can and will make new ones.

I hope this experience doesn't discourage you from doing the exact same thing the next time you're thinking of meeting an online friend in person. \n\nIt's very strange that Danny took it the wrong way, and even weirder that her reaction was so visceral.

When I was in my mid-twenties, I remember I was just chilling outside, smoking. These young looking teens came up and asked me for a cigarette. I said no, sorry, I don\u2019t give smokes to kids. They started getting angry and one said what a hypocrite I was, someone bought me those cigarettes and now I won\u2019t share. I was like\u2026I bought them? And the kid asked where I got my fake, if I could hook them up. They thought I was under 18 (back then you only had to be 18 to by cigarettes). I was,like, 25.\n\nAll this to say: Ms. Danny might not really have been a 15 year old girl. She could easily have been a scrawny 20-something, getting paid to befriend young folks online. The fact that she got really angry with you for protecting yourself is weird.", "It was very smart of you to ask your dad to accompany you. Sure, Danny seemed to be who she said she was, but you had no way of knowing that before meeting.\n\nYou\u2019re all young, so I\u2019ll say Danny\u2019s odd reaction most likely comes from general immaturity rather than something nefarious. However, it may be a good idea to take a step back from the friendship for a bit.

You did the right thing, but, since it's a strange man to her, I understand she may have been nervous.\n\nYou were protected, but to her, your dad could be a threat.

Tell them they can bring someone too.", "First off, I am very proud of you for looking out for yourself and doing everything possible to make sure you were comfortable when meeting someone new. You made a smart choice that any genuine friend would've understood and moved on from.\n\nYou are not the asshole. At all. Not in any way, shape or form. \n\nIt's one thing for her to interpret it as you not trusting her, but it's a whole other thing to tell everyone in the discord group and have them gang up on you.\n\nIf there's any asshole in this situation, it's her.\n\nInstead of hearing you out or trying to see it as you just wanting to feel comfortable and safe, she decided to bombard you with a bunch of messages and send a brigade to prop herself up as the victim.\n\nThat is full on asshole behaviour.\n\nShe's showing her true colours and I'm sorry that she's throwing away what seemed to be a fantastic friendship all because your brought your dad along.\n\nAnd all he did was sit, it wasn't like he was being embarrassing and telling you guys where to go or what to do. Man was just sitting and making sure his daughter was okay.\n\nMaybe that's why she reacted that way. Her father obviously didn't care enough to be present when his 15 year old daughter was meeting an online friend. While it's possible he just trusted her judgment, knowing that your dad put in the extra effort to be present mightve triggered something for her and she took it out on you.\n\nShe mishandled it. Badly.\n\nKeep on looking out for yourself \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA Danny is no friend at all.  That she would get upset about a \"friend\" doing what they could to be safe is a red flag.

NTA.", "You're a smart young lady, you did everything right and have nothing to be worried about.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Assuming Danny isn\u2019t a decoy, she\u2019s just jealous that her own parent sent her to meet a stranger in the park alone.", "NTA. You choose safety and that is never the wrong choice. You are 14 and a girl and therefore absolutely in danger of perverts. Danny\u2019s reaction is really weird and honestly worrying.", "NAH. Ok, I get everyone saying you did the right thing and protected yourself, but try to think about it from Danny's perspective. She thought she was meeting with a friend 1-1 and then suddenly realizes there has been an older man watching her this entire time, a man she never met and you claim to be your dad but for all she knows you could be the trafficking decoy with a guy behind you scoping the scene.\n\nShe was probably freaked out of her mind and ran away as fast and safe as possible.\n\nSure it's good to have someone making sure you're safe and ok, but maybe it would be nice to inform the other parties involved. You could have introduced them so everybody feels comfortable, not doing so makes you look sketchy tbh", "NTA but maybe the friend was just as careful as you, and she does not know the guy watching is your dad. \nSo OP is scared of human trafficking, but she also might be scared of that.  Or felt weird after being observed by some older man she doesn't know. \nMaybe. \nI don't know a solution, i think OP did the right thing but i can imagine that girl being as anxious as OP is about catfishing, human trafficking etc.", "NAH. It was good to bring your dad. BUT!! I think you shouldve tell Danny beforehand. She's not much older than you, what if she freaked out that your dad is not actually your dad and that she's in danger? I'm surprised nobody mentions this. So yes, it was very good to bring your dad, it's important to be safe, but I see her point too.", "NTA \nYou are a smart young person. Your dad should be proud that you took your personal safety seriously! Kudos!!!", "Thank you for saying this. I think Danny\u2019s reaction is a huge red flag and leads me to believe this meeting was the first step in a patient game, designed to put OP\u2019s guard down.", "NTA. I'm an adult and after being friends with a woman in another state for years online when we first met we both brought people with us. Also the second time we met with our husband's. The third time, we met with our sisters. Now we've been friends for 10 years and we meet up whenever we want with or without Other people. OP did the smartest safest thing.", "To me it seems that Dani was probably a decoy.

She needs to step back from the \u201cfriendship \u201c", "I agree and disagree.  I think the dad being there covertly was smarter than letting Danny know and suddenly the plans changed and could not meet.  It also allows for a \"true\" meeting.  I am torn TBH about this comment.

Nothing wrong with bringing your father to watch, for safety reasons, but not nice that you weren't open. If you'd had nothing to feel bad about, why would your heart have dropped into your stomach when you were caught out? All you had to do was say, my Dad is over there. I came here with him. You ok with that?", "NTA. The internet is very dangerous with evil people trying to take advantage of the naivety of young girls (and other children too. Crime doesn't just happen to girls) like you. The golden rule of the internet is to never trust someone you never met so it was a rational decision to bring along your father. Sure she was really a 15 year old girl but what if it was a 40 year old p- who would had grabbed you in a dark corner and did horrible things to you? Even if you would had left there might had been someone following you to your home. You always need to keep yourself safe. You always need to prioritize yourself. Anyone from the internet who doesn't want you to feel safe isn't your friend but someone with bad intentions to break down your defense and manipulate you to do what they want and come alone.\n\nDanny's reaction is really suspicious. She is a 15 year old girl too!! Why is she mad that you wanted to protect yourself in case you got fooled? Was she a decoy? Did she asked you to go check out her hotel/house? Or drive you home? (And then driven anywhere but your home.)", "NTA... one of the most disturbing things I watched on Oprah was a girl who met another girl at school.  They became friends.  The \"friends dad\" even came to her house with the friend and met her parents.    Her parents were over protective and insisted on meeting the dad of the so called friend.  They convinced the parents to let her come with them to \"clean some apartments\".  They kidnapped her, held her hostage and trafficked her.  Her injuries were so horrific she can never have children.  Decoys are a thing.  That man was not her friends dad.\n\nDanny got weird because she was a decoy.  There is no other explanation.  Block her and have nothing to do with her.  A young girl would understand that you were trying to be safe.", "NTA. You did exactly what you should do. You\u2019re a smart girl", "NTA\n\nYou did exactly what you should have done.", "Da fck is she mad at? You were incredibly smart and safety is so important. Sweet I'm almost 30 and I take precautions. New job interview, I'll tell my partner all the details and he has the ability to track my phone in an emergency (never used it before). Any time I meet a new person I either have someone with me, meet in a very public place and give someone the details. Your very young and you just can't be to careful. She's definitely over reacting.", "NTA honestly worrying if her family is fine with her meeting a stranger from the Internet in a different state, I don't blame you one bit", "NTA", "NTA - You literally did exactly the thing that both of you should have done. If you were my daughter I'd be so proud of you for being so sensible, responsible and aware of the possible dangers of what you were doing. Your dad should count his blessings that you are clearly a switched on kid. You trust your dad to talk to him about these things, and quite honestly, you will go far in life having a mindset that thinks about possible outcomes. If you haven't already, give chess a go! Good luck on your future endeavours, and don't let your online \"friends\" tell you that you were being an AH. Tell them to ask their parents if they think you were being an AH or not. I guarantee each and every one of their parents will say you did the right thing. Any one who's parents think you are an AH, well they clearly just neglect their own children so it matters not.", "NTA: It\u2019s really suspicious that she didn\u2019t have an adult with her.\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. You did the smart thing. Seems like somethings up with Danny any chance she's older than she told you and looks young?", "NTA. You didn't know who was coming to meet you. Better to have your Dad there and be a bit embarrassed than not have him there and someone you didn't expect shows up.", "NTA  \nWhat you did was \\*smart - I really don't get why she would be upset.", "NTA. You did the smart thing!", "NTA.\nYou were 100% in the right. It's weird that your friends aren't like oh dih her dad brought her cuz she's a kid and was nice enough to keep a distance while they hung out. If I was 14 meeting someone new in public BOTH my parents would be there ... And wonderong why they can't meet the other kid's parent so they knew everyone involved. I would personally say it was weirder for her \"dad\" not to be there, with his kid, in a different city, meeting a whole other person, esp w the state of deepfakes lately. YOU could have very easily been a kidnapper setting her up to be taken, with the right internet shenanigans. \n\nStay weird, stay safe.", "NTA. As a parent, I never would have let my 14 year old go to meet someone online without being there. It was cool he gave you your space and just stayed at a far but safe distance. Heck, when I was 14 I went to warped tour with my friends\u2026.and my mom chilled at all of the stages in the back. 14 is still a child. I think it\u2019s awesomely responsible that you were the one who reached out to ask for this, but honestly your parents should have done it anyway. No reason for kid to be mad.", "NTA. You should always let your dad know and take him with you at this age. You should stop talking to this person.", "NTA. You were smart and ensured you were safe. There have been numerous instances in which adults who look like teens have enticed victims to meet them for nefarious reasons. There have been instances where traffickers have employed teens to entice victims to meet with them. It is an unfortunate part of the world we live in. If Danny doesn't understand that, then she is childish.", "NTA   You are a smart young person!", "YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! Even though she is your age, she still could be one of those kids that attract others to being trafficked. Better be safe than sorry, and if she's mad at that than she's not your friend NTA at all", "NTA. \n\nI was part of a similar online group when I was your age. I\u2019m 25 now. In hindsight, a lot of what we did then was unsafe. Luckily most people were who they said they were, but in the decade since I\u2019ve been active in that community, I\u2019ve also learned that quite a few people were *not* who they said they were. \n\nIt\u2019s much better to be safe than sorry and you did the right thing.", "NTA. You\u2019re a smart kid!", "NTA\n\nYou were being safe, you did nothing wrong. I hope it works out tho and your friend comes around. I met my online friends about your age and I still talk to them over 15 years later.", "NTA. And the way she acted is good enough reason to have your dad there.", "NTA. I suggest you find new friends. What you did was perfectly reasonable, considering you only knew her online and you are only 14.\n\nMaybe you could have told her in advance that your dad would be there at a distance but tbh the fact that she got angry is a huge red flag.\n\nMaybe she wanted you to be alone for some reason. And the whole online friend group turned against you? Very strange. My guess is that you were the target of something and they will try to encourage you to meet again but without your Dad around.", "NTA you definitely did the right thing and there are red danger flags going up everywhere! It sounds like Danny may be assisting adults in trafficking other kids. Kids tend to trust kids so this is an easy way for traffickers to steal other children. \nThey get your trust and then you suddenly disappear thinking you\u2019re going somewhere with a \u2018friend\u2019. \n\nPlease cut this friendship off 100%. Your safety likely depends on it. \nFind irl friends in your own school/town where people know the families.", "Firmly NTA. You were smart by bringing your dad. You did exactly right for the right reasons. This old person is proud of you.", "Nah that's a good move. People get legit kidnapped way more than people realize.", "NTA. You are never wrong to be safe when meeting online friends. Danny isn't a good person (imo) and shouldn't be someone you should try meeting offline or apologizing. You did the right thing for you! People get trafficked, or worse in situations like theses! Kudos to you for being a smart cookie. Reward yourself by getting a new friend group!", "NTA, she\u2019s being a drama queen, walk away. You took your dad, good decision. Anybody can pose as a 14f on the internet if they wanted , lots of people catfish.", "Nta and Danny sounds like a psycho", "NTA\n\nAnd you sound like a very smart kid...", "NTA - And your \"Friend\" acting the way she did does not say \"Friend\" to me.", "NTA\n\nI am very proud of you that you were safe and of your dad that he went along without judgement.", "Your dad is a great guy. He will always look out for you", "NTA!! Good on you for bringing a parent. Please dont let this friend influence you otherwise. Rather be safe than sorry.. Its so easy for predators to get a victim this way.", "NTA, and everyone should do this when meeting someone from the Internet. I met several online friends as a teenager, and they all turned out to be who they said, but my parents and theirs all came along, every time.", "NTA if I was your parent, I wouldn\u2019t have let you go without checking this person out. You never know, it could have been an adult with dodgy intentions", "Absolutely NTA. Your friend getting so upset that you wanted to be safe is a sign that maybe you should take a step back from this friendship. Definitely a weird reaction. Safety when meeting people for the first time, especially if you know them from the internet, should be a top priority and it\u2019s good you and your father agree.", "NTA. You did an incredibly smart thing and should be proud.", "NTA not even a little bit. The way your \"friend\" reacted is not ok. I think you have to reconsider letting this person into your life, and you may want to also discuss the situation with your parents for some clarity.", "NTA\n\nI'm impressed with your maturity and it seems you are more mature than them. You absolutely did the right thing. It doesn't matter how long you've known someone or how close you are; if you've met them online have someone with you. You can't be safe enough. My friend is almost 50 and went on a date last week with someone she met online. I made sure she sent her location and had her app on that lets us track her phone, and she had to tell us when she arrived and when she left. \n\nDon't ever feel guilty or horrible about doing something that kept you safe.", "Yeah no, definitely NTA. I'm 28 and it was drilled into me when I was your age to NEVER EVER FUCKING EVER give out personal information nor to meet a friend online without another person I knew and trusted nearby.\n\nSadly, your age group has not been taught the same because advertisers wanted to target you easier through the internet. If you need to leave the server and block people, do so. Don't be scared to stand up for yourself nor to remove people from your life who don't respect you.\n\nDanny doesn't want to talk? Good freaking riddance!!!", "NTA, you did exactly what you should have by having your dad come with. I\u2019m thinking maybe Danny is mad at you because you didn\u2019t tell her right away that he was there, though? I\u2019d be creeped out if an older man was \u201chiding\u201d watching me without being introduced. Just a thought.", "Youth councellor here, i love the relationship and trust you have with your dad. You did everything right. The biggest NTA in the world from me, and tell your dad he is awesome.", "Absolutely NTA.  You displayed good judgment and your dad should be very proud of you.", "NTA for keeping yourself safe, you made a great choice. I've heard so many horror stories about people your age ending up in dangerous situations because they met up with an internet stranger and they were alone. \n\nFrom Danny's perspective, though, she's in an unfamiliar place, meeting someone new, and there's an adult man she doesn't know who keeps watching her. I think it might have been a good idea to tell her ahead of time that your dad would be there. Anger is usually a secondary emotion, so it's possible she's mad because she was scared of someone she thought could be a danger to her, but it turned out the potential creep was actually just your dad.", "NTA at all. Danny's reaction confirms that.", "NTA and if you were my kid I\u2019d be proud of your forward thinking. If you were my kid and were meeting someone from online and I found out you were doing it alone you\u2019d be grounded for life. \n\nGood job OP", "NTA \n\nYou were smart and did the 100% correct thing. Don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you that your safety isn\u2019t important. You ( and your parents at this age) are responsible for your safety. It sounds like your dad has raised your right. Give that man and extra hug and tell him he\u2019s a good dad. You\u2019re a good daughter and a smart person. \n\nAlso, young kids have been used to lure other young kids since kidnapping was invented. Just because someone is your age doesn\u2019t mean they are safe.", "NTA. Probably one of the hardest things about being a teenager is the social encouragement amongst each other to make poor choices. It's \"not cool\" but you were very wise and honestly I'm impressed. I think if she's a real friend and thinks about it she'll come to realize you're actually pretty smart. At least until you knew who she was it made good sense to bring your father. I imagine he was proud of you for being that smart honestly. Good luck", "You know what I tell my 8 year old daughter... Always chose safety over comfort (especially someone else's)... The world is a pretty messed up place regardless of how good someone looks, feels, claims etc... There is always risk and this was a first time meeting\n\nNTA", "There's a lot of crazies out there especially on the internet.  You did the right thing in trying to keep yourself safe.  She's not really your friend if she doesn't understand this.", "don\u2019t trust her, a true friend would never go to anger over you protecting yourself. NTA and you were very smart for bringing your dad", "NTA, and good for you for being both smart and safe. You have no way of knowing if Danny was who she said she was, or someone completely different. If she has a problem with you, that's her problem, not yours. You have nothing to apologize for.", "Nta it almost sound like there was something planed but she quickly noticed you Dad was watching and decided to wait and see. When he didn't leave she pointed him out hoping that drawing attention to him would make him leave.", "NTA. Well done, you did the right thing, and I hope anyone would bring a safe person when meeting someone irl that theyve only met online.", "NTA. You are so smart to bring a trusted adult and you deserve to feel safe when you\u2019re meeting someone in person. If Danny doesn\u2019t understand that or can\u2019t cope with the fact that you deserve to feel safe, she isn\u2019t a good friend to you. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you have a good enough relationship with your Dad to trust him with this. I bet he was so glad you asked because good parents will do anything to keep their kids safe. You sound like a smart, mature teenager- keep making careful decisions like this when you meet people online and take care of yourself first.", "NTA \n\n\nI find it so suspicious that a 15 year old was allowed wander around alone in another state by her dad. Also how did she know about the park that she asked you to meet her at if she\u2019s not from there? Usually when you go to visit someone you ask them where\u2019s the best place to meet because you wouldn\u2019t know the area. \n\n\nIf she asks to meet you again without your dad then please don\u2019t do it.", "NTA. Really proud of you OP for approaching things this way. I\u2019ve seen kids in their late teens not considering their safety and meeting strangers alone. You\u2019re a smart girl.", "NTA,", "NTA and even though I don\u2019t know you, as the mom of a 12 year old, I am SO PROUD of you. Safety has to come first, and don\u2019t let someone\u2019s anger at your choice make you doubt that you made the wrong one. This will happen over and over as you get older, get more freedom and start dating. People get pissy that you don\u2019t want to drink too much, or get in the car with an impaired driver, or accept a drink from a stranger, or give someone on a dating app your address. Keep thinking smart, what you did here was 100% the right move.", "NTA you were very smart to take precautions.", "NTA at all. You are incredibly smart and I hope if I have a daughter she\u2019s got a good head on her shoulders like you. \nYour age and gender make a hot target for online predators. Bringing your dad to have your back just in case is was the right choice. I applaud your dad as well for being there to support.", "NTA - you don\u2019t know Danny and you did the right safe thing. The only thing may have been for you to share that your dad was coming or introduce them so she wouldn\u2019t worry that there was a person who was watching you both.", "NTA... I can understand Danny getting mildly upset but her reaction is extreme and a bit sus. You might want to be careful about Danny.", "You're absolutely NTA and please keep doing this. It's great that Danny was who she claimed to be, but she could easily have not been. Maybe next time warn whoever you're meeting, though (and take note if they back out!)", "NTA. You were very smart and I'm glad you have an adult who trusted you enough to come with you just in case something happened.", "Definitely NTA.  You did the right thing! Safety first and if \"Danny\" cannot see that then they're not a good person to have in your life.", "NTA and that\u2019s a bizarre thing to be mad about which gives me the vibes that you avoided something bad.", "Kiddo, you are wise beyond your years. NTA!!!  Proud of you.", "NTA at all! You did the safe thing, and Danny should understand that if she really cares about you.", "NTA...  You did the right thing.  Trust is something earned, not freely given.  Your friends online, that great, but in real life, bad shit happens all the time. Meeting someone in real life for the first time does carry risks.  Period. \n\nAs a mom, I would not let my kids meet one of their online friends without me there.  Doesn't matter how much time they have spent online, doesn't matter how well they get along.. its just not going to happen.  \n\nAnd as a teen girl, you will have to take these types of precautions a lot in your life.  New friends, dates, events, parties..\n\nI'm actually shocked that Danny's dad dropped her off at a park in a strange town, to meet an internet friend and didn't stick around himself. I just cannot wrap my head around taking that kind of risk with my kids safety.", "I think Danny could be part of trafficking ring, wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she try\u2019s to meet up again with you, but she suggests you leave your Dad at home. Don\u2019t do it, stay safe.", "As someone around your age, NTA. You did everything right and took measures to protect yourself just in case. It\u2019s a dangerous world for people of our age and gender, you can never be too careful.", "NTA. I honestly don\u2019t trust her after that.", "NTA in the slightest! Your parents should be so proud that they raised you to enjoy life and seize opportunities with new friends while still being aware of potential dangers and considering your safety. Why would Danny's father let her meet a stranger in a strange city unsupervised? Don't let anyone convince you that you did anything wrong here.", "NTA!\n\nThis was very smart of you! Very mature way of thinking, she might come around once she calms down. \nMeeting an internet friend for the first time can be scary and even dangerous so better safe than sorry. You can never be 100% sure there is nothing \"fishy\" going on.", "NTA", "NTA! I have an Internet friend I've known for years, and after knowing him for 3 years, at your age, I went to see him. We still both brought our parents\n\nThe Internet is dangerous as hell and you never know, even if someone is the age and everything they say they are they could still be violent or dangerous. You practiced good safety", "NTA. Thank GOD you asked your dad to come with you, that\u2019s the most responsible thing when meeting someone from online. Your friend is being really unreasonable and irrational, and taking something personal that isn\u2019t personal at all.", "100% NTA and very smart!!\n\nI was over 18 when I went to meet an online friend and I still brought my mom. My friend also had her family and everyone was down with this situation because we all understood that this was a risk! Everything worked out just fine and was great. \n\nYou made a very smart decision and I\u2019m VERY proud of you. Don\u2019t let anyone convince you otherwise.", "NTA- you are 14 and were very smart to be safe. Honestly, shame on her parents for not making sure she also was safe by being nearby. If you explained your reasoning of just wanting to be extra safe and she can\u2019t understand it, then it\u2019s time to cut contact.", "NTA - You did exactly what you were suppose to do.  Never meet people that you meet online without letting your parents know.  You told you dad and her supervised from a respectable distance because he trusts you to make good decisions.  This \"friend\" of your that is getting mad because you put your safety first is no real friend if they can't understand that a teenage girl want to ensure that they are safe.", "NTA and as everyone said, you did the right thing by bringing an adult with you.\n\nHowever, given that it would be expected that a 14yo girl would NOT come alone, is there any reason you were not up front about it and introduced them?  If she really is a friend, it wouldn\u2019t matter.  If she was a decoy, that visit would have gone very differently.", "NTA. Safety is important. \nAs a father of two teenage girls, I would have insisted that I tag along and do just as your father did.

Your friend should have done the same.", "NTA Despite the fact that danny is who she said she is its ALWAYS best to have a adult around alot of bad shit happening in these modern times you could never be too careful.", "NTA - She could have been anyone, you could have been grabbed and trafficked. Of course, maybe she's feeling upset that YOU could have been anyone and SHE could have been grabbed and trafficked so having been \"spied on\" feels weird. And, I suppose it's still possible that she was upset because her evil plan to lure you to a second location and kidnap and traffic you were foiled by your dad's presence. \n\nAnyone who gets upset about you keeping yourself safe, probably isn't safe to be around. Meeting new people is almost always awkward, but you didn't do anything wrong here.", "Discord is a mix bag of people. Trust is hard to have.

Or given her the heads up your dad would be around during the visit.\n\nIf she pushed back on that you would have known she's NOT SAFE TO BE AROUND. The reason most teens want you alone is to do inappropriate things. Boys/girls doesn't matter. Some want to hang out without an adult, but a first time online meet up is NOT that time.\n\nNTA. I'm in my early 30's. I asked my dad to take me to meet a 16 year old boy when I was 14. We met on a old game called Second Life? We showed up to a 40 year old man. We left before he saw us. My dad gave my phone to the police. I wasn't allowed internet beyond school till I was 16.", "NTA. You win the race for most responsible, street smart and intelligent netizen. Danny, if she thinks about it, should understand that.", "NTA please never feel you are doing wrong when being cautious. That was really responsible of you to consider having a safety net.", "NTA  there's a very old saying that covers this situation. It's \"Better safe than sorry.\" I am a widow and met a guy online who wanted to meet in person. I agreed to meet him at Starbucks because it was a public place with a lot of people around so I felt safe meeting him there. The next time we met, it was for breakfast at a popular restaurant. You were right to be cautious and I hope you never stop being that way.", "NTA - Actually that was a very smart thing to do. A lot of weirdos out there.", "NTA, you did exactly the right things!!! I\u2019m very proud of you for being so mature and safe.", "NTA.  That was a very responsible thing to do.", "NTA.  And I applaud you for having the maturity to bring your parent.

Kudos to your parents for raising a smart kid!!", "NTA.\n\nand I'd flip the script on Danny. \n\n\"Danny, I understand you are hurt. but I'll be honest, after all this time, your reaction is SO over the top that now I honestly believe I did the right thing. Why are you SO angry that I brought my Dad, who left us alone and didn't interfere in our great time? It almost sounds like you stood to gain a lot of money or something, and because my Dad was there, you lost out. Like maybe I was right to bring my Dad along, and it saved me from some consequences. A TRUE friend would care about my safety. A con artist would be mad that I protected myself. So... which are you?\"\n\nPut it out there for all to see.", "Oh honey. OF COURSE YOU'RE **NTA**!!\n\nI'm so sorry that Danny had that reaction. I've been online since I was around your age, which was like 30 years go (yes, we had Internet in the 1990s, LOL), and made some of my best friends back then on online groups, and just like you've described here, I got to meet some of them IRL and it was amazing and so fun!\n\nMy heart hurts thinking about how I would have felt if they'd reacted the way Danny did, just because I tried to be safe when meeting them. And my heart hurts for you that she yelled at you and didn't understand.\n\nBut honey, you are absolutely, 100% NTA. And she's so wrong for suggesting that you didn't trust her. This wasn't about you trusting her. This was about the fact that UNTIL THE MOMENT THAT YOU MET HER IN PERSON, you just had no way to be sure. Kids for real get badly hurt and even killed all the time in situations like this. You were so smart to take your dad along, and so mature to put your safety first. She is immature for thinking anything else. \n\nI know it doesn't mean much, but this Internet veteran and old lady thinks you're really freaking smart to protect yourself while still taking chances on meeting your online friends. I hope this doesn't stop you from continuing to make great friends online, and I hope in future they will be more understanding. But no matter what you are NTA.", "Oh sweetheart you are NTA. \n\nYou are so smart and thoughtful. Im glad you have a good relationship with your dad too. \n\nKeep trusting your instincts- being too cautious occasionally is better than not being cautious enough once.", "NTA. Im very proud of you OP.", "I'm actually going to say NAH.\n\nHaving your dad nearby was a very good idea, but I can understand why Danny was upset. If you look at it from her perspective, a man she doesn't know was following her and her friend was in on it. I could see why that might have made her feel uncomfortable and why she's lashing out. If you had told her beforehand, \"Hey, I'd like my dad to come as a chaperone\" and she'd still had a problem, then we'd be in NTA territory, but I really can't fault her for being upset at you bringing someone else in secret, even if her subsequent behavior has been disappointing (if believable for a 15-year-old). I hope you guys can talk it through.", "NTA, you *absolutely* did the right thing and your instinct to ask your dad to come along was 100% correct. \n\n(And I'm sure your dad is both grateful and proud that you are smart and thoughtful, and also trust him and aren't trying to keep secrets! As a \"responsible adult\" I'm also very proud of you even though you're not my kid!)", "NTA  \nI'm sorry your friend took it that way but you are absolutely not the AH. You were smart and cautious and please, please do that let this affect how you handle these situations in the future. \n\nYour safety will always be more important than hurting the feelings of an online friend.", "NTA. At all.\n\nAlso, it sounds like you've got a great relationship with your dad, that's awesome you trust him to support you like that.", "NTA. You absolutely did the right thing by bringing along your father. It's very immature and worrying that Danny blew up like that.\n\nMaybe in the future you should let the other person know beforehand and suggest that they also bring a parent too. It's like a triple safety method then. If they're a creep they'll probably try to cancel, so you will know beforehand. Or if they're okay, then they have their own person to keep them safe too.", "NTA\n\nI'm a dad.  I'd have absolutely done the same thing for any of my daughters.  You did what you felt was safe for you.  THAT is the most important part.  You wanted to be safe, regardless of anything.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nI'm just a random internet dad, but you did good, and I'm proud of you for thinking things through making that decision.", "NTA.\n\nGood for you for acting responsible.\n\nI know there are predators out there online, it is a little alarming to me that your friend doesn\u2019t seem to acknowledge or realize that. It distresses me that young folks just throw it all out there and put themselves in a potentially harmful situation in those virtual environments, not realizing the real life impacts it can have.\n\nHope for the best, prepare for the worst. Good thing to keep in your head as you make your way through life.", "NTA. I'm actually surprised her dad wasn't there too. What kind of parent drives their minor child to meet an internet friend and doesn't stay long enough to make sure they are safe?", "NTA \n\nDanny isn\u2019t actually your friend, I\u2019m sorry", "NTA. This is the best thing you could have done. I bet your parents are proud of your level-headedness, honesty, and smarts. Danny is either not too bright, or there's more to her side than you're aware. Good job.", "Absolutely NTA and her reaction is way beyond suspicious to be honest! You did the right thing, you're a very smart girl and anyone telling you the opposite is not your friend!!", "NTA, and you were really smart in the way you approached this. If Danny can't understand that, she's not the friend you thought she was.", "NTA. Why can't all teenagers be as sensible and mature as you!", "NTA at all. You did exactly what a mature, responsible young woman should and bonus, you built trust with your Dad. I\u2019d be proud to have you as a daughter. You have common sense. Danny isn\u2019t worth your time if she doesn\u2019t understand.", "NTA. You're an intelligent young woman, and don't her or your other online friends tell you any different. Safety is paramount when you're meeting a new person, whether it be in a public place or otherwise.", "NTA but for the future, this is where white lies shine. A simple \"haha yeah, that's my dad, sorry he insisted on tagging along or he said he wouldn't let me come\"  might have gone over better.\n\nI always used to lie and make my parents the overprotective bad guys. It was just easier than dealing with hurt feelings", "NTA. I met up with some of my internet friends as a teen and one of my parents wad always present. Even as an adult if I'm meeting up with an online bud for the first time I do it in public. \n\nIt's the safe way to do it. \n\nMaybe warn your friend your parent is coming next time so they aren't surprised?", "NTA, smartest 14 year old I've seen yet. Good job!", "NTA in this day and age this is a perfectly safe and smart thing to do.", "NTA You did the absolute right thing. Also it's weird that she didn't do the same thing, I don't understand how her parents let her go alone to meet an online friend in another town.", "NTA. You did the right thing tbh.", "NTA. And very honestly, you apparently was completely right. She just showed you a glimpse of the other side of her personality and it\u2019s not a good glimpse. Obviously in a good mood she\u2019s fine, but anyone that gets that upset by a person bringing an adult with them to meet someone for the first time is definitely not a good friend and a little unhinged. Your definitely a product of your raising. Your parents should be proud of you and I am betting your father swelled with pride when you asked him to chaperone. Always, Always do this for meeting someone in person that you met online! Sorry about your supposed friend though.", "Absolutely NTA, and I am SO proud of you for asking your dad to come with you. I know it must be really hard right now to feel like you lost a close friend but your safety should always come first and if Danny was a real friend she would have understood. Her reaction, at best, shows you she's not someone who has your best interests at heart and that's now the type of person you want as a friend. At worst, like others have mentioned, she could have been a tool to lure you into trafficking or some other dangerous situation. There are unfortunately some really bad people out there and you did the smart thing, ignore anyone who tells you otherwise and maybe join a different server.", "Be cautious, be wary. Teens are getting kidnapped at alarming rates, and they're now switching to elderly women, or even teenagers, being used as baits. You did an incredibly wise thing, and Danny's reaction is very alarming. It's best to let this friendship die out for safety reasons. NTA.", "NTA you\u2019re a 14 year old girl and she could have been anyone. What you did was sensible and safe. It\u2019s what people are always trying to get kids to do when meeting strangers they have met online. If she actually was your friend she would want you to take steps to ensure your safety. You did nothing wrong and her reaction is very strange.", "Nta I'm 35 and you know what I do when I meet up with new people? Tell my parents who, where, the times and turn my location on.", "NTA and I sincerely hope that she don\u2019t just go and meet random people online. Show her this thread, OP!", "NTA, and actually a very smart thing to do", "NTA. You\u2019re completely right to have a trusted adult there. Don\u2019t meet a stranger without one! You met in a public place which is great but you should always have someone you know around just in case.\n\nThis is going to be important, even when you\u2019ve over 18. Public meeting space, and at MINIMUM tell someone where you\u2019re going. Share your location on your phone if you have to as well, if not bring someone along with you. You did the completely correct thing. I get Danny being kind of weirded out by an older man watching you, but their reaction of being weirded out by it is so strange. You were completely right to bring your dad!", "Explain it to Danny that she's a in the wrong for not doing exactly the same as you did, how was she suppose to be 100% sure you weren't some 45 year old guy that would've kidnapped them right off the bat. That or just say that was the only reason you were even allowed to go meet your online friend in person, As I know if your father knew what was going on you never would've had to ask him to come along in the first place.", "NTA!! My only observation was perhaps you should have mentioned straight away he was there", "NTA. That's actually very sensible for someone your age. Maybe you could have told Danny ahead of time that your dad was there. Too many bad things happen online. Some guy in my town is a registered sex offender now because he was trying to lure a 13 year old girl, who ended up being an undercover cop.", "NTA - I know that they\u2019re calling you an asshole for this on Discord, but you did the right thing by trusting your gut. It didn\u2019t wind up being a bad situation this time, but don\u2019t ignore that internal alarm bell that goes off. At the end of the day, what you did was perfectly acceptable. Well done!\n\nOf course her other online friends will take her side. There\u2019s a bit of herd mentality there, but you\u2019re never the asshole for ensuring your own safety.", "NTA- good thing you're cautious OP. Sure people meet some good people online but you just can't trust anyone that easily.", "Absolutely NTA.\nStay smart kid, nothing is worth your safety. You are a great kid to listen to your guts and ask your father to accompany her.\n\nNever second guess your instincts to keep yourself safe.", "NTA you are 14 years old meeting some stranger you only ever met online, that\u2018s how people, more often than not girls your age, get traficked, if your friend doesn\u2018t understand that, maybe this person isn\u2018t your friend after all. you and your dad are 100% right here and don\u2018t let anyone tell you otherwise", "NTA. What you did was a mature smart move. I'm an adult in my 30s who is VERY against letting anyone have access to my location on my phone and I still will turn it on if I go to meet an online friend, or bring a irl friend if they're available. \n\nI figure Danny's issue is one of three things. \n\n1. She was part of some sort of plan to harm you. \n\n2. She realized she was also at risk and is embarrassed she didn't have someone to watch her back. \n\n3. She is immature (not for a 14 year old. But in general) and sees this as an attack on her ethics. \n\nAnyway why she's acting like this is unimportant because you did the right thing.", "NTA. I have a firm rule that I have always had that\u2019s if I\u2019m to meet an online person we\u2019ll be meeting by the local police station. And I want a good clear picture/screenshot of them that I\u2019ll send to at least two people before hand with an idea of where we\u2019ll be going and when.\n\nAnyone not okay with that is immediately blocked and flagged. \n\nI have friends in the justice system who\u2019s commented that it\u2019s a very sensible and sadly very much a needed security measure even in my relatively low crime area in a reasonable low crime country.", "NTA\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing.  Danny is either legitimately upset because you didn't trust her (again, the absolute right decision) and she'll get over it, or you were right in not fully trusting her.", "NTA  I actually want to commend you for your safe thinking. You didn't do anything wrong. I can only hope that when my daughter is your age she'd ask the same from me if she didn't feel 100% safe and comfortable. Please don't beat yourself up over this, you did exactly what you should've done in those circumstances. I'm just sorry your friend doesn't see it that way.", "NTA\n\nIts sad to say that the world we live in, you have to be very suspicious of everyone, but especially those online.\n\nShe may feel this is a sign you didn't trust her, but sadly there are too many horror stories where people have been duped and hurt.\n\nYou did the right thing and I wouldn't let her convince you otherwise.  I wouldn't say she was lucky to have met with online people and not having anything bad happen because I think the majority of people are decent, but you only have to be unlucky once.  I have to say if I met someone on line and than notice a stranger man staring at me/us for the day, it would freak me out.\n\nI would say though maybe you could have introduce your father when you turned up and he could have left you both to it or maybe he could have been more discreet and watched you from a lot further.", "NTA but I would suggest if you have an encounter like this next time to insist first meet be a parent meet as well. I\u2019ve told my boys (11 & 4) to openly blame me for the suggestion. I won\u2019t even let them visit a classmates house until I\u2019ve met the parents. Most kids/teens may not like it but do respect it.", "First, I am SO glad that you were behaving safely and wisely.  It's a thrill to meet people you've corresponded with, and I've done it myself as an adult!  \n\n\nYou were NTA.  \n\n\nBUT, I'd advise going forward, anybody you plan on meeting like this, tell them upfront that your dad will be hanging out well to the side for safety reasons, giving you and them privacy but also as a backup resource.  That will head off bad operators who are catfishing.", "You are absolutely NTA you did the responsible and safe thing. Danny has no right to be angry at you for being safe.", "Definitely NTA. You did a mature and sensible thing which more people your age should do! \n\nDanny shouldn\u2019t be upset about you wanting to ensure you protect yourself.\n\nWell done for being responsible and conscientious!", "NTA\n\nNot at all. You 100% did the right thing and that took a lot of guts.\n\nHad she been a runner for traffickers, she would have had you alone and no one would have known what happened to you.\n\nMore people should follow your example!", "NTA. If she\u2019s mad, there\u2019s a reason going on she\u2019s not telling you. Most genuine friends would be supportive of taking safety precautions. I honestly believe there was something more nefarious going on ( I.e sex trafficking) and you foiled the plans . I\u2019m glad you were smart and took care of yourself", "NTA - your real friends will prioritize your safety, and understand when you do the same. keep taking care of yourself!", "NTA \n\nYou're 15, if my children went to meet with friends I'm meeting their parents atleast once before they hangout together.  It's just good parenting because as a child you're not the responsible party.\n\nDanny has issues, whether they be with her parents, authority, or whatever.  None of that involves you.\n\nAlso, I'm an old millennial, I have discord for specific things, what is with Gen Z just using discord for random strangers?  Like, how did you stumble onto discord to meet Danny without a mutual?  Something seems off here...", "NTA\n\nAnd given her reaction, Danny is not your friend. If she was, she would understand.", "NTA, you made a smart and mature choice to ensure your safety. If Danni can't understand that then that's her problem and maybe the friendship has run it's course. You did nothing wrong, if anything you just earned yourself huge trust points from your dad/parents.", "NTA\n\nI am incredibly proud of you for being so responsible about your safety. That is a very odd reaction from her. While I\u2019m sure she probably didn\u2019t like being watched without knowing it, she should understand your concerns as another young woman.\n\nYou did not do anything wrong here, I\u2019m glad you were safe.", "Definitely NTA. You made a really smart choice, I'm sorry that it might cost you a friend, but please do this every time. On a side note it is not unheard of for young girls to lure other young children to unsafe places to be kidnapped.", "NTA - it was a very smart thing to do. Kudos for your dad for making sure you were safe too. You can not be too careful.", "NTA.  Your actions were both smart and reasonable.  Having said that, I do get how she might have felt weird about it because you didnt mention it within the first 15 minutes and instead she thought some creepy guy was stalking the two of you.", "Friends coming ago but you are only one in the world, imagine if something did happen to you. \nNTA", "NTA at all. I'm actually very impressed by how smart and responsible you were in this situation. I'm sure your dad was too. Unless she was trying to pull something, there's literally no reason for her to be upset about this. Her being that upset is a serious red flag. I know it sucks, but it sounds like you are much better off without her in your life.", "NTA. Both you and your dad were in the right here, this Danny girl is off her rocker if she\u2019s upset about this.  In fact it also speaks volumes about her that *she* didn\u2019t also have a parent or chaperone there for her safety as well.  Distance yourself from her.", "NTA\n\nIn your 20s and 30s, this is exactly what all of your girlfriends will tell you to do on blind dates. Have someone you know in the bar with you when you meet someone new. Or, sometimes just text a friend when you get there and when you leave and a picture of when you get home to make sure you're okay. \n\nThis is Women's Real World 101. Is it messed up we have to take precautions like this? Yes. Yes it is. You're not even saying anything about your friend. You are 2 teenagers meeting in a park. Anything could happen.", "NTA, you are a minor and bringing a trusted adult with you to an uncertain situation like this is definitely a smart thing to do. It sounds like the chance of a problem was unlikely but even so, it doesn't hurt to be safe.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA and smart to bring your dad with you.\n\nIf you meet an online friend again, you might consider introducing him and then asking him go sit on the bench. From Danny\u2019s perspective, there was an unknown man watching the two of you. That\u2019s exactly the situation many of the comments recognize as *why* it was smart to bring your dad but from the other side.", "NTA. You prioritised your safety which is great.", "NTA. Yikes! Danny sounds super sketchy now for getting angry about something like that. I'm glad you brought your dad along!", "NTA, at all.  You are 14.  People online can lie about all sorts of things, and there are people out there that will prey on young teens.  Luckily, Danny is not one of those people, but you had no way of knowing for sure until you met her.  Bringing your Dad was a smart move, and he was a good father to hang out back out of the way and just keep an eye on things.  Please continue to exercise caution when it comes to meeting people online in real life, you never really know who someone is.  It's not an insult to them, it's just common sense.", "NTA.  She sounds fishy.", "NTA at all, you sound really smart and your Dad sounds lovely. Anyone genuine shouldn't be offended by you being safe and cautious", "Bro how can anyone get mad at an individual for being safe?  Do they not understand how big an issue human trafficking is?  NTA", "NTA. You exercised good judgment by making sure you'd be safe with an online stranger. The fact that she was so offended honestly raises some red flags.", "NTA. And the fact that she got upset is a red flag. And the fact that she met up with you without an adult is a red flag.", "NTA. It was very smart of you to bring your dad along.  It was also very cool of him to sit at a distance to watch and give you the independence to meet your friend.  Do not let the grief you are getting about this change your future actions. You did the right thing and kept yourself safe.", "NTA. This is how to be safe", "NTA - We're from the UK. When my son was 13 he made an online friend who lived in New York. By happenchance, his dad took our son to NY on holiday and son arranged to meet his online friend (like you did) in a park. His father accompanied our son and there was no secret about it. To our surprise, the NY boy didn't have anyone with him. They hung out for an hour and then said goodbye. Basically, there's no problem with what you did.", "NTA. You absolutely did the right thing. Never second guess that decision.  Drop Danny should the nastiness continue. It could have been a trap. You were very smart", "NTA.  Op even 20+ years ago when I went to meet an online friend, I took another friend with even even though I was an adult.  Sometimes the person you are meeting is who they say but occasionally they are not.  Your decision to take your Dad with you was a safe and responsible on3", "Absolutely NTA what you did was smart and mature.", "NTA. Danny should understand. You were very reasonable to do what you did, and I\u2019m so glad you put your safety first.", "Nope.  NTA.  You were right, and she just proved it by flying off the handle.  Any normal person without a long con agenda would probably just say, \"makes sense\" and move on.  You're doing what you're supposed to do and it's going to put a good head on your shoulders as you mature.  You will gain and lose internet friends over the years.  Don't sweat this one.  And next time you meet anyone from your online friend group, BRING THAT DADDY", "*Our other online friends have been mostly taking her side and now I\u2019m reconsidering my decision*\n\nDon't reconsider your decision.\n\nYou are an under age minor talking to virtual strangers on line. Most of them might be who they say they are but you have know way of knowing that. 'Danny' might have been a 51 year old man for all you know.\n\nI'm surprised that Danny was traveling with her father (she didn't have school?) and he let her meet up with a stranger (no offense but you could have been a 41 year old predator) in a strange city. And who suggested the park-did you mention it in your chats? Does she know  enough about your city  to suggest meet up places? Why not meet at McDonalds or have you suggest a meeting place since it is your city?\n\nHer reaction seems overblown to me because we have been warned over and over again to practice internet safety which includes never meeting up with internet strangers alone. Your father was there to make sure that nothing crazy went down. Just because you shared secrets doesn't mean that you can trust her fully and she should be glad that someone was looking out for both of you.\n\nI know it hurts right now but you should stop talking to Danny. She doesn't seem to understand that your safety comes first. You don't 'know' her despite telling secrets. Your father was there to keep you safe and not to spy on you. Remind the others that your safety trumps Danny's feelings. And if they keep harassing  you, block them and find another group.", "NTA it was very smart", "NTA. you were incredibly smart and did the absolute right thing. please continue to use these safety practices for meeting people, it is a great thing and will help protect you from harm.", "NAH\n\nYou: Smart to bring dad, but doesn't communicate to new friend that strange adult now watching new friend. \n\nHer: Should have brought her dad but now alone without dad, weirded out that creepy adult staring at her, new friend says that was her dad whole time, but didn't say anything.", "NTA. I applaud your common sense!", "NTA and also what super smart of you to do. You never know. Is strange that she is mad about it since she is also a girl. Don\u2019t change always take your parents with you with meeting someone new.", "NTA, in any way. You're 14, and you were meeting someone in person from the internet -- you did exactly the right thing. I'm sure your dad appreciates it too, knowing you're making smart decisions about your own safety.\n\nAs for Danny, the fact that she and your other internet friends didn't understand that and now berate you for it is a giant red flag. Their lack of attention to or care for internet safety makes you unsafe too. I'm sure this situation hurts, and I'm so sorry. But I encourage you to continue setting healthy boundaries and looking out for yourself as you have. Your safety is most important.", "NTA. OP, that was a smart thing to do. Be proud of yourself! Most kids your age aren't cautious and that can end up badly. Do not feel bad or guilty.\n\nDo be suspicious of Danny's anger. I understand being mildly offended that your friend thinks you may be an axe murderer. But the logic behind making sure your safe meeting an internet friend is sound. The fact that she has zero understanding and just went into bashing you is a major redflag. \n\nTell her you would do it again, and that her reaction is making you uncomfortable. I would also be wary about meeting her alone in the future...again based on her reaction.", "NTA - It is a red flag that anyone would be angry or confrontational about trying to be safe.  It wasn't like your dad was right there, he was the wingman off on the side, doing what a dads should do.  Protect and look after his kids.\n\nYou got a good dad.  Danny sounds very sketchy, may have dodged a bullet.", "NTA! Absolutely not! You are just 14, it was a very good decision of you to ask your dad to keep an eye on you. Why is your friend so upset? If she has nothing to hide, she has no right to be upset.", "You did the right thing. \n\nSo, one of two things. Either she was legit and just mad you didn't trust her, which means she stupidly walks into meetings without safety. Or, she was not legit and you saved yourself from being kidnapped.\n\nEither way, you went home safe and sound -- Good for you!\n\nNTA", "Exactly. The fact she got weird and left as soon as you said it was your dad is a red flag. The messages prove that. I\u2019m glad you took him", "Absolutely the smartest thing to do bringing dad along to watch out. \n\nIt probably would have been better for dad to introduce himself and just say he\u2019ll be a couple tables over if they need anything, instead of accidentally scaring the shit out of Dani. It would have the added benefit of making him visible to anyone who would mean her harm.", "It is an unfortunate part of the world we live in.", "Agree!  NTA.  When she said \u201cin town with MY father\u201d it would have been just as logical to assume he would be accompanying her too.  He should have.", "Read about Karla Homolka, Canadian serial killer who was the first contact to get young girls to trust them. Then she killed the girls ... So, good for you staying alive.", "She\u2019s absolutely NTA for bringing her dad, but she should\u2019ve been up front about bringing him. Otherwise, in her friend\u2019s own words, her dad is just a strange man watching them. That\u2019s the same situation we\u2019re praising OP for being aware enough to protect herself from, but from her friend\u2019s perspective.\n\nStill, now that it\u2019s clear, it\u2019s ridiculous to be mad about it.", "[removed]", "Right!?\n\n Good for you OP and I'm glad you trust your dad to back you up. All around good decisions were made.\n\n Danny needs to chill.", "They had spent a lot of time video chatting. The odds that Danny was really a 40-year-old guy were pretty slim.\n\nBut it was still sensible to bring someone with her.", "Yes I do that too. I even share my location with someone and keep my phone on me at all times and carry a Powerbank with me as well so that I'm able to get tracked if I didn't text or respond after a certain time. Sure tracking is mostly seen as a bad thing but you can use that to your advantage too!", "Outnumbered? They ain't wrestling...", "They did video chat so OP knew she was a real teen girl, but, like you said, it's still possible that Danny was indeed bait for trafficking. She *did* nope right out of there when she realized there was an adult witness. Maybe because now she thought OP was the bait? JUST DON'T MEET ANYBODY EVER! LOL.", "This is an excellent point about Danny's actual age vs her appearance.", "I was wondering if anyone else would point this out. Op went to a meeting with another teen...and op bought a full grown man the other didn't know about. I'd have noped out of there too at that age.", "You're absolutely right.  That never hit me but it's very possible that Danny just looks young but could be an adult looking for relationships in the wrong place.", "This is my thought on it. I wonder if part of what has Dani so upset is it's making her think OP is the one being used to lure her into something suspicious - after all, from her perspective she met her cool online friend, then noticed an adult man clearly watching them, then learned OP knew he was there all along.\n\nOP is definitely not the A for bringing her dad but I do think next time she could stand to be a little more transparent about it (and also maybe phrase it more along the lines of him being her ride - the other reason Dani may be so upset is that no-one likes being accused of something they would never do, even as obliquely as the \"just in case\" comment.).", "Everyone is repeating that Danny may have been a decoy for a trafficker. It could also be as simple as Danny being offended that someone she shared her deepest secrets with felt the need to bring a safe person to their first meeting. To be clear, I feel OP was 100% right to do so. But I can imagine as a naive teenager being fixated on, \u201cI trusted you with my secrets but you don\u2019t trust me to be who I say I am???\u201d", "Could Dani have been a decoy? Sure! Was it smart of OP to bring her dad? Yup!\n\nBut that is different than Dani \"probably\" being a decoy. There is a small but meaningful chance that she was a decoy, but it is not more likely than not. Likely Dani was just a person who wasn't aware of the dangers and took offense to being called a potential human trafficker. After all, it isn't like Dani did anything that particularly suggested that she was a trafficker before she got offended by OPs explanation. All of what she did was remarkably standard fare.", "Is there a single case of a \"decoy teen\" being used to befriend a kid online and arrange to meet them so they can be kidnapped and trafficked?\n\nIt sounds like something I might've read about had it actually happened.", "As a thought experiment, imagine Dani\u2019s version. \n\nHer internet friend actually did turn up with a secret older male who was watching them.\n\nHow much harder would you be screaming OP is a decoy?", "AI and video trucks are so good now, too, that even the video chat doesn't exactly prove she was really a teen girl. NTA for being safe, especially as a minor.", "or Dani is a 15 year old that is just taking this too personal because they\u2019re a child. there is absolutely nothing to suggest that they\u2019re a decoy in this situation.", "if Im meeting someone for a date, that I've not gone out with before, and they have an issue with my taking a picture of their car or sending a description of them/clothes/car to my friend, that's not someone I go out with.  if my feeling of safety isn't more important to someonethan a fleeting feeling of offense that I might worry about my safety with you, I'm out.", "Don't want to be rude, but from Danny's perspective OP could be the decoy for the traffickers, having an older guy watching them from afar without any heads up or introduction. No wonder she got scared and bailed", "Yeah, ideally both kids and both dads would have all met up at once - or at least both dads could have spoken on he phone.  That would have required OP to tell Danny that their dad was coming along ahead of time.  If Danny were really a 40-year-old creep, letting them know ahead of time that OP's dad was joining would have also been safer - the creep version of Danny would have probably bailed entirely, and OP wouldn't have been in the same park even.", "Dani's reaction is what made me more suspicious of her.  What kind of 14 yr old girl gets ***that*** angry at an unobtrusive safety measure?   Her reaction was way overblow.   I'd think at 14, having someone's parent nearby would be a common occurrence.", "Agreed. While I think the people arguing against young trafficked women being used as decoys are ridiculous, I also don't think that was likely the situation here.\n\nIt sounds like Dani was just a typical naive teenager not thinking very clearly, whose feelings were hurt that OP didn't \"trust\" her to be who she said she was. She is an AH for not understanding that it wasn't a personal slight, and that OP was smart to be safe and cautious. But I don't think she was a criminal.", "I agree that it is extremely unlikely she is a trafficker. There is just sooo much panic from fake stories. I think people think it\u2019s much more common and/or who is actually getting trafficked. \n\nThe only thing that set up tiny alarm bells was that Dani wanted to leave to get ice cream with her until she said it was her dad. Then bailed instead of bringing OP to ice cream. \n\nBut most likely she is a naive teen that got upset.", "I watch so much ID and they spoke to trafficked teens and some of them said that they did not not meet men they met women or other teens. One said that if it was a dude she would not have even gone to the meeting place.\n\nEdit:  here is a quick article [article](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/2018/11/01/police-children-recruiting-other-kids-for-human-trafficking-at-schools/)", "Scams like this are like rule 34.\n\nIf you believe someone might fall for it, someone else has already tried the same scam.\n\n(And worse: another person has probably fallen for it.)", "It's actually a rather well known and used tactic sadly, there are cases even before the internet existed where a teen or child was either groomed or forced to bring in new victims", "As another commenter notes, Ghislaine Maxwell literally used young women to befriend and lure other young women. It's not rare, it's common practice. Most teenage girls aren't going to trust a man these days, or even a grown woman they don't know (with the rare exception of the few EXTREMELY naive girls from homes with very little supervision that she lured in herself, whose parents somehow allowed them to go off traveling with a strange woman under the guise of \"jobs\" even though they were only teenagers). Many, if not most of the girls she brought into Epstein's \"stable\" were brought in by other girls who were already there, under her direction. She would ask them if they knew other pretty young girls who were interested in working/traveling with them, and they would reach out to acquaintances, girls they met in clubs, at school. It is not a reach to suggest that this happens online as well in similar networks and situations. It is, if anything, obvious and logical.", "Gislaine Maxwell used decoy teens for Jeffrey Epstein.", "Isn\u2019t that what Ghislaine Maxwell did for Jeffrey Epstein? \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what Ghislaine Maxwell was doing for Jeffrey Epstein. \n\nAnd what her trafficked underage girls were doing to others.", "Well young women are often used to lure in other girls but they are usually a little older like 20s not also teenagers from what I\u2019ve seen.", "Um\u2026..Jeffrey Epstein did it. The girls roped in their friends and acquaintances. They were sent out to get other young girls. This isn\u2019t new.", "People fall for moral panics all the time. Pok\u00e9mon cards are satanic. DnD is the devil. Rap music. Child trafficking is the current one to be way overblown. Not that it doesn't happen, but its largely a conservative moral panic.", "Yes, and it\u2019s not new\u2026 I think the most famous case was made into a movie called The Changling\n\nIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart.\n\nOP- you\u2019re NTA, you\u2019re very smart and you should do that everytime", "https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=1596778&page=1", "Ive seen it on dateline i believe", "NIXVM used young women to recruit other young women for sex trafficking purposes. I remember minors being involved as well.", "Yes. Try reading up on Jeffery Epstein. Teens he abused often recruited more. It\u2019s done with brain washing and threats.", "Google the phrase \"teen prostitute used to lure other girl\" and you will see how frequently this tactic is employed. \n\nI just want to state from the outset I do not believe in the terminology \"teen prostitute\"; these are clearly trafficked minors. But that is the prevalent terminology used online in news articles, sadly.", "There was a girl in my school who tried to get other girls to come visit her \"friend\" who according to her was a really cool guy who gave her candy. Not every case is a organised trafficker that make the news or true crime websites and books", "Not online, this happened before the internet but the serial killer Paul Bernardo used his wife as a decoy to kidnap teen girls", "I think it\u2019s super unlikely her dad had a business trip to OPs town and that he would bring his daughter.", "I don\u2019t understand why more people aren\u2019t picking up on this. I\u2019d bet Dani felt pretty threatened by dad being there. How was she to know that it was actually OPs dad and that OP wasn\u2019t the decoy? I\u2019d have gotten out of there, too.", "You know that is also true. I'm more surprised Danny's dad didn't come to the meet up for the parents to know who they were, especially considering this is OP's home city but Danny is visiting and her dad is all yeah cool go meet someone in this city you never met before while I am working. In that situation it is 100x weirder to me that the person who initiated (Danny) is alone in a new city w her dad's blessing to meet someone they met online as a minor. \n\nBut you do have a good point.", "Danny should have had an adult with her, which really makes me think she was a decoy.", "Honestly Danny should not be meeting anyone alone and is very strange that she did and her dad brought her to a work trip to just let her hang around alone in a different city in another state", "True!", "I agree completely. I had an internet friend when I was 15 (now 39) from NJ and I lived in MA that I had been talking to since I was 12. My family went to Six Flags NJ and we convinced our familes to meet up for lunch at a hotel on our way back to MA. There's no way in hell I or my family would have agreed for me to go alone. Because we had all met that time, I was able to go see him again on my own and stay with his family for a week.", "Makes me less suspicious actually. Seems very on brand for a 14/15 year old girl to be overly upset that the internet friends they trust a lot evidently doesn\u2019t trust them as much. It\u2019s a slightly hurtful thing that adult brains rationalise away because we understand the dangers, I\u2019m not surprised a naive teenager doesn\u2019t.", "Teenagers are constantly getting weirdly angry about safety measures. Teenagers are reckless as hell, and get weirdly peeved by efforts to supervise them and get them to be safe.\n\nThat said, I do agree that it was overblown, but I think that teenagers often react in melodramatic overblown fashion in response to any effort to limit their activities because of danger (typically because they downplay the danger).", "You also have to watch out for elderly, pregnant women, and kids that come knocking on your door or similar because they could be also in on it (most likely by force) because no one is going to open the door for some random man now especially if it's a woman living alone. They usually play into your sympathy card this way and get you because your defense is down for the nice old lady.", "I can\u2019t imagine having that job. I\u2019m glad someone is looking out for them. \n\nThanks for the link!!", "This is what Epstein's victims were made to do. These 15/16 year olds were victimized, paid, and then offered sums of cash to bring friends.", "It's called the judas goat/judas child.  It is a technique traffickers and abusers and criminals use to draw an unsuspecting victim in.  Sick stuff.", "Yes they do. And it's because the slaver promises them sorts of freedom if they do and they get money", "He didn\u2019t just snatch them up by luring them to a parking lot, though.", "It\u2019s 100% the new Satanic panic. It definitely happens and kids can be lured but it\u2019s not something happening at the rates some people suggest.", "He was traveling for work and I assume they were meeting during the day, he could have been busy and didn't think much of it when Danny told him she's meeting her good friend, especially since they have been video-chatting regularly. It's definitely irresponsible, but a lot of people just don't really think about the risks until something serious happens. I traveled across my country to meet my internet bff by myself at 15. I'm not the smartest xD", "Or a dumb teenager who thinks she's old enough not to need a chaperone to meet up with a friend. I was like that when I was 15. Was it stupid of me? Probably. Was I trafficking decoy? Nope.", "Have you never been a 15 yo teenager? It's easy to forget how stupid and reckless we were, some of us more than others for sure", "Yeah, HerpenDerpen, it sounds exactly like what I would expect from. 14/15 year old girl, and not just because she was hurt that OP didn't trust her. Kids that age usually aren't wild about having adults hang out with them, and I could see her feeling weird that their free and easy meeting was chaperones. But OP, I think you were really smart to bring your dad. That was good thinking, and I am impressed.", "Once again, is this actually something that happens? It seems so unlikely. Traffickers target vulnerable people who they know--undocumented migrants, drug addicts, children who are being neglected or abused. Wikipedia tells me that less than 100 people are abducted by a stranger in the USA every year. That's incredibly rare.\n\nTraffickers surely don't knock on random doors to see if they can grab someone. That makes no sense as a tactic.\n\n>You also have to watch out for elderly, pregnant women, and kids\n\nSo ... everyone?", "I entirely forgot what the name for it was but I knew it was the same tactic they use at slaughter houses which makes the term and practice even darker when you think about it", "Listen I get it! That is fair! We definitely think we are invincible and \"that couldn't happen to us\" - I am guilty of going on a 3 day cruise with an internet friend I'd NEVER video chatted with before when I was 20 .. it was fine thank goodness but now I think, wow what a damn idiot I am!! XD \n\nI think being older and all the true crime lately has made me just think, god, how dumb was I, how could I think that was fine? I am definitely someone now who worries and thinks of any little outcome xD", "Not to mention any *efficient, productive* sex trafficking operation isn't waiting months on an Anime Discord Server to meet with ONE teen. The moment OP and any *'decoy'* teen are more than five hours away from each other, the *'decoy'* is ignoring OP to make closer friends.", "I think the point is more how weird it is for the dad to just bring her along to let her go hang with her online friend unsupervised. Kids do dumb stuff, but the dad allowing it is strange.", "Maybe traffickers don't. Kidnappers and serial killers do. Ariel Costa used his daughter to lure his victims, as well as puppies. Paul Bernardo was helped by Karla in getting their victims.", "Yes, it is something that happens in all kinds of abductions.   Even the one-off cases of r\\*pe  (not widescale trafficking)  there will often be a woman luring the intended victim.  \n\nI've watched numerous documentaries about trafficking, and YES, absolutely yes, traffickers use the aged-out hookers as madams and recruiters.    Most of the girls they traffic are brought into the fold by other girls.", "Traffickers have been using children to lure other children into trafficking for years. Not a lot of studies on it, but often mentioned in passing as a tactic. Example: https://polarisproject.org/blog/2020/08/what-we-know-about-how-child-sex-trafficking-happens/\n\nIt makes sense to me that as the world moved more online, this tactic would move online. Especially because by meeting in person, they take the risk of being confronted with police.", "It is absolutely something that happens, I live in a very well known trafficking area and they use women to target other women specifically. We get warnings every year of certain areas and tactics people use which include using victims to recruit more victims because it earns them a day where they don't need to be abused, it gives them \"Time off\" \n\nLook at Andrew tate for an example, he used other women he was trafficking to recruit and target other women because they would more like approach and open up to another woman than a man. \n\nIt's very much a real thing and happens so often.", "It seems unlikely to you that traffickers would use young women already under their influence/control to lure in other young women by making them feel safe and like they are being brought into situations that are fun and non-threatening? \n\nThat's interesting, because to me it seems . . . obvious.", "have you heard of ghislaine maxwell? that's just one example right off the top of my head.", "If the kids are missing l, how would they know if it were a stranger or something they know? This is a gaslight argument they use to subdue the public concern. People go missing every day and they are mostly never found", "You can believe what you want. Nothing anyone says will change your mind, apparently, and I'm not here to argue. I'm here to say that they are definitely changing their ways. I grew up in a relatively safe area i thought and as a teenager our health teacher came in super solemnly and warned us, especially women, that if you go to a popular mall, go with someone because there were reports of people being taken and trafficked from that very mall. It is something that happens and if you can't see that, then I'm sorry but nothing i say will and it's not my job to educate you.", "https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=1596778&page=1", "People prefer to focus on some boogy man coming door to door trying to snatch people while they pretend to sell vacuum cleaners....I think in a weird way this maybe feels like a safer thought. That we have to be scared of strangers...that's actually less scary than the reality that the people most likely to do terrible things to us, including trafficking, are our uncle, or  cousin or teacher or basketball coach. The reality is more upsetting.", "Yes. You have to be wary of everyone. Duh! It's called critical thinking and being safe. Your incredulosity at being asked to use basic stranger danger avoidance techniques is very misplaced.", "Yes it is, a woman or teenager befriending a teen online, and then meeting them and gaining trust, and then eventually encouraging them to runaway from their homes. This is a much more common method than most (if not all) \u2018beware of new trafficking scheme\u2019. I\u2019ve worked with anti human trafficking groups and this is something they see a lot.", "This actually makes sense.  A decoy works much easier than trying to abduct a kid/young girl/woman off the street, which has been happening a lot lately in the US.  The fact that kids have become more weary makes sense that this tactic would be used.", "Definitely, sometimes I wonder how am I not dead yey with all the stupid stunts I have pulled back then xD I'm certainly happy that I am not a teenager anymore, especially in this day and age", "Yeah, I don\u2019t know why Danny reacted so horribly but a decoy teen isn\u2019t going to spend months talking to someone that lives that far away.", "Why are we assuming that a sex trafficker / decoy are actually located where they say they are?", "Well, I bet she's freaked out enough that she won't do it again, lol. Some parents just think it's okay that their 15yo daughter is going to hang out in the park with her good friend. Some people haven't been around internet enough to always think about the worst scenario, for them kidnapping is something that happens to other people, they don't think it's a real possibility", "The Sam Lawrence case, guy used his daughter to lure her friends. Just to add.", "Ghislaine Maxwell did not go door to door lmao.", ">if you go to a popular mall, go with someone because there were reports of people being taken and trafficked from that very mall\n\nI find it hard to believe that people were being kidnapped from a popular shopping centre and there were only whispered rumours about it. Wasn't it on TV every time it happened? On the front page of the local newspaper? It shouldn't be too hard to find a link!", "There was a LOT of panic about that stuff that wasn\u2019t based on actual events. Statistically you are far more likely to be kidnapped/murdered by someone who knows you than a random stranger. We always had a \u201cwhite van\u201d scare that never actually turned out to be true. That\u2019s been going on for 30 years or more now. Lots of reports but no actual kidnapping. All of the amber alerts we get are from domestic disputes. \n\nChildren are actually safer now than they used to be because of cell phones and markedly less freedoms than we had growing up. You still need to be cautious when meeting people you think you know but the reality is most of the people who harm us or our families are people we know or are familiar with and have built up a level of trust.", "I think it's rational to see that Danny could be offended by the idea that she was coming off as possibly dangerous/untrustworthy. We can see Danny didn't consider OP to be the same, so they're looking at the same thing from two different angles. Being a teenager, she's likely to center the situation on herself and be embarrassed.\n\nOP also should have disclosed that her dad came with her at the beginning of their hang. Even from a safety point of view, *\"I have someone here watching me\"* reduces the chance that any attempt would be made on OP - rather than letting any nefarious actors believe OP came alone and hoping that her dad is fast enough to run over to her if anything is tried. Making Danny aware only after she noticed a stranger watching them is again something that could embarrass her.", "She didn't have to. But she would meet strangers.
