That is exactly the right move. If she can't handle that, you should find a different friend.", "NTA, your safety was absolutely on the line, we\u2019ve all seen enough horror stories to know how this might have ended.\n\nAdding to this, you still don\u2019t know if Danny is safe, oftentimes predators involve someone like her as an intermediary to get your guard down. \n\nUnfortunately my source is dear friends of ours whose daughter was targeted for a trafficking ring.", "NTA. That's an actual crazy thing to be mad about. It's weird that she didn't have an adult there herself too. Horrible things happen and kids get trafficked every single day. You did a smart thing and don't let them convince you that you were wrong.", "NTA, you did exactly the right thing, and if Danny can\u2019t see that, then that\u2019s her problem.", "NTA at all. You did everything right. You put your safety first. You are clearly a clever young woman, and if I were your parent, I would be proud that you handled meeting someone online correctly. You did nothing wrong.", "DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE ONLINE \u201cFRIENDS\u201d!!!\n\nYou were extremely smart to bring an adult that you trust. There are sooooo many stories of bad things happening in these situations. \n\nBetter to lose a friend than to lose your life.\n\nNTA", "Nope, NTA. You acted responsible, took measures to be safe. Something a lot of people don't do when meeting up with online friends for the first time.\n\nDid it make her upset? Yes. But does it make you an asshole if you're just wanting to be save? No.", "NTA\n\nI\u2018m sorry that she\u2018s making you feel bad for being better safe than sorry. You were sensible and please stay like that.", "NTA - you acted in your own best interest. Who knew if \u201cDanny\u201d was bait for human trafficking? Or actually a middle aged dude intent on kidnapping/rape or murder? No one should be mad at anyone for bringing security with them when meeting someone from online for the first time. The fact that she\u2019s so mad makes me suspicious honestly, about underlying intentions. Even if she wasn\u2019t bait from someone else\u2019s scheme what if she wanted you to be alone so she could hit you up for money or ask you to do something bad for her (like shoplifting or other theft). You\u2019re young enough to want to believe the good in people. I\u2019m old enough to be skeptical of people.  Tell Danny that seeing to your personal safety is a boundary you will always maintain. If she\u2019s still pissed about it - she was never your friend.", "NTA - it is wise when you meet internet people to have a safety person.  However, you might have let Danny know a bit earlier than you did.  From her perspective, she was suddenly outnumbered 2 to 1 and hadn't even realized it.  I suspect she is mad at herself for how naive she had been and is projecting that back at you.", "NTA. You were being sensible and mature, and keeping yourself safe is important. It's sad that Danny can't see that-I can sort of understand why she reacted as she did, like you didn't  trust her, and appreciate that she might have initially felt insulted, but you have the absolute right to do what you feel was necessary to feel safe enough to meet.  Maybe when she calms down she'll begin to understand. Your other online friends are TA though.", "NTA, and can I just say, your dad sounds pretty awesome.\n\nHe (and mom?) have raised you to be a smart individual, knowing the potential dangers of internet stalkers, but not making you afraid for the real connections that can be made.  He's also pretty awesome for going and sitting in the park (even if he failed as an undercover operative - no CIA work for him) and letting you spend time with your friend without being overbearing.\n\nSorry you lost your friend, but don't let that change anything you did this time.  Maybe Danny will come around, maybe not.  Sounds like she could learn from the wisdom you have gained.", "NTA. You did exactly what you needed to do to keep yourself safe. It wasn\u2019t wrong for your friend to feel weird someone was watching y\u2019all, but you explained. Especially with all of the cat fishing and trafficking nowadays, you need to follow your gut and take precautions.", "NTA. Those other kids need to learn that the internet is NOT a safe place and full of creeps. Danny could of easily lied about their age and who they are.", "NTA, NTA, NTA. You absolutely, 100% did the right thing. I would be way more than proud if my kid ever asked me to do what you asked your dad. You\u2019re being cautious and safe, especially because you had only talked over discord and not IRL. Whoever is saying differently really isn\u2019t someone you want to be around because they will not have your best interests at heart. Good for you for staying safe.", "NTA. I\u2019m an adult who runs a discord server. To give you some perspective, I would be texting my irl friends and family bare minimum before I met up with someone. Safety matters, and I\u2019m sorry your friend isn\u2019t being understanding. In fact, I\u2019m really glad you stayed safe!! I bet your dad was happy you were safe too.", "Nta Danny sounds like a bad friend for making you feel bad for doing the right thing.", "NTA. You did the best and safest thing you could do while still meeting your online friend. The way Danny and your other online friends are treating you is wrong, and quite frankly, it's a rather odd thing to be upset about.", "NTA You did the right, responsible thing to do.\n\nThe headlines are full of stories of teens who have met terrible ends because they trusted the wrong person.\n\n\rThe worrying thing is that Danny doesn't understand your point of view, because she could become the victim of some bad guy who deceives her.", "NTA, she's angry you didn't trust her implicitly without ever meeting her? That's ridiculous! It was smart of you to have a safe grown up around just in case she happened to be an unsafe grownup. Her behavior seems really suspicious to say the least!", "NTA. \n\nDanny sounds like a possible sex offender. She could be older than she stated. You are a smart young woman.", "NTA - You were smart and responsible. I'm kinda shocked her dad let her go meet up with some stranger in a town away from home by herself. That's questionable parenting.", "NTA, safety first, you did the right thing but maybe could have told them sooner instead of waiting to be asked.", "NTA a thousand times over. You were very smart in what you did, your dad was in the distance and didn\u2019t seem to bother you guys and gave you privacy. \n\nAs sad as it is, you can\u2019t be too careful these days. Just cause you talked to her in video chat and met her, doesn\u2019t automatically everything is safe. Some kidnappers use kids and teens to lure unsuspecting victims, might be rare, but still I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry.\n\nI\u2019m guessing the people who agree with Danny are also young? Don\u2019t mind them, they are talking from a lack of experience and from ignorance", "NTA. Proud of you for putting your safety first and making smart decisions. Good job.", "NTA, and good for you for bringing your dad the first time you're having an in-person meetup. I'm a little surprised Danny's father let her meet an online friend in a different city to be honest! No matter how much you trust someone, especially online, you should always care about your own safety. Adult criminals have been known to use a young person as bait to meet other young people.", "The way Danny responded makes me think Danny's not that safe to be around.", "Honestly, I can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t bring her dad. Or that her dad didn\u2019t have a problem with meeting a stranger.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your friend is shady for being mad about that. Plenty of bad people use teenagers to lure new victims. You sound like a smart person. Let this friend go.", "I know it\u2019s very hard to not feel upset at a loss of a friend. I know all the adults that are commenting ( even myself) forget what it feels like to lose a girlfriend at 14. YOU are a smart cookie for thinking ahead. But I also aren\u2019t mad at the friend, she isn\u2019t being aware of true dangers out there. Taught if you will. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis type of thing needs to be normalized.", "NTA ! not even close , This was the perfect way to go about it .", "NTA. You did very well and i\u2019m glad you trust your dad to watch over you. Keep it up!", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s never an asshole thing to want to take steps to stay safe. Who knows what could have happened if Danny had lied about herself?\n\nThere was a case where a boy met up with his online friend and ended up getting murdered by that friend. And there\u2019s probably more cases of similar traumatic endings out there, but his is the one that came to mind first. What my point is, is that being cautious is NEVER warrant being an asshole move", "NTA \n\nYou did the right thing. Keep those instincts.", "NTA, it\u2019s not like he was sitting with you. Always err on the side of caution! You made the right call and if Danny stops to think for a moment she might realize that\u2019s what clever folks do.", "10000% NTA.\nThis is the bare minimum safety precaution you could have done.\nI get why she is upset but she has to grow up. Give her sometime to cool down and then try to apologize (even though you have done nothing wrong) and tell her that you were afraid someone else could have known about your meeting place and trying to impersonate her (which is not entirely impossible).\n\nI am just wondering if your father was at an earshot and she felt that he was listening to your conversation or something like that.", "NTA. She's being ridiculous. You're being practical. Don't change how you are, the world isn't a safe place and people getting angry with you for taking precautions are a walking red flag.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While it turned out well this time, it very easily could have been some creepy random person ready to snatch you.", "NTA. your friend turning out to be what you expected doesnt make her safe either. Adults have used children as lures to attract and kidnapp other children. Asking your dad to be present was a remarkably mature and adult thing to do for your saftey. As an adult, I would never meet an internet stranger alone. Always always always have a trusted friend or relative with you for saftey. I am sorry that your friend didnt understand, and seems to have ended the friendship. I remember being 14 and losing friends, it sucks! But you can and will make new ones. The only thing I think you could have done differently is maybe tell her before you meet up that your dad will be with you for saftey.", "NTA absolutly NTA NTA NTA... you are 14 - fourteen AND a female...  in a PARK...  enough details and you did the right thing as you should anytime meeting a stranger.

I hope this experience doesn't discourage you from doing the exact same thing the next time you're thinking of meeting an online friend in person. \n\nIt's very strange that Danny took it the wrong way, and even weirder that her reaction was so visceral. At the very least, now you know that she isn't who you thought she was personality-wise, and let's hope that there was nothing more sinister underneath.", "Nta. It's scary how she can't see how creepy it could be to meet with a stranger online.", "NTA. It's pretty weird she didn't also have an adult there considering how old you guys are.", "NTA - That's the proper way to do things, always bring someone with you.", "NTA\n\nYou did the smart and safe thing by asking your dad to tag along.", "You did the right thing since you are someone underage in a world of creeps. I am an adult who flew out to meet someone I met in a game and I checked in with my brother when I landed and when I met the guy. I gave my brother all his info prior to leaving in the event I did go missing.", "NTA. Very smart choice.\n\nI\u2019m sure your dad wouldn\u2019t mind if you made him the \u201cbad guy\u201d and told everyone that you weren\u2019t allowed to meet up without him there. But honestly, these don\u2019t sound like great friends if they\u2019re mad at you about something like this. You might be better off moving on from this group.", "NTA. When I was in my mid-twenties, I remember I was just chilling outside, smoking. These young looking teens came up and asked me for a cigarette. I said no, sorry, I don\u2019t give smokes to kids. They started getting angry and one said what a hypocrite I was, someone bought me those cigarettes and now I won\u2019t share. I was like\u2026I bought them? And the kid asked where I got my fake, if I could hook them up. They thought I was under 18 (back then you only had to be 18 to by cigarettes). I was,like, 25.\n\nAll this to say: Ms. Danny might not really have been a 15 year old girl. She could easily have been a scrawny 20-something, getting paid to befriend young folks online. The fact that she got really angry with you for protecting yourself is weird.", "It was very smart of you to ask your dad to accompany you. Sure, Danny seemed to be who she said she was, but you had no way of knowing that before meeting.\n\nYou\u2019re all young, so I\u2019ll say Danny\u2019s odd reaction most likely comes from general immaturity rather than something nefarious. However, it may be a good idea to take a step back from the friendship for a bit. A friend who doesn\u2019t even try to see your perspective in a situation like this does not sound like a very good friend in general. \n\nNTA", "Nta. You did the right thing, but, since it's a strange man to her, I understand she may have been nervous.\n\nYou were protected, but to her, your dad could be a threat. Especially since you didn't tell her before.\n\nBe honest about your friend/dad watching out for you next time you meet a stranger. Tell them they can bring someone too.", "First off, I am very proud of you for looking out for yourself and doing everything possible to make sure you were comfortable when meeting someone new. You made a smart choice that any genuine friend would've understood and moved on from.\n\nYou are not the asshole. At all. Not in any way, shape or form. \n\nIt's one thing for her to interpret it as you not trusting her, but it's a whole other thing to tell everyone in the discord group and have them gang up on you.\n\nIf there's any asshole in this situation, it's her.\n\nInstead of hearing you out or trying to see it as you just wanting to feel comfortable and safe, she decided to bombard you with a bunch of messages and send a brigade to prop herself up as the victim.\n\nThat is full on asshole behaviour.\n\nShe's showing her true colours and I'm sorry that she's throwing away what seemed to be a fantastic friendship all because your brought your dad along.\n\nAnd all he did was sit, it wasn't like he was being embarrassing and telling you guys where to go or what to do. Man was just sitting and making sure his daughter was okay.\n\nMaybe that's why she reacted that way. Her father obviously didn't care enough to be present when his 15 year old daughter was meeting an online friend. While it's possible he just trusted her judgment, knowing that your dad put in the extra effort to be present mightve triggered something for her and she took it out on you.\n\nShe mishandled it. Badly.\n\nKeep on looking out for yourself \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA Danny is no friend at all.  That she would get upset about a \"friend\" doing what they could to be safe is a red flag.  A huge red flag.\n\nYou did exactly what anyone your age should have done.  Rest easy!", "Good on you for involving your dad. Your safety is paramount. NTA.", "You're a smart young lady, you did everything right and have nothing to be worried about.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Assuming Danny isn\u2019t a decoy, she\u2019s just jealous that her own parent sent her to meet a stranger in the park alone.", "NTA. You choose safety and that is never the wrong choice. You are 14 and a girl and therefore absolutely in danger of perverts. Danny\u2019s reaction is really weird and honestly worrying.", "NAH. Ok, I get everyone saying you did the right thing and protected yourself, but try to think about it from Danny's perspective. She thought she was meeting with a friend 1-1 and then suddenly realizes there has been an older man watching her this entire time, a man she never met and you claim to be your dad but for all she knows you could be the trafficking decoy with a guy behind you scoping the scene.\n\nShe was probably freaked out of her mind and ran away as fast and safe as possible.\n\nSure it's good to have someone making sure you're safe and ok, but maybe it would be nice to inform the other parties involved. You could have introduced them so everybody feels comfortable, not doing so makes you look sketchy tbh", "NTA but maybe the friend was just as careful as you, and she does not know the guy watching is your dad. \nSo OP is scared of human trafficking, but she also might be scared of that.  Or felt weird after being observed by some older man she doesn't know. \nMaybe. \nI don't know a solution, i think OP did the right thing but i can imagine that girl being as anxious as OP is about catfishing, human trafficking etc.", "NAH. It was good to bring your dad. BUT!! I think you shouldve tell Danny beforehand. She's not much older than you, what if she freaked out that your dad is not actually your dad and that she's in danger? I'm surprised nobody mentions this. So yes, it was very good to bring your dad, it's important to be safe, but I see her point too.", "NTA \nYou are a smart young person. Your dad should be proud that you took your personal safety seriously! Kudos!!!", "Thank you for saying this. I think Danny\u2019s reaction is a huge red flag and leads me to believe this meeting was the first step in a patient game, designed to put OP\u2019s guard down.", "NTA. I'm an adult and after being friends with a woman in another state for years online when we first met we both brought people with us. Also the second time we met with our husband's. The third time, we met with our sisters. Now we've been friends for 10 years and we meet up whenever we want with or without Other people. OP did the smartest safest thing.", "To me it seems that Dani was probably a decoy. Traffickers are changing up their MO and getting young girls to get new victims because everyone warns about the creepy guys on the internet. She needs to step back from the \u201cfriendship \u201c", "I agree and disagree.  I think the dad being there covertly was smarter than letting Danny know and suddenly the plans changed and could not meet.  It also allows for a \"true\" meeting.  I am torn TBH about this comment.  I get the outnumbered and she could've been being \"catfished\" as much as the OP was I suppose.  I can just imagine \"bringing my dad, bring yours too\" type of thing might be better?", "Who knows if the part about her Danny's dad is even true."]}
