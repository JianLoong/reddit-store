And if they do I'm going to socially blackmail them into conforming to my demands.\" \nA trigger is a psychological term for something that causes an extreme emotional reaction, ie: panic attacks, mania, dissociative episodes, etc.. which the person affected cannot control their reaction without significant self awareness and coping mechanisms and/or therapeutic intervention.\n\nSomething someone doesn't like, or that makes them uncomfortable is not a trigger. I'd ask your friend if there's something that happened, with the game, because you would hope he would be willing to discuss these things with you.

Because that was the film playing on TV when my abusive ex sodomised me until I bled. \n\nThe second trigger is a certain perfume. Dolly Girl by Anna Sui.

Whenever he beat me, he liked to clean me up after and would delight in spraying that perfume on me and running his hands over my throat. \n\n\n It's been 14 years since I got away but if I get even a whiff of it out in public, my stomach rolls and my chest tightens.

It stems from an incorrect premise that goes something like: \"If *I* am bothered by something, *everyone else* must avoid doing it.\" As soon as a social group with such an ethos expands beyond about 10 people, the intersection of everyone's restrictions basically means it's no longer a free society.", "No way, what!?\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Triggers & Trigger Warnings are getting absolutely out of control.\n\nEdit to clarify: Some TW are totally valid and understandable.

I have asked my close friends not to quote it around me or talk about it favourably, and thankfully it's faded far enough in the public consciousness that I can simply avoid it most of the time. But whether it be still images, voice clips, or just a popular catchphrase, that damn show can still ruin my day twenty-five years in.", "Rhythm games are basically games based around different styles of tapping beats to music like magic tiles. Pfp just stands for profile picture.", "Im not too sure myself. He just has them listed under triggers.

Although im still not sure why they trigger him.", "This is what I was talking about at the comment I made upside. Disliking something is being called \"triggers\" and it doesn't feel right anymore. My arachnophobia was the result of a trauma. I literally extracted a daddy long legs from my ear. Trauma has triggers dislikes don't have it.\n\nAnd I am so sorry those awful things happened to you.

I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "I'm sorry those things happened to you, and glad you are doing well now. \n\nThis is a very good example of triggers, and I appreciate you sharing. I wanted to affirm what you stated that triggers can be anything, smells, sounds, images, etc. There's not a limit to what they can be, and can seem silly to others, despite the seriousness of them to the individual.  So while people shouldn't question people's triggers, I feel like OP could reach out to ask their friend if they would be willing to talk about it, just to be a good friend. The Friend can choose if he's willing to share or not, and OP needs to respect the friend's privacy if he chooses to not share. (it does seem like the friend is misusing the term trigger, but it is still best to respect the situation and not discuss the game around them.)  OP shouldn't let the friend socially bully him into not playing the game, as it's not a trigger to OP, so long as OP respects the mutual space when the friend is present.", "A trigger warning is meant to provide information that something is being discussed, so that people who struggle with that thing can choose not to engage. It's the exact opposite of requiring other people to avoid doing things. It's a tool to allow them to do so, while the people who don't want to do X can keep themselves safe.", "I used to participate in a forum with a person who thought it was reasonable to expect everyone else on the forum to spoiler tag pictures of \\*baby bunnies\\* because she hated them (amongst other random things that most people didn't hate). It's reasonable to ask people to hide animated gifs or pictures of spiders, snakes, etc. imo. But baby bunnies was a ridiculous request, and completely unfair of her to expect every other member of a public forum to remember/abide by her 'rule' (and she even tried to get mods to enforce it).", "Sometimes yes, indeed.\n\nStuff linked to posttraumatic stress - sure. \nStuff linked to suicide etc. as well. Totally valid in my opinion, and I'm very careful around these topics. \n\nBut a trigger warning about spiders in an outdoor Jungle Video, really?! I mean...one might imagine that spiders are present in such.\n\nAnd demanding people change their status because of a rhythm game? I have no words....", "Yes, it can be, that's true.\nA SA survivor might get triggered by the themesong of a show that played in the background during an assault for example.\n\nYet posting a trigger list on a discord and not telling a person they connect with over a certain game that this game now is triggering without any further information, forcing them to avoid certain status updates and so on seems not like a proper usage and I really doubt that there is a trauma regarding this rhythm game in this case.\nIt seems to be used in a manipulative way in this instance, which seems rather toxic.\n\n\nAnd if there are certain shows or games so triggering, including anything surrounding them, therapy is the right way to go.\nNot avoiding everything including quotes linked to those media and wanting others to avoid them too.", "Thanks. That sounds fun", "NTA. Sounds absolutely ridiculous. Send him this link.

Thanks for explaining it.\n\nBut how is OP's friend made unsafe from the mention of this rhythm game or the characters in it? Moreover, is it ever reasonable to question someone's trigger warnings or the idea that the mention of certain words makes people unsafe? \n\nI understand the idea of trigger warnings, but it seems like that there's been a slow conflation of \"uncomfortable\" and \"unsafe\" in the language, such that some people now believe it's the job of others to make sure they're never uncomfortable and any failure of others to police their own language is equivalent to inconsiderate harm.\n\nYou may not be advocating that position, but since you seem to understand this issue better than I, perhaps you can educate me. Feel free to point out where my impressions are wrong.", "Wow. It's like whoever has the highest level of discomfort gets to control the discourse.", "I wouldn't even agree with having to avoid spiders and snakes in that manner.\n\nIf a phobia gets so strong images of the topic of the phobia lead to panic, it's time to seek therapy. \nBecause it reduces life quality by a lot. \nA classical behaviourist therapy can help get rid of it rather quick, with safe and secure gradual confrontation.", "Completely agree. \ud83d\udcaf", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAccording to x/2 +7 rule you are in the clear. (for those who don't know its the formula to see if someone is too young for you it was for funz not to be taken seriously) even if you roll up his half age to 23 you are in the clear \ud83e\udd23", "I think in this case the friend has probably co-opted language and is using it inappropriately. It is possible for apparently innocuous things to trigger someone's mental health conditions (for instance, smells can form very strong memories that trigger flashbacks) but that doesn't sound like what's going on here.", "Not the person you were replying to, but I think you asked some good questions, and I agree with your overall point about the conflation of \"uncomfortable\" and \"unsafe\". Being made to feel uncomfortable isn't necessarily the same as someone else doing harm, and I wish that distinction wasn't being blurred. \n\nHowever, at the same time, I don't think it's fair to question people's triggers, since triggers can be anything that gets associated with a traumatic experience, and even seemingly innocuous things can cause great emotional harm. I have no idea whether the rhythm game is a genuine trigger for OP's friend, but I do know people whose triggers might seem ridiculous, but make sense with context. For example, say that a very upbeat, inoffensive song was playing during a traumatic event. That song might become a trigger and cause immense distress, not because of the song itself, but because the brain has now connected it back to that event.\n\nThere is a limit, though, to how much you can ask other people to accommodate you, especially in larger shared spaces. To that end, I absolutely think it's reasonable to say that you can't accommodate every request for trigger warnings. Overall, I'm a fan of trigger warnings, but just like every other tool, there are situations that they work well for, and situations that they don't, and this seems like a situation that they aren't well-suited for. I've been in servers with huge lists of required trigger warnings, and it just becomes unsustainable. In the end, someone with triggers has to learn other ways of dealing with them besides avoidance, which can be difficult but is also very worth it.", "I had a severe arachnophobia which turned me into a whimpering little git when I see them irl and while seeing the pictures and stuff online or on TV disturbed me. I couldn't even do some bosses or areas in the games I love because they HD spiders in them. I did mentioned it to my friend group so they were careful when sharing memes and stuff about them, but when they did they told me beforehand so I could skip them.\n\nI don't know about triggering in social norms anymore. It was something disturbing in general (like talks about r*pe and such) now getting disturbed bout characters in non-controversial video games? (I don't know about the game so I will think it's non-controversial)", "Can confirm. I used to be really afraid of spiders and just insects in general. Still can't deal at all with larger ones. But you can learn to live with them. Honestly, just found that sometimes posts about spiders actually helped me hate them less. Bit I'm also the kind of weirdo who will deliberately look at pictures of things that I'm uncomfortable with. Like goblin sharks.", "LOL I keep telling him that haha, I call him my big old grizzly bear, he calls me the Whippersnapper \ud83d\ude02", "> There is a limit, though, to how much you can ask other people to accommodate you, especially in larger shared spaces.\n\nThis is a great way to put it. Thank you.\n\nA little while back, a redditor was putting forth the argument that people shouldn't use the word \"flashback,\" because those who suffer from the psychological phenomenon with that name could be triggered by the mention of it. I tried to point out that the word has other definitions, but also, that it's not reasonable to ask people to police every aspect of their language simply because some words might upset others. I was accused of being insensitive.", "Whenever posting spider images or something about suicide prevention I make sure to exclude some people I know would struggle due to this content. \n\nSome games have modes that swap spiders against bears or other stuff. Because it's really common to have issues with that.\n\nI mean, I still think therapy is the best to avoid trouble because it means being able to cope with having to re-home spiders who got into the apartment. But that's something everyone has to decide for themselves, and as long as it works without, all is well. \n\nBut yes, non controversial rhythm and music games now being considered triggering is... Something else.", "Once I looked at macro photography of spider paws I couldn't really keep being uncomfortable with them. \n\nI don't need them to touch me and prefer a bit of distance. But their tiny cute fluffy paws helped me. \nAnd they are fascinating creatures.", "Oh I had therapy. It doesn't disturb me much in non-live situations, if only there is extreme situation. And irl I still whimper once and remove myself from there and ask for help if its somewhere I have to live", "That's a huge success to be honest, and I'm happy it worked that well :-)", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0a it's been fine and feeling good about it.\n\nAnd to consider I was loving those critters before the event that caused the phobia. Psychology is something different..."]}
