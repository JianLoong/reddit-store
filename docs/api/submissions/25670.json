People often donate things to local institutions for specific purposes, as that helps meet the community's needs, which was the case here.

Im sure hes disappointed i feel that i get it. But he made the choice to donate it, if he wanted it to go to a family he could have listed it somewhere for that purpose or asked ppl at the church.

If you\u2019re in the US, please check with your friend to see if they specified use of their donation to the church.

If the nonprofit (the church) cannot use a donation for its restricted purpose, that doesn\u2019t mean they can repurpose it on their own. They have to go back to the donor, and request it be unrestricted. If the donor refuses, the nonprofit is simply out of luck, and stuck with the donation.

So they do nothing, since that\u2019s the only choice they have.", "It\u2019s just their payment same as any ceo", "Maybe irs? Because it was a donation that was not used in accordance for its intended purpose and it is not being used for church purposes. That could affect their tax standing", "So tithe is not a donation?", "So what's the rationale when the SCOTUS has more liberal justices, as it did not that long ago?", "So people who give their hard earned money to help a religious organization should have it taxed again? I get there are egregious abuses but this is not worth it outside of squashing small churches", "yeah ya know if this is something the church does regularly and enough reports of this variety are submitted, it could totally eventually lead to an investigation re tax status  \n  \nwith that in mind, if they manage to create enough of a fuss about it they may just get invested anyway -  \neven if it didn't yield any results it sure would be fun to watch them sweat", "The church would pay the tax not the less intelligent folks donating to them.", "If you donate the money to church, is this after tax or before tax?

Expose the church and your friend should also request the furniture back so he can use it, sell it, or donate it to a worthy cause or family.

You MUST expose this or it starts being on you. I had a neighbor whose kids school had teacher\u2019s aids *stealing* the lunches provided for the kids,and some of those kids got nothing because of it. I told her to talk,and that problem stopped.

A donation given like this can actually be seen as a burden by the other party. \n\nIt's also possible this isn't the exact set so you shouldn't be accusatory without knowing for sure. Sometimes people see donation items as people trying to get rid of stuff and don't really care where it ends up. Furniture costs money, space and time to move so the used market has stuff purchased for thousands going for a couple hundred. Your donation may not have been valued the same as you saw it, nor did you value the labor the official used in moving it around as they saw it. They may have swapped sets and saw that as a fair compromise, which makes asking for the set back more difficult.\n\nSo maybe no one is really the asshole here, but should have communicated better.", "NTA. This is exactly the kind of behaviour that needs exposing. Especially for those in positions of power.

It\u2019s not the first time this will have happened", "Literally every church I was a part of pulled this kind of shit. Church officials are professional grifters. Churches are also exempt from a lot of the stringent requirements that most 501c3s have to go through to get nonprofit status so I doubt they would ever face any repercussions. Churches are shady and should have to pay taxes.", "Yep. IRS for the win.

He doesnt live in luxury.", "No, they can pay their workers what they\u2019d like, which is how those creepy televangelists end up with mansions and crazy cars.   But, as a non profit they must disclose their financials when asked.", "I think getting away with all the things that Catholic priests have is a pretty big luxury.", "The church has an obligation to you the donated item for the purpose that the donor wants", "I think in this case, donation means a donation of physical goods, not money.", "Lack of funding. The IRS has bigger fish to fry than random small churches (plus the vehemently overstated outcry the moment anything church-like starts getting looked into)  even if they do add up to a lot overall. A single millionaires taxes can take a dozen agents weeks to work thru and that's just to enter the data, much less verify.", "The IRS does indeed have bigger fish to fry, but they usually can't fry them because of the lack of funding.

If so, the procedure for handling this is outlined in Matthew 18. *\u201cIf your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that \u2018every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.\u2019 If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.\u201d* In other words, first go to them privately and ask them to correct this, then with witnesses, then before the whole church. Its not impossible that the church official or his daughter made an in kind donation, say a few hundred dollars or a thousand dollars, in exchange for the living room set. Which would still be wrong as it was specifically donated for a specific purpose and just plain looks bad. \n\nAlso, if this is a specific denomination that this church is a part of, you can appeal to the denomination (usually under a bishop or district superintendent of some kind) who can instruct the church to make this right. If they are a local independent congregation this isnt an option. You can try the police or IRS as some have suggested, but the court of public opinion is probably a better and more effective course of action. Just tell your story and let others decide if they still want to donate. to them \n\nAnd no, you are NTA for going ahead and getting to the bottom of this and bringing the truth out. It may be all that is needed to set this right. Jesus kinda did the same thing by exposing the hypocrisy of the church leaders in His time.
