You could argue, as one commenter did, that once you donate something it doesn't belong to you and you have no say over what happens to it, but I'd say - and correct me if I'm wrong - that since this is a local church, and not a big non-profit that cannot be concerned with who you want to give the things you donate to, it probably doesn't have to handle thousands of donations for many different benefactors over a big territory. People often donate things to local institutions for specific purposes, as that helps meet the community's needs, which was the case here. However, if this church is well loved by the community, they'll probably not take well to you exposing the church officials. Something to think about.

Youve said what she did to her house a few times i understand. how was he deceived tho? i mean did they specifically say they would do that? And again if they gave it to someone else wouldnt that still be deceiving him in a way? I get yall dont like where it ended up but its a donation and unless they promised him it would go to a specific thing i dont really see it being an issue. donations get used at the discretion of the ones taking them in. could it have gone to a better use? absolutely. if he had given it specifically to be used by a needy family? then yea id say that was wrong. but thats not the situation. I just dont see a place for ppl to sit and wait being a huge issue.", "so vote that way. I dont think ppl will care especially cause its not like it was taken from another family. if this was supposed to going to a hungry family or like food or something sure thatd be horrible.

No first party knowledge of the discussion. Give it up.  You weren't there. You can't verify if he said if I give you this, can you be used for this.", "He told me if he knew it was just going to go in her living room, he wouldn't have donated it. It was brand new. It's not like his old furniture or anything.", "I would care. I would never donate if i thought it was going to a rich person\u2019s house.", "Ok, but she's definitely not even a family in need. She just had an entire addition installed on her house, as well as a backyard swimming pool. He had said he wasn't that mad it didn't go towards what he donated it for, but he was more mad it didn't even go to a family in need. It went to the Deacon's daughter who said that she wanted it.", "It's not like he said to use it for loitering parents and then they stuck it in a kid's area. They just straight up embezzled the thing. Even with no caveats on the donation, it is a reasonable expectation that a donated good will not just go into a church official's house or whatever.", "so no they didnt make him any promises then. Im sure hes disappointed i feel that i get it. But he made the choice to donate it, if he wanted it to go to a family he could have listed it somewhere for that purpose or asked ppl at the church. I just dont think ppl are going to be very upset that a couch didnt get put there for parents to sit and wait on. Youre allowed to feel the way u do, ur friend too. at the end of the day i just think this is a huge issue.", "okay thats cool. like i said you should vote that way. I dont think ppl would care so i voted the way I did.  we dont have to have the same opinion.", "Wait til.people find out what little of their donated $ actually goes to charity recipients than to salaried and bloat.

If you\u2019re in the US, please check with your friend to see if they specified use of their donation to the church. If they, through an item such as a letter, specified that the gift was for use in the atrium, it may count as a nonprofit restricted donation. A restricted donation can only be used for its designated purpose. If the nonprofit (the church) cannot use a donation for its restricted purpose, that doesn\u2019t mean they can repurpose it on their own. They have to go back to the donor, and request it be unrestricted. If the donor refuses, the nonprofit is simply out of luck, and stuck with the donation. Failure to abide can be a violation of IRS nonprofit regulations. You can then report the nonprofit to the IRS. This will then damage the organization\u2019s standing as a nonprofit, which is critical for a religious organization as it is in essence what allows them to be tax exempt.\n\nThis ONLY works if your friend wrote the purpose of the donation, and has written proof along with the donation. No documentation, no repercussions.\n\nAlso NTA for exposing the church.
