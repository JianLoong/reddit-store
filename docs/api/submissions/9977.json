So this totally annoys me and my mom. My dad is literally the only one who is happy about it cause he's not the one who has to clean or cook etc. So my mom asked my aunt to help cook the food. My mom works fulltime and is only home for about 2/3 hours a day to make food and after that she comes home around 9pm. My aunt said \"no you're the owner of the house so I'll let you do it I'm not gonna help maybe another time\". I got mad and my mom as well but we didn't say anything. My aunt also talks shit about my uncles kids. They don't live together anymore with the kids because of her. I go to school and after school I work so I'm not much home. When I come home the house is always dirty and my aunt never helps cleaning it or anything. Also she is constantly invading my space. She doesn't knock on my door and I don't lock it cause I'm used to my parents knocking. And she goes through my closet which makes me furious. They're staying in the guest room and even there she won't clean the sheets. So we were sitting on the couch and my aunt says \"I'm so relaxed now, I gave myself a vacation\". Mind you my aunt only works 3 hours a week. So I ask \"oh you have vacation from work?\" and she said \"no I don't but I came to your house to have vacation I'm so relaxed for 3 months\". I saw my parents look at each other but none of them said anything cause they're too nice. So I said \"well if you want vacation this is the wrong place our home is no vacation park. We're not expecting you to pay for utilities but at least help out with cooking or clean your own goddamn room.\" I could see on my parents face that I said what they wanted to say. But they did say it was disrespectful. I said \"oh so I'm disrespectful when she is sitting in front of me wearing my brand new pajamas without permission and she comes in my room constantly taking my stuff?\".

I would tell him if he wants them there, he should be the one cooking and cleaning for them. It's not fair to your mom to have to take care of these people on top of working.

You can't take that many liberties. They are being too disrespectful, you are not disrespectful for telling their truths to their face. NTA.

You and your mother should take a vacation away from home until they leave.", "NTA - You know what they say about fish and guests, they start to stink after 3 days.  3 months has to be unbelievably unbearable!  It would be funny if you could park yourself at their house for even a couple weeks and declare \"I'm giving myself a vacation.  What time will we be having our meals and I've brought you some of my dirty laundry that I didn't have time to clean before I left home\"", "NTA\n\nTell your dad you need a lock for your room to keep his thief of a sister from stealing your stuff.\n\nAlso you and your mom can start making him clean up after his guests.", "No, you are the hero your family needs.  I cannot imagine the entitled, selfish behavior your aunt is displaying.  kt", "ESH - sometimes there are cultural differences that don\u2019t always make sense. Aunt and uncle are TA. No question. But OP mentions they are on a visa from another country .Mom and Dad may be immigrants and have a culture of entertaining and hosting and saving face. They may not socially be in a position to change the circumstances. OP is first generation \u201cnew country\u201d and could care less about social constructs as a host. OP, cut your parents some slack, get two locks- one for the outer door when you leave your room and one for the inside when you are in there. Then take them off and paint and help your folks with the repairs after aunt and uncle leave, because you know the rest of the house will be trashed. That will be the greatest respect you could show your parents- that you supported them as people in a difficult situation.", "NTA. Look up the going rates for personal chefs, cleaning services, personal shoppers, drivers, and tour guides, then give the bill to your uncle and aunt. Present an updated one that includes late fees each day of their visit until they pay up or leave.", "NTA.\n\n>she is sitting in front of me wearing my brand new pajamas without permission\n\nI would seriously flip my shit. You need to start setting some boundaries. \"My room is off limits and don't take my stuff without asking\" is not an unreasonable ask.", "Easy answer here, don\u2019t let her come over, ever. NTA.", "Nta you need to lock your room", "NTA,\n\nWow, the entitlement is strong with this Aunt!", "NTA. But your dad is.", "NTA. Someone had to say it and you were the only one with balls enough to do it.\n\nGive her a bill for your new pajamas since she helped herself to them. Then change the locks to the house, put their crap outside and don't let them back in. They can rent a motel for their entitled selves.", "NTA", "Is there a cultural aspect to this that might explain your parents reaction? In my culture the father\u2019s sister can come to her brother\u2019s house and treat it somewhat like that. I still think it\u2019s an AH move but wondering if there\u2019s a bit of a disconnect."]}
