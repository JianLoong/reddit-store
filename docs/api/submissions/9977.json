My mom works fulltime and is only home for about 2/3 hours a day to make food and after that she comes home around 9pm. My aunt said \"no you're the owner of the house so I'll let you do it I'm not gonna help maybe another time\". I got mad and my mom as well but we didn't say anything. My aunt also talks shit about my uncles kids. They don't live together anymore with the kids because of her. I go to school and after school I work so I'm not much home. When I come home the house is always dirty and my aunt never helps cleaning it or anything. Also she is constantly invading my space. She doesn't knock on my door and I don't lock it cause I'm used to my parents knocking. And she goes through my closet which makes me furious. They're staying in the guest room and even there she won't clean the sheets. So we were sitting on the couch and my aunt says \"I'm so relaxed now, I gave myself a vacation\". Mind you my aunt only works 3 hours a week. So I ask \"oh you have vacation from work?\" and she said \"no I don't but I came to your house to have vacation I'm so relaxed for 3 months\".

We're not expecting you to pay for utilities but at least help out with cooking or clean your own goddamn room.\" I could see on my parents face that I said what they wanted to say.

They may not socially be in a position to change the circumstances. OP is first generation \u201cnew country\u201d and could care less about social constructs as a host. OP, cut your parents some slack, get two locks- one for the outer door when you leave your room and one for the inside when you are in there. Then take them off and paint and help your folks with the repairs after aunt and uncle leave, because you know the rest of the house will be trashed. That will be the greatest respect you could show your parents- that you supported them as people in a difficult situation.", "NTA.

Someone had to say it and you were the only one with balls enough to do it.\n\nGive her a bill for your new pajamas since she helped herself to them.

Your uncle ditched his kids somewhere for his wife? Who exactly is related to your dad? If this is your dad's brother's wife at your house, I think you are under reacting.

You could also take all the trash your aunt leaves lying around and throw it in her room.", "NTA Kick them out!", "NTA lock your room, and tell her not to touch your stuff or you will go through hers. Embarrass her at every opportunity. Tell your Dad to be a man and look after his wife and child not put his sister first. Your mom should refuse to cook for her.

Is your uncle not able to help out?", "You need to start saying a big fat NO.", "NTA- this is so fucking infuriating, i absolutely hate people like this who doesn't care about anyone's privacy and touch others things.

Brilliant!

One thing to stay a week, get over jet lag & visit before going site seeing, visiting others \u2026 but why pay the airfare to just sit in someone else\u2019s house? That just all sorts of crazy & stupid.", "Uh - when he has the time? Is there a time when he doesn\u2019t have the time? Does he clean the dishes when he\u2019s done?", "NTA but you need to lock your room. And your mom needs to stop cleaning so much. They're dad's guests so he can clean after them.", "Omg NTA you parents have no back bone so you had to. I have been there", "NTA. She is a leech and a thief. Definitely time to start locking your room while she's staying. Also what stress does she have working 3h/week that she needs 3 months off to decompress from it?", "OP is definitely right. If I were her I would have told them to pack and get out!!!!", "NTA, not at all. What a despicable woman, lock your door from now on and at every opportunity you get, make her uncomfortable enough to want to leave.", "Boss move. I'm missing the part of how she reacted and if she showed any shame? NTA.", "NTA! But they are\u2026 and how!", "If they want a vacation in another country... you should be charging them a standard B&B rate, since that is what they are treating your house like!  \n\nNTA - good on you for calling them out on their sh*t behaviour."]}
