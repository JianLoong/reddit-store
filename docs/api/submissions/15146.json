I am also not allowing my child to see one of his two grandmothers, who he loves to see. It follows logically that if I\u2019m not my mother\u2019s son, then my child isn\u2019t her grandson.

That's rather curious.\n\nYour mother's reaction is a little beyond rather curious. Have you spoken with other siblings or relatives to see if your mother is doing okay? Is this behavior unusual for her? If so, you and your family members may consider consulting an attorney or staging an intervention. She may be unwell.

Like that seems odd af for her to get mad about when it comes to you, when your own son has that as his legal last name.\n\nAlso as someone else pointed out you should probably check in with other relatives/family friends about her behavior and actions as of late because if this is completely out of the blue it may be a sign that something is wrong.", "NTA.

If all of the toxicity can end in this generation, then so be it. It\u2019s more important for a child to grow up in a healthy, loving, nurturing environment in a smaller family dynamic then to have family members who are very toxic and teaching them all the wrong things.", "NTA fuck that", "Is your mother Mallory Archer?", "Your mom always been like this?\n\nIs this new?\n\nIf not, setting and keeping firm boundaries quietly without drama on your side is probably your best bet. \n\nIf so, you need to push your mom to see a doc. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your child is yours. Why would someone get to treat you like shit and then expect an independent relationship with your child who is not a teenager, but a 2-year old baby? Part of your job is to foster relationships between your child and positive adults while also protecting them from those who are not going to be a positive influence or presence. Grandma needs to apologize and make progress in being less toxic to deserve another chance", "NTA\n\nBut hopefully you guys can sort things out to some degree in the near future.
