Yes, they're dicks for using the wrong names, but why is everyone so petty? Why does everything have to end in a total breakdown of a relationship? Does no one have any conflict resolution beyond escalation? It's an absolutely insane reason to destroy a relationship, so your parents have pet names for you kids you don't like, how is this the end of the world.\n\nI don't know, they really should make an effort to use the right names, even though you clearly chose them because you wanted them to be difficult and are going to spend the rest of their lives getting into arguments about it. But I just don't understand the mentality - most people WANT their kids to have grandparents. This isn't a medieval honour culture where every perceived slight has to be instantly avenged with a duel.\n\nGenuinely, do you think 'kids have no contact with grandparents' is better than 'kids get called an annoying nickname by grandparents.'

The first time I read some of the more traditional names (including Caoimhe), I wasn't sure how to pronounce them at first glance... so I would check online or ask a friend. It's reasonable to be initially unsure but it doesn't take a lot of effort to learn how to spell or pronounce someone's name, and it especially helps if you know someone with that name IRL if the name is new to you. It also shouldn't take years of correction when you're directly related to or spending a lot of time with someone to get it to stick. \n\nI fail to see how her grandparents continuing to \"forget\" how your childrens names are prounced is anything other than them being intentionally difficult and frankly very dismissive of their grandkids' Irish heritage. It would be difficult for me to want to bring children around people who continuously disrespect their names, seemingly intentionally at this point, regardless of whether they're family.

He loves them and doesn't need to know what assholes they are.\n\nI feel like the same goes for your situation.

You might wanna try that too.", "Most people who want to reflect their kids' cultures try to choose names that are dual-cultural, so people with Arabic heritage might choose Sara or Leila which have resonance in both cultures. 'Caoimhe' is pretty much the classic fuck-you name for Americans who want to be really, really difficult about their Irish heritage. But anyway, it's their right, it's a perfectly normal name in Ireland, but they obviously knew what they were doing.\n\nThe grandparents hate that their kids got weird names for the cultural context they'll grow up in.

As for american names.. well, real american names are the names of native people, seeing as they are the real americans.", "NTA - I thought Americans went nuts for having Irish connections, here they have family members with genuine Irish blood and a real assimilation of the cultures, not some great great grandparent who once spent a weekend in Cork and suddenly all their descendents are \"Irish-American\".\n\nIt is your parents who are weaponising the children with the denying family nonsense.
