I am only conflicted now because telling them this has led to more resistance and anger. It feels like I might have been better off not telling them, letting them figure it out, and like maybe I was holding something over their heads instead of just leaving things as they have become. Does it feel like an ultimatum?

I will give them that Caelan is a difficult one because even if you know the 'rules' of Irish names it doesn't really follow them. This is bigger than the name though.

It sounds like you need to have a conversation with your parents. I\u2019d hope that once they understand that they need to respect your kids\u2019 Irish heritage, at the very least as far as consistently saying their names properly, they\u2019ll adjust. It\u2019s a difficult conversation to have without being directly confrontational, but it\u2019s certainly not an unreasonable boundary to set.", "ESH. Yes, they're dicks for using the wrong names, but why is everyone so petty? Why does everything have to end in a total breakdown of a relationship? Does no one have any conflict resolution beyond escalation? It's an absolutely insane reason to destroy a relationship, so your parents have pet names for you kids you don't like, how is this the end of the world.\n\nI don't know, they really should make an effort to use the right names, even though you clearly chose them because you wanted them to be difficult and are going to spend the rest of their lives getting into arguments about it. But I just don't understand the mentality - most people WANT their kids to have grandparents. This isn't a medieval honour culture where every perceived slight has to be instantly avenged with a duel.\n\nGenuinely, do you think 'kids have no contact with grandparents' is better than 'kids get called an annoying nickname by grandparents.' If you do, well, then you almost certainly would have found some other reason to cut them out.", "NTA - and oh my goodness I can\u2019t believe after several years (I\u2019m assuming with three kids\u2026) they haven\u2019t let up! You haven\u2019t done anything wrong, basically said either respect me and my children or don\u2019t see them. Perfectly fair. If they want to be in their lives all they need to do is call them by their name. Simple!\n\nI think it\u2019s awesome that you\u2019ve embraced your wife\u2019s culture to continue that into the next generation.", "NTA by a long shot. I moved to Ireland from Canada a while back. The first time I read some of the more traditional names (including Caoimhe), I wasn't sure how to pronounce them at first glance... so I would check online or ask a friend. It's reasonable to be initially unsure but it doesn't take a lot of effort to learn how to spell or pronounce someone's name, and it especially helps if you know someone with that name IRL if the name is new to you. It also shouldn't take years of correction when you're directly related to or spending a lot of time with someone to get it to stick. \n\nI fail to see how her grandparents continuing to \"forget\" how your childrens names are prounced is anything other than them being intentionally difficult and frankly very dismissive of their grandkids' Irish heritage. It would be difficult for me to want to bring children around people who continuously disrespect their names, seemingly intentionally at this point, regardless of whether they're family. They created this issue with their A H behaviour. If they want to be involved with their grankids they could try treating them with respect.", "NTA", "Not really an AH but, they're going to have to spell and pronounce their names for people for rest of their lives. You certainly didn't make it easy for them", "They need to start saying the names properly.  It should not be a big deal and they are digging in on something that doesn't matter.  They are adults they should understand that.\n\nAt the same time, they are old and set in their ways and you can't change people, just be the change you want to see.  \n\nI personally have a very rocky relationship with my parents and it often causes me heartache to be around them, but I've stopped myself from cutting them off because of my son.  He loves them and doesn't need to know what assholes they are.\n\nI feel like the same goes for your situation.  Just let them be their grandparents, you don't have to like what they are doing, but it's a valuable gift to your kids to have that relationship.   Don't be petty, rise above how your parents are acting.\n\nESH.", "Then there's this guy\n\nSure like to see the grands try this on him lol...", "I knew a Caoimhe and she pronounced it Key-Vah", "Sometimes Caoimhe is pronounced differently in different areas. Paintball is right but also Kwee-vah. Then it's Kee-lan and Keen.", ">do you think 'kids have no contact with grandparents' is better than 'kids get called an annoying nickname by grandparents.'\n\nIt's better than grandparents call them wrong names on purpose to show disrespect for their culture. \n\n>you clearly chose them because you wanted them to be difficult and are going to spend the rest of their lives getting into arguments about it.\n\n Or maybe because the names are part of their heritage, being irish. \n\n>so your parents have pet names for you kids you don't like, how is this the end of the world.\n\nDid you even read the post?? They refuse to say their names because they hate that the kids have names that reflect their mother's heritage.", "Just because you are a doormat doesn't mean everyone else has to be. In case you didn't read the post, the grandparents disrespect the children. They say their names wrong on purpose to show how much they disagree with their names. How is a \"valuable gift\" to have grandma misspelling your name constantly just because she hates a part of you?? This isn't about OP being petty, this is OP defending his children. You might wanna try that too.", "Most people who want to reflect their kids' cultures try to choose names that are dual-cultural, so people with Arabic heritage might choose Sara or Leila which have resonance in both cultures. 'Caoimhe' is pretty much the classic fuck-you name for Americans who want to be really, really difficult about their Irish heritage. But anyway, it's their right, it's a perfectly normal name in Ireland, but they obviously knew what they were doing.\n\nThe grandparents hate that their kids got weird names for the cultural context they'll grow up in. This is pretty dickish, as I said. But this whole idea that every hint of disrespect needs to lead to massive escalation and instant throwing of ultimatums everywhere is both insane and emotionally unhealthy.", "And not learning your grandchildren name is the same level of \"insane and emotionally unhealthy\". And whose to say op and his wife won't move to ireland? As for american names.. well, real american names are the names of native people, seeing as they are the real americans."]}
