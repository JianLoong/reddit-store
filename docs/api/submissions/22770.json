You don't need an undisciplined teenager wrecking things in your home.\n\nThis girl obviously has problems. One of them is the lack of parenting by an AH mother in a state of total denial.", "NTA. You have a right to ban anyone from your house for any reason, and expensive property damage, even if accidental, is an extremely valid reason. I'd say if sister wants Hayley to be allowed at your house, she has to replace the TV at the very least.", "NTA. It is your house, and there is a fine line that family can cross before you say enough is enough. She damaged property in your house, and it doesn't sound like there was any form of apology. Was there? She just nonchalantly put the bat down, and I assume she went about her business. Then, did the mom even offer to clean the mess and replace the TV? Or did she just say kids are kids?\n\nMaking the statement about her school behavior could make you sound like an AH and should have been left out of the conversation. You should have made the conversation about what you have witnessed and how it has impacted you. You and your sister need to set ground rules for appropriate behavior in your house. Once that is established, allow her back in your home as long as she follows them.", "NTA \n\nHayley is not a child, she is a teenager and teenagers are expected to behave like adults do. Letting her get away with behavior like that will only hurt hayley in the long run, I know I had a cousin with authority defiance disorder, and adhd, trust me no one not even her mother wants to be around her now. She is an adult with a criminal record, several broken unhealthy relationships, and several miscarriages because unfortunately she inherited our families hormone imbalances. And to be fair I judge her for sleeping around outside of marriage and getting pregnant in the first place. And while she was doing things she shouldn't have been doing as a pregant person. our family is \"cursed\" with hormone related issues that make conceiving and carrying a baby harder to do. \n\nSorry for the tangent hayley is 13 not 10 and she should be forced to act like a 13 yo not a 10 yo. That behavior she displayed at the bbq was unacceptable for a 6 yo much less a 13 yo.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas your sister offered to pay for the TV?", "Ban both your sister and niece from the house.", "NTA Hopefully, Hayley was fine. But she's way too old to behave like that, especially as a guest in her Aunts home. As she doesn't seem to have much self-control, I wouldn't blame you at all for banning her from your home.", "NTA. And you would be NTA to demand they replace your TV.", "NTA for keeping her out of your home. However her parenting is none of your business", "NTA for banning her, but you are an asshole for sticking your nose in other parents issues. As a kid who was literally and regularly suspended for being ambushed and attacked at my school (anyone involved in a fight got suspended), and who suffered extreme depression and bad grades for that treatment, I can tell you personally that it is feasible she is being targeted at school.", "It\u2019s your house you can do what you want in it however.... what\u2019s your goal for \u201cbanning\u201d only your niece.
