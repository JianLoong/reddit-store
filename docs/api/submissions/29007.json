I\u2019m currently 33 weeks pregnant and his mother who lives in New York offered to throw us a baby shower in NY where they\u2019re from and we agreed to it. My boyfriend and I live in Texas. The shower was yesterday (Saturday) and they invited about 100 people, they have a really big family. \n\nThe shower was going alright until he got on his knees and proposed. I was so shocked, but happily said yes and everybody clapped and the night went normal after that. Personally I was upset because the proposal didn\u2019t include not one friend or family of mine, I was surrounded by people I barely knew. It felt so selfish because he made the whole proposal about himself and didn\u2019t think about what I would want. I told him before if you\u2019re going to propose, tell my best friends so they can help you plan it. He took that happy moment away from me and I will never be able to get it back. \n\nThat night after the shower, I mentioned it to him and he got upset. Said I was an asshole and basically ungrateful after everything he and his mom did for me. I didn\u2019t say too much else but I\u2019m still upset. So I\u2019m I wrong here for feeling the way I do?\n\nEdit : My family and friends weren\u2019t invited because I plan on having another baby shower in Texas with my people. Plus nobody would want to fly to New York even if they were invited.", "created_utc": 1697425560, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178wct7/aita_for_being_upset_because_my_boyfriend/", "score": 377, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Shouldn't it be 2 people where and whenever it happens.? \n\nDo you want an actual marriage or do you want all the show  which now apparently spreads the actual proposal,  parties,  weekends away and big wedding.", "'After everything he and his mother did for YOU'. Was this an OP Shower? An 'Anonymous Shower'? I've gotta clean off my granny glasses, I thought is was a BABY SHOWER. \nYa know for the child they created together. \nMy bad!", "NTA. It sounds like a lame proposal, but having your friends help plan it, and to be there is also lame. Since when did proposing become a spectator sport? I'd be more pissed it wasn't in a romantic way.", "He sprung this question on you in front of all his important people.. some of whom were absolute strangers to you. You were mature and waited until after the baby shower to talk to him privately. He called you an asshole because you expressed to him you were upset you didn\u2019t have any of your close friends or family members alongside his loved ones?? \n\nWow. \nThat is so hurtful.\n\nThink long and hard if he\u2019s the right person for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA, not sure how you told him but him calling you an ungrateful asshole is way too much. He could\u2019ve planned something small and private if he really took your considerations to mind. My fianc\u00e9 always asked me about what I would like, what scenarios, what I would NOT like etc. \nYour man sounds like he doesn\u2019t really give two fucks about your opinion. Has he always been verbally abusive or has this just started?", "NTA. You told him point blank that you wanted your friends to be included on any proposal. Instead he did it at a party his mom threw you, so it seems like he put minimal effort in the proposal.", "NTA. Idk what the hell is up with the comments tonight. Why wouldn\u2019t you want this special moment with your family instead of all the people you don\u2019t know? And what\u2019s wrong with saying how you would want to be proposed to? Aren\u2019t people supposed to communicate about this kind of stuff? If you couldn\u2019t get all the family in one place, why not a romantic private moment? My god.", "For all those that said it would have been the same in reverse if he did it at home - no, they live there, so he would have had his friends there at least.\n\nPersonally, I don't think that would have been great either, but if that was really the kind of proposal he wanted, he should have done it at the other shower or organize at least your closest family to be there.\n\nI don't think you should have expected him to consult your best friend or propose specifically how you want, but at least some consideration should have been made to your feelings.\n\nAlso, I am taking what you said at face value. That you accepted happily, didn't make a big deal of it at the shower, and told him in private about your feelings without blowing up at him.\n\nIf so, I am a little worried about his reaction. Were you just supposed to pretend you loved the proposal without communicating anything to him? He could just have said he was disappointed you felt that way and didn't realize it that it would upset you. Then you both move on.\n\nHe says his mother did so much for you - was that just the baby shower because if so, she did it for him. In fact, he got Mommy to throw his proposal for him. Is this a trend in your relationship, or was he just overwhelmed and is acting out of character?", "NTA. Completely thoughtless proposal on his end. I cannot believe these comments are advocating for you to settle for a proposal that not a single one of your own friends or family were at.", "NTA. You and him had already communicated about what an ideal proposal would be and then he didn\u2019t take that into consideration at all. \n\nNot sure where all the YTA comments are coming from? Relationships are about communicating with your partner and listening to each other, and it\u2019s clear he didn\u2019t do that. I think that\u2019s probably what hurts OP even more than the actual proposal.", "Maybe it's just me, but I feel like someone disregarding the wishes of the person they're proposing to - when those things have been discussed - is just a sign of how they will be concerning and future wants/needs of the person they're proposing to.", "It seems like he took the easy way out and put no work into it. It\u2019s like proposing at a wedding.\n\nI would be really thinking about his statement about all that he and his mom did for you. So a grandma threw a baby shower who cares!!!\n\nYou need to have another conversation and make sure this isn\u2019t going to be one sided. Meaning that your feelings don\u2019t matter.", "NTA\n\nI was originally going to say ETA, but after some introspection, I completely see your side.\n\nIt is unfair that only his side of family got to be involved in the celebration. I\u2019m sure it was quite uncomfortable for you at the party to be congratulated by strangers, when it probably would\u2019ve been more meaningful if you had your family/friends there as well. \n\nEven if your family and friends couldn\u2019t make it to NY, he could\u2019ve gotten them on Zoom or Facetime. So that\u2019s on your boyfriend. \n\nOther people are saying you\u2019re ungrateful, and to be honest, I thought the same thing originally. However, I think it\u2019s valid to want to be in the company of people you\u2019re close with after a big milestone. You didn\u2019t get that opportunity, but he did!", "NTA. How a proposal is done shouldn\u2019t matter that much. It\u2019s also his proposal so he should consider himself aswell. However, he only cared about his loved ones being there and witnessing it, and didn\u2019t care about your loved ones at all, so it\u2019s fair that it seems selfish and inconsiderate because he made it about him and his family and making it a spectacle in front of them only.", "NTA. It\u2019s clear that he didn\u2019t think about you at all when he planned this proposal. He just wanted to show off for his friends and family and couldn\u2019t care less that none of your friends or family were there to witness it. Then he doubles down when you express your feelings to him by calling you names and saying you were ungrateful? I\u2019d think twice about deciding to marry this guy.", "Isn\u2019t the point of a proposal to cater it to the person being asked not the one asking? I would want it to be special for THEM", "My spider sense says his mother wanted this.", "Nta- his mum proposed and paid. Lucky girl.", "I\u2019m weirded out by the people saying YTA because they seem to think you should just be grateful he proposed at all. Seems like a glaring lack of standards for a relationship. \n\nI think the fact that he failed to take what you want into consideration, even after you insisted that he should, is less than ideal behavior. \n\nNTA. You made what you wanted clear, he ignored that, you have a right to be upset that he didn\u2019t listen to you.", "Why wasn\u2019t it just between the two of them? NTA", "NTA\n\nA proposal should be special for the woman and tailored to her style. Hope the ring was huge at least :P \n\nIf it makes you feel any better I got proposed to at Swiss Chalet over my lunch-hour. Not a story I enjoyed telling lol", "NTA. Let's take the event out of the equation. You clearly communicated your desires. He didn't listen and did something else, the opposite in fact. You again communicated your disappoinment. And then he calls you ungrateful. Wtf? You did your part to prevent being ungrateful. He didn't do his part.\n\nBringing back to the event. I personally don't like the idea of squishing all major life events into one. A proposal and a baby shower on the same day sucks. And yes, you deserve your family and friends around to cry and celebrate, not strangers. He can't understand that?\n\nI don't think women should be grateful when they're desires are not met. And I don't think women should be grateful when they aren't heard. And I don't think women should be grateful when he milestones are minimized and disregarded.", "NTA. Proposals like that are tacky, especially if you\u2019ve expressed to him in the past to run any ideas past your friends", "Personally I share the view of others here that proposals should be an intimate moment between two people and not a performance. However, the pair of you clearly don't hold those beliefs. Given you had communicated what you wanted, him specifically going against your wishes in such a directly selfish way means NTA.", "NTA\n\nHis proposal was lazy and thoughtless. I would be upset, too.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of his when and where, it\u2019s just the fact that you clearly communicated what you want and he ignored it.\n\nI would have been petrified if my husband ignored my request for his proposal to be private.\n\nThat being said, there was little chance of him responding any way but defensively unless you give him a bit of an out when communicating your disappointment with him.", "Personally, I would say you are NTA. First, it might also be the hormones of the pregnancy making you feel a little more sensitive and emotional, but that doesn't change the fact that your boyfriend... or now fiance, is a completely inconsiderate asshole. Like calling you ungrateful is such a low blow when you are already down. You're caring his baby for goodness sake! It does sound like he's a little manipulative in a way.\n\nDid he even got the proposal on camera? I hope so, at least it's something you can play at the baby shower with your own family. I hope you and your baby stay safe!", "YTA. You lost me you said you told him to tell your friends so they could help him stage it.  It\u2019s a proposal, not a one act play. Your baby\u2019s gender reveal is probably gonna be another dog and pony show.", "Info why was none of your family/friends there? Were they invited?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe way he went about it was performative, selfish, and inconsiderate. His reaction just reinforces that. If she expressed a preference, a compromise could have been made.", "I don't like when a guy propose on a occasion that is for something or someone else. I fell like he wants to get attention or get accepted. If you don't you become a bad guy. Its a complete selfish move. It should be just two people or atleast not infront of too many people . Anyways if you love him nothing else matters. Unfortunately it won't be a long lasting happy marriage.", ">He took that happy moment away from me and I will never be able to get it back.\n\nWhat happy moment? The moment when the man you love asks you to spend the rest of your life with him? \n\nOr is it more important being fawned on and congratulated by your friends/family? Surely you can have some kind of do if you want to celebrate it. Life is too short to be so precious about something like this.  \n\nYTA", "Whatever happened to a proposal being a lovely, special moment when  two people in love decide to spend their lives together? I hate how much of a production it's become and how important the setting and other superficial elements are.", "NTA. Tbh, I\u2019m so confused on why people are so shocked at the idea of a group seeing your proposal. I think it\u2019s sweet; people you love get to see you become a fianc\u00e9(e), you get to celebrate right after it happens when the dust is still settling and your hands are still shaking, you could even get a video of it happening so you can watch that moment decades later with no bad memory playing tricks on you. If you don\u2019t get embarrassed easily, or you tell your family + friends everything anyways, what\u2019s the harm in wanting them to be present for it? Honestly, I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s any different from a wedding. Why not just get married in a courthouse, or in a church with no guests so you can have a private moment ? Why let other people see that? \nSometimes it\u2019s just nice to experience things with an entire group\u2019s worth of love surrounding you. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA, not bc I think you wanted a production but bc it sounds like it was low key uncomfortable and more about what he wanted. You probably dropped some hints here and there that he likely ignored. My husband and I didn\u2019t discuss the ring or the proposal too much but he remembered a couple things I mentioned eons ago and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. Seems like he should have known you wouldn\u2019t want a spectacle in front of complete strangers", "Nta. My husband spontaneously proposed without a ring lol. Driving home from the big city (like an hour or so) & he said the thought just came to his head & he HAD to ask me right then. I said yes. 4 years & 1 beautiful baby boy later I'm so happy. \nWe also got married just the 2 of us, an amateur photographer, the officiant & 2 witnesses.\nIt was a perfect day. We went & got 5guys & hangout at home all night celebrating just us. If I ever got remarried I'd do it the same way. I dunno why it has to be some big spectacle.", "ESH,\n\nHe sucks for doing it like performativly and for himself, rather than sometime nice and considerate. You suck for wanting it done a certain way too. But I think he is more the A-hole here, you're pregnant, he should know better.", "Info- would you have been upset if he proposed at the baby shower with your friends and family?  If not why is okay to do it in front of your family and not his? Are his not important enough to share in the joy? I don\u2019t think either shower was a great idea but I don\u2019t think he had bad intentions. Nah", "Soft YTA\n\nI think he is right and you're being kind of selfish. He and his mother threw you a party and he used it as an opportunity to propose. He felt comfortable proposing to you. That should be the most important part. \n\nIt's his proposal too. He may be asking you to marry him, but it's not all about you. \n\nFWIW, most engagements are not these Instagram-worthy events. Your expectations may be too high.", "NTA", "Honestly, shocking the number of people saying that you should just be grateful with however the guy decides to propose. \n\nIMHO a partner that actually cared about you would have a fair idea of what you liked and how to go about proposing. Some people like big romantic gestures, some people like private secluded ones. It's up to the partner to understand and plan a proposal accordingly.\n\nOP's boyfriend dropped the ball completely. It sounds like he didn't even try to consider what would have made the occasion special to you and instead did what he wanted. I'd personally be having second thoughts, especially with how he reacted after you tried telling him your feelings.\n\nNTA, and I wish you the best of luck moving forward.", "YTA. \n\nfrom a married man\u2019a perspective:\n\nThe proposal or engagement is the sole burden on the man. Since the man asks the question. He ultimately responsible on the planning budgeting at execution of said proposal. \n\nNow do not mistake it for the wedding itself as that is a totally different beast. A wedding is a one day affair where the bride and groom exchange vows. It\u2019s the first official activity they plan and execute as a couple. Its a shared responsibility of both bride and groom to plan and execute a wedding. Basically the roles are, the bride maps out the wedding and the grooms says yes to what the bride wants.", "I absolutely love being told I'm ungrateful for not appreciating something I didn't want. Is this your first big fight? Or is it always his go-to move to accuse you of being ungrateful when you express an opinion? \n\nHow much of your life revolves around his mom? He seems awfully concerned with you showing gratitude to his mother for everything she has \"done for you.\" What exactly has she done for you? Because if the answer is throwing a baby shower, I personally don't think that means you have to plan your life events around her. And it's concerning that he thinks you should.\n\nI'd watch out how much he defers to his mom in the planning stages for the wedding. But even more importantly, does he defer to her wishes over yours when it comes to making plans for the baby. Consider if you want his mom running your life as well as his.\n\nNTA", "NTA! So confused by all of these aggressive AH votes. JFC if you all want a simple proposal then get yourselves a simple proposal but grand gesture proposals aren\u2019t some new concept and I don\u2019t understand why everyone is acting so superior at the mere suggestion that someone might want a little bit more than the minimum. Everyone is different. \n\nAnd what\u2019s wild is that OP never even stated she wanted some crazy big proposal! People just decided she did and then pulled out their holier than thou pitch forks. All I saw her say was that she wanted her BF to involve her friends in the planning and it doesn\u2019t sound like he did that at all. I don\u2019t understand why her expecting him to think about her feelings with regard to this proposal is so offensive to some of you. Yes, it\u2019s both of their proposal, but literally no part of this proposal took her into consideration. It was all about the BF\u2019s convenience.  Honestly, it just sounds like he was lazy and piggy backed on the baby shower FMIL threw for them. OP can be grateful for the baby shower and still be disappointed with the proposal. \n \nAnd, for the record, my husband proposed to me in a very thoughtful, simple, and private manner which perfectly suited us and our relationship. It\u2019s ok for anyone to want something different for themselves though.", "If he has a pattern of not considering you when making decisions, that\u2019s something you need to resolve before getting married. If he is typically a thoughtful, considerate partner and this proposal is a stand alone incident, then give him the benefit of the doubt.", "I have a problem with the comment \"after all that he and his mother did for her\". \nIs she not pregnant with HIS baby? Does the shower put on by HIS mother not provide gifts for HIS baby? \nHow was this for \"her\"? \nShe had to be there. She's the incubator. \nAnyway, I think ESH. Putting so much importance on the proposal is frivolous, but the fact he made it so \"him\" centric was thoughtless. \nOP, If you love him, let it go. Your relationship is so much more than a disappointing proposal.", "YTA.", "YTA. Maybe it\u2019s not how it should be but it\u2019s how it is. The proposal is the guys moment and the wedding is a woman\u2019s moment.

You sound like a nightmare.", "Yta and entitled.", "YTA", "Put it all down to your hormones. Personally, I would have preferred NOBODY else be there but the two of us. A marriage is not a group event, neither should a proposal be. The group event is family and friends from both sides at the wedding. I am very grateful my husband proposed to me in the moment, with nobody else there.", "NTA because your feelings is your feelings. But let's be honest. \nWho the hell cares about, who's there to witness your proposal. It's about you and him. Nothing else. \nAnd if you'd be the last people on earth ... People do really value the attention more than the actual act of marrying these days.", "YTA and you are ungrateful.

Good luck.", "ESH\u2026 Him because if you are going to involve people in a proposal (which I personally think is weird), it should be a group of people that represents both sides.

I was so shocked, but happily said yes and everybody clapped and the night went normal after that. Personally I was upset because the proposal didn\u2019t include not one friend or family of mine, I was surrounded by people I barely knew. It felt so selfish because he made the whole proposal about himself and didn\u2019t think about what I would want. I told him before if you\u2019re going to propose, tell my best friends so they can help you plan it. He took that happy moment away from me and I will never be able to get it back. \n\nThat night after the shower, I mentioned it to him and he got upset.

He sucks for doing a big public thing with just his family and not thinking about telling any of yours or considering how you would feel. You suck though as well for trying to micromanage how he proposes. My only thing I didn\u2019t want in a proposal was a public one. I made my husband aware of that as soon as we even started talking about the idea of marriage. Btw, today I have been married 3 years. Wanna know how my husband proposed? We were doing a carriage ride through the Christmas lights on the beach, he planned to pull the ring out in a place no one was near but he couldn\u2019t get it from the car since I was with him. So instead, he proposed to me in his car in the parking lot of Longhorns before we went to dinner. Also, guess what? I was thrilled because I wanted to marry this man. I love this man to death and no matter where he asked me, nothing would change that. I said yes immediately, we kissed, cried, and called our families and then had a bomb ass dinner. That\u2019s real life. If this is such a hang up you might not be ready for marriage.", "NTA, but This is not something you should be offended at. Unless this is more important to you than anything else, pick your battles wisely.", "YTA boyfriend should take the ring back and find someone with less baggage!", "NAH\n\nI\u2019ve been there. My husband proposed when I was pregnant, and it was in the middle of a big going away party with his friends before we moved. I was miserable from morning sickness, we hadn\u2019t told anyone I was pregnant so I had to be secretly sober, and I was miserable staying up late. When he asked, we were walking, and I just said, yeah, of course, because I didn\u2019t think he was proposing. He stopped and said it more seriously. I wanted to marry him, so I said yes, but I didn\u2019t expect a proposal like that. He didn\u2019t even have the ring (he found a ring as a teenager and kept it to propose to the right woman). We always talked about taking a romantic trip to the beach because that\u2019s where we first said we loved each other. It was terrible timing with pregnancy hormones and the morning sickness. I also hate being in the spotlight so being freshly engaged in front of dozens of his friends was the complete opposite of a good time. He also continued to hang out with them, partying their faces off, and I barely saw him, and we spent the night at my mom\u2019s place. I was really upset for many years.\n\nWe\u2019re coming up on our 9 year anniversary and I\u2019m at peace with it. He\u2019s not a grand-romantic-gestures kinda guy, he doesn\u2019t plan our trips or my birthday, etc. But he\u2019s the sweetest guy every single day. If he\u2019s grumpy and says anything slightly mean, he apologizes, and most of the time I haven\u2019t even noticed because it\u2019s so mild. I wanted to marry him then, and I\u2019m still thrilled to be with him. He\u2019s a better partner than me. He always supports me and does anything I ask, even after a long day of work. He inspires me to be better, and I\u2019ve grown so much because of him.\n\nWe want to think that love is this magical thing, but it\u2019s a choice. The magic is two people making the choice to be together every day for the rest of their lives. Making the choice to always be kind to the other person. When they aren\u2019t being a good partner, looking for what\u2019s stressing them out and supporting them while they work through it. Cricism of who they are usually makes them feel worse and less likely to have the energy to tackle the problem. You will never regret true kindness and generosity.\n\nOnly you know if you can make the choice to be kind to him every day and if he\u2019s the one you want to always come home to. He made a mistake, but you can choose to work together to have good days from now on, no matter what mistakes get made. It\u2019s a lot while pregnant, but my husband and I have been through some extremely hard times. We have 3 kids and are 2000 miles from our families. Whether or not you choose to marry your boyfriend, you will be tied to him. No matter what he does as a partner or parent, being kind to him will mean an enjoyable relationship.", "Sounds like y\u2019all need to learn to communicate.

If you haven\u2019t had a conversation about what you want, you can\u2019t blame him for not living up to your expectations.

OP, you honestly seem too immature for marriage right now. You need counseling because you're concerned about the wrong thing.

Over 50% of marriages in the US end in divorce, so it's likely you won't beat the odds. Stop focusing on drivel and learn that certain things may not fit into your idea of what you would call \"perfect\", but you should still be grateful for them. Your response to your partner is a HUGE red flag and, unfortunately, he already knocked you up, so he can't cut and run. Learn that everything is not about you and stop creating chaos where there is none. Now, go apologize to your man, tell him you love him and work on fostering a spirit of gratitude for the things you have. Things will not always be perfect! Focus on the end result instead of getting caught up in the grand gestures.

Let's get it over with and get married\" \ud83e\udd23 my response was \"how romantic. Exactly how every woman wishes to be proposed to\" and laughed at him (I was being sarcastic and he knew it). But we planned on eloping anyway, so he didn't figure we needed any actual engagement \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Our elopement ended up turning into a small backyard wedding which was actually one of the best days of my life surrounded by most of our closest family and friends (we didn't give people much notice so some of my immediate family couldn't attend, but I asked someone to take video so I could send it to them and they could still witness the ceremony). \n\nWhat actually matters is the marriage/union itself. If you can afford to have your dream wedding, then it doesn't matter how he proposed or where. And in 5-10-50 years from now, it won't matter where and when and how he proposed.\n\nThough, I do find his reaction was to be angry and call you an AH and whatever else when you tried to tell him your feelings and why you felt that way to be a bit alarming and concerning. But my advice would be to wait til you've both had some time to calm down and try to discuss it further when you can both discuss it calmly.

It did not become THEIR engagement until she says yes. Okay...\nWhat person plans their own proposal?  Lol...very controlling and she needs to get over it before he calls it off.", "Especially since she said that she wanted a romantic private one but he ignored that and it was one that included only his family on top of that", "So the fact that she\u2019s upset means that she\u2019s immature and not ready to be a mother? That statement in its own is extremely immature. Yes it\u2019s up to the person doing the asking however if they\u2019ve had an open discussion about marriage and proposal and she made it known that all she wants is her friends or family involved or at least apart of it that\u2019s another story.", "Lol.\n\nPretty sure I\u2019m older than you, for the record. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of ridiculous and materialistic to shove aside her concerns over the manner in which he proposed because PRESENTS!!1! \n\nLike, I\u2019m an extrovert and I\u2019d be completely overwhelmed at 100 people I didn\u2019t know well as a \u201cparty\u201d for me. Where I then have to arrange to get 100 gifts back several hundred miles. I\u2019d feel like I was on display at a zoo and not actually all that important. If I got proposed to at an event like that? I\u2019d be upset. I hate public proposals.", "I'm going to bed, but you are putting your own spin on this, as I am. Agree to disagree.\n\nAnd SIGH right back at you. Passive aggressive bullshit like that will win you very few arguments.", "She said, \"If you're going to propose, tell my best friends, and they can help plan it.\"\n\nEvidently, he didn't want or need their help. He wanted to plan it, and that's his right. \n\nShe goes on to say, he took this happy moment from me that I can't get back. \n\nNo joy that she had 100 people to attend or in 30 days, she's giving life to a child, and her life will never be the same. She lived with him for four years already. \nYes, she is immature, selfish, and worried about the optics.", "This is what people say when they are proven wrong. Stop debating the issue and just say you learned something new today.  \n\nI'm not trying to win an argument.  Facts win every time. You are trying to win instead of seeking truth. \nGood nite.", "Yes it is his right but he is not the only one in the relationship. As a partner you should try to make it beautiful for both of you. It\u2019s not crazy that she\u2019d want the proposal to also cater to her as well. Like she said she didn\u2019t know most of those people and she was probably already awkward as it is catering to so many people you do and don\u2019t know. It\u2019s extremely overwhelming. Also it\u2019d be different if she made a big deal out of it at the party and was completely ungrateful but that\u2019s not the case. She appreciated the party and what they did and the support they\u2019re getting from everyone and said nothing until they were alone. Also she\u2019s becoming a mother but she is still a human. You keep implying that she\u2019s unready or too immature but just because she\u2019s having a baby does not mean she doesn\u2019t have the right to be upset if he knew she at least wanted them apart of it. He didn\u2019t have to include them in planning but he could\u2019ve at least done something where her family was also involved. Again a relationship and marriage is about union and two people not just appealing to one there absolutely could\u2019ve been a compromise that would make them both happy but he didn\u2019t care."]}
