I don't want to ever let my oldest brother (Dan) meet her. Dan is what the internet would call an edgelord. Except that he's 30 years old and not a teenager. Dan likes to say things that are hurtful or he knows will be controversial. He's been like this most of his life and never grew out of it. I don't know why he does it but he enjoys riling people up.\n\nDan has been fired from jobs over it. He's lost friends. He will go at people's race, religion, sexual orientation or anything else. Whether or not he actually believes these things he says them online and in real life. If you tell him to stop he just keeps going to get you upset. If you ignore him he keeps going. I don't talk to Dan unless I'm visiting my dad, who lives with him and even then I stick to light topics.\n\nMy girlfriend's family is not religious but she is culturally Jewish and her name reflects that. I don't want Dan anywhere around her. He will pick up that she's Jewish even if no one tells him. I do not want to subject my girlfriend to that. My dad and my stepmother say I can give Dan an ultimatum that if he says anything he's out. But ultimatums have never worked for Dan and I don't even want my girlfriend to hear it in the first place. I would be reluctant to introduce her no matter what because he would say things about women but her being Jewish adds an extra layer. I have talked to my girlfriend and she doesn't want to meet Dan. She and her family have had discrimination in the past and she doesn't want to deal with Dan trying to rile her up.\n\nAita here? My dad is pushing back on me saying Dan will never meet her. So is my other brother (Ray). Our family has known Ray's wife's family since we were kids so she knew about Dan long before Ray started dating her, and she had heard it all from him. He thinks I'm overreacting. Even Dan is pissed off at me about this. I don't care what Dan thinks. But my dad and Ray are on Dan's side and they say I can just tell him to leave or leave with my girlfriend when he says something but I don't want her to hear it. She doesn't deserve that.

If your dad wants to meet your gf, he can meet you somewhere neutral that doesn't include Dan. Expecting Dan to stay away if you go to his/your dad's home is too much and he'll take it as an invitation to double-down since he knows you're making an issue of it at this point. If Dan shows up anywhere while you're in town, I would recommend having a plan (and communicating it to your gf ahead of time) to get up and walk out no matter what else is going on.

People who behave like your brother don't belong in polite company.\n\nHowever, do you see this as a long term/lifetime relationship?  If so, you're going to need a more specific plan than \"I'm never letting my brother meet her.\"\n\nWill your parents and brother agree to never invite him to a family gathering, so the two of you can be there?  Will you boycott all family gatherings?  What will you do if they invite you, invite him, and don't tell you he's invited?  What will you do if he shows up at a family holiday or gathering uninvited?\n\nAre you going to give him the level of control of your life that lets him push you out of the family just by him showing up? \n\nWill your father and brother agree never to invite him, if you are invited? Will your mother have the willpower to oppose her husband and other son, and un-invite him if they invite him?\n\nThis is not a one-time decision.  And it may mean burning bridges with your entire family.\n\nThe problem is, everyone in your family is used to your brother's behavior.  And they're not used to anyone resisting him.  He may make a hobby of boat-rocking, but they'll see that as normal sailing, and blame you for rocking the boat.", "At last, a real man posts on this forum.", "NTA.

Are you just going to refuse to attend all family events forever because Dan is in attendance?", "NTA; and you're doing right by your gf. You told her what he's like and let her make a choice informed by your own experiences with your brother. You've attempted giving him chances in the past and he's squandered them.\n\nIf he wants to meet her so badly and be a participant in your life he needs to change and show it BEFORE he's given any kind of chance to be antisemitic to your girlfriend, and even then it would be valid if you& your gf didn't want her to meet him.\n\nYour dad and brother are enablers, they don't get to make others make the choices they have made for themselves", "NTA: if your brother and dad want to ignore the elephant in the room (Dan\u2019s blatant disrespect for others) then that\u2019s up to them. Your job is to protect your girlfriend and by ensuring she never meets you brother who is the a*hole in this situation that is exactly what your doing. If you can avoid his foolery altogether do it instead of allowing something unwarranted and unprovoked to happen. Dan honestly seems toxic and needs some help but he\u2019s grown and if he doesn\u2019t want to sort himself out at his age that\u2019s his business. Protect your girlfriend at all costs by setting as hard a boundary you need to with Dan. Your dad and brother definitely understand why you\u2019re doing it, chances are they\u2019re trying to keep the peace by encouraging them to meet, not realising they\u2019re actually enabling his behaviour, but again, that\u2019s up to them if they want to keep dealing with his foolery.", "NTA: \n\n\"Dad and Ray: I can appreciate you sticking up for Dan. Really, I do. But he's an ass, we all know it, please don't waste your breath denying it. If I bring my gf over when he is there, we all know that he will be rude to her, and then we will leave. Why o. eartg are you so i vested in creating a sitiation that will make myself and my gf unhappy and waste all our time?
