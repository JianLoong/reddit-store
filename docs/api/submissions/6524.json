But are you familiar with the saying **The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree?** \n\nWhile there are obvious exceptions, a lot of times a bully is a reflection of their parents.", "NTA but pls note that many bullies are themselves abused at home. There was a shitty little 1st grade classmate of my son who called him names, harassed him in the bathroom, etc. My first reaction was, FIRST GRADE?!?! this happens? Then I found out from a friend that the kid's parents were divorcing. \n\nI totally went to bat for my son, spoke to the teachers and principle. They intervened as possible, but I used this as an opportunity to explain the whole 'hurt people hurt people' thing.  \n\nIt's been a few years, and building up my son and then daughter's resilience to bullies was a gradual process... but just yesterday my 9 year old daughter was bullied at camp. She spoke to the teachers AND she confronted the mean girls! Apparently she stuck out her hand, and said, I'd like a truce. I don't like how you're talking to me, and you have to stop, but I'd like to be friends.\n\nThis is a great time to build self confidence and provide the tools to handle these sorts of conflicts. It's worth the effort to focus on how your child manages these situations, as we all know you can't control what other people do. \n\nEDIT to add advice I gave in a private chat\n\nMy foundation is of course building trust and confidence that I will: listen and tell the kids they're heard, offer reassurance and point out why the bullies are wrong about them, suggest how to react and actually practice potential reactions, and talk to whichever adult I need to ensure my kid knows I'm doing my best to protect them and get some action for the situation.\n\nI'm lucky that teachers etc have been responsive. I have and will include school counselors and the principal in these conversations. \n\nBuilding that trust tho... they never hesitate to tell me when something is wrong, and that's so key. Because how can you help if you don't know?!\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\nAnother little add on. I use the actual words, 'I hear you' with my kids. I saw that in a post somewhere, and saying those words make a difference.", "INFO: Was your tone sarcastic/confrontational when you approached the boy and his father? As in, was it obvious that you already knew the boy was the one bullying your daughter?\n\nIt's not uncommon that bullies come from broken/abusive homes and I wouldn't be surprised if this boy is one of them, based on the way his father reacted. I don't think you did anything wrong if your tone when you approached them wasn't sarcastic/aggressive/confrontational. Because I understand why you might 'play dumb' and not outwardly tell the father his son is bullying others until you can gauge what kind of parent he is. Clearly you were right to be careful, if that was your thinking.\n\nIf you were sarcastic or cynical, on the other hand, so it was obvious based on your tone that you already knew the boy was the bully -- you might be TA. Because you wouldn't have taken into consideration that it might endanger the boy to approach his father, that he may have picked up the anti-social behavior he exhibits in school from home. I don't think you had bad intentions -- you definitely weren't looking to endanger this kid -- but it's something to consider in the future. The boy might have looked as frightened as he did because of the way he anticipated his father would react and punish him. Just look at the way the father reacted to you, regardless of whether or not you were a bit sarcastic or immature.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying it's always wrong to approach the parents of your child's bully. Just make sure you have an idea of who you're talking to, because bringing such information to other parents only helps solve you/your child's cause as long as the parents can be trusted to act on it accordingly, responsibly and appropriately as parents.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the patent thought they were accomplishing - it seems clear to me they know their kid is a bully and an asshole. \n\nThat kid\u2019s lucky you were so mellow.

How did she feel after that interaction?", "You seem to think you were being subtle. You weren't. \n\nLets say that a random man comes up to your daughter in the middle of the street, basically ignores you and starts accusing her of bullying someone. They're pushy, they're tall and intimidating your terrified child (because stranger danger! Strange adult!)l; physically standing in front of the two of you and boy that sounds like using their size to block your daughter in.

If a kid is failing school, chances are his parents don\u2019t care and won\u2019t show up for parent-teachers.  And they never did.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't the arsehole, but I think there could be a different approach.\n\nLet's take my Dad and I for example. I was bashed at school, verbally abused etc. And *nothing* was done. Their suggestion of \"you go play on that side (of the whole school, blocking the bullies or us from pissing and drinking) and they'll be on that side), or they'd chuck us in a hidden away-ish spot and then, as you'd expext, more bullying happened.\n\nI was miserable, and Dad was picking me up. Both my parents were working with the school to stop this happening, it wasn't enough.

He said that there was a little incident but nothing serious.\n\nI told him EVERYTHING.\n\nHis solution was the yard separation, Dad asked \"Now how does that make you feel?\"\n\nI said \"It feels like I'm being punished for doing nothing\".\n\n\nIt got better, they talked to the parents via the school, which is safer for you, and has more negotiation.\n\n\nAs a kid who has C-PTSD from this and other stuff, ya gotta make sure that your daughter knows she can talk to you (which it seems she does), and then, sternly talk to the school.
