He is not in her class but has been harassing her during common periods like recess and lunch. In addition to his treatment he is also encouraging others to participate in harassing her. We spoke to both the principal and her teacher about the issue but I am not sure what action has been taken.\n\nToday walking home from school with my 8yr old daughter she was acting odd and not wanting to cross the street. Apparently the young boy (maybe 9 years old) who has been harassing her at the school playground was there walking home with his father and she wanted to avoid him. Instead I asked her to point him out and went over to meet him. I asked his name and if he new my daughter. The kid went blank and I told him some kids at school were giving my daughter a hard time and asked if he new anything about it. At this point the father became irate and started cursing at me. I was a bit surprised by this because if the roles were switched I would probably apologize and have a stern conversation with my kid. He was upset not with the child but with me and thus we walked away. \n\nIn hindsight I think the father became aggravated because the boy looked frightened and ready to poop his pants. Perhaps frightened by me or maybe by the fact that his father now new how he was behaving in school. Either way I frightened a kid and pissed off his father. Maybe I am the bad guy here but at least my daughter knows to stand up for herself and not to be afraid of some mean kid in the schoolyard.", "created_utc": 1672888391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103nwku/aita_for_introducing_myself_to_my_daughters_bully/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The father's reaction was disproportionate and you were a good role model for your daugther. NTA.", "I mean NTA, you were pleasant and he was verbally abusive. But are you familiar with the saying **The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree?** \n\nWhile there are obvious exceptions, a lot of times a bully is a reflection of their parents.", "NTA but pls note that many bullies are themselves abused at home. There was a shitty little 1st grade classmate of my son who called him names, harassed him in the bathroom, etc. My first reaction was, FIRST GRADE?!?! this happens? Then I found out from a friend that the kid's parents were divorcing. \n\nI totally went to bat for my son, spoke to the teachers and principle. They intervened as possible, but I used this as an opportunity to explain the whole 'hurt people hurt people' thing.  \n\nIt's been a few years, and building up my son and then daughter's resilience to bullies was a gradual process... but just yesterday my 9 year old daughter was bullied at camp. She spoke to the teachers AND she confronted the mean girls! Apparently she stuck out her hand, and said, I'd like a truce. I don't like how you're talking to me, and you have to stop, but I'd like to be friends.\n\nThis is a great time to build self confidence and provide the tools to handle these sorts of conflicts. It's worth the effort to focus on how your child manages these situations, as we all know you can't control what other people do. \u2764\ufe0f", "INFO: Was your tone sarcastic/confrontational when you approached the boy and his father? As in, was it obvious that you already knew the boy was the one bullying your daughter?\n\nIt's not uncommon that bullies come from broken/abusive homes and I wouldn't be surprised if this boy is one of them, based on the way his father reacted. I don't think you did anything wrong if your tone when you approached them wasn't sarcastic/aggressive/confrontational. Because I understand why you might 'play dumb' and not outwardly tell the father his son is bullying others until you can gauge what kind of parent he is. Clearly you were right to be careful, if that was your thinking.\n\nIf you were sarcastic or cynical, on the other hand, so it was obvious based on your tone that you already knew the boy was the bully -- you might be TA. Because you wouldn't have taken into consideration that it might endanger the boy to approach his father, that he may have picked up the anti-social behavior he exhibits in school from home. I don't think you had bad intentions -- you definitely weren't looking to endanger this kid -- but it's something to consider in the future. The boy might have looked as frightened as he did because of the way he anticipated his father would react and punish him. Just look at the way the father reacted to you, regardless of whether or not you were a bit sarcastic or immature.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying it's always wrong to approach the parents of your child's bully. Just make sure you have an idea of who you're talking to, because bringing such information to other parents only helps solve you/your child's cause as long as the parents can be trusted to act on it accordingly, responsibly and appropriately as parents.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the patent thought they were accomplishing - it seems clear to me they know their kid is a bully and an asshole. \n\nThat kid\u2019s lucky you were so mellow. You didn\u2019t threaten him or accuse him of anything. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have been as calm as you were", "NTA it's obvious where he gets it from kind of sad really because he probably wouldn't be a bully", "NTA. You didn't threaten the kid. My mom has done worse and I'd do worser if I have kids.", "INFO how did your daughter react to this? I feel like this is light Y T A because you directly went against her wishes. Maybe you did in fact teach her to stand up for herself, but it also sounds like you put her in an uncomfortable situation that she wanted to avoid. How did she feel after that interaction?", "You seem to think you were being subtle. You weren't. \n\nLets say that a random man comes up to your daughter in the middle of the street, basically ignores you and starts accusing her of bullying someone. They're pushy, they're tall and intimidating your terrified child (because stranger danger! Strange adult!)l; physically standing in front of the two of you and boy that sounds like using their size to block your daughter in. They're not listening and putting their own narrative first, the whole works.  And once again, they're doing all this to your daughter in front of you and ignoring you the whole time.\n\nAt that point, it doesn't matter if there's even a shred of truth to the accusations - you're a crazy, aggressive adult. Get the eff away from my kid.\n\nYou want to help your daughter, and that's admirable. But this isn't helping and it isn't how you teach your daughter to stand up for herself. That isn't how you raise an issue with another child's parents. That's how you escalate a problem and make it worse, and how you make an enemy of the people you need to be on your side. YTA in this action", "I'd be pissed too if some adult randomly came up to my kid as we were walking home.  YTA.", "YTA.\n\nIn a situation like this you should start the conversation with the father. He\u2019s not wrong for a grown woman to come and start talking to my kid, a minor. If the child is bullying your daughter you start with the parent because parents are responsible for minors.", "YTA. First of all, you don\u2019t confront a nine-year-old kid.

They were cousins. School wouldn\u2019t do anything. I talked to counselor and principal. No effect. Until my mom was in car pool asking if they were my friends.  Office pulled her in for that.  Then they tried to say it was nonsense and normal.   I spoke my peace and my mom advocated for me.  Finally they stepped in.  You\u2019re doing the right thing", "NTA. Normalizing beating bullies, because thats what you could have done and still not been TA. Or at least his father.", "NTA. I think confronting the bully is always the right decision, especially, since the school is dragging its feet. \n\nKeep pestering the school until they take a firm stand and put consequences in place for the bully. Start a daily log and record all interactions between your daughter and the children bullying her and make a time/date entry for each time you reach out to the school. Go up the food chain if you must.", "This. \n\nAssuming the father knows his kid is a bully!", "Yeah, I'm trying to put myself in that parents role. \n\nI think the problem lies in directly talking to the kid, and I may have a problem with that as well. Although probably wouldn't have reacted the same way as him.. I just wouldn't ever approach a kid like that \n\nInstead - if you had addressed the parent first, introduced yourself, said your daughter said she knew their son and asked if you could ask him a question about something going on at school- they'd either feel better about it, or they'd say no in which case I'd ask to talk to the parent. Either right there, or exchange numbers so you can talk with no kids around if they're more comfortable with that.", "It wasn\u2019t randomly.", "To the Dad it was randomly.  He's walking home with his kid and a woman walks up to his son, asks his name, and starts asking questions about the kids at school.  That's creepy.", "No. She was asking questions about someone bullying her child. Nothing creepy about it.", "NTA Sounds like the apple didn't fall far from the bully tree.", "NTA I did the same except I took one step further and volunteered at her elementary school a few times and just smiled at the group and introduced myself to their parents, and joined one of their social groups for business owners so they can see my slightly unhinged self lol. One later became her friend and says I am her crazy second mom lol but her real mom still avoids me. They are now 20 \ud83d\ude02", "You\u2019re NTA. I would make the school aware of the encounter you had with this child and his father. This kid could be the victim of abuse. You also need to find out why his bullying if your child hasn\u2019t been addressed.", "NTA\n\nAll my teachers, from ones that had just started to the experienced Masters told me this:\n\nThe way a kid acts is just a reflection of how their parents act.  If a kid is failing school, chances are his parents don\u2019t care and won\u2019t show up for parent-teachers.  And they never did.", "You aren't the arsehole, but I think there could be a different approach.\n\nLet's take my Dad and I for example. I was bashed at school, verbally abused etc. And *nothing* was done. Their suggestion of \"you go play on that side (of the whole school, blocking the bullies or us from pissing and drinking) and they'll be on that side), or they'd chuck us in a hidden away-ish spot and then, as you'd expext, more bullying happened.\n\nI was miserable, and Dad was picking me up. Both my parents were working with the school to stop this happening, it wasn't enough. I told Dad that I had been kicked in my back twice, while trying to run away.\n\nHe said \"Come on!\"\n\nWe walked to the office and said he wanted to speak to the principal (who is an absolute arse) sternly, and we went in.\n\nHe asked if he was aware of what happened today. He said that there was a little incident but nothing serious.\n\nI told him EVERYTHING.\n\nHis solution was the yard separation, Dad asked \"Now how does that make you feel?\"\n\nI said \"It feels like I'm being punished for doing nothing\".\n\n\nIt got better, they talked to the parents via the school, which is safer for you, and has more negotiation.\n\n\nAs a kid who has C-PTSD from this and other stuff, ya gotta make sure that your daughter knows she can talk to you (which it seems she does), and then, sternly talk to the school. Make change happen. Communicate fully, phone calls and emails aren't enough. You need supports, meetings etc.\n\nI wish you and your daughter luck, I really do.", "NTA,  as you merely asked him if he knew anything.  There was no accusation.", "If someone walked up to me and my kid and started addressing them without speaking to me I\u2019d have an issue. However I would also want to hear you out if it involves bullying. ESH.", "YTA. You should have spoken to the father. He was right there.", "Thats not what happened Lmao", "The father might be a bully too. My ex-friend's husband was a bully to their kid and now she's a bully.", "Absolutely!\n\nMost bullies are bullied at home or have learned the behaviour from \u201ctrusted adults\u201d"]}
