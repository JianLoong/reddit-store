But are you familiar with the saying **The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree?** \n\nWhile there are obvious exceptions, a lot of times a bully is a reflection of their parents.", "NTA but pls note that many bullies are themselves abused at home. There was a shitty little 1st grade classmate of my son who called him names, harassed him in the bathroom, etc. My first reaction was, FIRST GRADE?!?! this happens? Then I found out from a friend that the kid's parents were divorcing. \n\nI totally went to bat for my son, spoke to the teachers and principle. They intervened as possible, but I used this as an opportunity to explain the whole 'hurt people hurt people' thing.   EDIT: this is not my usual response. Please see my add on comments at end of this comment. \n\nIt's been a few years, and building up my son and then daughter's resilience to bullies was a gradual process... but just yesterday my 9 year old daughter was bullied at camp. She spoke to the teachers AND she confronted the mean girls! Apparently she stuck out her hand, and said, I'd like a truce. I don't like how you're talking to me, and you have to stop, but I'd like to be friends.\n\nThis is a great time to build self confidence and provide the tools to handle these sorts of conflicts. It's worth the effort to focus on how your child manages these situations, as we all know you can't control what other people do. \n\nTelling my kids that sometimes mean people do mean things because their life is awful has nothing to do with how they interact with said mean people. It has everything to do with building emotional intelligence and empathy in MY KIDS. I don't want them to exhibit unkindness when they can do otherwise. I don't want to find out that MY KIDS are bullies. I was bullied for years in elementary and middle school. Never told anyone. I endured. Not going to let that happen to or by me kids.\n\nI make it clear that my kids are my priority when these situations occur. Ask how they feel. Do they want me to intervene. Press and offer tactics anyway if they will listen. I've told kids to their faces that their behavior is not ok, etc. My kids also know how to escalate from bully to teacher if need be.\n\nEDIT to add advice I gave in a private chat\n\nMy foundation is of course building trust and confidence that I will: listen and tell the kids they're heard, offer reassurance and point out why the bullies are wrong about them, suggest how to react and actually practice potential reactions, and talk to whichever adult I need to ensure my kid knows I'm doing my best to protect them and get some action for the situation.\n\nI'm lucky that teachers etc have been responsive. I have and will include school counselors and the principal in these conversations. \n\nBuilding that trust tho... they never hesitate to tell me when something is wrong, and that's so key. Because how can you help if you don't know?!\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\nAnother little add on. I use the actual words, 'I hear you' with my kids. I saw that in a post somewhere, and saying those words make a difference.", "INFO: Was your tone sarcastic/confrontational when you approached the boy and his father? As in, was it obvious that you already knew the boy was the one bullying your daughter?\n\nIt's not uncommon that bullies come from broken/abusive homes and I wouldn't be surprised if this boy is one of them, based on the way his father reacted. I don't think you did anything wrong if your tone when you approached them wasn't sarcastic/aggressive/confrontational. Because I understand why you might 'play dumb' and not outwardly tell the father his son is bullying others until you can gauge what kind of parent he is. Clearly you were right to be careful, if that was your thinking.\n\nIf you were sarcastic or cynical, on the other hand, so it was obvious based on your tone that you already knew the boy was the bully -- you might be TA. Because you wouldn't have taken into consideration that it might endanger the boy to approach his father, that he may have picked up the anti-social behavior he exhibits in school from home. I don't think you had bad intentions -- you definitely weren't looking to endanger this kid -- but it's something to consider in the future. The boy might have looked as frightened as he did because of the way he anticipated his father would react and punish him. Just look at the way the father reacted to you, regardless of whether or not you were a bit sarcastic or immature.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying it's always wrong to approach the parents of your child's bully. Just make sure you have an idea of who you're talking to, because bringing such information to other parents only helps solve you/your child's cause as long as the parents can be trusted to act on it accordingly, responsibly and appropriately as parents.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the patent thought they were accomplishing - it seems clear to me they know their kid is a bully and an asshole. \n\nThat kid\u2019s lucky you were so mellow.

You weren't. \n\nLets say that a random man comes up to your daughter in the middle of the street, basically ignores you and starts accusing her of bullying someone.

Strange adult!)l; physically standing in front of the two of you and boy that sounds like using their size to block your daughter in. They're not listening and putting their own narrative first, the whole works.  And once again, they're doing all this to your daughter in front of you and ignoring you the whole time.\n\nAt that point, it doesn't matter if there's even a shred of truth to the accusations - you're a crazy, aggressive adult. Get the eff away from my kid.\n\nYou want to help your daughter, and that's admirable. But this isn't helping and it isn't how you teach your daughter to stand up for herself. That isn't how you raise an issue with another child's parents. That's how you escalate a problem and make it worse, and how you make an enemy of the people you need to be on your side.

I think confronting the bully is always the right decision, especially, since the school is dragging its feet. \n\nKeep pestering the school until they take a firm stand and put consequences in place for the bully.

If a kid is failing school, chances are his parents don\u2019t care and won\u2019t show up for parent-teachers.  And they never did.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't the arsehole, but I think there could be a different approach.\n\nLet's take my Dad and I for example. I was bashed at school, verbally abused etc. And *nothing* was done. Their suggestion of \"you go play on that side (of the whole school, blocking the bullies or us from pissing and drinking) and they'll be on that side), or they'd chuck us in a hidden away-ish spot and then, as you'd expext, more bullying happened.\n\nI was miserable, and Dad was picking me up.

And now my kid avoids this other one. And he's so beautifully casual about it. No angst. Just, that kid is an asshole so I ignore him. I'm proud of my kids. I know they'll be in therapy for something I do, but it won't be for this. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. However, it's concerning how the dad and boy both reacted. My first thought when you said how scared the boy was, was that his dad was about to take him home and beat him. I would actually mention this whole situation to the school counselor, so they know that 1) you spoke to them about this issue and 2) maybe they should keep an eye on the boy for signs of abuse.", "This. I distinctly remember how small I felt when I learned my childhood bully was being regularly beaten by his father. (and got beaten worse when the school reported the bullying).", "NTA\n\nyou're never the bad guy for protecting your kid ? like ever ? also, this is probably why I'm not a parent but if my kid didn't even want to cross the road because her bully was on the other side , I'd be called a deadbeat because my ass would be in jail. as for the father, whether he was yelling at you to simply back off kinda explains why his son is a bully.", "NTA. Might be time to call the school.", "NTA.  You saw where the kid gets it from.", "NTA- seems the kid gets it from his dad", "NTA some people bully due to their home life and maybe you got to see why the kid isn\u2019t happy at home. Hopefully he will think twice about annoying your daughter. It doesn\u2019t sound like you threatened him but if the conversation continued you should have addressed his father so he can handle his son", "NTA\n\nMy younger brother and I are 4 years apart and when we were in elementary school there was this kid that started giving him a hard time at recess. The kid was a year older than him. I can't remember exactly what it was he said to my brother but it was a racial comment and we're mixed race, so my brother told me about it and I decided to confront the kid. I went up to him and brought one of my friends with me and asked the kid \"what's your problem with my brother?\" The kid didn't say anything and just ran away. \n\nI guess he went and told his teacher, who was my teacher previously, and she came and pulled me out of my class to talk to me. She asked me why I was \"bothering\" the kid. I explained to her that he was bothering my brother and I was simply asking him what his problem is. She told me to stay out of it and mind my business essentially, and leave it to my brothers teacher and her to handle. \n\nI few days later I was playing football (or soccer) at recess with my friends. I was in net and drop kicked the ball, the kick was ass and the ball went flying towards the pavement and HIT THE KID WHO WAS GIVING MY BROTHER A HARD TIME OUT OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE FACE. This was 100% unintentional i swear on my life. Anyway the kid had to go to the office, I never got in trouble for this as it was clearly an accident to all the teachers. But yeah, and the kid never bothered my brother again.", "NTA at all. You maintained a simple composure while also letting the kid know there was a \u201cfind out\u201d coming for his \u201cfuck around\u201d.", "NTA. Dealing with bullying isn't easy. You let the kid know that you know about it. You gave a strong hint to the parent that his son is a bully. That's a decent enough tradeoff over maybe freaking out the parents of a bully.", "Absolutely NTA! Please give an update hopefully your daughter is being left alone", "As a parent I would be pretty freaked out if a strange adult came up, ignored me and started addressing my child. I might not even be able to listen to them at first because my first reaction would be mama bear protection.\n\nI think a better way to do this would have been to talk to the Father and then include the child. I think the Father would have been more willing to listen if you had approached him parent to parent rather than taking over his parenting role.", "YTA for trying to intimidate a child instead of talking to his parent who is right there.", "NTA but a hero in my eyea. The reaction of the father spoke by itself. Kid is a bully, because of how he's being raised. If anything,  you stood up for your daughter and showed her you care about her. Hopefully the kid will thread carefully from now on, and you can rest assured his parents know what's going on, so they can't excuse themselves saying  they didnt.", "ESH, ofc you should advocate for your child but I'd be concerned about the boy's safety after he's been 'shown up in public'. If his dad reacted like that to you it's probably a lot worse behind closed doors. The kid is acting like a shit don't get me wrong, and it needs to be stopped, but there's potential safeguarding issues here that the school might be aware of that you aren't. And the kid is 10. 10yos are idiots. 10yos with shitty parents doubly so. I don't know, I completely get your intentions, I'd just feel real shitty if that kid turns up with a black eye or something tomorrow", "I agree..I think the father's reaction is very telling. He obviously knows his kid is a bully.", "I agree and think the father's reaction means he knows his son is being bully", "Agree with this. NTA - my mom did this for me when I was little girl and was terrorized at school and I know she has zero regrets. \n\nI\u2019m 33 years old. I still think about the effect being bullied had on me. If the two kids that bullied me as a kid walked into this room right this second I\u2019d know who they are and have zero problems ruining their day. \n\nYour daughter is fortunate to have you as a parent. Keep it up.", "Be careful how you talk about the whole \"hurt people hurt people\" thing. I was bullied relentlessly for years and I absolutely HATED when my mother would pull out that \"they have a hard home life\" shit. I didn't want to hear excuses for why they were treating me that way, I wanted it to STOP. And if it wasn't going to stop I at least wanted to hear that it wasn't okay for the other kids to act like that and that my own mother was actually on my side.", "Have you considered notifying the school that you will get a lawyer and police involved if the physical assaults continue?", "They did talk to both the principal and the teacher", "you just commented a totally different scenario that did not happen, how is it relevant?", "how did she intimidate the kid? she just asked if he knew anything about her daughter being bullied.", "Nope, I don't harass anyone. We went to the school, first the teacher and then the principal.", "him being bullied at home would explain his behavior, but not justify it though", "If some adult walked up to your child and started accusing him of shit without introducing themselves to you/addressing you, you wouldn't get angry or be rude?", "Or the father is a bully/abuser and the kid is mirroring what he sees at home. Adult bullies lack empathy and it's not that farfetched to think dad is oblivious. His anger response does not conclusively indicate he knows his kid bullies others. His kid looking afraid tends to suggest he doesn't know and the kid is terrified he just got in trouble with his father, who seems to have a bad anger management problem. It's concerning for that kid too, not just OP's daughter. \n\nNot to say, of course, that OP didn't do the right thing by overtly standing up for her daughter.", "Pls see my additional comments.", "You definitely intimidated and were completely out of line. YTA. And if I was his parent I would reported you to the school and made sure everyone knew about your unacceptable behavior.", "i mean you\u2019re not wrong , it doesn\u2019t justify it, but also a 9 year old being physically abused? there\u2019s really not much he can do, especially with his pre-frontal cortex barely being developed at all. and if nobody\u2019s ever told him it was wrong then there\u2019s genuinely no way he would know any different. like it would take somebody telling him it\u2019s not okay & explaining why for him to change his behavior, which we don\u2019t know if anyone has done", "assuming the physical abuse is occurring, anyway", "As a teacher, it is far less common that a child who is a bully DOESN'T have at least one parent who is also a bully. They learned somewhere.\n\nApples, trees, all that.", "I mean, this is immediately what I started thinking.", "Was there any accusations? Seemed like she was playing dumb, not being outright aggressive.\n\nAnd to add, if someone came up to me and my son and seemed to be hinting at him being a bully, I\u2019d want more information so I would have the full picture and could talk with my son properly.", "Good! I see too often people pushing the \"they're hurting too\" to do nothing about it. I want EVERYONE to heal, not for one kid to be a punching bag for another because they're perpetuating a cycle.\n\nI was bullied heavily for YEARS. When very young I wasn't very nice back because I never had kindness modeled to me at home OR at school, so I didn't know how to act. I wasn't a bully, but I sure wasn't kind either, and I feel awful for those I was unkind to. I want everybody to heal.", "You did your best.", "So sad... This isn't even that surprising though... Children do learn many of their behaviors at home after all. OP's interaction kind of sounds to me like, based on the child's fearful reaction and the father's instantly angered response, OP may have inadvertently sparked an instance of the dad abusing his kid when they got home. OP should have gone to the school counselor first and have them talk to the kid. It's a shame that that's the safer option, but child abuse is an age-old problem.", "I know. It's one of those things that's not objectively my fault, but still made me feel shitty. I finally worked up the courage to say something only to find out later that his dad punched him in the face and broke his nose when he found out. That's a heavy thing to lay on a 2nd grader.", "I mean. Op did go to the school. They went to the principal and the teacher who, apparently, haven't done anything of note.", "That was my thought as well."]}
