My family and I (39M) traveled to visit my wife\u2019s parents for Thanksgiving which involved a 5ish hour drive one way. My daughter (13F) had gotten the new Zelda game for her birthday a couple weeks ago and spent the drive playing basically nonstop. On the drive back home, we stopped about 2 hours in for gas and a bathroom break. My wife and daughter went inside while I gassed up before going with my son to the men\u2019s room. When we got out, my wife and daughter were already in the car, so we got back on the road.\n\nNot even half an hour later, my daughter announced that she had to go to the bathroom and asked if we were stopping soon. I\u2019m not a dickhead (maybe an asshole?) so I wasnt *mad* but I was confused. I asked her if her stomach was okay, and she said that yes, she felt fine, and that she didn\u2019t have to pee when we stopped but had to pee now. I gave my wife a look, and she stammered that she (daughter) said she didn\u2019t have to go. Fine. Whatever. Dumb, but whatever.\n\nI asked my daughter if she needed us to stop right this second, or if she could hold it for a bit. She said that she had to go, but could wait.\n\nAnother 10 or so minutes passed before she frantically asked if we could stop because she really couldn\u2019t wait. I told her I would get off at the exit with a bathroom.\n\nNeedless to say, she didn\u2019t make it. My wife is annoyed with me for not stopping immediately, I\u2019m annoyed with her for letting her say she didn\u2019t have to go when I suspect she just wanted to get back to her game, and we\u2019re both annoyed with my daughter for wetting herself when it was easily, *easily* avoidable.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701129436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185hwxa/aita_after_my_daughter_wet_herself_in_the_car/", "score": 960, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you\u2019re really that worried about her game use then deal with that separately. I remember crying in the  back seat of our family vehicle because I had to pee so bad and my dad would not stop, I didn\u2019t need to ask to know. And if I\u2019d had an accident it would have been much much worse. I\u2019m 39 and that shit still bothers me. Don\u2019t be a bomb that\u2019s always going off emotionally around the family.

As a woman who literally can pee and then 30 minutes later have to go again, or not have to go for a whole day and then suddenly need to go so bad if I don\u2019t get to a bathroom in 5 minutes I will pee myself I feel so bad for your daughter. \n\nI am the stereotype of the girl that has to pee every 5 seconds. I am the reason for most bathroom breaks on any road trip. Even now my 5 year old son can last longer in a car than me. When I was a preteen/teen I would have to stop at least once almost every time we went to my grandparents house when it was only 1 hour 15 minutes away. And then I often would have to race to the bathroom as soon as I got there. Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is to be the person that doesn\u2019t have to go and then suddenly has to go RIGHT NOW?\n\nIf she told you she needed to go and you passed exits that she could have gone at then yes it is on you. And if you have to stop either way why does it matter if you do the next 10 miles before or after you stop? You will be traveling that same amount of time and then stopping for the same amount of time either way. Pushing the extra little bit is not going to save you time unless you didn\u2019t have any exits with gas stations or fast food places or whatever nearby.", "YTA\n\nYou know what the appropriate way to handle this is? You say \u201cnext exit is in an hour can you make it or do I need to look for a good place to pull over?\u201d and then pull over if needed.

Making your kid wet herself because she didn\u2019t try to go every stop is fucking messed up.", "YTA - Stop the car and let the girl pee. You\u2019re also mad at your wife because of things you assumed.", "YTA! You have no idea how full her bladder is or why she had to pee so bad. You should have taken her urgency as a sign to stop immediately. \n\nFor reference, when I have my period, I have to pee urgently. Cramps mess up your bladder.

When someone says the need the bathroom, you stop.", "Sounds like you\u2019re a harsh man. Do you like the way your wife and daughter respond to you with fear? I would do some self reflection and yes YTA for causing your daughter to wet herself in the car. YOU. You\u2019re the driver. If someone says they have to pee, you pull over.", "YTA, and I'm going to say you're an extra asshole for trying to act like your daughter pissed herself because of the game. It had nothing to do with the game, she put it down, went inside and took a break. When nature calls, it calls my dude. If she's a 13 year old girl I doubt she has a grown man sized bladder.", "YTA.  Plus, when a teenaged girl suddenly begs for a bathroom break, there is a strong likelihood she may have started her period unexpectedly or may need to change pad/tampon sooner than expected.  It doesn\u2019t sound like her period was involved here, but as the parent of a teenage girl, you should be aware of this and not respond by grilling her or demanding to know if she can hold it.", "After reading a lot of these comments and everybody talking about how 13 is too old to do that, she should\u2019ve said that she needed you to stop now, I\u2019m willing to bet that the conversation between the three of you in the car, you were not being nice. I\u2019m willing to bet that you either came off very angry at your daughter for needing to stop after you had already stopped.. or maybe you were even yelling and cussing I don\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t there, but if you were, that\u2019s probably why she told you she could wait. Whether she\u2019s three years old 13 years old, if you lose your temper every time she makes a mistake or acts like a kid, then she\u2019s going to tell you whatever she thinks she want to hear regardless on whether it\u2019s true or not. So, even though she really had to pee and probably deep she knew she wasn\u2019t going to make it, she was probably more afraid of you getting mad at her and yelling at her for having to stop and trying really really hard just to hold it to appease you. If were cool,collected and spoke with her calmly And did not raise your voice or lose your temper at all then you\u2019re not an that\u2019s one thing, but if you have a history of losing your shit every time your \"by your kid\", then you definitely are an AH because kids are going to be annoying.", "You\u2019re implying, it seems, that she didn\u2019t go in because she was playing her Zelda game. Otherwise why mention it? And I can certainly not need to pee but desperately need to 30 mins later. Also how much time passed between her telling you and \u201cthe next exit\u201d? Sounds like you didn\u2019t stop right away to punish her for not going (for playing Zelda) at the stop 30 mins before. That makes YTA.", "Dude I have to pee now. Not 20 minutes ago or in 20 minutes. Next time pull over immediately YTA", "As a former preschool teacher, the rule was, even if you don\u2019t have to go, you pull down your pants and sit on the toilet for 30 seconds. If you don\u2019t go, that\u2019s fine. But they always went. Then, if you need to go again, fine. That\u2019s always ok. \n\nThis rule can apply to your daughter as well. She\u2019s 13. She should know and be able to communicate when she needs the bathroom. But since she seems addicted to her game (whole other issue), she needs to be told to go and use the toilet no matter what. I realize it\u2019s not good for your bladder to go when you don\u2019t have to, but once in a while on car trips is not gonna do any permanent damage. I think every 2 hours is the perfect amount of time. \n\nNTA", "Bro, chill.", "YTA she gave you plenty of advance warning and the game had nothing to do with it. You just want a convenient excuse so it\u2019s not your fault.", "YTA you even said it yourself. Why did you need to ask the wife? Sometimes women have to pee a half hour after going again or maybe she didn't need to go before. Maybe she is near her period. You sound hard to talk to. Next time pull over for your damn kid and get over yourself. It's not stupid she asked to go to the bathroom what else did you need to understand. Smh", "What does playing Zelda have to do with this story?", "YTA here. You\u2019re making assumptions and blaming a child for her bodily functions, not to mention putting her in an embarrassing situation and then not supporting her but being annoyed. One of you is an adult and one is a child. Act accordingly.", "Accidents happen", "YTA. That's why I won't go on road trips with my husband. He won't stop when one of us needs to pee. I think maybe the male anatomy is designed better for holding it for a long time. Girls don't work that way.", "When will everyone get it that when a female says she has to pee, it means NOW. Dad the asshole here", "YTA but not just because of your part in this story. I can\u2019t imagine a parent would provide an opportunity for a bunch of internet strangers to talk about their child like this even though it\u2019s anonymously. This is your child.", "What exactly you wanted to achieve by asking her to wait a little bit longer? Some kind of lesson, a prize \"he made his daughter to hold it long enough\"? YTA", "NAH for the situation in my opinion, but if my dad posted about me having an accident on reddit for thousands of people to see when I was a thirteen year old girl I would be devastated. (It actually did happen to me, I had sepsis and all my digestive organs stopped working for a bit, except my dad posted it on \\*facebook!!\\*)  Better hope she doesn't use reddit.", "NAH. Your daughter is old enough to know she should try to use the restroom when on a road trip without needing a reminder from your wife. She\u2019s also old enough to communicate and be believed when she says she can wait and it\u2019s not urgent. This seems like an unpleasant experience for everyone involved but especially your daughter, unfortunately based on your description it seems like the only person who could have prevented this incident was your daughter so hopefully it\u2019s a learning moment.", "YTA. Someone in your car needed to pee and you didn't stop soon enough. It wasn't her decision to need to pee, and she is not in control. You can't expect perfect communication from a young teen. If you do, that's bad parenting. As was this move. Then to get annoyed at her and your wife about it? And the implication that she's the irresponsible one because you think she was too engrossed in her game? This is ridiculous man. As our Melania says 'be better'.", "INFO\n\nWhy mention the gaming? Did she take her switch inside the gas station and that's why she didn't use the bathroom? Did you assume she didn't want to put down her game to go to the bathroom while you were already back on the road?", "If anything I think ESH except the kid because she\u2019s a kid. The adults should know better. Your wife for not telling her that you probably won\u2019t stop again for awhile so she make effort to go then, and you for not recognizing that the kid was probably too embarrassed she didn\u2019t go before to make you stop right away", "NAH. Drop the annoyance. It happens.", "YTA, 100%.\n\nI'm a grown woman and sometimes it can hit me out of nowhere. The fact that she waited with the faith that you were going to find a bathroom ASAP for her, and it was 10 minutes and you still hadn't bothered to get to an exit yet? \n\nIt sounds like you were just trying to punish her because her bladder didn't work on your schedule.\n\nNevermind the fact that it's very unhealthy for a person to hold their pee for long periods of time.", "She should have gone at the gas station, but letting her wet herself is an AH move. She\u2019ll never forget that moment and you humiliated her. And why did your wife stammer when you gave her \u201cthe look\u201d? Oh, because YTA.", "YTA. Sure it\u2019s annoying to have to stop so soon again after the previous break, but stuff happens all the time on road trips that delay you one way or another. You might as well make sure everyone is comfortable.\n\nOne thing you don\u2019t seem to have considered is if your daughter has started her period. It takes a long time for young women to figure out what works for them in terms of products, and even then, sometimes the products just fail. Hell on earth for any woman is knowing your period product has failed but you are unable to get to a bathroom to fix the situation. You can\u2019t control the flow, and every second delayed means that much more of a chance your clothes and seat get blood stained. This isn\u2019t what happened here, because obviously your daughter did wet herself, but in the time between her asking you to stop and you actually stopping,  why didn\u2019t you think that a failed period product could be a possibility, because it\u2019s extremely likely for her age?", "YTA. Of course you are TA. There is no question.", "i love how you felt the need to specifically point out she got the new Zelda and spent the drive playing it, as if that's the problem here.

You\u2019re the driver. Someone says they have to go, you find the first available exit not see how long you can make them wait.", "Why is stopping for a couple minutes such a big deal?", "YTA. Seriously man. That is your kid. What would stopping have cost? 10 min at most? You have a whole built in thing that made you post here, we call that guilt.

When I drive myself, I stop every hour or so.", "YTA: Someone says they need to go and is a kid, driver pulls over at next available exit this is road trip 101.  The second time it happens is when you get to be a little annoyed not the first.  Sometimes you don't register you have to go.  I have ADD and I can tell you right now I can go from \"I don't need to go\" to \"holy crap if I don't right now I will pee myself\" even at 30 I forget to try because especially on road trips the last thing I want is to go into a public restroom \"just to try\".  I also make it a point to not ride with AH though so that might be an adult bonus....", "NTA. It is common courtesy to use the bathroom when a bathroom break is available with multiple people traveling. If everyone only goes when they \u201cneed to \u201c instead of at the scheduled stop, they would be making 3 stops in 3 hours.  Expecting someone to turn off at the next exit after a half hour drive is silly. OP did ask if they can hold and she said she could.

Unless she was okay with peeing on the side of the road (I don't know too many girls who would be comfortable with that) what else were you to do?\n\nIt's a natural consequence that she can learn from.

The fact that you even had to ask cements it for me, honestly. Gas station bathrooms are disgusting, and women have to touch a lot more of those areas with different parts of their bodies than men do.

It sounds silly, but planning ahead like this really isn\u2019t intuitive when your prefrontal cortex won\u2019t be fully developed for at least another 10 years.\n\nI\u2019m confused why you added the video game bit.

Most girls her age have started their periods and are still getting the hang of dealing with them. \n\nPeriod accidents can happen out of nowhere and are *really* embarrassing, especially if you\u2019re around boys and men when they happen. \n\nYou should\u2019ve been mindful of this possibility and not prevented her from accessing a public toilet.\n\n**2.** Urinary frequency or a sudden urge to urinate can be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). \n\nUTIs are really painful and at least 50% of all girls and women will have at least one in their lifetime (often several). \n\nWhen you have a UTI, the urge to urinate is intense and persistent, even when your bladder is virtually empty. \n\nIn cases where the pain is severe, a person may avoid using the toilet until they absolutely have to, which can lead to accidents if they\u2019re unable to access a toilet immediately.\n\nWhich leads me to the next point\u2026\n\n**3.** Holding in urine for too long can increase the risk of *developing* a UTI. \n\nIf you don\u2019t regularly empty your bladder, harmful bacteria that may be present in the urine and/or the urinary tract can multiply, leading to an infection.\n\nSitting down in the same position for hours at a time, especially if it\u2019s hot or you\u2019re wearing tight pants (such as skinny jeans), can also increase the risk of developing a UTI.\n\n**4.** Holding in urine is bad for the kidneys and can damage them over time, if it becomes a habit. \n\nThis may be a one-off incident, but you need to teach your children to listen to their body\u2019s cues. Otherwise, these cues will become ineffective over time, which can lead to incontinence issues.\n\n**5.** She may not have felt comfortable or safe using the petrol station bathroom.\n\nThe bathroom might\u2019ve been disgustingly filthy, maybe there was no toilet paper, or maybe she felt unsafe because of another person. \n\nIf this is the case, she made the right decision. \n\n**6.** She could have an undiagnosed medical condition that results in bladder incontinence.\n\nIf this is a regular issue for her, she needs to see a doctor about it.\n\nAnd why was your wife stammering?

I guess we all make assumptions, huh?", "That sucks : (", "O, for sure. And honestly, I HAVE pissed on the side of the road when there were no stops in sight!  I also met a  super nice hippie homestead couple who were happy to let me use their 'composting' toilet- aka an outhouse. Cause it was better than not peeing.  I was like 16, and she was 'you're welcome to use it, but you may not like it'  Ma'am, at this point, I would use a bucket. Super nice people, I hope their farm is doing well.", "When I was a kid we would play rec sports and a lot of times the fields would be at the different elementary schools in the county, and the school would be locked and they wouldn't have bathrooms. To the tree line the entire team would go, it happens. Kids have little bladders. Lol. Some adults even have little bladders. My mom is a notorious stopper \ud83d\ude02", "My dad once had to pull over on the freeway so I could pee. He would then point out that tree every single time we passed it for the next fifteen years. He was not a compassionate person and he never knew when to let something go. OP\u2019s post reminds me of my dad.", "If not illegal, super unsafe. For a 13 yo without medical complications I\u2019d absolutely do next exit over this option.", "You open squat behind the open door while mom holds a towel or blanket blocking you. This is fairly common place", "Who\u2019s going to stop you? The highway patrol car that magically was following you, watching if you were going to stop and pee?", "She gave him advance warning...and he did nothing with it. This is not a situation where she failed to communicate. It's simply that OP didn't bother to listen.\n\nHell, she even communicated when her need was urgent! But instead of immediately pulling over, OP decided to just finally start looking for an exit. \n\nI think having to drive a piss-smelling car until he can get it cleaned is an appropriate consequence for OP to now suffer.", "\u201cYour wife is scared of you\u201d sure indicated a claim of abuse to me. Why would you be scared of someone who is not abusive?", "Think the wife says she never went but ill re read it later to double check\n\n\nNo i never lied about having to pee only to piss all over the car to avoid upsetting someone thats stupid", "I definitely got the impression that the daughter went from \"actually, it is an emergency\" to wetting herself quite quickly. Do you know if OP has responded to any comments about it? Which is probably the only way to know. I kind of feel it is either ESH, because the daughter is the one the needed to communicate her needs better, OP can't mind read or make truck stops appear. Or NAH, and there just needs to be better communication, like the driver letting people know how far away the next pit stop is, so people can make informed choices. And, both OP and the wife need to figure out a way for the daughter to be able to pee in the car if she does have three minutes or warning while on car trips.", "Are you like, just chugging water? If so, maybe don\u2019t do that when you\u2019re on a road trip and have limited bathroom stops.", "Well I spent a lot of time in the car with my family as a child and my mother was always upset. That didn\u2019t necessarily mean anything was wrong. That is just her natural state of being. Road trips are stressful, especially for a mom who likely had to pack for the entire family.", "I was also a 13 year old girl once. And have taught many middle school kids. They can be moody and unreasonable and communicate poorly and not really listen when you talk. I think they both learned their lesson. But OP should also not be espero be a mind reader. He stopped at a gas station. That\u2019s the universal symbol or \u201ceveryone go to the bathroom now\u201d", "She *did* communicate it.\n\n> She said that she had to go, but could wait.\n\nAnd then:\n\n> Another 10 or so minutes passed before she frantically asked if we could stop because she really couldn\u2019t wait.", "My mother would say this until the day she passed. I used to say it to her all the time too. \n\n\u201cMommy, we\u2019re going to get in the car and drive home, do you have to pee? Don\u2019t say no like that! I don\u2019t want to push you all the way out to the car and then put you in just to take you out and race you back in here.  You know what? It doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re going to try anyway.\u201d \n\nShe would always tell me she was a full grown adult and she didn\u2019t need me forcing her to \u201ctry\u201d but the second she was on that toilet she would pee. \n\nThe annoying bit is that despite me not having to pee, the minute I made her try was the minute I figured \u201cI might as well try\u201d and I ended up peeing too \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "My mom only stopped doing it to me at that age because we were visiting her brother and he shamed her for it. \n\nHer: We're leaving for church now, do you have to go before we do?\n\nMe: No\n\nHer: Should you at least try?\n\nMe: It's 10 minutes away, I'm fine. \n\nHer: Are you sure?\n\nHer brother: Are you kidding me right now? She's 26 I think she knows if she needs to pee!", "\u2026 I was trying to sound more normal when I said my parents would tell me as teenagers.  \n\nI\u2019m a full grown adult and my mom still tells me to go :p.    \nIf she sees me shaking my leg, she asks me if I need to pee", "This is correct. Pelvic floor PT can help with urge incentive, or the \u201clock and key\u201d phenomenon. Basically when you constantly empty a not-full bladder, you train your brain to give you the urge to pee when you don\u2019t really have to go, and it takes a lot of work to undo it. I grew up in a \u201cgolden rule\u201d (pee whenever you see a toilet basically) family and I have terrible urge incontinence now. It also affects teachers, nurses at a higher rate - professions where you can\u2019t just go to the bathroom when you have to, so you end up going when you can and it fucks up your bladder.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to force it for normal situations.    \nIt\u2019s only really for long distance trips, knowing that you cannot stop every half hour.", "This part lol. I have ADHD and at 28 sometimes I still don\u2019t notice I need to pee until I\u2019m suffering. At 13? I regularly held it on long car rides (like 7+ hours) and had to sprint to the nearest bathroom on arrival. If I\u2019m ever in the car with my parents they still suggest I try\u2014and I\u2019m more willing now as my body has changed a bit and \u201cholding it\u201d has become more difficult lol", "It's less that it's *ignoring* your bodily needs, it's more often that the brain just doesn't get the signal from the body part sending it, from my own (anecdotal) experience. My brain just won't always get my stomach's hunger signals - it's like it gets lost somewhere between stomach and brain. Like a cell phone losing connection and dropping a call.\n  \nI don't know if it's a neurotransmitter issue, or my body's not always properly producing the hunger hormone or whatever, but it's definitely *not* me deliberately ignoring it, I just *don't* get the hunger sensation, and if I don't remind myself to eat, I'll only notice when I start feeling shaky. It sucks, because I genuinely love food and eating, but my brain just doesn't always get the hunger signals.\n  \nThankfully, I don't have that issue with other needs like sleep or knowing when I need to go to the bathroom. Hell, my body gets the latter signals *VERY* clearly.", "It sound like the mother did, and the girl said she didn't need to go.  You can't make someone pee if they don't want to.", "Where does OP describe making negative comments, or any other type of unkindness, to the daughter after the incident? All I'm reading is who was annoyed at whom, but that's an emotion, not an action.", "Presumably not which is likely why they took the rest break when they did and asked if she could hold it.\n\n\nOp likely knew there wants anywhere to safely and Quickly stop", "She didnt pee herself in the rest stop\n\n\nShe did it in the car she was playing switch in", "Me and everyone i know has at some point needed to and peed themselves in an emergency\u2026.. and its on you when it happens.\n\n\nThis specific situation just seems so easily avoidable that i cant fault op getting annoyed", "I think most sane ppl would too.  But alas, here we are.", "Why didn\u2019t he get off at the next exit when she first said she had to go? He wasn\u2019t going to exit until she said it was urgent at which point, it was too late.", "Ew. What are you talking about? Hold it in and wait for the bathroom.", "Why would that commenter vote OP as NTA if they thought he was abusive?", "Ive never peed myself in the car before either but im glad you were never scared of making your parents upset before, sadly that\u2019s not the case for everyone.", "Nope, it just happens even if I'm drinking just a little gradually and even when I use the bathroom I still feel like I have to go not long after.", "Yeah I get that, I just meant I don't know if they were far away from any stops or if OP just wanted to cover more distance as I can't rly tell from the original post", "That\u2019s a really funny memory of her that made me smile. Thank you for sharing it.", "It's always good to go when you can - you never know when you'll next get the chance!\n\nIt was almost a mantra growing up and I've worked in several care & education jobs where you have to take any chance you get & we'd end up reminding or checking with each other!", "As soon as I started reading your comment, *Ah ha!* As a teacher, I am just about always dehydrated and yet: Can\u2019t risk drinking because there may be no chance to go, yet also have to go at any \u201copportunity.\u201d", "I know a lot of parents that want their kid to try every time a bathroom is available, I don't think it's helpful but fully admit that my kids are unusual when it comes to road trips. Neither of them like being rushed or going in \"the wild\". But, holding it hasn't caused any problems.", "So playing a video game in a vehicle that wouldn\u2019t pull over is what made her pee herself? Because the fact that she actually got out of the car at the rest stop to go inside proves the game had nothing to do with her not going then.", "She said she was fine for the time being.", "I have no idea why someone who said \u201cyour wife is scared of you\u201d would also not think that person is an asshole. That is a very good question actually\n\nETA: asshole should say abusive", "We cant just assume the teen is afraid of anything and peeing all over the car is in no way less aggravating than asking for a bathroom so that doesnt even make sense as an excuse", "Only the teen can answer why they decided to piss themselves and refuse restrooms", "She said she could hold it for a bit. For a kid who needs to pee, 10 minutes is a lot longer than a bit. She\u2019s 13 so may or may not have known how urgent it was when she said she could hold it. That\u2019s not saying she is fine.", "Because the question is sort of aita for being annoyed that this happened. They were saying he\u2019s not for getting annoyed, but then also said that there\u2019s a chance he\u2019s not pleasant when he\u2019s upset. Two different things. The man is likely one when he\u2019s annoyed, but he\u2019s not one for the act of having gotten annoyed.", "I doubt she intended to pee herself in the slightest. \n\nI get your point about assuming things (especially because this sub is horrible about that but I\u2019m personally seeing context clues that could point to that being the case."]}
