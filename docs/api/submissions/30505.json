He and I have been together for 5 years and our wedding is set to take place in this spring.\n\nSo for some backstory, when I was 18 I was on one date with a guy who was 18 too. We went out to dinner and I thought we had a really great time and really liked him. After our date, I texted him telling him I had a great time and I would love to meet him again. He just responded with telling me thanks, that he enjoyed our date but did not find a connection with me and would not want to see me anymore as he felt it would not be fair to me. I really liked this guy and was heartbroken, but I moved in.\n\nThree years later I met my now husband, when I met him I had no idea as to who he was. We hit it off and clicked instantly and fell hard for each other. It was not until 6 months later when I was at dinner with his family and his brother was there that I realized that his brother was the guy I went on a date with. I explained this to my husband, he was fine with it. I also messaged his brother telling him I did not know they were related in anyway but that I really liked his brother and would like it if he did not let our past together disturb my relationship. He responded by telling we that we were all good.\n\nHowever, he has continually flirted with me. When we meet him for dinner, he always flirts, saying stuff like telling me my dress looks nice, that I look great or telling me a specific thing on the menu looks like something I would like. He always does this in front of my husband who has not said a word about this. He also tries to make me jealous all the time, like when we all are out with his family he sometimes bring a girl with him if they have been dating for sometime and he will always kiss her on the cheek, talk with her all the time and flirting with her. \n\nI have kept my mouth shut about this as to not cause anything bad between him and my fianc\u00e9, but with wedding planning and sending out invites, I just had to say something. I told him I don\u2019t want his brother there because his brother always flirts with me and tries to make me jealous. My fianc\u00e9 looked dumbfounded and asked when this happens, if his brother does this stuff when he is at the bathroom or simply not looking. I told him no and brought up all the things I did here. My fianc\u00e9 laughed and asked me if I was okay in the head and if I was joking. I got angry at him and said that if he could not see how truly disgusting his brother\u2019s behavior is then he is not who I thought he was.\n\nWe have barely talked since this, I got a text from his brother saying that he was sorry if he ever made me feel uncomfortable and that he had no intention to make me feel that way. My fianc\u00e9 is still mad at me.\n\nWas I really the asshole for this? I just want my happiest day to be my happiest day and it can\u2019t be that if I have to worry about his brother doing something.", "created_utc": 1699362354, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ptv02/aita_for_not_wanting_my_soon_to_be_bil_at_my/", "score": 1035, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But the that's not the issue.  If you want a shot at a happy marriage, you need therapy.  You think that perfectly innocent behaviors between two other people are secretly about you.

Obviously trynna make me jealous\"\n\nNot every interaction is about you. You're his future SIL, he's trying to be nice. Just because someone tells you you look good doesn't mean they want you.

Also, unless the brother has done anything over the top, you don\u2019t think that your fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t want his own brother at his wedding?", "YTA-- this is some main character syndrome if ever there was. Him being nice to you and him dating other women really has nothing to do with your past. \n\nYou went on one date with this guy many years ago, and you're about to get married to someone else! Why is he living rent free in your head like this?", "YTA.  You went on ONE date with the man.  You hardly have \"history\".  As to the flirting it just sounds like he's an outgoing fun guy who is trying to be nice to you.  Make you jealous?  WHY would you be jealous?  The only reason you would be jealous is if you romantically cared about him.  And again, ONE date.  So he brings GFs around and is affectionate - isn't that what you're supposed to be with your GF or date? The world isn't all about you and your concerns about having him at the wedding should be a major red flag to your BF since you are incredibly self-centered.", "YTA. \n\nGoing on one date then politely turning someone down isn't rude and considering yourself \"heartbroken\" was a wild overreaction.\n\nBringing his dates to family gatherings is absolutely normal.\n\nThe flirting is the only thing that could be objectively considered a maybe, since none of us witnessed it. But If your husband had to ask if the filrting was happening while he was in the bathroom it's a pretty good indicator that most people wouldn't consider it flirting.\n\nYou're unusually thin skinned and prone to getting your feelings hurt. Look into DBT therapy if yoh want to minimize that.", "YTA.\n\nHe is trying to make you jealous by having a girlfriend? Get out of here with that silly shit. He is just living his life.\n\nYour examples of him flirting are similarly nonsensical.\n\nYour fiance is right.", "Sorry, I think YTA. \n\nNone of this sounds like the brother is flirting with you. He isn\u2019t interested in you at all. If he\u2019s kissing his date or whatever it has nothing whatsoever to do with you.", "YTA. Firstly, nothing you've mentioned sounds like BIL is actually into you and flirting. Secondly, if you honestly believed his behaviour was inappropriate, you should have raised this with your fianc\u00e9 aaaaages ago instead of storing it up for your big reveal moment. \n\nReading this...it sounds like BIL lives rent free in your head and you're not over him. I know it's hard, but you really need to think about this.", "I\u2019m a bit confused. \n\nWhy would he wait till your with your bf to flirt when he had the chance while you were single?\n\nIf he\u2019s doing it in front of bf without comment I have to imagine it\u2019s innocent.", "Absolutely delusional, I wonder how long it takes your husband to realize you\u2019re obsessed with his brother?? \nIf my boyfriend started saying my sister was flirting with him and trying to make him jealous because she told him he looked handsome when coming over and then cuddled on the couch with her boyfriend in front of us, I would immediately assume he\u2019s got a thing for my sister and is obsessively overanalyzing every single interaction with her to the point of delusion. \n\nThe only person that thinks his behavior is weird is you, and you didn\u2019t list any creepy or remotely concerning actions. All I get from this is you\u2019re likely a pretty attractive woman that never learned handle rejection well and to cope with it, you\u2019re reading WAY too deep into any little thing you can to try and cause problems. \n\nI mean come on, it was ONE date, and your husband said it was no problem. Yet.. you still text his little brother saying that you don\u2019t want your \u201cpast\u201d to be a problem. Yikes. Drama seeking much? What past???

He's simply being polite and paying you a compliment as any gentleman would do. You objecting to him bringing his gf along, which is perfectly normal given he's dating her,  makes me think you never got over him. Being heartbroken after just ONE evening spent together is not normal.", "Yta", "YTA \nHis brother rejected you. Now you think any nice words are him flirting...\nHis brother is always going to be his brother. I hope he realizes that before the wedding", "Oh yes you are! YTA! A gigantic and self-absorbed one.\n\nStop giving yourself so much importance that even someone's gentlemanly behaviour makes you think he was flirting with you.\n\nThe fact that your fiance's brother apologized to you, tells you how stand-up of a guy he is. \n\nYou went on one date with him, that too 8 years ago. Grow up and stop being so stuck-up.\n\nKeep this up and you won't have a fiance anymore.", "YTA. \n\nLet's say he truly was hitting on you on these occasions, then you talk to your fiance about it at any time, you don't go from not saying anything at all to saying he can't be at your wedding. That is your fiance's family, he had no idea there was an issue, and for you to go from 0-100 isn't rational or fair. \n\nAnd let's stick with him really hitting on you, what are you worried he will do on your wedding day? He will do what he does in your post- tell you that you look nice (it is your wedding afterall) and then go off and dance and hang out with his family. You don't mention him doing anything aggressive or rude in your post, so the idea he would do something at your wedding makes no sense. \n\nFinally, let's be real here- you are the jealous one. He is bringing girls around you because he is hanging out with his brother, who has also brought a girl around (that's you). Does your fiance not flirt with you, kiss you, or touch you when you are out? BIL is behaving perfectly normal in your own telling of the story. It's pretty clear you created this issue in your mind, and if you don't get it together you won't be getting married, so you won't have to worry about BIL at all.", "YTA and you're going to end up making your fianc\u00e9 question things. This is about as delusional as it gets. You admitted you were heartbroken after one date. Then the guy is nice to you (which is really all this is, unless you're leaving things out), and you are seeing what you wanted to see from him the first time around. How would you feel if he just completely ignored you? He's being polite to the person his brother loves. My BIL is always suggesting things to me when our family goes out to eat, because he and I have similar tastes in food. I do not think he is hitting on me because of that. My advice is this: Drop it. Simple as that. There is no reason on earth not to invite this man to his brother's wedding except to create drama. And yes, he apologized. For making you uncomfortable because he seems like a decent guy, just trying to live his life. Take it at face value, because that's all there is to it, invite him to the wedding and stop obsessing over it.", "It is very clear that you still have some feeling for you soon to be BIL.  You are behaving like a jilted lover and your fianc\u00e9 is starting to see this.  If you can\u2019t let this go, immediately, you will never have a happy marriage.", "YTA the borther said he didn't have a connection. he brings a girl around and pays her attention and you make it about you?", "> I also messaged his brother telling him I did not know they were related in anyway but that I really liked his brother and would like it if he did not let our past together disturb my relationship.\n\nYou don't have a past together. \n You also seem to be overreacting to normal things.", "YTA and you may have just ruined your relationship over this.", "There is SO much happening here. Let's break it down.\n\n1) You went on a date 8 years ago and had a good time. He (politely) rejected you. \n\n2) 3 years later you meet your future fianc\u00e9. You meet his family after 6 months and see the guy you went on a single date with so you tell him to not let your \"past\" together be a disturbance to your relationship.\n\n3) Whenever you go out with fianc\u00e9 and brother, brother tries to include you and make you feel welcome. He (a single man) will occasionally bring a date who he (a single man) will flirt with.\n\n4) You waited until wedding invites were going out to mention your concerns to fianc\u00e9. Fianc\u00e9 is confused because you've been together 5 years and have never brought this up.\n\n5) Brother apologizes for ever upsetting you and fianc\u00e9 is upset.\n\n1) This is your problem. It was one date with 3 years in between the date and seeing him again.\n\n2) You have no \"past\" together. You guys didn't click. It was a blip in both of your timelines.\n\n3) He is not flirting with you if that's all he says. Does your fianc\u00e9 never show affection out in public? If he does, is it to make everyone around you jealous? Is it to make brother jealous?\n\n4) If this really bothered you, why wait so long? You've been together 5 whole years. The way you explained it sounds over the top at best and absolutely insane at worst, of course fianc\u00e9 is upset.\n\n5) Brother sounds like a top notch guy. He sounds polite enough to not string a girl along and include his brothers girlfriend in conversation when going out.

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything.

He and I have been together for 5 years and our wedding is set to take place in this spring.\n\nSo for some backstory, when I was 18 I was on one date with a guy who was 18 too. We went out to dinner and I thought we had a really great time and really liked him. After our date, I texted him telling him I had a great time and I would love to meet him again. He just responded with telling me thanks, that he enjoyed our date but did not find a connection with me and would not want to see me anymore as he felt it would not be fair to me. I really liked this guy and was heartbroken, but I moved in.\n\nThree years later I met my now husband, when I met him I had no idea as to who he was. We hit it off and clicked instantly and fell hard for each other. It was not until 6 months later when I was at dinner with his family and his brother was there that I realized that his brother was the guy I went on a date with. I explained this to my husband, he was fine with it. I also messaged his brother telling him I did not know they were related in anyway but that I really liked his brother and would like it if he did not let our past together disturb my relationship. He responded by telling we that we were all good.\n\nHowever, he has continually flirted with me. When we meet him for dinner, he always flirts, saying stuff like telling me my dress looks nice, that I look great or telling me a specific thing on the menu looks like something I would like. He always does this in front of my husband who has not said a word about this.
