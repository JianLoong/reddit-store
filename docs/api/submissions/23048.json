When I went to do so online, the entire theater was sold out. I was expecting the movie to be big, but I had never seen a complete sell-out before, not even for the Mario Movie. Fortunately, I was able to find a seat in a smaller theater room but even those tickets were extremely limited. It too was entirely sold out except for 3 tickets on Row E and a few seats for wheelchairs.\n\nI was going to the movies alone so I bought a ticket for the chair closest to the end of the aisle, leaving the other two seats directly next to me available. When I get there, I head to my seat, and because I go to this particular theater all the time, I know that it\u2019s always freezing cold, so I brought along a small blanket. In all of the theater rooms except for the ones with IMAX, all of the seats recline. So I had my snacks, my blanket, and I reclined my chair as the credits began.\n\nAbout 10 minutes into the movie, two girls come from the opposite direction and stand next to me. They have their tickets on their phone and they\u2019re looking down at the armrests to see where they\u2019re supposed to sit. Once again, this movie was close to being completely sold out, so the only other seats available were the ones next to me.One of the girls bends over and says I think you\u2019re in my seat. I tell her that I purchased the seat on the end and showed her the ticket on my phone and my seat number. They finally decide to sit down but the first girl asked if we could switch seats. Apparently, her two friends were seated directly behind me and they all wanted to sit together in a block of 4. I kindly let them know that I\u2019m basically comfortable and didn\u2019t feel like moving.\n\nThe other young lady then asked and they\u2019re basically causing a distraction at this point. I simply wave and shake my head no and try to get back to watching the movie, but I can tell that they\u2019re not happy about it. I heard one of them call me an asshole under their breath and they huffed and puffed throughout a good majority of the film.The end of the movie comes. The credits are rolling.

They show up late, accuse you of being in their seat and then want you to move out of a seat YOU paid for anyway?? They're TA!", "NTA you paid for and picked your seat.", "Nah YNTA. Don\u2019t worry at all", "NTA. You bought your ticket online and you got there on time. \n\nYou had every right to sit in the seat you paid for and enjoy the movie. You were not obligated to switch seats with anyone or accommodate their requests. \n\n* They were rude and entitled to ask you to move and to bother you during the movie. \n* They should have bought their tickets earlier or accepted the seats they got. \n* They should have also been respectful and quiet during the movie.", "NTA", "NTA. You went to see Barbie.", "That's exactly what I thought as well but there were a lot of people here all dressed in pink and came as a group, so I imagine that's why the wanted to sit together", "They should have booked at the same time that their friends did.\n\nBased on the seat availability when OP booked their own seat, the two friends in the row behind had already booked their seats. Otherwise OP would have seen those seats as available ones also. So the two that showed up late had already been risking having the seats they wanted booked by someone else. Which is essentially what happened when OP booked, just with one of the seats but not both.\n\nPlus, they knew. They knew going into the theater that someone had already snagged one of the seats they wanted and which seats were theirs. They would have seen it when getting their tickets. So the whole \"you're in my seat\" thing was likely an act.\n\nThey were most likely just counting on the awkwardness of the situation to pressure whoever was in that coveted seat to move. They may even have shown up late hoping that the person in the seat would choose not to argue because the movie was already playing.\n\nOP is definitely NTA.", "Went to the movies yesterday and we found a group in our seats. We picked seats near the top row and their seats were on the floor near the screen, and somehow they sat in our seats 'by accident.'", "I did. It was very trippy at some parts and very self-aware but I did enjoy it. Thank you :)", "NTA   then they should have purchased tickets earlier.", "NTA. They can be annoyed at not being able to sit together if they want, but it doesn\u2019t make you TA for not wanting to move.\n\nAlso I saw the Barbie movie today and also brought a blanket because I get cold! I\u2019d never tried that before and I was so comfy.", "NTA\n\nSuch a ridiculous thing to get ones panties in a twist over!  They'll get over it.", "I'm a huge cinema nerd and it's holy to me. You're definitely not the asshole! They should have just sit where they bought the ticket. They were the ones who disrupted the entire cinema and ruined your movie experience. You'll never get the experience of watching the movie for the first time again and I'm so sorry you had that bad experience. The movie was really amazing I'm sorry you left it with a negative vibe. NTA", "I wouldn\u2019t give up my aisle seat in a movie theatre for anything lol", "NTA \n\nI like them huffing about not sitting next to their fiends- because how would that have changed any aspect of the movie for them? The only difference is that they wouldn\u2019t have the back of their heads in front of them. \n\nSheesh. Some people are WEIRD", "It's like the crap on airplanes when people ask you to switch seats.  Nope, you paid for your seat, enjoy it.  Let the girls complain all they want.  NTAH.", "I don\u2019t understand. Why didn\u2019t you just switch seats? Was the seat you had better or? Maybe this is just some American thing I don\u2019t understand", "NTA, but I would've probably switched making them happier and leaving me the same lol. But blanket etc. I guess it makes a little more sense", "To be fair, I have legit misread the screen the wrong way and thought I was getting back row seats only to realize I\u2019d accidentally snagged front row before. Depending on the theatre, the display is not always clear.", "Or even just arrived on time. A lot easier to negotiate these things with the lights on and without interrupting the movie.", "They weren\u2019t rude to ask - once - and you weren\u2019t rude to say \u201cno\u201d. Then they should have STFU\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThey should have bought the seats together if it was important enough to them to sit together. Instead they decided to be disruptive after the movie already started and they shouldn\u2019t be interacting with each other anyway.", "Nta", "NTA - and Barbie wouldn't think you were either. None of those girls were Barbie approved. It's a sold out movie. All bets are off and people don't have to switch just cause you asked them too", "NTA. They were so used to always getting their way in life that they believe you\u2019re the asshole somehow. I hope they grow up with a more realistic view of reality someday.", "Why does it matter? Because they're supposed to shut up during the movie anyways, right? Or were they planning on being disrespectful and distracting?\n\nNTA", "NTA, their mistake not your problem to fix.", "NTA. \n\nWhy would it matter if they were right in front of their friends? The point is to watch the movie, not talk to their friends. \n\nThis kind of nonsense is why I'm waiting a bit to see Barbie.", "Nta", "NTA. You never have to inconvenience yourself or make yourself uncomfortable for complete strangers. These girls are clearly used to getting everything they want and this was probably a good experience for them."]}
