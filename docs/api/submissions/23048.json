When I went to do so online, the entire theater was sold out. I was expecting the movie to be big, but I had never seen a complete sell-out before, not even for the Mario Movie. Fortunately, I was able to find a seat in a smaller theater room but even those tickets were extremely limited. It too was entirely sold out except for 3 tickets on Row E and a few seats for wheelchairs.\n\nI was going to the movies alone so I bought a ticket for the chair closest to the end of the aisle, leaving the other two seats directly next to me available. When I get there, I head to my seat, and because I go to this particular theater all the time, I know that it\u2019s always freezing cold, so I brought along a small blanket. In all of the theater rooms except for the ones with IMAX, all of the seats recline. So I had my snacks, my blanket, and I reclined my chair as the credits began.\n\nAbout 10 minutes into the movie, two girls come from the opposite direction and stand next to me. They have their tickets on their phone and they\u2019re looking down at the armrests to see where they\u2019re supposed to sit. Once again, this movie was close to being completely sold out, so the only other seats available were the ones next to me.One of the girls bends over and says I think you\u2019re in my seat. I tell her that I purchased the seat on the end and showed her the ticket on my phone and my seat number. They finally decide to sit down but the first girl asked if we could switch seats. Apparently, her two friends were seated directly behind me and they all wanted to sit together in a block of 4. I kindly let them know that I\u2019m basically comfortable and didn\u2019t feel like moving.\n\nThe other young lady then asked and they\u2019re basically causing a distraction at this point. I simply wave and shake my head no and try to get back to watching the movie, but I can tell that they\u2019re not happy about it. I heard one of them call me an asshole under their breath and they huffed and puffed throughout a good majority of the film.The end of the movie comes. The credits are rolling.

Otherwise OP would have seen those seats as available ones also. So the two that showed up late had already been risking having the seats they wanted booked by someone else. Which is essentially what happened when OP booked, just with one of the seats but not both.\n\nPlus, they knew. They knew going into the theater that someone had already snagged one of the seats they wanted and which seats were theirs. They would have seen it when getting their tickets. So the whole \"you're in my seat\" thing was likely an act.\n\nThey were most likely just counting on the awkwardness of the situation to pressure whoever was in that coveted seat to move. They may even have shown up late hoping that the person in the seat would choose not to argue because the movie was already playing.\n\nOP is definitely NTA.", "Went to the movies yesterday and we found a group in our seats.
