How to be a decent human being? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou already lost so much family- Why would you torture your sister? When you are all she has in this world?", "You're supposed to learn from this, not cherry pick the handful of goofs dumb enough to agree with you", "Lmao they deleted their comment you get the point yet?", "I still am on the boat of AH since there's a big age gap, and OP definitely could've been more mature. It is an inappropriate time to fuck with her sibling like that; she should've just been outright and not let there be a misunderstanding. \n\n\nAnd let's not pretend a 24 year old is going to be mature and have the ability to read a situation.\n\nAt the end of the day still AH.", "Me too. Living in Germany doesn't necessarily mean she's German. And OP's behaviour has nothing to do with German humour (or any other kind of humour), it's heartless and cruel to do that to an already traumatized child.\nOP - YTA\nEdit: grammar", "Yeah, I read 24 at first and still thought it was monstrous. Then I saw she's TWELVE?? The best I can hope is that OP's own grief has just briefly completely blinded her to emotion, like a shutdown, and that she gets grief counseling stat.", "I didn\u2019t make a judgement in my comment. I was clarifying a point.", "So when OPs sister is 24 she will no longer be an orphan?", "Just before you deleted you comment I was about to respond and ask you if you read everything (I too read too quickly sometime because people tend to drag things out) because i genuinely couldn\u2019t believe your judgment (also I thought it was weird you said she was an asshole for saying she lied, but not the lying itself) glad to know that was the case. Although I would have said YTA even without the lying part for thinking her sister suffering is cute and for letting her be terrified of being abandoned for weeks right after the death of her parents, just to have someone do your chores", "And I used that cleared point to add to the judgement.", "When the sister is 24 she wouldn't be going into the Foster system if her sister disappeared. Orphan does kinda have a age limit. Would you be calling a 90 Yr old a orphan?", "I was initially under the impression that played along on one night, saying \"I lied\" as an odd way to give reassurance in a light, caring tone. Weird move, and if OP only later realized that her sister genuinely thought she was leaving her, then I wouldn't say that's being an AH. I didn't think too much about this interpretation because the alternative was too wild to see a real human doing.\n\n  \nLike holy crap, knowing from the start that her sister thinks she's moving  away, and *playing along with it??* What?? How can OP know what her sister's scared about, know that she played into it, and find her distress \"adorable\"?", "Fair enough."]}
