It's basically an adventure story told from the perspective of a raptor, and it is SO GOOD.\n\nRandom factoid: The raptors in the early Jurassic Park movies were not actually velociraptors, they were based on a different sub-species called utahraptors, but Spielberg took creative liberty to call them velociraptors since that's the one everyone knows.  Velociraptors were about half that size. I think Blue, in the Jurassic World movies, is closer to velociraptor size. The more you know!  :D\n\n...I completely forgot what the post was about. I got distracted by dinosaurs.\n\nAgain.", "What\u2019s not to get?  She didn\u2019t have to do any housework. That\u2019s all that matters. Apparently.", "When you said you got distracted by dinosaurs, I felt we were kindred spirits.  \nWhen you said \"again\" I knew we are soulmates", "Actually... They where based on the Deinonychus, not he utahraptor. \n\nNow, what where we talking about again?", "Such a good book!", "I giggled way too hard at that.  Mostly because it's true.  I feel like I SHOULD be embarrassed to be a 39-year-old woman with a dinosaur obsession that never faded from childhood, but... I'm not. Dinosaurs are awesome! :D", "I've seen both stated as fact by different people who worked on the project over the years. I think they're kind of a mish-mash of both, with a dose of creative license thrown in for good measure. Either way, they're still cool! :D", "I loved it so much I couldn't bring myself to throw it out, even after I accidentally dropped it in the toilet. One day, I will buy myself a new copy.  \ud83d\ude2d", "Listen, I'm not going to call you an asshole because having a kid dropped on you at 23 is rough. But look at it from her perspective, she lost her parents and now the only person she knows is joking about leaving her. You know that's fucked up. Apologize and take her for ice cream.", "Her parents died.", "Not even a teenager. Teen years start at 13", "Yes there is. It\u2019s called narcissism", "...*are?*", "I'm so glade this is near the top my dyslexic ass brain read the ages as 24 and 21. Seriously who in there right mind does this to a 12 year old.", "True and that's even worse", "I am trying to see how making an orphan cry is funny.  Waiting on the OP too", "OP is also traumatized and become instant mom to her sister. I hope it wasn't meant to be as cruel as it was.", "Yes, I don't understand please explain.", "She wasn\u2019t blinded by grief. She selfishly watched her baby sister bend over backwards cleaning the house out of fear of abandonment. Op is a freaking monster.", "I\u2019m so sorry! I lost my brother August 21st and my grandma on August 27th so I know how much it sucks to lose family back to back. Are you doing ok? I know I have really hard days and some that aren\u2019t quite so hard.  The last few days I feel like running my fist through a wall, I miss my brother so much.  It wasn\u2019t as hard losing Granny she had dementia and it was bad enough she had to be in a home for the last 15 ish years for her own safety.  She didn\u2019t know any of us, didn\u2019t know where she was or who she was for probably the last 12-14 years so honestly it felt like we lost her years ago.  She suffered so much being locked in a prison of her own mind, it almost feels like death was a relief for her.  My brother though he was only 31 and he got ravaged by cancer.  In a total of 7 weeks he went from healthy and happy to in hospice care then gone.  I haven\u2019t been able to accept that yet.  \n\nIf I can do anything please let me know, sending you love and hugs.  I keep telling myself it gets better but I\u2019ve come to realize the pain doesn\u2019t get better, we just get better at accepting it and learn to cope with it.", "\"Hold onto your butts\" I heard that in Arnold's voice, cigarette and all. \n\nHad to check IMDb for the character name. How did I not know he was played by Samuel L Jackson?!?!?! Clearly, I need to rewatch this movie.", "I grew up in foster care. I feel for this kid so much. Especially since I used this strategy to earn my place and still didn't get to stay. OP needs to take some parenting classes ASAP. It wouldn't hurt to see if they can go through  foster parenting classes to really get their head around things. I bet the jurisdiction would allow them to attend if they contacted someone about it.", "Yes, it's hilarious to play on your young sibling's worst fear, after it's **already** come to pass with the loss of their parents.\n\nSomeone get OP a Golden Globe award for Best Comedy of the Year.\n\n/s if I wasn't obvious enough.", "And adorable. OP\u2018s enjoyment is SADISTIC!", "Jurassic Park is such a phenomenal movie. They showed cutting edge tech just starting to be used in excavations (ground penetrating radar) and went out on a limb talking about dinosaurs being more bird-like than reptile-like, which is taken for granted now, but was a really new and not completely proven idea at the time. \n\nI worked at a dinosaur museum for a summer job (Best. Job. Ever.) and I was so disappointed to find out that amber can only preserve insect (or insect food) dna for a couple thousand years. Ice does better, which is why some of the frozen mammoths that have been found are so interesting! \n\n*Coughs* sorry, what was the topic again?", "The image of a kid working so hard to impress the adults and then being ripped away just makes me so sad.\n\nI am sorry for your trauma.", "TitsMcGee, are you from the 80s early 90s? You might\u2019ve found your soulmate and the possibility to create more little Yous with u/VLDreyer", "[removed]", "That's really mean. Your sister thought she was about to be abandoned again. \n\nYTA", "Hahaha what's funnier than watching a little orphan girl desperately try to work hard enough to not be abandoned?\n\nOppphh imagine how your parents would feel if they knew this is how you'd treat your sister. Yta", "> You have the social skills of a velociraptor.\n\nThat is a new one. Thanks for the chuckle. I usually say, \"You have the social skills of a wounded badger!\"", "I don't understand how OP could even have a passing thought that this was funny. It was simply extremely cruel and selfish.", "OH MY GOD I READ 12 AS 21 AND NOW IM UTTERLY HORRIFIED", "I know that there is a stereotype there, but the Germans I have known are generally warm and friendly people.", "oh this is absolutely emotional abuse", "I am fully convinced the only way this could NOT be fake is if OP is an actual, literal demon.", "Sorry, I made a mistake. Let me fix it then.\n\nBut why did you say I was biased?", "I have a similar story, I was 16 when my mom died I had no relatives only for my grandparents and aunt ( mothers side), she she passed away my dad told me it\u2019s just us now that they wanted nothing to do with us a more, it was a whole of being to afraid to call them (before texting) and I thought they just forgot about me untill they just showed up at the house one day and I knew my dad had lie.", "Please don't forget that OP is grieving also. Some people deal with stress through humor. Sometimes, what seems funny at the time is actually cruel.\n\nI am not excusing OP's behavior; just trying to understand it.", "Sadly I'm guessing not if they are living in a small room together what sounds like alone :( heart breaking", "Yes, true, but seriously how could anyone think this was okay for more than a few minutes.", "And 12 year old would benefit from therapy for trauma, grief, and difficulty adjusting to new living situation.", "Not several weeks, as OP stated."]}
