Having lines between work and personal is what helps limit the chance that you might say something like \u201cbitch-ass\u201d to a coworker.\n\nNot rendering judgment on this, just overall making commentary that y\u2019all are way too comfortable with each other to be making comments on dating lives as coworkers."]}
