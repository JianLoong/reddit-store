To any extent what they did was honestly way out of order and HR need to sort it out, regardless as to whether the homophobia was addressed", "NTA.\n\nThat's disgusting of them. I thought they had misread the situation and it would've just been pretty uncomfortable but it's worse than that.\n\nYou were being encouraged to take advantage of her while she drank.\n\nThis already should be an HR problem.

You absolutely were not too harsh, but you should probably consider mentioning this to HR to bring it to their attention.

They made insensitive comments about friends sexuality:\n\n3. They are repeatedly harassing OP, possibly on company time using company devices \n\nThat is a near perfect poop storm of potential risk, liability, and bad PR for the company should it get out and any one of those things is an actionable offense at any good conpany.", "NTA- please let HR know that your coworker basically told you to get your friend drunk and take advantage of her .", "They are your coworkers, they can kick rocks and fuck off about your personal life.

What was this plan?", "NTA. \nFirstly, she took a gamble pre-paying for drinks after her shitty set up plan fell apart. She can't be angry at you for this.  \nSecondly, she either doesn't know you two, or consciously chooses to ignore what she does know - otherwise she would know that you both don't drink and are not sexually compatible. \nThird, trying to suggest that getting someone drunk enough.. ugh.. I can't even finish that. \n\nThe whole situation is just gross, and she is a pretty disgusting person in so many ways. \n\nAlso the other colleagues are filth too. I would not want to be drunk around them either, not a safe situation.", "NTA. But you need to go to HR NOW. This is really bad. They may do it again with someone else.

There are lawyers out there who can help, even if low income.", "You need to go to HR now. Not if it happens again. NOW. What she did was way beyond common sense.

The co-worker tried to set you and your friend up, based on some silly presumption about the way sexuality works. And was way way too upset when you left early. You were way too upset that she tried to set you up with a lesbian. \n\nThat was an awful lot of anger on both sides behind a convoluted \"you two would be good together\".\n\nI guess I'll have to go with an ESH, but even a AITA \"asshole\" is too much for a hook-up that didn't happen.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
