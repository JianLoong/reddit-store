One cousin tried to claim that my sister doesn\u2019t hate kids and she comes over and helps her with her kids all the time and has been a life saver with her newborn.

Nightmares", "\"She's been a life saver for my newborn\"\n\nThat makes me thing how you treated her so she would decline to help if she's helping others. \n\nMaybe you were to demanding or pushy?\n\nAlso not want to babysit does not mean \"hate kids\" \n\nMaybe (not really you do) you owe her an apology", "YTA. There's a huge difference between your sister not wanting to be your babysitter and her not being part of a family event.

You are quite judgmental aren\u2019t you? \nThe event was for family to get together, the fact that she doesn\u2019t have kids shouldn\u2019t punish her.

You sound especially bitter about that fact, as if she should not be permitted to her own boundaries and priorities, simply because she (unlike you) chose not to have her children of her own. \n\nAlso, you invited the grandparents.... Whose kids (ie your and your siblings) are presumably grown. So, this clearly wasn't just an event for parents and their \"kids.\" You just chose to isolate your sister from the event, for reasons I can't fathom, outside of your own entitlement and ego.\n\nYou are right; however, in saying that it is your choice to choose who to invite in your home. But that doesnt mean your family owes you indifference in response to your decisions (as those decisions do not only affect you and your wife).\n\nYour sister also has a right to choose who to invite into her home. And her choosing not invite you is a reaction to something YOU stated.\n\nSo, it's up to you to fix it--not up to her to get over it.", "YTA. It sounds a lot like you and your wife do not appreciate or respect your sister.

And now you arw surprised she hasn't invited you to the family get together she is hosting.\n\nYou, among other things...\n\n- Describe your sister as \"child free\" - this is condescending and doesn't respect her choices. Individuals can like children AND not want their own. She does not have to want to have children.\n- Say your sister doesn't want to help you out - she is not obliged to help you out and give you or your wife a break. You are responsible for the care of your children and arranging alternative care when you need a break. There is nothing in there about inviting your sister to do things WITH your family, just FOR. This is an important distinction.\n\nI think your relationship skills are really not as good as you think they are. Frankly, the fact she has positive relationships and is involved with the other families suggests the issue is with you.

All of my cousins have children except for my sister who is married but \u201cchild free\u201d.\n\nMy wife and I decided to invite all the cousins and their kids over also aunt and uncles so all the kids/grandparents can have a nice day and everyone can be together and all the kids can bond. It was an event meant for parents. \n\nMy wife suggested not inviting my sister because she hates kids so much and never want to be around or help out with our. I agreed we have asked her more times then I can count to watch the kids overnight or for a weekend to give my wife and I a break but she always declines so we figured she would decline this too and did not extend an invite.\n\nWhen everyone was over they kept asking where she was and I told them the truth. One cousin tried to claim that my sister doesn\u2019t hate kids and she comes over and helps her with her kids all the time and has been a life saver with her newborn. She also claims my sister is her kids favorite aunt. Not my experience with my sister getting her babysit for our kids is like pulling teeth she always has something  better to do. \n\nI told them at the end of the day it\u2019s my and my wife choice who we invite to our house. This soured the mood and things got awkward and most everyone left early. My sister found out and is upset she wasn\u2019t included and so is my mom. Now everyone is being distance towards my wife and I. My sister and her husband are hosting thanksgiving and I haven\u2019t gotten an invite yet which is messed up. My event was for the parents and kids in the family thanksgiving is a holiday for the entire family.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she\u2019d been invited and hadn\u2019t wanted to come, that\u2019s her decision. Not inviting her because she \u2018always declines\u2019 to watch your kids overnight is essentially punishing her for not being a free babysitter.", "YTA obviously", "YTA\n\nThis was a family event! If it were truly a playdate for kids that's something else, but you literally invited all the uncles and aunts so that the kids could bond with them.\n\nAs an example as to why you excluded your sister you say: she hates children because she doesn't want to babysit.\n\nWhere is your respect for her? She doesn't want to be taken advantage of by being an unpaid babysitter. She wants her choices to be respected. \n\nShe clearly has no issues with kids or the rest of the family wouldn't have been as shocked that she wasn't invited.", "Yta if everyone has a different experience with your helping them and everyone else things your a asshole chances or your a asshole. Also why would she invite you over if you didn't invite her. It seems no one wants you there.", "YTA. You should have asked her if she wanted to attend. Wouldn\u2019t dream of excluding only one family member. \nIt\u2019s certainly not messed up that you\u2019ve not received an invite to your sisters yet, just like you claim it\u2019s her choice who she invited to her house.", "YTA\n\nSo sister only warrants an invite when it\u2019s to help you out? Looking after your kids? Having them overnight?\n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe you this. \n\nAnd because she doesn\u2019t do you favours like a good aunt should, you exclude her based on assumptions. \n\nSure, invite whoever you want to your home. But don\u2019t be surprised when others do exactly the same.", "YTA. Did you draw the conclusion that your sister hates kids because she had on several occasions declined your \u2018invite\u2019 to look after your kids to give you and your wife a break?\n\nAnd this not invited her?", "YTA and by your logic since your sister is hosting Thanksgiving \u201cat the end of the day it\u2019s her and her husband\u2019s choice who they get to invite to their house.\u201d So enjoy a quiet Thanksgiving with your family and use it as a time of reflection.", "YTA. \u201cFamily\u201d does not mean \u201cpeople with children.\u201d How completely asinine of you to think that adults without children should be excluded!", "You are a massive asshole! \n\nWhat's up with the quotation marks for \"childfree\"? \n\nI bet she doesn't want to babysit your kids because they misbehave or because you're too judgemental. She clearly doesn't hate kids if she hangs out with your cousin and babysits their kids. \n\nExcluding her from an event that was for the entire family because she chooses not to have kids of her own is just messed up. YTA", "YTA. As the childfree aunt, I love spending time with the kids and their families. But I know there\u2019s no expectation, no owing, and I\u2019m being included and also often spending time with my siblings or friends. When it\u2019s babysitting for a night or a weekend - that\u2019s about you not her, and not about your family relationship. \n\nAnd regarding the lack of a Thanksgiving invite, just like you feel justified in having an event for parents and kids, your sister is justified in hosting an AH free holiday.", "YTA.\n\nYou complain she never wants to WATCH your kids overnight, or babysit, or or or\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s not that she she doesn\u2019t want to see your kids or the family.

Maybe cousin invites her over for afternoons, and she has naturally spent time with her kids etc.  everyone seems to be surprised by your assessment of how much she hates kids\u2026sounds like it\u2019s just you, your wife and your kids\u2026.probably a lot more to this story.", "YTA", "YTA. Clearly your wife has a problem with your sister. And clearly your sister isn\u2019t a child hater, as she helps your cousins and hangs out with their kids.\n\nMaybe the drama is\u2026you.

It was a family day right, how is that related to her being childfree? Its not like she was going to start attacking your kids or something lol.", "YTA, wow you and your wife sound extremely entitled nasty people, maybe that's a huge reason why she doesn't babysit for you, and spreading lies that she hates kids because, she wants to choose how she spends her free time, is gross.\n\n\nYou and your wife sounds like if given an inch you'll take a mile, then demand more. Maybe just maybe if you weren't such an AH and expect your sister give up all her free time babysitting (over night stays) and be respectful of her time she MAY help \n\n\n!!!CHILDFREE people are not a default babysitter!!!", "Lol YTA. Serves you right. Your sister isn\u2019t your free babysitter.", "YTA. Just because you raw dogged it doesn\u2019t mean she needs to babysit", "YTA.

You\u2019re allowed to ask her to babysit and she\u2019s well within her rights to say NO and that\u2019s a complete sentence!

I can ask and they can say no - that\u2019s how free choice works.", "Lol YTA. \nI\u2019m childfree too, and I refuse to help watch my siblings kids cuz their are literal nightmares with the poor parenting my siblings put into them.\nHowever I will baby sit other kids because I\u2019m not being drop kicked and screamed at and having things thrown at me, etc\u2026\n\nIt sounds like you have a problem with your sister being childfree and happy. Obviously there is something else going on especially since she\u2019s the fav aunt to other kids in the family and a lifesaver. I\u2019d reflect in why you two have so much bitterness. There is something else going on that\u2019s not being mentioned and I bet it would very much turn the tide on exactly why she isn\u2019t willing to help you out. \n\nAlso apologize to her and your family for being idiots. Obviously everyone loves her and your the problem.", "YTA. Good luck in repairing that relationship. You try to force your sister to watch your kids she says no. It means she has boundaries. You are entitled brats. You and your wife.", "YTA. still ask, even if she really did say no in the end. it's a polite thing to do.", "You and your wife ATA. \n\nYou invited everyone else except for her. Even if she would have declined, atleast she had the choice. Just mean and pretty childish tbh", "Your entitled attitude to \u2018getting her to babysit\u2019 is probably the cause of this problem.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised you are no longer welcome- getting you to include your sister in family events has been like pulling teeth.\n\nYTA", "YTA and a big one, your entire family should go NC with you!!!", "YTA because you started it and she\u2019s doing the same exact thing you and your wife did. Also being child free doesn\u2019t mean being available to look your kids, she\u2019s not obligated to do it.\n\nEdit to add that a family is not made by having kids, family is much more than that. And assuming that not having kids means having nothing going on, just solidify how wrong you are.", "YTA and your disgusting wife is also.  Your sister has absolutely NO OBLIGATION to EVER babysit your kids.  Just because you have trouble getting someone to watch your kids doesn't mean she has to lift one finger to help you out.\n\nAnd it gave me great joy and satisfaction to see that your entire family has given you and your wife the cold shoulder.  You both deserve it.\n\nAnd don't hold your breath for an invite to sister's Thanksgiving dinner.  It's for family only, and it's safe to say that no one is considering you and your wife to be part of the family at the moment.  Better run out and get a turkey before they're all gone.  I just feel sorry for your kids.", "You sound annoying and I don\u2019t blame your sister for not wanting to give into every demand to babysit your kids.\nI am also a mother and i wouldnt treat my family like extra babysitters. \n\nYTA, no wonder everyone left. Good thing you aren\u2019t invited either, you and your wife would probably stir some drama just being there.", "Yta \u2026 in fact  YTHA and so is your wife with the \u201c let not inviting her \u201c because let be honest sounds like your wife has the problem with your sister and you allow it \nShe doesn\u2019t owe your and your \u201c wife \u201c anything . She isn\u2019t obligated to take care of the kids y\u2019all wanted to have . The fact you think something is literally owed to y\u2019all because she is \u201c child free \u201c shows how entitled YOU sound . lets top your entitlement .. Y\u2019all don\u2019t ask for a few hours y\u2019all ask for a whole weekend or overnight.. then are mad she said no \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 .. don\u2019t offer to help her at all because \u201c she has a husband \u201c then are mad because she didn\u2019t invite y\u2019all to \u201c thanksgiving \u201c  it her and her husband house her and her husband rule.. I guess you and your wife should plan on making dinner for your family ( I heard Golden Corral is open )", "YTA. And the reaction of the cousins and their families highlights it. I find it suspicious that everyone else has a different opinion of your sister. This makes me think that you and your wife aren't very kind to your sister. Maybe you judge her for being child free, which would also make you TA.", "You seem bitter.  YTA", "YTA, you and your wife decided to punish your sister for never helping out with your kids. If she was the only family member excluded, that's bullshit.", "Ya YTA 100 percent just being a petty jerk.", "Lollll YTA so much. \u201dFamily event\u201d means you invite the family. Idk about your kids but if they reflect your behaviour no wonder she doesn\u2019t want to babysit your kids.", "LMAO of course YTA. How the fuck can someone be so far up their ass like you? it's a family day, your sister is family whether she's child free or not. I find it amazing that your pea brain couldn't register that.\n\nYeah you and your wife are fucking toxic and that's probably why she refused to help you. Consider yourself no longer have a big family because if they're sane, they're gonna ditch your entitled narcissistic ass and stick with the lovely aunt aka your sister.", "Sounds like your sister doesn't like you, not that she doesn't like kids. YTA. Maybe this is why.", "Reading your comments, you are so out of touch it's laughable. YTA", "YTA. Your sister doesn't owe you watching your kids, you and your wife sound mean.", "Sounds like the only reason you speak to your sister is to ask her to babysit! You are entitled and very much the AH", "YTA. Just because she doesn\u2019t want to be your babysitter doesn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t enjoy being with you guys and being their aunt. This is so different than babysitting; this is an actual family event. She likely distances herself because of how you act and/or view her. \n\nI don\u2019t understand the parents like you who expect help from others. Is it nice? Of course. Is it appreciated? Absolutely because parenting is hard. But they\u2019re your children you chose to have. It isn\u2019t another\u2019s responsibility to look after them. I\u2019m a parent and couldn\u2019t imagine doing this to a family member. I certainly wouldn\u2019t want anyone feeling like their only value is in watching my child.", "YTA. This was a family get together and she\u2019s family. She doesn\u2019t have to watch your kids. What does that have to do with a family gathering. Your wife is being petty and you\u2019re an idiot. Don\u2019t expect an invite for thanksgiving cause it isn\u2019t coming. You and your wife need to apologize and then maybe. You made your bed now you lay in it. This is your wife\u2019s doing by the way. I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s issues between the two.", "YTA - you had me at the start - you\u2019ve really tried to make out she\u2019s a horrid child hater. Doesn\u2019t sound like your sister hates all kids, maybe just yours? Or you and your wife?", ">also aunts and uncles\n\nINFO: Is your sister not an aunt to your children? Is her husband, by marriage, not their uncle? Do you ever include your children's aunt in activities other than babysitting like going to the zoo, a pumpkin patch, *any type of fun family outing*??? \n\nYTA. She is not your personal babysitter, and I am not surprised she would decline if that's the only time you ask her to spend time with your family.", "This one is easy\n\n1. You consider your sister free labor. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her babysitting for free. The problem is it\u2019s your expectation that she drop what she\u2019s doing to watch your children so you and your wife can do what you want. They\u2019re  yours, not hers. It\u2019s that simple. \n\n2. Your cousin told you she doesn\u2019t hate children, you should have shut up then, humbled yourself and sincerely thought about what she was saying. \n\n3. Your wife was being petty and vindictive because your sister does do what she wants. That\u2019s pretty bratty. \n\n4. No one in your family had your back, that\u2019s a sign. They liked you enough to show up but the mood was soured by your behavior, that means YOU did something wrong. You acknowledge they left after you disrespected your sister. \n\n5.

Besides, if she\u2019s that bad why do you want your kids at the child haters house anyway !? \n\nYou and your wife are 100% YTA.", "Troll.\n\nThis hits every box there is, it is fake.", "Info: why is familly day meant for parents?", "YTA \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re basing her disinterest in your kids based solely on her saying no to watching them.\nSounds like she spends time with other peoples kids when the parents are also there.. it\u2019s actually quite scary and nerve wracking to baby sit other peoples kids alone, I have a child and other peoples kids still scare me a bit.\n\nI would be very hesitant to watch someone\u2019s children, especially if I wasn\u2019t particularly used to seeing them a lot. \n\nWhat you did was very cold and I don\u2019t blame her for closing the thanksgiving door in your face.", "YTA. Repeat after me: no one owes me child care. No one is obliged to babysit my children.", "YTA. You clearly view her as a free babysitter and are probably the people who bring their screaming baby on an airplane and take someone else\u2019s seat.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe you anything and you are clearly trying to isolate her.\n\nNo wonder she didn\u2019t invite you to Thanksgiving, and I think it\u2019s rich that you are upset with that, but don\u2019t see a problem with what you did.", "Info there\u2019s a lot of stuff missing here", "yta", "YTA.    Even if she didn't care for kids, you still invite her.   Maybe she doesn't want her own, just wants to  spoil her siblings' children.", "YTA :( Thats not fair. There is a BIG difference between not liking kids and not wanting kids. And its just responsible of her to decline taking care of the kids if she has 0 skills in taking care of them.", "YTA - surely everyone at the parties reaction, rebuttals etc let's your know you're the AH and their actions afterwards let's you know you're the AH. Did you want confirmation from more people who don't love you that you're the AHs because you've done a good job if it is.", "YTA. At first i was inclined to go with the other ruling,  but as you went i realized what an AHOLE  you are in this situation. It seems to me that the only reason you want her around is if she is willing to watch your kids.  Not because you actually enjoy spending time with her.  If i was personally getting that vibe from you,  I'd avoid you too.", "YTA. Its one thing to want your siblings to be free childcare for you and another to invite her to a family event. \n\nSheesh", "YTA. Her declining your request (huge ask, BTW) to take care of your kids overnight or for an entire weekend so you can take time off does not = she hates kids.\n\nYou could have asked her, she had the option to decline. Funny how you're okay with excluding her with the statement that you and your wife have the choice of who to invite to your house,  but when she excerises that same right and excludes you from Thanksgiving,  that is \"messed up\" in your mind.", "YTA, it appears that the only worth your sister has to you is as a babysitter. Not only that, but an overnight and weekend babysitter. That's the kind of babysitting I would do only if there's an emergency and no one else is available. And let me guess, you probably want her to do this for free.\n\nShe watches your other siblings' kids, so clearly you're the problem here.", "YTA it was a family event. You should have invited her. Sounds like you are punishing her for not dropping everything to babysit.", "Yta, no wonder your sister helps out other family and not you. You had a family event and didn't invite her out of spite. Grow up", "YTA", "YTA, \nWhen i do not agree to babysit a particular family member's kids it has nothing to do with the kids and everything to do with the fact the parents agreed to be home at a certain time but didn't come home to until hours later (multiple times).  You are not entitled to her time.", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t an event meant just for parents, it was a family event minus your sister. You can\u2019t cry about not being invited to thanksgiving at her home after you excluded her from your family get together.", "YTA. You should invite people you \u201cknow\u201d will decline, so they don\u2019t feel excluded. Also, your sister doesn\u2019t help with your kids but helps with the kids of others? You\u2019ve left out important information. Either you\u2019re a jerk to your sister or your kids are nightmares. Or both.", "YTA- I mean, it is your home, your choice, but it sounds like you try to use her as free babysitting, rather than doing things as a family. So you're right, you don't have to invite her, but the fact that she doesn't want to be a caretaker for your kids doesn't mean she \"hates kids so much\" that she doesn't want to be near them when their parents are looking after them.", "YTA. The fact your cousin says that your sister is the favourite aunt of their kids and helps out all the time suggests you are the problem. Perhaps if you treated your sister like a human being worthy of respect in her own right and not your personal babysitter maybe you would be having thanksgiving with your entire family.", "YTA and I hope you're alone in Thanksgiving.", "YTA at the end of the day it\u2019s her and her husband\u2019s choice who they invite to their house. And two entitled assholes who think childfree people (no need for quotation marks, it\u2019s a thing) should give up all of their free time to take care of their kids might not make the guest list. You excluded someone for a petty and stupid reason. Your wife was especially petty and stupid with her \u201cyour sister hates kids\u201d. And people don\u2019t like being around folks with those qualities. \n\nYou sowed and now you have reaped. Enjoy your thanksgiving with your wife and your unearned superiority complexes.", "YTA. \n\nWow. The audacity. Your own cousin has a better understanding of your sister than you do. Not wanting to watch your kids doesn\u2019t mean she hates kids. Based on your replies to others, you come off as selfish and self centered. The fact that you put \u201cchild free\u201d in quotations says a lot. \n\nAnyone else think there HAS to be a reason why she\u2019ll help the cousin out and not him and his wife?", "Of course YTA. Everyone involved in this has made it clear you\u2019re the asshole. If everyone else thinks you were being an asshole doesn\u2019t that de facto make you an asshole?", "YTA on a couple of points. Making it a \"family day\" where you invited your cousins, their kids, and their parents if I read correctly; so three generations, but not your sister. Because she doesn't want to take your kids overnight or for a weekend (by your own example), which isn't a normal helping out you could reasonably hope for or ask for by the way, so no invite for her. \n\nThen when other people at the \"family day\" ask why she wasn't included you told them she hates kids because she wouldn't do the above, which they refute by saying she helped them out, so not only have you exaggerated her point but also immediately come into a disagreement.\n\nThen you double down by saying that wasn't your experience with her because getting her to babysit was \"like pulling teeth\" which, with everything we've read to this point leads me to assume you asked her to take your kids for a weekend so you could \"have a break\" (from YOUR kids) then when she said she had plans or couldn't/didn't want to watch your kids for an entire weekend (a completely normal decision) you pushed for at least an overnight, and then continued pushing when she tried to refuse until she managed to negotiate to whatever maximum she was willing to do.\n\nWhen the rest of your family points out that not watching your kids shouldn't exclude her from a family day you double down again and everyone gets awkward, leaves, and then talks about it. \n\nSo far, you are in the wrong several times over. YTA again in case we missed or forgot my judgement.\n\nBut I do want to address specifically when your cousin(s?) said your sister helps them out a lot. Because with the rest I assume one of two things: either they aren't asking for a 2-3 day commitment to babysitting like you apparently are, or you have a much worse relationship with your sister than they do. Thanks to the first few paragraphs of my comment outlining it, I don't need to explain why I actually assume both.\n\nEither seriously reexamine what got you to this point or just do your sister a favor and go NC. If I were her, even from your story (which I expect to be the self-serving version) I wouldn't invite you.", "Babe, it\u2019s sister, not sitter.", "YTA. \n\nYou are right, Thanksgiving is for family; you made it very clear you don\u2019t consider her family. You purposely made an activity to exclude her for not having kids? She is aunt, a cousin, a sister, a daughter (by that logic you excluded your Mom\u2019s kid if we want to go the literal route).", "YTA. I have 3 kids. I also have a sister with no kids. I would **never** treat her the way you've treated your sister. Just because she has no children, that does not mean she doesn't have anything going on, tf? Did you start having kids right out of high school or something? Do you not recall having a life before children?", "Is this a joke? YTA", "So you held a family even and the o lot person NOT invited was your sister? Yup it\u2019s your house you can do what you want. \n\nYour sister is holding thanksgiving, it\u2019s her house she can invite who she wants. \nMage how that works.\n\nAlso sounds like she just might not want to watch your kids. This may be for multiple reasons. Not sure the age of your kids, but maybe they aren\u2019t the best behaved or you only ask when it\u2019s convenient for you. Either way, you need to take a step back and take a deep look in the mirror and really figure things out", "you're the huge asshole here. \n\nwhat makes you think having a kid is your sister's responsibility? why do you think she's child free? SHE DOESNT WANT A KID. and you dropping the responsibility of YOUR KID on her consistantly, makes her want to say no more! who would've thought, being given a huge fucking burden of this literal crying potato that shits would make someone who doesn't want crying potato's that shits, upset? who would've GUESSED? \n\nnot op. \n\nalso, when are you going to tell your sister you don't consider her family because she doesn't want to be burdened with your spawn? \n\nChrist I hope you change.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t asking her to help, you are asking her to watch your kids for days at a time. That\u2019s a vastly different scenario than watching them for a few hours.", "Massive YTA. Childfree people are not here for you as a free resource to use. Even if they\u2019re relatives.

A whole weekend is a big ask, and it seems like they ask frequently. \n\nThe kids could be a nightmare, but even if they\u2019re not it makes sense why his sister wouldn\u2019t want to be babysitting all the time for them.\n\nI think it\u2019s more likely that the rest of the family is more reasonable with their requests:\n\n\u201cCan you help me with the kids for an hour while I do a zoom call for work\u201d \n\n\u201cCan you watch them while I run and get groceries\u201d\n\nEtc. Not:\n\n\u201cCan you watch them for the whole weekend so me and the wifey can go to Vegas\u201d or whatever tf op does lol. He can get a baby sitter for that kinda thing, imo.", "That was immediately my thought as well. My aunt on my dad's side has three children, and my mom would only take one at a time for overnight because they were such little monsters.", "It sounds like the sister likes kids, just maybe not OPs kids. Could it be OP and his wife are raising kids to act entitled like they do and the sister doesn't want to deal with spoiled kids? YTA", "Given what OP wrote, it can be the parents that are too entitled, it can be the kids that are being brats, it could be that the babysitting required is too long or a combination.\n\nOP wrote a few comments about his sister has no kids and has nothing going on so she should be able and should be willing to help him and his wife out, which gives me the impression that he might also ask stuff last minute when the sister already has plans AND OP has his head so far up his own badonkadonk he thinks that there is no way a grown up can have a life outside of raising kids, so his sister should be available at all times. (I'm extrapolating a lot here)"]}
