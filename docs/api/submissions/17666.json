My wife knows that and that was something that she liked about me (being open to express my feelings), up until now it has never been an issue. However her family wasn't as good with dealing with feelings so they aren't as open to feelings. \n\nWell it was my birthday two days ago, we did a very small family gathering with just our closest family and friends since my wife is dealing with some discomfort because of the pregnancy. \n\nMy SIL (f24) came to my party. When she arrived to the house she wished me a happy birthday and gave me a box with a gift, I thanked her and opened it (this was in front of everyone, we were not hiding or anything). It was a book which I honestly love and was looking forward to have for a long time, I had commented this in family gatherings a couple times. I obviously was very happy and excited to finally have it, so I hugged her, I said thanks again and told her I love her. \n\nNo one in my family was surprised, they didn't react at all, but her family did and so did my wife. Even my SIL was shocked. After that things were a bit awkward, like I could tell my wife was pissed over something, didn't know exactly what, and my SIL kept looking at me, so did my in laws. \n\nAfter everyone left, my wife exploited. She call me an asshole for embarrassing this way in front of everyone. I was like what? Because I honestly thought nothing of it, she told me it was because I told SIL I love her and she's very embarrassed because of that. I told her she knows I am open with feelings and I was also very happy for the gift, still she remind me of something we had discussed some time ago regarding her sister and told me because of that I shouldn't have said that to her. \n\nWe argued and she ended up crying because she's hurt and embarrassed. I told her ok and I apologized, but she's still angry. Was I really such an asshole because of this?\n\nedit: since it's important i'll say it here. what my wife and i discussed before about her sister is that my wife's cousin told her my sil has a crush on me, without reason honestly, sil never behaved innapropiately", "created_utc": 1684507029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lxbyd/aita_for_telling_my_sil_i_love_her_after_she_got/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Feels like an important detail intentionally missed out.", "INFO: \"she remind me of something we had discussed some time ago regarding her sister and told me because of that I shouldn't have said that to her.\" what's in the box, I mean what did you discuss?\n\nThis seems extremely key to any decision here.", "I'm going to have to say YTA. You stated that it wasn't just your wife that was uncomfortable, but her entire family including SIL.\n\nI don't think you committed an agregious crime or anything, but you did know how your in-laws are when it comes to affection and expressing themselves.\n\nIt might have just slipped out as we all get used to saying things regularly, but you did make half of the party feel weird, in particular, the gift giver herself.\n\nPeople are often stuck in their own ways and their own perceptions of things. Despite your intentions, from their point of view, you just confessed your love for your wife's sister. I don't personally agree with that train of thought, but with the background, it makes sense why your wife was embarrassed and they all felt uncomfortable about it.", "INFO - some time ago your wife reminded you about -what- with her younger sister?? Hmm?", "From the part about discussion and your answer regarding the same, your wife already told you her sister has a crush on you. Also you know, her family isn't vocal about feelings. So, inadvertently, telling the sister you love her, would be construed by her that you are reciprocating her feelings. Not necessarily, but there is a chance. That's why your wife was hurt over you saying this to her sister, right?\n\nIf this is the case, YTA. Sorry, but from where I stand, you need to consider feelings of recipient to an action too. Knowing well they aren't vocal and what you say can cause awkwardness, you should have refrained from the same. \n\nIt's like, there are people who kiss people they meet as a form of greeting. And sometimes on lips. Just because kisser is comfortable doing that doesn't mean the kissed is. So the kisser should be restraining themselves, if the fact is already known to them.", "Info: do you say I love you to all of your in laws? Is this the first time you've said I love you to her?\n\nEdit to add YTA after assessing OP's response", "YTA! \n\n~~NTA - Platonic love is a thing, good fucking grief.~~\n\nEDIT: Upon new information that the OP effectively hid in the comments, switching from NTA to YTA, because goddamn.  The detail that the sister might be into you is kinda important dude, it changes the ENTIRE complexion of the interchange, especially with you KNOWING that she might be into you.  Very much not cool now, and a bit shady you tried to hide that.", "Yta- your wife told you her sister might have a crush on you.\n\nHer sister goes out of her way to get you something really thoughtful that you have wanted for years and you tell her you love her .\n\nYou can\u2019t be this dense.\n\nHaven\u2019t you ever watched Friends???????\n\nChandler does the exact same thing for his roommates girlfriend whom he is hopelessly in love with.\n\nBuy your wife some fucking flowers and grovel.  \n\nCall your in laws and apologize for  making everyone uncomfortable. \n\nMake things right and remind your wife that SHE is the ONLY woman you love.", "You said that your wife knows you are open with your feelings, and SIL was embarrassed that you said it (possibly in front of others). There seems to be more to the dynamic between sisters that you are leaving out.", "NTA - But dang that's a weird reaction. Makes me wonder if there's more to the story, like some previous abuse to the SIL. I'd ask gently if there's something that would trigger that reaction.", "Edit: YTA. I\u2019m changing my judgment based on OPs comments. Based on the comments OP seems to value his SIL feelings more than his pregnant wife\u2019s feelings. The comments from OP have seriously disappointed me, you\u2019re wrong here  dude.  Saying ILY was unnecessary especially with the history on this one. \n\nMy judgment is NAH, however I think from here you have some things that you and wife need to handle. I\u2019m from a family where we don\u2019t really say ILY very much, we do with immediate but almost never with in laws or extended family.  With that being said I think the family\u2019s, sisters, and wife\u2019s reaction is telling. You mention a convo about sister and don\u2019t specify in the post, but I read the comments and that is huge information to leave out. To be clear I don\u2019t get the feeling that you left it out maliciously but it was a bit of a dumb dumb on your part. From the reaction of the family I think it\u2019s clear that she does have a crush on you. Of course I could be wrong but I think you and wife need to have another conversation about that and you need to stop minimizing it. Your wife (and maybe you with her) need to talk with SIL. I l would also recommend you cool it with the ILY with SIL. From someone with a family who isn\u2019t that affectionate it could look icky. \n\nJust a little tip, maybe keep reassuring your wife a bit more. Her reaction tells me that she\u2019s a bit hurt, idk if maybe there were things in the past with sister or something. Overall you are not an AH though.", "Dude I don't care how open you are, don't hug and  tell a person you love them when that person might have a crush on you\n\nJust don't do it", "NTA, some people cannot see the different ways one can love someone. The way you love your partner is not the way you love your child nor is the way you love your parents. Its all love and this is the first time I have come across someone being upset over someone telling them that they love them. Usually its the other way around.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t telling SIL your *in love* with her. You can love her like a sister. That\u2019s a normal thing to say to family. I tell my BIL I love him on special occasions and stuff \u201chappy birthday! Love you lots!\u201d \n\nYour wife and her family sound like they are seriously emotionally repressed. Once things calm down with everyone\u2019s weirdly heightened emotions over this I would have another convo with your wife to find out what exactly was so embarrassing about it? Was she just embarrassed because of her family\u2019s reaction? Did she feel like you meant it romantically to her sister? Clarify that you love her *as a sister*. \n\nFamilies love each other and you love the people who made your wife the person she is and it was very thoughtful of your SIL to get you the book which I\u2019m sure made you feel like she cares about you too. All of these are platonic feelings of love and totally acceptable. \n\nIf it made your SIL uncomfortable then I would reach out to her as well to clarify that you didn\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable, you just come from an expressive family and you felt like you\u2019ve grown close with their family and have a siblings love for her. It\u2019s not any deeper than that.", "personally I vote NTA, but this is a bit of a weird one. You married this woman, but she still seems son unfamiliar with you and how you navigate your personal emotions. And the fact that it feels like she's trying to accuse you of being into your SIL as well... Little weird my guy, kind of a red flag.", "NTA", "Words of Affirmation is one of the five love languages, and it doesn't have to be a romantic type of love. OP clearly expresses this will all types of relationships with the people they care about. I'm going to say NTA about this for now, but that last portion that is mentioned about a prior conversation that was said about SIL has me wondering what that is about.", "NTA. I get that sometimes people show affection in different ways. My family is very much not an \"I love you\" type, but I know some people are much more open. If someone said I love you to me in that type of way, it might be somewhat awkward for me, but it shouldn't be a party ruining scenario. Is culture a factor here? It shouldn't be that big of a deal and I feel like everyone's overreacting. Unless the thing with the sister is more than her possibly having a crush.", "Yeah we are going to need more information on what you and your wife discussed regarding her sister.\n\nBut for now I'm going with NTA but your wife doesn't seem to fully understand that there are different kinds of love.  You can love someone in a not romantic way or in a family way.\n\nMaybe sit down and gently explain this with her.\n\nHowever, in front of her family going forward it might be wise to limit these types of comments since they are not comfortable with them and may misunderstand. In fact you say yourself your SIL seemed uncomfortable.  Instead you could say--I love the gift or something similar.  We don't want to make people we care about uncomfortable with I love yous.", "NTA. I can understand your wife's family maybe being a little uncomfortable or weirded out at hearing you say \"I love you\" if they don't openly express feelings. But this was clearly about family love and you did nothing wrong. Your wife is projecting her insecurity onto the situation.", "NTA you literally sound like one of the kindest people on here. You said you loved her- how could you be an AH for that?? If my BIL told me that I would be so happy- and he does!", "NTA.  I don\u2019t get her issue, even if her sister has a crush, you are family.", "NTA and I wouldn't have apologized as you did nothing wrong. The problem is with your wife and anyone else. Saying \"I love you\" to someone doesn't necessarily have to have any romantic feelings. Heck, I tell my beloved pet rabbit I love them all the time.  \n\nYour wife has the right to her feelings, and if she's hurt and embarrassed, that's her right. But you did nothing wrong.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nAnd even if your SIL has a massive crush on you, you're still NTA for expressing your BROTHERLY love towards her for getting you a lovely, thoughtful gift that clearly meant a lot to you.  That is not encouraging anything inappropriate, nor expressing inappropriate emotions. \n\nIf anything, it is modeling an appropriate familial relationship and emotional connection to your wife's family, who seem to have lost the plot in that regard. And honestly, your wife's sister is young enough that she deserves to have familial love and enthusiastic expressions of it modeled for her. She's not a child, but she is definitely young enough to still grow and learn from being loved and appreciated in a healthy, non-romantic way. Hell, you're never too old for that.\n\nYou did nothing wrong at all. But the fact that your wife is \"hurt and embarrassed\" by you expressing fraternal love for her sister, which is super healthy and lovely, is really heartbreaking and worrisome. That is NOT a normal reaction, nor the reaction of someone who feels secure or understands healthy expressions of affection amongst family and friends. I would gently but firmly encourage your wife to get therapy.  You expressing platonic or familial love to other people around you shouldn't be making her feel bad or insecure, and certainly not \"hurt\" or \"embarrassed\". She needs professional help and support to figure out why she's reacting that way.", "I think everyone is getting stuck on the part about the thing they discussed, when the truth is that there is nothing wrong with saying an innocent I love you, in front of everyone, after receiving an innocent gift . Absolutely NTA, it\u2019s wife\u2019s family that is emotionally stunted", "Come on dude. We all know what\u2019s going on here. *wink wink\n\nLet\u2019s just say that those videos you watch late at night on the internet - they never happen in real life. \n\nNTA, but geez, keep that thing to yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
