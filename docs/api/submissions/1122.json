OP you are not the Arsehole because I think if your husband would want them you would support them. It is also his right to choose to not want these children. Yes I feel for them, they are innocent in all of of this but going to a home, to a person who doesn\u2019t want them is not good for anyone.", "Nta. Just because the dad wrote it doesnt mean you have to honor it. Funny how you can't abandoned flesh and blood but thats exactly whats shes trying to do....", "NTA.  Bringing children into a home where they are not wanted and loved is not doing them any favors.    He didn\u2019t even know he was set to care for these children, he did not consent to it so he is not responsible.  It is not your responsibility or choice either.  This is his trauma, as his wife and partner you should support his decision, as you are.", "That's what she agreed to do when she took them in.

My husband was so angry when he heard what his father had done. The fact they hadn't spoken in several years, he had never met the kids, but he was willing to dump that responsibility on him.

Sucks that they\u2019ve been put in that position but I\u2019m hoping the kids are at least out of earshot while the aunt is hounding them.", "Nta. The kids are already going through enough. The last thing they need is to be traumatized even more by being a home they know they are unwanted and unloved.", "NTA. You should\u2019ve repeated everything she said back to her. Why is she harassing you. These kids are not YOUR flesh and blood, but it\u2019s hers. Sad that the kids got orphaned but you are making the right choice, you do not want these kids, and they come with a whole lot of painful memories for your husband, it will be very difficult for you guys to create a nurturing environment for them when you know that you do not want them, it might create more trauma as well as they\u2019re bound to realise that one way or the other.", "NTA. You and your husband haven\u2019t done anything wrong. You should only have had to say \u201cno\u201d once and that should have been the end of the discussion.", "NTA, it is a tragic situation but that doesn't obligate your husband to take in two total strangers and take on full responsibility for them.  The estranged father was an idiot to even think this was a good idea, and the aunt is delusional to think it is a good idea to attempt to guilt someone into taking in and raising these children.", "NTA.

Sounds like the stunt an abusive power-tripping parent pulls, when they think that no-one will tell them no.\n\nThe kids are innocent of course, and they have their Aunt.\n\nNTA\n\nGet a restraining order against her if she keeps on harassing you.", "First off...NTA. I can\u2019t say that enough. \nSecondly...auntie doesn\u2019t want the kids and should allow them to be put up for adoption or something. They deserve a home where they are loved. She obviously doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s toxic and is probably doing more damage than anything. They know she doesn\u2019t want them. BUT that doesn\u2019t mean (on any level) that you guys need to take them. Even if your husband had a relationship with them and loved them...it\u2019s still not your responsibility to take them in and raise them. Full stop. Maybe you don\u2019t want kids. Maybe you don\u2019t like kids. It doesn\u2019t matter what your reasoning is...the answer is no one should be forced to take the kids. It\u2019s not a romance comedy where your sister does and you get the three kids, lose your job, fall in love with their principal and live happily ever after bc you found something more important than a career in the fashion industry. That\u2019s not real life. Real life with kids is messy and hard. You two have chosen not to have kids for whatever reason and that should be respected. Even if you did have kids (or wanted kids but were having problems convincing) it\u2019s still ok to not want to raise someone else\u2019s kids who have the trauma of their parents dying.

But why did the aunt get the kids in the first place if she was just planning to foist them on your hubby? Wont those kids realize that they\u2019re unwanted by the aunt bec of this? Tbh hes not obligated since he doesnt know them. And better if theyre raised in a home where theyre wanted.", "NTA- they are her blood too", "NTA, they are not your responsibility and it\u2019s normal that you don\u2019t want to raise them as you don\u2019t even know them.\n\nAlso, big AH your husband\u2019s father for never asking. Not only for you, but he left their own children unprotected because there was not actually any plan.", "No OP you are NTA, anyone who says otherwise should take up the custody of those random kids themselves", "NTA. Those poor children! But there are millions of kids in this world, living in deplorable conditions, and they are not your responsibility either. The nerve of your husband's father, to put him as guardian to his half siblings that he never met, and whose very existence must trigger his bad memories of his mother's death and his father's betrayal.", "So the person who doesn't want to have them, is telling you that you're a bad person for not taking them in your house.\n\nNta, Op. Not your responsibility, it is on you and your husband to decide", "NTA like it says in the comments I suggest you get a lawyer and get a restraining order if she was bothering you. What's your husband's father did to his mother but cheating on her was very cruel of him. And I feel for the children because they lost their parents and they are grieving. But it's your husband's choice that he never forgave his father. And that he never met his siblings. It is your husband's choice that he doesn't want to take the kids. IDK if you have children. You never mentioned if you didn't post. But if your husband doesn't want to take him then you have no obligation. It will suck if they have to go in the system. But what about their mother's family. No one in their mother's family could take it them in. And I'm sure with their parents gone I'm sure they have some kind of inheritance that will help them raise them. Because I know in the States you get death benefits up to 18 for your parents if they die. It's kind of like child support but after your death. I don't know about another country's. But like if you have no obligation.", "NTA.  It's incredibly rude to list someone as a guardian and not even tell them. When we drew up our wills I asked my sibling if they'd be willing to be our kid's guardian before I ever considered listing them.  If they had said no then i wouldn't list them and I'd have asked someone else. I feel sympathy for the kids but your husband is a stranger and bringing them into a house where they would not be loved would be worse for them.\n\nGet cameras to make sure the aunt doesn't try anything.", "NTA, literally everything she said applies to her not you.", "NTA. \n\nIt's perfectly fair to not want to take on these children that neither of you knows. \n\nThe answer was no, and she is now harassing you. She should probably be told in writing that she is not welcome to contact you again, failing which there will be legal action taken. But talk to a lawyer first.", "NTA it\u2019s not super uncommon for parents to pass away. It\u2019s tragic. With that, parents should be responsible enough and care enough about their children to have some sort of plan in the event of their own passing. A plan that involves an informed and consenting party. I\u2019ve seen this happen many times unfortunately. So many people just assume others will take over as parents like it\u2019s some small favor.\n\n Now on top of enduring grief the children have to worry about what\u2019s going to happen to them. I feel for the children. I also understand your and your husband not wanting to take in some children who are essentially strangers. Having children is among the biggest responsibilities a person can take.", "NTA. This is a major rogue life disruption. It's a difficult ask even if you have a well established relationship with children in question for guardianship. \n\nWith the long line of toxicity and dysfunction already in the bucket, I'd also jump ship.", "NTA. Poor kids though. Parents die and no blood family wants them...", "NTA neither of you are obligated to take in two complete strangers. \n\nEven IF you both knew them, you are still not obligated.", "NTA\nYou and your husband are in no way obligated to take these kids, and what she is doing is horrible. The late father is also in the wrong for listing your husband as the guardian without taking to him about it, but those are also not usually legally binding (though this may depend on where you live) so it's really just him saying what he'd like to have happen. Again, you have no obligation to take these kids, and the aunt is harassing you.", "NTA. It's a horrible situation and I truly feel for the kids.   It would be great if they could be in a home with family, and be loved, but it's not your responsibility.   If you're not ready for kids (especially taking on 2 at the same time) then you're not ready.      The father never should have tried to dump them on his son, that he doesn't speak to.\n\nI've spoken to people regarding my kids, who have accepted the responsibility, should something happen.   That's how its done.", "NTA- You don\u2019t put someone as guardian without their knowledge and consent. You can\u2019t force your husband to take kids he doesn\u2019t want. It\u2019s not healthy for anyone involved. His father and AP not having anyone in their lives that can happily take the kids speaks volumes. It\u2019s so unfortunate for these children.Let this be a lesson we cannot burn our bridges. \n\nIm sorry you were lut", "OP I am so sorry this is happening to you and your Husband. This has to be a lot at once. You and your Hubby are NTA. Would your Husband like to form a bond with them? Not raise them, just get to know them.", "NTA. Why can't the aunt not take them if she's so concerned. She's family as well isn't she?", "NTA. You did the right thing. Kids can pick up on feelings from others around them and they dont need to have that feeling of not being wanted. The other family knew about them so they can raise them.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA in any way. That woman is a piece of work.", "These poor children.  Wow.  \n\nNta. You don't want to do anything you don't have to do,  especially taking care of children.  The aunt is flash and blood.  Why is she turning them away? Turn it back on her.  It would be better to find a loving home for them,  honestly.", "NTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t blame him for not wanting to take them. \n\nShe\u2019s the one who should be ashamed trying to discard flesh and blood children onto people who understandably don\u2019t want the children.", "So basically she wants you and him to take care of *check notes* children that share some DNA with your husband? If she comes around tell her there are others with the same DNA is she going to take them in? NTA.", "OP, you are NTA for reasons that others have already stated.\n\nThis whole situation is strange to me. In my state, you cannot simply \"will\" custody of your children to someone; it still has to go to court and custody must be granted. Since you declare your wishes in your will, those will likely be taken into consideration, but it's baffling to me that someone thinks that naming a guardian of their children in a will is the end of the process. That's merely a statement of intent.", "NTA.", "NTA", "nta, sounds like a police report for harassment needs to be made.", "NTA\n\nThe children aren't you or your husband's responsibility.

She needs to stop contacting you both about this.", "NTA", "The aunt doesn't want to raise them anymore than OP, but she also clearly does not want the children to end up in foster care. I have some sympathy for the aunt as she at least has some for the children. There is no good solution to this sad situation, and she will likely end up resentfully raising her niblings. Her world has also been turned upside down.

Nobody has the obligation to raise them, but shit, your parents die suddenly and violently and the whole family is arguing on who doesn\u2019t want you the most?

I hope those kids are ok.", "You are not TAH *but* you could be A LOT more kind and compassionate in the way you respond to the Aunt and the way you talk about the children.  I\u2019m sorry for any pain this is causing your husband emotionally .  Your husband knows what it\u2019s like to lose a parent at a young age .  His siblings lost both parents.  He might consider that Meeting them (not fostering them) may be a way for them all to heal together and have some security of a family bond . He could see to it that they are placed in a good home and even visit them periodically if foster family allows .  I understand you don\u2019t want to foster them but to just block them out seems harsh .", "Nta. But everyone else is from the deceased to the aunt and your husband", "This is a heartbreaking situation and it would be good for your husband to get to know the kids.

As heartbreaking as the situation is, the kids and your SO (also, yourself) have no relationship aside from biology.  To be pawns, in whatever game the aunt is playing, is disgusting on HER part. His father made decisions that firmly prevented a relationship from being formed.\n\nI hope your SO has gotten some therapy for his feelings towards his mom's passing and the betrayal brought on by his father and mistress. Cheating already sucks. To do so while your spouse is terminally ill is even worse. \n\nI am so sorry y'all are going through this. I couldn't imagine being in your situation. This has got to be, not just frustrating, but extremely hurtful to your SO.

It\u2019s not heartless to not want to raise children you don\u2019t want a relationship with and did not choose to have.", "Aunt alert!", "DNA =/= family", "Apparently, though, the aunt does know the kids, and she's also their flesh and blood.  If she's so adamant that they need to be raised by relatives, she's perfectly free to raise them herself.", "No, they aren't his family. This bs about \"flesh and blood\" doesn't mean a damn thing. Family is about who was there, who ACTED like family. Its not just about blood. You're off your rocker if you think blood is enough reason for him to take in children he's never even met. Both my parents are adopted so I'm not blood related to 98% of my family. Doesn't make them not my family. My estranged mother abandoned me and had 2 more kids. Those kids are not my family. I've never met them. I would not take them in. And that's okay. Keep your moral blackmail to your damn self.", "We share like 80% of our DNA with cows. Are cows our siblings too?", "Them being siblings does not mean he owes them anything. Not sure what you're not understanding here.", "He doesn\u2019t know them, because they aren\u2019t his siblings. They are the children of the man who cheated on his mother. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to claim them. The beauty of being an adult is you get to choose your family. I have lots of people I\u2019m related to who aren\u2019t my family. I\u2019m sure most of us do.", "He shares about 50% of his DNA with them, he also shares about 60% of his DNA with a banana so should he adopt a bunch of bananas?", "Probably is the aunt, op and her husband have thr right not to take them in There are strangers  to them.", "I mean they can - but it can\u2019t be enforced so they shouldn\u2019t", "Yes they can. I can write in my will that the current sitting president gets custody of my children. I don\u2019t have to inform them of this. But if I did the executor of my will has to contact someone in regards and tell them the current sitting president has been assigned guardian of my children if I pass...and I passed. Now the president had the right to say yes or no. But yeah...I could designate anyone to be the guardian of my children.", "yes he is, we could go back and forth indefinitely.\n\nyou support selfishness, i support generosity. \n\nthey are not my family they're his . and i take care of my family.", "Moo. (And NTA, obviously.)", "And 98% with chimpanzees. Perhaps I should have adopted a chimp instead of a cat because, well, siblings.", "I keep adopting bananas, but they always abandon me so quickly. One day, they\u2019re happy and yellow. And the next, they\u2019re soft, black, and stinky.", "I frequently adopt a bunch of bananas...Just doing my part", "That's what I meant, guess I should  have been more literal", "Family doesn't include the children of a woman who had an affair with a married man while his wife was dying.", ">and i take care of my family.\n\nSo if some stranger showed up on your doorstep, and proved through a DNA test that they're your secrect half sibling, you'd be obligated to take them into your home and care for them immediately because you'd be selfish otherwise?", "If you want to be so generous, than you take them, literally, contact OP and tell her to let them know you\u2019ll take them\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll say they\u2019re not your family. Well, guess what, they\u2019re not theirs either. You choose your family. While often blood related, not always, such as kids adopted by strangers.", "Nah they're not his family either", "It\u2019s not generous to take responsibility for children you resent. It\u2019s dangerous.", "No he is not and you are just nuts!", "But it\u2019s not selfish. They are strangers. You don\u2019t have to open your home to strangers.", "Go on with your generosity and adopt kids needing homes.", "It's easy to be generous with someone else's time. OP cut his father out of his life, they were not family. The kids his father had after their estrangement that OP has never met are also not his family.", "I mean. We\u2019re supposed to share 90% with cats, so I think that\u2019s still close enough?", "They grow up so fast", "Oh sorry LOL. Just to clarify I have spoken to those I plan to leave my kiddos to if something were to happen...and it would never be a president (past, present or future LOL).", "I did the same"]}
