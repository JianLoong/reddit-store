Beat it. \ud83e\udd23", "NTA for throwing your bf's sister out of the party. \n\nYou might have handled it a bit better, especially if some of your friends heard her accusing you of cheating on your bf. You should have kept your cool and just told her to leave. If she had tried to cause a scene - and she would have tried to do just that - your friends could have escorted her out. Your friends could also have told your bf what they saw and heard, backing you up.\n\nOf course, don't invite your bf's sister to anything any more. If you and your bf find yourselves around her, make a point of inviting him to your next party.", "NTA, glad he seems sane.", "I'm going with - she was drunk or high or just insane?", "my boyfriend doesnt need an invite to show up but even then i've given him a general invite, he can show up whenever he wants. most of my friends know this but they're already familiar with him & know he's not a party person", "I dated a guy years ago with a pot stirring/crazy family. omg. So happy to not know those people anymore. Always had to have drama.", "I love it when people show themselves early in a relationship. Now OP knows to cross the sister off her BFF list and keep it moving.", "What", "NAH then. Yalls relationship dynamic does seem a bit strange, but if you and BF are truly on the same page about your party life, then there's nothing wrong with that. Still, by I could see why bf sister would think something is amiss. Is there more going on than you've let us know? Unless not, this seems like a good opportunity to clear up any misunderstanding. You would be an ah if you enable your boyfriend to sabotage his relationship with his family over something so minor.", "my boyfriend encourages me to throw them if it makes me happy. we talked about it and i told him that i would apologise to them but he refused. he said he'll deal with them himself. to my knowledge i havent really done anything to make them dislike me? ever since we've started dating they haven't been exactly fond of me because \"having a girlfriend would distract him from his studies\", or something like that. they've always been a bit invasive(?) which is why my boyfriend established boundaries with them just a bit after we started dating. \n\ni still don't know why his sister would accuse me of cheating though. i'd assume it's because of my party life but i dont understand why she would have doubts about me when my boyfriend doesnt", "Gotcha. Makes sense if his family has a history of walking over your bf. You're definitely NTA then", "NTA for kicking her out. You're not really making a good impression on them though. They're already concerned that he won't focus on his studies and you throw parties every other weekend it's a bit much. But hey if it he doesn't care his sister shouldn't either or at the very least she should take her concerns to him.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to mind the business that pays her. You have done nothing wrong. It isn't that he wasn't invited, just that he doesn't like parties! Like, think logically. Why would you not invite your bf but still invite his sister??? Does she think you're that stupid?\n\nShe was the drunk A here. not you.", "If his family chooses to believe sister without getting the other side - there was not much of a relation to be lost to begin with.\n\nGood news - he has your back, he is supportive - and that is a good thing to have\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "I'm not even going to say it's weird. Unconventional maybe, but I'm actually jealous of how well your relationship dynamics are working for you. You have different interests, respects each other's, and are happy and secure."]}
