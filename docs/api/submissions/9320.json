Luckily they have no children and no combined ANYTHING, bank accts etc. We gave them $2k for their honeymoon, which is fine but I want to ask him to get the diamond back, she can keep the ring itself but after dedicating less than 2 years to a marriage, I don't feel it is fair for her to keep the stone, esp when she never even wore it because (even though she picked out the setting) she decided it was just too big and gaudy.\n\nSo... Am I The Asshole for wanting HIM to ask for the Family Diamond back?\n\nEdit: To clarify, I haven't said anything yet, mom doesn't know the divorce is coming and I anticipate her thinking of this too.  My plan was to ask Son, in a couple weeks once the shock and some sadness has warn off, to ask for it. I won't get involved unless it comes down to outright PAYING her to get it.

Be super sweet and wish her well, maybe take her out for lunch at a place local to her parent's house and talk about how she's feeling, what she plans to do with her future, etc. If DIL doesn't feel threatened, it would increase the chances of her giving the diamond back to grandma.
