I wasn't used to a man being in the house, it's only been me and my mom for years so it was a bit weird. Me and Ted have a pretty awkward relationship. We don't talk much but when we do, it's very very awkward, like we have absolutely nothing in common. According to my mother, he's very socially anxious and \"scared\" of me so he always stayed inside my mom's room whether she was there or gone. He never ever came out. The only place he went to was the bathroom.\n\nWhenever my mom wasn't at home, she'd leave me to cook, and serve Ted food. Yes, \"SERVE\". I didn't mind at first because as my mom said, this man was socially awkward. But having to serve him breakfast and lunch while he remained couped up in his room got on my nerves really quick. Within a week of this \"arrangement\", I asked my mom to tell Ted he could come out of their room once in a while and get familiar with me and the house. In vain, Ted only came out once before couping himself in the room again.\n\nAs always, my mom left me to serve him but I was pretty much fed up with whatever this behavior was and ended up arguing with my mom and I ,maybe a bit too loudly, said I'm not his fucking servant and he should man up and walk around the fucking house without being afraid of his soon to be 16 year old stepdaughter.

As she put it, she didn\u2019t want her bfs to become accustomed to being waited on by her daughters (or her for that matter) and start to look at it like a plus to the relationship because the relationship (companionship, intimacy, humor, new experiences together) should be the only plus he\u2019s looking for. She also made a concerted effort to have outings with us and her bf (and their kids if they had any) so we could actually bond together instead of awkwardly having to break the ice with them alone.

You are a student with classes.  Why should your class time revolve around catering to him?\n\nAs for mom moving a strange man in, first she should have checked him out online.  Way too easy to find out if he is a predator.  If you know his first and last name, approximately how old he is within 10 years and the state you live in, anyone can look him up for under $5.  PS. Ned is sometimes short for Edward.  Two, did they have any interaction before he moved in? Did mom and the boyfriend take you to have meals out, activities together, to let the two of you get to know each other?  Or was it just \u201cHey, this is Ted.  He lives here now.\u201d  No reason for him to be there and for you to serve him meals in a bedroom.  It makes you uncomfortable and mom shouldn\u2019t expect that.\n\nWhile my parents got married after six weeks and were happily married for over 60 years, it was a different time with different standards.  They didn\u2019t have kids to involve.  Not the same now between computers to get backgrounds from, more awareness of children\u2019s feelings, and usually longer dating times for parents!

It would be totally different if he was a guest and just staying for a few days or if he had a disability or something, but since you guys are going to be living in the same house(I'm presuming) after they get married, he should learn to interact with you. He should know that if he's marrying a single mom he should be willing to deal with her child too and not just hide away in a room.

It is typical for single parents not to introduce people they are dating to their kids until they are sure it will be a long term thing.  You need to sit down and write things out so you can have a calm discussion with her.  Examples: 1) You aren\u2019t comfortable with her moving a man in you just met and that she should have taken that into consideration.  2) That it feels like they are moving awfully fast and it would be more comfortable for you if they would slow it down a bit.  3) That obviously she is free to marry whom she wants and can wait on them hand and foot if she choses, but you did not chose to be in a relationship with him and are not his servant.  4) That her moving him in so fast is doing the opposite if fostering any sort if relationship between the two of you.  You should not feel bad at all, your mother put you in a horrible situation.  Do not fall for any guilt she may throw about wanting her to be alone.  This has nothing to with them not having a relationship, this is entirely about how she went about introducing you a month ago, getting engaged that quickly, and moving him in so fast that it caused you whiplash.  Ask her what she would think if you did that, date for three months, introduce him after two months and then get engaged?

If dude cannot make his own food, he either has some disability, which I don't think he does, or is playing a game on you as well as your mother. Your mom will not see this game, she's been blind sided by \"love\" or even loneliness. My advice is to be weary of this person. I just mean you to be cautious and possibly vigilant, but in keeping the \"day to day\" intact. Document anything you feel is \"off\" to you. If nothing comes of it, cool!

Regardless, he should not be treating you as a servant and it's okay for you to express your discomfort with that arrangement.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, it's understandable that tensions are high in this situation, but it's important to communicate respectfully and find a way to move forward that works for everyone.
