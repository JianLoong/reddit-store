Most of it having to do with her relatively new bf/fiance, Ted (39). I have been very supportive of their relationship even though I had my concerns when they got engaged within 3 months. I've only known him for a month now since my mom hid him for the first 2 months. Weird.\n\nLately he's been sleeping over at our house, a lot. I wasn't used to a man being in the house, it's only been me and my mom for years so it was a bit weird. Me and Ted have a pretty awkward relationship. We don't talk much but when we do, it's very very awkward, like we have absolutely nothing in common. According to my mother, he's very socially anxious and \"scared\" of me so he always stayed inside my mom's room whether she was there or gone. He never ever came out. The only place he went to was the bathroom.\n\nWhenever my mom wasn't at home, she'd leave me to cook, and serve Ted food. Yes, \"SERVE\". I didn't mind at first because as my mom said, this man was socially awkward. But having to serve him breakfast and lunch while he remained couped up in his room got on my nerves really quick. Within a week of this \"arrangement\", I asked my mom to tell Ted he could come out of their room once in a while and get familiar with me and the house. In vain, Ted only came out once before couping himself in the room again.\n\nAs always, my mom left me to serve him but I was pretty much fed up with whatever this behavior was and ended up arguing with my mom and I ,maybe a bit too loudly, said I'm not his fucking servant and he should man up and walk around the fucking house without being afraid of his soon to be 16 year old stepdaughter. So Ted might have heard this because he left pretty early and hasn't come to visit in a week. Me and my mom haven't been talking much since.

If Ted wants to eat, the very least he can do is to sit down at the table, where food is normally being served.

It is ridiculous, bordering on inappropriate.", "NTA I\u2019m a mom, and nothing about this is okay. This guy is all red flags, and you were 100% justified. I would NEVER have introduced you so early, allowed him under the roof with my child, or gotten engaged to someone I\u2019ve known such a short period. Her relationships should be ENTIRELY separate from you until they are well established.", "NTA. Your mons midlife crisis is not your responsibility.", "NTA.

It's also frankly alarming that she was fine moving a man she just met into her home with her teenage daughter.", "NTA. This is WEIRD behavior on Ted\u2019s part and is throwing some major red flags if I\u2019m being honest. What is your mom thinking? For your sake, I hope he never comes back. Something\u2019s not right.", " NTA\n\nyou\u2019re a teenager, not a maid.", "Absolutely NTA. You are 100% correct - his 'issues' should not become your problem. He's too anxious to get to know you but feels comfortable with you serving him? Red flag.", "NTA- beyond the serving him, my major concern is why your mom thinks it\u2019s reasonable to move a man in to your home that you barely know, then often leave him alone with her 16 year old daughter. If she wants to move a relationship along quickly, that is her business, but not when it messes with a child\u2019s living situation.

Why is he even at your house all day when your mom leaves? There is so much wrong with this I don\u2019t even know where to start.

He is 39. If he can't interact with you and serve himself, he shouldn't be having relationships with women who have children. Your mother is trying to make you coddle her boyfriend, and that is not okay.", "NTA.  It's inappropriate that your mom leaves you alone in your home with a man you barely know alone.  It's potentially dangerous to you.  It's weird that he is there when she isn't and that he hides and refuses to take care of his own basic needs.  It's unacceptable that you're expected to cook for and wait on him.  Who cares if he heard what you said?  You are 100% right.  Ted shouldn't even be there, and his social awkwardness is no excuse.  Let him got back to his own place where he can act like an adult and feed himself.", "Your mum got engaged within 3 months which in itself is concerning.

To add to this ridiculousness, she asks that you make his meals and deliver them to 'his' room.\n\nIt doesn't matter how desperate/lonely she is...she's displaying very trashy, irresponsible parenting. \n\nYour impression is right - this man is weird, awkward and probably mentally unwell...if he has that much anxiety around a teenager whose mum he is engaged to, he belongs in a psychiatrist's room, not in a relationship. \n\nYou have nothing to feel bad about. It's your mum who should be feeling all types of ashamed.", "I'm so confused. \n\nINFO : Are you in school? Or is this a vacation or break? Why are there many moments when you.

It's timing I guess. \n\nHear me out... You are a child, so there's no reason you should be doing all this. But if you were so against his behavior and social awkwardness, you could have talked to him yourself, opened dialogue, etc. I am say this because you seem to be a direct person.

This is very strange behavior on his part and very concerning behavior from your mom.  I would be very leery about your home life if they actually get married. Do you have grandparents or other family close by that you can move in with if things get worse with this arrangement?", "Definitely NTA\n\nI would've said the same thing.\nYour mom is an enabler. Don't do what your mom does; it'll only encourage the behavior... presuming he even comes back.\n\n He'll either get hungry enough to leave the room to make his own damn food, or he'll go without.\n&, Honestly, if he's really THAT BAD, he may need professional in-patient care with a full team of doctors specialized in his specific disorders (if any)", "NTA .Something is very off here.1.

What almost 40 year old can\u2019t fix their own food?\n\n4. What could he possibly be doing in that room all that time?  \n\nHe\u2019s weird. Maybe he really does have a lot of social issues but rather than expecting you to cater to him perhaps he needs some therapy.\n\nEdit:  My other concern is your mom. How the heck is she comfortable moving this guy in and she\u2019s only known him 3 months!  Totally inappropriate behavior on your mom\u2019s part.", "NTA. this is embarrassing on his behalf and he should be able to responsibly cook by himself unless he is severely disabled.", "NTA. He's a grown man. He should be cooking meals and calling you down for dinner. That's what I would do. Social anxiety? Scared of YOU?\n\nI think there is a reason why mom hid this guy from you. She KNEW he was going to passive-aggressively protest the fact you are in the picture. This is why he hides away from you when mom isn't around.\n\nMom needs to find a guy who is okay with the two of you being a package deal, or otherwise wait until your out on your own.\n\nI would never make my partners 16 y.o. kid feel this way.\n\nHe doesn't sound like he has mental health issues. He sounds immature and manipulative. If he didn't want to be around someone's kid, he should not have dated and then moved into a house with a woman who has a kid. *Period.*\n\nYour mom (and you) deserve better. A man dating your mom should at least respect the fact you two are a package deal.\n\n>It seems a bit childish to me but I also kinda feel bad.\n\nOf course it seems this way. You're the only one in that house acting like an adult. Your mom is dating someone who she (on some level) knows is not into a woman with a teen-age kid. And the \"man\" is acting like you're some unwanted room-mate or border. How did she expect this to work out?\n\nI really don't like parents who put their kids second to their new relationship. Yes, she has needs and desires a relationship (which is fine)  but a parent should be a parent FIRST and any new partners need to be good for the kids involved.\n\nTotally NTA. And your mom needs to get her priorities straight.\n\nAnd maybe pick someone more mature next time. Lots of men are out there who would have no issues at all dating a single mom and being *respectful to her children.*", "ESH. \n\nTed can make his own food. \n\nHe is also allowed to have anxiety and cope with it in private. \n\nYour mom was perfectly fine keeping a new man from you until she felt she could trust him around you.

Your mom's relationship is moving as fast as a middle school relationship", "And how is this guy there at their home all day everyday? Does he not have a job or what? Just expects to be served breakfast and lunch in bed by the kid whose house he\u2019s squirreling himself up in? It\u2019s too weird. Plus, mom doesn\u2019t really know this guy very well. This is a huge parenting fail.", "If you live in the US you can check to see if he's a sex offender. I know that information is open to the public. It's good information to know in general.", "OP NTA but this is a really concerning situation. Your mom is being completely irresponsible for your safety, ultimately she doesn't even know this guy, you certainly don't and she's having him stay at the house alone with you. I can't think of anything good when ppl get engaged so quickly and he's not making an effort for you to get to know him. \n\nWas it your mom's idea for you to cook for him or his? Ultimately it doesn't matter bc he won't even come out to have a meal with you to try to get to know you but if I were you I'd get his full name and try to get his birthday and do some records searching online to see if he has a criminal background, someone mentioned maybe he isn't allowed to be a room with a minor but if that was the case he wouldn't be able to be in a HOUSE with a minor. \n\nTrust your gut and keep away from him.", ">Does he not have a job or what?\n\nCould be he has a \"work from home\" job and is using the internet. But yeah, it is really weird in general. I don't get how someone with social anxiety would decide to get married with someone who has a teenage child after just 3 months of dating, and moving in with basically strangers. Being socially awkward, yeah, I can understand *a bit*, them not realising it's really fast, but would you do that when you have *anxiety*? Also:\n\n>mom doesn\u2019t really know this guy very well. This is a huge parenting fail.\n\nDefinitely.", "That's a good idea. Also, if in the US, check out your county and adjacent Clerk of the Court websites to check his criminal history. Maybe he has warrants, etc. And, if he's that anxiety ridden and socially inept, how did he meet your mom?!"]}
