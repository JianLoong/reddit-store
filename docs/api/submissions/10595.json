We don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with her and have no where else to go so I\u2019m taking care of the both of us until my mother comes home. \n\nMy brother has mental disabilities and so he cannot take care of himself (even though he\u2019s physically 17, he\u2019s mentally a like a child). \n\nFor the last few days, I have bathed, fed, provided his medicine, and just watched over him by myself. I\u2019ve called my mom for guidance but there\u2019s only so much she can do. \n\nOur house isn\u2019t the cleanest, even before this, but messes have never really bothered us. \n\nAnyways, my older sister (mid 30s) came over with my nephew (17m) to pick some things up for my mother. I had it pre-packed and planned on handing it to them but they came in and just snooped. They took some of our food (claiming it\u2019s for my mother but she doesn\u2019t really eat the stuff they took, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s for them) and just went through places. \n\nThey took random pills, started investigating me on if I knew what pills my brother took and if I was writing everything correctly (I was), they went in my room AND bathroom, and then tried telling me to take initiative and clean up some. \n\nI\u2019m upset because I\u2019ve been taking care of both me and my brother full time with no warning and they want to lecture me on if I kept my house clean??? I went from only caring about myself to having to care for my brother and just the worry on what\u2019s wrong with my mother.\n\nOnce she left, she told me she\u2019ll be back tomorrow and expects a clean house. I told her she can come and clean it if she expects that so badly. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t responded and I basically intend on locking her out and ignoring her calls if she comes over. Is this something I should do or should I get off my high horse and just clean?? \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t take too long and honestly probably sounds stupid; I\u2019m just a really stubborn person and hate the way she talked to me.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the advice. And to just clear some things up, I\u2019m homeschooled/online now while my brother goes to a public school (it has resources that help him!) I have no idea what specific pills she took, all I know is she walked out with them and I never saw the name. She took 3 bottles from what I remember! I also have money in case we need food or anything else.
