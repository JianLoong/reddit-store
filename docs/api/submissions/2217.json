We were on a bit of a busy campsite for 3 nights. The last night there was a big party because of the ending of the camping season, but we decided tot stay at our van and chill a bit. We went to sleep around 12 and put our earplugs in to go to sleep. Some 10 minutes in we started to hear a child cry. At first we were a bit annoyed, but the child kept crying and after 20 minutes he started to cry \"help\".\n\nSo I went outside to look what was happening and figured it was coming from our neighbour's tent. They had a tent and a van, but the crying came from the tent. I felt a bit awkward about entering a strangers kid's tent, so I went for the van first. The door was half open and I knocked and called for help, but there was no reaction. After that I decided to look ib the tent, where a three year old boy stood crying in a little pop up bed.  My gf reached out to calm down the panicked child and I found another couple that were sitting outside there van and asked if they knew the parents. \n\nSo at that point we left the boy with my girlfriend and me and the neighbour went to find the parents at the party. We found the father who was, as he claimed, 'raving' and brought him to the boy. The mother was apparently so passed out (from drinking?) that she did not wake up in de van from the crying and me knocking on the door. The dude went in to wake het up and apologised for the inconvenience. He seemed a bit annoyed though, as if it was our fault that we disturbed his evening.\n\nSo all is well. Boy went back to sleep, father could 'rave' again. The weird thing was the next day, when they completely ignored us. Non of them came to say thanks or anything and they avoided us like the plague. We somehow got the vibe from them that we shouldn't have done what we did. \n\nSo are we the assholes here?", "created_utc": 1668347917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu2f45/aita_for_breaking_in_a_strangers_tent_and_take/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did everything right. You haven't even been accused of being an asshole. The parents are probably embarrassed. Maybe their memories are too hazy for them to recognize your face.", "NTA but this needs to be reported to child services for child endangerment. Neither parent was parenting their child and they just left him in a tent in the woods. What if he ran away trying to find his parents or someone who didn\u2019t share your good intentions found him first?", "NTA. There ignoring you Bc they are embarrassed. I would have called the cops personally.", "NTA at all but the parents most definitely are. Leaving a 3 year old in a tent so they can rave and get drunk is just awful.  Poor wee man must have been terrified. If you have their details I'd definitely report to whatever your child protection services are.", "NTA next time call the police if you find a crying child all alone. This is child endangerment and I am afraid the parents will continue to do this until someone else does something. That child could have been kidnapped if you weren't a  kind honest person.", "NTA\nCall child protective services.  They can go overboard, but a 3 year old would not be left alone while the parents are getting drunk/high. This is child abuse. The emergency line is made for stuff like this. They can get people out pretty quickly (since the immediate danger is gone they may not be as quick).\n\nNever the AH for protecting a child.", "NTA. The parents are probably afraid you\u2019ll inform the authorities. Child abandonment is a crime.", "NTA wow! Goggle \"Cleo Smith, Carnarvon\" those parents are are irresponsible! Anything could have happen to that kid!", "NTA, but I can't believe someone would let the kid suffer like that while they black out. I like to drink too, but my guy comes first.
