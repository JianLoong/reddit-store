It was very hard for him and while I've always been there to help him, my wife and I felt that having a therapist would be best. He seems to be making a lot of progress, so I know it's working.\n\nUnfortunately, my bil is a men shouldn't express emotions kind of guy. I've always thought that was bs, so I made sure my wife and I were on the same page about not letting that happen.\n\nLast night there was a family gathering. My son had just had his therapy session, so we picked him up and drove there. While we there, my son was telling me about something they talked about, and my bil must have overheard, because he started on a tangent about boys not needing therapy and calling him a girl. I probably wouldn't have reacted as much if my son hadn't been there, by my son was visibly hurt by what he was saying.\n\nI was pissed at him and told him to F off and that right now my son is more of a man than he is. I would have liked to say more, but I didn't want to upset my son further. I admit that I might have gone a little too far, but I was defending my son. But I don't think someone who shames someone else for being healthy while also being sexist is being a \"man\".\n\nMy bil just glared at me and stormed out of the house. My wife told me that we were leaving so I got my son and we left. My son didn't say much the rest of night, but my wife sure did. She was mad at me for doing that, and saying I disrespected her brother. I tried to explain I was just defending my son from him, but she wouldn't take it and is ignoring me.\n\nI'm still mad over this. My son was shamed for expressing his emotions and then everyone gets mad at me for defending him. But all of their reactions are making me second guess myself and wondering if I'm the asshole.

Grief like that can literally alter brain chemistry and change a person.   \n\n\nOf course there's private matters but does the BiL know that side of the story for why he's in therapy? Not that he's warranted to know that information, but I am curious as to if his tune would change with that knowledge or not.  \n\n\nSome dudes make it a competition of \"I've endured so much grief and I'm the stronger person because of it because I didn't rely on others\".  \n\n\nAlso, in case it wasn't obvious, the BiL probably needs his own therapy for whatever he's got going on.

You now know your wife is a weak mother and weak woman who won\u2019t go to war for her own son. \n\nI don\u2019t do what typically happens on Reddit and jump to divorce over every little thing. But dude. I\u2019d seriously be considering wife\u2019s position in my life.", "NTA. I don\u2019t need to read the whole post to know this. Your son is suffering and you stood u for him end of story", "NTA \n\nYour wife sure is though", "NTA when you see him again tell him to stop being so emotional.", "Nta, but your wife and her comments were not only cruel but also dangerous, especially in front of your son.  It can undue all therapy and set him back.  His well-being is much more important than her brothers ego.  Honestly, this would be a deal-breaker for me. \n\nDepression is not something you take lightly, especially in males who often have difficulty because of stupid manliness nonsense.  I lost my brother to mental illness.  I would keep him away from people and places that are not supportive.", "NTA-Your wife just showed you who she was.", "NTA You did what you should have done in the situation....protect your son. Your wife didn't protect her son and reinforced her brother's behavior. Obviously, this was how they were raised, but your wife needs to work through these views and put her child first. I hope she will", "NTA, kudos to you for not only seeking therapy for your son,  but for standing up for him!! Good parent!!!", "NTA but your wife should be supporting your child. Children are not open for attack, particularly from family, where they should feel safe. Keep standing up for your kid, and keep the relatives away. Your insecure BIL should not be allowed contact.", "NTA. I wonder why wife was more upset for  her brother than her own son? Does she secretly agree with her brother, that the grieving process is taking too long for her liking? Does she really believe in therapy? Why the fragile ego of her brother is more important that her son\u2019s mental well being?Please sit down with wife and have a meaningful discussion. Don\u2019t allow BIL back into the house unless he apologises, specifically tell your son if his mom and uncle confront him while you\u2019re not around to tell you immediately ( and say that in front of your wife).", "Thank you for putting your son in therapy to process this loss. I lost my bestfriend when I was 17. I still have a lot of unprocessed emotions from not having grieved properly over it. Losing your bestfriend sucks and I am glad your son is getting therapy to deal with this loss.", "If your BIL were my BIL,  he'd owe me a thank you for allowing him to walk away without two broken knees and your wife is very, very, very wrong.", "NTA. Good on you for defending your son. I\u2019m sorry your wife and BIL are so toxic. I hope you don\u2019t have to spend too much time with either of them.", "NTA this is a hill I would die on for sure - you\u2019ve just shown you\u2019re willing to stand up for your son in front of him - at any cost! Well done \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", ">LOL, NTA, we call out toxicity wherever we see it\n\nHonestly, if I were in OP's position I probably would have displayed a bit of toxic masculinity myself and gotten physical, because shit like what the BIL said isn't kosher.\n\nAs for the wife, she ignored the fact that BIL directly disrespected her son by calling him a girl and by extension calling girls weak. Defending their son is not disrespecting the BIL. The wife needs to get her head on straight or she's going to lose the respect of her son.\n\nOP is NTA, but the wife and BIL sure are.", "Yep ! Took the words right out of my mouth", "It's a good way to make a point with men like th BIL. It's something they understand", "Toxic femininity needs to go too.", "I wonder if the wife secretly agrees with BIL", "But anger is okay. /s So harmful to men.", "If you really didn't read, then you missed the twist where the wife is as big/bigger of an ass than the BIL", "Handled it better? Brother is lucky hands weren't thrown. Talking shit about someone's kid to their face? Naw that is the literal definition of fighting words", "This comment would be counted as a \"no assholes here\" just so you know", "I disagree about the wife. She claimed OP \"disrespected\" her brother and is now ignoring OP. I'd say the two AHs here are the BIL and the wife.", "Two amazing parents? His wife sounds like she is on her brothers side. I wouldn\u2019t call that amazing.", "So you would respond to toxic masculinity with more of the same? Why not use your words?", "I would think so. They come from the same family and it\u2019s very possible that she shares his views. If a relative of mine did that to my kid, that person would be cut from my life, not be defending him.", "People usually aren't obligated to take the high road, but someone like OP (who is wise enough to raise their child without unhealthy gender roles and get them therapy to process loss) will surely understand that throwing hands would not be the best example to set for his son in this situation.", "You are right. I skimmed too fast.\n\nWon't edit because my mistake and would make your post look stupid if I did.", "As I read the post, wife was part of the decision to get son into therapy. It was husband's reaction that put her off.   \n\n\nI might get bent if someone came for one of my siblings. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f   \n\n\nI don't feel her reaction in the moment negates her initial choice to work with her husband for their son's benefit and I don't feel that initial motivation loses out over BIL being TA. \ud83e\udd14", "\ud83d\ude01"]}
