It was very hard for him and while I've always been there to help him, my wife and I felt that having a therapist would be best. He seems to be making a lot of progress, so I know it's working.\n\nUnfortunately, my bil is a men shouldn't express emotions kind of guy. I've always thought that was bs, so I made sure my wife and I were on the same page about not letting that happen.\n\nLast night there was a family gathering. My son had just had his therapy session, so we picked him up and drove there. While we there, my son was telling me about something they talked about, and my bil must have overheard, because he started on a tangent about boys not needing therapy and calling him a girl. I probably wouldn't have reacted as much if my son hadn't been there, by my son was visibly hurt by what he was saying.\n\nI was pissed at him and told him to F off and that right now my son is more of a man than he is. I would have liked to say more, but I didn't want to upset my son further. I admit that I might have gone a little too far, but I was defending my son. But I don't think someone who shames someone else for being healthy while also being sexist is being a \"man\".\n\nMy bil just glared at me and stormed out of the house. My wife told me that we were leaving so I got my son and we left. My son didn't say much the rest of night, but my wife sure did. She was mad at me for doing that, and saying I disrespected her brother. I tried to explain I was just defending my son from him, but she wouldn't take it and is ignoring me.\n\nI'm still mad over this. My son was shamed for expressing his emotions and then everyone gets mad at me for defending him. But all of their reactions are making me second guess myself and wondering if I'm the asshole.

Grief like that can literally alter brain chemistry and change a person.   \n\n\nOf course there's private matters but does the BiL know that side of the story for why he's in therapy? Not that he's warranted to know that information, but I am curious as to if his tune would change with that knowledge or not.  \n\n\nSome dudes make it a competition of \"I've endured so much grief and I'm the stronger person because of it because I didn't rely on others\".  \n\n\nAlso, in case it wasn't obvious, the BiL probably needs his own therapy for whatever he's got going on.

Or maybe it \"only\" resulted in verbal abuse -- which is still damaging, even if it isn't being physically hit.\n\nI'm really not saying any of this to \\*excuse\\* the wife.

And it may be something that she learned, growing up, that she \"can't\" fight; especially if her mother never pushed back against it.\n\nOP will obviously have a better idea of whether this is a possibility, since he knows her entire family.\n\nNo matter what, OP needs to sit down with her and dig into these reactions of hers.

Your BIL is horrible, and deserves to be yelled at.  It's clear that people don't usually take him to task for what he says -- and that's part of the problem.\n\nBut you've got a bigger problem with your wife.\n\nYou said that you and she were \"on the same page\" with regard to getting therapy for your kid... but, then she turns around, and allows her brother to mock him and verbally abuse him for being in therapy?  How does that work?\n\nFurthermore -- please don't underestimate the psychological damage it's now doing to your kid, that his mother is angry at his father for \\*sticking up for him\\*.\n\nLike, from your wife's point of view, she may just be angry at you for cursing at her brother, and for \"causing a scene\" in public. (It's extremely common for people to respond more strongly to what they perceive to be \"rocking the boat\", than to the original insult in the first place.)\n\nBut she needs to understand that from her child's point of view, she's angry at you for coming to his defense.\n\nAnd, it would be a really good idea to talk out the issue that you came to his defense... and she did not. So, what did she think about what her brother said to the kid?  Why did she think it was okay to just ignore that, rather than tell her brother it was wrong?\n\nThere's a lot of stuff going on here, and your wife is not in the right for ANY of it.\n\nIn several ways, she's making things worse for your kid, and undoing the good of him going to therapy.\n\n(Sorry, editing to add a thought I forgot to include: your wife says she's mad at you for \"disrespecting\" her brother.  What you need to ask her is why he is owed respect, when he disrespected your child, and by extension, both you and her?  Respect isn't owed to someone who refuses to give it in return.  Not only was he directly attacking your son, his attitude towards your son being in therapy undoubtedly reflects on what you and your wife are \"permitting\", or encouraging your son to do.  So why IS he owed any respect, again?  No, really.  Have her explain it.  And then have her explain why he is owed respect, but your son isn't, and you aren't.)\n\n(And listen, I didn't even get INTO how obviously fucked up it is that your BIL feels that calling someone a girl is an insult.  That is sadly very common, but it's not something you, or she, should tolerate.  No woman who has any self-respect should tolerate that.  She should have told her brother immediately that it was fucked up of him, and to keep his fucked-up views about gender to himself.)", "If BIL is so afraid of his emotions maybe you should suggest he needs therapy.

I also think therapist are overrated as fuck", "That could be part of the problem, and it's important for OP to figure that out.  \n\nBut, I do think it's equally possible that she doesn't agree with her brother, but that her family was structured in a way in which the older men are allowed to be assholes to everyone, but anyone (especially a woman, or a younger person/child) talking back or standing up for themselves is being \"disrespectful\".  And her reaction here is about the idea that her brother \"can't\" have been disrespecting her child, because that's \"just the way things are\".\n\nSometimes, people need a really severe wake-up call to realize that this is not the only way for family dynamics to operate.\n\nThere's a great quote, which I think originated with a Tumblr user (although they might have gotten it from somewhere else), that goes something like: for some people, when they ask for respect, it means asking to be treated like a human being. And for some people, then they ask for respect, it means being deferred to as an authority figure.  For those people, when they say \"if you don't respect me, I won't respect you\", what they mean is, \"if you don't defer to me as an authority figure, I will not treat you like a human being\".\n\nThat quote originally came up in the context of more institutional authority, like the police, or other people in positions of power.  But it can equally apply to the way some families operate, where the male head of the family has this attitude.", "That\u2019s what her poor son thinks.", "The people who say men shouldn\u2019t have feelings usually mean that men shouldn\u2019t have feelings *other* than anger.", "I lost a friend at 15 and so wish I had therapy. Thank goodness for this dad.", "My stepmom likes me more than my bio mom xD but I get where u come from", "Still more of a man the the bil", "Sure, list them then.", "\"Reading is for pussies, wtf???\" - that whole family", "He didn't do anything \"wrong\". I think of his response as existing on a spectrum of \"right\" responses. A \"better\" first response is _possible_. These family situations are often more nuanced than simply telling someone to F off and being done with it. There may be strained relationships and effects that could be experienced by the rest of his family apart from him and his son, which is why some would want to navigate it a bit more carefully.", "Please refer to my earlier comment.", "I'm guessing her and her sibling are far more alike than OP has ever noticed.
