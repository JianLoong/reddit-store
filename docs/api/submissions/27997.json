Aaron's son, Sam (17m)  is apart of my friend group but I wouldn't say we are close. \nMum and Aaron broke up after mum found lady's underwear in Aaron's house that wasn't her's. They had a row about it, mum accused Aaron of cheating on her and Aaron naturally denied it. I know my mum has been hurt in the past. My bio dad wasn't a nice man and hurt her. Aaron was the first person she's dated since my step dad passed away 3 years ago. Mum thought he was lying to her and ended the relationship then and there leaving them both very hurt. I saw Aaron around after they split and he looked every hurt. He still comes around almost every day as they have a baby together (4 months F) and he has this like hurt look when he sees mum. They don't talk when he is over unless it's about the baby. I've heard mum cry about it at night. I know she is really hurt. I see the same hurt look on her. It's only been about 4 weeks since the breakup. \n\nI found out at school that Sam is responsible for the breakup. Another friend (Vinny) in the group heard him laughing about the breakup and telling them how he was glad that mum and Aaron are no longer together. He had told Vinny that he had planted the underwear in Aaron's room for mum to find. Apparently he had gotten them from his girlfriend. I confronted Sam about this and he admitted that he had planted the underwear. Sam didn't like that Aaron was in a relationship as it meant Aaron wasn't willing to give Sam everything he wanted right when he wanted it. Especially after the baby was born, Aaron dropping plans to go to a concert last minute because my mum was in labour didn't help. The fact Aaron was seeing my mum made it worse, as he hates my mum. My mum works as a solicitor and he blames her for his mum being in prison. My mum had nothing to do with that trial, she works in family law, not criminal law. Sam had tried getting Aaron to break up with mum by telling him lies however Aaron saw through the lies. When mum was pregnant, Sam became really angry and desperate to get them to split. He's never seen the baby, doesnt even acknowledge that she exists. It was his girlfriend who suggested hiding underwear as she knew about what a rat bag by bio dad was as I had told her. I had thought she was a friend. \n\nI don't know what to do. I know I need to tell my mum the truth but I'm not sure how to, or if she'll believe me. I don't have any proof.
