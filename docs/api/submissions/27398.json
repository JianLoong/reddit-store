This is because my family enjoys these foods, I like to cook these foods, and my mom cooked a bunch of these foods growing up since she\u2019s half Japanese.\n\nOften times I\u2019ll either give my daughter some leftovers from last nights dinner, plus a fruit/veggie and a snack, or I\u2019ll make her a quick little bento box or some other thing really quick.\n\nSo, after school one day, my daughter wanted to play on the playground for a bit before we went home. I said she could play for a few minutes, and she ran off to play. I was waiting next to this other parent, who we\u2019ll call Debra. While I was waiting, Debra came up to me.\n\nDebra: Are you Lily\u2019s mother?\n\nMe: Oh, yeah, I am, why?\n\nDebra: Well, your daughter\u2019s lunches have been bothering my son, and I would like to ask you to pack something else.\n\nMe: What? How are they bothering him?\n\nShe then proceeded to start talking about how her son was complaining about my daughters lunches smelling terrible, and that he thought it was disgusting. She also said her son didn\u2019t eat most of his lunch because he was so grossed out.\n\nMe: Okay\u2026I understand your son doesn\u2019t like the smell, but can\u2019t he just sit somewhere else?\n\nDebra: Are you kidding me? My son shouldn\u2019t have to put up with whatever crap you make your daughter bring to this school. It\u2019s disgusting!\n\nAnd she started making more vaguely racist complaints, but I was fed up at this point.\n\nMe: Listen, I understand your son might not like my daughters food, but he can very easily just not sit next to her. I\u2019m not changing what\u2019s in my daughters lunches because you and your kid don\u2019t want to exist near Asian food. Fuck off.\n\nShe angrily stomped off with her kid then, and my daughter finished playing soon after, so we went home.\n\nI talked to my husband about it, and he said that maybe I shouldn\u2019t have told her to fuck off, to avoid her bothering us in the future.

They also don't have the widest or most refined palates, subsisting mostly on basic sandwiches, chicken fingers, pizza, pasta, burgers and hot dogs.
