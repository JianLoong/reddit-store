This is because my family enjoys these foods, I like to cook these foods, and my mom cooked a bunch of these foods growing up since she\u2019s half Japanese.\n\nOften times I\u2019ll either give my daughter some leftovers from last nights dinner, plus a fruit/veggie and a snack, or I\u2019ll make her a quick little bento box or some other thing really quick.\n\nSo, after school one day, my daughter wanted to play on the playground for a bit before we went home. I said she could play for a few minutes, and she ran off to play. I was waiting next to this other parent, who we\u2019ll call Debra. While I was waiting, Debra came up to me.\n\nDebra: Are you Lily\u2019s mother?\n\nMe: Oh, yeah, I am, why?\n\nDebra: Well, your daughter\u2019s lunches have been bothering my son, and I would like to ask you to pack something else.\n\nMe: What? How are they bothering him?\n\nShe then proceeded to start talking about how her son was complaining about my daughters lunches smelling terrible, and that he thought it was disgusting. She also said her son didn\u2019t eat most of his lunch because he was so grossed out.\n\nMe: Okay\u2026I understand your son doesn\u2019t like the smell, but can\u2019t he just sit somewhere else?\n\nDebra: Are you kidding me? My son shouldn\u2019t have to put up with whatever crap you make your daughter bring to this school. It\u2019s disgusting!\n\nAnd she started making more vaguely racist complaints, but I was fed up at this point.\n\nMe: Listen, I understand your son might not like my daughters food, but he can very easily just not sit next to her. I\u2019m not changing what\u2019s in my daughters lunches because you and your kid don\u2019t want to exist near Asian food. Fuck off.\n\nShe angrily stomped off with her kid then, and my daughter finished playing soon after, so we went home.\n\nI talked to my husband about it, and he said that maybe I shouldn\u2019t have told her to fuck off, to avoid her bothering us in the future.

They also don't have the widest or most refined palates, subsisting mostly on basic sandwiches, chicken fingers, pizza, pasta, burgers and hot dogs. The boy was able to perceive that the smell was off-putting to him but might not be able to understand that the food is part of his classmate's culture so saying it's gross has deeper negative connotations.

Fuck off until you come up to a gate with a sign saying \u201cYou Can\u2019t Fuck Off Past Here\u201d. Climb over the gate, dream the impossible dream, and keep fucking off forever", "You should! Neither of these things should be avoided just because of racism.", "What about when the crazy one has the fastest legs?", "Just get there first.  There's no reason in public schools anymore.", "I agree with you but also want to point out that there is a chance that the racist mom complained to the teacher first and the teacher wasn\u2019t having it.", "My suspicion says fish sauce in some form, though I'm more familiar with that from viet/thai. I'm not sure how predominant it us in Japanese cuisine. \n\nObviously most foods I'd use fish sauce is are not generally served cold, but the OP said she's sending dinner leftovers.\n\nI know I often don't reheat leftovers.... particularly at work if it contains any form of seafood.", ">The rogue durian, according to library staff, was left near an air vent on the library\u2019s second level and eventually removed in a sealed bag.\n\nSomeone pulled that shit as a prank? Wtf it's not like they're eating it or anything some mfer just left it to spread", "I'd say more a mix of old sweaty boot, cabbage and the taste of tinfoil converted into smell.", "I worked in an office where I was in a secure room at the literal other end of the building from the kitchen and could still acutely tell when someone was microwaving fish. If my team were complaining about it, I can only imagine what the people next to the kitchen were thinking.", "I\u2019d put my on a savory sandwich but not a sweet one", "There's a reason we have a bunch of cooler blocks in our freezer and lunch containers for all our family members are insulated. To be able to keep everyone's school /work food sufficiently cool to not be a health hazard.  \n  \nSome may suggest the refrigerator for those who work, but I've been sufficiently burnt by that enough to have a desire to avoid it if possible.", "I love Japanese food. It\u2019s mostly soy sauce based. I can\u2019t think of any use of fish sauce. Teriyaki is the most pungent thing I can think of and even that is just a sweet soy sauce based sauce. Sometimes ramen bowls have a few different things but nothing I can think of that\u2019s particularly smelly.", "lol fair enough, it\u2019s hard to pin down a cohesive cultural cuisine for the US since they kind of murdered most of the Indigenous population and now it\u2019s a country of immigrants\u2026 you\u2019d still be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn\u2019t like *any* of the dishes invented in the US though, even if they\u2019re not into fast food. \n\ncajun cuisine, soul food, Tex Mex/big ass burritos, crab cakes & clam chowder, cheesecake, apple pie, banana splits\u2026 lots of deliciousness in that messy country. \ud83d\ude0b", "Strangely enough I would say it's fairly equivalent.", "Ah, good point, I didn't consider that, definitely an odd food smell.", "That slaps tbh\n\n(Pretty sure it\u2019s a uke, banjos are bigger)", "\"I checked in with The Internet, and it says fuck off times a hundred thousand.\"", "Yeah, I'd be more curious about some of the japanese curries where there has been a fairly direct input from south Asia.... but again just speculating. \n\nAlso, since I've read further.... apparently OP has stated that we are basically talking about dishes like chicken teriyaki.... which makes it really hard to understand what the complaint was about. \n\nEven \"white bread\" america should be pretty comfortable with teriyaki.", "The FDA (as the other person said) does consider it to be a tree nut! That doesn't mean it is a nut, however, just like how peanuts and cashews aren't true nuts.", "We teach that there are grown up words and cruel words. Grown up words are like shit, words that can be useful or hurtful depending on how you use them, and we don't get to use them until we understand how and why they can be hurtful. Cruel words are ones like racial slurs that have a long history of pain and we don't ever use those no matter what. Most words themselves aren't bad necessarily, it's our intent that matters most. I can call you a soda pop of a human being and while the words themselves aren't mean my intent to hurt you with them makes the words I use a problem. \n\nSwear words are absolutely arbitrary and I will die on that hill.", "Seriously! My kids learned not to \"yuck\" someone else's \"yum\" in preschool.", "I'm not. Frigging helicopter parenting at its best. For the record, most schools have policies about confonting other parents about issues between the children. The first stop should have been the clasroom teacher, who might have moved the son and then none of this would have happened, (or not because the parent is a racist), and then the principal if she wanted to get all 'in someone's face' about it.\n\nI agree with the poster above who said to email the principal yourself.  Focus on the main issue of her telling you what to feed your child, not the well earned 'fuck off' but I would mention it anyway because she will for sure tell them anyway if they call her about it.", "But how is she going to teach her kid manners when she obviously hasn't got any herself?", "One of the most passive-aggressive, condescending people I know gets weirdly puritanical over swear words. This woman loves to talk about how she was in the Army.", "An ocean in Arizona for you?? What does that mean, it sounds hilarious hahah", "Then do both! :D Email the situation and request a one on one!", "I was only clarifying because you said \"especially since those with tree nut allergies like almonds, cashews, and walnuts *are* also allergic to coconut\" ... your 'walnuts are' should be 'walnuts may also be'.  It's just how you phrased that part.  I'm sure you know but was saying for others that might misinterpret..", "My wife and I taught my daughter just that lesson, and it worked well. She was on the bus w some kid who was being mean and she told them to \u201cfuck off.\u201d Shut them down in a hurry and kept them shut down. Later she asked if we were mad that she\u2019d said that, and we told her we were very proud of her for using the right word in the right situation.", "Love this take.", "Exactly!", "Lol the Army drops some creative ones but they definitely employ fuck in all word tenses.", "Usually means the person is extremely gullible. The fact that they think high schoolers don\u2019t have a colorful language when not around adults or authority figures is laughable and obviously they would believe something equally outlandish like an ocean in Arizona", "Only if he is microwaving Surstr\u00f6mming", "Email and request an in person meeting.", "And record the conversations for backup CYA", "Rob's go to sandwich is peanut butter, bologna, and mayonnaise on the same sandwich.", "This is the way ;-)", "I\u2019d bring a salad and we could share."]}
