If your girlfriend can\u2019t learn to ride it\u2019s a danger to you both, giving a friend a ride on your one mode of conveyance isn\u2019t sexual and it\u2019s weird as hell that people are trying to make it seem that way.", "nop\nsome people are completely allergic to the mere suggestion that they could do something differently.", "That's a murder attempt", "One of my exes did the same thing to me when I was driving a rental car and I had a car full of my friends and we quite literally kicked him out and left him on the highway. One place you don\u2019t fuck around is on the road.", "Give her the option of straitjacket, back seat, or trunk.", "Pillion is a perfectly cromulent English word.", "Its simple instructions follow my back with your chest hold on around my waist and dont step off a foot peg until i ask you too. If you need to talk tap my helmet ill pull over.", "And is OP just saying \u201clean into the turn\u201d or is he actually telling her what that means?  I had someone say this to me many times and act like I should know which way that meant I should lean. When I would ask for clarification they would act annoyed and literally just repeat that I should \u201clean in.\u201d \n\n\u201cInto\u201d the turn could mean both ways. Like we \u201clean into something\u201d meaning to go along with something. Or we \u201clean into something\u201d meaning leaning toward the center. But it isn\u2019t clear if you\u2019re not used to riding. It was extra confusing because I assumed that you would lean on a motorcycle the way that you lean when riding a bicycle and that felt obvious to me, but the person was so over-the-top insistent before we left that I had to \u201clean in\u201d that I was completely confused.", "How are the comms while riding? I stopped riding a while back and never had them. Usually I just gestured. Which I'm positive wasn't safe. This is also when i thought I was an unkillable youth who could wear a helmet and a tank top and gym shorts with my gym back on one side. \n\n\nHow aren't I dead from pure stupidity?", "Your insecurity doesn't make someone else an asshole.", "The you would need to get over yourself as, in this scenario, you are a danger to the boyfriend and everyone else on the road", "Yes why wouldnt I be", "Christ insecurity is unattractive", "Dare I suggest that these people won't make good partners?  The problem isn't trying to teach them something, the problem is having a relationship with them.", "Murder attempt implies malice behind it, as opposed to stupidity.  Considering they were both in the car, and the driver is much more protected, I'd chalk this up to stupidity. They probably thought the car would just simply stop, especially if they didn't have a license.", "True...Lest it rise up to meet you one day.", "OP, the person you\u2019re responding to just told you that she had trouble feeling when her husband was leaning, even when she was holding on to him. \n\nShe also told you that her husband listened to her when she said she couldn\u2019t tell and, instead of minimizing it and writing her off forever, they were able to work together to solve the problem and it sounds like they now have a nice time riding together. \n\nIt might be worth thinking about how this could be applicable to your situation.", "Leaning can definitely be confusing when you don\u2019t know how to ride! A lot of motorcyclists don\u2019t realize that they do this naturally and it has to be explained. I had to have my husband explain to me a couple times leaning into a turn versus counter-leaning. Once I learned the difference it helped him out a lot.", "We use cardos which is helpful! We have ours connected to each other so they auto connect. You can also listen to music if you wanted to while also being in a call, it\u2019ll pause the music when it detects a voice. I normally don\u2019t listen to music while I ride. Gestures only helped so much between us. It was hard for my husband to communicate certain things with me while backpacking. Comms made it significantly better for him to communicate with me what he wanted me to do. He couldn\u2019t really tell me if he was leaning or counter-leaning without them.", "Honestly sounds like you\u2019re secure and she\u2019s not and that\u2019s the actual problem.", "This answer made me laugh because the other guy clearly is insecure and thought you wouldn\u2019t be lmao", "Eh, you're just looking at one aspect of their personality. They can have plenty of other redeeming features."]}
