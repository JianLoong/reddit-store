Without more info on why your mother acts this way, it's impossible to determine if there is an asshole in your situation. You're totally justified in not wanting negative energy in your home, but your mother's shutdowns may be a psychological coping method when she's emotionally overwhelmed. You are assuming malice where there may just be a maladaptive coping strategy for emotionally fraught situations. \n \n\nWhen I'm under a lot of stress, I just flat-out can't deal with people and their emotional needs. I do not have the same mental guidelines or behavioral patterns that my family does, and when they speak to me it's like they're speaking a foreign language they expect me to be fully fluent in. We're talking to each other, but I can tell we're not COMMUNICATING. It's terrifying and frustrating and exhausting. So I will lock myself away or refuse to speak more than absolutely necessary, bc if I relax my hold on my emotional state I'll have a meltdown and make everything worse. \n\n\nI am not saying your mother may be autistic. I am saying she may not have the same ability to regulate her emotions as you do, and outright rejecting her for it is likely not going to be helpful. \n\n\nCommunicate directly to her that her behavior stresses you out and hurts your feelings, and that if she isn't in the right state of mind for a family dinner you would prefer to put it off until she is feeling better.

She'd let no one else in the house to look after her either. She'd snap out of it and once she was out of it, it would be as if nothing had happened. She never seemed embarrassed or anything. It still boggles my mind as my dad is the kindest man and no one else in the family was like this. We tried to talk her into therapy and she refused to go.

She can't be invited if she won't talk to you....", "NTA whatsoever and honestly, I'm happy for you that you were able to set this boundary. My mom is similar; not the silent treatment like yours but she refuses to communicate when she's upset. She slams doors, locks herself in her room and blasts music and if not that (even when I was a kid and my dad worked nights and was not home) she'd make comments about how no one cared about her, appreciated her, and she'd be better off dead and just drive away. And dating myself a bit here but cell phones were not a thing during that time so she'd leave me, my twin sister and our baby brother home alone in the house never knowing if she was actually going to come back. In hindsight as an adult now I realize how truly traumatic and how lasting those episodes were. Anyways,\n\nYour mom's Moods are not normal and not healthy. As you said, they affect everyone around her and make everyone either walk on tenterhooks or miserable and that's not okay. It's okay to be upset, even if it's over something small, but her way of handling it is not. And the problem is she's never had consequences for acting like this. She's never missed out on anything and she doesn't care about what her response has done to hurt others. So draw the line. Will it hurt if she comes out of her Mood after the fact and she realizes what she missed out on? Will she scream and yell and maybe even shut down again? Possibly, highly likely. But she needs to see firsthand that actions have consequences and what she's doing is emotional abuse. \n\nI tried talking to my mom a couple years ago (also a young adult now in mid-30s) about this when she went into one of her Moods and I was snapped at and sarcastically called \"Therapist\" and admittedly I haven't tried again. But I've also grown more distant with her and she's lost friendships and those closer relationships because I'm not willing to put myself through that kind of abuse because she has less communication skills than a toddler. I hope this may be the wake up call your mom needs to find some healthier coping methods.
