Without more info on why your mother acts this way, it's impossible to determine if there is an asshole in your situation. You're totally justified in not wanting negative energy in your home, but your mother's shutdowns may be a psychological coping method when she's emotionally overwhelmed. You are assuming malice where there may just be a maladaptive coping strategy for emotionally fraught situations. \n \n\nWhen I'm under a lot of stress, I just flat-out can't deal with people and their emotional needs. I do not have the same mental guidelines or behavioral patterns that my family does, and when they speak to me it's like they're speaking a foreign language they expect me to be fully fluent in. We're talking to each other, but I can tell we're not COMMUNICATING. It's terrifying and frustrating and exhausting. So I will lock myself away or refuse to speak more than absolutely necessary, bc if I relax my hold on my emotional state I'll have a meltdown and make everything worse. \n\n\nI am not saying your mother may be autistic. I am saying she may not have the same ability to regulate her emotions as you do, and outright rejecting her for it is likely not going to be helpful. \n\n\nCommunicate directly to her that her behavior stresses you out and hurts your feelings, and that if she isn't in the right state of mind for a family dinner you would prefer to put it off until she is feeling better.

She'd let no one else in the house to look after her either. She'd snap out of it and once she was out of it, it would be as if nothing had happened. She never seemed embarrassed or anything.

My mom is similar; not the silent treatment like yours but she refuses to communicate when she's upset. She slams doors, locks herself in her room and blasts music and if not that (even when I was a kid and my dad worked nights and was not home) she'd make comments about how no one cared about her, appreciated her, and she'd be better off dead and just drive away. And dating myself a bit here but cell phones were not a thing during that time so she'd leave me, my twin sister and our baby brother home alone in the house never knowing if she was actually going to come back. In hindsight as an adult now I realize how truly traumatic and how lasting those episodes were. Anyways,\n\nYour mom's Moods are not normal and not healthy. As you said, they affect everyone around her and make everyone either walk on tenterhooks or miserable and that's not okay. It's okay to be upset, even if it's over something small, but her way of handling it is not. And the problem is she's never had consequences for acting like this. She's never missed out on anything and she doesn't care about what her response has done to hurt others. So draw the line. Will it hurt if she comes out of her Mood after the fact and she realizes what she missed out on? Will she scream and yell and maybe even shut down again? Possibly, highly likely. But she needs to see firsthand that actions have consequences and what she's doing is emotional abuse. \n\nI tried talking to my mom a couple years ago (also a young adult now in mid-30s) about this when she went into one of her Moods and I was snapped at and sarcastically called \"Therapist\" and admittedly I haven't tried again. But I've also grown more distant with her and she's lost friendships and those closer relationships because I'm not willing to put myself through that kind of abuse because she has less communication skills than a toddler. I hope this may be the wake up call your mom needs to find some healthier coping methods.

Reminds me of when my kid was a toddler and she would throw a tantrum and I would just step over her body and keep going.  You put together the Thanksgiving dinner YOU want to have and if she has a silent tantrum, just pass the potatoes like she's not getting under your skin. Two things may happen: 1) she will get over it and realize you're not falling for her act or 2) she will get pissed cos she's not getting her way and start really acting ridiculous and then it will be amusing to everyone.", "Is it depression?", "Let her know she is entitled to her moods but they are not to be born at your home.

I agree with you and have issues with my own mom. If she can't act like an adult then she's not invited.", "Giving someone the \u201csilent treatment\u201d is a form of abuse and manipulation.  Ignore it.  Sounds like your family is used to trying to get her to communicate and give her attention.  It\u2019s giving her a positive reinforcement for inappropriate behavior. Just like we should ignore toddler tantrums.", "INFO I'm not so quick to NTA this... Is she doing it to manipulate you as a few people have mentioned OR has something triggered her and she's gone into a freeze response? My most common stress response is to freeze which looks like me laying on the couch watching tv for hours, moving very little, still sometimes attending events but I'm very passive and \"not there\" emotionally. I'm not doing it intentionally and it can be really difficult to recognise I'm in it and to break it.  \n\n\nHowever even saying this if her behaviour is impacting you negatively then you're perfectly justified to not want to be around it.

It sounds like she could benefit from some professional help to figure out why she has those moments.  It might make her feel worse to know she\u2019s not invited- I don\u2019t know that she is just narcissistic or has some deeper mental health concern.  Whether or not she feels worse, you still need to take care of yourself and if you need to I invite her, that\u2019s on her.", "r/raisedbynarcissists  might help in other ways. \"No tantrum-y children at Thanksgiving\" will help your mood.", "Yes, you are being unfeeling.\n\nSometimes your mother gets sad and has difficulty coping with being alive. She then isolates herself until she is able to interact with other people positively again.\nI understand how this pattern must have been really difficult and confusing to witness as a child, but now that you are an adult: try having some compassion. Be grateful that you've won the genetic lottery as you clearly don't identity with her suffering.\n\nUn-inviting her from Thanksgiving is like kicking someone who is already lying flat on the ground.\n\nEven if she \"gets out of her mood in time\", she will 100 % not feel welcome and most likely, she never will again.\n\nIs this your intention, OP?

I have no idea what it is for your mother, but for me it was a trauma response of living with two narcissists. Even then, it is on me to learn to vocalize, just like it is with your mother.

She also has a temper and stuff but basically for a lot of reasons, I couldn't wait to move out. I'd say limtijg my time around her helped greatly, but the best thing for me was to not let her into my home when she was behaving like this. My home is my sanctuary and I won't let her toxicity ruin it. I hate visiting my parents because the house reminds me of how I use to feel when I lived there. I hated going home because she was often in a pissy mood and there was never any getting through to her.
