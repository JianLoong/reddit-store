Damn, you're ruthless. This is cruel. There is no lesson to be learned here - this will only teach her to resent you. She's never going to forget this. Good luck with your relationship with her in the future.", "YTA. You and her dad need to get on the same page before making these decisions - you told her she had to ask her dad for Oliver's ipad money as her Christmas gift and are surprised he didn't acquiesce to your demands? And then you're surprised that while *you* tried to unilaterally decide what he's going to get her for Christmas, that instead he used his money to buy his daughter an ipad, which she wanted?\n\nIt's fine that actions have consequences and that she has to do something to \"make up\" the money for the ipad. Being generally grounded and doing some household chores should be sufficient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you're on Oliver's side here, which it sounds like you are, and there's a possibility Nova broke his ipad out of jealousy, why do you think forcing her to spend the holiday alone is going to change her behavior? You need to address that jealousy issue.", "YTA. This is bad parenting and some wild illogical actions from you. First of all, why do you just take your stepson's word for this being intentional? It could've been an accident for all we know, since you don't give any other reason other than your stepson thinking she did it on purpose.\n\nSecond of all, you have zero right to expect Nova's father to contribute half the money for Oliver's iPad. I was scratching my head at that one. Demanding Nova to ask her father for half the money was absolutely ridiculous. If you want her to cover half the cost, then tell her she needs to get a job, or do chores to earn the money or something.\n\nYou cannot control what Nova's father gets her for Christmas nor how his money is spent. Get that through because it's really wild that you think you have a say over that.\n\nAnd grounding her for Christmas is just cruel. You could've established she has to share her new iPad with Oliver while she's at your house, until she can help buy him a new one. Or that she cannot use it while at yours, if anything. Making her spend the holiday in her room is Dursley-esque crap.\n\n(Edit: I don't know why I had originally typed E S H but I had meant YTA).", "INFO: why is Oliver the only one that had an iPad?", "YTA\n\nI think you have good intentions, but I think your punishment was too harsh to begin with. I also have so many questions. Do you know for sure it wasn't an accident? If you don't, how come you're taking your son's words over your daughter's? Why did he have an ipad and she didn't when they're only a year apart, or why wasn't it shared?\n\nI think a simple apology would've been enough, especially since it's a he said she said scenario from what I gathered. Not only that, you punished HER for HER FATHER not giving her the money to buy your son a new ipad. Christmas or not, I think that's a little cruel.", "Yta\n\nThere are a thousand other ways she can make her repay her damage... And you can keep her iPad from her at your home until she earns enough to replace his IPad.\n\nIt kind of sounds like you don't like your daughter very much. Why does your step son's word that it was jealousy mean more than your daughter's word of accident?\n\nHolidays are family time... By banning her from family celebrations you are tellingnyour daughter than she can not ever mess up or you're kicking her out of the family(time). Kids do dumb shit and things get broken. They are kids. Don't compound the issue by making her feel unloved or unable to make mistakes.\n\nEta: Not to mention... Why is her father paying half and your daughter paying half... Why aren't you all going 3rds in it? Or your ex paying 1/4th, you 1/4th, and your child half? You are just as much as her parent. Why is it your exhusbands responsibility to pay for the iPad that was your step son's and was broken in your home? Why doesn't your gifts to her go to replace the iPad instead of her father's? \n\n(I actually just figured out the lady part. Mom must have told daughter she wasn't getting any gifts from mom And step father, and any gifts she gets goes towards the replacement iPad, which is extra effed up.) \n\nWhere do you shop for audacity? That's a lot of ovarian fortitude to try to dictate how your ex is the only grown up required to. contribute financially to replace something he had nothing to do with for a child that isn't his. \n\nIt sounds like you allow a behavioral situation to happen in your home and then take no responsibility for it.\nAnd I still don't know how you know your stepson is not lying but your daughter is?\n\nYou're the super sized asshole.", "YTA. Christmas day and the whole gifting thing should be immune from punishment. Forcing daughter to beg dad for money for Christmas so she can turn around and give it to Oliver is wrong because it leaves her without gifts.

So she should be expected to help replace it. \n\nNot your EX. Your ex didn't take the iPad. And yes, having your ex give your daughter the money to pay for the iPad means he is paying for the iPad. \n\nInstead, you should have had her do extra chores to work it off. Or diminished her allowance or something. You gave her an adult punishment then penalized her because she couldn't pay the fee. Now you're mad that she's mad that you made her pay for something and then punished her when she couldn't pay it. \n\nWelcome to the American penal system. Where the low-earning get one speeding ticket, can't pay it, then get pulled up in court with more fines because they miss the deadline to pay it, then have a warrant out for their arrest, get put in jail, miss work, lose their job, and still can't pay the ticket. \n\nIt doesn't work for adults.

Find a way for her to earn the money, perhaps by doing chores, to buy a new iPad for Oliver.  It sounds like it was accidental.  You can't control her Dad or what he does for her for Christmas.  You can make the iPad stay at her dad's, but prepare to see less of her.  Don't ground her over Christmas. That's ridiculous.", "YTA: she gets grounded to her room while you enjoy Christmas with the rest of the family?", "Info: You didn't discuss the punishment with your  ex husband that you \\*included\\* him in?????", "YTA, nice creating a memory of you hating her during Christmas, you know she probably will never forget this and will always hold it against you.", "YTA. First, you can\u2019t control what her father gets her for Christmas so demanding he give her money to replace the iPad was never going to work. Second, if she did indeed break it on purpose, there are other ways to have her pay for a new one that have nothing to do with ruining her Christmas. \n\nWhich brings me to; she claims it was an accident but her step brother \u201cbelieves\u201d it was due to jealousy. So you don\u2019t really have proof it was intentional and have just decided the step brother was correct. Maybe he is, but did you sit down and talk with both of them to see if you could find out exactly how it happened? \n\nChristmas gifts should not be used as punishment. If you are hell bent she must pay for a new iPad, have her do chores around the home to \u201cearn\u201d the funds.", ">She claimed it was an accident but Oliver believes she did it out of jealousy\n\nWell, which was it? You are the parent... You don't get to just abdicate responsibility for figuring out if you are dealing with your daughter maliciously destroying her stepbrother's things (in which case, just requiring her to replace it monetarily is incredibly insufficient as a punishment *and* you probably need to get her/the whole family into counseling immediately) or whether you are dealing with a legitimate mistake (in which case, you should be talking to her about responsibility and helping her find a way to to earn the money herself, not gratuitously punishing her for being a teenager who doesn't have much money).\n\nBut regardless of which situation it is, YTA for using Christmas as a punishment *and* for attempting to make your ex contribute to an item that was broken when your daughter was *your* responsibility, not his.", "YTA Christmas is about spending time with family. Yes she deserves punishment but banning xmas isn't the way.  Ban her from.using electronics while at your house and make her leave her iPad at her dads.", "YTA YTA YTA\n\nunless you can prove without a doubt that Nova broke Oliver\u2019s iPad on purpose (which you obviously can\u2019t because you said he believes she did it out of jealousy, not that you know) why are you so set on believing him over her? \n\nTo tell her she has to ask her dad for the money to replace it is ridiculous.

She clearly doesn't understand why it's her responsibility to reimburse you for that. Forcing her to reimburse you for the iPad is not going to make her any more clear to her why should she, so she's not going to do it by herself next time. If jealousy was the problem, her dad already messed the lesson up by buying her one.\n\nTbh I don't know how would I deal with this situation. Try and talk to her open-mindedly and see how she feels. If she really believes it was an accident and isn't lying about that, perhaps she believes it's unfair to be so severely punished for something she didn't have any intention of doing? Maybe ask her how would she feel if you accidentally broke her new iPad that she is getting and would she want you to get her a new one if that happened. Would she think it was very different whether it was an accident or not, or would she just want you to fix the damage you caused regardless?\n\nIf it wasn't an accident and she knows it, that's a bit more difficult. I guess it depends on why she's jealous. It's a much deeper problem.\n\nBut either way, I don't think punishment is going to solve her wrong mindset here. If anything, it might make her even more jealous and resentful for you to spend Christmas with Oliver and without her. If she felt jealous in the first place because she feels neglected, you're going to severely exacerbate the issue.\n\nI agree that realistic consequences are appropriate, but I think forcing them by using your power over her isn't likely to be productive. You have to get her on board somehow.", "ESH.  Making Nova replace Oliver\u2019s iPad?  Fine.  Demanding her dad pay for half of it?  Not really sure why you\u2019re surprised the lesson she took from that is that she should just go to him to fix her problems.  Forcing her to stay in her room for Christmas?  Even Scrooge would call that cold.  \n\nTake several steps back and refocus this on the actual problem, which is replacing Oliver\u2019s iPad in the short term, and in the longer term fixing this hostility between the kids.  None of which is going to be helped by how this has shaken out so far.", "ESH\n\nObviously your daughter screwed up ... but the punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime. What exactly do you think her sitting in her room, without any gifts will accomplish? Certainly, won\u2019t fix Oliver\u2019s iPad problem. I think a better punishment may be that the iPad stays at Dad\u2019s house until Oliver gets his replaced. She can keep it, just not at your house.\n\nYour ex is an AH for allowing her to get away with this behavior. You both clearly have a problem communicating regarding parenting your daughter\n\neta \u2014 regardless of whether or not this was an accident... if you use someone else\u2019s stuff & it breaks... you replace it. Period. It is not appropriate nor kind to get yourself a new one & while the other person\u2019s item is still broken!", "YTA", "Almost ESH. To be fair, there is no easy way to deal with a situation such as this without needing to be a bit of an asshole. I think you had the right intentions for Oliver and I think it\u2019s great that you advocate for your stepson \u2014 but I think there were some things that could have been done differently. Either way, respect for aiming to be fair.\n\nHer father is definitely an asshole for not caring how Nova\u2019s actions effect other people \u2014 she did something pretty bad and the fact that he\u2019s rewarding her for that sucks, so I do feel you on that, OP. \n\nBut you are a slight AH for assuming her dad would cough up money for a situation he wasn\u2019t apart of \u2014 did you try talking to him about it prior to telling your daughter he\u2019d be putting $$$ towards getting Oliver his new iPad? In a way, you\u2019re punishing Nova because her dad is choosing to celebrate Christmas with her (albeit in a crappy way). \n\nHonestly, at 14 I had friends selling snacks, crocheted items, chocolate, even duck taped wallets \u2014 when there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way, and making her earn the money is going to be the best learning lesson. Cancelling Christmas for her might be too extreme, and I can see that backfiring because she\u2019d most likely be mad at you without learning anything, and she\u2019d be giving her father the upper hand as he gets her what she wants. However, Nova has demonstrated that she still gets whatever she wants through her dad, so this wouldn\u2019t be a terrible loss for her. \n\nShe should earn the money back. If she doesn\u2019t care to, maybe have her do some Christmas caroling or community service. Say, \u201cactually, you deserve to celebrate Christmas with us,\u201d and get her into the Christmas spirit by giving back. Sounds stupid, I know, but that way she can celebrate Christmas and learn a lesson \u2014 even if she isn\u2019t earning the money physically, putting the time towards something good might be a good way to teach her that her actions have consequences without being too harsh. When I was younger my mother would have us Christmas carol or have us spend time with the people from the retirement homes. I know it doesn\u2019t sound ideal for everyone else who didn\u2019t break an iPad, but you can talk about \u201cstarting the celebration early\u201d and do it before Christmas. If she would rather not pay her share for the iPad or at least demonstrate that she is the slightest bit sorry, then OP, I fear your daughter is a huge AH. At 9, I knew the consequences that came with breaking something of my sister\u2019s, expensive or not. At 14, there is no excuse for that type of apathy.\n\nUnfortunately, Nova is a bit of an AH, not just for breaking the iPad (accidents happen) but for getting a brand new iPad while Oliver\u2019s is broken. This is a pretty crappy thing to do. If you have the money for it, I\u2019d make sure Oliver has a special Christmas. It sounds like he was a good sport about the whole thing, and deserves something extra to commemorate that (you can do this in private so Nova doesn\u2019t feel bad).\n\nBest of luck, OP, I wish you all a relaxing Christmas!", "grounded without wifi\n\nNTA\n\ntell dad she will suffer the consequences of her actions\n\nTeens play divorced parents dad's an idiot falling for it.\n\nShe would also being doing useless physical labor to earn the money.

She's at an age where anger is expected, but getting destructive on others stuff is not acceptable and you are showing her that.  Your solution for her father to pay half was acceptable, as she is the daughter of you both and she damaged another child's property.  You've been spot on from what I can see.  Her father is enabling her to needle you, not much can be done about that disappointment.  She'll find a way to bring the ipad out of her room to flaunt it, you can bet on that.  Once she does, take it away.  I suppose you could also confiscate it as soon as she enters your home with it and tell her she can have it when Oliver has his.", "Yta,\nShe should have consequences if you had proof she broke it on purpose.

She is going to hate you.", "Ehhhhh, gonna say YTA here.\n\nThe daughter ABSOLUTELY needs to replace the broken iPad as that's not acceptable to break your son's belongings.\n\nBut you also don't get to force your Ex to pay for half. That didn't happen under his roof, and frankly, would be impossible to actually enforce it.\n\nThis needs to be where it's taken out of her allowance (if any) or else she can \"pay\" it back by doing extra chores or things at YOUR home where it can be supervised.\n\nShe needs to be responsible, but you cannot fairly punish her because what your Ex chose and frankly isn't actually required to do.", "YTA! You are going a little too far ngl. Like, it's Christmas. You're basically telling your daughter that she is not a part of the family.\n\nBesides, you should have had insurance (like AppleCare) on the iPad anyway.", "YTA. It kinda sounds like you hate your daughter. This is not going to teach her anything.", "I agree that a lesson needs to be learned. I see this as her being rewarded by someone else for being negligent with someone else's property (assuming she didn't break it on purpose) when you're trying to teach her how consequences work, and she seems kind of nonchalant about how Oliver might feel because she's getting what she wants.\n\nOne of my friends went through a similar thing. Her 14 year old son plays baseball, and his stepdad let him use his old baseball gear from when he was in high school. One day, the son accidentally left his bag of gear outside, and it rained, ruining all of the equipment. My friend wanted him to work off the cost for her to replace it  through various chores, but then her sister decided (with good intentions) to buy her son all new equipment. She was livid because she was trying to teach the lesson that if you break someone else's things, you pay for it, and if you can't take care of someone else's things, you get your own. Instead he was rewarded with new gear and probably learned nothing.\n\nI WILL say that there's probably a better way to teach that lesson than grounding her for Christmas. You could tell her you're using the money you would spend on gifts for her to replace the iPad and getting her one or two smaller things (but still get her something, she's just a kid) since she got her \"big gift\" from her dad. \"Grounding\" is more about control than teaching. Also telling her to ask her dad for money to replace it I think is too much, he's not part of this at all and you aren't entitled to ask that of your daughter.\n\nSo, NTA for wanting to make this a teachable moment, but YTA for how you're going about it.", "YTA for oh so many reasons, but let\u2019s start with - you are basing all of this on \u201cOliver THINKS she broke it on purpose\u201d?

Give her dad full custody or you just keeping her around for child support payments?\n\nThere are other ways to punish her IF she did it on purpose or to repay him back if by accident.

The issue is that the daughter is being grounded from celebrating Christmas with her Mom's family *and* being prevented from celebrating with her father. That is simply inappropriate as a punishment.\n\nAnd people aren't suggesting alternative punishments because this isn't an advice sub, it's AITA. But I actually already thought about what reasonable punishments could look like, so here goes:\n\nFirst, it needs to be determined whether she did it maliciously or whether it was an accident.\n\nIf it was an accident, she shouldn't be punished, she is just responsible for *replacing* his iPad (the same model as his was, not a newer one). Many families give kids one big present and a couple small ones for Christmas. If that's how OP's household works, then Nova should not get a big present this year from OP and her stepfather, but should probably still get the small presents (the small presents are not likely to make much of a financial difference, which means it would be gratuitous not to let her have them for something that was an accident). If the family has a tighter budget, they probably only give one present per kid anyway, so then Nova would get no presents.\n\nBut while giving up a Christmas present is a sacrifice for a kid, it's not the same thing as earning money, and having her earn the money through work is a better life lesson. Since it sounds like she is too young to get a real job, she should be doing chores, babysitting, odd jobs, etc. until she earns enough that, combined with the value of her Christmas present(s), she has paid off the iPad.\n\nIf it was malicious, that's a very different problem. She should be grounded (not by being prevented from celebrating Christmas with her family, but by being prevented from hanging out with friends/going out/doing other fun activities), with no TV, phone/internet use limited to necessities, no allowance, not be permitted to use her devices, etc. And OP should have repeated conversations about the importance of treating others with respect until Nova is ready to genuinely apologize to her stepbrother and demonstrate that she is remorseful. \n\nIf she is not remorseful, then OP needs to get her into therapy. Not as punishment, of course, but because this kind of acting out, particularly in a blended family when her Mom still has a contentious relationship with her Dad, it's a sign of more serious emotional/psychological issues.\n\nBut also: OP clearly has a contentious relationship with her ex, to the extent that they needed a court order to determine who Nova spends holidays with. (My own parents came up with a mutually agreeable schedule and put that into their divorce agreement without needing any court input).\n\nWhen you have a relationship like that, it's bizarre to expect your ex to pay for misbehavior that happened in *your* house when *you* were responsible for proper supervision of your kid. \n\nAnd OP didn't even talk to the ex about her proposed punishment herself! One of the worst things for divorced parents to do to their kids is to expect the kids to carry messages back and forth between the parents. So it was unbelievably inappropriate to expect a teenager to tell her father that his ex wants her to ask for money for Christmas to pay for something that broke when his ex was supervising her.", "Yeah, I just don't see any reason to punish her in the first place other than everybody believing another child claiming she was jealous.

It doesn\u2019t\u2019t have to be dollar for dollar - make a list of chores with dollar amounts to be credited, but it could be $10 for cleaning the bathroom, for example.

There's no question that Nova should replace the iPad as I said, but that's not the question.  She's being punished because OP thinks it was done on purpose because Oliver thought so.  So either the punishment is somewhat justified because Nova is generally antagonistic (although OP should figure out why) or it's overkill because Nova gets blamed whether she's at fault or not and she's over her mother's treatment.", "I think we mostly agree here, as an adult if I were at my friends house, used their ipad and accidentally dropped it, which resulted in it being ruined.

And it would be pretty shitty for your half brother to have some fancy electronic when you don't get one, no?

Because keeping the kid entirely out of a family celebration is an extreme punishment for breaking a piece of property (even if it was done intentionally, which the OP hasn't established), OP is definitely TA here.\n\nDivorced parents share financial responsibility for their children, but it doesn't mean they are each on the hook for exactly 50% of every expense a child incurs.  I'm going to say it again, if Nova put a hole in the wall at her Mom's house, I think it would be ridiculous to ask the Dad to pay half for repairs.\n\nNova absolutely needs to learn that there are consequences for things like this, even if it was an accident.  OP's consequences are not commensurate with the severity of the offense.  It seems to me like OP wants to punish Nova extra because her Dad won't comply with what the OP wants.\n\n(In general, I really don't like it when parents of kids under, say, 16 or so write into Reddit to ask if their kids are assholes.  I think that when kids that young are involved, even if they are assholes, they probably caught it from their parents, who are even bigger assholes, and parented them in ways that made them assholes.

Here is one example:\n\n>In states that have vicarious liability laws making a parent/guardian liable for their minor child's driving-related negligence, the injured person would probably only need to show that the parent/guardian had custody of (or control over) the teen driver at the time of the accident.\n\nObviously that assumes they are in the USA so I am really curious if this is different in other countries.\n\nWhile I can absolutely see an argument that morally both parents should be responsible for their kid's behavior outside of their homes when not supervised by a parent, I think that the bar for parental responsibility should be higher for things that happen in their own homes.\n\nAlso, without knowing how it broke, we don't even know if Nora should be responsible. If Oliver did something stupid like leave it on the floor at the top of a staircase or plugged in with the wire extended across a walkway and the iPad teetering on the edge of a surface and Nora accidentally knocked it down then I would say that Oliver losing his iPad was not Nora's fault because he was negligent.", "INFO:\n\n1.

There are two parents in the home where it was broken and those two parents are responsible for paying for a replacement. Whatever punishment they want ti give can only be enacted at their house. Punishment can't be carried over to her father's house without his consent. So in no way should he be expected to pay.", "Why did you assume that Nova broke it?

My don is 21 and hasn\u2019t seen his dad or talked to him since he was 13 this is the road you are heading down.", "NTA \n\nTLDR: I think Nova should have to pay for the iPad whether she broke it on purpose or not. I think mom/OP thinks the same. And I think if Nova getting an iPad was her idea/she went along with to get back at mom/step brother for not getting Christmas gifts/tattling grounding her is reasonable.\n\nWhat I got from the post:\n\nNova broke the iPad (whether that was on purpose or not mom doesn't know and doesn't impact the punishment). The punishment is Nova/her parents have to pay for it (which is something that happens when someone breaks something.)\n\nSo on that front I think it has to do with the mentality. Should just Mom pay, Mom and Dad, or Mom and Step Dad. I think it gets a bit tricky there. Because if it was outside the house Nova broke someone else's thing Mom and Dad should pay equal as her parents. \n\nAfter some thinking I think in this instance Mom/Nova are the only ones who should have to pay (Her house, her kid, her stepkid). If mom thinks Nova should have to pay by herself I think that's fair, but she can't force her ex to pay half(unless she'd try at court but I don't even know if that'd work). So she needs to work that out.\n\n(As I've seen people say Nova can work off the rest of the money on house chores if Christmas money doesn't cover it. I think it'd even be really nice of you to let her decide between Christmas money/presents or more/longer chores. But I get it if you can't really afford to buy a new iPad for your stepson by yourself. I think the best options if you can't afford it would be 1. Ask her dad for half. That didn't work (probably because you tried to force it). So 2. See if anyone else would be willing to \"lend money to your daughter\" (I used quotations but that would pretty much be what's happening. They pay, Daughter works, You pay back). Or if that's not an option either 3. Ask your step son if he would rather get a new iPad now with both his and Nova's Christmas money and get his actual Christmas gifts/money later. Or get Christmas gifts on Christmas and a new iPad when you can afford it (and Nova still works it off)\n\n.\n\nThen there's being grounded. Nova threw a fit (somewhat reasonable as long as she didn't hurt anyone or break anything else and the biggest punishment to me would be sending her to her room till she calms down/for the night).\n\nThen she told her dad and something happened where it was decided Nova would get an iPad for Christmas (like dad could have already decided it/Nova already asked for one before this. Nova could have exaggerated it and Dad fell for it. Or Dad/Nova decided because mom/step brother are getting her punished they'd punish them for it.\n\nEither way Nova getting an iPad from dad for breaking her step brother's is an AH move. If it was Nova's idea to get a new iPad for herself to taunt her step brother/mom then being grounded for awhile is reasonable.\n\nWe have no idea what the custody agreement is so Christmas could be the next time Nova will be over/only time that mom can ground her. Or Nova is currently grounded while at moms house till Christmas is over\n\n(Christmas is a bit much for me so maybe let her out of her room for the day, watch what's on TV, socialize, and eat dinner as a family (maybe even let her wish friends and family Merry Christmas over the phone (especially her dad/any steps/halfs she might have on that side))", "ESH\n\nYou're the AH for trying to force her dad to pay for another kids Ipad. Just because she broke it doesn't mean he is responsible for it, it happened in your house\n\nYour ex is the AH for buying her an Ipad knowing g that she broke another child's Ipad. You may not be able to stop him from doing so but you can implement rules about her not using it in your house", "YTA since you seem to hate your daughter\u2026maybe make her and yourself happy and let her live with her dad.", "YTA because you don\u2019t know the truth. What if you eventually find out it was an accident? Imagine how she would feel knowing she did nothing wrong and you didn\u2019t believe her. You might become one of those NC parents someday.", "YTA. I've read your comments and still don't agree with your actions. Her father isn't responsible for half of the cost of an iPad just because he's her parent. If it was a friend's iPad she broke and she was taking responsibility then maybe it is a conversation that's had that he contribute partially to the replacement, but you don't get to demand it. Also are you buying Oliver a brand new one or a replacement for what he had? New is quite a bit more but if he had an older one you can get used ones all over the place. \nYou CAN restrict use of the iPad at your house. That's your time and you set the rules, not your ex. She just needs access to a phone to call and tell him matey Christmas and say hi when she wants to, or send texts, but she doesn't need to have full technology privileges while she's there. But, that iPad had better be put somewhere it doesn't get damaged while it's out of her control. Your ex will sue you for what? Parenting your child? \n\nNow as to family time at the holidays. That's a fucking stupid way to punish your child! Stay in your room, play on your iPad and don't interact with your family of assholes? That sounds like a dream come true, not a punishment. Have her do chores to earn money foe rhe iPad. Have her help neighbors or family with things to earn money. Don't isolate her. Might I suggest some family therapy?

Maybe for her alone too so she can learn better coping mechanisms than throwing an iPad.", "NTA", "YTA", "YTA, she is not gonna learn any lessons sitting in her room by herself. When I was a kid I wrecked something in the house and I was told I should pay for it.

Let's say she broke the iPad have you asked WHY?  Would that be her normal behavior? Was she acting like a brat if so WHY?

How could anyone tell their child they will spend Christmas alone in her bedroom with no presents.  Wow!", "She told her dad that she was blamed for an accident to Olivers Ipad and dad, who knows what his ex is like decided to not just refuse to pay, but get her an ipad.", "Why did they buy oliver an ipad in the first place? I think if they gave us more info we may think she broke the ipad on purpose, btu its prettey certain we would think they played games of favouritism that caused her to resent Oliver.", ">If a child broke something at school and there was no proof of intent/malice and therefore it was considered an accident, then yes it is likely that the school would have insurance/write it off and that No the parents would not be responsible for paying for it.", "Okay so let's say it was a car and your sixteen year old, with your permission was driving that car to McDonalds.  16 yr old has an accident, car is totaled.  \n\nDoes 16 yr old OWE the price of a brand new car?  Of course not.  At worst, if there was no insurance involved, you might say she has responsibility to pay for the current value of that Used car.\n\nHowever, in real life, parents do not charge a 16 yr old who Accidentally totals a car either the Cost of a new car OR the value of a used car.  Maybe they would charge a deductible. \n\nThe Mother is charging the cost of a Brand new IPAD, not the value of used ipad, not the cost of a refurbished ipad(same model).", "Yeah, but as I mentioned, I expect her to actually TALK to him about it instead of make the teenager go tell him what happened and why he's paying. She's gonna spin it like she did nothing. I also thought about the fact that they really don't know if it was on purpose or not, but that doesn't affect the dollar amount or that she is the one who broke it in any case. But maybe it would deserve some other consequences or response in addition to paying? Not sure", "Bit ironic you ask me for sources then quote stuff without providing sources.\n\n> >In states that have vicarious liability laws making a parent/guardian liable for their minor child's driving-related negligence, the injured person would probably only need to show that the parent/guardian had custody of (or control over) the teen driver at the time of the accident.\n\nCustody here typically means who has legal rights over the kid. Shared custody means parents share custody and rights/duty towards the kid (can be divided up based on a agreement or decree). Doesn\u2019t mean just when they are in their home. [In a shared parenting arrangement, where the child lives an equal or approximately equal amount of time with the mother and father, both are custodial parents and neither is a non-custodial parent.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncustodial_parent).\n\nFor example, one of your parents can\u2019t make sole and complete decisions for you medically just because your medical emergency happens to fall on a Wednesday. Life threatening emergencies may have a case, but one parent can\u2019t just decide to unplug the kid because their custody agreement said they get that day of the week.\n\nPhysical custody over the child would help support a parent\u2019s arguments as to why they should be less responsible for sure, but at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t remove it completely.", "I\u2019m not defending the moms punishment, in fact I think she is over punishing her daughter. Especially because it is clearly in retaliation to her ex husband\u2019s actions. \n\nIf theres a car accident of course the kid isn\u2019t going to pay for the car, insurance (if you have it) should cover it.\n\nBut at the bare minimum, if they were at fault in the accident, they\u2019re not behind the wheel of a car for a long time. Not until they can show they\u2019re responsible enough to be allowed to drive again.", "Yea, I've already edited my post to reply properly, lol.\n\nBut yeah, I wasn't addressing whether it was on purpose or not cause, ultimately, it doesn't really matter. Either way it's broken and her parent's responsibility to replace it, I think.", "YTA. If no adult witnessed it and there is no reason to believe otherwise it was an accident. You're teaching your daughter that you don't trust her and it's going to screw you over hard in the future. \n\nDouble YTA for punishing her for her father's decision to buy an iPad for her.", "OP, how do you know she broke it intentionally? Just because your stepson said so? How do you know he didn't break it and blame YOUR daughter? \n\nAnd you want your daughter to be punished by staying in her room on Christmas, while you celebrate with your husband, younger daughter and stepson?\n\nYou apparently don't think much of your daughter from a previous marriage. You are going to lose her and never see her or any children she may have.\n\nYTA BIG TIME!", "YTA\n\nAnd Nova's dad is an A H.  Giving Nova an iPad isn't helping the actual issue.  It makes it more difficult because he is making sure that he's the good guy while you are going to rely on court ordered things that her dad can't alter.  Sit down and address what is going on with Nova.  Is she jealous? Has someone made her feel like she is not a part of this family? Is she the bully in this situation or did she act out because she is feeling bad?  Banning her from a family celebration isn't going to help anyone.", "Consequences for kids should logically follow from the acts causing the need for discipline. If you break something, you should have to replace it or buy it; so you lose allowance or gifts or have to earn money to replace it.  So your first punishment although odd to rope in her father without his input (I assume by his reaction) is appropriate. Banning her from Christmas is not. That makes you the AH", "YTA Ostracized and alone sitting in her room for something that was probably an accident this little girl is literally alone dealing with internal trauma while you celebrate Christmas doors away from her but without her. \nAt 14 this is going to be solidified in her mind how her mom feels about her and permanently scar her.  \nIf she never speaks to you again once she turns 18 I would not be a bit surprised. You are taking away her Christmas and gloating that she can't see her dad. I sincerely hope that these children remember how petty you were over this (and I'm pretty sure alot more traumatic episodes) when they are choosing your nursing home. Divorced parents who use children as pawns end up losing their child either to their ex (hopefully) or just from the child emotionally or literally disowning them. Did you ask her if it was an accident or did you just believe your step son?  Why are you bragging about keeping a child from her father on Christmas and then taking hers away? I have not spoken to my dad in 10 years and live about an hour away from him. Don't do this to your child. Im speaking from experience my parents used me and my siblings as pawns in their emotional chess game. Just replace his iPad and chalk it up to things get broken, they are just kids  Grow up and move on or let her go live wth her dad. I'm just afraid the damage has already been done if you think this situation is justifiable.", "NTA. Good on your for keeping the boundaries between enabling and self entitlement. Your ex is the enabler and is trying to get the \"cool parent\" award.\n\nI know a lot people will disagree with me, and that's okay. We all have our opinions right?\nPersonally, I think if Nova wants to act like a self entitled brat then she's should be treated like a brat. She's old enough to know right from wrong but chose wrong anyway. Even exasperated the situation by getting her dad to buy her a brand new ipad rather punishing her for destroying something worth over a grand.\nThat's perpetuating an already escalated situation and it sure as hell doesn't help Nova's case. Only puts her in a shittier one. So, it's kind of the dad's fault too.\n\nHonestly, Nova got her Christmas present from her dad. She got what she wanted didn't she? Being grounded and told to stay in her room with her present is not emotional abuse or exclusion. She made her bed, now Nova has to lie in it.\n\nWith that being said ...\n\nI am curious about the jealousy aspect of it. If Nova is jealous, why?\nIs there some underlying issue that hasn't been addressed? Or is she acting out for another reason? Perhaps try to talk her about why she broke ipad. If she doesn't want to or can't explain, maybe getting a family counselor involved can help.\n\nJust a suggestion", "Yta it seem to me it just going to make your daughter hate you for doing this", "YTA. This is the kind of shitty parenting that will lead to Nova needing intense therapy and eventually going LC/NC with you.

Cutting out Christmas gifts from you and your husband is your choice but you can't make that choice for your ex, especially without talking to him.  It's one thing to not give gifts to a misbehaving teen, it's another to lock her in her room and then say, you and your dad can't do anything about it because of a court order.

OP sounds extremely spiteful; feel so sorry for the daughter.", "It's not a little cruel. It's extremely cruel. And you're being WAY too generous in saying that OP has good intentions.

Like if I had a kid who told me their other parent had unilaterally decided they weren't allowed any Christmas presents, including from me, because they accidentally broke something and that she was required to ask me to pay half the cost as a Christmas present to her then I would be tempted to do what the Dad has done. I wouldn't because it would add to the dysfunction but I know a lot of people would do that.", "Nova's dad decided to give his kid a iPad, why a family member couldn't have decided the same for Oliver? It doesn't sound complicated to me that two kids with diferent parents and  extended families get diferent things.", "You are tryingto be charitable to OP over the difference in what the children have that she doesnt explain, while i am suspicious of it, because it isnt explained.\n\nIf OP was answering questions we coudl get her to explain.", "I hope op's ex goes for full custody with OP getting supervised visitation at best.", "Anyone want to bet that the new stepdad is also behind this ruthlessness advocating for his son and most likely vilifying Nova, and OP is just drinking the Koolaid?", "If she got one for Christmas, just make her give it to her brother.
