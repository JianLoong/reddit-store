Damn, you're ruthless. This is cruel. There is no lesson to be learned here - this will only teach her to resent you. She's never going to forget this. Good luck with your relationship with her in the future.", "YTA. You and her dad need to get on the same page before making these decisions - you told her she had to ask her dad for Oliver's ipad money as her Christmas gift and are surprised he didn't acquiesce to your demands? And then you're surprised that while *you* tried to unilaterally decide what he's going to get her for Christmas, that instead he used his money to buy his daughter an ipad, which she wanted?\n\nIt's fine that actions have consequences and that she has to do something to \"make up\" the money for the ipad. Being generally grounded and doing some household chores should be sufficient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you're on Oliver's side here, which it sounds like you are, and there's a possibility Nova broke his ipad out of jealousy, why do you think forcing her to spend the holiday alone is going to change her behavior? You need to address that jealousy issue.", "YTA. This is bad parenting and some wild illogical actions from you. First of all, why do you just take your stepson's word for this being intentional? It could've been an accident for all we know, since you don't give any other reason other than your stepson thinking she did it on purpose.\n\nSecond of all, you have zero right to expect Nova's father to contribute half the money for Oliver's iPad. I was scratching my head at that one. Demanding Nova to ask her father for half the money was absolutely ridiculous. If you want her to cover half the cost, then tell her she needs to get a job, or do chores to earn the money or something.\n\nYou cannot control what Nova's father gets her for Christmas nor how his money is spent. Get that through because it's really wild that you think you have a say over that.\n\nAnd grounding her for Christmas is just cruel. You could've established she has to share her new iPad with Oliver while she's at your house, until she can help buy him a new one. Or that she cannot use it while at yours, if anything. Making her spend the holiday in her room is Dursley-esque crap.\n\n(Edit: I don't know why I had originally typed E S H but I had meant YTA).", "INFO: why is Oliver the only one that had an iPad?", "YTA\n\nI think you have good intentions, but I think your punishment was too harsh to begin with. I also have so many questions. Do you know for sure it wasn't an accident? If you don't, how come you're taking your son's words over your daughter's? Why did he have an ipad and she didn't when they're only a year apart, or why wasn't it shared?\n\nI think a simple apology would've been enough, especially since it's a he said she said scenario from what I gathered. Not only that, you punished HER for HER FATHER not giving her the money to buy your son a new ipad. Christmas or not, I think that's a little cruel.", "Yta\n\nThere are a thousand other ways she can make her repay her damage... And you can keep her iPad from her at your home until she earns enough to replace his IPad.\n\nIt kind of sounds like you don't like your daughter very much. Why does your step son's word that it was jealousy mean more than your daughter's word of accident?\n\nHolidays are family time... By banning her from family celebrations you are tellingnyour daughter than she can not ever mess up or you're kicking her out of the family(time). Kids do dumb shit and things get broken. They are kids. Don't compound the issue by making her feel unloved or unable to make mistakes.\n\nEta: Not to mention... Why is her father paying half and your daughter paying half... Why aren't you all going 3rds in it? Or your ex paying 1/4th, you 1/4th, and your child half? You are just as much as her parent. Why is it your exhusbands responsibility to pay for the iPad that was your step son's and was broken in your home? Why doesn't your gifts to her go to replace the iPad instead of her father's? \n\nWhere do you shop for audacity? That's a lot of ovarian fortitude to try to dictate how your ex is the only grown up required to. contribute financially to replace something he had nothing to do with for a child that isn't his. \n\nIt sounds like you allow a behavioral situation to happen in your home and then take no responsibility for it.\nAnd I still don't know how you know your stepson is not lying but your daughter is?\n\nYou're the super sized asshole.", "YTA. Christmas day and the whole gifting thing should be immune from punishment. Forcing daughter to beg dad for money for Christmas so she can turn around and give it to Oliver is wrong because it leaves her without gifts.

So she should be expected to help replace it. \n\nNot your EX. Your ex didn't take the iPad. And yes, having your ex give your daughter the money to pay for the iPad means he is paying for the iPad. \n\nInstead, you should have had her do extra chores to work it off. Or diminished her allowance or something. You gave her an adult punishment then penalized her because she couldn't pay the fee. Now you're mad that she's mad that you made her pay for something and then punished her when she couldn't pay it. \n\nWelcome to the American penal system. Where the low-earning get one speeding ticket, can't pay it, then get pulled up in court with more fines because they miss the deadline to pay it, then have a warrant out for their arrest, get put in jail, miss work, lose their job, and still can't pay the ticket. \n\nIt doesn't work for adults.

Find a way for her to earn the money, perhaps by doing chores, to buy a new iPad for Oliver.  It sounds like it was accidental.  You can't control her Dad or what he does for her for Christmas.  You can make the iPad stay at her dad's, but prepare to see less of her.  Don't ground her over Christmas. That's ridiculous.", "YTA: she gets grounded to her room while you enjoy Christmas with the rest of the family?", "Info: You didn't discuss the punishment with your  ex husband that you \\*included\\* him in?????", "YTA, nice creating a memory of you hating her during Christmas, you know she probably will never forget this and will always hold it against you.", "YTA. First, you can\u2019t control what her father gets her for Christmas so demanding he give her money to replace the iPad was never going to work. Second, if she did indeed break it on purpose, there are other ways to have her pay for a new one that have nothing to do with ruining her Christmas. \n\nWhich brings me to; she claims it was an accident but her step brother \u201cbelieves\u201d it was due to jealousy. So you don\u2019t really have proof it was intentional and have just decided the step brother was correct. Maybe he is, but did you sit down and talk with both of them to see if you could find out exactly how it happened? \n\nChristmas gifts should not be used as punishment. If you are hell bent she must pay for a new iPad, have her do chores around the home to \u201cearn\u201d the funds.", ">She claimed it was an accident but Oliver believes she did it out of jealousy\n\nWell, which was it? You are the parent... You don't get to just abdicate responsibility for figuring out if you are dealing with your daughter maliciously destroying her stepbrother's things (in which case, just requiring her to replace it monetarily is incredibly insufficient as a punishment *and* you probably need to get her/the whole family into counseling immediately) or whether you are dealing with a legitimate mistake (in which case, you should be talking to her about responsibility and helping her find a way to to earn the money herself, not gratuitously punishing her for being a teenager who doesn't have much money).\n\nBut regardless of which situation it is, YTA for using Christmas as a punishment *and* for attempting to make your ex contribute to an item that was broken when your daughter was *your* responsibility, not his.", "YTA Christmas is about spending time with family. Yes she deserves punishment but banning xmas isn't the way.  Ban her from.using electronics while at your house and make her leave her iPad at her dads.", "YTA YTA YTA\n\nunless you can prove without a doubt that Nova broke Oliver\u2019s iPad on purpose (which you obviously can\u2019t because you said he believes she did it out of jealousy, not that you know) why are you so set on believing him over her? \n\nTo tell her she has to ask her dad for the money to replace it is ridiculous.

Teen years are tough because kids overreact about every little thing, and I DO believe they deserve to have consequences. That being said, you are only a kid for so long during Christmastime and to completely ruin an entire Christmas for her while she is still a child is beyond messed up.

She clearly doesn't understand why it's her responsibility to reimburse you for that. Forcing her to reimburse you for the iPad is not going to make her any more clear to her why should she, so she's not going to do it by herself next time. If jealousy was the problem, her dad already messed the lesson up by buying her one.\n\nTbh I don't know how would I deal with this situation. Try and talk to her open-mindedly and see how she feels. If she really believes it was an accident and isn't lying about that, perhaps she believes it's unfair to be so severely punished for something she didn't have any intention of doing? Maybe ask her how would she feel if you accidentally broke her new iPad that she is getting and would she want you to get her a new one if that happened. Would she think it was very different whether it was an accident or not, or would she just want you to fix the damage you caused regardless?\n\nIf it wasn't an accident and she knows it, that's a bit more difficult. I guess it depends on why she's jealous. It's a much deeper problem.\n\nBut either way, I don't think punishment is going to solve her wrong mindset here. If anything, it might make her even more jealous and resentful for you to spend Christmas with Oliver and without her. If she felt jealous in the first place because she feels neglected, you're going to severely exacerbate the issue.\n\nI agree that realistic consequences are appropriate, but I think forcing them by using your power over her isn't likely to be productive. You have to get her on board somehow.", "ESH.  Making Nova replace Oliver\u2019s iPad?  Fine.  Demanding her dad pay for half of it?  Not really sure why you\u2019re surprised the lesson she took from that is that she should just go to him to fix her problems.  Forcing her to stay in her room for Christmas?  Even Scrooge would call that cold.  \n\nTake several steps back and refocus this on the actual problem, which is replacing Oliver\u2019s iPad in the short term, and in the longer term fixing this hostility between the kids.  None of which is going to be helped by how this has shaken out so far.", "ESH\n\nObviously your daughter screwed up ... but the punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime. What exactly do you think her sitting in her room, without any gifts will accomplish? Certainly, won\u2019t fix Oliver\u2019s iPad problem. I think a better punishment may be that the iPad stays at Dad\u2019s house until Oliver gets his replaced. She can keep it, just not at your house.\n\nYour ex is an AH for allowing her to get away with this behavior. You both clearly have a problem communicating regarding parenting your daughter\n\neta \u2014 regardless of whether or not this was an accident... if you use someone else\u2019s stuff & it breaks... you replace it. Period. It is not appropriate nor kind to get yourself a new one & while the other person\u2019s item is still broken!", "YTA", "Almost ESH. To be fair, there is no easy way to deal with a situation such as this without needing to be a bit of an asshole. I think you had the right intentions for Oliver and I think it\u2019s great that you advocate for your stepson \u2014 but I think there were some things that could have been done differently. Either way, respect for aiming to be fair.\n\nHer father is definitely an asshole for not caring how Nova\u2019s actions effect other people \u2014 she did something pretty bad and the fact that he\u2019s rewarding her for that sucks, so I do feel you on that, OP. \n\nBut you are a slight AH for assuming her dad would cough up money for a situation he wasn\u2019t apart of \u2014 did you try talking to him about it prior to telling your daughter he\u2019d be putting $$$ towards getting Oliver his new iPad? In a way, you\u2019re punishing Nova because her dad is choosing to celebrate Christmas with her (albeit in a crappy way). \n\nHonestly, at 14 I had friends selling snacks, crocheted items, chocolate, even duck taped wallets \u2014 when there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way, and making her earn the money is going to be the best learning lesson. Cancelling Christmas for her might be too extreme, and I can see that backfiring because she\u2019d most likely be mad at you without learning anything, and she\u2019d be giving her father the upper hand as he gets her what she wants. However, Nova has demonstrated that she still gets whatever she wants through her dad, so this wouldn\u2019t be a terrible loss for her. \n\nShe should earn the money back. If she doesn\u2019t care to, maybe have her do some Christmas caroling or community service. Say, \u201cactually, you deserve to celebrate Christmas with us,\u201d and get her into the Christmas spirit by giving back. Sounds stupid, I know, but that way she can celebrate Christmas and learn a lesson \u2014 even if she isn\u2019t earning the money physically, putting the time towards something good might be a good way to teach her that her actions have consequences without being too harsh. When I was younger my mother would have us Christmas carol or have us spend time with the people from the retirement homes. I know it doesn\u2019t sound ideal for everyone else who didn\u2019t break an iPad, but you can talk about \u201cstarting the celebration early\u201d and do it before Christmas. If she would rather not pay her share for the iPad or at least demonstrate that she is the slightest bit sorry, then OP, I fear your daughter is a huge AH. At 9, I knew the consequences that came with breaking something of my sister\u2019s, expensive or not. At 14, there is no excuse for that type of apathy.\n\nUnfortunately, Nova is a bit of an AH, not just for breaking the iPad (accidents happen) but for getting a brand new iPad while Oliver\u2019s is broken. This is a pretty crappy thing to do. If you have the money for it, I\u2019d make sure Oliver has a special Christmas. It sounds like he was a good sport about the whole thing, and deserves something extra to commemorate that (you can do this in private so Nova doesn\u2019t feel bad).\n\nBest of luck, OP, I wish you all a relaxing Christmas!", "grounded without wifi\n\nNTA\n\ntell dad she will suffer the consequences of her actions\n\nTeens play divorced parents dad's an idiot falling for it.\n\nShe would also being doing useless physical labor to earn the money.

She's at an age where anger is expected, but getting destructive on others stuff is not acceptable and you are showing her that.  Your solution for her father to pay half was acceptable, as she is the daughter of you both and she damaged another child's property.  You've been spot on from what I can see.  Her father is enabling her to needle you, not much can be done about that disappointment.  She'll find a way to bring the ipad out of her room to flaunt it, you can bet on that.  Once she does, take it away.  I suppose you could also confiscate it as soon as she enters your home with it and tell her she can have it when Oliver has his.", "Yta,\nShe should have consequences if you had proof she broke it on purpose.

She is going to hate you.", "Ehhhhh, gonna say YTA here.\n\nThe daughter ABSOLUTELY needs to replace the broken iPad as that's not acceptable to break your son's belongings.\n\nBut you also don't get to force your Ex to pay for half. That didn't happen under his roof, and frankly, would be impossible to actually enforce it.\n\nThis needs to be where it's taken out of her allowance (if any) or else she can \"pay\" it back by doing extra chores or things at YOUR home where it can be supervised.\n\nShe needs to be responsible, but you cannot fairly punish her because what your Ex chose and frankly isn't actually required to do.", "YTA! You are going a little too far ngl. Like, it's Christmas. You're basically telling your daughter that she is not a part of the family.\n\nBesides, you should have had insurance (like AppleCare) on the iPad anyway.", "YTA. It kinda sounds like you hate your daughter. This is not going to teach her anything.", "I agree that a lesson needs to be learned. I see this as her being rewarded by someone else for being negligent with someone else's property (assuming she didn't break it on purpose) when you're trying to teach her how consequences work, and she seems kind of nonchalant about how Oliver might feel because she's getting what she wants.\n\nOne of my friends went through a similar thing. Her 14 year old son plays baseball, and his stepdad let him use his old baseball gear from when he was in high school. One day, the son accidentally left his bag of gear outside, and it rained, ruining all of the equipment. My friend wanted him to work off the cost for her to replace it  through various chores, but then her sister decided (with good intentions) to buy her son all new equipment. She was livid because she was trying to teach the lesson that if you break someone else's things, you pay for it, and if you can't take care of someone else's things, you get your own. Instead he was rewarded with new gear and probably learned nothing.\n\nI WILL say that there's probably a better way to teach that lesson than grounding her for Christmas. You could tell her you're using the money you would spend on gifts for her to replace the iPad and getting her one or two smaller things (but still get her something, she's just a kid) since she got her \"big gift\" from her dad. \"Grounding\" is more about control than teaching. Also telling her to ask her dad for money to replace it I think is too much, he's not part of this at all and you aren't entitled to ask that of your daughter.\n\nSo, NTA for wanting to make this a teachable moment, but YTA for how you're going about it.", "YTA for oh so many reasons, but let\u2019s start with - you are basing all of this on \u201cOliver THINKS she broke it on purpose\u201d?

Give her dad full custody or you just keeping her around for child support payments?\n\nThere are other ways to punish her IF she did it on purpose or to repay him back if by accident. And her dad no longer has to agree to your punishment style, especially when it comes to his own money. \n\nHe can choose how his own daughter makes up the money.\n\nShe could have earned the money through extra chores until she made it all up.
