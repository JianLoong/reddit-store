Let\u2019s simplify things a lot - you can be a \u201cWoman of Awesome\u201d on my special day, and a revered guest. If you feel up to doing all the other things the bridesmaids are officially doing then let me know along the way ,but don\u2019t feel compelled to do any of it, because you are special to me without having to participate to prove it. When you are up to things, welcome! When you aren\u2019t\u2026 I totally undersatnd! And if your plans change, you are still my Woman of Awesome, and will still totally be there at my wedding\u201d and let it be.", "YWBTA if you ask her to step down. You can have whatever opinion about the wisdom of her plans, but their impact on your wedding is a non-issue. Tell her that if she gets pregnant and wants to step down for her own comfort or health, you will understand, but you would be thrilled to have her stand up beside you on your wedding day regardless of whether or not she is pregnant or how much she is able to participate in any pre-wedding festivities. Don\u2019t ruin a friendship over someone maybe not drinking at your bachelorette or attending a Vegas weekend or whatever.", "I had a pregnant (and a post partem!) bridesmaid. It truly did not affect the wedding because I was just so happy she was there (she traveled many timezones to come). Promise, you will be just as married afterward had your bridesmaid not been carrying a stowaway.", "INFO What is it that she needs to do to support you that you think is impacted ? Show up to the rehearsal, bachelorette (which isn\u2019t the end of the world if she skips) and the wedding itself.\n\nAnything else and you\u2019re doing too much because wedding design and other details can certainly be done by you/fiance, family and other friends.\n\nSo what\u2019s the actual issue?", "Why would it be bad to have a pregnant bridesmaid? Are you worried about how she will look? Are you afraid she will steal attention? How is she not able to support you the way you need her to?", "TBH it sounds like she\u2019s trying to convince you to ask her to step down, by talking up all the barriers she\u2019s expecting. No idea why; either she wants to feel committed to her plan, or she wants to make you look bad when you ask her to step down, or she wants to make you look really bad if you ask her to step down later. She sounds problematically off-kilter anyway, with this plan. So NTA, but I think you\u2019re going to have to play it very carefully to avoid looking like you\u2019re TA. Having a go-nogo date to decide based on her situation should be a good approach.", "For starts, You should pick your bridesmaids because they are the people you want by your side through it all, so to me this seems like a silly reason to want a bridesmaid to step down.   \n\n\nNext, she's only talking about it. She isn't pregnant, it can take MONTHS to YEARS to get pregnant. My brother and his wife have been trying 3 years now with no luck, so as much as she \"plans\" this, it most likely won't be what happens. Plus her timeline and such of it all makes it seems like she doesn't actually know what she wants to begin with so, wouldn't worry about it until something actually does happen.  \n\n\nAsk yourself before deciding: Is this worth potentially ending your friendship over?  \n\n\nNot really about if your an AH or not, so no vote here.", "I was a maid of honour 10 days after giving birth.

IM OLD AF and id prob keep my mouth shut but Id 100% be fighting the urge to discourage her from making such a huge  lifelong commitment with a guy she barely knows. Fully realizing its prob not likely gonna really happen and none Of my business and I KNOW thats JUST how we do things now and all that. YOUR WEDDING IS THE LEAST OF HER ISSUES.  Youre right tho. If this all goes south she would not be able to SUPPORT YOU now would she.", "YTA. Her timeline is pretty optimistic and feels rushed, but whatever. You seem pessimistic and rushing to kick her out for something that hasn't even happened. \n\nWill she have to travel for the wedding or is she local? The chances of her getting pregnant with a due date +/- 2 weeks of your wedding are pretty slim. If she's massively pregnant, why is that a problem? If she has a newborn she brings to the wedding, why is that a problem?\n\nHer job as a bridesmaid is to show up on the day in a dress you approve and stand at your side while you get married. Until you know she can't do that, assume she can.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m confused by the timeline. If she wants to get engaged, married, and then have the baby and her wedding would be 4 months after yours, she definitely wouldn\u2019t be 38 weeks pregnant at your wedding. \n\nWhen is your wedding? Chances are not high that she will get pregnant immediately; it can take quite a while, so this may be a non-issue. \n\nI think if you asked her to step down, YWBTA. But you could also just have a conversation with her about your concerns since you are good enough friends that you asked her to be a bridesmaid.", "What kills me about all of this is the timeline. Get pregnant,  engages, marry and baby all \u201cwithin a year.\u201d\n\nTechnically, the baby will determine that schedule. Approximately nine months, but 7 to 8 at times.  \n\nGood luck to all", "Simply being a pregnant bridesmaids isn\u2019t a big issue as long as everyone figures out what expectations need to be. \n\nBut Are we gonna gloss over how weird of a timeline this woman is assuming without being pregnant or engaged already. Sounds more like an attention grab than a heads up to a friend.\n\nI think you can absolutely play the \u201cpregnant wouldn\u2019t bother me so let\u2019s see how it plays out so we know what to expect\u201d card.", "I\u2019m sure her boyfriend and future baby will completely stick to her very reasonable timeline.", "Yta. You don't need so much support that someone else can't be excited about their own life. You're not grieving a parent, you're having a wedding. If you need THAT much support, lean on your fiance.", "Wait until she gets pregnant", "What\u2019s the big deal? A pregnant bridemaid is just as much a friend as a non pregnant one.", "She\u2019s been with this guy 6 months? Psh. They may break up before their fairy tale pregnancy-engagement-wedding-divorce.\n\nMaybe she gets pregnant, maybe she doesn\u2019t. Asking her to step down because of the idea of a potential pregnancy seems ridiculous. It can take healthy couples a year to conceive!\n\nThat being said, if she does end up pregnant \nand her due date is around your wedding timeframe, then it would be perfectly acceptable to ask her to step down.\n\nESH.", "Eh, why don't you see if she actually gets pregnant before asking her to step down? For all you know it might take months and won't be an issue.", "INFO: Is she the MOH or just a bridesmaid?", "NTA\u2014but do not delay .The longer you wait to ask the more it will sting .", "Out of curiosity, how pregnant and postpartum were they? I don\u2019t have children so I don\u2019t know what the body does at these points. I do know that a 38-40 weeks she probably shouldn\u2019t be traveling.", "Showing up to the wedding in a dress that fits and standing through the ceremony would be difficult at 38-40 weeks pregnant. Not to mention the reception. Your whole body hurts at that point in the pregnancy, and you could literally go into labor at any moment. You also start weekly drs appointments at 36 weeks.", "Not understanding how asking her to step down from the wedding so we can each continue planning our futures without direct involvement is contradictory, but go off.", "Asking her to put her life on pause would be asking her to delay getting pregnant. OP is concerned about the feasibility of having a ready to pop bridesmaid which is a fair and reasonable thing to consider.", "Correct, and she\u2019d still be invited to the wedding as I\u2019m not unfriending her. Being a bridesmaid is more pressure and responsibility than just being a guest/friend.", "This is true, and not a bad idea. It\u2019ll put the other girls in a crunch planning and payment wise if she does need to drop out unexpectedly (some things were already paid and booked with group rates that depend on an exact headcount), but we could just cross that bridge when we get there.", "Why should she be kicked out? And how do you figure doing it before the \"reason\" has even crystallized will make it sting less?", "How far would she have to travel? I would\u2019ve been fine in the car for an hour or so up until the literal day I gave birth. Regardless, I wouldn\u2019t worry about this until she actually falls pregnant. It may take her months and none of this would matter", "Second trimester, so could travel. She definitely needed a dress with a loose/flowy midsection! But in my case I told my bridesmaids to pick a dress that was dark purple and I didn't care how it looked beyond that. They all looked great and it was a fantastic day. Remember, these are some of your closest friends, not props for pictures.", "I was a bridesmaid at 37 weeks. But my travel was within 20 minutes of my house. How far is she traveling", "You could have your attendants walk the aisle, then sit in front row.", "Is it? I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid and had bridesmaids. There were no responsibilities in either case except get a dress and show up. Theres only pressure if you put it on your bridesmaids.", "Tons of women work full time jobs until days before birth. Can she really not handle it?", "What kind of pressure and responsibilities are you putting on your bridesmaids? It shouldn't be that stressful of a role.", "Agreed. It took us a year of actually trying to get pregnant before we did. Just because she has a plan doesn't mean the plan will take shape.", "How expensive is everything? Surely One persons fee divided by x number should surely make it a few tens each (max)?", "I\u2019d practice letting these comments roll off your back like water on a duck. It\u2019s all talk and who knows if they even can get pregnant on their timeline. She\u2019s enamored with the fantasy of this really shortsighted plan. The best way to thrive in your wedding planning/execution is to lower the volume on worry/concern/stress/drama of reacting to how others\u2019 choices affect wedding plans, etc.\n\nBarring an outburst. None of these things that feel like some big deal now will actually feel that way after the wedding. You\u2019ll be happier to be easy breezy and roll with the hiccups as they happen. Congratulations! I hope your friend takes 6 months to get pregnant (for many reasons!) \ud83d\ude05", "I appreciate the encouragement! And yes, I\u2019d have to agree with you there"]}
