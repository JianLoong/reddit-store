You need to get everything lined up NOW. Be ready to open a new bank account without your parents on it (only if your current account is a shared account) and do it at a bank they have no connection with so that they can't \"convince\" friendly teller to let them have access anyway, get all your important documents into YOUR hands and safe (away from them, use a friends house if you can't get a safe deposit box) most important being SS, birth certificate, and passport but also anything else you think might be important (transcripts, etc.).

If your name isn't on the title, you might as well tell them that since they have the right to take \"your\" car from you for any reason and at any time, you need your half of the payment back since it clearly isn't your car after all.
