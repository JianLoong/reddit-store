You need to get everything lined up NOW. Be ready to open a new bank account without your parents on it (only if your current account is a shared account) and do it at a bank they have no connection with so that they can't \"convince\" friendly teller to let them have access anyway, get all your important documents into YOUR hands and safe (away from them, use a friends house if you can't get a safe deposit box) most important being SS, birth certificate, and passport but also anything else you think might be important (transcripts, etc.). Is your name on the car title or is it only your parent's names? If your name isn't on the title, you might as well tell them that since they have the right to take \"your\" car from you for any reason and at any time, you need your half of the payment back since it clearly isn't your car after all. You need to be ready to implement as much on your 18th birthday (specifically the banking stuff) as possible. If you can't do it on your birthday, you need to do it the soonest feasible time you can. It's unfortunate that these are recommendations you usually find being given to people in abusive and toxic situations, but it is still good and important information and it sounds like you are in that type of situation. What worries me the most is that your parents are taking the things that you bought with YOUR money (btw...theft) AND your card (theft again if the account is only in your name) so that you can't use your money anyway. Please check your bank statements or with your bank to make sure the right amount of money is in your account. I wouldn't put it past your parents to be using your card to either \"reimburse\" themselves for these trips, or to pay for the food etc. with your card once they take it from you.
