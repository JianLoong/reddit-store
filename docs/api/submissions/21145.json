I didn't know how long I'd last (I kept my housing in another state and worked remotely), and I wanted to create a bond with nephew, knowing I live far apart and this might be our only chance. So, I spent our time together playing/learning, even when I was cooking or doing most housework, all for free. I have a degree in early childhood education, which helped. When on his mom's watch, she was busy or on phone, and he'd come back, knocking on my door. Turning him away felt wrong.\n\nMy brother told me once that I should be 'busy' too, because my being fun made my nephew like me more. I said that I wanted him to feel like a priority but feelings were not comparable: she was the mom, I was just the fun aunt. She once asked me to be firm. I explained that I respect her authority as a mom, but 1) I was firm, and 2) I couldn't disrespect *his* autonomy. She might force a diaper change or sweep him up when he didn't want to move. I would wait for him to agree. These were the only instances of them expressing any concern.\n\nStill, when I left, she thanked me. She said she had been able to leave her son for 2 months and visit her ailing dad before he was too sick to enjoy time together. I thanked her for a chance to bond with my nephew.

She had a ridiculous excuse (I answered nephew's question about 'what is a church'), uncalled for (it was a neutral answer and I did not know it was an off-limits topic, seeing nephew HAD been in church with her), and refused to talk it out.

I understand teaching kids bodily autonomy, god I do, but you bet if my niece has a stinky nappy and it needs changing, I\u2019m not going to wait until she says I can, she gets changed so she isn\u2019t sitting in her own shit? \n\nNTA BTW, you are only the fun aunt (I am too) the only reason the mother is being like this is jealousy", "I work in childcare and we see kids cry all the time when they leave their loving teachers and don\u2019t want to go home.

You can't do that and not expect consequences. You may not agree with them but for all the fun aunts and uncles are, they are also disposable. They are not essential and if they are not following a parents instructions then you can be removed from the child's life.\n\nAlso as a parent I can tell you it's really annoying when mine and my husbands siblings use to swan in and be super 'fun' while mum and dad were the ones sitting in the car each night driving around and around the block cause it was the only way to get my eldest to sleep.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had forgiven them before -but this one has hurt more.", "I did kind of wonder about that but then I'm a uncle (nephew is mid 30's now) and grandparent, never ever thought to ask the child about changing a diaper but new generations have their own quirks at least that was my thought,", "Kids generally don't *like* their nappies being wet or dirty; if they're accustomed to being asked, they're going to cooperate. The kids who *don't* cooperate are the ones who've learned that diaper change time is when somebody physically manhandles them, undresses them without permission, and pays no attention to the kid's timing -- like, if you wait five minutes, mama, my show will be done and I'll be happy. As an adult, I don't jump when someone snaps their fingers without regard for my time ... but kids are expected to put up with it just because they're little.", "I get people who can't wait, especially parents -they are busy, they can't stand the stink, they think a 2-year old can't reason really... and honestly, I am not sure how it would have felt if I had to wait for 30 minutes with a stinky diaper around, but I never had to wait more than 5 on that... so I guess I was lucky. Also, I think it's even more important for non-parents to reinforce bodily autonomy. That was the reason for mentioning, that I was making this distinction that I am only the fun aunt and as a fun aunt, I can't just hold a kid down and change their diaper while they are screaming... his mom can, I can't.", "Ahh those type of people, this information make me sure if I were you I'd cut them out of my life entirely, I'd even make sure my parents knew if they were there I would not be. Been there, done that and people that tried to circumvent that learned the hard way not to lie to me that they wouldn't be there when they already invited.", "I am so sorry you have such a shitty brother, who found an equally shitty partner. Your nephew was lucky to have you in his life, and I'm sure he will know he has shit parents as he grows up. You're absolutely NTA and I'm sure no one would judge you if you went no contact to protect yourself from such emotional abuse from them in the future.", "Understood on the screaming part, and I do totally understand the perspective on autonomy again, I just know my SIL already leaves my niece in dirty nappies far longer then needed, and will quite happily never change her if there is someone else, so I guess different family dynamics at play is all", "Totally get this too :-)"]}
