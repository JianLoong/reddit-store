{"id": 7274, "submission_id": "10baesp", "title": "AITA for \"bullying\" my son's teacher?", "selftext": "I (41F) have a son (13M) in middle school. He's always been a good student and has never struggled with material or grades. He tested into all advanced classes this year, 7th grade, and has been successful in all of them . . . except for his social studies class.\n\nHis teacher is \"Mr. Brown.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the students were asked to draw 20 people as homework. He instructed them on how to draw \"Mr. Handy\" a character that he created that is easy to draw, but more detailed than a stick figure (premise of the assignment being he wants \"no stick figures\" in class). My son DOES draw, so he did the 20 drawings, but with greater detail. He was very proud and obviously trying to impress his teacher. He got back a C- because they were not \"Mr. Handy.\"\n\nThen they were asked to fill in a map in legible font, with black ink, and include landmarks. Again, my son took much longer than usual to write everything out clearly. Another \"C-.\" The reasoning? He didn't use \"black ink.\" He used a pencil.\n\nI asked my son to do his best but let me know if anything else happened. Over the course of the semester, I did notice that while he was usually well-behaved, he started getting detention and low grades -- but just with Mr. Brown. He got detention for \"swearing.\" (He said \"that sucks\" to a friend in the hallway, where Mr. Brown overheard.) For detention, he had to write lines, and then an essay about what he learned about \"not swearing\" from the detention. My son wrote the essay about how he had \"learned nothing\" and received... another detention.\n\nFinally, my son gets his semester grades back in that class. A \"D.\" I was floored. Despite all the grades I'd seen, none were THAT low. I agreed to a conference with Mr. Brown, and frankly was already peeved.\n\nWe discussed everything above. Mr. Brown recommended my son move into the non-advanced class. I asked how he ended up with a \"D.\" Apparently, at the end of the semester, Mr. Brown called all the kids in to ask what they thought they deserved in his class, while looking through a portfolio of their assignments. My son said at first \"I don't know,\" to which Mr. Brown said \"what do you think I would give you?\" And my son told him he thought he would \"fail him.\" Well, he used that score instead of his accumulated homework score for his homework. So if you combine my son's test scores and his \"you'd fail me\" comment -- he fails the class.\n\nI admittedly was nasty in my response (I told him it was the most \"insane\" thing I'd heard from a teacher and asked if he cared about his students). After the discussion, he informed me that I was a \"bully\" and that my son was adopting and would continue to adopt my \"behavior,\" resulting in him being an \"unsuccessful student.\" \n\nI wrote to the principal outlining all of this and requesting they hire a new teacher so no other students in the future have to suffer this.

NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis definitely needs to be addressed with the principal and his counselor. The teacher sounds like he is being petty and targeting your kid.\n\nI would request copies of all of his actual tests and scores, and have them regraded by another teacher.", "NTA. But I would use this as an example to show your son that there is always going to be someone in his life, even authority figures, that might not like him or might try to make his life harder just for the hell of it. He should do his best to stand up for himself but also realize that some people feel so bad about their own lives that they have nothing better to do than take it out on everyone else. It doesn't usually have anything to do with him. \n\nMy mom did that for me when I had a shitty teacher and it helped me accept that it wasn't my problem, that me trying hard enough wasn't the issue - it was out of my hands and I should continue being the best version of myself regardless. You're not a bully. You're a good mom standing up for your kid. He's lucky to have you in his corner.", "NTA. This teacher is doing WAY too much. Asking a student what grade they should get is stupid. Your son over doing the drawings should have gotten him extra credit, not less. Using the wrong writing material should AT MOST constitute 1/2 grade downgrade (B+ -> B). This teacher simply doesn\u2019t like your son it sounds like.", "What the heck? \n\nWhy is your kid\u2019s teacher trying to make him draw certain characters? This isn\u2019t even art- it\u2019s *social studies*. \n\nYour kid\u2019s teacher apparently has it out for him. Why don\u2019t you make this a bigger deal by taking all of this to the school board? This guy has no business even being a teacher. They should revoke his license.\n\nNTA.", "How is a junior high school social studies class getting 'draw people' as an assignment? That's.... not social studies?\n\nThe teacher is clearly off the wall, and out of line.\n\nMake sure that grade gets overturned.\n\nNTA", "NTA - this teacher is a bully. Maybe he really didn't like that your son ignored directions, but he could have handled it in a way that acknowledged the effort your son was putting in.\n\nThe grade thing is absolutely insane. Your son was right Mr. Brown probably wanted to fail him and used your son's awareness of that as an excuse to do it. He sounds like a teacher who kills a student's desire to learn.", "NTA. Ask to have a sit down conference with the principal and said teacher. The teacher had absolutely no merit to insinuate you or your child have bully \u201ctendencies\u201d. You asked a valid question, and as a parent noticing your hard-working child is TRYING to impress the teacher, you should be given a thorough explanation why that teacher isn\u2019t being receptive to it. Had an elementary school teacher call me liar, had me in tears. My dad went up there the next day for a \u201cconference\u201d and absolutely tore her a new one.", "In regards to the black ink issue I actually get why he was marked down, specific instructions were given and he didn't follow them. If the teacher says you have to use black ink, you use black ink, end of. With the Mr Handy issue, was there any written instructions? Were they told they were supposed to use Mr Handy? Did the other kids in the class use Mr Handy? I feel there is a bit of info missing here.", "NTA I'm gonna be honest, I would have snapped his spine like a twig when he said the \"what do you think I should give you comment\". Better person than me. The ink thing I kinda get specific instructions and all that, but what does drawing a \"Mr. Handy\" have do do with advanced social studies in 7th grade? It makes you think Mr. Brown might have something against your son.", "NTA. Funny that he chose the word \"bully\". That's exactly what I would call his behavior toward your son. He sounds like a sad, small man with a superiority complex. Who knows how many other students he is harassing everyday?\n\nGood for you for speaking up. A kid with no other conflicts and good grades in all his other advanced courses doesn't suddenly morph into Satan upon the threshold of Mr. Brown's class. Mr. Brown is most likely the real problem here.", "Definitely NTA. Matter of fact, you were a lot calmer than I would've been! The bully here is the teacher and not you. Do not let this one go. Your son deserves better than this \"teacher\".", "NTA.  You need to sit down with the principal and discuss face to face.  Politely, no drama, just the facts.  Tell the principal you believe Mr. Brown is bullying your son.  The principal will probably support the teacher to some extent.  You're not going to fix the D, but you can get your kid back in the advanced class, and you can have your kid not be in this teacher's class.\n\nIt would be helpful if you can get information from other parents to back you up.", "NTA- I would crawl up the principal\u2019s ass and nest there until some action was taken on this one. I get docking kids for not following directions- but this is ridiculous.", "NTA but be prepared to not be supported when you go to the principal. It\u2019s really important when dealing with these sort of \u201ctough\u201d teachers to start emailing, questioning, and documenting every issue from the get go. \n\nI don\u2019t know what it is about middle school, but it really attracts these teachers who feel they are preparing kids for the real world by being petty and cruel. Learning to jump through hoops set up by the teacher prepares them to be \u201cgood employees\u201d and quite frequently admin agree with them. \n\nYes, it\u2019s important for your son to follow directions carefully on his assignments. You could have immediately asked for clarification on what portion of the deduction from his grade was based on the incorrect drawing or pen/pencil. If your son only earned a B and he was dropped half a letter that\u2019s not wildly unfair. Come prepared to your meeting/conversation with the principal with the questions and clarifications you want written down and try to stay calm. \n\nOn another note if your son shows he\u2019s intelligent, but struggles with those sort of small parts of instructions it\u2019s worth checking if he has a learning disability like ADHD or processing disorder. If he does there will be legally binding accommodations teachers have to follow through the rest of his school years. Bright kids often get overlooked for these because they still do well grade wise, but not being diagnosed and learning to handle it can lead to some real problems in adult life.", "This is obviously a one sided story and there could be more to it.\n\nHowever, I strongly believe we need to be our children's advocates. If you feel the teacher behaviour is not acceptable, whether you are right or not, you should escalate the discussion and meet with the principal. I wouldn't go as far as asking him to fire a teacher over email, but would definetly have an in person conversation to explain your POV and hear what he has to say.\n\nNTA", "NTA I could understand the no ink and no Mr handy thing but sucks isn't a curse and of course he learned nothing because he didn't curse, I don't understand the grading system he is using and I don't know enough to say bullying or not but seems like this teacher is odd with his grading system", "NTA - Oh hell no. Call the school back and threaten to get a lawyer involved if this teacher does not re-calculate his grade.", "ESH. Teacher here. Your son\u2019s teacher is clearly a control freak who decided to take your son down a peg. But you are doing your son no favors by teaching him to ignore the directions and be a smartass. \n\n\u201cI learned nothing from consequences for rude language\u201d is the direct result of you teaching your son to disrespect authority. His attitude (which you encourage) may seem harmless or justified here, but he needs to learn to just do the assignment. That\u2019s going to be a hard, expensive lesson to learn in high school, college,  or a job when he fails a project for thinking he\u2019s too good to follow the directions.", "NTA. \n\nKudos to you for being calm.", "ESH. Other than the final grade - which kinda feels like some details are missing - Mr Brown gave clear, simple, and harmless instructions. Recreate a specific drawing for one, and practice using ink for another. For some reason, you think your son doesn't need to follow instructions. The detention and the final grade are weird, but it seems like you encouraged your son to be petty and defiant.", "NTA. I'm surprised you didn't step in sooner though.", "NTA. There really are some crazy teachers out there who are childlike. It\u2019s like being a teacher never allowed them to mature out of school and think like a student. Most likely the principal will support the teacher, but it\u2019s ok for them to think you are crazy as you are not their student and hopefully the teacher will think twice if he thinks you may be crazy towards him.", "NTA. You need to push harder. Go to the principle and then the school board if need be. Mr. Brown needs to be fired.", "NTA. It sounds like the teacher is the bully and you're just trying to get fair treatment for your son", "NTA - sounds like the teacher is the bully", "The \"what should I give you\" part is weird/ stupid, but so is you saying your kid deserved a good grade for not doing assignments as directed. \n\nESH.  They're not going to fire a teacher for grading according to the clear written instructions", "ESH.  The first two points were your kid not following directions.  The swearing thing was over zealous from the teacher.   The asking kids what they think they should be graded is weird.", "ESA \n\nToo many parents think they know better than teachers, think their kids are better deserving and don\u2019t realise how hard the job is. It\u2019s petty that you told the principal to fire the teacher for a new one \u2026 as if that\u2019s going to solve any issues? You\u2019re wanting someone to lose their job, because of a comment you made and you don\u2019t like the teachers methods? The proper way should\u2019ve been that you all have a sit down with the principal to discuss this teachers methods etc. \n\nThe teacher on the other hand was being to harsh with his marking, even though he did set specific and simple instructions. And then just nitpicking on the kid in general \u2026  it\u2019s not something that they should lose their job over. Like I said before, a simple sit down with the principal to discuss this would be sufficient.\n\nAlso reading the story again, if OP saying that if this kid is \u201c well behaved\u201d normally, then there\u2019s something definitely missing from the story. From experience (with a parent being a teacher), kids can and do twist stories they tell their parents about how they are at school \u2026 maybe the kid is twisting the story a bit to make the teacher look bad? Who knows at this point.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your son has problems with reading and following instructions, and is developing an attitude in that class.  And you are encouraging his attitude instead of helping him learn to follow the directions on the page.\n\nHe uses a pencil instead of a pen?  Yeah, he\u2019s going to get points taken off.  He draws advanced figures, but ones that don\u2019t follow the guidelines?  Yep, again, he will lose points.  It\u2019s better he learns *now*, while he is still young, how to read, understand, and follow the directions of an assignment, than to be encouraged by you to develop an attitude about it and push back.", "YTA\n\nOK, I'm in a unique position to see what's really going on here.  Many years ago, I was that 7th grade student in all the AP classes.  First, you need to understand that there's no such thing as an AP class.  Let me explain that.  Let's say there's an English class based on a typical 8th grade curriculum.  It's offered as 8th grade English, and it's required for all 8th grade students.  But then the exact same curriculum is offered to 7th grade students, only it's called AP.  So if you are on the AP track, you study 8th grade English (required) in 7th grade.  But they don't call it 8th grade English.  They call it 7th grade AP English.  Which students get a better education?  Normal students, or AP?  Neither.  Assuming they both graduate, they got the same classes.  If you are on the AP track, you might be able to graduate early, or take fewer classes your senior year.  But you got the same education everybody else did!!!  If I'd have figured this out sooner, I'd have been able to graduate my  Junior year.\n\nNow, your grade in any particular class is based not just on effort and test result...but also momentum.  It sounds like your son got off to a bad start with Mr. Brown, and never recovered from that.  A failure to follow instructions probably should have received an F, but Mr. Brown was in a generous mood...so gave your son a C- on one of his earliest assignments.  That set momentum in motion.  Now Mr. Brown has your kid pegged as a problem student.  Later, your son AGAIN fails to follow instructions.  Another C- grade results.  At this point, Mr. Brown is probably wishing he'd never met your kid, as he's having a hella rough time figuring out what to do with him.  He's obviously putting in effort, but failing to follow instructions.  I can't imagine a more frustrating scenario...for a TEACHER.  \n\nThe same teacher catches your kid swearing.  OK, that was bad luck.  But your kids' response to it?  Just digging himself a deeper hole.  I mean, he literally learned nothing?  Talk about a smart-ass.  My kid wrote something like that in detention?  Detention would be the least of his problems...\n\nMr. Brown gave your kid a D in class.  I know you are disappointed.  But from the POV of the teacher, I think your kid got the grade he earned.  Considering how he started out in that class, it would have been difficult to get anything higher than a C.  But from the way you tell this story, your kid really wasn't putting in the effort to improve his grade, and was constantly trying to sabotage his grade, actually.\n\nNot every good student is going to be good in every class.  Mr. Brown didn't know anything about your kid, outside of Mr. Brown's class.  In Mr. Brown's class, your kid performed as a D student, and was graded accordingly.\n\nThe problem is you are acting all entitled in the sense that you think you're opinion of your son's academic potential should mean more to his teacher than your son's actual performance in that teacher's classroom.  And if a teacher dares to give your son a well-deserved grade that is a low one...you think the teacher should be fired for that?????\n\nYou write:  \"We discussed everything above. Mr. Brown recommended my son move into the non-advanced class. \"  YES!!!  Mr. Brown is trying to look out for your kid, to help him advance in school. That's in spite of the fact that the kid's mom is being a real PITA.  My hat's off to Mr. Brown for acting so professional, under extraordinarily stressful circumstances.  I read a comment from a teacher once that went something like....\"The kids are awesome...but I can't deal with the parents\"  Exactly...\n\nGet over yourself, lady.

This is insane, capricious, and totally subjective. I was an educator for 15 years before I got too sick & this is among the most unhinged teacher behavior I have ever heard. Literally refusing to give a student his earned grades because the student was intimidated. This is an adult that gets off on bullying kids, and if your school doesn't remove him you should seek legal advice about your recourse. It might not hurt to send the school a notice to preserve all documents just to scare them into firing him to avoid the suit.", "Terrible teacher so NTA. Everything teachers learn would go directly against his behaviors. He\u2019s cutting your son down instead of building him up. He\u2019s focusing on his flaws instead of encouraging his strengths.

This is a teachable moment for your son. If someone asks you what grade you think that you deserve (and that was the real question) then you always give yourself an A.

I suspect the same is true of Mr. Brown regarding your son. \n\nIronically, hers was a visual \"art\" class, though one graded on something closer to photographic reproduction than artistic quality.

One was to ensure students could follow directions, and the other was because the teacher does not like when students draw stick figures because it indicates \"laziness.\" So, he used that assignment to teach the students another way to draw people other than stick figures (it's pretty much a stick figure with hair, clothes, and a square body/limbs). They had this assignment sheet that told them to draw Mr. Handy in different positions (jumping, running, waving). My son drew an anatomical person in those positions, with the Mr. Handy details (same face/hair/bow-tie). So, I get how he failed to follow directions, but I also understand why my son thought his interpretation still met the brief.

Never heard a word back from her and she gave my daughter a wide berth after that.", "True story\nJust before Christmas I sadly hat to terminate an employee fresh out of uni. He'd graduated with HD average, honours and had been with our firm about 6 months. Extremely, bright young man who was social and generally just likeable. So I'm sure you are asking why was he fired.... He did not follow instructions. Example request: a cover email to accompany the contracts to the client, just basic summary of the content. He produced an essay long highly detailed, colour coordinate email that look a good ten minutes to read. The example he had been given was 6 dot points. Example request: contact xyz and ask for their requirements. He contacted xyz plus a half dozen other ppl to make sure he had covered all bases. This happened all the time.\n\nDo you realise what this man and your son have in common? They didn't follow the instructions. What they produced might be very good in general but we aren't measuring in general we are measuring against the scope you were provided. After 6 months of warnings we let the guy go. It was a sad day. \n\nYour son is this guy only at the highschool level. In both examples you provided your son did not complete the task as assigned. In highschool most teachers won't really care and will just mark you on the quality of the work you produced, regardless of how well it met the criteria. However, ever now and then you will get someone who says I don't care if you painted the Mona Lisa, the Mona Lisa is not what was requested you were requested to do xyz and you only did xy. \n\nWhen your son got a C for his drawing that you admit didn't adhere to the instructions why didn't you explain to him why he lost the marks, your a smart person, you know he lost marks for not following instructions. When he got another C because he did the same thing again and didn't follow the primary instruction to use black ink why didn't you talk with him about following instructions then. You know that if you are asked to use ink and instead you use pencil you risk losing all the marks assigned to that area, why didn't you tell him that.... Instead you validated his feelings that he was being treated unfairly. Now I actually agree 'sucks' is not profanity, and this teacher seems a real stickler for rules, but the school has the right to determine if a word cannot be said or can't be used in certain contexts, your son writing an essay saying he learnt nothing was never going to result in anything other than another detention from any teacher. He could have written about use of language differences or even the greater prevalence of colloquial language - if he's a smart kid he knows about both - he chose to be a 'smarty pants' and got another detention. Finally, it is a pretty common grading method at the moment to ask a student what grade they think they deserve and use it as a portion of their grade. My daughter's school hold a whole student teacher day every semester for grades 7 to 10 for this exact purpose. They are required to review their work and then discuss with their teacher - apparently it makes them more accountable for their performance. I'm not sure I agree with not just letting the work stand for itself but there's a ton of literature supporting the method. My point is the method is currently well respected and certainly not insane.\n\nNow to bring this back to advice. Your son got a teacher with a different style then he prefers. It happens. You don't indicate that your son was singled out or graded differently than other students. Are you suggested the teacher be fired because he marks according to the criteria that he clearly outlines for students? Or that he get fired because he uses a well respected grading method that is peer reviewed and widely endorsed but you don't personally like?\n\nI don't think this teacher is perfect, he should have explained clearly and with reference to the marking criteria why your son got a C. However, you could have done that as well and you didn't. \n\nThere is a lesson in this story and it relates to my initial example. Learn from your mistakes so you don't make them next time. Next time your son gets asked to evaluate his work, he needs to actually do it not fob it off. He could have sold it for a higher mark by saying, \"I think the quality is very good and that I showed initiative and creativity even if I didn't follow the instructions. However as I have learned from those mistakes I think overall I deserve at B.\" In the real world - not highschool - if you produce work that does not adhere to a client/supervisor/bosses request multiple times and show no reflection or improvement eventually you get fired.", "YTA.

It was a primary reason I got good grades.  \n\nFurther, having taught a few hundred 9th graders, anger or perceived unpredictable angry reactions from parents does not lead to academic resiliency, and makes periods of transition from middle school to high school and high school to college particularly treacherous and onerous for students.

A regular assignment that I have for my students, is drawing a map. I have a regular pattern that I ask my students to adhere to. Mainly so that the work is easy to read. If I didn't have a uniform way for them to draw the maps, I would have a wild collection of chicken scratch. For my sanity, I have them follow very specific instructions.
