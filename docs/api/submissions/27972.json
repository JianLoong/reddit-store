I'm not American but my mom is coming and staying with my husband (35M) and I for two months to help cook and clean while I take care of my baby. My husband works nights and three times a week he works till noon, so I already know I'll be taking the night shift every night with the baby and he won't be able to help me in those days before the afternoon. I'm having a c-section and would like the first 3 to 4 weeks to go by without visitors so I can heal properly and take care of the newborn while my mom helps me with the house. I'm also concerned with his immune system during that time and wanted to wait for him to get at least some of his vaccines. My husband told my in-laws they can see the baby at the hospital when he's born but after that we'd go for 3 to 4 weeks without any visitors, them included. His mom's jaw dropped and they said they couldn't believe they weren't going to be allowed to see the baby during that time. Now my husband is asking me why they can't see the baby during those weeks and if I have a problem with his parents. It's true, I don't have a good relationship with his parents but ultimately I didn't want visitors since I'll still be healing from the surgery and taking care of the baby while also teaching online part-time - I'm self employed so I don't get maternity leave.  I know they're also upset that my mother will be here for two months while they can't see the baby for 3 weeks, however, they never offered to cook, clean, nor do groceries for us. They keep saying the want \"to see the baby\". My MIL even went as far as to say we can bring the baby to her house whenever we wish. When my husband pointed out we won't be driving a newborn anywhere (they live 30 minutes away) she said she was reluctant to come by because my husband doesn't like it when she drops by unannounced.

A C-Section takes 6 weeks to recover, as it is surgery and you aren't allowed to lift anything but the baby.  As it will be the middle of cold, flu, COVID, and RSV season.  In the states, they offer flu shots, boosters for TDAP, and MMR basically whooping cough and measles.  Your guests should be current with shots, they should come after you have healed not over the baby's first Christmas or New Year forcing you to entertain.  As for your husband's family, they can want to see the baby all they want, they wait till after 6 plus weeks and schedule the visits staggered out not all at once.  No kissing the baby as anyone with a cold sore can pass the virus to your child.", "NTA. Surgery is a major event. Your mom is there for a very practical and needed purpose, to take care of you.  In-laws are being rude. It's about competing with your mom for baby-time. Otherwise they would have a plan to be useful.  \n\nTake your time healing. Three weeks might not be enough.  \n\nForget the \"it's not fair\" whining. Take care of your health and your baby. \n\nCongratulations!", "NTA\n\nI did this with my third child and since hugely regretted not doing it with the first two. The first 6 weeks was just me and my daughter healing and bonding and establishing feeding. It was perfect.\n\nWhen my eldest was born I had a brutal emergency section and had 15 staples across my stomach. My mum turns up to the house, takes the baby off me and sends me into the kitchen to make tea. I could barely walk and was in excruciating pain. My boobs were full and leaking as my milk had just come in and he needed a feed so was restless. I'm still cross now and he's just turned 17 \ud83d\ude02", "Nope. This is not a new thing. Thirty-five years ago I made the same rule for my in-laws. Husband had 4 older sisters. One week after I was resting at home with my c-section and newborn, there\u2019s a terrible banging at my front door. It\u2019s one my SIL\u2019s. She obviously wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. Lol. I\u2019ve known her for many years now and she became an advocate for me to her family. In fact, two of the others also are dear friends now. I know all of this is painful, you have every right to make your own decisions. It\u2019s not so much a boundary as it\u2019s asking for a little respect while you heal. Btw took about six weeks to be up and moving after my first c-section. Good luck", "In El Salvador and probably most Hispanic countries\u2014 babies and moms didn\u2019t go out the first 40 days\u2014 not even doctors appointments (I had mine in the 80s) \u2014 la cuarentena\u2014", "NTA I had the same rule for my kids too. One of my kids caught whooping cough at 4 weeks when I loosened the rules - she was very ill and hospitalized for a week, on home oxygen for 3 months. I should have stuck to my guns but everyone pressured me for being such a worrywart.", "My granddaughter was born in November last year. I didn\u2019t get to see much of her the first few weeks ( I believe it was once that first month). She had the cord wrapped around her chest and, even though she was okay after, her breathing wasn\u2019t very good so she went onto the NICU for two days. I didn\u2019t even hold her because I had a shoulder injury. Was I bummed out because I didn\u2019t get to see her very much at all the first part of her life? Yes\u2026but I would have felt even worse had she gotten sick. My husband and I did get the TDAP and flu shot. I just heard that they now have a shot for RSV. The MIL needs to hold her horses and wait until mother is ready. I hope everything goes well! NTA.", "Your husband doesn't like it when she drops by unannounced.  Can't imagone why....\n\nI don't like when people show up unannounced either.  Is it too hard to pick up a phone, call and ask if it's a good time to come over?", "NTA. Whether it\u2019s fair or not, the parents of the woman who gave birth might get the preference at this stage. You\u2019re the one who gave birth; you\u2019re allowed to want your mom around.", "NTA. I did 40 days at home without visitors and it was great. I got to settle into motherhood and didn\u2019t have to host anyone. It was a lovely and a precious way to bond with my child who was inside me for 42 weeks. It\u2019s almost like you turn your home into the womb and it\u2019s a gentle way for a baby to get used to being outside of you and in the world. \n\nThen the baby can meet everyone and bond with them.", "NTA. You need to recover and baby needs as little exposure to the outside world as possible.\n\nTo the folks saying \" bUt HuSbAnD gOeS tO wErK\"\n\nIts easier to have one person manage to wear a mask, wash hands, change out clothes away from baby, do their best to not bring anything home, than 4 or 10 people. Especially some that clearly dont consider limiting contact for NEWBORNS that have 0 immunization  anything important. Sometimes it cant be helped, but sometimes it can. And you need to do your best for your own children", "My rule was no visitors until 8 weeks. Helpers could come, but not people\nwho just wanna talk at my baby and expect me to be any degree of put together and ready to entertain. \n\nMy parents stayed when my second was born, and came to help often in the earliest weeks. My FIL came to take big brother out of the house and barely paused to say hello to me & baby, which was lovely! Everyone who didn\u2019t offer to\nhelp got the party line that it wasn\u2019t worth the risk to baby, and I mentally parenthetically added it\u2019s not worth it to ME if you being here is a net stressor. \n\nOnce 8 weeks came and people\nexpected to come over for a weekend stay I was like damn shld have made it later.", "NTA. It's your baby, your recovery. They should respect that. Period!  Good luck OP.", "NTA\nIn Indian culture, nobody is allowed to visit for 40 days after birth irrespective of c section or normal delivery. The mother is not going to work for 40 days. Only the immediate family who is helping with the child can come and stay. Beyond that, nobody.\nThe reason is scientific, the mother needs to rest, the baby needs to adjust. It limits the germ exposure. The parents get the chance to set a routine. \n\nWanting limited outsiders during your recovery is perfectly fine!\nIf your in laws are really so upset, they can come up with ways they can help you rest and recover and then you should consider having them over.\nHowever, if they are only wanting to come over because your mother is there and they feel competitive, put your foot down!", "Given it takes 6 weeks to heal, I would tell everyone 8 weeks. That way if you are up to it at 6 weeks it is a happy surprise. Until then they can video call your  husband and see the baby that way. \n\nWhen did immediate visitation become a thing? I thought you dropped off flowers and a cooked meal, then left the new family alone? Maybe I\u2019m just getting old because I\u2019m 44 but when did this become a thing?! ? !   The mom has just gone through a painful serious possibly life threatening medical procedure and the new parents need to learn the adorable insomniac baby\u2019s  schedule/criers/wants/how he prefers to be held. \n\nIf anyone is pushing for more tell them to back off or stay away until  his first birthday.", "I think OP, being the one going through the most challenging physical circumstances here, should be entitled to some deference.  3-4 weeks seems totally reasonable.  \n\nSome visitors are helpful, some are\u2026 not.  My brother and sister in law have an 8-month old.  SIL is getting very little sleep due to nighttime wakeups and breastfeeding, and she works FT as a doctor on top of that.  My bro is normally pretty helpful, but he doesn\u2019t have boobs, so the bulk of the nighttime stuff still falls on SIL.  \n\nMy dad came out to visit them.  He sat down dorking around on his phone half the day, and unfortunately my bro played copycat instead of helping like normal.  SIL got a little cranky having to constantly ask my bro for help with regular things, because she was frustrated that he was leaving her to do all the breastfeeding and cleaning the house and cooking and entertaining while both my dad and bro just sat there.  After the visit, my dad had the balls to EMAIL SIL\u2019s PARENTS (she\u2019s in her 30s, ffs)  to tell them how he couldn\u2019t believe she was so snippy and he hopes she\u2019ll act better in the future.  \n\nNobody is perfect, but my SIL is not a whiner or a drama queen or anything you might be wondering.  She\u2019s a badass, and when I went to visit the following week she was perfectly lovely, despite being sleep deprived, getting her first period in 17 months, having an eye infection, and having to pump every few hours, even while we were out at a flea market.  She\u2019s a trooper.  \n\nIf you get a visitor who really helps, great.  If you get a visitor who is a burden, not great.  I dunno about you guys, but I think OP deserves some deference to her judgment of who will help and who won\u2019t.  If I were the husband\u2019s parents, I would put less effort into being offended and more effort into figuring out how I could be helpful when the 3-4 weeks were up.", "NTA I honestly think it's crazy that you're allowing them to come to the hospital. We didn't have any guests except our midwife for follow up appointments until 4 weeks. Everyone was great about it.", "NTA and I suggest you sit your husband down and have him read [The Lemon Clot Essay](https://community.babycenter.com/post/a29842181/the_lemon_clot_essay-_if_you_are_planning_to_have_people_over_after_birth_you_need_to_read_this) so he understands why you don\u2019t want visitors while you\u2019re healing from birth. This essay paints an extremely detailed picture of what you\u2019ll be experiencing post-birth, and highlights why you won\u2019t want anyone around during that vulnerable time.", "Idk. I have had two c-sections and while it is major surgery and you absolutely need to take it easy, I was able to care for myself and baby and do most things within 12 hours of surgery. Just more slowly than normal. I can see why husband and his parents would be hurt about your in-laws not being able to see the baby when your mom gets to. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for wanting to have privacy during recovery, bonding, and newly adjusting to motherhood, but would consider compromising with allowing them for a short visit on occasion, while making it abundantly clear that it is only to be a short visit for all the reasons you stated. If you\u2019re breastfeeding that can be a great excuse to cut a visit short. \u201cSorry you can\u2019t stay longer but I have to go feed the baby\u201d.", "NTA ignore everyone else, you\u2019re dealing with a new baby and surgery. You should only have the ppl you trust and are comfortable with, which is your mom understandably so.", "NTA", "In some countries it\u2019s mandatory. When I had my babies I was literally locked for 4 weeks assisted by close family. In my tradition it\u2019s costum people visit new born and mother after a month .

There is a BIG difference.\n\nIf I could have had a week or two of peace to sleep and recover\u2026 it would have been nice.\n\nNewborns sleep a lot in the first few weeks (basically when they aren\u2019t eating). So company kind makes it hard for you to sleep during that time as well.\n\nThat time, the newborn snuggles, and some peace to recover is so precious and important for reducing PPD risks.", "NTA. Healing from a c-section sucks... I know from personal experience. You aren't supposed to do much when it comes to housework because of it. It's great your mom is coming to help you. It might be different if your inlaws were offering to shop, bring food or cook, or help your mom with things around the house. They aren't... they can wait. I'm glad your husband is backing you, but tell him the truth. It's major surgery. It would be different if they were offering help. They aren't. They just want baby time. You shouldn't have to entertain them while recovering.", "Nta, especially with all of these sicknesses around d I would not let anyone near my baby. Not even my parents.

You do not visit a new mother to \u201csee the baby\u201d \nYou only visit a new mother to take care of the mother. \nThey have no intentions of doing that. Husband has to support you, not them.

You are putting him in a very awkward position.", "nta. you're allowed to rest without feeling like a monkey at the zoo", "NTA - but realize you are asking a forum of mostly teenagers. Expect a few downvotes from people who don't know what birth, much less a c-section, is like.", "While I agree that it's your choice to have whomever you want over (or not have over), I think this has nothing to do with the cold and flu season.

See if she agrees.", "I know someone who restricted her in-laws from seeing their baby for several weeks after the birth.

But it is very generous of your husband to have agreed to having the MIL stay in your home for 4 weeks ( I can\u2019t imagine that he actively wants that time with her..) \n\nYou will not be physically or emotionally able to \u201chost\u201d visitors - even his parents. Who to your understanding are not offering supports so much as wanting access. What would need to happen for them to come in that first four weeks that would make it ok? Would your husband taking responsibility for planned visits/ hosting whilst he is home make it any better?

Yours seem totally reasonable to me.", "I think NTA but you\u2019re going to destroy your relationship with your in laws specially if your mum is going to come and stay.

Good luck", "After reading the comments I am more than thankful that I gave birth during COVID \ud83d\ude05. Congrats op, take all the time you need. I personally think 3 weeks are to short.

That\u2019s why she\u2019s not getting in the house until she\u2019s invited, and that won\u2019t be for 3-4 weeks. At a minimum. Tell your husband to stop worrying about mummy dearest\u2019s feelings and get back to worrying about baby and you. He can tell his mom that every time she complains, you guys add another week before she meets the baby. It\u2019s a penalty for making things harder on the new parents. Anyone who does it gets the penalty. \n\nBtw, your mom is here to take care of you. She\u2019s not here to sit on the couch, hog the baby, take pictures for Facebook and expect to be waited on like a guest. That\u2019s why she gets to come. Have him tell that to mil!", "First, NTA. \n\nHowever, that being said, a full 4 weeks of not allowing the in-laws *any* visits is harsh. From the outside, they just see that your mother gets 24/7 access. We all know your mom is *helping*, and that in-laws probably won\u2019t, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact you\u2019re starting this new family dynamic off kinda contentiously. \n\nSince you\u2019re mom *is* there 24/7 and is helping, and it\u2019s your husband\u2019s family, why *can\u2019t* the in-laws come over for an hour a week or so, with the proviso your husband has to host?  You do nada. Oversee the visit with your feet up, or take a nap. \n\nIf you allow limited visits but say it\u2019s because it\u2019s so obvious how in-laws already love baby & want to bond so you were \u201cwilling to compromise\u201d, it would be seen as magnanimous while still keeping tight control so it doesn\u2019t turn into in-laws camping in your living room or building resentment and complaining to your husband. \n\nAgain, totally your call. Your the one going through the life changing and even life threatening event and you & DH are the parents, but this first month or two may set the tone for the in-laws relationship with you/your child going forward. Is that enough to make a small concession for?", "NTA couldn\u2019t see a friends baby for the first 2 months. She\u2019s my favorite baby to babysit. It\u2019s all about forming the relationship afterwards. Don\u2019t keep that boundary if you want people in your life. My friend almost died during birth. So only her mom, husband and kids saw the baby. After that and she was partially recovered did we see her more.", "NTA....\n\nBut I will say this is extreme. If these are afternoon visits that can be arranged around your needs, it seems an awfully long time for grandparents not to see their new grandchild. Health measures should be taken into consideration which are mitigated through hand washing, vaccination, and mask wearing.  When your child makes you a grandparent, how long will you expect to wait to see the new loved joy of the family?", "nta time to heal", "NTA. You do what is necessary to protect your baby\u2019s health AND your recovery. People who cannot respect that can wait an extra week to see baby.", "NTA.. your baby. Your call.

Early postpartum is a willllddd ride. The hormones are crazy, you might be trying to establish breastfeeding, you are healing, you are bleeding, you are probably wearing a diaper\u2014and you are doing all of this while also trying to get to know a teeny fragile human that wakes you up multiple times per night. You do NOT owe it to *anyone* to \u201cget to see the baby\u201d while you are in the midst of this incredibly tender, fragile, intimate time.\nThis whole thing of forcing visitation on mothers by guilting them or threatening them (\u201cwell then don\u2019t expect your in-laws to be there for you later!\u201d) makes me angry like nothing else. Mothers deserve better, and let\u2019s start with respecting their boundaries for postpartum healing. \nI just hope that you can ignore anyone that says you owe anyone access to your baby or your space until you are fully, completely ready to give that. People that care about you will understand that and will be willing to set their own desires aside to be there for you in whichever way *you* deem best.", "Mild YTA here.  Can you really not see how your inlaws (and husband) see it as hurtful and unfair that your mom gets to be with a baby for a whole month before they get a chance to see it?  What would be the harm of letting them come by for a few LIMITED time visits with the baby while you're resting or teaching online?", "This is sad. I feel sorry for the grandparents and the husband who will be put in the middle. What better opportunity for you to rest as having grandparents coming to visit for a little bit and watch over your new little blessing. And if one side is allowed the other should be too. This is a recipe for hurt feelings and resentment down the road. Not wanting everyone you know coming to visit for a while is one thing. Only allowing one grandparent and not the other is hurtful.\nI won't say YTA, but I definitely think it's going to cause unnecessary hurt.", "NTA\n\nBe careful about setting a particular time frame. If you are not feeling up to visitor at the 4 week mark the in-laws might still think they waited the stated time and it is their time to visit.\n\nBe flexible, if you can and feel up to it. But be abundantly clear about expectations for visits. You may be ready for a visit of an hour long before being ready to play host for a weekend visit.", "I don\u2019t understand why your husband doesn\u2019t get a say, he didn\u2019t give birth to the baby but it\u2019s his child too. It\u2019s totally understandable if you don\u2019t want to interact with visitors while you\u2019re healing. But what is your issue with them popping in for a scheduled visit with your husband and the baby while you rest or sleep in the bedroom? And, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, don\u2019t the major vaccines start at like 2 months of age? So unless something else is going on, it seems like you just don\u2019t like your Inlaws with means YTA", "There's a big difference between helping around the house AND **taking care of you** vs visiting to see the baby. \n\nYou're mom is going to practically be on lock down with you and is probably going to be super exhausted tag teaming this with you. She's not there to visit, she's there to work and be a nurse to you. Your husband needs to translate this bluntly to your in-laws. \n\nAlso, in the middle of winter is when people get sick. Your husband needs to ask his parents if their satisfaction is worth getting their newborn grandchild horribly perhaps even fatally sick. Just send them a video of a newborn with whooping cough. It's fucking heart breaking and damn scary.", "I think I need INFO. Four weeks is a lot of time, and it sounds unfair that maternal grandma gets to see the baby while the paternal grandparents don\u2019t. I know maternal grandma is only there to clean and cook, so maybe paternal grandparents can help with the baby while you\u2019re working (since you don\u2019t have maternity leave) or catching up on sleep. I know you mention that they haven\u2019t offered help, but have you or your husband asked them for help? You also need to consider your husband\u2019s feelings since this is his baby too and he should be allowed to have his parents see his baby provided that he\u2019s not pressuring you to do any hosting duties. What exactly is not good about your relationship with his parents?", "That is kind of an asshole thing to do.  They can see the baby AT the hospital, but then not again until 4 weeks later.  But your own mother is going to be there for 2 months? I get not wanting to unnecessarily expose the child to outside germs, but is your mother going to stay inside your house exclusively for the entire 2 months?  And what about your husband? Is he going to do a sanitizer - dip before seeing his own baby?\nI learned my lesson when my kids were born. \nCHILD #1: emergency C-section. My parents came right away (6+ hours away from NY). Mom planned on staying 2 weeks. Mom cleaned the house and stocked the freezers. MIL came day 9.  Mom decided to leave early.'No sense in both being here' was Mom's attitude.  Mom left day 10.  MIL left day 12 and took the food from the freezer. They were going to visit some other family members and didn't want to go empty-handed.  MIL's attitude being, 'there really isn't anything for me to do here' \nCHILD #2:  I thought I had planned better.  By this time, Child #1 was 2 and a half.  I had been dxed with MS the year before. My plan was for my mom to come for the birth. And MIL would come 2 weeks later.  A nice spread, so to speak.  My kid was born 9/11.  Mom and dad came as soon as they could. They couldn't stay long as Mom worked in Healthcare and couldn't take time off. MIL showed up the 23.  Knowing that I was going to have an extra set of hands, I made appointments with a neurologist for my MS, as well as other appointments that needed to be done. I figured that MIL could handle the kids.  I mean, one was a newborn and just slept. The other one, just leave a few toys out, they're good. MIL decided that I should take the baby with me.  Then my 2 y/o wanted to come too.  MIL's way of helping? She told my kid to go get his shoes. Never thought of telling him to stay with her.  Never offered to come with us to help out with the kids at the doctor's office. Nope.  But, she did remind me when I got home that I still needed to make dinner for my husband and guests.\n*If I had known that her and her companion were going to act like, and demand to be treated as guests in my home after I had just given birth, I probably would have been more reluctant to have them there.*", "Here's the thing, the baby isn't just yours. And you're going to have help. If your husband wants to host his parents, mind them and they baby, that's not solely your decision to make.", "Recommend you get a doorbell cam to see who is at the door. Pretend to not be home if she comes by. Tell her you\u2019re at the drs. \n\nTell them you will send photos and videos. \n\nNTA.", "I think you are totally wrong. Yes, you are the mother but your husband is the father and that baby is also his parents grandchild. They don\u2019t need to camp out but you certainly should allow them some visiting time with their new grandchild. Set boundaries. Figure out if an hour after bath in the morning is good or an hour in the early evening but you cannot allow your mom and not his. I had two babies by c-section and the healing wasn\u2019t horrible at all. Three days for the worst part? Furthermore, you aren\u2019t required to entertain them. They aren\u2019t there to see you. It\u2019s obvious that you don\u2019t have a close relationship so I\u2019m pretty sure withholding those precious first weeks of their grandchild isn\u2019t going to improve that. You are also going to cause huge resentment from your husband. Suck it up and stop being an asshole", "YTA. Its quite cruel to exclude your husbands family imo. Especially when your mum will be there continuously and not miss any of the first two months. \nI\u2019ve had 3 c-sections and yes, the recovery can be rough but guess what\u2019s helpful in that time? Help. I\u2019m sure if they said they were coming to visit and you said would you mind grabbing some groceries on the way, they would. Your relationship with them will be very strained in the future and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your husband is upset by that, and he will be justified, they are HIS family. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, random people or people with germs should not be around a newborn, but not allowing them to meet their grandchild is spiteful.", "Nta at all. My rule was 6 weeks", "YtA..Your Mom isn't the only grandparent, just as you are not the only Parent.

It definitely seems like whatever issues you have with your inlaws is playing a role in this decision. Why do you think you'd have to entertain them or they'd somehow be a burden?

I'm not American but my mom is coming and staying with my husband (35M) and I for two months to help cook and clean while I take care of my baby. My husband works nights and three times a week he works till noon, so I already know I'll be taking the night shift every night with the baby and he won't be able to help me in those days before the afternoon. I'm having a c-section and would like the first 3 to 4 weeks to go by without visitors so I can heal properly and take care of the newborn while my mom helps me with the house. My husband told my in-laws they can see the baby at the hospital when he's born but after that we'd go for 3 to 4 weeks without any visitors, them included. His mom's jaw dropped and they said they couldn't believe they weren't going to be allowed to see the baby during that time. Now my husband is asking me why they can't see the baby during those weeks and if I have a problem with his parents. It's true, I don't have a good relationship with his parents but ultimately I didn't want visitors since I'll still be healing from the surgery and taking care of the baby while also teaching online part-time - I'm self employed so I don't get maternity leave.  I know they're also upset that my mother will be here for two months while they can't see the baby for 3 weeks, however, they never offered to cook, clean, nor do groceries for us. They keep saying the want \"to see the baby\". My MIL even went as far as to say we can bring the baby to her house whenever we wish. When my husband pointed out we won't be driving a newborn anywhere (they live 30 minutes away) she said she was reluctant to come by because my husband doesn't like it when she drops by unannounced.

Anyone who just wants to turn up to coo and act clucky instead of helping with laundry or shopping is a nuisance. It's no wonder these extended isolation periods have become a thing when people seem to have forgotten that the point of the post-birth 'village' is to help, not *help yourself*. \n\nI would absolutely not put my newborn in the car for 30 minutes unnecessarily, either. That's a long trip for a baby. A month or so will go fast and by then baby will actually be more ready to meet and bond with family.", "NTA ok let me tell you about my nephew. He is my younger sisters baby. Her future mil was helping to look after baby and he came down with a cold at 13 days old. Needed to be hospitalised. The grandmother had given it to him. He picked up covid randomly at 2 months old, neither parent got sick so they have no idea how that happened. Was hospitalised when he got covid. Got RSV a few months later (grammy gave him that one too) and was hospitalised again. This kid has minimal people coming and going(2 parents, 2 grand parents), my sister works from home and has been hospitalised 3 times in the 9 months he has been alive. He has all his shots and he is keeping up with his milestones. Kids get sick, you are not going to recover quickly from a c section and be able to look after him yourself. you have your mum for that.

If she\u2019s questioning why she can\u2019t visit, she has no idea what it\u2019s like.

Maybe remind her that it\u2019s not that long, and that she\u2019s got a whole life ahead of her being the local grandma while your mom may not get that much time.    Remind them that your mom is not going to be baby hogging, but cooking, cleaning, helping you with your recovery.

And since some relatives can't seem to listen to the don't kiss the baby rule ( as seen on this sub many times) larger rules like this are often very necessary for the wellbeing of the baby. \n\nSo while all of the extended family feels entitled to get their hands on the new baby, what they're being exposed to ( likely for the first time ever) is something called boundaries.

But I also don\u2019t know how realistic you\u2019re being? \n\nI know everyone is different so I\u2019m merely sharing my story and the reasons behind. \n\nI had a c-section. While it does take 6 weeks to fully heal you are in NO WAY fully incapacitated for six weeks. You\u2019ll actually be up and moving around the next day. In fact the more you move and do, the faster you\u2019ll heal. \n\nSaying you won\u2019t be driving with a newborn is unrealistic. You\u2019ll be driving the newborn to a doctors visit two days after bringing them home from the hospital (not to mention, driving them home from the hospital), and then again a week later, and then two weeks later, and then again at a month, etc. You actually drive a lot. Although yes, your MIL suggesting you drive thirty minutes with a newborn is absurd. \n\nWe took baby on as many walks as we could. It was healthy for both me and baby.  Yea. I\u2019m aware it will be cold. I gave birth in Feb in a midwestern state. I bundled the sh** out of my kid, put her in a special wool lined cocoon thing and as long as it wasn\u2019t unbearably cold (like in the low teens or below) we went for a walk. Because babies need to be exposed to the sun early to help set their circadian rhythm. And as someone healing from a c-section your body actually needs the movement to help it heal properly. \n\nNew Motherhood can be VERY isolating and lonely. VERY. no matter how helpful your husband is he\u2019ll never fully get it. Isolating yourself from people even more than necessary may hurt more than help. I get that your in laws want to meet the baby. I also don\u2019t know your relationship with them. And tbh I wasn\u2019t excited about mine coming to visit either. I don\u2019t like my FIL. But my MIL and SIL turned out to be some of the most helpful visitors! Totally shocked me. FIL was exhausting hahaha. \n\nMy 7mo is now a healthy, incredibly well adjusted and happy little girl. She LOVES meeting new people and doesn\u2019t show signs of \u201cmommy only\u201d so far. I\u2019m also able to bring her anywhere and if it\u2019s nap time she snuggles down where she is and puts herself down to sleep. I know a HUGE part is how lucky I am that she\u2019s just a chill AF baby (don\u2019t worry. She had me up at 4:30 this morning. She ain\u2019t perfect) but the other part was really welcoming in my village and bringing her out into the world as soon as I could. \n\nI did it safely as well. Visitors were required to have their t-dap, Covid, and flu shots. Adults 60+ can also get an rsv shot now. Everyone must wash hands before touching baby.

Seeing my son parent his newborn was one of the most treasured memories I have.\nBabies grow and change rapidly. The newborn is one of the most precious times. \n\nMy DIL also had a C section with both children. When she gave birth the second time, we watched the 2 year old and didn\u2019t go to the hospital although the maternal grandmother did. I was not jealous because I knew I would still meet my new granddaughter as a newborn.\n\nIts important to my son that I bond with his children. I can see it on his face how happy and proud he is when we are interacting.\nIf your husbands parents have had their shots, and can reasonably be expected to wash their hands and not kiss the baby and keep their visits extremely short, its selfish of you to not give your husband and his parents access to one of the most special times of family life.\nMake them bring a meal or ask them for what you need.\nIf your inlaws are difficult people in general and not respectful than I take back everything I just wrote", "So your mother lives in, but your in-laws don't even get to visit once?

If the mother can be there for two months, the MIL should have some limited opportunities to bond with her new grandchild as well. Repeat: I said limited, meaning with restrictions such as vaccinations, hand sanitizing or mask wearing visits for an hour at approved times once ever week, 10 days or whatever. Otherwise, this does seem like favoritism for her own mother. Also, maybe MIL could be the relief helper for mother when she is granted permission to visit. People nowadays don\u2019t seem to see the big picture as to fairness. That\u2019s my opinion.", "I kinda feel sorry for the dads in this situation, because maybe they would like the support of their parents too, just as the woman has the support of her own mother.

You are very lucky to have your Mom stay with you for two months.  It would be nice if you could say your Mom is coming to help you rather than \"help cook and clean\".

My parents were close by and a great help to me, but to hold my daughter or take her for a walk while I showered, cleaned or rested.  As for not allowing your in-laws to see the baby, it sounds a bit harsh.  Since I don't know the entire story behind your relationship with them it is hard to get a ruling on this.  I didn't have a wonderful relationship with my MIL, but wouldn't have dreamed of keeping her from her (only) Grandchild.  Thirty minutes is not far and babies immune system should be able to tolerate Grandma.  This may be a chance to turn your relationship with them around (and secure your future relationship with your son).  There is a high likelihood you will need and want your in-laws assistance with child care in the future.  My daughter just lost her Grandma, who I had no contact with for over 9 years due to a divorce.  It was heart wrenching for her, they had a wonderful relationship.

I would be absolutely thrilled if family was only 30 minutes away and I could drop my baby off anytime and have a nap. I can\u2019t explain how valuable that would be. Also allowing your child to develop a relationship with their grandparents that love them and are nearby and want to be active in their life is really nice. Not allowing them to visit for 2 months doesn\u2019t put everything off on the right foot.

And days husband might be asleep. Not good as op will be working.\n\nI would guess they had intended to plonk themselves on the sofa all day and hold baby while op brings them food and drinks.\n\nEdit:forgot details re shift work.", "Precautions are in place. No visits for a month.\n\nFFS babies are boring for the first month anyway. Meet it later, when it's safer. It's not like it's got a personality right outta the womb.\n\nThey have the opportunity to develop trust with OP and make her amenable to them being around the baby after the first month. If they try to boundary stomp I'd be cutting off all contact and they wouldn't get to see the kid at all.", "OP's mom doesn't live in the country \ud83d\ude44 we don't know where she lives and how expensive is to go back and forth. Not all people have the means to travel often. And, again, it is just for 4 weeks. But you have the right to have your own opinion as I have the same right. And I am on OP's side, because I do understand where she is coming from, and the reason of her request.", "Why, so when the baby needs to be fed 30 minutes later  or cries for it\u2019s mother they can drag her out to feed/comfort it? Come on bffr\n\nEasy solution would be if in-laws said \u201chey DiL, great! We will see you in a couple of weeks when you\u2019re feeling better! Can\u2019t wait :)\u201d", "I know my mother\u2019s were set on a table. I\u2019ve heard the story repeatedly.", "My mother\u2019s c-section, albeit 17 years ago, involved setting her intestines on a side table as retold by my father repeatedly as he was in the room.", "?? It doesn't matter if the in-laws are comfortable seeing OP's post-op diapers or breastfeeding sessions, **it matters that the post-op patient is uncomfortable with those things.** \n\n\nWhat kind of backwards world are you living in?", "I loved having family over to hold the baby.  Guess what happened? They held the baby and I got a break", "If grandma expects to be catered to doing the visits right after a c-section. Then yes. It's selfish. \n\nI had one, and I didn't even step out of the hospital bed for the first 2 days. Day 3 was going to the toilet myself, a short shower, then resting up as much as possible. \nThe recovery felt like it took ages. I would personally rather do 10 natural births again than just a single c-section. Everything hurt, walking, lifting, and laying certain ways.\n\nShe's not offering to come and help, but to come play with the baby. \nThe baby at that stage eats, sleeps, poops. And that's it. \nEverything would be on OP, socialising, dishing up with coffee, etc. \nWhile handling feeding, job. Etc. \nAll while trying to get into a routine with the baby. Feeding schedule, taking good care of herself, etc. \nWaiting until OP is healed up better from an operation, getting the hang of feeding, sleep (at night, taking a nap while baby does). All that. Is the least grandma could do. \nThe baby won't be traumatised from not meeting grandma for a few weeks. But OP could get stressed.", "Is it truly current advice? None of my friends or family have ever been this cloistered with their babies (aside from the ones born in 2020). To each their own but this is pretty rare i think.", "It just sounds like insane new baby fear. I get it I still remember those first days but the idea of not having the immediate family Iver to see the baby and hold it just seems really weird.", "When it\u2019s cold, flu, RSV season and you\u2019re exposing a defenseless infant to all that, you absolutely ARE being selfish. \n\nSigned,\nGrandmother to 3, one born during covid.", "Yes, considering the baby is at risk of contagious illness (and covid is still a danger), especially in winter.", "OP\u2019s husband obviously wants to host his parents/have them visit. It\u2019s just as much his right to do that as it is OP\u2019s. As someone above said, HE can host them while OP naps!", "Husband would want his parents over.", "Her Husband, the child\u2019s father is being forced the host and accommodate and live with her germ ridden mother for months while she lives there to \u201c help\u201d aka bond with the baby 24/7.. . Meanwhile he is supposed to tell his mom she isn\u2019t allowed in the door \ud83d\ude12\ud83e\udee0\nEdit: YTA", "literally - the amount of pressure put on women after having a baby - vaginal or c section delivery is absolutely insane. Let the damn woman take some time to bond with her newborn and to recover from a major surgery. JFC - so frustrating!!!!", "ffs what state do you think you'd be in for FOUR weeks? You're not supposed to have sex for 6 weeks. That doesn't mean you are an invalid.\n\nShe doesn't have to \"entertain\" anyone. Grandma and Grandpa want to see and hold the baby. They don't have to be served refreshments or entertained with conversation. OP's mother is there to help out so the house isn't going to have to be cleaned specially for them to come over.\n\nBabies need a lot of care and attention. If OP is that exhausted it will be a break for her. \n\nOP doesn't like her in-laws and wants to exclude them. She's the AH", "I think the experience varies so widely and she shouldn't pre-decide that she won't be in a state for company. I had a c-section too and I hit the ground running - although I did have a few days in the hospital alone with the baby to recover a bit. We had visitors as soon as we were out of the hospital. If I didn't feel like being there, I didn't. I went to take a much needed nap. I do understand the germ issue to a point...but if covid has taught us anything it's mask up and wash your hands! My in laws masked around my son for maybe the first 6 months of his life. Was it ideal? No. But it was better than excluding them.", "Babies are endlessly fascinating to the people who love them straight out the gate. It's not unreasonable for grandparents to want to see their grandchild in the earliest days.", "It was a long time ago but I think it was herpes.", "This isn\u2019t about the OP\u2019s mother unless the in-laws want to be there all day hogging up the baby and I\u2019m on the side of joint parenting.

My gratitude is eternal.", "It's not about being an invalid, it's about privacy. OP and her partner clearly don't have a close relationship with his parents pre-baby, so why do they think that's going to magically change post-baby?", "Honestly, based on their attitude, they would criticise the mother for being lazy and not a good host because she's too busy looking after the baby and recovering.  My sibling was recovering from a C-section and her MIL came to help. She was constantly asking my sibling to get up and find things for her or wake her up to ask questions. She asked her to  \"run downstairs\" and switch the laundry and that's when her visit ended.", "Maybe grandparents should learn that they don't always get what they want when they want it.", "Yes, if I remember well it was. A family member decided to kiss the baby and changed the lives of that baby forever.", "So I googled the student's name and the town, plus cerebral palsy and was easy to find a lot of things about her on the news (I was her teacher 11 years ago, so my memory of the da facts is not that accurate anymore). She was 8.5 months old and yes, it was herpes (HPV). However, she was kissed in her hand and took her hand to her mouth. The virus then migrated to her brain and caused severe brain damage.\n\nThe local schools, fire department, local police, and so on are always doing fundraisers to help her (she's 17 years old now) because the treatment costs 2k euros a month. It's private and elective therapy (such as hydrotherapy, acupuncture, and so on) but she also does speech therapy and physiotherapy (not elective) and in 2017 the mother was asking for donations for a machine (Innowalk) that she hoped helped her daughter to walk. \n\nUnfortunately, as someone who specialised in SEN, I don't believe she will ever speak and walk. There is no way. 11 years ago the only thing she was able to do was laugh (bless her) and move her arms up and down. For sure she could have learnt sign language in the meantime (I hope so) but I don't think she will ever be able to verbalize orally.", "My grandson had colic or reflux or something that had him screaming all night every night. I used to go over there a couple times a week and walk around the house with him for hours until he fell asleep and then hold him until one of his parents woke up. My son told his friend that was the only time they got any sleep.", "OP doesn't have a close relationship with her in-laws. I didn't see where it says her husband doesn't have one.", "What attitude? That they want to see the baby? You are reading way too much into the situation.", "I mean he doesn't like his mum dropping by without warning so he either is a rather private person or he doesn't like to deal with her too much / often / on short notice.", "Maybe the grandparents need to respect the wishes of the parents. That's my take."]}
