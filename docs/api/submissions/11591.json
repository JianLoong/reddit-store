However, he can refuse to renew the lease for any or no reason (this usually happens in month to month tenancies) - so you are NTA at all for refusing to help him out of his problem with the ARM, but he may very well refuse to renew the lease itself.", "Info- after looking around, are you paying below market rates now?

It's not your job to reduce his losses anymore than it's his to let you share in his gains.\n\nYou're probably about to find out that you don't really have a friendship: it's a business relationship.  I'm sure he figures there was no harm in asking you to pony up an extra $200/month, ballsy as it was.\n\nStay put and only pay the increase he's legally allowed to charge.", "NTA.

They likely will not give him all he is asking for, but it would be higher than 2.5%. You are under no obligation to vacate, nor accept his desired terms. And I recommend you don't do either since the rental market is actual shit right now. Staying in your place is your best bet to affordable rent.

Or, pay the higher rent, because you can't stand the thought of screwing a friend despite the fact that you can't afford the higher rent.\n\nThink is, your friend took on certain risks when he became a landlord.  One of those risks is a mortgage increase with a rent-controlled property.

Your rent is part of a business relationship, even if you also have a personal relationship with your landlord, and there is no reason you should do something so against your own interests! Rent control exists for a reason. Landlords have more power in their relationships with their tenants, that's why tenants are the ones who get extra protection. Maybe he shouldn't have gotten a variable rate mortgage for a property where he can only increase the rent 2.5%.

If you can afford it, you might want to sweeten the deal a little  - make a counter offer that he can increase it by $90 this year, not $60.

Next year is next year, and who knows where everything will be by then.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't responsible for his risk.", "NTA\n\nDo not feel bad for his mistakes.

A lot of landlords try to take advantage of people, increasing rent by more than legally allowed and pulling shady stuff. You\u2019re right, in Ontario a landlord is only legally allowed to raise rent by 2.5% per year. You do not have to sign a new lease once your current lease ends, you can continue paying on a month to month basis and they can only evict you if he plans on moving in or moving in a family member", "NTA.  He is in too much of a power position for it to be N-A-H for potentially taking no for an answer.\n\nThis guy was more than happy to ride the real estate bubble up, probably congratulating himself for his genius in watching the value estimates climb up during massive covid stimulus and low interest rates (in his mind, the explanation was probably \"they don't make any more land\" or whatever).  He did not offer to lower your rent or share the gains with you during this period.\n\nNow, of course, both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada have real inflation problems on their hands and have raised rates significantly.  The five-year mark for his rate reset was not a surprise, and rates have been rising a lot for around a year, so he has had time to do something about this.  If rising rates were going to be an issue for him to be able to make money as a landlord, he should have sold, or he could at least have given you more warning.  What's more, in the US, there is currently a yield curve inversion between the 10-year Treasury and the Federal Funds Rate, implying either a recession or even higher mortgage rates coming, neither of which is good for real estate prices.  He can still save a lot of losses by selling now.\n\nThis is not your problem to fix.", "NTA.

That way, you have a chance at salvaging the relationship/reference.", "Think this tenant is in Ontario based on what I read it sounds very much like it. Sadly what could end up happening is after the lease is up usually it goes month to month and landlord can say that they themselves are moving in or moving in a relative.", "A similar 3 bedroom house down the street is being advertised for almost $900 more per month.", "I cannot afford to meet him halfway. Maybe $100 more per month max, but I don\u2019t want to if I don\u2019t have to.", "It automatically goes month to month in Ontario after the initial term. A landlord cannot just decide not to renew a lease unless they are taking the unit over for family use.", "Im in Ontario as well. So he can apply to increase the rent above the guidelines? How does that work?", "OP is probably in Canada. 30 yr fixed is rare there; 5 yr variable is very common. And if they\u2019re in Ontario, the landlord will be moving in relatives soonest.", "It\u2019s funny that the variable rate mortgage thing is so looked down on by Americans.  From the 2.5% max increase and the auto MTM tenancy comments the OP is likely in Ontario.  Once you are out of the US you don\u2019t have access to 15 and 30yr government subsidized bond rates.  This makes the typical fixed rates only 5 year terms.  So even fixed rate has potential volatility and 30yrs don\u2019t exist and any reasonably competitive price.  \n\nThe other thing this creates is a situation where on average a variable rate mortgage is cheaper than a 5hr rate mortgage if you always use the savings to reinvest in capital pay down.\n\nOutside of early Covid and possibly right now where variable is higher than fixed.  Variable in Canada offers lower lifecycle costs than fixed provided you can afford the fluctuations.", "Commercial mortgages often don\u2019t offer anything other than variable, so the LL may not have had a choice.", "You don\u2019t always have a choice.", "It depends on the market. Yes, there's a risk, but if you look at trends you're ok. We renewed in the early teens and interest rates kept dropping. Instead of lowering our payments we opted to keep them as they were, meaning we paid off our principal really fast. We're mortgage free now... I wouldn't advise anyone to do it now (because OUCH), but give it 3 years or so, and the pendulum may swing in the other direction again.", "This is an interesting thought process.  Let\u2019s run it in reverse.  Because the LANDLORD snagged that loan, OP has had very affordable housing all this time.  Now, the LANDLORD has to pay more on the loan, but he should just, support OP?  (Edited to add: obviously, with a rent controlled unit, landlord would have to wait until the lease is up to make changes.  But somehow, LANDLORD acting on that would be morally wrong? )\n\nIf you do a job, working regularly, should you accept less than the going salary because your employer can\u2019t afford to pay what others do?

By your reasoning, insisting on being paid what you are worth would make you the problem in the economy\u2026", "For perspective, OP shared similar house on his street is charging $900 more a month in rent. I think this landlord is an honest guy renting without intention making a profit and with interest rates going crazy now cannot afford it. Really we need more landlords that are renting at cost instead of profit. OP isn\u2019t in the USA, so banking system is very different to prevent crashes like in the USA.", "Agreed, NTA.\n\nLandlords are not your friends. (in the same kinda way that HR at work aren't looking out for you, they're looking out for your employers' interests).", "My lease is month to month, and as long as I pay it\u2019s illegal for him to kick me out unless his relatives move in.", "In Ontario, once your lease is up your house automatically goes month to month, and you cant get kicked out unless you don\u2019t pay rent or the landlord gets a family member to move into the house.", "OP is in Ontario where after the first year they go month to month. However the landlord can sell the place, say they or a relative is moving in or are making it into a single family dwelling for a relative. However the landlord could drag there feet for a year on the last option and after 1 year re rent the space.", "Leases automatically go month-to-month in Ontario, and a landlord cannot end a tenancy unless they move family in for minimum 1 year.", "If he feels he can\u2019t afford it, then he might make that change and ask a member to move in or move in himself. You\u2019re NTA for not paying but it might be a good idea to start looking for back ups.", "That\u2019s not 100% true although those are some reasons. They essentially can\u2019t evict you without reason, but there are more than what you list. That being said he doesn\u2019t actually have a reason to evict you so that\u2019s in your favour. \n\nThe downside that I\u2019ve seen from the landlord and tenant tribunal in Ontario is it often works in favour of the landlord. Also if your friend ends up being a real crummy guy he can make it very easy to seem he has reason to evict you. Just go on some of the landlord pages and you\u2019ll see how awful some people can be. \n\nBut I hope your friend is a stand up guy and doesn\u2019t have an issue. My dad flipped a house in retirement and was a landlord but one who was pretty fair and ended up selling to his renter. They exist, even if it\u2019s few and far between. Good luck!", "Yup. That\u2019s what happens a lot in these situations. In fact if I\u2019m representing a landlord and I see an auto-renew in their lease I always recommend they change it to MTM unless otherwise agreed because if they have a problem tenant who hasn\u2019t given them \u201ccause\u201d for an eviction but who they want to leave, the only way to do it is on a termination of a MTM tenancy. If you like the tenant you can always renew for another term. \n\nI mostly represent tenants, though, so nobody come for me.", "Ontario might be the only place where I feel sorry for landlords.  This guy could quit paying rent for probably 2 years before he would actually be evicted.  \n\nIf the guy claims he is moving in him or a relative and doesn\u2019t for the required period of time he can be sued and usually will lose quite easily.\n\nHe should just refuse the rent increase, read through the tenancy laws and ensure he is compliant and expect the annual 2.5% increase.\n\nHe is at much bigger risk for it to be sold once interest rates stabilize or drop if the owner is cash flow negative.", "I have a friend looking right now for a rental and it\u2019s bonkers in Ontario!! I hope you can make it work out.", "I think realistically you probably should, if you want to renew your lease through him he might have to reject you to get another tenant to meet the necessary rent", "He would need to wait until his mortgage renewal, so he has exact figures and mortgage documentation to show the increase in costs. He would also include any increase in property taxes and utilities (if he pays them, not if you pay them). He would need to fill in a Landlord Tenant Board form called an L5 Application for Above Guideline Increase. Once processed, the Board would determine how high the increase would be. In the meantime, you continue to live in the unit. He may increase your rent the guideline amount (this year 2.5%). Once you know the results of the LTB, you can make a decision about your long term tenancy. And he may decide he can't carry the building and choose to sell. But that isn't your fault, and these processes are in place to provide fairness for all. The Board isn't perfect, but don't give up your affordable housing!!! He could also apply next year for an above guideline if, for instance, his property tax went WAAAAY up from a new value assessment. But the LTB puts heavy scrutiny on multiple above guideline Increases in a short period. I hope that helps!", "He takes you to the LTB and he shows them all the increase in his bills, mortgage, property taxes and potentially any other bills he covers for the unit and they will decide if he can increase it to a different percentage. I have heard it\u2019s 50-50 right now with the board but you should look at a paralegal to assist you as they are able to help out the most from what I have heard.", "Btw, if he sells, you still do not need to vacate. The new owner would need to give a reason for you to leave, such as personal use. You stay until you get an actual eviction notice from the LTB is issued and enforced. An N11, for instance, is NOT AN EVICTION. No landlord can issue an eviction. Only the Board. Which can take a year from the notice to the tenant (or longer) for the hearing and decision process. All of that time you keep living there.", "Was thinking the exact same thing. Sounds like a tenant in Ontario and there are ways for the landlord to get what they want and the tenant will be screwed over harder.", "Yep - most people in the US just assume the rest of the world has similar banking.  At one point, some places and banks were even offering 40 year loans on primary homes, with fixed rate loans and low down payments.  It is nuts.\n\nBy comparison, a lot of investment property is secured by a commercial loan, and may only lock the rate for 1, 3, or 5 years.  \nThe other issue is that the US, people have gotten super used to cheap mortgages, and have forgotten that around 7% was the norm for a long time.", "He had the choice of not taking the loan if the conditions were unfavorable.", "This is correct in Ontario.  Not sure why this is getting downvoted.", "Well, be prepared for him to get a family member to move in. Then you\u2019ll really be screwed since it seems like you can\u2019t pay market rate.", "Yeah, I just looked into Ontario\u2019s rental policies.  They make it nearly impossible for a landlord to get their property back from a tenant.  It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nI\u2019m surprised anyone rents out their properties there.  Sounds like you\u2019re still on the hook as the landlord and landowner, but you have no legal control of your property and no say in when you get your property back or when you get new tenants.", "Plus landlord can apply for an increase over the minimal amount.

Am I at risk of having my tenancy cancelled in Ontario?", "The wild thing is he could have the family member pay rent under the table and not claim a tenant at all.

If son happens to be partial owner of the house, even 1% and there's common shared spaces (eg. Kitchen and/or washroom).\n\nThen they can argue you're roommates and therefore, legally can evict you without the normal notice time.\n\nHowever if the basement unit and upper units are in no way connected like some doesn't use the space upstairs, then it follows the standard LTB process.\n\nHowever he can opt to sell his primary home and evict you (I believe N12) as \"he no longer has a place to stay\" with means to move into the upper house unit - as an example.", "Thanks for the heads up.", "Separate appartments", "No problem. It also is outside the scope of the dreaded renovictions that happen if he was to say that he was making it into a single family dwelling for his son or someone else in the family.

Our rates are typically 5 year increments (at most). There is only 1 bank lender that actually does offer a 25 year fixed rate - and it's mostly unfavorable (usually roughly 10% interest).\n\nThe other issue is Canada is super stringent on stress testing so even if the rate right now is 6.7%, your financials are tested at the rate at bank interest rate (usually prime so in this case, 6.7%) + 2% or 5.25%, whichever is higher at the time.
