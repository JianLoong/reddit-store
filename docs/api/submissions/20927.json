He passed away in an accident in April.\n\nA few weeks before the accident, I found out that he had a one night stand with a woman who he works with. When he died, I hadn't decided yet what was going to happen in our relationship. We entered counselling and were still living together but obviously it was hectic. As I wasn't sure if we were going to divorce, I decided not to tell our families and only confided in a few close friends and my therapist. I didn't want opinions from everyone. I also didn't tell his family when he died, there was no reason to.\n\nA few weeks ago the affair partner reached out to me. She's 5 months pregnant and preparing to raise the baby. She wanted me to tell his family because she wants her child to have a relationship with his family and be connected to his culture. I said I wouldn't do this and simply passed along their contact information. Shit hit the fan. I am close with his brothers and I thought that they were going to raise him from the dead and kill him again (apologies for the dark humour).\n\nThey're coming around to the idea of having a relationship with the baby but I do not want to (nor has the mother offered which is fine.)\n\nThe mother has gotten back in touch with me to ask for some of my husbands possessions. She wants his clothes, his books, his record collection, and bizarrely his wedding ring. For the baby to feel connected to it's father. I've made it very clear to her that I will be giving her nothing of the sort. His parents and brother have some of his stuff and she can access things like that through them. She kept pushing and I lost my temper and called her an outrageous bitch who should find some shame.\n\nI wouldn't be opposed to passing some of the stuff along to the child via my in-laws when they're older and can appreciate it. Not the wedding ring, which was the worst request IMO but other sentimental stuff. I've also retained a lawyer to look into whether I owe the child any money legally from my husband's passing. If I don't, I may set up a trust fund for them when they're an adult with his money because I really don't need it and that seems fair. I just do not want to give this woman all I have left of my husband. I really do not trust her with any of it.\n\nObviously she thinks I'm a bitter raging monster bitch and an asshole and my in-laws are divided. My in-laws are largely supportive but some think that I need to give some of his stuff to her and the baby. Some of his brothers have told me that they're sympathetic but that I'm behaving like an asshole and a baby by not co-operating for the sake of the child. I'm unsure whether the complicated grief is clouding my judgement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: My in-laws are getting a paternity test when the baby is born. This was the first thing they asked. However, the scans and due date line up perfectly when the affair occurred so I think it is more than likely true so we are preparing for this.", "created_utc": 1688075122, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mhim9/aita_for_not_giving_the_mother_of_my_dead/", "score": 313, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she wants to get the possessions of her partner after they die she should consider getting married instead of being the other woman. There's nothing bitter about what you're doing. She just doesn't know how life or the law works.\n\nEdit: it's not your job to have any sort of relationship with the child and I also don't get why you'd need to set up a trust fund for the baby. Seems like you're willing to do more than you need to.  Also what exactly does your husband have that a baby would even want?", "NTA. His WEDDING RING?! 5 bucks and my left toe says that\u2019s so she can spin the tail that THEY were married and he isn\u2019t an affair baby. Absolutely not, that\u2019s bonkers", "You sound incredibly reasonable to me. You\u2019re willing to put things aside for the child, including a trust! You just don\u2019t want to deal with the other woman while in the midst of grief. Definitely talk to a lawyer and shut out the noise from those who are claiming your reaction isn\u2019t okay. NTA", "NTA. Your deceased husband's sidepiece wants you to give her your husbands stuff??? Oh Hell No. You are not obligated to give her a damned thing. Nor do you have any kind of monetary obligations towards her or the baby since she was the sidepiece & not his wife. That person would be you. \n\nWhy would you even consider setting up a trust fund for a homewreckers kid? (yeah yeah, the baby is innocent, but the mom isn't) That would just give her leverage to demand more. Which she doesn't deserve.", "Nta at the point wedding ring came out of her mouth I'd have needed people to hold me back. The in laws not 100% behind whatever you choose to do 3 months after the death are TA and I would be considering going lc/nc there. \n\nShe can turn to his family for a connection and you were generous giving her that. I would be suggesting they get a paternity test as well, she could be lying for all any of you know.", "Nta, and who's to say the child was even his and she's not just trying to get free valuable stuff?", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t give her a dime. That\u2019s what she gets for screwing a married man this is on her. And before anybody says she didn\u2019t know she obviously knew.", "His wedding ring? She wants to give her child their father\u2019s wedding ring?! From his marriage to the wife he cheated on to conceive said child?!\n\nNTA. Block her.

Wow, I'm so sorry that this is happening in your time of grief.  She has no right to demand anything.  Honestly, I wouldn't do anything now without a confirmed paternity test.  Once things are confirmed and the baby is actually here, then you can decide what you want to do for the child.  But she is making outrageous demands.  Please set your boundaries and tell her all future communications should go through a neutral party, like a family member from your side or even a lawyer.", "NTA. I wonder if she wants the wedding ring and all these personal items so she can try to pass off that she was his wife to the child or something weird like that.", "NTA. She wants the stuff of value he owned. I think that says something. You are being more than reasonable and charitable to his child. She wants the child to remember. What about his wife?", "NTA. She's using the baby to guilt the family and you into having the possessions SHE wants for herself! How would a baby enjoy a record collection, books and clothes? She gave herself away when she asked for the wedding ring.\n\nThis child hasn't even been born yet and she's trying to claw what little you have left of his memory from you.\n\nThe trust fund is a great idea, and also passing along what you feel comfortable parting with via your in-laws when the child is much older.\n\nMy condolences. I hope you have time to grieve and heal.", "NTA.  Make her take a DNA test (there are grandparent DNA tests) to see if the child even belongs to your  husband.  Don't give a thing until you get the test.  Give what you need to do legally.", "Is the baby even his tho for sure?", "Absolutely NTA. The nerve of that woman to call the wife of the man she slept with once to ask for his stuff. That\u2019s truly insane! Please don\u2019t give her anything.", "NTA \n\nThe side chick has some nerve", "NTA. You don't owe her any sentimental objects. The child, however, may be entitled to a portion of the inheritance, if the mother can prove paternity. I'm sure your lawyer will advise you correctly.", "Nta, wedding ring, you can't be serious", "NTA. I\u2019m confused how any of his family could find what you have offered objectionable. Offering it through in-laws when child is older is more than reasonable.\n\nThat none of them could see the unreasonableness of the asks when she asked for the ring is a bit strange. Also- I\u2019m assuming she knew he was married when they had the affair?\n\nIt really sucks but at some point you may have to go no contact with his family- especially if this woman and child will now be in their lives. Had he lived and you divorced this more than likely would have been necessary.", "NTA\n\nIt was a one night stand. I'd ask for proof of paternity and not hand over a single thing until the pregnancy ends with arrival of a healthy child.", "NTA - You could literally block her and do nothing. So anything you do do is extra.", "NTA. I could see giving her pictures (copies are fine) or some other items but his wedding ring is too far. That crosses a line. The kid is entitled to have something of his fathers but that doesn\u2019t mean it needs to come from you.", "NTA. I think a trust fund would make this AP feel even more entitled - you're welcome to do this if you wish but personally I wouldn't let her know about it at all and just give it to the kid directly when they're old enough and if they turn out semi decent (which they may not with a mother like that), and if they turn out to really be your husband's kid. \n\nYou don't seem like a monster, it sounds like the AP is actually trying to get on your nerves to get a response out of you for some sick reason. Give whatever junk from your late husband that you don't want to his relatives, nothing more or less, and they can deal with that train wreck.", "NTA.\n\nMy husband drank himself to death, which by itself is traumatic, but when his ex-wife found out she started hounding me for stuff like his watch she gave him, and other sentimental stuff.\n\nI told her I had no idea why she wanted any of this stuff because she is the one who divorced him and told her to talk to his brother, because he had everything (somewhat true).\n\nTurns out she was his side chick the last few months before he died (I found out afterwards but by the time she was his sidechick I had mentally checked out of the relationship anyways).\n\nStill, I told her to go piss up a rope. I had a lot of his stuff including the stuff she wanted, but like I said, she left him, so as far as I'm concerned she had no right to any of it. She tried to badmouth me to his trashy friends for a while, but I never wanted anything to do with most of them while he was still alive. His family likes me and we still talk, and they don't blame me for anything, they were just surprised I didn't leave him before he died.\n\nI was about to, and then he died.", "NTA. For what it\u2019s worth, I think you\u2019ve been handling the situation well and I certainly would not have given any of this a second thought. I don\u2019t even know that I would remember my partner fondly after finding out they cheated, dead or not. But since you mentioned the family already has some of his stuff, I think it\u2019s outrageous to request things like the wedding ring. You deserve to keep things for yourself and this is part of your grieving process. Nobody has a right to take that from you or tell you how to handle this, certainly not an affair partner. if you choose to give things in the future, that\u2019s a decision you get to make at a time you\u2019re ready to do so. a baby is not gonna do anything with your husband\u2019s records for at least a few years. \n\nalso from what i gathered, the mother of the child doesn\u2019t even want you to be in the kid\u2019s life. just his family. so if the family wants the child to have things so badly, they should give from their own things and not expect somebody who\u2019s not even particularly welcomed in the child\u2019s life to do so.\n\nSetting up a trust fund for this child that\u2019s not yours sounds like an amazing thing to do, and quite above and beyond. Nothing I would expect from a \u201cmonster\u201d. Also, I do hope you know for sure the child is actually your late husband\u2019s and not speculated by from the affair partner. Warm wishes, condolences and best of luck\ud83d\udc95", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss. I would block her completely. This woman slept  with your husband knowing he was married. Though obviously your husband shared in the fault and would have had responsibility here, you have neither fault nor responsibility. If your husband's family wishes to have contact for the sake of the child, or to give the child things related to their culture, that's their right. But that has nothing whatsoever to do with you, and you needn't be involved with her at all. \n\nI realize that pregnancies  happen sometimes even when appropriate precautions are taken, but I would not take her word that your husband was the father without proof.  I agree with you that, unless your attorney advises otherwise, you owe her nothing. Even if that's the case, making sure anything you might choose to do in the future  out of kindness rather than legal obligation goes directly to the child is wise.", "NTA.", "NTA at all and don't let them pull this guilt trip on you. It was a one night stand. They didn't have a relationship and likely wouldn't have other than dealing with the child if he had lived. Tell your inlaws what you've said here about when the child is older and then tell them to stop discussing it. It's none of their business.", "Um. What. Excuse me? She... did what? And then did what? And is demanding WHAT?  Oh HELL no, what on earth is she thinking? NOPE. NOPE NOPE NOPE. That's crazy and she has no right to demand anything from the wife of the man she was sleeping with after he tragically passed away, and she has a hell of a nerve to think she's entitled to anything. \n\nNTA. OP, honey, I am so sorry you are going through this, and you are in no way in the wrong for feeling the way you do. It is beyond inappropriate for her to ask for anything beyond a couple of photographs, let alone HIS WEDDING RING?  WHAT THE HECK IS SHE THINKING?\n\nOoof, I'm all kinds of mad on your behalf now.", "NTA. This is wild.", "NTA, OP I'm so sorry you're in this horrific situation. Give yourself time to grieve, and only when you feel ready, you could consider passing some items through your in-laws as you say. The potential plan of a trust fund sounds fair and very generous, though (if at all possible) I would verify your late husband's paternity before sending anything at all.", "Lmao is the baby even his? NTA", "Absolutely NTA. You handled situation with grace and maturity", "NTA your husband had an affair and she was a one night stand not a girlfriend she has balls and huge ones to ask for anything g including his wedding ring", "NTA. I\u2019d ask for paternity to be determined first. His fam should be able to see if there\u2019s a familial match. The wedding ring is over the line as a request. I could see parting with a shirt and maybe a book or two but the rest is over the top. You are grieving. You do not need this stress.", "NTA.\n\nShe is going to lie her face off to that kid.", "NTA. You seem to have a level head here. At some point the child should have some things. But your in laws have that I\u2019m sure. Childhood mementos etc. Affair partner does not need things from you and is out of line to ask. Especially the wedding ring. Holy cow is that crossing a line.", "NTA. She's forgetting something: she was the side piece and always will be. She's using the child so she can feel entitled to your HUSBAND'S things.

The medical staff would not concede to the fact that I knew when I conceived until my baby was born within days of original due date. They made it seem like I had an affair, as my then-husband was out of town for that time. Thankfully, he trusted me, and it didn\u2019t hurt that she came out resembling much of his family.", "Did she confirm it was a 'one night stand'? It seems very odd that she would request those items if that was the case.  \nAlso, asking for the wedding ring----she's either looking to sell it for money, or having it to pretend that she and your husband were married when the child gets older and starts asking questions.  \nListen to your lawyer and don't do anything. Best wishes at this terribly difficult time.", "Literally means nothing,  she could easily be lying about the date the child was conceived which would be impossible to prove because ut could've easily happened a few days before or after she slept with your husband. Get the Paternity and if its his go from there and if not then you owe this woman Nothing and should be able to take her to court.", "Probably. Or maybe she fixated on it while they were having the affair, some kind of \"imagine if that meant you were married to me\" thing. No matter the reason, it's crazy as hell.", "That\u2019s why I changed. To NTA but I think this kid is entitled to some of his late father thing. The sooner the better. They do cost a lot of money to raise to adulthood and they do also questions and form attachment a lot before they can do simple math.", "Less, probably. OP states that the accident was in April.", "Same day, if you're feeling frisky", "Wait -- the *medical staff* tried to insinuate you had an affair? I hope you reported them to the hospital administration. That's outrageous.", "I had something similar, my son was born on his \u201cdue date by size\u201d in the beginning. But 3 weeks after his due date per development and measurements at mid pregnancy. Was a surprise to no one that the early slow growth was because he had a vestigial twin attached on his foot. It wasn\u2019t until the twin stopped growing that my son developed normally. So I was 3 months measuring at 7 weeks duration my first scan/due date appointment. But I had had sex ONCE in 4 months so I knew it had to be further along.", "I know but I am going with believing her until proven otherwise for my own sanity because if this has been made public for nothing, it will almost be worse.", "He let me read their messages when I found out so I knew it was one time. She also confirmed this.", "Same time even"]}
