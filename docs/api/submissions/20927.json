He passed away in an accident in April.\n\nA few weeks before the accident, I found out that he had a one night stand with a woman who he works with. When he died, I hadn't decided yet what was going to happen in our relationship. We entered counselling and were still living together but obviously it was hectic. As I wasn't sure if we were going to divorce, I decided not to tell our families and only confided in a few close friends and my therapist. I didn't want opinions from everyone. I also didn't tell his family when he died, there was no reason to.\n\nA few weeks ago the affair partner reached out to me. She's 5 months pregnant and preparing to raise the baby. She wanted me to tell his family because she wants her child to have a relationship with his family and be connected to his culture. I said I wouldn't do this and simply passed along their contact information. Shit hit the fan. I am close with his brothers and I thought that they were going to raise him from the dead and kill him again (apologies for the dark humour).\n\nThey're coming around to the idea of having a relationship with the baby but I do not want to (nor has the mother offered which is fine.)\n\nThe mother has gotten back in touch with me to ask for some of my husbands possessions. She wants his clothes, his books, his record collection, and bizarrely his wedding ring. For the baby to feel connected to it's father. I've made it very clear to her that I will be giving her nothing of the sort. His parents and brother have some of his stuff and she can access things like that through them. She kept pushing and I lost my temper and called her an outrageous bitch who should find some shame.\n\nI wouldn't be opposed to passing some of the stuff along to the child via my in-laws when they're older and can appreciate it. Not the wedding ring, which was the worst request IMO but other sentimental stuff. I've also retained a lawyer to look into whether I owe the child any money legally from my husband's passing. If I don't, I may set up a trust fund for them when they're an adult with his money because I really don't need it and that seems fair. I just do not want to give this woman all I have left of my husband. I really do not trust her with any of it.\n\nObviously she thinks I'm a bitter raging monster bitch and an asshole and my in-laws are divided. My in-laws are largely supportive but some think that I need to give some of his stuff to her and the baby. Some of his brothers have told me that they're sympathetic but that I'm behaving like an asshole and a baby by not co-operating for the sake of the child. I'm unsure whether the complicated grief is clouding my judgement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: My in-laws are getting a paternity test when the baby is born. This was the first thing they asked. However, the scans and due date line up perfectly when the affair occurred so I think it is more than likely true so we are preparing for this.", "created_utc": 1688075122, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mhim9/aita_for_not_giving_the_mother_of_my_dead/", "score": 2073, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seems like you're willing to do more than you need to.  Also what exactly does your husband have that a baby would even want?", "NTA. His WEDDING RING?! 5 bucks and my left toe says that\u2019s so she can spin the tail that THEY were married and he isn\u2019t an affair baby. Absolutely not, that\u2019s bonkers", "You sound incredibly reasonable to me. You\u2019re willing to put things aside for the child, including a trust!

Nor do you have any kind of monetary obligations towards her or the baby since she was the sidepiece & not his wife. That person would be you.\n\nWhy would you even consider setting up a trust fund for a homewreckers kid? (yeah yeah, the baby is innocent, but the mom isn't) That would just give her leverage to demand more. Which she doesn't deserve.\n\nETA: Can she prove her baby is your husbands by paternity test? Any of his male relatives should be able to help with that. Not that it would negate anything I stated above. You still don't owe her a damned thing.", "Nta at the point wedding ring came out of her mouth I'd have needed people to hold me back. The in laws not 100% behind whatever you choose to do 3 months after the death are TA and I would be considering going lc/nc there. \n\nShe can turn to his family for a connection and you were generous giving her that. I would be suggesting they get a paternity test as well, she could be lying for all any of you know.", "Nta, and who's to say the child was even his and she's not just trying to get free valuable stuff?", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t give her a dime.

Wow, I'm so sorry that this is happening in your time of grief.  She has no right to demand anything.  Honestly, I wouldn't do anything now without a confirmed paternity test.

She's using the baby to guilt the family and you into having the possessions SHE wants for herself! How would a baby enjoy a record collection, books and clothes? She gave herself away when she asked for the wedding ring.\n\nThis child hasn't even been born yet and she's trying to claw what little you have left of his memory from you.\n\nThe trust fund is a great idea, and also passing along what you feel comfortable parting with via your in-laws when the child is much older.\n\nMy condolences.

I'm sure your lawyer will advise you correctly.", "Nta, wedding ring, you can't be serious", "NTA. I\u2019m confused how any of his family could find what you have offered objectionable. Offering it through in-laws when child is older is more than reasonable.\n\nThat none of them could see the unreasonableness of the asks when she asked for the ring is a bit strange. Also- I\u2019m assuming she knew he was married when they had the affair?\n\nIt really sucks but at some point you may have to go no contact with his family- especially if this woman and child will now be in their lives. Had he lived and you divorced this more than likely would have been necessary.", "NTA\n\nIt was a one night stand. I'd ask for proof of paternity and not hand over a single thing until the pregnancy ends with arrival of a healthy child.", "NTA - You could literally block her and do nothing. So anything you do do is extra.", "NTA. I could see giving her pictures (copies are fine) or some other items but his wedding ring is too far. That crosses a line. The kid is entitled to have something of his fathers but that doesn\u2019t mean it needs to come from you.", "NTA. I think a trust fund would make this AP feel even more entitled - you're welcome to do this if you wish but personally I wouldn't let her know about it at all and just give it to the kid directly when they're old enough and if they turn out semi decent (which they may not with a mother like that), and if they turn out to really be your husband's kid. \n\nYou don't seem like a monster, it sounds like the AP is actually trying to get on your nerves to get a response out of you for some sick reason. Give whatever junk from your late husband that you don't want to his relatives, nothing more or less, and they can deal with that train wreck.", "NTA.\n\nMy husband drank himself to death, which by itself is traumatic, but when his ex-wife found out she started hounding me for stuff like his watch she gave him, and other sentimental stuff.\n\nI told her I had no idea why she wanted any of this stuff because she is the one who divorced him and told her to talk to his brother, because he had everything (somewhat true).\n\nTurns out she was his side chick the last few months before he died (I found out afterwards but by the time she was his sidechick I had mentally checked out of the relationship anyways).\n\nStill, I told her to go piss up a rope. I had a lot of his stuff including the stuff she wanted, but like I said, she left him, so as far as I'm concerned she had no right to any of it. She tried to badmouth me to his trashy friends for a while, but I never wanted anything to do with most of them while he was still alive. His family likes me and we still talk, and they don't blame me for anything, they were just surprised I didn't leave him before he died.\n\nI was about to, and then he died.", "NTA. For what it\u2019s worth, I think you\u2019ve been handling the situation well and I certainly would not have given any of this a second thought. I don\u2019t even know that I would remember my partner fondly after finding out they cheated, dead or not. But since you mentioned the family already has some of his stuff, I think it\u2019s outrageous to request things like the wedding ring. You deserve to keep things for yourself and this is part of your grieving process. Nobody has a right to take that from you or tell you how to handle this, certainly not an affair partner. if you choose to give things in the future, that\u2019s a decision you get to make at a time you\u2019re ready to do so. a baby is not gonna do anything with your husband\u2019s records for at least a few years. \n\nalso from what i gathered, the mother of the child doesn\u2019t even want you to be in the kid\u2019s life. just his family. so if the family wants the child to have things so badly, they should give from their own things and not expect somebody who\u2019s not even particularly welcomed in the child\u2019s life to do so.\n\nSetting up a trust fund for this child that\u2019s not yours sounds like an amazing thing to do, and quite above and beyond. Nothing I would expect from a \u201cmonster\u201d. Also, I do hope you know for sure the child is actually your late husband\u2019s and not speculated by from the affair partner.

Though obviously your husband shared in the fault and would have had responsibility here, you have neither fault nor responsibility. If your husband's family wishes to have contact for the sake of the child, or to give the child things related to their culture, that's their right. But that has nothing whatsoever to do with you, and you needn't be involved with her at all. \n\nI realize that pregnancies  happen sometimes even when appropriate precautions are taken, but I would not take her word that your husband was the father without proof.  I agree with you that, unless your attorney advises otherwise, you owe her nothing. Even if that's the case, making sure anything you might choose to do in the future  out of kindness rather than legal obligation goes directly to the child is wise.", "NTA.", "NTA at all and don't let them pull this guilt trip on you. It was a one night stand. They didn't have a relationship and likely wouldn't have other than dealing with the child if he had lived. Tell your inlaws what you've said here about when the child is older and then tell them to stop discussing it. It's none of their business.", "Um. What. Excuse me? She... did what? And then did what? And is demanding WHAT?  Oh HELL no, what on earth is she thinking? NOPE. NOPE NOPE NOPE. That's crazy and she has no right to demand anything from the wife of the man she was sleeping with after he tragically passed away, and she has a hell of a nerve to think she's entitled to anything. \n\nNTA. OP, honey, I am so sorry you are going through this, and you are in no way in the wrong for feeling the way you do. It is beyond inappropriate for her to ask for anything beyond a couple of photographs, let alone HIS WEDDING RING?

Give yourself time to grieve, and only when you feel ready, you could consider passing some items through your in-laws as you say.

You handled situation with grace and maturity", "NTA your husband had an affair and she was a one night stand not a girlfriend she has balls and huge ones to ask for anything g including his wedding ring", "NTA. I\u2019d ask for paternity to be determined first. His fam should be able to see if there\u2019s a familial match. The wedding ring is over the line as a request.

The wedding band is another matter, her asking for that is just spiteful and hurtful. If they want his stuff give it to them, and if you learn that you don't owe the kid money then don't bother setting up the trust, it looks like your husband's family is well on their way to make sure the kid wants for nothing regardless of your feelings.

You shouldn\u2019t feel bad about keeping all of that. \n\nAs for her requests?  I think she\u2019s disgusting and absurd and using the baby as an excuse for her behavior. The fact she contacted you after sleeping with your husband is nasty and you don\u2019t need to put up with that nonsense. She should deal with your husband\u2019s parents and if necessary your lawyer. She\u2019s a shark and cares more about the things she could get than anything else.

That shows what a classless piece of work she is. \n\nIf she finds out he had anything else of value she will ask for that too. \n\nMost of the things in your shared household are probably marital property and should be all yours. His personal things like clothing don\u2019t have the sentimental value to her that you would have. Keep them until you\u2019re ready to get rid of them without regard to her.

As unfortunate and hurtful as his infidelity was, as the surviving spouse it\u2019s your sad duty to take care of your husband\u2019s obligations and unfinished business, and this is part of that. But unless your lawyer tells you otherwise, it seems justified to me to keep that in a trust for the child as an adult given the lack of trust you have in the mother and her insensitivity and outrageous demands (I can\u2019t even begin to contemplate her asking for your wedding ring.

You have no idea what this woman or his family will be like in those time frames either. Please don't give her anything. And not because \"fuck her\", but because you need to give yourself time.

That will 1. give you full control of it with no ties to mom/baby and 2. It will be cheaper not having to involve lawyers (only after it's deemed that the child has no right to the inheritance). And put the things you're willing to give her into storage. The kid will never know if his dad's stuff was around when he/she was 2... If you come back 2 or 3 years later and still have a good relationship with the family and/or her, then give it to them. But do not relinquish all of this right now. GIVE YOURSELF TIME.
