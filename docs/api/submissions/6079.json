However, his spending habits will effect my sister eventually. This past weekend he took an impulsive flight to Vegas and lost 4K while gambling. My sister told me this and she said she did not mind. \n\nI think the reason she didn\u2019t mind or acted like she didn\u2019t care is because she doesn\u2019t want to show him that she is controlling or she is a crazy fianc\u00e9. My sister has a great job and she is well off. While she cannot afford a luxury lifestyle she can still enjoy her life without worrying about poverty.

If you genuinely think there is a financial risk here that can be remedied by a prenup, having that conversation is totally a-ok, as long as you approach it in a way that doesn't impose your beliefs onto her, as it is her decision at the end of the day, not yours.\n\nCommunication is good.", "Nta, but a prenup probably won't be sufficient if he blows through money like that. If she were asking for advice, I'd recommend financial counseling as well. They need to be on the same page with regard to savings, debt, retirement, child care expenses (if applicable), insurance, etc etc etc. Sounds like he may not have financial discipline and that will make it difficult for anyone he marries. \n\nThat said, you get to suggest these things ONCE in a completely non-judgy tone. If she declines, then you have to let her make her own choices and be happy that she's following her chosen path. No nagging or recriminations if it goes to shit.", "NTA she needs a prenup!", "But what exactly would she be signing a prenup for?   \n\nDoes she own a house that she doesn't want to lose?\nDoes she have properties? Does she have lots of money saved up?   Is he in huge debt right now?  \n\nIf they get married. And he buys a car.  It's their car. So it's their debt.  Some states say if he blows all him money. Since she is married to him. That's her debt too. \n\nA prenuptial agreement is for things you have before the marriage. Not for things within the marriage.", "NAH..\n\nEveryone should get a prenup in my opinion so I am not a great judge. However, a prenup wont protect her or her finances from his gambling habits. So maybe dont use that to try to convince her.", "NTA. But only bring it up once \n\nIf my SO lost 4k, I would be a special kind of mad", "NTA\n\nBe prepared for her to refuse. Then decide whether you'll push it or if you value a relationship with her. The best way to present it might make it for \"his\" protection.", "You should recommend premarital counseling more than a prenup. They're not entering this marriage on strong grounds and they're not on the same page. This is going to be a massive problem in their relationship if they don't get ahead of it now.", "NTA! A lot of marriages fail or get really rocky due to finances. If this guy is out just dropping $4k to gamble what\u2019s his next adventure going to cost. Have the conversation with her, advise her, if not the prenup, to at least set aside money in a different account in case of a rainy day.", "If he has a gambling addiction, RIP to their finances.\n\nIf he\u2019s like this now, I\u2019d be more worried about her getting married to him. Once her income is combined with his, if they don\u2019t even sign a prenup, that\u2019s it. What does she see in this guy? Is she actually in love with him or do you think she\u2019s with him for the money? \n\nHe is going to destroy her life if she ends up tying the knot with him.\n\nNTA, but I wouldn\u2019t just suggest a prenup. I would ask her if she thinks it\u2019s a good idea to marry him period.", "NTA\n\nThis guy sounds like bad news. However, if he treats your sister well, and makes him happy, it's not your place, as other commenters have suggested, to try and mess with their relationship or tell him not to be with her.\n\nHowever, a prenup sounds like a good idea, and if you frame it as something to protect both of you, and do it tactfully, you absolutely should, and you have every right to be looking after her.", "NTA I don't see anything wrong with it I would advise a prenup in any relationship where one person was bad with their money. Just make sure she doesn't cave to him if he asks for money, a prenup won't save you if you accrue debt during marriage", "Sorry if I have this ass about but I thought a prenup was about securing an individual\u2019s assets prior to marriage. Does she have any independent assets atm?\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t then it may be a pointless endeavour that may put a wedge between you and her when she may need you on her side in the future.

If you decide to approach your sister with this, you will want to be sure she fully understands why you're suggesting it.", "Affect*. \n\nNTA. But I\u2019d be trying to talk her out of marrying him altogether. This man is reckless with his money. Is he saving for a family, retirement, emergencies or is he YOLO-ing his way through life?", "NTA. It\u2019s a legitimate concern. It\u2019s up to her though ultimately.", "NAH.

Share your opinion and trust your sister but understand this might rub her the wrong way regardless of your intentions", "NTA however I would be prepared for her to react poorly.

So is a financial education class. Ask her if she would be interested in one for the two of them as an engagement gift.

Be aware- it might open Pandora\u2019s box, but better now than in divorce court.", "NTA but I don\u2019t think a prenup will do much unless she owns a bunch of stuff. Retirement accounts, real estate, etc. \n\nI\u2019d honestly rethink the legal marriage part. Have a wedding, have the party, get the gifts, just don\u2019t sign any legal paperwork. He\u2019s likely going to screw her over financially later whether it\u2019s on purpose or not.", "NAH as this conflict would be between you and your sister.  You would not be the asshole for suggesting one but a prenup is only going to protect pre-existing assets should the marriage break down.\n\nShe could easily be bankrupted by him or eliminate her savings with a pre-nup.  Joint bank accounts, her taking out lines of credit on her property, stopping saving due to increased spending.\n\nRather than discussing a pre-nup I would focus on understanding her financial plans.  Any shared debt, assets, bank accounts credit cards?  Have they talked about budgets and personal saving and household savings", "NTA but will a prenup help in this situation? It is to be used if the relationship ends in divorce. He could spend all her money and put her into debt before it leads to divorce.

It's not necessarily being an \"asshole\" to bring up the possibility of a prenup, but rather being proactive and looking out for your sister's best interests. \n\n**It's important** to approach this conversation with care and understanding, and to try to listen to your sister's perspective and concerns. Ultimately, the decision about whether or not to get a prenup is up to your sister and her fiance, but it's important that they have all of the necessary information to make an informed decision.", "NTA. You're looking out for her.", "NTA, Prenups used to be called marriage contracts, and where the standered untill big daddy gubament decided they wanted to nose in on it and make a marriage \"lioysence\" which  basicly makes you ask daddy gubament to get married.... Also... WTF... He is currently you brother in law, as in allready married to another sister?", "NTA, your concerns are valid, but you have to be very careful with how you approach the subject since it's a very sensitive topic for many. Best of lucks.", "Yea a prenup won't do any good if she doesn't say no too him", "Wait, there is no option in the US to not combine your assets when you marry someone? In my country you can just choose that option, it makes your assets and finances legally separated through the marriage as well. It basically works like before you get married - what you bought with your own money is still yours, and your husband has no rights to it. Same with salary, you could be married for 15 years, but that money is still yours. It also means your spouse's debt etc is theirs alone. I always thought that this is a fairly standard possibility in most countries, but even if not, is it not possible to write a prenup that would allow to settle things that way?"]}
