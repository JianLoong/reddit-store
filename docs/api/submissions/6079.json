In my country you can just choose that option, it makes your assets and finances legally separated through the marriage as well. It basically works like before you get married - what you bought with your own money is still yours, and your husband has no rights to it. Same with salary, you could be married for 15 years, but that money is still yours. It also means your spouse's debt etc is theirs alone. I always thought that this is a fairly standard possibility in most countries, but even if not, is it not possible to write a prenup that would allow to settle things that way?", "YWBTA if you meddle, she\u2019s aware of the risks and won\u2019t listen to you anyway.", "YTA\n\nShe's an adult.

But it's probably better if they don't get married and keep their finances completely separate. \n\nA prenup protects what she has now and how she'll need to maintain him when they divorce but she can still lose everything she earns while they are married to his recklessness.

Rather than approach that, I'd suggest you lightly, without a tone of judgment, suggest she keep her own private bank account and he keep his - they can have a joint for all household expenses that set amounts go into each month or some such, but that way she's not losing 4,000 of HER paycheck to a whim.", "YTA.

But there are ways to protect assets you enter the marriage with and inheritance. \n\nI'm surprised you can split assets like that. So if you choose that option at 23, then one becomes a stay at home parent and the other becomes a billionaire, the stay at home parent leaves with nothing because it was all separate?", "> Wait, there is no option in the US to not combine your assets when you marry someone?\n\nIn general...no.  You can separate/protect your pre-marital assets (that's what a pre nup is for), but you cannot protect future earnings, even if they are derived from things established pre-marriage.  So for example, if I start a business before I get married, money generated from that business during marriage is marital assets and can be spent by my spouse.  I believe there are certain corner cases where you can protect a small number of future things (like inheritance), but in general a US marriage is a legal binding financial contract.  A lot of people, like /u/chesshead1990 I feel, misunderstand what a prenup can and cannot do.  If you are married, and your spouse makes a bunch of money, you can spend that money.", "NTA - \n\nWhat a prenup will do: trigger an important conversation about finances and what happens in certain scenarios. They also will have to outline their assets and liabilities- so your sister will get a preview of what she\u2019s signing up for in case she doesn\u2019t already know. It can also define what is community / not community property during marriage (limits of this may depend on state). This is good for if either of them own a biz or something like that. \n\nMore importantly it can protect your sisters existing assets in case it\u2019s a quick marriage and outline things like spousal support, etc. \n\nNote that they both typically need to lawyer up. The prenup can be one sided but his lawyer will try to explain pros/cons make suggestions to protect him in case of divorce. \n\nWhat a prenup won\u2019t do: fix bad financial habits and protect sister from the consequences.", "A prenuptial is to protect assets, it can't protect against your partner being a spendthrift. They will still be a bad partner never being able to carry their share of the load. How does a prenuptial help pay for raising kids, buying a home, goals, retirement? What happens if you are disabled or laid off?", "NTA he thinks she is his personal bank", "I don't think she needs a prenup but maybe should keep her money separate from his. Ultimately you can make a suggestion, but it is her decision.", "NTA. People need to stop demonizing prenups. You never know what way things will turn and this makes it so a divorce will go smoother. It\u2019s something that needs to be mutually agreed upon.", "Definitely suggest it but also set a limit about financial help if she does not. Make your boundary now before she loses her house. NTA for acknowledging the red flags we all are seeing.", "In community property states you can have a separate property agreement that your earnings do not become community property. (Don't know what non-community states do).\n\nBut this requires strict separation of assets so can't use the other partner's credit for purchases, have to keep all income separated, everything titled to one spouse, etc.\n\nAnd if his income is larger than hers, even if sporadic, she may be shooting herself in the foot.", "NAH for sure. See, I've never understood why a pre-nup is viewed as a sensitive topic. What is more romantic than a pragmatic approach to finances? It'll stop fights or resentments later in the marriage as you both know where you stand, and gives personal protection to the assets you held alone/ before marriage. \n\n\nYes, I am a lot of fun at parties, and I will also advocate for people to have a will in place lol", "This is the way", "It didn't day Sis had any assets\n Just said fiance is a spendthrift.

Bring up your concerns, but if your sister\u2019s happy and content with how he spends his/their money and decides not to do anything about it than you need to let it go. You don\u2019t know their entire financial picture.", "A prenup can protect assets she brings into the marriage in the event of a divorce, they won't stop her from debt he takes on during the marriage or spending money she brings into joint accounts.  What they actually need is to sit down with a financial advisor and have a frank discussion about budgets,spending, debt, goals, comingling of funds and expectations and make sure they are aligned", "I don\u2019t think a prenup will help in this situation.  A prenup is for things you bring into the marriage, ex a house, or if she had a lot of savings before the marriage or an inheritance etc. But it won\u2019t help her if he will just spend them into debt.  Best thing she could do is either speak to him and get financial counselling or make sure she has a way to save money every paycheck incase she does go crazy she\u2019ll at least have money for bills.  Honestly she should be reconsidering the marriage until he gets his spending under control", "Yeah that is why marriage has zero benefit unless you are significantly poorer than your spouse. Otherwise it is nothing more than a massive expense. Especially if you own more assets than your partner going into the marriage.\n\nThe only way your assets are protected is if they were inherited. But anything you earned yourself is free game in event of divorce.", "Who cares whether or not it\u2019s romantic? This is the most common and also the absolute dumbest reason I\u2019ve heard for people being against prenups \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Yes, technically that's how it would work. Of course you still can fight in court during the divorce, but in that instance, it would be probably very difficult for the SAHP to get much, aside from alimony for kids. But you can change this later on, it doesn't have to stay the way it was at the time of the wedding, I know couples who had the standard option, so everything is a marital asset, and then later changed it to separate assets. Mostly you'd do that for example if one of the spouses decides to open their own company, and you want the salary of the other spouse to not be affected by any debt if things went sideways. It only works forward though, so if you're already in debt, the change will not do anything for you. Other than that, the main day to day difference is that if you have shared assets as a married couple, you can file your taxes together and get tax bonuses - if you have separate assets, you're not entitled to the bonus. The majority of people still choose to have shared assets - maybe because that is the default option, when you get married and don't specifically go and take care of keeping things separate, you have shared assets from that moment onwards. The separate assets also don't matter when it comes to inheritance, as it is based on relationship and not which option you have, so the spouse will inherit everything by default (unless there are children, then the spouse gets half and the other half is divided between the children). You can make a will, of course, but that would be a default regardless of the asset division.", "Yeah that's why I'm asking, because in my country it does, so I was surprised that it's not possible in the US.
