Your part is that you should just say \"No I Don't babysit\" but not just slamming the door.\n\nYour aunt sucks, because she cannot demand babysitting from family even if they have a free day.\n\nthe other adults sucks because they should speak with you calmly.", "NTA\n\nYour mom wasn't there to be a willing babysitter. Nor were any of those other family members. Maybe your entitled aunt should try the other family member's homes first.\n\nIf it ever happens again, just don't even bother to get up.", "NTA. How old is the kid? No offense to 16 yr olds but if the kid is really young not sure how I would feel about leaving them with a 16 yr old unless it was for like less than an hour. But she ditches the kid all the time so it would seem that wouldn't be a concern for the aunt.", "NTA\n\nI'm a deep sleeper. I wouldn't have even gotten up to check the door. Just look through a peep hole next time and ignore her.", "NTA call the police for child abandonment I\u2019m sure that would make the message clear and create a little more drama", "NTA No one should ever have a child just dumped on their doorstep with no advance call. And never get paid??\n\nGee, y'all are the best day care ever! Free and no rules. Where do I sign up?", "NTA I wouldn't even have opened the door", "NTA. You're 16yo, you should NEVER be responsible for a child that is not yours unless you're being paid for it. If this is an arrangement between your mom and her sister it's up to them, but you should never be involved or obligated to anything.", "NTA\nIf your relatives are so angry have them babysit her kids", "NTA, I get that stuff happens but your mom always letting your aunt get away with this kind of crap must be super annoying. It sounds like you\u2019re being put last when in comparison to your cousin, not to mention, you\u2019re not a professional babysitter or a child care center. So it really isn\u2019t your job to take care of her kid. Your aunt is a mother, a parent. She needs to be more present with her child, because the only thing her kid is gonna remember when they look back at their childhood is constantly being pawned off to other people.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have open the door, I have done that with guest that just show up.  I pretend I wasn\u2019t home and tell them next time they should call ahead. Even if they are suspicious, they can\u2019t say anything.  \n\nMy cousins do this to me too, especially after the pandemic. I work 5 am to 2 pm which is when most schools let out, so I\u2019m stuck with the kids from 2-3 pm to 5-6 pm.  It\u2019s not too bad but I do miss my after work naps.", "ESH you were rude, your aunt was crossing the line big time, your mom is enabling, and the other relatives are dropping responsibility they don't want on a minor. \n\nBut one thing that stuck with me. Really your mom picks you up from school every day? At 16? Wow, you have it nice. (I'm not saying she shouldn't if she is able to, but I really hope you appreciate her and let her know that, being picked up daily by a parent at 16 is not common where I'm from)", "NTA. No one has the right to just forcibly indenture relatives. She doesn\u2019t make the plan ahead of time or treat your time with respect.", "NTA. She\u2019s exploiting you. Good on you for not letting yourself be used. But you are likely to get in trouble.", "What\u2019s the aunt gonna do if you don\u2019t open the door at all? \nShe should call first.\nNTA", "She'll get hit with ''I minded you when you were a child'' as if you owe them, I was manipulated into providing tens of thousands worth of free babysitting when I was a teenager", "Whey can't mother put brat in car and pick OP up?", "No one should be walking in the rain imo.", "No! This is the way! It is never awful to DO a bad thing! It is only awful to ADDRESS the bad thing!", "Right? To me it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s sunny and beautiful outside, just take responsibility for your own damn kid! NTA", "Yeah... that's weird that all of them were quite so offended. I wonder if OP is asian? My family did this. I got tired of my aunts and uncles ridiculing my mom for not having as much education as them. At a restaurant where we were all eating, they were doing it again and I finally told them to shut up and have some respect. Mom chose to work to contribute to the family income. They went to school partially with the money mom made. They all looked at me like I sprouted horns and became the devil himself and all of them came at me, mom included. They ridiculed me for ironically demanding respect when I didnt give it. Which is true I thought later. But also, respect is earned and I thought their mentality was crap. The thing is... I still dont get why mom got mad too. I will never understand that part of my culture.", "This. Just because someone rings the bell does not mean you have to open the door. I only answer when I have INVITED them over.\n\nGoes for your phone too.", "Nah. Open it and let them know you're not interested in free labor. Avoiding conflict doesn't resolve the issue, just kicks it down the road to a future date.", "If you open the door you give your aunt the opportunity to drop off her kid and run. Don\u2019t open the door.", "Perfect answer!  Put it off on them!", "Ask them point blank in front of everyone when THEY will watch the kid.\nHave a sign up sheet ready.\n\nCall them out!\n\nEDIT:  NTA", "Just a reminder that OP to is a kid that needs taking care of as well. That includes not being left in the rain. If OPs mom can't watch/take care/protect BOTH kids at the same time, then she shouldn't watch both kids at the same time. And who NEEDS to come 1st for OPs mom? That's right OP. Op could get sick at the very least from walking in the rain so often. Not to mention they could get mugged or something while walking home.", "This is the perfect solution!", "Not enabling per se.\n\nJust preventing that kid being dropped at *their* place.", "Okay, I totally agree that OP is not the AH, but this response is odd. 16 year olds babysit frequently without their mothers around. Normally they're asked. And paid. But OP may very well be capable.", "Good thing to threaten but it will start a war, lol!", "*enabling.\n\nThis is the best run-on sentence I've ever read!", "Mom wasn't home for this incident. The child was going to be dumped on OP. That's more than an inconvenience. Lord knows how many times this had already happened. If this was the 1st instance, I guarantee that it will happen again in the future.", "If it's a last minute thing, OP may not have an umbrella or jacket. If their backpack or book bag isn't waterproof, there's also the potential for electronics to be ruined", "That's exactly what the aunt deserved. Dumping a kid to be babysat with no warning is always an AH move.", "I'm not sure where OP is, but winter just happened and a winter rain can certainly mess with your immune system and make you susceptible to illness.", "Most kids today have electronics like laptops or cell phones that will be ruined by walking home in the rain and having their bag soaked. The aunt should have the courtesy to give them a child car seat to go pick up the daughter with.", "Yup, they can see the future. The aunt dumping her kid in their doorstep. They'd wanna stop it at all cost.", "It's sad cause she's pawning off her kid so often and soon it'll start making the child feel like a burden", "They don't want to deal with the aunt.  She's pitching an epic fit (possibly has a LONG history of such?) and almost ANYTHING seems preferable.", "It could also be a family of enablers. NTA", "Oooh! I love this idea!!!", "de gracia\n\nThank you", "With that aunt, war is a matter of time, unless the plan is continual surrender.\n\nBest to pick the battlefield and time for best advantage.", "The sad truth is that OP is screwed either way and her family won't stand up for her, so she will have to do it herself.\n\nShe should not make it a threat, but a warning. Inform aunt that if her sister (OP's mom) is okay with babysitting and will be at home there is no problem.\n\n**BUT** if mom is not home or if she is but will leave soon and therefore leave OP responsible, she will call either CPS or the police for child abandonement. And then actually do it.\n\nOn top of that, OP should message them (either individually or on the group family) afterwards stating the above so it doesn't end up being a \"he said she said\" situation.", "It's a typo, it happens from time to time.", "I used to have to ride or walk home in the rain regularly (sunny in the morning, clouds come at lunch, pouring on the way home). It doesn't kill us (especially I'm summer) but when it's because your aunt can't get her shit together enough to even call beforehand with a hey can you watch x today, yeah I would be pissed and slam the door in their face. Why do I need to constantly show respect to people who continually refuse to show it to me.", "She\u2019s not calling because then they might say no. She knows if she just shows up and drops off the kid that she\u2019ll get away with it.", "\u201cWhen I was your age I walked to school and back in the snow! Uphill both ways! With dogs chasing me!\u201d\n\nJust because things sucked for you doesn\u2019t mean they need to suck for everyone.", "It could ruin all her papers, her textbooks, library books school technology etc.", "[deleted]", "Why ask permission when she can just ask for forgiveness", ">\u201cWhen I was your age I walked to school and back in the snow! Uphill both ways! With dogs chasing me!\".\n \"That explains why you don't know anything now, you never had a chance to learn  anything\"", "And get my lawn. Damn it!", "Not to mention, today\u2019s kids have to carry laptops and other expensive electronics that aren\u2019t waterproof\u2026most backpacks aren\u2019t waterproof so not only is it a significant inconvenience it\u2019s also risking school and personal property that is expensive to replace.", "Obviously you have never lived somewhere where the weather report says Sunny in the morning and then you end up with pouring rain by the end of the day.", "And you act like meteorologists are never wrong.\n\nWhere I grew up, our local weather man was nicknamed \"x the liar\" because he was notoriously unreliable. This was early to mid-2000s, so there were no easy smartphone apps with weather forecasts. We also lived in an area with an island off the coast, and half the time we did have rain predicted it would go down the outside of the island and miss us completely.", "I don't get the feeling she is even asking for forgiveness, lol", "I truly don't get your lawn.", "Oops. It was get OFF my lawn. Damn stupid phone."]}
