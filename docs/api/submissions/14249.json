Especially in an age where most kids are carrying expensive electronics in their pockets. It's not like \"Oh, you just get wet\" anymore - you might actually lose thousands of dollars worth of gear.\n\nI remember once my school laptop (which was *mandatory*, and we had to bring it home with us every day - weren't allowed to leave them at school) got destroyed in a surprise thunder storm as I was walking home. It rained so hard that my house flooded; so of course, the rain got through the plastic case *and* backpack that my laptop was stored in, and it broke. Tbh even if I'd left the damn thing at home - which I wasn't allowed to do - it still would've been destroyed, because the house flooded.\n\nThe school then blamed me for this literal act of god, because \"Water damage of any kind\" was not covered by the insurance. Even rain water. And I had to pay out of *my* pocket to get the mandatory school laptop replaced so that I could pass my classes.\n\nGod forbid if that storm had caught me a year later - when, in addition to the mandatory laptop, we *also* had mandatory binders that *all* of our schoolwork had to go in, that didn't fit in anyone's bags. So everyone was just... holding them, out in the open, all the time.", "I didn\u2019t prepare to deal with bad weather so OP should just suck it up, fucking clueless lmao\n\nIf I\u2019m expecting a ride home and not having to deal with the weather why should I be bringing extra things with me in case something unexpected happened?\n\nShould op just live there life now on the assumption that their cousin is just going to be there all the time and they should just carry everything they could POSSIBLY need every day?\n\nThe aunt needs to act like a grownup and a parent that can actually parent, they can\u2019t even communicate to their own family when they need assistance, aunts treating the rest of the family like they\u2019re a convenience\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have entertained talking to them either, you wake me up from my sleep and you get what you get, unannounced unwelcome toil gets well warranted attitude", "Not everyone has the same constitution. Just cuz you survived it does make it right.", "You are not summer!", "Lucky you. I did the same, but with nothing but newspapers wrapped around my feet, and I had to walk a mile into town for a slice of bread. And I did it all with a smile because I was grateful to not be barefoot.", "I am going to chalk this comment up to America-centrism. I'm German and my parents stopped picking me up from school sometime during grade 1 of elementary school, as did the parents of almost all the kids. And yeah, rain and snow days included.\n\nWalking in the rain isn't fun, but it's also not the end of the world. The complaint about the forced babysitting is valid, but \"sometimes I'm not chauffeured around\" is not the validating factor.", "And laptop?  To the best of my knowledge my backpack is drop resistant but not deluge proof.  Ie... A full bottle of water with a lay on top and I found water inside.  Thankfully my computer was fine.\n\nOh I see school technology there.... All inclusive....", "Getting a bit wet walking home from school is not suffering.  Sure it can be uncomfortable but at the end you are home and can change into dry clothes quickly.  I am staggered that you think people who had to walk home from school in the rain now need therapy.", "I believe you may have missed the sarcasm in the above comment.", "You had _newspapers_?? You were lucky. I had to walk ten miles in bare feet with no breakfast and after school I had to work down the mine til bedtime and go to bed without any tea.", "The sarcasm in this comment is so subtle as to be absolutely beautiful", "Schools charge families for damaged electronics if they can too", "My son takes his laptop to school because School ipad is slow. Yup, walking in rain a risk to technology.", "Right, wtf... walking in rain is not some sort of abuse, it's rain, and rain can happen on the sunny days as well, it's not pleasant sure.. but it's not the end of a fucking world. If its that bad that the rain traumatises you, maybe take a bus next time.", "And textbooks.", "Thank you. Everyone else here doesn't get it and those saying, \"Oh but technology/textbooks.\" We had mobiles, iPod, mp3 players, and textbooks. we had all that, and we carried plastic bags to protect them the best way we could if anything happened, and we got caught in the rain. We had the same rules of \"you break it you buy it\" with our schools and parents, so nothing is new there either. \n\nThey are all acting like getting wet is the end of the world, it's not, the problem is that a child (OP,) can't rely on their parents to keep their word to pick them up because the aunt can't get her shit together and be considerate of other people's lives.", "I got to graduate with the summer school kids because my school changed my math class midway through the year and fucked up their tracking of my textbooks, they claimed that I never gave it back because I got it from my 1st teacher and returned it to them so I never gave the book I never received from the class I was in\n\n$100 for my diploma", "Ah, missed opportunity for an \"old man yells at clouds\" techno-rant.\n\nWe wouldn't have missed that back in my day. No one wants to work anymore...", "Phone: sure, I'M the stupid one."]}
