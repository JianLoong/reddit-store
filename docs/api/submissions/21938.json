It's an absolute last resort to protecting the life of yourself or loved ones. If you can't get away, or escaping would place your life in additiobal danger (like being held up at knife point and your only avenue of escape is to cross a busy roadway) and the only other means of escape is through force, up to and including deadly force, then, and only then, can you use deadly force and have a valid defense in court (if the prosecutor decides to pursue it that far....and there are many trying to make a name for themselves that will for political brownie points).\n\nCarrying concealed is an alternative to open carrying, and can allow for an additional level of anonymity in public and element of surprise in an unavoidable altercation. If you're carrying concealed and the average person can tell you're carrying, you're doing it wrong. In the cirriculum I teach (common in many firearms curriculum), you have a legal and moral responsibility to avoid conflict and going into known dangerous areas (for example, a dark alley in a sketchy area). There's a lot of laws in place dictating what justifies deadly force. \n\nIt's not a junior police badge, invincibility shield, or GOOJF card for bad behavior. Actually, possessing a CPL places you under additional charges for unjustified use, carry, or brandishing of a firearm. One of the issues I have with a disturbingly sizeable minority of carriers is the very attitude I mentioned above and don't consider training as important, much less a responsibility. I've physically disarmed and gained control over a Fudd security guard (on duty, in the office away from public eyes) to demonstrate to him how effective his gun was in an altercation with his level of training. He was pissed, but he realized that there's zero excuse to carry and not seek as much training and education possible. That lesson was actually something that was taught to me offline by a PD training officer when I asked him out of curiosity why some part of the weapons retention training was important (it was something really small and seemingly mundane or useless....it was not), it was a naive question for certain, but it was a good question and absolutely vital lesson.", "Fair point.", "I mean that's why I think it is the US.
