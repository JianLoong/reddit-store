A dckwad, on the other hand is a tissue containing a collection of useless genetic material and male seminal fluids that is actively dying and going nowhere but in the trash.\n\nSo, think about it. Which described him better?\n\nNTA", "I live in the states and I'd argue that mother fkr is worse than cnt because who wants to be a mother fkr??", "I can't think of anything worse really about me. Going at my mom or gf would be worse but there's no single insult that would cause the same level of response which is a guaranteed escalation to a fist fight and threats.", "Fair enough take. I just don't out of experience. I almost got into a fight with someone when I told them several times I wanted to not speak to them, then told them to ef off and they jumped up saying don't tell him to ef off and that he would beat me up to teach me respect. I just left and now I don't swear as much at people I don't know.", "Agreed. Is why I gave verdict ESH. They were rude but OP didn't need to call him a C. Which is also just not a nice insult to use.", "Yea where I'm from this is about the worst thing you could say to someone while I've met Australians who say it every tenth word it seems. I would already be at the point of and expecting to throw punches if I called someone that.", "That sucks. I think this guy is exactly what you called him, and there's really no more explanation to it than that.", "Thank I genuinely really appreciate that", "So I would be allowed to respond to this person for touching my stuff if I had paid for the co-working space?", "Or.. or hear me out.... It was just a dude being a d*ck to a woman. Happens literally every day. I've literally had guys yell at me for asking them to let me get into my car in a parking lot when they are hanging out in their car next to it with their door open. The dude should never have touched her stuff in the first place, but when told she was still there and still using it, it is not his job to police her work habits. Not everyone can work continuously, and to tell her she's not working correctly because she sipped her coffee? In a working space where everyone is there to work their separate remote jobs, aka dude isn't her manager.... You realize he's 100% in the wrong here right. OP just called him on his BS.", "They moved my stuff on the table I was using neither the plug or stuff were in the way of others - I genuinely have no idea why he moved the other stuff, at first I assumef he unplugged my laptop because they wanted to use it, I was only after he asked what I wanted to do about it that I noticed he wasn't even using the socket he removed my  plug from", "Is your reading comprehension subpar?", "Fuck that. Get an employee and have them handle the belligerent customer next time. It's their job to keep their AH customers from screaming at their non-AH customers. If he was loud enough to bother you, then he was loud enough to bother other patrons. Who knows who he harrassed next after you left.\n\nNTA.", "Don\u2019t let entitled jerks like this win op.", "A lot of dads", "I dunno, my husband is pretty pleased with recently being upgraded to a grandmotherfucker.", "There's a whole catagory in porn called Mothers I Like to Fuck", "Touching and moving people's stuff is now on the same level as mean words that are hurting your fee fees :(", "The people that actually have to work there might be a little more obligated to deal with your bullshit in their space.", "A clear NTA then. These things would have been good to include in your post, just saying.", "Never heard of taking two tables to work? He didn\u2019t specify from which table they moved his stuff. No need to be a dick.", "Sorry you are right I should have made this clearer but I'm still a little shaken up over it at the moment", "Look in the mirror first, bud. You were extremely rude and now your lil feefees are hurt hahaha"]}
