I wish you the best.", "yeah I guess, my parents wanted me to buy him a bottle of wine with it. I'm more than happy to do that since he's a great father, but I don't really see how this scenario specificially calls for that because we both did equal work then split the chairs.", "Yep, I talked to them first about selling, and I updated them on how it was going, and they only brought this up now.", "I do work, and at the moment I live rent free as they said they'll only start charging me once I turn life 20 something", "and NTA", "100%, they also live down the street from someone throwing away $1000k plus chairs for free.

Just because he\u2019s 18 doesn\u2019t mean a barricade needs to be made around the house and he\u2019s kicked out on his own. Most parents (if theyre financially able) would love to have their kids live at home and save money. I hate it when parents make their kids feel like burdens just because they\u2019re magically \u201cadults\u201d now. \n\nOp your parents shouldn\u2019t be guilting you into a portion of your profit. They have a perfectly good chair they can also sell. But if they\u2019re willing to drop it over a bottle of wine maybe just get one and have fun drinking it together, and make sure you sit in the remaining chair for dominance lol", "I'd buy the wine before they decide you just keep the chair money, but they want rent.", "Weird Nta but very weird they brought that up now", "Okay that\u2019s fine if that\u2019s the agreement and you make money anyway it does sound like it\u2019s specifically the chair they feel entitled to and not a cut of your money for living costs.

Suffer through living in dodgy suburbs to afford rent until you get a better job. \nOr appreciate your rent-free existence a bit more and sling your Dad some dollars.", "I have never heard this? I know loads of people who moved out at 18. That said rents are going up like crazy right now and there is a lot of competition for rentals so it could be a practical issue.", "As an Australian you are incorrect. You\u2019re legally an adult at 18 and no one is responsible for you.\n\nHowever, you cannot claim government support payments until 22 unless you can prove you are financially independent from your parents (which means working full time for a year). \n\nAs someone who moved out at 17 and wasn\u2019t able to claim study assistance through uni, it\u2019s actually kind of shit - because it doesn\u2019t matter if your parents actually do or don\u2019t support you.", "You literally just made this up.", "It's dependent on state from what I've heard, I think my mum said in SA it's 18. I think in another state it was 17 I can't fully remember though so please fact check me if that's wrong.", "You're probably thinking of child support payment requirements. You must pay child support until your dependent child completes secondary schooling (high school). Recently in NSW, Australia the education curriculum changed and the final year of high school could be split across two years. It was big news at the time, designed to reduce stress/anxiety/depression triggered by multiple end of year exams.\n\n\nThe school system is different in each state but across the country you would typically finish when aged 17-18. This change meant some students could now finish at ages 18-19, and obligations to continue paying child support are extended a year longer than usual as high school is extended a year longer.\n\n\nAlso, the comments about government support payments not automatically classing someone as \"independent\" until 22 are correct. Of course there are exceptions, if, buts and maybes.", "Do not do this, OP. You owe your parents nothing. Your chair, your decision.  If you lived away from them, I feel that they\u2019d still be giving you a hard time for selling the chair.  NTA. Enjoy the proceeds of the sale.", "Probably that to. I just remember reading that parents are eligible for child benefit until 19 which made me think that must be the time they stop being legally financially responsible for children.", "You can get youth allowance and rent assistance if you're studying full time.", "Ok. That makes sense. I definitely made an assumption there based on how things are in my country. Here, you would be hard pressed to find a landlord to rent to you if your parents are legally still responsible for you unless your parents co signed for your rental. It's definitely shit and just assumed parents are actually good ones. I also moved out before I reached 18 and put myself in some pretty dangerous circumstances to get by.", "As in families getting government financial assistance? I'm Australian and moved out at 16. I still don't understand what OP means by not being able to.", "Only if you\u2019re \u201cindependent\u201d which as I said requires you to be 22 or have already worked full time for a year or your parents are low income and have no assets."]}
