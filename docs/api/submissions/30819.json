Now my son is 16 and in collage and work so I ask him to only pay for his food and he cooks his own food (he's training to be a chef so this works out best for him and for us).

They should have discussed that beforehand though, instead of after the fact.\n\nAlso, how you are spending your money may be a factor. If you are not paying rent, and you're using that money to buy something you don't need, that's disrespectful and taking advantage of your parents.

Parents especially the mum are TA in the sense they are guilt tripping their son for money they could get themselves", "Irrelevant, they can still sell the other chair.", "At what age is one not a literal child anymore there?", "Was just going to say the same...\nThey are so bent out of shape over OP wanting to sell this chair that he found...yet the father has the same exact chair that he can choose to sell just like OP!", "Except that isn't a case of that. \n\nHe found a chair and he sold it, it has nothing to do with his father or his mother.", "Here, I'd say people start actually being treated as adults when they hit about 23 but due to things such as rising cost of living, rising house prices, rising rent prices, rising everything prices, people aren't really expected to move out until they get a full career at around 25. The only reason my brother can afford a house is becuse his girlfriends dad owns it", "Now you're acting like a child. :D", "The two of you are both right and wrong. The issue comes from which definition of \u201cliteral\u201d you\u2019re using; original commenter is using its contranym definition where you\u2019re using its original. Both are correct, but regarding the other\u2019s phrase they are wrong.

So both right, yet conflicting. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "I am literally a child, why are you surprised?", "NTA. I\u2019ve never understood a parent that wants money out of their children. My mother used to be famous for this kind of thing, asking me for money for gifts my father had given myself and my wife years prior after his death. What solved it for me, was being very clear as to what constitutes something that is a gift, a loan, or a sale. It was uncomfortable at 1st but went a long way towards repairing the relationship with my mom.", "NTA! Why on earth does your dad think that he's entitled to the money. It's your money!", "Then this might be a way to help.  Offer a percentage.", "NTA. Tell Dad to sell his.", "NTA. If your dad wants to sell his he can keep the money from his chair.", "NTA but your folks are. Stand firm but politely turn the conversation to other topics when they bring it up.", "NTA you each got one chair. You dad uses his and you sold yours. WHY does your dad expect some of the money you received for selling your chair? Your chair = your money.", "Nta\nTruthfully his generation had it easier than you will.\nIt is a parents job to help elevate their kids.\n\nDon't fall for this. Just tell him answer clearly and ask him to drop it. No more debating.", "If you are living at home rent free, then you by right should give them a portion of the profits made.", "NTA tell him you want the money for your half of his chair!", "NTA he definitely had the option to just sell his and get money if that's what he wanted, he chose the chair. He can live with his decisions ...", "Why doesn't dad sell his chair???", "Offer to help your dad sell his chair and tell him you\u2019ll share profits if both chairs are sold.", "NTA you owe your parents nothing. If you want to give them money than give them money, if not then don\u2019t parents can be sad they didn\u2019t get any money but shouldn\u2019t make their kid feel guilty.", "You both got a chair.him recieving said chair is equal pay for equal work.\nHe had not effort in your selling of your chair,but also had the same choice to sell the chair and get the same money you got. He chose not to so he can go kick a chair for all its worth. You don't owe him a cent.", "NTA. You and your dad had one chair apiece. Your dad could sell the chair and have a similar amount of money. He wants to actually have his cake and eat it - keep one chair and get the money for the other.\n\nIt might be different if your dad found the chairs and brought them home and gave OP one, and OP sold it then, but it doesn't seem like that.", "So based on a few factors already mentioned\n1. OP and their parents have agreed to not paying rent until they are in their twenties and are out of school\n2. OP does work but with their high school final exams, they haven't been working as frequently due to the priority around studying.\n3. The parents did not care what OP did with chairs until they found out the chair was being sold so it seems unreasonable especially as they also have a chair they could sell.\n4. This is one of many previous arrangements OP has made with a parent regarding roadside furniture. Only difference was potential profits. \n5. The fact that reasonably unused furniture worth potentially 1000's was being thrown away freely would suggest that money isn't necessarily an issue.\n\nTl;dr. Parents and by extension, OP do not seem to be struggling financial for if they were. All the chairs would be sold for greater profit, OP also has an agreement not to pay keep until they leave school. Seems as if parents are trying to take the reward of OP's efforts. Only to guilt trip him for his reluctance.", "My Dad and I found them together. We decided that we'd each get one for our joint effort in loading them into the truck and finding them. I have not spent the money yet and am saving it. I am not paying rent as in Australia (Sydney where I live) it's impossible to move out unless you're an adult with a steady 5+ figure job. They said they'd only start charging once I'm a proper adult (mid 20s).", "I've offered them all of my money in the past ($4kish) to which they refused. I've offered them money on countless occasions to which they refuse. The truck that was used did belong to my Dad, however the chair was still transportable as the walk was around 10min back to my house. I don't care too much about my future inheritance anyways, and I offered to buy them stuff and give them money as an appreciation for all their support to which they refused.", "Do a quick Google search of the brand OP said then tell us if they were a few bucks as well as there being the pre existing arrangement to have a chair each to with it as they please. OP decided to sell his of his own choice and intuition and is now bring guilt tripped to give what is the profits of his choice away... two sides to every perspective buddy.", "I don't pay any bills atm, however they said they'd only start charging me once I reach 25ish due to the insane housing and renting prices in Sydney that is completely unaffordable for me.", "My friend was compensated for their time and effort, so no worries on that part.", "They have not been spending any money on things that I could not afford. I have not been bailed out, I don't own a car, I haven't broken any thing nor have I caused ay financial troubles. I would totally agree with you, however they have not covered for me financially in anything as of now besides school and healthcare related things to which I was not an adult yet so only they could consent to the paying of it.", "I don't, and I have offered (all my money at the time which was $4kish which I saved up for a while), in which they refused even a dollar.", "Depends on location. OP has mentioned that parents have agreed not to charge keep till he has left school. If the parents made the effort to help him sell the chair then I'd agree that they should be compensated by they didn't. What OP does with the chair is ultimately up to him and so if he wants to make the sale with his friend who is helping sell the chair then they should be the ones to benefit as effort was put in.", "$700, in which I have 10% ($70) to my friend for helping me sell it. If you think the price for his cut is low that's fair, however we both agreed on the cut together.", "For them it's not about the money apparently but rather the principle (which I am confused by in this case.", "I've offered them all of my money ($4kish) to which they've refused even a dollar.", "Whether you're paying rent or not is completely irrelevant. Your parents are being greedy and ridiculous. NTA.", "I think you are NTA for the simple fact about how they went about trying to force you to share. They should have sat you down and had a calm adult discussion and come to some kind of compromise.\n\nOh, and that wasn't the only reason. As others have said, you are only 18, and it's hard to get a job to either pay your parents something for staying there or to be able to support yourself. With this economy and the housing  crisis,  they need to have a little patience. I suggest that when u do get a job, regardless of if they ask for money, since you live there too.  or not, you should contribute to the household.", "She said she lives in the same country as I do and for some people, it\u2019s difficult.", "Interesting", "They said they're only gonna start charging me rent once I reach my mid 20s, but I offered in the past to contribute to rent/affording a new place in which they declined (the amount was everything that I've saved over 2-2.5 years being roughly $4k).", "I've had a job for 3 year and offered them all of the money I've made ($4kish) on multiple occasions to which they've refused even a dollar every time.", "I have sat down and talked with them about their financial situation. I even offered them all the money I had saved up at the time after around 2-2.5 years of working ($4kish) and they refused even a dollar. They're having a financial distress with not being able to afford a home and instead only being able to rent for the forseeable future.", "My 24 year old son still lives at home. We split bills and it works well for us. We have healthy boundaries and respect each other's privacy.", "I have to disagree about the job market. I run a business and can't get staff. I pay well above award, flexible, cash bonuses and people just don't want to work. \nI have my retired parents helping and turn down work weekly. \nEveryone I know in business is in the same position as me. The work is there, it's just not the work people want.", "I completely understand. However, (and I am not pushing you to do this), if say y'all need to go grocery shopping, have you thought about maybe going before they do and pay for that? Or maybe grab one of the house bills before they do and pay that?\n\nI am in no way trying to force you or talk you into doing any of this. I just threw out a few examples in case you do want to do something. \n\nI can understand trying to save your money for your future.  Like I said, just examples, not something anyone should force you to do.", "Interesting they want to enforce the rule after they know you collected payment.  I still don\u2019t think you owe them anything, they\u2019re behaving badly. Enjoy your money.", "My parents asked for rent from me when I got my first part time job at 17, I was going to college at the same time and used the money for trips, supplies etc\u2026 I paid for my own phone, food and clothes too. \n\nI refused but they really pushed for it when I started to work full time when I was 18\u2026 so I moved out!\nI wasn\u2019t happy paying rent at home when I could use the same to pay to rent somewhere and be independent. \n\nI know it\u2019s very different now and most teenagers can\u2019t afford to do the same, I was just fiercely independent and resented paying to be in the family home when I was still a child really. \n\nIt makes me sad for young people now who can\u2019t afford to move out from their family home until they are a lot older then I was. \nYou are right that it\u2019s very difficult to move into the world and be an adult when you still rely on parents help. \n18 is still so young, I look back and I was working 60 hours a week to pay rent, bills, food etc\u2026\nMy peers were still living with their parents and using money they earned to go out partying and buy clothes. I don\u2019t really know which is best now? The ideal situation would be for it to be affordable for people to move out when they are still young, or live with their parents to save money to buy somewhere without pressure.", "Good point. I got a 21 yo son who consideres himself to be rather successful at being an adult but he still lives under my roof, and the only things he pays for are his car payment, his share of car insurance (he can't afford his own policy) and his credit card.
