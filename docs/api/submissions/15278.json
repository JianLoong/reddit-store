{"id": 15278, "submission_id": "12t92x3", "title": "AITA for wearing a bra instead of a swimsuit/bikini?", "selftext": "I, 18F, screwed up my tanline from wearing regular clothes on campus (i.e. tanktop & shorts). It gave me the worst farmer's tan. So the next day I decided to go out in shorts and a button up cardigan w/ a bra underneath so I could hopefully \"fix\" the tanline. \n\nMy friend, let's call her Amy, decided to tag along with me. We went to a secluded area on campus w/ low foot traffic and I took off the cardigan, revealing my bra to attempt to fix the tan line. If you're wondering why I didn't just go to the beach it's because the nearest one is 7 hours away. \n\nAmy, shocked, asked what I was doing (and I told her beforehand) and now that I had to fix my ugly tanline. Again we were in a low traffic area so no could really see me, which is why I didn't really care. After a minute of this or so Amy just shrugged my behavior off to focus on studying. \n\nI snapped a pic of myself to another friend, we'll call her Elise, and told her to join in on the fun. Furious Elise say's \"it's not funny\" \"how could you be doing that\" and all the other works. \n\nShocked by the negative response I tell Elise that 20 or so guys on the track/cross country team literally run outside all over campus with their shirts off and nipples showing, so why is it a problem when I go to a secluded area, and wear a bra and shorts? \n\nI later talk about this with Amy at lunch and she says what I did was \"indecent\", \"the world doesn't revolve around you so you should be considerate of others\", and that I should've at least wore a bikini top instead. I rebuttalled with the fact that the bra that I was wearing technically covered more of my chest and body than a bikini would and that there's not much difference between the two articles of clothing besides the fact that one is meant to be in the water and the other one isn't. As for \"the world doesn't revolve around you\" comment, I said \"the world doesn't revolve around them either so why should I cater to their feelings about what I'm wearing?\" And as for the \"indecent\" comment, the men on my campus literally jog and run around with a completely exposed chest with nipples showing. So how come it's a problem when I am wearing a bra that covers up more than what they're showing.\n\nMind you, I live in the U.S. and not a country where women's attire are controlled or reinforced, like Iran rn. So imagine my shock when my \"democratic/liberal/semi-feminist\" friends are policing me on what to wear and that \"it's different for the men\" and \"we don't make the rules\", how ironic. \n\nElise was also mentioning to me about how I could \"get kicked out\" for doing that in attempt to stop me, but she apparently had no moral problems w/ consuming marijuana and housing alcohol on campus when there are even stricter and explicit rules against having those items on campus. PLUS she's under the age. Some are saying I am TA for saying this, but i'm mentioning it because she's being hypocritical. She's talking about abiding the \"student guidelines\" (there are no rules on attire) meanwhile she's violating two of them?! Bffr.\n\n(Not to mention at this point I've noticed and personally feel that my friends constantly go out of their way to disagree with me. Is this a sign I should leave them?)\n\nAITA?\n\n\n\nAnswers for commonly asked questions (to avoid my inbox being bombarded with the same one):\n\n1) Elise and Amy weren't bothered by seeing me in my bra just the fact that it was outside.\n\n2) I wasn't attention seeking, which is why I went to a dead area in my campus to do this.\n\n3) Other girls on my campus have also tanned outside on the ground and in more of a public area.\n\n4) I chose my bra over my bikini tops because it covered more and gave me a better tanline. (The bikini tops had underboob)\n\n5) There are NO explicit rules on dress code (except for the gym room) as it's a small college and they honestly don't care what you wear. I couldn't find anything on it in the student handbook, nor have other people I know who wear risque items have been punished or disciplined for it.\n\n6) PSA. NO ONE CAME UP TO ME BECAUSE NO STRANGERS SAW ME AND IF BY CHANCE THEY DID THEY DIDN'T CARE. This was a debate between my friends thinking I would possibly \"offend someone\", in a secluded area which made no sense!\n\n7) My college although private is not conservative!\n\n8) Elise and Amy have seen me butt naked before, they're no stranger to my body. As for the pic, I sent to Elise in a joking/quirky manner to cheer her up since she was in a sour mood before. If I wanted attention I would've posted it on my story :P\n\n9) I also must add that I live in a state where both genders are allowed to go completely topless.\n\n10) Atp I don't care whether you guys think this is \"attention seeking\" so don't bother typing it. The point of the post was to see and judge whether or not my friends are being unreasonable/overreacting, because we always seem to disagree on stupid nonsensical shit and this was my breaking point. Not the fact that \"i want attention\", and for those who keep saying that you sound like an old person who gets none of it anyway, so stop projecting your insecurities on me if that's the main point of what you took away from my post. Had I wanted attention I would've went outside bare naked, and posted it on every platform for all to see, so stop being dense and ignorant.\n\n11) and yes mom's and dad's i wore sunscreen the second time around", "created_utc": 1682012319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12t92x3/aita_for_wearing_a_bra_instead_of_a_swimsuitbikini/", "score": 5116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019d be one thing if your friends were from a culture with strong rules around modesty, but to me they\u2019re being downright silly.", "Eh\u2026 NTA, maybe close to NAH. \n\nI could see how Amy might have been surprised/a bit uncomfortable in the moment. I can be a rule follower and get anxious when others don\u2019t that they\u2019ll/we\u2019ll get in trouble (even if it\u2019s low odds statistically). Maybe Amy was worried someone would see you and it would get reported? Perhaps a bit irrational if it was really low-traffic, but I can give her a pass. Her comment about how \u201cthe world doesn\u2019t revolve around you\u201d seemed a bit harsh for the moment \u2014 have their been other instances in the past?\n\nElise\u2019s reaction definitely seems too harsh.

If you know that she isn\u2019t too prude about these sorts of things typically, than who knows. \n\nIn short, based off this incident in isolation, I think you\u2019re okay. I can think of possible justifications for Amy and Elise\u2019s reactions, but based off this telling alone they seem disproportionate. \n\nAs for the sunscreen comment \u2014 c\u2019mon. People like to tan. We\u2019re all gonna die some day. I wear sunscreen at the beach and the pool and on long hikes. Going to and from class on a college campus? Probably not the norm. A good idea? Sure. But not really relevant here.\n\n**EDIT:** People here need to imagine this with flipped genders. I\u2019m a guy. If I decided to meet up with another male friend to tan and showed up in boxers instead of board shorts, he might still say, \u201chey, that\u2019s a bit odd,\u201d but nobody here would be comparing it to an unsolicited dick pic like some other commenters are saying.

Men and woman both have nipples, so if the nipples aren\u2019t the problem the fat around it instead would have to be? But then again, with bikinis etc. it\u2019s acceptable to show some of the fat but not the nipple.\nIn this case you didn\u2019t even show your breasts but wore a covering bra so I see even less of a problem here. If it\u2019s a bikini top instead wouldn\u2019t have made a difference, plus you made the extra effort to go to a secluded place.", "NTA! Sincerely sorry for these commenters, you don\u2019t come off as attention seeking, and I think your friends might be a bit bored and drama prone.

I don\u2019t know every country\u2019s regulations, but in the US, we only have two sunscreen ingredients (UV filters) that adequately protect in the UVA range: avobenzone and zinc oxide. Zinc is a mineral filter (you might hear it as \u201cphysical\u201d but it\u2019s a misnomer- another rant and more info-dumping I\u2019ll spare know), and it\u2019s known for giving a pretty significant white cast if you use enough (especially on darker skin). Modern zinc sunscreens may use \u201cnano zinc,\u201d which is less white, but on my pale ass skin it gives a slight blue-purple hue that I call a blurple cast (the white cast is because zinc blocks visible light too, so it is reflecting a bit of all wavelengths of light = white light, and nano zinc mainly reflects the blue and purple lights). Avobenzone is not super photostable on its own and, tbh, not super great in my opinion. Countries outside of the US have amazing UVA filters, like Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S, and Tinosorb M.

We north east England \n\nI went to America and I was wearing crop top shorts things like that because the heat there is insanely hot I thought I was gonna die in your heat and humidity and shit I got off other girls was crazy. I never even blinked at a naked girl or woman but you guys actively opened your mouths to shoot me down constantly every park every fair every where. Even adult woman would try shame me. I felt sorry for all their insecurities and me a girl showing my belly could induce such emotions from a stranger adult. I felt pity for them. Like is it a super religious thing like Americans seem to be or just culture. I dunno \n\nYou all walking round in long sleeves top then a T-shirt over it full jeans and hoodies and it\u2019s so hot over there I find it crazy. \n\nI never got over that trip it was in 2005. It was the best trip ever.  I loved the places we saw etc. just every single encounter with a waitress if any woman was filled with dagger\u2019s jealousy or insecurities", "NTA", "NTA lol. People are ridiculous.\n\nOff topic all nipples should be locked up! Ban the nipple!", "NTA your friends are out of line. But you sound like a cool person.", "NTA", "Just use sunscreen next time.", "NTA - My very first thought when starting to read this was 'So what's the difference between a bikini top and a bra?!'. Unless the 'friends are absolute prudes, I can only assume there are certain insecurities, or jealousy at work here.", "NTA what's the difference between a bra and a swim top nothing so it's ok for a woman to wear a small piece of fabric to cover her hooha yet this woman wears a bigger top and yet she gets yelled at. No sorry NTA 50 mom here and my mama bear just went whatever your good ask those friends what the difference is between a bra top and a swim top pretty please.", "I am not going to pass judgement here on your attire; but your future self and dermatologists wants you to know that you are being an AH by trying for a tan. It is going to bite you in the end.", "RIP your DMs", "It took me a minute to get over the ridiculousness of worrying about your tan line, but your argument is solid. Your points are valid. I\u2019ve never understood what makes a bikini much different from a pair of underwear and bra. I mean it\u2019s not like you were wearing a sexy, sheer, see through bra, right? Lots of women\u2019s bra\u2019s show less than today\u2019s bikinis. \n\nNTA", "NTA, they were being weirdly modest about this non-issue.", "Yes. Not sure how true this is but I heard that allowing your young children to be naked on the beach is considered \u2018inappropriate\u2019 in America.", "Let my 4 and 2 year old run naked on a beach during a holiday in the US. Hoo boy\u2026 that was interesting. To appease the locals the kids put on swimming trunks and still had somebody approach us to remind us that the girl (the two year old) needs to cover her breasts.\n\nShe\u2019s two you stupid pervert. What makes it even more depressing: It was a woman\u2026", "You know American christians are just as prudish as muslims right? No need to suddenly put some sort of blame on muslims when they have nothing to do with this. The call is coming from inside the house", "Evangelical States of America", "I think you meant the United States of Christ. The Christian right is the huge danger right now. They're trying to turn this country into Gilead and somehow succeeding even though they're the minority.", "My brother (or sister) in Christ, it sounds like we agree. Maybe the analogy didn\u2019t transfer to you, but I think she\u2019s in the right to tan in a bra. Not sure where you came to the conclusion I said otherwise", "I agree. What OP did wasn't immoral IMO, and it didn't break any laws. If OP's friends are uncomfortable with her being in a bra (especially since they were only uncomfortable that it wasn't a swimsuit), then they are free to not be around her when she is dressed that way. \n\nOP shouldn't go out of her way to make them more comfortable seeing as they have been okay with OP being nude in front of them. \n\nIMO, they're worried about what people would think if they saw OP in a bra.", "If you got tan, you increased your risk for skin cancer.", "So true! My 16 yo daughter gets so fired up over this. She would go debate the principal about how dumb the dress code was, even if it was one of her friends who got \u201cdress coded\u201d, not just for herself.  A lot of her friends would do the same for each other.  It was always about a bra strap showing or shorts that are too short.   Thankfully they have eased up on the dress code rules over the last year or two\u2026 I like to think it\u2019s partially because my daughter and other kids like her have stuck up for themselves and each other!", "I will inform my hsband that he is now to call himself a mature woman because he has more.boob than a 15yo", "I hate people pretending that girls have a choice when they start showing the growth of their boobs. You where punished by those mom's like you could have stopped it growing if you wanted that bad enough. Punishment is for bad behavior, for hurtful things not for growing like nature intended", "Lol, im glad i wasnt at a conservative school. My Mom got yelled ad by my teacher in 4th class because i wore a bra (my mother forced me) and it was obvious to the teacher i wasnt glad with it...\n(Hadnt any boobs at the time, my mother Said i Hit puberty, i have to wear a bra)", "We had the \"note card\" rule. All girls outfits must be a maximum distance of note card between the top of the knee and skirt/shirt and collar bone."]}
