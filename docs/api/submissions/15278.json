{"id": 15278, "submission_id": "12t92x3", "title": "AITA for wearing a bra instead of a swimsuit/bikini?", "selftext": "I, 18F, screwed up my tanline from wearing regular clothes on campus (i.e. tanktop & shorts). It gave me the worst farmer's tan. So the next day I decided to go out in shorts and a button up cardigan w/ a bra underneath so I could hopefully \"fix\" the tanline. \n\nMy friend, let's call her Amy, decided to tag along with me. We went to a secluded area on campus w/ low foot traffic and I took off the cardigan, revealing my bra to attempt to fix the tan line. If you're wondering why I didn't just go to the beach it's because the nearest one is 7 hours away. \n\nAmy, shocked, asked what I was doing (and I told her beforehand) and now that I had to fix my ugly tanline. Again we were in a low traffic area so no could really see me, which is why I didn't really care. After a minute of this or so Amy just shrugged my behavior off to focus on studying. \n\nI snapped a pic of myself to another friend, we'll call her Elise, and told her to join in on the fun. Furious Elise say's \"it's not funny\" \"how could you be doing that\" and all the other works. \n\nShocked by the negative response I tell Elise that 20 or so guys on the track/cross country team literally run outside all over campus with their shirts off and nipples showing, so why is it a problem when I go to a secluded area, and wear a bra and shorts? \n\nI later talk about this with Amy at lunch and she says what I did was \"indecent\", \"the world doesn't revolve around you so you should be considerate of others\", and that I should've at least wore a bikini top instead. I rebuttalled with the fact that the bra that I was wearing technically covered more of my chest and body than a bikini would and that there's not much difference between the two articles of clothing besides the fact that one is meant to be in the water and the other one isn't. As for \"the world doesn't revolve around you\" comment, I said \"the world doesn't revolve around them either so why should I cater to their feelings about what I'm wearing?\" And as for the \"indecent\" comment, the men on my campus literally jog and run around with a completely exposed chest with nipples showing. So how come it's a problem when I am wearing a bra that covers up more than what they're showing.\n\nMind you, I live in the U.S. and not a country that where women's attire are controlled or reinforced. So imagine my shock when my \"democratic/liberal/semi-feminist\" friends are policing me on what to wear and that \"it's different for the men\" and \"we don't make the rules\", how ironic. \n\nElise was also mentioning to me about how I could \"get kicked out\" for doing that in attempt to stop me, but she apparently had no moral problems w/ consuming marijuana and housing alcohol on campus when there are even stricter and explicit rules against having those items on campus. PLUS she's under the age.\n\n(Not to mention at this point I've noticed and personally feel that my friends constantly go out of their way to disagree with me. Is this a sign I should leave them?)\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit update: \n\n1) Elise and Amy weren't bothered by seeing me in my bra just the fact that it was outside.\n\n2) I wasn't attention seeking, which is why I went to a dead area in my campus to do this.\n\n3) Other girls on my campus have also tanned outside on the ground and in more of a public area.\n\n4) I chose my bra over my bikini tops because it covered more and gave me a better tanline.\n\n5) There are NO explicit rules on dress code (except for the gym room) as it's a small college and they honestly don't care what you wear. I couldn't find anything on it in the student handbook, nor have other people I know who wear risque items have been punished or disciplined for it.\n\n6) PSA. NO ONE CAME UP TO ME BECAUSE NO STRANGERS SAW ME AND IF BY CHANCE THEY DID THEY DIDN'T CARE. This was a debate between my friends thinking I would possibly \"offend someone\", in a secluded area which made no sense!\n\n7) My college although private is not conservative!\n\n8) Elise and Amy have seen me butt naked before, they're no stranger to my body. As for the pic, I sent to Elise in a joking/quirky manner to cheer her up since she was in a sour mood before.

It's actually legal in most places for a woman to be completely topless. I used to hang out with a group whose sole purpose was sunbathing topless in Central Park because it's allowed but unfortunately not normalized enough where it's safe to do it alone. Free the nips!!!

It\u2019d be one thing if your friends were from a culture with strong rules around modesty, but to me they\u2019re being downright silly.", "Eh\u2026 NTA, maybe close to NAH. \n\nI could see how Amy might have been surprised/a bit uncomfortable in the moment. I can be a rule follower and get anxious when others don\u2019t that they\u2019ll/we\u2019ll get in trouble (even if it\u2019s low odds statistically). Maybe Amy was worried someone would see you and it would get reported? Perhaps a bit irrational if it was really low-traffic, but I can give her a pass. Her comment about how \u201cthe world doesn\u2019t revolve around you\u201d seemed a bit harsh for the moment \u2014 have their been other instances in the past?\n\nElise\u2019s reaction definitely seems too harsh.

I can think of possible justifications for Amy and Elise\u2019s reactions, but based off this telling alone they seem disproportionate. \n\nAs for the sunscreen comment \u2014 c\u2019mon. People like to tan. We\u2019re all gonna die some day. I wear sunscreen at the beach and the pool and on long hikes. Going to and from class on a college campus? Probably not the norm. A good idea? Sure. But not really relevant here.\n\n**EDIT:** People here need to imagine this with flipped genders. I\u2019m a guy. If I decided to meet up with another male friend to tan and showed up in boxers instead of board shorts, he might still say, \u201chey, that\u2019s a bit odd,\u201d but nobody here would be comparing it to an unsolicited dick pic like some other commenters are saying.

Men and woman both have nipples, so if the nipples aren\u2019t the problem the fat around it instead would have to be? But then again, with bikinis etc. it\u2019s acceptable to show some of the fat but not the nipple.\nIn this case you didn\u2019t even show your breasts but wore a covering bra so I see even less of a problem here.

Sincerely sorry for these commenters, you don\u2019t come off as attention seeking, and I think your friends might be a bit bored and drama prone.

It's not necessarily stated that it's for her bikini. It could just be for wearing crop tops or when naked. Who feels sexy while strutting a farmer's tan? \ud83d\ude02 I don't give a fuck about a farmer's tan, but I'm also older than this girl. She could be insecure about it.", "Yes, she clearly wants attention. That's why she went to a secluded area to sunbathe. Because everyone knows you get more attention when no other people are around, right?\n\nYou seem like you have a whole hell of a lot of growing up to do.", "Okay you have to know that tanning beds are waaaaayyyyy worse then a natural tan. You can get skin cancer from both sure, you\u2019re far more likely to get it from a tanning bed.", "Yeah but I never go out and I need vitamin d anyway in attempt to avoid osteoporosis. Plus tanning beds cause skin cancer at higher and faster rates than being out in the sun.", "My cuban family would definitely have a problem with my sister if they knew she was walking around outside with just her bra on. \n\nThe comment above about Hispanic countries probably being more used to seeing breasts because of breasts feeding is not entirely true. I've never seen any of my aunts/cousin expose their breasts in public. I can understand that's just my experience but no one I know of thinks it's normal. It sucks and it's double standards. True gender equality will be hard to achieve but we still need to try. \n\nOh, NTA though. Your friends suck a bit :/", "I have to ask.. how is a bra tan line better than a bikini one? I say this even with your huge edit.\n\nIf you're out in the pool, you'll be in a bikini, and you'll have the weird bra tan line instead. It just doesn't make sense to me.", "NTA but why do it with your conservative friends around I think this is more awareness of who and where you are doing these things.  I wouldn\u2019t think anyone would do it if it were nearby a church but in a secluded area for example", "Breasts are not sexual. Just like how the human body isn\u2019t inherently sexual. Many countries it is legal for women to be topless the same as men.", "Stop making boobs sexual in every situation, k thanks", "You seem miserable", "I agree on your view of breasts. Men\u2019s and women\u2019s nipples are not equal and you will never convince me they are until a man can achieve orgasm from their nipple being played with.", "I don't need to. I just needed to point out that it was a silly argument to have to cover up because *somebody else* might become aroused. Using feet highlighted the ridiculousness of the request.", "If they are your friends you shouldn\u2019t have to censor yourself or your thoughts from them.\n\nYou say \u201cafter seeing how they reacted I probably wont do it again\u201d real friends will support your choices as you\u2019re an adult and have your own thoughts.\n\nIf this is something they are willing to fight and possibly unfriend you over, than they clearly don\u2019t actually like \u201cyou\u201d but instead their perception of you. You\u2019re breaking their perception of you, and that upsets them. \n\nDon\u2019t change what you\u2019re doing. Be yourself and the right people will follow, even if it means you lose others :) being yourself is so unique and the best thing you could ever do for your happiness and your self esteem in the long run.", "Some people have selective morals, who knows? I can see why you would think that. Y\u2019all are young, and still figuring things out. I\u2019m sure this will likely blow over and become a joke of sorts.", "Definitely NTA then considering your friends knew what your plan was.", "[deleted]", "If it\u2019s just to fix tan lines on a one-off basis, I don\u2019t see the risk as being all that elevated.", "This isn't true, it's the same UV radiation from both of them. It's all about how long you expose yourself to it in either situation", "Well, you can supplement Vitamin D. I do that every day. And if it\u2019s just to correct the tan lines, that short bit of tanning shouldn\u2019t make a difference. I agree that a bra often any more revealing than a bikini top, depending on the bra.\n\nPersonally, I think you\u2019re NTA, and I couldn\u2019t care less if you are wearing your bra outside, and I think your friends are being ridiculous and judgy. My only quibble is that you say this is about fixing tan lines, not about regularly laying out in the sun. That could be managed quickly and easily in other ways - this isn\u2019t for your all-the-time color, it\u2019s for a repair. So the vitamin D and increased cancer risks really shouldn\u2019t be the reasoning here.", "I have a formal coming up and the bra I wore to tan in is the one I'm going to wear with my formal dress. And if I wore a bikini instead the bikini's tanline would show through the formal dress. Which is what I was trying to avoid, hope that makes sense.", "They seem to have reasonable standards you mean?", "I think the number of men who can orgasm from *just* nipple play has gotta be close to the number of women who can. The clit is pretty damn important for most of us.\n\nObviously they aren't completely equal. Only one of them can make food. But that doesn't make a shirtless man inherently less sexy than a shirtless woman.", "type it in to google and you\u2019ll see your wrong by that one point. i typed it into google, here\u2019s what i found. \n\n\u201cThe biggest reason why there is so little mention of the male nipple orgasm is because of the excessive focus on the penis.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe sensitivity of a person's nipples is very individual, regardless of a person's sex. Both men and women may have nipples that are incredibly sensitive or that have no erotic response whatsoever. This gender similarity is due to the fact that the nipples of both men and women are surrounded by smooth muscle fibers that cause them to become erect, like when aroused or cold. When stimulated, they fill with blood, becoming even more sensitive for some people.\u201d\n\none google search and as you can see a persons sex doesn\u2019t have much to do with it at all. someone women aren\u2019t sexually aroused by nipple play. some men are. now you can view the all nipples in the same way :) \n\nhere\u2019s the link btw: https://www.bingedaily.in/article/it-s-true-men-can-have-real-nipple-orgasms (one of many articles)", "Except your argument doesn't hold up at all when probably ~99% of straight dudes are attracted to breasts and a very very very small portion of those dudes are attracted to feet. It's not the same at all.", "Do you have friends? \n\nFriends send selfies to one another all the god damned time.", "Right, but unless you\u2019re in the sun literally all day everyday, you aren\u2019t going to get the same UV concentration as you would with a tanning bed habit. 15mins in a tanning bed is equivalent to 3hrs in direct sunlight.", "It does. Thank you for clearing that up!", "Interesting", "So what you are proposing is that people cover up body parts based on a specific number percent of the population that might be attracted to it? Sounds very silly to me, but it's your proposal, so maybe if you defined it, it would be easier for people to understand. \n\n\n0-5% - don't cover \n\n6-10% - ? \n\n11-15% - ? \n\n16-20% - ?\n\n20-25% - ?\n\n26-30% - ?\n\n30%+ - cover (per comment you deleted)", "No it's called using common sense. Not everything has to be broken down into specific scientific terms and conditions to make sense. If you don't want people making comments about how you should cover up more then cover up more, it's that simple. Change yourself before asking the entire world to change for you.", "Oh, I was arguing your comment *wasn't* common sense, but you presented a quantitative rebuttal that people didn't need to cover their feet because 30% of people are attracted to female breasts whereas only a smaller % of the population had a foot fetish. \n\nI'm simply asking you to define the terms you presented for this interesting new quantitative approach.", "And I'm saying the terms don't need to be explicitly defined because it should be obvious to anyone that interacts with society. I don't really understand what you're getting at here, it seems like you just want to be difficult which is why you're blatantly ignoring my point and acting superior, that being said this will be my final comment on this thread because I can't stand the way you speak. If you still don't understand what I'm trying to say then I have no reason to talk to you because you are just intentionally acting ignorant. Bye."]}
