{"id": 15278, "submission_id": "12t92x3", "title": "AITA for wearing a bra instead of a swimsuit/bikini?", "selftext": "I, 18F, screwed up my tanline from wearing regular clothes on campus (i.e. tanktop & shorts). It gave me the worst farmer's tan. So the next day I decided to go out in shorts and a button up cardigan w/ a bra underneath so I could hopefully \"fix\" the tanline. \n\nMy friend, let's call her Amy, decided to tag along with me. We went to a secluded area on campus w/ low foot traffic and I took off the cardigan, revealing my bra to attempt to fix the tan line. If you're wondering why I didn't just go to the beach it's because the nearest one is 7 hours away. \n\nAmy, shocked, asked what I was doing (and I told her beforehand) and now that I had to fix my ugly tanline. Again we were in a low traffic area so no could really see me, which is why I didn't really care. After a minute of this or so Amy just shrugged my behavior off to focus on studying. \n\nI snapped a pic of myself to another friend, we'll call her Elise, and told her to join in on the fun. Furious Elise say's \"it's not funny\" \"how could you be doing that\" and all the other works. \n\nShocked by the negative response I tell Elise that 20 or so guys on the track/cross country team literally run outside all over campus with their shirts off and nipples showing, so why is it a problem when I go to a secluded area, and wear a bra and shorts? \n\nI later talk about this with Amy at lunch and she says what I did was \"indecent\", \"the world doesn't revolve around you so you should be considerate of others\", and that I should've at least wore a bikini top instead. I rebuttalled with the fact that the bra that I was wearing technically covered more of my chest and body than a bikini would and that there's not much difference between the two articles of clothing besides the fact that one is meant to be in the water and the other one isn't. As for \"the world doesn't revolve around you\" comment, I said \"the world doesn't revolve around them either so why should I cater to their feelings about what I'm wearing?\" And as for the \"indecent\" comment, the men on my campus literally jog and run around with a completely exposed chest with nipples showing. So how come it's a problem when I am wearing a bra that covers up more than what they're showing.\n\nMind you, I live in the U.S. and not a country that where women's attire are controlled or reinforced. So imagine my shock when my \"democratic/liberal/semi-feminist\" friends are policing me on what to wear and that \"it's different for the men\" and \"we don't make the rules\", how ironic. \n\nElise was also mentioning to me about how I could \"get kicked out\" for doing that in attempt to stop me, but she apparently had no moral problems w/ consuming marijuana and housing alcohol on campus when there are even stricter and explicit rules against having those items on campus. PLUS she's under the age. Some are saying I am TA for saying this, but i'm mentioning it because she's being hypocritical. She's talking about abiding the \"student guidelines\" (there are no rules on attire) meanwhile she's violating two of them?! Bffr.\n\n(Not to mention at this point I've noticed and personally feel that my friends constantly go out of their way to disagree with me. Is this a sign I should leave them?)\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit update: \n\n1) Elise and Amy weren't bothered by seeing me in my bra just the fact that it was outside.\n\n2) I wasn't attention seeking, which is why I went to a dead area in my campus to do this.\n\n3) Other girls on my campus have also tanned outside on the ground and in more of a public area.\n\n4) I chose my bra over my bikini tops because it covered more and gave me a better tanline.\n\n5) There are NO explicit rules on dress code (except for the gym room) as it's a small college and they honestly don't care what you wear. I couldn't find anything on it in the student handbook, nor have other people I know who wear risque items have been punished or disciplined for it.\n\n6) PSA. NO ONE CAME UP TO ME BECAUSE NO STRANGERS SAW ME AND IF BY CHANCE THEY DID THEY DIDN'T CARE. This was a debate between my friends thinking I would possibly \"offend someone\", in a secluded area which made no sense!\n\n7) My college although private is not conservative!\n\n8) Elise and Amy have seen me butt naked before, they're no stranger to my body. As for the pic, I sent to Elise in a joking/quirky manner to cheer her up since she was in a sour mood before.

I can be a rule follower and get anxious when others don\u2019t that they\u2019ll/we\u2019ll get in trouble (even if it\u2019s low odds statistically). Maybe Amy was worried someone would see you and it would get reported? Perhaps a bit irrational if it was really low-traffic, but I can give her a pass.

Sure. But not really relevant here.\n\n**EDIT:** People here need to imagine this with flipped genders. I\u2019m a guy.

Men and woman both have nipples, so if the nipples aren\u2019t the problem the fat around it instead would have to be? But then again, with bikinis etc. it\u2019s acceptable to show some of the fat but not the nipple.\nIn this case you didn\u2019t even show your breasts but wore a covering bra so I see even less of a problem here.
