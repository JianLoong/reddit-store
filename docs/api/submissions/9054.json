Unfortunately, your dad does not look at you as a son but as a money tree.  His wife is even worse. I'd be willing to bet that the money you send for your siblings isn't even used for them.  I'm gonna tell you to stop sending that money and instead, start putting it into a savings account that your half siblings can have when they are adults and can't have their money stolen by their miserable parents.\n\n If your dad and his wife cut ties with you over this, then you know for sure that it was never about a relationship, and it was always about the money.", "Honest to God, I\u2019d stop sending anything.

He and his wife need to create more ways to increase their income. You are gracious to send money monthly to curb the affects of poverty. \n\nHim going ballistic is not acceptable. Why is he so convicted to invest in these kids when he provided very little financial support to you as a minor?", "NTA\n\nYou already send them $6000 a year that you don't have to send.

This is up to Todd and Beth.\n\nLater in life, if you have a crapload of money, you can help them out more generously.", "NTA. Those kids are not your responsibility. If their mother wants them in school she needs to get a job and send them.
