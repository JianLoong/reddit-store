Which is awful. You can't neglect a kid because their Dad didn't take the time to realise he hated a woman before having a baby with her. Your Dad used you as an excuse, successfully pitting you two against each other forever.\n\nSo Skylar isn't reading into anything. She was told repeatedly her Dad and his family were there for you because they loved you more. Not being included in Grandma's will, not being helped financially by her Dad, her Dad being absent in her life while present in yours. How do you expect Skylar to know her Dad is an abusive manipulative monster when he's never been around her for long? Sounds like she invited you into her therapy because she's trying very hard to make peace with being rejected by her Dad and his family while having a sister who's received the acceptance she's dreamed of. \n\nI think if you went to therapy, it would be the perfect place for you to explain that from your POV, not having him in your life is the blessing because he's a monster. But at the very least, Skylar deserves some empathy from you. Your Dad might be awful. But Skylar was still the kid waiting on the steps for her Dad to pick her up, and he never did.

I'd be really surprised if the session ended up being an hour long free for all for the sibling. Considering how OP presents this, you need to read between the lines. To me it sounds like the sibling wants to become closer with OP but that she needs some kind of acknowledgement from OP that she's been mistreated to do that. The point of doing it with a therapist is that OP would also have the chance to express their feelings and that there is a trained third party that can facilitate the conversation.", "The post has been edited. It initially came off as OP calling her sister an emotionally crippled cretin. I quoted directly from the original post.", "I didn't misunderstand anything.

My grandmother? Maybe, but she didn\u2019t really know Skylar. \n\nCertainly not by my father, who is psychologically abusive and damaging to everyone who has the misfortune to know him. Just because I saw him more often than Skylar doesn\u2019t mean I had any better experience of him as a father. \n\nAnd where in any of that have I treated Skylar any type of way? Honestly, besides her constantly being mean to me any time I saw her when we were kids, I don\u2019t really know her. I see her at family weddings and stuff. I\u2019m not rude to her. She likes to trauma dump to our relatives and tries to bring me into it and I quietly leave the conversation. That\u2019s the extent of me interacting with her.", "I am accountable for being born? Or for being treated how I was by my father (which wasn\u2019t well, mind you), something in which I had no choice? I\u2019m accountable for how I treat others, not how they treat me. \n\nHer life was made worse by me, fine. What was I meant to do about that?", "Because I thought her asking me for help given how she\u2019s always always treated me was a little bit ironic. But again, I shouldn\u2019t have actually laughed, I own that.", "You don\u2019t get to expect other people to come to therapy to \u201cacknowledge\u201d your supposed mistreatment. Even if there was a problem with favouritism, that wouldn\u2019t be on OP to acknowledge to make her feel better.\n\nOp has better ways to spend her time then trying to validate the way someone who she is hardly involved with feels. If she wanted to be closer she\u2019s ask OP to go for a coffee or something, not expect her to \u201cacknowledge\u201d her at a therapy session", "No. I. Didn\u2019t. I missed a couple of words in the post and I\u2019ve now edited. My FATHER is an emotionally crippled cretin who has driven two of his wives to mental breakdowns. He\u2019s a genuinely noxious individual. That\u2019s a fact.", "No, she called her father an emotionally crippled cretin, not her sister.", "\u201cVibes\u201d don\u2019t mean anything, what has she actually done wrong", "That's not quite how it works... If you were favored and Skylar has feelings about it that are directed at you, part of the therapist's job is to redirect and focus those feelings where they should be, which is at her parents.  Not saying you have to be involved, at all, but correcting a perception is not the same as invalidating an emotion.  \n\nFrom what you're saying Skylar is bitter and angry and directing that frustration at you.  You did not choose to be born, you did not choose for your dad to cut her off, you made no choices.  If she is perceiving you as the perpetrator or villain, that is incorrect and should be addressed with/by the therapist that you were also a child and had no say in any adult decisions that were happening at the time.", "Whose choice was it for Skylar not to have a relationship with your grandmother?", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to go to her therapy session but it sounds like what she needs to understand is that your dad sucks. That he sucked for you and sucked for her. Not your fault, not hers. You don\u2019t have to be the one to tell her that but seems like she is projecting all the crap that happened on to you instead of him.", "All of what you said is valid. I see it not being beneficial attending, but also beneficial to set the record straight. It appears that you yourself experienced trauma and still harbor anger and emotionally distance yourself from the trauma. As someone who harbored those same emotions for 20 years, therapy in general might do you good. It might even serve you better to go to the session(s) with Skyler because she is also a point of strife for you. Even to no end other than sharing your perspective to Skyler. Using your voice and unpacking can make a world of difference.", "You're accountable for your own behavior towards you sister, and it's evident through your replies that you don't think she deserves your empathy, which is frankly fucked up when you yourself can acknowledge that your father did a number on both of you. Take accountability for the fact that you HAVE received preferential treatment from family and your own father and that might have impacted how your sister views you.", "I agreed with everything you said up until \"ask OP to go for a coffee or something\". It's pretty obvious from this post that they are not at a point in their relationship where they can hang out in that way. They probably do need therapy in order to have a normal relationship. So if that is what her sibling is seeking, this is a responsible avenue to pursue. Whether OP wants that or not is up to her and if she doesn't I agree that doesn't make her an AH.", "Thanks for providing that context, it actually does change my opinion. I still think the right thing to do here would be to go to the therapy session because I think that would be a real opportunity for you to talk about *your* feelings toward your sister as well. It could be healing for both of you. However I don't agree with your friends that it doesn't cost you anything. It costs you a lot emotionally. So ultimately that call is up to you.\n\nNTA.", "OK, my bad, OP missed a few words there in her original post and it came off as her calling her sibling that.", "You don\u2019t seem to understand. She has no responsibility or control over Skylar\u2019s feelings and she doesn\u2019t want to be involved. Someone else\u2019s issues have nothing to do with her. She\u2019s absolutely correct to not want to be dragged into this.", "She said she doesn't want to. It is not her responsibility, stop trying to convince her", "Okay, fair enough that\u2019s your opinion, can\u2019t argue it.", "And I'm not suggesting that she should be.  I'm simply pointing out a general misconception she is labouring under. In fact I specifically said I wasn't suggesting she be involved.\n\nUnless I deleted that line in which case, consider it added."]}
