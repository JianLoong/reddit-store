Which is awful. You can't neglect a kid because their Dad didn't take the time to realise he hated a woman before having a baby with her. Your Dad used you as an excuse, successfully pitting you two against each other forever.\n\nSo Skylar isn't reading into anything. She was told repeatedly her Dad and his family were there for you because they loved you more. Not being included in Grandma's will, not being helped financially by her Dad, her Dad being absent in her life while present in yours. How do you expect Skylar to know her Dad is an abusive manipulative monster when he's never been around her for long? Sounds like she invited you into her therapy because she's trying very hard to make peace with being rejected by her Dad and his family while having a sister who's received the acceptance she's dreamed of. \n\nI think if you went to therapy, it would be the perfect place for you to explain that from your POV, not having him in your life is the blessing because he's a monster. But at the very least, Skylar deserves some empathy from you. Your Dad might be awful. But Skylar was still the kid waiting on the steps for her Dad to pick her up, and he never did.

She may be displacing her feelings of betrayal and anger onto you, but honestly your callous disregard for her experience and even knowing your own father was \"an emotionally crippled cretin\" isn't enough to convince you there was some severe damage done and have even an ounce of compassion for her because of it.  It sounds like the apple doesn't fall far from the tree with you either.  \n\nAnd you know what, your being there and getting your point of view out there may actually correct some assumptions she has about how you grew up and the kind of experience you had with him too. Especially if it wasn't a bed of roses.", "you're an AH\n if you had her life you would have felt the same way. hard watching somebody have the life you feel you are equally entitled to. Sounds like she's trying to move past it... you're an asshole for not helping. She's your sister", "You don't have to go, but the fact that you've fooled yourself into thinking that none of this has anything to do with you is laughable. You certainly talk about her like you're the golden child. Even the username you picked for this post is insulting her.", "NTA. Therapy only works if one attends it voluntarily. It's not a command performance where you are held hostage or as a result of emotional blackmail. Attending therapy under those conditions may do more harm than good.\n\nSo you have every right to refuse to go anywhere you don't want to be.\n\nYour half-sister's feelings are for her to resolve. As you write, we are in charge of ourselves. Yes, circumstances may be against us at certain points in life, but overall we are still responsible as to how we, individually, respond to those circumstances.\n\nDon't take on problems you don't have.", "You are NTA, Op. She just wants to use you as a therapy punching bag. You made the right choice.", "Why on earth would anyone choose to volunteer to go get beat up? She sounds like a crybaby. Grow the F up and stop blaming others for your horrible life.\nCall a wambulance.", "I like you, I've been reading your responses. Sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and made the best judgement call. So, NTA for not retriggering your own trauma or turning into a rug for Skyler to walk all over. But, maybe a tiny AH for how you told her no.", "NTA. She has a lot of issues she needs to work through and I don\u2019t think it will be productive for you to be there for her and the therapist to use you as a human punching bag. \n\nIf anything I think it would just cause your mental health to decline massively.", "NTA. I'm coming at this from the perspective of having a sibling I have no relationship with, although we share shitty parents. I think it's hard for people to understand what having no relationship to someone you're related to is like.\n\nOn top of barely being acquaintances, your only interactions have involved you being insulted. You as a child had no control over the adults' actions. But more pertinently, you don't talk! You don't interact! You haven't had and currently don't have a relationship! \n\nSure you didn't have to laugh, but you got a random call from a stranger who is usually mean to you. And were asked to abruptly involve yourself in a very personal, intimate emotional situation. I don't think she was going to be receptive to \"I'm sorry but I'm not comfortable with that\" either. \n\nYou might give yourself the gift of blocking her.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you don\u2019t have much of a relationship, and personally I think it\u2019s gross to use someone as a prop for your own therapy.", "As a fellow resented younger half sister, NTA big time. My half sister can feel however she wants about how my existence negatively impacts her life, but it has nothing to do with me. Same here, her issue is with your dad's actions.\n\nBlaming you for your dad's actions because there\u2019s a chance you were his reason for some decisions is like blaming an overgrown lawn for your decision to spend your Saturday mowing. Like yeah your lawn is overgrown and that\u2019s why you made the decision but like\u2026 the lawn had zero say in that decision making. Same as you. Especially when you didn\u2019t live in the same house", "NTA. Just move on.", "It costs you nothing to go?! I\u2019d think having someone complain about you in front of their therapist and you would be frustrating to listen to. Not to mention having to deal with all that hostility. Why should you be your half-sister\u2019s emotional punching bag?

Obviously not, as she has been doing just this for a while!  What she probably wants is to blame you directly, with the therplists approval and agreement, and for you to realize how you are responsible for all of her unhappiness. And for you to abjectly apologise. \nWhich is not going to happen, so there is no reason for you to be subjected to her complaining and blaming. NTA", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nPeople like this are already well aware of their own faults. They are also well aware the blame they place on others is either made up or projected. All they are looking for is a inch. Because once you give them soenthing small, there behaviors of \"complain and beg till I get what I want\" is reinforced.\n\nAnd that's all the want. They want, what ever current fantasy they have, to always be what they want.", "NTA for saying no, you're always allowed to say no, but YTA for laughing in her face when she was being very vulnerable with you. I think you've done more harm than good here for you both, and your relationship", "There's 0 reason for you to go. I would just block her.", "NTA\n\nThe problem with your friends is they're treating like you going there will allow your sister to \"vent her frustrations\" into the void effectively. First and foremost it's a time cost to someone who only shares a blood connection to you, and has made it your bane to acknowledge that at every turn. Secondly, it is actually a psychological blow to be someone's whipping boy for an hour while they say that everything in their life that has gone wrong from daddy not staying with their mom to stubbing their toe last night is your fault. Even if someone knows at the surface that it's not true, it's still distressing to go through it. Also, frankly it's just an unhealthy ask.\n\nThis girl is twenty-five years old and at some point you have to accept that you play with the hand you're dealt and try to make something of your life. Instead, she's blaming OP for why she's spinning her wheels.", "NTA as someone with a toxic sister like this, I commend you and love that you said it would be boring. You live your life and let her figure out her self-pity/victim mindset with her therapist", "NTA. Her therapy needs to be about her, nit her blaming you.", "NTA for not participating, but WOW you were a dick about it.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t deserve to lose *hours* of your life due to some half relative who hates you, wanting to use you to improve themselves. \n\nIt won\u2019t just be an hour. The shit she\u2019ll pull will live rent free in your head for a while afterwards. Not worth it imo. \n\nIt\u2019s great she\u2019s working through her problems. But she should send you a \u201csorry I\u2019ve tried to guilt and shit on you as a punching bag for my issues for years.\u201d Not a \u201chey I\u2019ve told my therapist you\u2019re the reason why I suffer. Come to a session and hear why\u201d\n\n\n\nI\u2019d scale back on talking to the friends who gave you shit about it - those aren\u2019t people that have your best interests in mind. There\u2019s a very strong, extremely oppressive social movement that therapy is mandatory and anything talking against it on any level is evil. Unfortunately you\u2019re going to get shit on by a lot of people for making a decision that prioritizes *your* mental health first.", "NTA. I think a lot of families are messed up, which is really sad, but I believe a child owes nothing to anyone. I would love to see you keep focussing on living a healthy life for you, which you seem to be doing. Being dragged into the trauma will not help anything for you.", "That would be unethical of the therapist unless OP goes  himself. A good therapist won't take everything at face value but they work with what they are given because you have to work from where the client is at. Not where you think they should be. Talking to people involved without being a client in an agreed shared space is against best practices and accomplishes nothing.", "Mine did, back when I had one. And that was as an adult - while I was still a minor, *every single one* of them wanted to do at least one session with my abuser, if they didn't just go around me and tell them everything I had said altogether. Then they wondered why I stopped telling them stuff.\n\nI have also heard of therapists trying to convert a client into Christianity, and one case of one trying to play matchmaker between the client and a guy she wasn't interested in. \n\nThere are a lot of shitty therapists out there, unfortunately. The good ones are worth their weight in gold, but to get to them, it can be quite an odyssee.", "It also costs emotional energy. Even if you know someone doesn't like you or is mad at you, it's still taxing and sometimes sad or frightening or stressful to have to sit for an hour to listen to them tell you all the things they don't like about you, or argue with them about why they're mad at you. OP doesn't have to subject herself to that, especially since no one is offering her any kind of aftercare to make sure she's okay after putting herself through that.", "Not really. It was from the grandmother, who barely knew Skylar. That's less favoritism and more getting money from somebody you were actually close to over someone who barely knew her.", "I like this answer the best.", "She had to make her peace with who he is because **he abused her**, supergenius.", "For refusing to go to a therapy session?", "Block her from being able to contact you directly.", "Agree and NTA", "NTA \n\nBlock her", "And none of that is OP's fault.", "A therapist needs a masters degree which means graduate training in psychology. You\u2019re thinking of a counsellor which still requires at least a diploma.\n\nThe terms get confusing because people use the same terms for people at all levels and some countries will use them differently.", "I think tact is always appropriate.  The girl is in therapy, at least she's trying.  That's more than I can say for most assholes.", "You may not be the reason your life was better than hers but you seem adamant to not even recognize your own privilege. Ignorant people often have done more harm then they realize.", "Your intent and reasoning don't actually matter. You laughed. She's likely taking it at face value as people do.", "Unless Skylar gave the therapist permission to speak to OP (which she might not outside the bounds of a family therapy session) then would the therapist even be able to speak to her?", "That doesn't mean jack, especially when that person happens to have spent the OP's entire life blaming her for her own problems.", "Agree. Both parents have fed into this narrative that sis has, it didn't come out of nowhere. It would be nice if op would give her some grace as she doesn't have any good parents and had a difficult upbringing. Inheriting less was probably a brutal nail in the coffin, too.", "She wants to vent her feelings on OP and get OP to admit she was the \"golden child\". She will give tons of examples but what she doesn't have is the knowledge of what *actually* happened, not how she perceived it. Her perception is her problem that you can't solve for her. I'm sure she's not willing to hear all the ways you weren't favored. \n\nShe is also jealous of things that aren't your fault. If you were the golden child, you didn't do it, your parents did, but she's projecting her anger on you. She's also jealous of an inheritance that had nothing to do with her. I can understand it a bit but she's added that to the reasons she hates you. You can't change that for her.\n\nI don't see any benefit to you to let her vent and accuse you of things. She needs to work on her reaction to it and the fact that you were a child and had no control either. NTA", "In family or group therapy, all of the participants are patients of the mental health provider. It is unethical for a mental health provider to rope in someone the provider does not know, who may themselves be mentally fragile or volatile, and bring them in as some kind of special guest star solely for the benefit of the provider's patient. You simply can't use people as treatment tools like that.", "I wonder if OP's father weaponized \"how much better\" she had it than her older sister to make her feel guilty for wanting more too and now she resents hearing it. maybe she doesn't actually feel like her life is good and feels like her experience of her shitty father is being denied when she's told that she got to good end of the deal. \n\nShe seems to acknowledge he was also a shit father to her - maybe they could bond over that and start there.", "I suspect this is why the therapist has suggested to Skylar for OP to come to a session. Because they want Skyler to confront the reality that OP isn\u2019t to blame for any sense of favouritism.\n\nI suspect OP that you\u2019d benefit from the session as well because a therapist would not allow Skylar to blame you for her feelings. It could actually help both of you deal with the past.\n\nAt worst it\u2019ll be an hour of you and the therapist trying to show her that she needs to redirect that anger and you can then leave it at that.\n\nHaving said all that NAH - you are not obliged to attend and it\u2019s not your problem to solve.", "First see needs to see that her pov was incorrect, which *might actually happen if op were to cooperate with her by going to therapy, and then she may want to make amends.", "Your therapist asking you to invite in your half sibling for a session is how you initiate family therapy from a one on one. \n\nYes OP has expressed that she doesn\u2019t feel her sister is \u201cfamily\u201d what\u2019s your point? That the therapist should know that? The sister is clearly an unreliable narrator/processing trauma and neglect. She sees OP as family.
