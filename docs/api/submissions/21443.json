On the way home I had a 90 minute layover in Philly. When passengers are allowed to stand on the plane I am prepared with my bag and walk as far forward as I can rather than waiting for all passengers ahead of me to de-plane. AITA?\n\nThe full post\nWhen I fly, I never pay more than the most basic economy ticket because in my opinion/budget its an unnecessary expense; that said, paying $200 dollars extra for forward seats wouldn\u2019t inhibit my ability to travel altogether.\n\nAny other flight with a longer layover would have been cost prohibitive, so it was this connection or I couldn\u2019t go. After the plane had completed taxi and passengers were allowed to stand, I immediately stood and moved as far forward to de-plane as I could. I was assigned random seating by the airline in the dead last row of a Boeing 737, and I was concerned I wouldn\u2019t make my connection.\n\nAs I did this, a guy in one of the aisles commented that everyone on the plane was in a hurry, to which I said \u201cthe only people in a hurry are the ones hurrying\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen I leave planes, I never sprint or shove people. I do power walk, pass people in large walkways, ask them to stand on the right on people-movers so I can walk on the left, things like that which put me in the front of the border control and security lines. In my mind, being in the aisle when the plane unloads is similar to these other behaviors. However this guy on the plane (and some of my friends I\u2019ve told this story to) are of the opinion that it is a line, and I cut the line.\n\nI have been on flights where those few minutes made the difference between making and missing a connection. Unlike the boarding process there\u2019s no explicit order to de-plane, but is it meant to be assumed? AITA for moving forward down the aisle?\n\nEdit answering some common questions\n\n1. No I did not ask people already in the aisle to move\n\n2. I advanced at most 7 rows, truthfully cannot remember the exact amount\n\n3. 90 minute layover means 50-60 minutes until boarding for the next flight begins and 80 before they close the doors to the aircraft\n\n4.

No one complains about this if it\u2019s communicated. \n\n2) Slow / inexperienced travellers are the bane of airports everywhere. Not moving over on the walkway. Not ready for security inspection.

The only circumstance in which you should \"cut the line\" is if the line is moving and they're still just sitting in their seat waiting for something, in which case it's perfectly fine to go ahead of them - because you would actually go somewhere. In this case you were just standing and waiting and didn't save any meaningful time.\n\nAlso, if your travel anxiety is such that you feel the need to rush off the plane for a 90 minute layover, then you are dead wrong about paying for better seats being an \"unnecessary expense.\"", "INFO: A 90-minute layover but you were hurrying?

Airlines also suck because there should be no such thing as a short layover unless you are in a tiny airport. Any layover less than a hour shouldn't be bookable because the likelihood that you'll miss it is huge. It takes the plane at least 30 minutes to taxi to the terminal and have everyone deboard and then you might be running to customs or to another terminal.\n\nI don't really sympathize with your time crunch situation because you did choose a flight with a short layover but there is no rule that says you can't move forward until everyone in front of you does, so I don't think you did anything wrong.", "Yta\n\nPlanes deboard front to back, not ah's that feel they are more important, then front to back.

However, your experience isn't the norm in my experience. I've also had the same thing (no announcement from the crew about connecting flights) happen when I was going to miss my connecting flight and they didn't ask the passengers to sit down and let us through.", "I travel for work and have seen it all the time. The bummer is when everyone has a tight connection because of some delay.", "I have. I've requested this very thing multiple times mid flight and they did the announcement and asked people to keep their seats so those of us with connection flights could make it in time.", "Maybe I've just traveled a lot more.", "This is a very good point. \u201cCutting in front of people\u201d is maybe slightly rude\u2026\n\nBut holding 50-100 people behind you hostage to your unawareness is over-the-top rude.", "Thanks for sharing that. It's interesting and also makes a lot of sense.", "And? How is that anyone else\u2019s problem?", "I see now they had to go through customs and border control. They should have planned appropriately and sucked it up and had a longer layover, even though it cost more.", "Sometimes, if the flight crew know there are passengers with tight connections, they'll instruct the rest of the passengers to let those people get off first.", "I was in flight couple of months ago and they did exactly that, announced need to let passengers off first for connecting flight- so it is definitely not abnormal to do this", "I\u2019ve flown maybe six or seven lines and heard that announcement. They even did that for a random group of five of us during a short layover in Minneapolis due to weather. Airline had one of those carts for us to get to the gate. Still missed it by five minutes and they put us up in a hotel and off on the first flight in the morning", "It\u2019s technically not, but this is a really selfish and narcissistic attitude to take. You can afford others grace in air travel, which is some of the most stressful forms of transportation. So yes, while that\u2019s not technically anyone\u2019s problem, if everyone had this attitude about everything we\u2019d just be animals without ordered society.", "I didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t offer grace but I\u2019m also often in a hurry for various reasons. I would never EXPECT someone to let me in front of them. If we were delayed for any reason, and they announced people with connecting flights need to get off first, I would stay seated until they got off. I don\u2019t think someone who doesn\u2019t plan their trip accordingly deserves to cut everyone in line.", "That is also true. A very fair point\u2026"]}
