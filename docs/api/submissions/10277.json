Its your kid. You are responsible for her health and safety, and if you feel she isnt safe with your brother its literally your duty as a parent to protect her.", "NTA. Babies can\u2019t set their own physical boundaries, so parents have to do it for them. Tell him to stop touching her if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with it. Maybe you could show him what touching is ok, like gently and appropriately holding her, but not touching her face. If he keeps overstepping the boundary you set, you could implement a no-touching rule and he can just interact with her by smiling, talking, waving etc.", "Absolutely NTA. Tell him to chill, he's your brother, not some rando", "NTA but speak up.\n\nYou can tell anyone who touches your child to wash their hands first.\n\nYou can guide/educate him on how to handle a baby by critiquing him.\n\nIt doesn't sound like the baby is bothered by him so if you require him to wash his hands before touching her you'll feel better about the interaction.", "NTA He is twelve and should know better", "It all depends on how you approach the issue.\n\nIf you tell him: *leave her alone because you are dirty and harassing my child*, you would be TA.\n\nFirst, you and your wife need to be on the same page and show united front.\n\nSecond, your brother is not a baby. Talk to him and your parents. Discuss the importance of hygiene and respecting personal space. Tell them that you (and your wife) are prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of your baby who is still developing her immune system and needs to feel loved and safe.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He's 12 and he may not understand your concern and its underlying effect it could cause to your daughter. So you need to explain it like he's 5.", "NTA but you should be getting supported by your mum as she knows what its like having newborns but from your brief i assume she is doing nothing, maybe try getting her more engaged and breaking things down for him as well eg.wash your hands and you can give her food etc.", "NTA. Speak with him again and make your boundaries clear. All kids are little rugrats, he\u2019s still learning. Try to turn this in to a learning opportunity for him. Take little bro under your wing.", "your baby is just 2 months old!! everyone should already be made to wash their hands before they interact with her. I grew up taking care of babies as a kid and in a family full of cousins. We definitely washed our hands before touching a baby that young. You can announce that due to the rise in RSV you want **everyone** to wash up before they touch the baby. NTA at all.", "NAH - But go about it gently . He is 12 so still young enough be stupid  but old enough to understand your point but across correctly.", "NTA. Your brother seems to treat your daughter as if she were a pet (which still wouldn't be ok) or a toy. 12 years old is well old enough to understand that other people do not solely exist for his entertainment, especially those younger than him. Has he seriously never been around babies before? This doesn't make sense as a behavior pattern. Even if he thought that they were just playing, it's worrisome that he hasn't developed the emotional intelligence to realize if the baby is uninterested or just doesn't want to be bothered, or is asleep, or anything like that.\n\nI'd say that your mother should be involved because this sort of behavioral issue could be stemming from something bigger. Plus, your brother clearly does not view you as a parent but merely as \"the brother\" with no authority other than what is given to you by your parents. It must be made clear to your brother by an authority he actually listens to that you are not just another kid but you are this baby's parent and protector and that role comes first over anything else.\n\nIf you believe that your mother won't back you up on this, do your level best to remove your child from that situation and setting because it will not be healthy for you or your girlfriend or your daughter.", "NTA she\u2019s only 2 months so ant the very least he should be washing his hands firsts.  and the parents really should know better too.", "NTA, but perhaps dealing with this in a paranoid and nearsighted way. The introduction of a new family member is a learning exercise for everyone, including a 12 year old. Poking and prodding is not cool, but that doesn't mean he should be cut off from building a relationship with your daughter. If anything, that course of action might lead to resentment and may make the situation worse. Let him feel included and grow into a more mature person through this.", "NTA.", "NTA but you need to be more firm with him. You are the grown up here so set the rules. I feel he just loves his niece but he needs to learn boundaries. Make him wash his hands and face before he interacts with her and then when you think enough is enough remove her from the situation", "NTA but he\u2019s 12 you need to explain to him to why he shouldn\u2019t like he is a small child", "Info: is there any developmental delay or intellectual disability with your brother?", "NTA. He's your little brother. You know what to do.", "NTA. No touching a baby without washing your hands first is a simple rule.", "You would be the AH if you didn\u2019t.", "NTA. Take advantage of this teachable moment. It is normal, healthy, and necessary to teach children to respect the physical boundaries and bodily autonomy of others.", "100% NTA. I know he\u2019s a 12 year old, but he should  know proper hygiene. I do suggest confronting your mother about this.", "NTA, if anything but for your child's safety, it's extremely important to instill in your brother now that when someone says don't touch something it means *don't touch it*. he's 12 years old and laughing at the idea of someone telling him to stop making physical contact with another person. nip this early.", "NTA I was younger then your brother when mine had a baby,  he said I had to wash my hands or use hand sanitizer before I could touch or hold my nephew and I never had a problem with it, if your brother throws a fit or treats it like a joke he doesn't need to touch the baby.", "NTA but don't just say he can't hold baby, tell him he can only hold baby if hands are well washed and he has on clean clothes or he doesn't get to touch her. Make the boundary and hold firm.by phrasing it this way you put the ball in his court. He gets to make the decision if he wants to hold daughter or not. If he complains you simply say, it's your decision, you know what the requirements are to hold baby, if you don't have clean hands and clean clothes you dont get touch her. If he is holding her and doing anything that you have told him not to do, say like kissing baby's face, simply remove the child from him immediately and say sorry, but you aren't adhering to our boundaries which are for baby's health and safety.", "NAH - \n\nFrom an old experienced mom with functional, healthy adult kids:\n\nOf course he should wash his hands and not breathe directly onto her face. But Is he just an immature kid who doesn't know how to be a cool uncle to a baby? Boys can be famously awkward about affection but its good for both if his motives are sweet so show him how. Remind him how Helen Keller was a perfectly normal little kid until she caught a fever.. conversely, you are his brother. You could turn around and poke him a bunch, see if he likes it. Either way... see if the lightbulb works. ;-)\n\nIts a little early to apply this next thought for you much but its fair to consider as you set policies now: Your baby has zero chance of growing up into a perfect world. Of course its your job to minimize early scarring for the sake of her development but that's a cold hard fact of her new life, so much so that it makes more sense to let her get used to a reasonable variety of people and circumstances while providing tools to manage them. If you don't you'll be setting her up for some really serious pain and possible dysfunction later in life. Nobody escapes from having to deal with life's shit - usually from people close to us, too.  \"Improvise, adapt and overcome!\" (They take practice.) It just seems like this is a growth point for you as a parent too. Please forgive me if I'm reading it wrong.", "Ok, Hi OP, you need to stand up for your baby, I hope this is a fake post, why are you letting your unhygienic and frankly dirty brother hold and touch your newborn 2 month old? You need to start setting boundaries right now for any child no matter what kind\u2019ve ruptions might cause, as a parent that\u2019s what you do. You are kind\u2019ve the T A for allowing this behavior to happen and acting like a passenger in the car instead of the driver so no YWNBTA if you said something but you kind\u2019ve of the T A for not doing anything about this before.", "NTA She's a baby, not a toy. Defend her autonomy.", "One of two things is happening here: either your brother has appealing hygiene that's a danger to his health, but you're somehow fine with not bringing that up as long as it doesn't relate to your daughter because fuck that guy, right? Or your brother is literally just a normal teen hanging out with his baby niece and interacting with her in a somewhat unruly way, and the only way you've thought of addressing this was \"ew, stop it, inappropriate\". \nI'm torn about which one makes you more definitely TA.", "NTA but it\u2019s good for her to have the germs in my opinion from what i know with multiple nephews. But he needs to understand the boundaries. I\u2019d also explain it like \u201chow would you feel if someone 3x as big as you did that all the time.\u201d he might need to learn personal space", "The hygiene thing fair enough.  But I think it's really sad that he can't give his niece a nice cuddle. \n\nNTA it's your baby.  But can you educate him into how to hold a baby and insist he washes his hands before he does, and that he showers before you visit?  \n\nDon't your parents make him shower?", "Nta so your daughter is already being trained in the males will unceasingly harass a girl, and she is a baby to boot!

It\u2019s great he is interested in her but good lord\u2026", "Yta your gonna have 12yr old they are grubby majority of boys are grubby your baby will survive", "Be grateful that your child has an uncle that wants to be involved.\n\nHe's excited. Likes it when she interacts with him, as much as a 2m does.\n\nYou're overreacting. A stereotypical new mum.\n\nDon't BTA and alienate your brother. Get a grip.

You\u2019re not at all the asshole for wanting to protect your child and for putting boundaries in place, but the way you want to do this is all wrong and you should be learning how to communicate difficult and embarrassing subjects to kids before your own kid gets old enough to need to be asked/told things like \u201csweetie, did you wipe your bottom properly?\u201d Or \u201choney, you smell, it\u2019s time you started wearing deodorant\u201d - believe me, those conversations are coming.\n\nIn this instance what you\u2019re proposing is more along the lines of \u201cHey, hands off the baby, stinky boy!\u201d than what you should be doing which is explaining to your brother that the baby is just brand new and hasn\u2019t had time to form a working immune system yet so until she\u2019s bigger everyone - including the adults - needs to wash their hands and face and wear clean clothes around her.\n\nHe\u2019s old enough to understand that (and this is an ESH because your parents and his school should also have made those messages clear by now, and he should be fine with that message and really should already know and practice these things already unless he\u2019s a bit slow).\n\nAnd as to the way he interacts with his niece - I assume he\u2019s the youngest kid in the family until her? You, I and most older siblings learn how to interact appropriately with babies when our little siblings are born because our parents show us how it\u2019s done.\n\nYour brother has clearly not had that teaching yet and it\u2019s not out of line for you to provide it - again, telling him to just keep back is a lost opportunity for you as well as him, because you\u2019ll have to manage that situation with other young relatives and especially if you have other kids in future.\n\nHe\u2019s clearly showing an interest and is curious about the baby so the way to do this is to say \u201chey, let\u2019s you and me go wash up and then we can show you how to hold her in ways that make her feel safe and loved, so she knows she can trust you to be an amazing uncle as she grows up\u201d - you are a role model for him and can help him learn a lot about how to be a good uncle and father by showing him what needs to be done for the baby.", "I.
