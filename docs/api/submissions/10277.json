Has he seriously never been around babies before? This doesn't make sense as a behavior pattern. Even if he thought that they were just playing, it's worrisome that he hasn't developed the emotional intelligence to realize if the baby is uninterested or just doesn't want to be bothered, or is asleep, or anything like that.\n\nI'd say that your mother should be involved because this sort of behavioral issue could be stemming from something bigger. Plus, your brother clearly does not view you as a parent but merely as \"the brother\" with no authority other than what is given to you by your parents.

COVID was rough for adults - but it was much tougher for kids because of their ages). What I *have* noticed a big change in is society has become much less tolerant of kids being kids generally. Pre COVID, a toddler has a temper tantum on a plane and people would sigh and grumble. Now they record the child's tantrum and blast the poor parents and airline over the entire internet even though, being frank, tantrums are age appropriate in toddlers and there's not much a parent can do to avoid them. \n\nPeople nowadays are unforgiving of age-appropriate failures in a way they weren't even 5 years ago.  And, frankly, 12YOs blanking on needing to shower so they don't smell or needing to wash their hands now that their parents or school aren't constantly telling them to do so *is* an age appropriate failure, even if it's gross.\n\n10 years ago I was reminding just as many middle schoolers that their martial arts uniforms need to get washed with soap in the laundry machines, and their long hair needs to be tied back for safety and they should wash their hands after sneezing, and the deodorant their parents pack in their bags only works if it's on their pits as I am now. The big difference has been that after a first offense we get parents of other kids (most of whom have their own hygiene issues!) getting so pissed off at the smelly kid who procrastinated throwing his gi in the wash too long that they're demanding we expel the offender. \n\nThere's a happy medium. Kids are gonna screw up. That's them being kids. Adults need to correct the screw up. That's our role as adults.

Things requiring executive function (remembering homework, chores, hygiene, etc) are one of the ways they usually are remarkably dumb. \n\nSo it doesn't need shame or anger from the adult, just patience, consistency and firm boundaries. It's frustrating but some of the kids in my martial arts class have been coming 5 years and STILL forget to pull their hair into a ponytail or wash their gi.

I used soap!\"\n\n\"Not well enough, dude. Your wash cloth isn't even wet, and you still smell like sweat. You gotta actually wash yourself.\"\n\nOne of my sisters needed the smell tests until 13. \n\nMeanwhile, my other brother was able to bathe himself without a smell test by 9 and I was done with them by 8. \n\nIt just really depends on the kid, but it's not that uncommon for a 12 YO to still struggle with hygiene.

For the record, if his dad had caught him before the cow stomped on his foot, there would've been hell to pay for wearing sandals in the barn during milking). \n\nLetting their kid wander barefoot through a livestock paddock is neglect.
