I have led successful projects over the last 10 years and have mentored several people who have gone on to bigger and better roles afterwards. I have a reputation of being a good coach and developer of talent and as a result of my successful project history and mentoring results, I get a lot of requests to mentor people. This ask comes from both management and individuals. The final decision who gets mentored is up to me. It depends on if I am already mentoring someone, if my bandwidth allows it or if I think the person would benefit from a mentor relationship. \n\nI am currently kicking off a high visibility project and do not have a mentor at the moment. I was approached by a manager from another area about mentoring one of their people and pulling them on to the project. The type of project aligns with the associates development goal / career path. The visibility from both mentorship and working on the project would push them in to higher position immediately at the end of the project. I had an idea of who the person was, but when the manager confirmed it, I declined and said my bandwidth would not allow me to take her on, I would simply be too busy. \n\nThe real reason for my decision is that I know the person and do not like her, professionally and personally. She has a history of reporting her co workers to management for any infraction or going to HR for for any perceived slight. The attrition rate in the her area is high and I would say it is toxic because of her presence. Long story short, I do not need that drama or want to take the risk for someone like that. Since I have final say and its not part of my official role, that should have been the end of it. Nope....\n\nThe following week, I was pulled in to HR for a meeting to discuss my decision not to mentor the person, yup, they complained. So in this meeting I am asked why and I state I did not have the capacity to take on the role. I was then pushed to change my decision as it would look bad if I did not. I reminded them that it is not part of my work description and role. We went back and forth and it ended, HR stated that this would not look good in my file. I still did not budge and have refused to take the person. \n\nI had a meeting with my boss and his boss afterwards and was told that I had nothing to worry about and that HR is basically afraid of this person and do what they can to prevent her from making waves. I still never admitted my real reason to them, but I think they got the message.\n\nInterestingly enough, the person turned has requested a 1 on 1 meeting with me, which I have declined multiple times. I also go out of my way avoid her if I am alone. \n\nSo AITA for declining to mentor a person because of their personality and history of complaining about co workers when they would be a good fit for the role and would help their career immensely?", "created_utc": 1691766084, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ob9nw/aita_for_declining_to_mentor_a_coworker_because/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It goes to show she couldn't even turn down the chance to go to HR to complain. \n\nIf you are made to have a 1 to 1. Record it if you can because I can imagine she is trying to pull something", "NTA. IMHO, you might consider filing a grievance against the supervisor who was trying to palm his problem employee off on you and against HR for threatening a negative entry in your file. At a minimum, review your HR file in a few months.", "NTA but to avoid getting yourself in trouble down the line, you'll unfortunately need to decline to mentor the next few people you're asked to mentor. I get that you're citing bandwidth issues and not anything specific to this individual, but it will still look really bad if you take on the next mentee that approaches you.", "NTA\n\nYou are smart not to meet with her, but you may have to (if she complains). You should have at least 2 other people in the room with you, and say you will be recording the meeting.\n\nPeople like her are dangerous. If she doesn't do well - it's your fault. If she screws something up - you sabotaged her. \n\nWhat would \"*help her career immensely*\" would be if she stopped tattling and worked on getting along with others. That, no project you have can ever help her with.\n\nStick to your guns.", "NTA.\n\nLife is too short to put up with shit when you do not have to.", "NTA - you are doing the exact right thing from a legal standpoint. OP please continue to NEVER tell the real reason. You will get caught up in this mess. Just continue with the neutral \"I don't have the bandwidth\" line. It is perfect. Never meet one-on-one. Always have a third person. I had to do this with someone who lied to management about me. Everything in writing, never meet by ourselves. Never pick up the phone, let it go to voicemail and then respond via email.  Fortunately for me I did a 3 month EEOC gig about 5 years ago which gave me lots of knowledge about what not to do and gave me the knowledge that this type of employee will take you down.

I wonder why the HR lets her have such a leeway.", "NTA - Since it is not part of your official duties and is up to you they can't dock your file for noncompliance, point that out to them as you can sue them.  You don't want the drama of this person and that is reason enough.", "/u/WhoElseBot poemify", "NTA, she is already harassing you.  Continue avoiding her at all costs.\n\nGood luck!", "Strong NTA, this is simply self-preservation and not setting yourself up as the next target. It\u2019s clear from their previous actions that they\u2019re not going to take NO for an answer. Be prepare to have more of their fallout in the future.", "NTA.  Seems like you are rightfully dodging a bullet.  However, the easiest way to avoid any further tension is to quickly fill this role - if there is another candidate you can recommend or take, then HR would have no reason to continue pushing.", "NTA  It sounds like you are wise to insulate yourself from this toxic person.  It sounds like it would only be a matter of time before she put you in the hotseat.  Unfortunately, there are those out there that never appreciate what others do to help them but will complain about any perceived injustice, etc.  Stand your ground and never, ever tell anyone the real reason that you won't mentor her.", "IMO, if *you* feel this way about her, is she really going to be a good fit for the position? To me, it sounds like you made the right choice. She sounds like a workplace bully, especially if HR is afraid of her. NTA", "If I were you I would contact HR about what the rules are about mentoring and your right to refusal. If you are in the US it seems like the Wild West of emolument law, if you are anywhere European or UK make sure you get a breakdown of what is expected if you have mentored before, if there are any processes for being a mentee and if there\u2019s an appeal for these things.\n\nDon\u2019t mention the complain when getting the information. \n\nI also wonder what the end goal of her complaint is because if there is a grievance raised for not liking how someone treated you, not working together is usually the solution. In this instance, she doesn\u2019t work with you currently and has put in a complaint in order to get to work with you?", "OP, if you\u2019re forced to meet with her, don\u2019t make it a 1:1. \n\nMake sure there\u2019s a witness, and do it over a virtual meeting tool so you can record it. \n\nAnd never tell anyone, even people you think you can trust, what your real reason is for declining to mentor her.  \n\nNTA", "I wonder if there is a race component to this issue.", "In corridors of power and corporate might,  \nI've stood my ground, climbed to a height.  \nTen years and more, I've shaped and trained,  \nReaping success where others waned.  \n\nApproached was I, with an offer fair,  \nTo mentor a soul, to show I care.  \nBut whispers and tales of old came clear,  \nShe\u2019s a storm, a force I rather not be near.  \n\nThe dance of politics, a game so sly,  \nA meeting with HR, under the sky.  \nThey pushed and prodded, to change my stand,  \nBut in my domain, I'm in command.  \n\nSecret tales, whispered by the side,  \nMy superiors too, in me confide.  \nFear her they do, her grasp so firm,  \nYet my path is mine, I'll let none confirm.  \n\nShe seeks an audience, a face to face,  \nI decline, seeking no embrace.  \nFor in the game of work and play,  \nOne must choose their battles, come what may.  \n\nAITA, for refusing this dance?  \nFor seeing past her bright career chance?  \nFor in the realm of trust and toil,  \nOne's nature can the cauldron boil.", "There is no actual role, its a \"volunteer\" type of role. It is not defined or documented at all. That is the reason HR could not push me, it was and always has been at my discretion.", "Luckily, the mentor role is not documented anywhere, its been a professional courtesy type of offering.\n\nHer complaint was basically me not accepting her when she meets the qualifications, even thought there is nothing documented.", "HR seems to be very cautious with this person, there is likely to be some protected characteristic they have that they can argue discrimination on.", "Sure - and you'll still be right for refusing for any case.  But if you worry about potential reputational or fallout because of singling this employee out, an easy solution is to fill this volunteer role ASAP to squash any further conversations about it.", "Absolutely wrong from a legal standpoint.  Then everyone would know that OP did have bandwidth.  OP please continue to NEVER tell the real reason.  You will get caught up in this mess.  Just continue with the neutral \"I don't have the bandwidth\" line.  It is perfect.  Never meet one-on-one.  Always have a third person.  I had to do this with someone who lied to management about me.   Everything in writing, never meet by ourselves.  Fortunately for me I did a 3 month EEOC gig about 5 years ago which gave me lots of knowledge about what not to do.", "Second this, if you say you don't have bandwidth then you end up mentoring someone else it will show you \"lied.\" IANAL but she would likely not have a valid/winnable case, but the \"lie\"  could be enough to justify opening an investigation/case that could make your life miserable. \n\nJust do not take on a mentee at this time for this project. A while later/after this project is done you can take someone else on once your bandwidth has improved.", "That's a good point, but \"legal standpoint?\" lmao try again."]}
