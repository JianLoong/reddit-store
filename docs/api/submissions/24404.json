As if he knows that his critique of the woman wouldn't pass muster.", "OP made a comment in which he says that nobody likes her because she acted like a manager when she wasn't one and was putting other people down to make herself look good and was taking stupid minor complaints to the HR.", "This was a long post and full of good questions.\n\nInitially the complaints would go to managers reporting on co workers for conduct and work problems. These complaints would range from coming in late (we have flexible work hours), to quality issues where she felt people were not doing their work (managers and customers did not have a problem), and professional conduct (again managers and customers did not have a problem), being excluded from non work events like lunch or drinks (this happened after people found out she was going to managers to complain) and not being able to join other teams or projects (again, people did not want to be around her because of the complaints).\n\nThe general feeling while she was talented and was succeeding in her role, she thought she should be in a managerial role and acted like such. She would go out of her way to make others look bad to make herself look better. Eventually people just tuned her out past a professional capacity.\n\nThe HR complaints started after there was an incident where there was a confrontation between her and another associate about some issue on a project. It was frosty but professional. The person she was engaged with later on was going over the incident with another coworker on a Teams chat after a meeting. The person forgot to stop sharing their screen and she saw him call her \"a fucking asshole\" in a private chat. Armed with screenshots she went to HR, the person she reported was written up and had to have hostile workplace training. He left the company shortly after the incident.\n\nAfter than, any and every issue went to HR. I do not recall anyone else getting written up or in trouble, just lots of mediation meetings.\n\nI do feel bad, because if she was not so entitled, quick to break trust and not be ambitious to the point of fucking over everyone she would be a great candidate for the mentorship and be an great on the project team. She would be an asset to the company long term. I am just not willing to risk my career giving her this opportunity. Anyone who knows what a mentor/mentee relationship knows there is a lot of candid feedback and a lot of trust. It is professional, but also becomes very personal at times.\n\nFor the record, in the last 10 years, I have mentored (full blown year long mentorships) 6 associates. 4 of them have been women, who I still retain a strong friendship with and speak to often.\n\nAt the end of the day, there is no formal mentorship program, nothing in writing and nothing HR can force on me. As for my risk with HR, my first trip to HR at the company every was this incident, which kinda pissed me off to be honest and only made me lock down my decision even further.

Why make yourself a victim?", "\"I don't have the bandwidth to take on a mentoring role at this time.\" Then after 3 refusals to mentor this one person, OP chooses to mentor someone else. That gives the original person the traction to make a claim that OP was discriminating against them personally.   If OP is male, it's misogyny. If they are of different ethnicities, then it's racist. That's a lawsuit against the company, since they didn't force the issue.", "Given your suggestions have been logical nonsense so far, you'll forgive us for not caring about your opinion on legality.", "Yes, legal standpoint - if mentee is from a protected class and there was a in fact a \"mentee\" slot that gets filled, there is an argument (good or bad) that he/she didn't get it based on protected class.  If there was no slot, then no discrimination because **no one** got the position.", "This is it exactly!  Did a couple of these cases for the agency I worked for - which is why I had the EEOC training.  You can't say you didn't get a position if there is no position!  So don't create a (volunteer, mentee) position!"]}
