A few years later Beth had another baby (Jenny) with another man. Over the years me and my family would try hard to keep involved in John's life.

We also had to get a gift for Jenny if we wanted to give John a gift.\n\nA little more than half a year ago John did something really bad to one of his cousin's. I cannot talk about that here, but I'll just say it was bad enough that no one in the family wants anything to do with John. Now the point of the post isn't about what happened with John it's about Jenny.\n\nBeth has to her credit been very understanding about us not wanting to see John anymore. However she has been badgering us to continue to include Jenny. Jenny apparently misses us. Their mom says that since they don't have any other family and we have always included Jenny we are our family.\u00a0\n\nWe however don't see her that way. There's been several discussions about it and no one in the family wants to see her again. The consensus is we all find her annoying due to her tendency to have tantrums, but we put up with her because we knew we otherwise wouldn't have been able to have a relationship with John. Also we feel like if we continue to include Jenny it leaves an open door for John and definitely something no one wants.\n\nJenny was not invited to this last Thanksgiving or Christmas. Beth said Jenny was very sad she didn't get invited, but it made since since the incident with John just happened. Since in her opinion enough time has passed She asked that we include Jenny in our Easter party coming up. We usually throw a big party with an Easter egg hunt every year and Jenny is apparently really looking forward to it. So now we're in this tough place of where I guess we are technically punishing a child for something she didn't do, but we really just don't see her as family and don't enjoy her company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomeone asked me to add their ages.

You never wanted to include Jenny in the first  place. Your family was forced to include her if you wanted to maintain a relationship with John. This isn't punishing Jenny for what John did. This your family no longer being blackmailed into including her in order to have a relationship with John. Beth is the one who set her up for failure by forcing a relationship on your family.  Also this would have eventually happened anyway once Jonh was an adult  because then the family wouldn't have needed Beth's permission anyway\n Beth is the A.H. for using access to her son to force a relationship with her daughter who is not related to you. I don't understand people who tried to force family relationship onto others.", "NTA, if she doesn't get that the only reason you guys interacted with Jenny is because she was basically holding your relationship with John as hostage, she severely lacks awareness. \n\nIt's sad that her daughter was used that way, because she developed what she believed was a genuine relationship with all of you. It's sad that the link is severed that way, through no fault of her own. But you're not punishing Jenny for what John did. You decided you don't want to spend time with an annoying child whom you were not interested in and is used to keep a part of your brother still in contact with you. \n\nSay just that to Beth : You forced us to interact with Jenny as a bargaining chip to maintain a relationship with John, who we are truly related to. We had no choice but to entertain her terrible, annoying behaviour in order to spend time with the son of our deceased brother/son/cousin. If we don't spend time with John, we don't have to spend time to Jenny. You lost the upper hand, you can't make us spend time with her, even if it breaks her heart. And we don't have to explain ourselves to her. You created the situation, you explain that to her yourself. You can even make us the bad guys if you want. But we're not inviting Jenny.", "While I feel bad for Jenny and she absolutely doesn\u2019t deserve to be in this situation, it is one Beth made.

Jenny isn't your family unless you feel that way too, and the situation is her mom's fault for forcing you into including her by threatening to withhold John.\n\nThat said, it isn't necessary for judgement, but I N F O how old are these kids? I assume that if John did something so reprehensible that you went NC, they must at least be teenagers? In which case Jenny can socialize with friends at school, in clubs, and playing sports.\n\nETA: You'd still be NTA, but it might be a little different if Jenny suddenly found herself uninvited to a fun event coming up this weekend. However, you've been NC for at least 6 months, so Jenny's mom has had plenty of time to acclimate her to the notion that John's family just isn't part of her life anymore.", "NTA\n\nHer mom created this situation by forcing her to be included in ANOTHER family's activities. \n\nShe's not part of that family and it's normal that she will be excluded at some point.", "NTA You include Jenny at her mother's insistence in order to maintain a relationship with John. At this time your family decided to forgo a relationship with John due to his behavioural issues. You're under no obligation to continue to have a relationship with Jenny no matter how much her mother pleads with and guilt trips your family There was never going to be a good or easy time to stop seeing Jenny.

It is not hard to simply explain to the child from the start that they have different family connections.", "NTA. I feel really sorry for Jenny but she is not your responsability. It iss all on her mom for forcing a relationship you guys clearly did not want and now she has to deal with the fallout of her actions.", "NTA Jenny is NOT related to you and not your problem anymore.

Thanks to her mom you are her family in a kid's mind.", "NTA, she\u2019s only been included in these things because her mom forced it", "INFO: who is the 'we' you are describing, that doesn't want Jenny to come to the event?", "I am just dying to know what did john do", "NAH. I'm sure you can understand and have empathy for Jenny. She feels like she's losing family, even if you don't see her that way, and that's gross and not fun. So I can't really call her the asshole. And of course you don't have an obligation going forward to include her. So you're not the asshole. I would guess that Jenny's mom could be better about getting her involved in other activities. It sounds like she's trying to be manipulative. There are definitely public Easter egg hunts. Anyway. I feel for all of you.", "Info: How old are the kids?", "Soft NTA. You are right in that she technically isn't family but now she looks forward to spending time with you guys. Not sure of their age but especially if they're young then you guys mean something to her.

Ultimately, I'm going to go NAH.\n\nIt just sounds like the family is going through an extremely difficult time and emotions are running high. It's complicated.\n\nWithout knowing ages, I'd venture to say Jenny is probably acting out because if John did something so bad that the entire family is distancing themselves from him, I imagine he's been getting a lot of attention (even if it's bad) and has been the focus of many conversations. Jenny is probably feeling shoved to the side and seeking out ways to have some of the spot light. And the people still in her life are probably foregoing correct upbringings or even enabling her behavior because they feel bad about punishing her given her situation. I realize that kind of behavior is very tough to handle, and I worry for her and am hoping she's getting some help. \n\nBut, ultimately, no one is obligated to have anyone in their life they didn't choose to. While some people do have that urge to be everyone's hero and support Jenny regardless of her tantrums -- if you're not those people forcing it would just be harmful and she'd begin to see herself as a burden people begrudgingly keep around.\n\nSounds like a tough situation, OP... good luck, and just practice kindness.", "YTA - Your side of the family sounds toxic tbh. You strung Jenny along out of some obligation for years and once you saw an out you dropped her? \n\nIn that time none of you ever developed a relationship with Jenny or grew to actually like her?

Sounds like you were blackmailed into including Jenny at the cost of seeing John. Now that your family no longer wishes to have contact with John, the blackmail ends.\n\nSince ages were left out it's hard to determine if Jenny can comprehend this or not. But it's not your kid, and it's very weird that your former SIL wants to foist her kid off on people whom she has no real connection to anymore. My heart goes out to the kid, but you've done nothing wrong when your hand was forced by her mother. This is entirely her fault to be in this situation.", "NTA - this kid is 12 years old - definitely too old for Easter Egg hunts. She's not 5!! She is definitely old enough to have her own friends and activities. It is sad she is getting shunned for her brother's bad behavior but that is her mom's problem to solve.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA because that little girl sees you guys as family, and I mean I feel like you are. Your brother may have passed, but that\u2019s your sister in laws daughter. People move on when spouses die but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to cut them off and confuse the poor kids. You are her aunts and uncles, the only ones she\u2019s ever known. She\u2019s your nephews sister. It seems really cruel to punish a little girl and take away her family for really no reason other than you (grown adults btw) not liking a little girl. She has no one else, you guys ARE her family. You can\u2019t just ditch her because John fucked up. Family isn\u2019t just blood relation, she grew up with you guys. Her brother is related to you guys. This seems really mean for no reason. She\u2019s gonna grow up traumatized that her family abandoned her for no reason. Beth lost her husband and now is watching the people she thought were her family (yes family includes in laws even when your spouse dies) abandon her and her kid. How heartless can you be to hear that a little girl misses you and you just don\u2019t even care?", "If she has no other family, do the right thing and invite Jenny and Beth to the parties throughout the year.  You don't need to be 'blood' to be family.  If whatever John did was so bad to disown him then that's on him. Jenny shouldn't be a victim of his bad behavior.  It may be 1-3x a year you see her the most. How is that such a hardship?  And as she gets older the tantrums will pass. Or put the ultimatum on Beth to teach her child to behave or the invites end.", "INFO - were your brother and Beth legally considered common law or married when John was born? When your brother was alive, did Jenny and John have interactions together with your family or is it something Beth only insisted on after your brother\u2019s passing?", "Honestly,  my heart hurts for Jenny.  She's an innocent in all of this. Yes, she isn't a small child, but all of you are the only family she has.   The serious damages she'll have as an adult will be monumental on every level. \n\nHow many years was she apart of your family?  Please tell me it wasn't the entire 12 years and now you want nothing to do with her?\n\nI think you are TA unless she has serious mental health issues that you need to distant yourself from. \n\nGood luck on whatever you decide.", "YTA,she is just a kid.You would send a very wrong message if you punished her for something she didn\u2019t do,no matter how annoying you find her otherwise", "YTA\n\nAll you have done is punish a child for something she didn't do.  She loved your family and then when you couldn't get what you wanted from her you tossed her away like yesterday's garbage.  Way to teach a child that people's love won't last.  \n\nShe lost her brother in some fashion and now she's losing what, to her, is an extended family.  \n\nIt's a big egg hunt. Include the girl and show compassion.", "Did you not include Jenny's age because she's still a child, and this is an AH move? Or is she a teenager now? I know you said child at the end, but for clarification, how old? I know it's not ideal, but you even said it yourself, your punishing a child for the actions of her sibling, and before you say she's annoying again I must ask you what child isn't remotely high-energy when out and about, some yes, but of Jenny sees you as her Auntie she's probably excited to see you. The thing is, you're too far in now to shun her for the actions of her brother, and when she becomes a teenager and wants to hang out with her friends she'll probably not be as jazzed to attend family functions as most teenagers see them as lame.\n\nYTA- You're punishing a child, and if the main concern is her brother being around, then get a restraining order against him.", "YTA. Without context on what john did and going solely on how you dropped Jenny; your family sounds very fickle.", "Don't hurt a child like this. What harm is there to extend an invitation and be pleasant? You don't have to make a fuss over her or tell her you love her.  Betting your brother would be disappointed at your pettiness.", "YTA. It's a kid, kids throw tantrums and are annoying. Don't punish her for being a child and for the actions of someone else just bc you might or might not have to deal with him again later. \n\nEdit: someone just pointed out jenny is 12, which is past the tantrum part and which changes my answer a little. But I still think cutting her off is basically using what John did to punish her.  Maybe invite them to fewer things, like only the really big family gatherings, since you're the only family she has in the area.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Makes no sense why people blame OP\u2019s family being coerced to date to include Jenny while Jenny\u2019s real dad\u2019s family and Beth herself are apparently not the true A.H.s for creating this mess and not stepping up for Jenny.", "I definitely see why you would say it's mean and why you would think OP and his family are being A. I don't agree, but I understand your point. I just think that maintaining a \"fake\" relationship with someone, even a minor, just to keep the peace and not be mean is not ideal. It's a relationship where Jenny would want to spend time with John's extended family and where John's extended family humor her for the sake  of not hurting her feelings too much. If she were to realize, I don't know which would hurt more : being cast aside immediately or being tolerated by people who feel lukewarm about her. \n\nHence me choosing N T A. I read the Y T A comments and I can't help but nod too. She's a child and does not deserve to be set aside for what her brother did.\n\nBut the root of it all is they never wanted a relationship with Jenny. It's a \"lie\" that was maintained to have access to John. I don't think continuing the lie would do much good for Jenny.", "Could the tantrums be a result of her acting out from being molested by her brother?", "Also add the fact that your deceased brother never interacted with Jenny introducing her to your family etc. and that Beth isn\u2019t your sister-in-LAW for marrying in or as common law spouse.", "The post\u2026\u2026\u2026? Says so\u2026\u2026..?", "Oh hold up. Looked through your comments. You\u2019re just a mean troll. \ud83d\udc4c", "It\u2019s their nephews sister\u2026.not some random kid. She\u2019s related by blood to their nephew. I could just never imagine not seeing that little girl as family too. Just seems so petty and mean to me", "[removed]", "[removed]", "They aren\u2019t related at all. Your mom and dad created a family, in OPs case they are not part of SILs family just the nephew", "I agree that Beth is TA, but none of that is Jenny\u2019s fault.", "I get what you're saying, but I can't help but feel like op is going \"we never liked you, we only liked your brother, but now that he's done something bad we're taking this chance to finally be rid of you!\" Idk, that strikes me as like a wicked stepmother thing to do. Sure, the lying isn't great, but I think it's a lesser evil than isolation when the girl has no other family around.", "This part. I hope Jenny is safe.", "John doesn't have a history of molestation as far as I know.", "Without knowing details, *whatever* John did has to have been terrible.  And that little girl just... lives with him. \n\nNot OP's problem, but man, there's nothing like being a kid terrified of an older sibling (but he's still a minor, too, so it's an impossible situation).", "As someone who comes from a blended family on All sides it\u2019s very easy to not see someone as family it\u2019s not how that works I consider one of my closest friends more family then my oldest sister and my aunt considers my older sister family but not me the relationship was never built I tried as a child but it hurt to get rejected and see that I was only included for the sake of the rest of the family so honestly they need to let that girl know now so she can separate those relationships and feelings that her mother forcibly made knowing it could blow up in her face", "I think it would be a much more complicated situation for him personally considering John is his son and he would have still had to be involved in his life since he's a minor.", "It's not the brother's kid.", "My brother did not abuse anyone. You have issues.", "Read the post. The brother died before she was born. No one is abusing the girl. The girl has a mother so foster care is a ridiculous suggestion. The brother didn\u2019t abuse anybody. Read the post.", "It\u2019s the nephews own sister\u2026.if people can\u2019t see how that makes her family idk what to say but I can\u2019t imagine it. I just feel so sick and sad for the poor girl", "Never said it was Jenny\u2019s fault but just because Jenny is innocent in this it doesn\u2019t make it OPs or her family\u2019s job to fix it or make it better for her, it\u2019s all on her mother", "The mother who is clearly unqualified. Jenny is going to end up stuck between a rock and a hard place, which could absolutely be mitigated if OP and his family chose compassion over spite."]}
