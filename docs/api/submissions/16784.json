She had just moved to my town this month, and did not want to go through the whole 4 hour long graduation ceremony, but she did want to go up and take pictures and say goodbye to her friends before they all disbursed over the country.\n\nMy girlfriend asked me to make the drive with her (4 hours in total). I did not really want to go, but we have been going through a rough patch and I thought this would be a good way to spend some much needed time together. Plus, we have been together 2 years, so it was all of our mutual friends graduating and I wanted to say goodbye to everyone and see them all one last time.\n\nSo, we left at 8 AM on a Sunday and made the drive. When we got there, it was chaos. Everyone was leaving the auditorium, and there was a massive crowd. I told her that I would go and find a place to park the car, and she could go find our friends and figure out what the plan was. I told her that I would text her where I parked, and I would stay in the car until she called or texted me to tell me where we were meeting, and if she didn't call me then I would assume that we were meeting at the car, which she agreed to.\n\nSo I parked the car only about a 5-10 minuet walk from where I dropped her off, and texted her where I was. She responded saying \"Okay\" and then I sat in the car and proceeded to wait over an hour. I thought it was weird, but I figured she was just having a hard time finding everyone in the crowd. Plus, I just trusted her to contact me when she found everyone.\n\nWhen she finally gets back, she told me that she found everyone and had been taking pictures and saying goodbye to everyone. She said it was an accident and just got caught up in the confusion of the crowd. I was hurt, but asked where they were and if we were meeting up somewhere. She reluctantly told me that all of our friends had left with their families right after the ceremony, and that they were gone. Some of them out of the country, I might add, so I totally missed my chance to say goodbye to them.\n\nI was heartbroken that she left me out of the plans she had begged me to come to. She knew where I was parked, and she could have easily asked me to meet them.\n\nSeeing as we still have a 2 hour drive home, and it was technically her graduation day, I told her that \"we can talk about this later because I don't want to ruin your graduation day.\"\n\nSo today I was (obviously) in a mood, and she asked me if I was mad at her. I was like... \"Of CORSE I'm mad at you... you left me in the car like a dog...\"\n\nI guess she took me saying \"It's fine we can talk about it later\" as \"Don't worry about it we're fine\".\n\nShe then told me: \"Even though I forgot you, if you thought that then why didn't you call or text me?\"\n\nAITA for not just letting it go? Should I have called or texted her after it had been a long time?\n\nEDIT 1: I should clarify that she drove up, I was car company. I wasn\u2019t sitting in the car to \u201chave a reason to be angry with her\u201d I just genuinely trusted the plan. I wasn\u2019t angry until she came back and told me what had happened. I was happily sitting in the car reading my book and watching tiktoks! \nAlso I did not want to ruin her grad which is why I told her we could talk about it later! After words we got lunch and I have her her graduation present, I just thought we\u2019d talk about it the next day but she seemed to think it was fine now.", "created_utc": 1683630187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cmddr/aita_for_not_reminding_my_girlfriend_to_come_get/", "score": 991, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead, you sat in the car and pouted like a child, and made this a much bigger conflict than it needed to be.", "Both of you act like children.\n\nOf course it was her fault to not text you, but if you were waiting and had nothing to do, picking up the phone to make a call would have been easy to do.\n\nI don't really get why you have been waiting in the car in the first place.

Your girlfriend forgot about you and left you waiting in the car for an hour without communicating with you, which was not fair to you. However, you also had the opportunity to reach out to her when she did not contact you after a long time. It's understandable that you were hurt and upset about missing the chance to say goodbye to your friends, but it's important to communicate with your partner in a healthy and constructive way.  \nInstead of holding in your feelings until you were in a bad mood, you could have expressed your disappointment and hurt when your girlfriend returned to the car. You could have asked her why she did not communicate with you and expressed your frustration at missing out on saying goodbye to your friends. By communicating your feelings in the moment, you could have avoided the situation escalating and potentially hurting your relationship further.  \nIn summary, you are not necessarily the asshole for not reminding your girlfriend to come get you, but it would have been more constructive to communicate with her in the moment instead of holding in your feelings until later.  \nRegenerate response", "YTA.

You chose to sit in the car because ... why did you stay in the car for an hour, OP?", "YTA - why didn\u2019t you just call her. Makes no sense to me to not communicate then complain. Especially as you said you never told her if she didn\u2019t text you\u2019d \u2018assume\u2019 youd meet at the car. Why would that be an assumption. Id assume you\u2019d come to meet us once you\u2019d parked", "I\u2019m finding it hard to believe she just forgot. Surely, someone said, \u201cHow\u2019s so and so?\u201d which would have reminded her she had a travel partner. I can\u2019t speak for her motives, of course, but I think that needs to be unpacked. I do find it odd that you were patient enough to wait a whole hour. A simple call or text could have changed the whole experience. \n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering \u2014 is this how things often play out in your relationship? Does she disregard you? Are you passive? Or is this a one-off lack of communication that resulted in an unhappy result for you and everything else is cool? \n\nI\u2019m leaning ESH but I\u2019m afraid that your gf is the real AH.

It\u2019s a 2 hour drive. You would\u2019ve gotten to the venue at approximately 10 am. It\u2019s a 4 hour graduation ceremony. Everyone was already leaving when you arrived. That means that we\u2019re supposed to believe that this graduation started at the latest, 6 am? But the start time would\u2019ve probably been before that if it was a 4 hour graduation, and people were already leaving (chaos) at around 10 am. So if the parking lot was already chaotic at 10 am after a 4 hour ceremony, it means the ceremony\u2019s start time was probably scheduled around 5-5:30 am. Is that what you want us to believe? \n\nI think you\u2019re a troll, but if not, let me ask you some questions. \n\nOnce she didn\u2019t get back in touch with you after you parked, why didn\u2019t you call her (repeatedly if necessary)? \n\nWhy didn\u2019t you try to make your way into the auditorium to find her or tell her where you were waiting?\n\nDid you have a ticket to the graduation in case you needed it to get into the auditorium?\n\nIf you both knew the ceremony would have ended just before you arrived, why didn\u2019t you start driving earlier than 8 am so you\u2019d get there before chaos set in?\n\nDid your GF have a meeting spot prearranged with her friends? \n\nI understand that you\u2019re both young and probably didn\u2019t know nor think about how \u201ccrazy\u201d graduation ceremony logistics can get, what appears to be the hastily put together plan of driving to the auditorium with no plan in place for where and when she\u2019d meet her friends was a recipe for failure. \n\nESH\n\nYou were justifiably upset.

It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to realize that she just forgot to text you.\n\nThe phone works both ways, it seems like you sat in the car on purpose to be pissed.

Call whoever you wait on after 10-20 minutes. YTA for not advocating for yourself and creating this drama.

Youre still young so im gonna tell you this from experience. Not everything in life is about who\u2019s right and wrong. Sometimes you have to think if your actions towards the wrong doer is actually worth it. In this case was it really worth not getting to see and say goodbye to your friends just because you felt your gf should be the one calling you??  Youre also causing a deeper pain to yourself than necessary cus in this case you could have mitigated the severity of the outcome. One phone call from you and you would have avoided wasting a 4 hour drive to just ended up sitting in your car.

You knew it was chaotic \n\nYou sound a bit exhausting if your default is to pout and exacerbate an issue without any self advocacy", "ESH\n\nOnce you're an adult you have to take responsibility for yourself. Somebody forgets you in the car? Yes that's shitty and their fault. But sitting there for an hour doing nothing is YOUR fault. You are the one that needs to reach out and ask where your friends are meeting.\n\nIt's the same at work, nobody wants to work with a person that just sits at their desk for 8 hours drinking coffee because nobody told them to work on a specific project. There's always an obligation on both sides.", "YTA- play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Yes she should have called you but you can also walk yourself up to the ceremony and find her instead of making an issue out of a nonissue on her graduation day. You aren\u2019t a child anymore.", "Yeah ESH. \n\nIt sucks she forgot about you, but you could\u2019ve called to follow up. It\u2019s not entirely her fault that you missed out on it, you have autonomy as well. I have social anxiety so I understand wanting to wait for her to chaperone you there, but at the same time, you could have texted or called again.

It may be time for a break.", "YTA\n\nIf you really wanted to see everyone before they left, you should just parked the car and gone with her\n\nShe doesn't have the power to stop others from leaving, or force them into making plans to meet you later.

You said \"it's fine\" so she took your word for it!!", "YTA.\n\nAlso... why would this even be the plan? Wouldn't it have been way easier for you to park, then walk back to the event and for you to then call her to meet somewhere?", "Esh", "ESH This is honestly ridiculous and bad planning. Why you would even agree or think about sitting waiting in the car? Like why you needed her to come back to your car, how this was even a meeting point? You went there to meet people. You two are not tied, nothing stopped you from enjoying celebration.", "YTA, it was an hour dude and you could have called her. She got caught up in the moment and you didn't want to go in the first place so I am not buying you cared about not saying good bye to these people.", "ESH. \n\nYou waited in the car for an hour and didn\u2019t pause to think there was something going on? Your girlfriend is in a huge crowd of people, didn\u2019t respond, and you just\u2026sat there? Lol get out and call her. Walk around until you see your friends. Do literally anything. You\u2019re the one that sat there like a dog. \n\nShe should have texted you back, or called, for sure, but you also just sat there twiddling your thumbs lol. Don\u2019t act like you have no agency here. Get out of the car and do something next time.", "ESH. Why didn\u2019t you call/text again?\n\nThe number of people that see this as a relationship ending act is mind blowing. OP, does she get flustered in busy situations? Has she been super stressed with moving and graduating? Are crowds overwhelming? Is she just kind of spacy? I mean, it really sucks that she left you like that at the car\u2026 but I\u2019d hardly take it as a mandate on how important she ranks you in her life. If this is enough for you to leave her as so many Redditors seem to think then she deserves better too. Talk it over. And then forgive. You can\u2019t keep holding it over her.", "ESH\n\nHer more so, to be clear. You had a particular plan. Even if you didn\u2019t have a plan, how did you not even cross her mind during that hour? That\u2019s cold. Ice cold.\n\nBut you have hands and a mouth and a phone. And legs. You could have called her, or gotten out of the car to look for her. You can say you thought it was taking an hour for her to find *anyone* she knew, but few will believe it. Seems more like you eventually realised she\u2019d forgotten you, then stayed until she returned to prove your point.", "ESH.  This relationship sounds really immature and perhaps this was a wake up call for you both.", "ESH", "ESH. It's her graduation, an important life event.

She got busy and forgot you, but you also just sat there. You could have easily gotten out of the car or called her.", "ESH. Her for just thinking about herself and forgetting all about you. I was married to someone who did this regularly and it was the shittiest feeling every single time it happened. Not saying your partner is like this, and it was probably just caught up in the moment situation, but keep it in the back of your mind if it happens more. I would feel very left out and upset though if I were you and didn't get to say goodbye to any friends. \n\nYou suck here for not just texting or calling after a certain amount of time. I know the agreement was if you don't get a text then the meeting spot is your car, but after a certain point just a quick call to confirm would have been smart.", "NTA, she was being selfish", "ESH. I've been to lots of graduations. They really are chaotic. I couldn't find some of my friends at my own graduation, and I missed getting to tell them good-bye. I felt like I was looking for them for just a few minutes, but nearly an hour had gone by. Almost everyone went straight home after the ceremony. But you just sat there, waiting for her. You have free will, same as the rest of us. Get out of the car and go look for her.", "Bruh, do you have no agency of your own?  Why would you just sit there and wait and miss out on saying goodbye to your friends?  You put all the responsibility on her, and took none yourself, and you're pissed at *her*?\n\nIf you don't care about your friends enough to walk over on your own without your girlfriend arranging everything for you, why should she put any effort to manage it for you?

First, there's no way anyone just blindly walks around a graduation just hoping to find the group they're meeting up with without any real direction. Second, they did have a clear plan and good communication, that fell through, because of the gf who only thought about herself (regardless of it being her day). He could have gotten out the car? No, no, no. She SHOULD HAVE sent him the text/call about location. Campuses came be big and dense.", "YTA.\nYes, it was a bit rude to forget about you in the car. However, you\u2019re an adult.

I feel that you could give her a pass for this one. Maybe if she had a habit of forgetting you or leaving you out, i would be more sympathetic, but if you want to be in a long-term relationship, you need to accept that not all days will be about you. Sometimes you need to take a back seat and let your s/o do their thing, even if you feel a little left out.\nYou guys had a miscommunication, which honestly may have been her fault, but the way you\u2019re acting is childish to the extreme.", "YTA - sure she was inconsiderate, but are you really so dense as to not understand how that could happen when she's in amongst a load of people, all trying to speak with each other and get on with their plans? Its hectic. I understand that would have been frustrating for you, but instead of acting like an adult you just sat and got more and more upset about it. So you could be pissed with her later because why should you have to do anything or show any consideration right?

You had several options, you could've gone and walked to the auditorium and searched around, you could've called another friend expressing your wants to see them, you could've made plans with friends prior to driving two hours.

Your partner also holds responsibility here, she could've called you, could've shared where you were with friends, could've texted you to let you know she was doing photos. \n\nGraduations can be overwhelming, but this whole mess is the product of poor planning. You didn't communicate with eachother, or your friends. A plan was made and not executed.

In this case find a group of people. OP had her task to park and to wait and her gf was tasked to find these people and tell her. \n\nSure, I would've texted or called but OP had said that there was a lot going on and unless OPs gf had her ringer on her phone up loud enough, she probably wouldn't have noticed her phone unless she checked it and in that case she would then text OP like she was supposed to. \n\nI don't think anyone is the AH necessarily. OP did what she was asked to do, and her gf did what she was supposed to do, but forgot to text/call OP which is annoying but I would understand because there was probably a lot going on there and its hard to stop and do something in a crowd plus trying to talk to people. At least I'd find it harder to do, that seems very overwhelming.\n\n\n(On phone so format is gonna suck sorry lol)", "It is not good that she forgot about you and our plan, but at the same time, this kind of even is messy and confusing and it is REALLY EASY to get distracted.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe plan was terrible, and you are both at fault for that.  You for the suggestion, and her for agreeing to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, the fact that you stuck to the plan without calling or going to find her is pretty wild to me.  Did you grow up with a military family where following orders and not thinking for yourself was prioritized?", "I think you were looking for a reason to be mad at her, honestly. It\u2019s not hard for me to understand how she could get caught up in the chaos of the crowds and trying to find her friends.

You are a grown ass adult you had to know it was chaotic when you got there when you dropped her off that there was already a crowd of people going every which way so maybe she didn\u2019t quite hear everything you said and you could\u2019ve gotten out of the car at anytime you wanted to to try to go and find her. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a child and we\u2019re told to stay in the car and not leave it.

Very strange. ESH.", "What I'm mainly confused about is the supposed group of mutual friends. I presume they all know she lives 2 hours away and you live together, no one asked how the GF got there? Or if you came with her? Which would then remind her that you exist...?\n\nI mean of course you're not joined at the hip, but if my (or our) friends knew my partner and I were coming to an event and only I walked in I'm sure they would ask where he was.", "If I were you I would of walked over instead of waiting in the car. You have legs right? You did that to yourself. People were probably pulling her right, left and center to talk and to take pics. How does it make sense for her to walk a total of 20 mins to fetch you instead of you just walking 10 to her?", "Both of you are the AH and act like children. She forgot you in the car because she was caught up in the moment, and you decided to sit and pout about it instead of making a phone call.", "YTA I can see her getting lost in the confusion, graduations are hectic especially when you're there when everyone is leaving. She texted you, you didn't respond. You also said that you assumed you guys were meeting at the car if you didn't hear anything. So she probably assumed that you were fine there. \n\nYou wanted to be a victim so you sat in the car and let it fester. You should have asked \"where are you?\" But you decided to get mad and not communicate so you could say that you were forgotten and hold it against her later. You could have at least made the effort of asking and walked to the entrance on your own.", "YTA with your whole general attitude.

Which does seem odd to me. Driving four hours round trip to go take photos with friends but not walk in the ceremony...\n\n>She had just moved to my town this month, and did not want to go through the whole 4 hour long graduation ceremony, but she did want to go up and take pictures and say goodbye to her friends before they all disbursed over the country.", "I agree. When I graduated at my own graduation I didn\u2019t see my friends again. Everyone left really quick", "THIS! Was she gonna drag everyone to her car or everyone go out somewhere together? Graduates usually have family and plans. They say goodbye and go their separate ways. Not meet 10 minutes away at someone's car. She should've parked, walked to the place, and called. How weird to sit in a car, then stew about it for days.

OP easily could have responded to the \u201cokay\u201d text with \u201cwhere are you?\u201d and if no response, called the gf.

It sounds like OP was looking for a means to be the aggrieved party.", "I should clarify: SHE drove there, I was car company and I parked the car so she could find out friends. The crowd was huge and her phone had been blowing up all day so I genuinely thought she was having a hard time finding everyone and I didn\u2019t want to overwhelm her with calls and texts, I just trusted her to call me when she had a plan because she told me she would and I had no reason not to believe her", "What does ESH mean?", "He told her a plan and she agreed to it though?", "This is the one", "Sorry I think I got the times wrong - idk when the ceremony officially ended (it went over I think) all I know is when we got there it was over (but the plan was to get there after the ceremony anyways!!)", "Exactly what I thought too. Damn, that's one early graduation ceremony!", "well seem like he can not use his phone so I would say yes he is. he did just sat there like a dog not doing anything ESH", "He was a good boi.", ">but if you had wanted to solve the problem you could have. \n\nI was trying to unpack why this felt like such a clear esh to me and this is why.

I guess ESH because she agrerf to the plan, but the plan was stupid in the first place", "Thank you! Wow - I\u2019m shocked this is not a more common response.

He would be an AH if he had blown up instead of waited for another time to talk about it, although he did the latter. I think the only one acting childish and unproductive is the GF, who clearly lacks common decency. Wasn't a good idea to not call her, but I wouldn't either - I would assume she's probably stressed already because she's trying to find all the friends. I would've waited in the car too, and texted after 30 mins.\n\nYou make a good point though. I find it to be shitty behavior that OP didn't want to drive GF to college graduation, but I don't think it puts him in the wrong.", "No she drove!

This would be a good surprised Pikachu meme lol.\n\nWho goes to a graduation ceremony (preferably on a college campus where people take pictures together) and then decides to hang out at the car? \n\nThat\u2019s why this feels super manipulative. Either that, or OP is dense. Generally, if you want to meet people, you have to like\u2026 get out of the car and go to where they are.", "Pretty much this. Most people at somewhere between 10 -20 minutes would send another text or call. Assuming it was answered, the situation would be resolved and the person in the car would most likely let go of their hurt feelings and accept their partner's apology. \n\nThus is why I'm going with ESH. The girlfriend is totally wrong but he didn't even try to contact her a second time and who knows how clear the plans made even were. Girlfriend's side may be \"he said he'd text me when he found somewhere to park and we'd make plans. He did text but never suggested to join me, so I assumed he was just going to wait.\"", "Ten minutes is plenty for a basic where are you text. Probably not a cussing out though. 10 minutes is plenty of time to decide to just go in.", "She\u2019s not patient, she\u2019s a helpless sack. She easily could\u2019ve texted a second time or just gotten out of the car and found them. She is a big part of the reason she didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to anyone.

But turns out everyone had already left by then", "Yeah, my interpretation of OP's story is that no message meant they would meet at the car afterwards (with OP having texted her the location of the parking space). I don't understand how OP thought it meant don't leave the vehicle until she gave him the location she was. OP absolutely should have followed up with a \"where are you now?\" text. Graduation ceremonies can be busy and it's easy to get distracted.\n\nI feel like this whole situation is a prime example of why things have been rocky lately. I'd expect my partner of 2 years would want to attend my graduation ceremony, not be dragged there.", "This is where I'm at with it, too.\n\nOk, you had a plan.... so what? You also have a cell phone. You see it is absolute chaos. Be proactive.

It\u2019s clear OP saw attending her own GFs graduation as a chore (\u201cI did not really want to go\u201d), and on top of that, it\u2019s somehow her girlfriends fault that she didn\u2019t get out of the car to see their friends? She is an adult - get out of the car and/or call your girlfriend, don\u2019t shift all of the responsibility onto her, especially on a big day she should be celebrated.\n\nThis gives me huge manipulative vibes from OP.

Have none of these people been to a college graduation before? Or a graduation period??? It is absolutely a shit show! There are a million people, going in a million different directions. The expectation that she would enter into that crowd trying to find a bunch of different people, then text you to meet up in the middle of that is absurd! You guys made that agreement but it is completely logical that she didn't reach out given the nature of graduations. After 15-20 minutes a logical person would say, \"wow... there are a lot of people here, no idea where my gf is but I better try my best to find my friends before everything is over.\" Especially If these are your friends too. Instead you sit in the car pouting and wait for her exact location, which mind you is practically impossible to give on a graduation day because you are being shuffled around constantly, then get mad that she didn't stop everything to text you.

Very bad gal!!\u201d but like it\u2019s her graduation day? She very likely got emotional and excited and just all the feelings hit her since she chose not to attend the ceremony.
