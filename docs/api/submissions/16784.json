{"id": 16784, "submission_id": "13cmddr", "title": "AITA for not reminding my girlfriend to come get me after she forgot me in a car for an hour?", "selftext": "\nThis past weekend, my (21F) girlfriend (22 F) decided to make the two hour drive to her University for her graduation ceremony. She had just moved to my town this month, and did not want to go through the whole 4 hour long graduation ceremony, but she did want to go up and take pictures and say goodbye to her friends before they all disbursed over the country.\n\nMy girlfriend asked me to make the drive with her (4 hours in total). I did not really want to go, but we have been going through a rough patch and I thought this would be a good way to spend some much needed time together. Plus, we have been together 2 years, so it was all of our mutual friends graduating and I wanted to say goodbye to everyone and see them all one last time.\n\nSo, we left at 8 AM on a Sunday and made the drive. When we got there, it was chaos. Everyone was leaving the auditorium, and there was a massive crowd. I told her that I would go and find a place to park the car, and she could go find our friends and figure out what the plan was. I told her that I would text her where I parked, and I would stay in the car until she called or texted me to tell me where we were meeting, and if she didn't call me then I would assume that we were meeting at the car, which she agreed to.\n\nSo I parked the car only about a 5-10 minuet walk from where I dropped her off, and texted her where I was. She responded saying \"Okay\" and then I sat in the car and proceeded to wait over an hour. I thought it was weird, but I figured she was just having a hard time finding everyone in the crowd. Plus, I just trusted her to contact me when she found everyone.\n\nWhen she finally gets back, she told me that she found everyone and had been taking pictures and saying goodbye to everyone. She said it was an accident and just got caught up in the confusion of the crowd. I was hurt, but asked where they were and if we were meeting up somewhere. She reluctantly told me that all of our friends had left with their families right after the ceremony, and that they were gone. Some of them out of the country, I might add, so I totally missed my chance to say goodbye to them.\n\nI was heartbroken that she left me out of the plans she had begged me to come to. She knew where I was parked, and she could have easily asked me to meet them.\n\nSeeing as we still have a 2 hour drive home, and it was technically her graduation day, I told her that \"we can talk about this later because I don't want to ruin your graduation day.\"\n\nSo today I was (obviously) in a mood, and she asked me if I was mad at her. I was like... \"Of CORSE I'm mad at you... you left me in the car like a dog...\"\n\nI guess she took me saying \"It's fine we can talk about it later\" as \"Don't worry about it we're fine\".\n\nShe then told me: \"Even though I forgot you, if you thought that then why didn't you call or text me?\"\n\nAITA for not just letting it go? Should I have called or texted her after it had been a long time?\n\nEDIT 1: I should clarify that she drove up, I was car company. I wasn\u2019t sitting in the car to \u201chave a reason to be angry with her\u201d I just genuinely trusted the plan. I wasn\u2019t angry until she came back and told me what had happened. I was happily sitting in the car reading my book and watching tiktoks! \nAlso I did not want to ruin her grad which is why I told her we could talk about it later! After words we got lunch and I have her her graduation present, I just thought we\u2019d talk about it the next day but she seemed to think it was fine now.\n\nEdit 2: I should probably also add that when I said \u201cwait for the plan\u201d\u2019it is because I had no idea if we were all going somewhere after the ceremony, like to get lunch or to go to a park to take pics, or if we were all just going to meet there. My GF didn\u2019t know either so that\u2019s why she went to ask everyone. \nAnd when I said \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to go\u201d it is because I asked my GF to make a plan with everyone beforehand so this exact thing wouldn\u2019t happen, but she was intent on just showing up and playing it by ear. I\u2019m a plan person so things like that stress me out! Also, we have been having problems lately and she\u2019s been ditching me a lot which is why I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to go, but I decided that the 4 hours in the car would be some 1 on 1 time that we really needed! \n\nAlso: I can understand why a lot of people are saying that it was her graduation, and it wasn\u2019t about me, which I totally get! But I should mention was a big ceremony for the graduates in December that I went all out for! I was the photographer, I did her make up and hair, I got her presents and apartment for a little congratulations party! (I did also get her a nice graduation present for this too which I gave her for when we got home and she loved!)", "created_utc": 1683630187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cmddr/aita_for_not_reminding_my_girlfriend_to_come_get/", "score": 2740, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your girlfriend forgot about you and left you waiting in the car for an hour without communicating with you, which was not fair to you. However, you also had the opportunity to reach out to her when she did not contact you after a long time. It's understandable that you were hurt and upset about missing the chance to say goodbye to your friends, but it's important to communicate with your partner in a healthy and constructive way.  \nInstead of holding in your feelings until you were in a bad mood, you could have expressed your disappointment and hurt when your girlfriend returned to the car. You could have asked her why she did not communicate with you and expressed your frustration at missing out on saying goodbye to your friends. By communicating your feelings in the moment, you could have avoided the situation escalating and potentially hurting your relationship further.  \nIn summary, you are not necessarily the asshole for not reminding your girlfriend to come get you, but it would have been more constructive to communicate with her in the moment instead of holding in your feelings until later.  \nRegenerate response", "YTA.

I do find it odd that you were patient enough to wait a whole hour. A simple call or text could have changed the whole experience. \n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering \u2014 is this how things often play out in your relationship? Does she disregard you? Are you passive? Or is this a one-off lack of communication that resulted in an unhappy result for you and everything else is cool? \n\nI\u2019m leaning ESH but I\u2019m afraid that your gf is the real AH.

It\u2019s a 2 hour drive. You would\u2019ve gotten to the venue at approximately 10 am. It\u2019s a 4 hour graduation ceremony. Everyone was already leaving when you arrived. That means that we\u2019re supposed to believe that this graduation started at the latest, 6 am? But the start time would\u2019ve probably been before that if it was a 4 hour graduation, and people were already leaving (chaos) at around 10 am. So if the parking lot was already chaotic at 10 am after a 4 hour ceremony, it means the ceremony\u2019s start time was probably scheduled around 5-5:30 am.

It sounds like OP was looking for a means to be the aggrieved party.", "I should clarify: SHE drove there, I was car company and I parked the car so she could find out friends.

I would've waited in the car too, and texted after 30 mins.\n\nYou make a good point though.

The expectation that she would enter into that crowd trying to find a bunch of different people, then text you to meet up in the middle of that is absurd! You guys made that agreement but it is completely logical that she didn't reach out given the nature of graduations.

I don\u2019t get that. \n\nYou either wanted to be with her, or you didn\u2019t\u2026but you then don\u2019t get to whine about how she spends her time. You don\u2019t get to hold her back from socializing with her friends and expect her to keep inviting you when she already invited you along in the first place.

Plus it was the plan for OP to wait if she didn't hear back. Sure, she could have bugged her gf earlier, but gf is the one who forgot the plan and forgot HER PARTNER who came with her specifically to see their friends. Did she even mention that OP was there with her? How do you say goodbye to your friends without mentioning your partner who JUST went to park your car for you?! \n\nIt may have been a genuine mistake on gf's part, but she still owes OP an apology and some remorse.", "YTA - I\u2019ve been to many graduations before and after a ceremony it\u2019s practically impossible to find your friends and family in the crowd.

If you started walking there, they very well could've been walking to the car and you could have missed them. The gf forgot about you at that moment, plan and simple.

I'd be pissed too and it's nice that you waited instead of \"ruining her day\".", "I'm sorry but the way I read it, you DID text her, and she even texted you back. She just chose not to text back what was agreed upon. Giving an \"okay\" instead of the location like you guys discussed was entirely her fault imo.\n\nShould you have texted her again or called?

On the other hand, it was really thoughtless of your girlfriend to forget you in the car, as you said, like a dog. I do think it was super mature and smart to wait until after your gf\u2019s celebration to bring up your hurt feelings rather than blowing up in the moment or pretending like it didn\u2019t bother you. You should consider all this may be indicative of something deeper, especially since you mentioned relationship problems. It sounds like other than the forced proximity of the car ride, you didn\u2019t spend much time together.

It\u2019s weird that you\u2019re so fixated on that.", "If someone\u2019s late, a quick text to ask for updates won\u2019t hurt", "You stuck to the plan with no communication for an hour? At some point, you need to step up and communicate.", "I mean it can be really hard to find people at a graduation (especially a uni grad) without communication. That\u2019s a lot of people to wade through without know the general area of where they are. If she would have gone in, how long would it have taken to find them? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to take 5 mins to get her gf and bring her back to their friends. I do think OP should have met her at the door", "He'd be sitting pretty while she'd be rounding everybody up, which in this situation would have been like herding cats, with all the chaos. It's her graduation, she was bound to be distracted.", "It\u2019s just a stupid plan, non-communication is not a plan. I agree with the ESH comments.", "You need to get out of that form of thinking.  Circumstances change.  People forget.  If you just assume everything is perfect, don't be surprised when it turns out it's not.", "Did you seriously just try to blame your abysmal communication efforts on being neurodivergent? Really? No, OP. You sat and stayed in that car because you wanted to. Because you assumed that your girlfriend would do all the work corralling your friends together over to the car and away from their families \\*on their special day\\* so that you wouldn't have to put any effort into it. And then when it didn't go the way you wanted, instead of talking it out like a damn adult, you sulked about it and then blew up at your girlfriend out of nowhere the next day, because again, you don't know how to act like an adult. Grow up and do better, and stop acting like you're the victim just because you refused to call your girlfriend on the phone. YTA.", "Okay that's projection pure and simple.", "You think she couldn't have even said, \"Adora_McClain is waiting in the car to see where we are so she can say 'bye,'\" and all their friends would have simultaneously responded, \"Well, I *was* going to spend another half hour with you, but now that you've changed the subject and I know someone else wants to see me, I'm gonna go\"?\n\nAs for the idea that OP was \"waiting and had nothing to do,\" with a smartphone no one \"has nothing to do.\" She was probably playing with the phone, secure in the knowledge that the ball was in the girlfriend's court and all OP had to do was wait.  She didn't mind the wait itself; she minded that having trusted the girlfriend to do what she promised meant that she lost the chance to say goodbye to her college friends before they scattered to the wind.  People here are criticizing her for not being aware that she couldn't trust that promise.  That's understandable after waiting an hour, but it probably wasn't something she was eager to face or acknowledge, especially when they were already in a \"rough patch.\"", "It's just so strange to send someone to figure out what the plan is for something like this rather than going and seeing them yourself. The graduation is the plan! There isn't anything to work out it's just something you join. Make plans before if you want to do more, ya can't just assume more on such a busy event for most people the world doesn't revolve around you.\n\nPrimary reason to go should be to congratulate people and share in their moment as well, I'd be a bit miffed if someone didn't want to come share that moment but just wanted to get the social rush of going out somewhere after for themselves. Missing the ceremony itself is fine but if you actually care then at least show up after where everyone is gathered and give the recognition. It isn't just seeing friends for the last time to the people graduating, it's a significant moment in their lives and you cant get out of the car to share it without more interesting plans in place.", "And OP didn't drive her, but was \"car company.\"", "Nope. It is completely unreasonable to meet way back in the parking lot near the car instead of meeting at \"first/last raw of the chairs/the scene etc\".", "Also, of course the friends all left with their families. That's generally what people do after graduation not hang out with a friend who didn't participate and her girlfriend.", "They're both females btw, but yes??? Even if her phone had been blowing up and OP trusted her Gf to send a text, when after 10 minutes where the Gf KNOWS OP is parked and no sign of her, just shooting a text won't kill either of them??\n\nI'm very confused as to why OP waited for an hour instead of proactively trying to find the GF.", "I\u2019m having some trouble getting your  point. It\u2019s a figure of speech. It\u2019s like saying \u201c X treated me like a dog\u201d, implying that person X mistreated me. We all know you are not supposed to mistreat dogs. But the mental image connected to the simile is pretty poignant regardless", "I\u2019m honestly wondering if the GF told the OP a big fat lie and didn\u2019t actually graduate and get her degree but wanted to see her friends one last time. \n\nA small university\u2019s graduation ceremony starting at 8 am would be unusual but perhaps not unheard of (although I\u2019ve never seen a start time that early with my graduation nor any of my family members). \n\nI\u2019m wondering if GF told OP about a 4 hour graduation ceremony time but told OP she wanted to see her friends one last time before they all moved away. But if she didn\u2019t graduate (flunked out), I\u2019m wondering why she had OP go with her to the venue?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I just know that if OP were my kid, I\u2019d be raising some \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "The OP is the one who posted it and hasn\u2019t corrected it. Why would I assume anything about what OP actually wrote? \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but a \u201c4 hour long ceremony\u201d is not hyperbole. It\u2019s a specific length of time that is not out of the question regarding ceremony times for large universities. And if the OP used it as hyperbole, wouldn\u2019t the OP have included that in the edit or state (in a comment) that it was an exaggeration? \n\nAlso, the OP used the \u201c4 hour long ceremony\u201d as the reason why the GF didn\u2019t want to participate. It\u2019s an integral detail regarding the story. If it were a shorter time (for example, 2 hours), then the reason the GF gave the OP for not participating in the ceremony starts to fall apart.", "A boring one hour can feel like four...", "They both have phones!!!! Did everyone forget how to make a phone call?", "When you tell someone \u201chey you go find X, text me when and where you find them while I park so I can find you\u201d and they agree with it, it\u2019s expected for that plan to be followed.

How many friends did she see? You can easily blow an hour spending 10 minutes finding someone, 5 minutes chatting and saying goodbye, 5 more minutes finding another friend, 5 more minutes saying goodbye, etc. Parents are hovering and are willing to give these small grace windows for goodbyes, but not willing to delay post-grad brunch by an hour. I don't believe that the gf had assembled a group for any length of time that she could have wrangled off to the car. And I don't blame them both for being na\u00efve to how grad ceremonies work, I think NAH.\n\nI also think the friends didn't stick around for any length of time because if they were really mutuals, they would have asked gf where the heck OP was and BOOM a segue to \"oh she's waiting in the car\". The fact that they didn't ask means they were hurried.", "Right? Also, if all the other students were her friends too then she should have phone numbers for everyone and could\u2019ve texted. Literally no way the entire hour this gf sat there just happily thinking the gf was going to come to her. This was passive aggressive. ESH", "That\u2019s exactly what I said! She should have parked and then headed inside herself. She couldn\u2019t expect everyone to walk all the way outside just for her.", "OP said in the comments that her GF did the driving, OP just parked the car.", "Exactly what you said - a bad plan that didn't work.  I'm surprised OP though that all those classmates/friends had the spare time to walk to her just for goodbyes and photos.   She can be upset but learn from the experience.   But GF can do the same and call/text OP to let her know it's mayhem and she needs to come find friends if she wants to see them.  ESH", "Because OP didn't really want to go anyway. She says it herself at the beginning of the text.", "As someone who recently went through commencement at a major university ... I can easily see it taking an hour to find people in the crowd after the ceremony finished and finding a static location to regroup is honestly the best plan (i.e. girlfriend walks around finding friends and says \"OP is parked at the corner of x and y, let me find the others and we'll meet there.", "That was my thought as well. Why would EVERYONE walk back to the car just for her???? How about I park and then we meet at the main entrance or something? Right? That\u2019s what a normal person would do. That did sound a bit strange to me as well!", "In a situation like this I'd share my live location with my partner and expect them to do the same and then one or both of us just head towards their dot on the map", "Yeah, but why let that stop some prick from throwing in an insult.\n\nDoes it actually even matter? It's not like it changes the context.\n\nJeez!", "I used to work for a University that had three separate ceremonies to accommodate the large graduating class size. The Friday ceremony was at 10 but the Saturday ceremonies were at 8:30 and then 2:30. But each ceremony was 2 hours, not four. So something is still...off", "Likely the GF was calling it a 4 hour long ceremony and not OP. Either way nothing is falling apart just because they could be wrong about how long a ceremony they did not attend was possibly supposed to last.\n\nThe length of the ceremony or the length of a ceremony GF didn\u2019t want to sit through is in no way relevant to the actual conflict in the post.", "If someone tells you I\u2019ve parked at a large venue, your reply is just ok?

The departure time from their home was based upon this 4 hour ceremony time, right? The reason the GF didn\u2019t want to participate in the ceremony was due to the 4 hour time frame (what OP told us). So yeah, the 4 hour ceremony time is an important detail, IMO.
