{"id": 16784, "submission_id": "13cmddr", "title": "AITA for not reminding my girlfriend to come get me after she forgot me in a car for an hour?", "selftext": "\nThis past weekend, my (21F) girlfriend (22 F) decided to make the two hour drive to her University for her graduation ceremony. She had just moved to my town this month, and did not want to go through the whole 4 hour long graduation ceremony, but she did want to go up and take pictures and say goodbye to her friends before they all disbursed over the country.\n\nMy girlfriend asked me to make the drive with her (4 hours in total). I did not really want to go, but we have been going through a rough patch and I thought this would be a good way to spend some much needed time together. Plus, we have been together 2 years, so it was all of our mutual friends graduating and I wanted to say goodbye to everyone and see them all one last time.\n\nSo, we left at 8 AM on a Sunday and made the drive. When we got there, it was chaos. Everyone was leaving the auditorium, and there was a massive crowd. I told her that I would go and find a place to park the car, and she could go find our friends and figure out what the plan was. I told her that I would text her where I parked, and I would stay in the car until she called or texted me to tell me where we were meeting, and if she didn't call me then I would assume that we were meeting at the car, which she agreed to.\n\nSo I parked the car only about a 5-10 minuet walk from where I dropped her off, and texted her where I was. She responded saying \"Okay\" and then I sat in the car and proceeded to wait over an hour. I thought it was weird, but I figured she was just having a hard time finding everyone in the crowd. Plus, I just trusted her to contact me when she found everyone.\n\nWhen she finally gets back, she told me that she found everyone and had been taking pictures and saying goodbye to everyone. She said it was an accident and just got caught up in the confusion of the crowd. I was hurt, but asked where they were and if we were meeting up somewhere. She reluctantly told me that all of our friends had left with their families right after the ceremony, and that they were gone. Some of them out of the country, I might add, so I totally missed my chance to say goodbye to them.\n\nI was heartbroken that she left me out of the plans she had begged me to come to. She knew where I was parked, and she could have easily asked me to meet them.\n\nSeeing as we still have a 2 hour drive home, and it was technically her graduation day, I told her that \"we can talk about this later because I don't want to ruin your graduation day.\"\n\nSo today I was (obviously) in a mood, and she asked me if I was mad at her. I was like... \"Of CORSE I'm mad at you... you left me in the car like a dog...\"\n\nI guess she took me saying \"It's fine we can talk about it later\" as \"Don't worry about it we're fine\".\n\nShe then told me: \"Even though I forgot you, if you thought that then why didn't you call or text me?\"\n\nAITA for not just letting it go? Should I have called or texted her after it had been a long time?\n\nEDIT 1: I should clarify that she drove up, I was car company. I wasn\u2019t sitting in the car to \u201chave a reason to be angry with her\u201d I just genuinely trusted the plan. I wasn\u2019t angry until she came back and told me what had happened. I was happily sitting in the car reading my book and watching tiktoks! \nAlso I did not want to ruin her grad which is why I told her we could talk about it later! After words we got lunch and I have her her graduation present, I just thought we\u2019d talk about it the next day but she seemed to think it was fine now.\n\nEdit 2: I should probably also add that when I said \u201cwait for the plan\u201d\u2019it is because I had no idea if we were all going somewhere after the ceremony, like to get lunch or to go to a park to take pics, or if we were all just going to meet there. My GF didn\u2019t know either so that\u2019s why she went to ask everyone. \nAnd when I said \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to go\u201d it is because I asked my GF to make a plan with everyone beforehand so this exact thing wouldn\u2019t happen, but she was intent on just showing up and playing it by ear. I\u2019m a plan person so things like that stress me out! Also, we have been having problems lately and she\u2019s been ditching me a lot which is why I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to go, but I decided that the 4 hours in the car would be some 1 on 1 time that we really needed! \n\nAlso: I can understand why a lot of people are saying that it was her graduation, and it wasn\u2019t about me, which I totally get! But I should mention was a big ceremony for the graduates in December that I went all out for! I was the photographer, I did her make up and hair, I got her presents and apartment for a little congratulations party! (I did also get her a nice graduation present for this too which I gave her for when we got home and she loved!)", "created_utc": 1683630187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cmddr/aita_for_not_reminding_my_girlfriend_to_come_get/", "score": 7223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your girlfriend forgot about you and left you waiting in the car for an hour without communicating with you, which was not fair to you. However, you also had the opportunity to reach out to her when she did not contact you after a long time. It's understandable that you were hurt and upset about missing the chance to say goodbye to your friends, but it's important to communicate with your partner in a healthy and constructive way.  \nInstead of holding in your feelings until you were in a bad mood, you could have expressed your disappointment and hurt when your girlfriend returned to the car. You could have asked her why she did not communicate with you and expressed your frustration at missing out on saying goodbye to your friends. By communicating your feelings in the moment, you could have avoided the situation escalating and potentially hurting your relationship further.  \nIn summary, you are not necessarily the asshole for not reminding your girlfriend to come get you, but it would have been more constructive to communicate with her in the moment instead of holding in your feelings until later.  \nRegenerate response", "YTA.

I do find it odd that you were patient enough to wait a whole hour. A simple call or text could have changed the whole experience. \n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering \u2014 is this how things often play out in your relationship? Does she disregard you? Are you passive? Or is this a one-off lack of communication that resulted in an unhappy result for you and everything else is cool? \n\nI\u2019m leaning ESH but I\u2019m afraid that your gf is the real AH.

It\u2019s a 2 hour drive. You would\u2019ve gotten to the venue at approximately 10 am. It\u2019s a 4 hour graduation ceremony. Everyone was already leaving when you arrived. That means that we\u2019re supposed to believe that this graduation started at the latest, 6 am? But the start time would\u2019ve probably been before that if it was a 4 hour graduation, and people were already leaving (chaos) at around 10 am. So if the parking lot was already chaotic at 10 am after a 4 hour ceremony, it means the ceremony\u2019s start time was probably scheduled around 5-5:30 am.

It sounds like OP was looking for a means to be the aggrieved party.", "I should clarify: SHE drove there, I was car company and I parked the car so she could find out friends.

I would've waited in the car too, and texted after 30 mins.\n\nYou make a good point though.

The expectation that she would enter into that crowd trying to find a bunch of different people, then text you to meet up in the middle of that is absurd! You guys made that agreement but it is completely logical that she didn't reach out given the nature of graduations.

Why leave her to navigate the crowd by herself and do all the work of finding all the friends, while you chilled in the car?  I don\u2019t get that. \n\nYou either wanted to be with her, or you didn\u2019t\u2026but you then don\u2019t get to whine about how she spends her time.

Plus it was the plan for OP to wait if she didn't hear back. Sure, she could have bugged her gf earlier, but gf is the one who forgot the plan and forgot HER PARTNER who came with her specifically to see their friends. Did she even mention that OP was there with her? How do you say goodbye to your friends without mentioning your partner who JUST went to park your car for you?! \n\nIt may have been a genuine mistake on gf's part, but she still owes OP an apology and some remorse.", "YTA - I\u2019ve been to many graduations before and after a ceremony it\u2019s practically impossible to find your friends and family in the crowd.

If you started walking there, they very well could've been walking to the car and you could have missed them. The gf forgot about you at that moment, plain and simple.

On the other hand, it was really thoughtless of your girlfriend to forget you in the car, as you said, like a dog. I do think it was super mature and smart to wait until after your gf\u2019s celebration to bring up your hurt feelings rather than blowing up in the moment or pretending like it didn\u2019t bother you. You should consider all this may be indicative of something deeper, especially since you mentioned relationship problems.

And then when it didn't go the way you wanted, instead of talking it out like a damn adult, you sulked about it and then blew up at your girlfriend out of nowhere the next day, because again, you don't know how to act like an adult.

She didn't mind the wait itself; she minded that having trusted the girlfriend to do what she promised meant that she lost the chance to say goodbye to her college friends before they scattered to the wind.

Grow up, get out the car and call her as she was clearly caught up in stuff", "YTA\u2026 \n\n1. she shouldn\u2019t have to beg you to be arm candy. If you\u2019re tagging along, tag along and don\u2019t be a drag on the situation. Forgot you in the car?? Are you an infant? Do you have no legs? \n2. No one went directly from the ceremony to the airport and flew out of the country lol that was dramatic. \n3. Sounds like she moved to YOUR TOWN and you have the nerve to act like she isn\u2019t showing interest in you. \n4. No one is going to wait for 15 minutes for your to walk from the car to take a pic with them\u2026 graduation ceremonies are chaotic, you see a friend you pose for a pic and you move on. You do that 30 times and then hightail it to whatever special plans your family made to celebrate you. Your GF shouldn\u2019t have had to miss out on those photos and memories just because you wouldn\u2019t leave the car without sOliD pLaNs", "Yta. Get out of the car and walk. This is childish", "ESH but clearly you\u2019re a big kid who could have figured it out and adulted. Use the phone that clearly in you hand while you sat there and scrolled and start walking. Calling and texting would have saved you a lot of grief. You could have solved the problem yourself.", "YTA. At any time you could have called her or messaged her to clarify if she was coming to the car or you were meeting her somewhere else. You *chose* to sit in the car for an hour getting more and more mad instead of being proactive and fixing the situation. If this is the way you deal with conflict and communication no wonder you\u2019re having a \u201crough patch\u201d. \n\nShe didn\u2019t treat you like a dog. You treated yourself like a dog.", "Why didnt you call or text her? I get it you had a plan but she may have got caught in the moment (not saying she was right btw). If it was me, I'd call or text and just ask what's up. I don't get why you just sat there when it had been so long", "YTA. You could have used your legs and your brain, get out and go find her. Stop being a baby.", "YTA just start walking??", "Idk the \u201cand I said if you don\u2019t call me or text me then I assume you\u2019re meeting me at the car\u201d realllly sounds like an added in chunk after the fact to make your side sound better lol that doesn\u2019t even make sense to say in the moment.", "you said you didn\u2019t really want to go and now you\u2019re sad you didn\u2019t get to say goodbyes? nothing stopped you from getting out of the car and seeing things for yourself.", "i feel like you are subconsciously (or maybe consciously) trying to find something wrong here. You said y\u2019all were going through a rough patch, do you think that maybe this incident is being used as a scapegoat for how you truly feel about your girlfriend and the relationship? It seems like you are looking for any small things to make a problem maybe even in hopes y\u2019all will break up, im not sure. but you choosing to stay in the car was pretty silly and so was the original plan. it would have been absolutely nothing to double text or call her to see where she was. \n\nYou almost kind of set her up to fail in this situation as you have agency to call her and check. graduations are incredibly hectic and if you really cared to see your mutual friends you would\u2019ve gotten out of the car and called your girlfriend to find their location.", "\"smart\" is a stretch here lmao", "Reading comprehension literally doesn't exist on this website. You could say \"I walked outside and tripped on my own foot\" and half the comments would say \"Why did you purposely kick a rock?\"", "Yeah both girlfriend #1 and girlfriend #2 should\u2019ve been more communicative generally", "OP runs on planning, gets anxious without planning, but apparently never considered a backup plan for what if plan a doesn't work lmao", "Agreed. I feel like it WOUODVE been smarter for the girls to stick together and find everyone together or for the gf to walk in and they could text and find eachother", "I had a doctor like this as well. You were beyond lucky if you saw them within an hour. I was once there for 3 hours waiting on this doctor. Thank the Lord, I don't have to see him anymore.", "I was hoping somebody would reference Community, thank you", "Having a plan doesn't mean you get to just go brain dead. If my plan is to stay in the right lane on the highway then I come to a lane gridlocked while the left lane is open.. i'm changing lanes. Like wtf lol.", "OP is not an asshole, but rather just ignorant about how graduation ceremonies work. Everyone comes with their parents, partners, other family or close friends from home. There's no reasonable opportunity to meet up as a college friend group right there at the graduation event. She should have just gone in to look around and briefly say hi to people she knew.", "She said herself that she wasn't mad while waiting she just figured it was hectic in there and it was taking a while to find everyone and sort out the plan.\n So I don't think she was looking to be mad because to her the plan was running smoothly. It suddenly wasn't running smoothly when the gf returned and admitted she had Forgotten her.", "OP out here mad about being treated like a dog while also acting like a dog by just waiting in a car.\n\nIf you're a person of planning how in the fuck did you not mentally consider a backup plan? Surely you've heard of Murphy's Law (anything that can go wrong, will go wrong)", "If YOU chose what would have been overwhelming for your gf and YOU chose to spend your time reading, then YOU are at fault here.  Your gf would have been TA if she'd gotten mad at you for calling her 20 minutes into this all since you really should have heard back by then.", "Then why be mad about it?", "So she was already overwhelmed....", "Exactly, if it was 5 mins away and I didn\u2019t get any messages after the, \u2018okay\u2019 I would\u2019ve called and been like tell me where you are so I can come.", "I thought it was a man after reading it \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33 Whoops haha. I think that's only because I assumed only a man would be dumb enough to wait in a car for an hour. Turns out that's not the case lol.\n\nTerrible plan. Use your heads!!\n\nIf that was me and 15 minutes had passed, I would have been calling her asking if she found the friends and where we should meet. Take some initiative.", "Oh, I don't know, MAYBE THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAN", "Idk, it's extremely disrespectful of OPs significant other to just forget about her and not give her an update. While OP does have the agency to contact them, if your significant other forgets you the maybe rethink the relationship.", "OP did text her. The plan was to text her when OP found a parking space & she was supposed to text back where everyone was meeting up.", "Excellent use of a very large word!", "Wow, thanks for the award! I try and keep things simple when I can, but sometimes the long words can be the most apt.", "That's why we got 'em."]}
