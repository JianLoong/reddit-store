{"id": 16784, "submission_id": "13cmddr", "title": "AITA for not reminding my girlfriend to come get me after she forgot me in a car for an hour?", "selftext": "\nThis past weekend, my (21) girlfriend (22 F) decided to make the two hour drive to her University for her graduation ceremony. She had just moved to my town this month, and did not want to go through the whole 4 hour long graduation ceremony, but she did want to go up and take pictures and say goodbye to her friends before they all disbursed over the country.\n\nMy girlfriend asked me to make the drive with her (4 hours in total). I did not really want to go, but we have been going through a rough patch and I thought this would be a good way to spend some much needed time together. Plus, we have been together 2 years, so it was all of our mutual friends graduating and I wanted to say goodbye to everyone and see them all one last time.\n\nSo, we left at 8 AM on a Sunday and made the drive. When we got there, it was chaos. Everyone was leaving the auditorium, and there was a massive crowd. I told her that I would go and find a place to park the car, and she could go find our friends and figure out what the plan was. I told her that I would text her where I parked, and I would stay in the car until she called or texted me to tell me where we were meeting, and if she didn't call me then I would assume that we were meeting at the car, which she agreed to.\n\nSo I parked the car only about a 5-10 minuet walk from where I dropped her off, and texted her where I was. She responded saying \"Okay\" and then I sat in the car and proceeded to wait over an hour. I thought it was weird, but I figured she was just having a hard time finding everyone in the crowd. Plus, I just trusted her to contact me when she found everyone.\n\nWhen she finally gets back, she told me that she found everyone and had been taking pictures and saying goodbye to everyone. She said it was an accident and just got caught up in the confusion of the crowd. I was hurt, but asked where they were and if we were meeting up somewhere. She reluctantly told me that all of our friends had left with their families right after the ceremony, and that they were gone. Some of them out of the country, I might add, so I totally missed my chance to say goodbye to them.\n\nI was heartbroken that she left me out of the plans she had begged me to come to. She knew where I was parked, and she could have easily asked me to meet them.\n\nSeeing as we still have a 2 hour drive home, and it was technically her graduation day, I told her that \"we can talk about this later because I don't want to ruin your graduation day.\"\n\nSo today I was (obviously) in a mood, and she asked me if I was mad at her. I was like... \"Of CORSE I'm mad at you... you left me in the car like a dog...\"\n\nI guess she took me saying \"It's fine we can talk about it later\" as \"Don't worry about it we're fine\".\n\nShe then told me: \"Even though I forgot you, if you thought that then why didn't you call or text me?\"\n\nAITA for not just letting it go? Should I have called or texted her after it had been a long time?", "created_utc": 1683630187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cmddr/aita_for_not_reminding_my_girlfriend_to_come_get/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why don't you? Time to decide.", "ESH - you for assuming she would come find you and sitting like a dog with hands and a phone, in a car, in the hype of the end of graduation amongst crowds, and her for assuming you\u2019d come and find her once you\u2019d parked the car and getting caught up in goodbyes and forgetting her smart dog in the car. \n\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t be choosing this hill to die on. You both could have done better! If you\u2019d wanted to say goodbye too, don\u2019t you think you\u2019d have gone to do that? Or did you expect them to come to you too?", "ESH. \n\nYou both have phones you decided not to use.", "ESH because why would you just wait in the car for an *hour*?\n\nSeriously, you have some agency too.\n\nHowever, she's an AH for just forgetting about you. She used you. She got the ride, and you got nothing.\n\nIt sounds like this 'rough patch' may be the whole relationship. She doesn't think about you at all, and you don't even consider putting in some effort.", "ESH. She was inconsiderate to forget about you. But you are not a dog. You could have sent her a text that you were getting out of the car and would be around. You could have even called her and told her that and met up with her. Instead, you sat in the car and pouted like a child, and made this a much bigger conflict than it needed to be.", "Both of you act like children.\n\nOf course it was her fault to not text you, but if you were waiting and had nothing to do, picking up the phone to make a call would have been easy to do.\n\nI don't really get why you have been waiting in the car in the first place. If you wanted to say goodbye to your friends, you should have attended the ceremony after parking the car, since there was no guarantee that you catch everyone later.\n\nYou better address your relationship issues. Because this shouldn't be a reason for a fight.", "Okay it is a bit shit that she forgot about ya. But dude! Why would you just stay in the car? Did you try to call her? It seems like a silly plan to me to meet at the car if she was at the auditorium where everyone was. \n\nIntention good, execution bad on both parts.", "ESH, sounds like it's a good time to call the relationship quits if your basic communication with each other is this poor.", "ESH. Your gf for forgetting you and not contacting you for an hour. You for being a grown adult that didn\u2019t call her after such a long time. My bf and I could have completed concrete plans down to the last detail but I will still text him to confirm things and check were still in sync. You should\u2019ve left the car and called her to figure out the plan. Staying in the car was just asking for a communication error.", "ESH,  she should have called or texted but I have been at these things and it is mass chaos...most people never see anyone the even recognize. You are perfectly capable of getting out of the car and walking towards her without permission", "ESH. You got ditched, but you decided to remain ditched and not call her. She literally had her phone in her hand taking pictures.", "I have to admit, after ten minutes or so, I would have texted \u201cWTF ARE you???\u201d and then started walking toward the event space.\n\nBut I am not a patient person. You are, and you were, (apparently), just forgotten about! By your GF! And she *asked* you to go with her! And she knew you wanted to say goodbye to these people, *too*! \n\nOhhh. I would be upset.

She stood you up.\n\nSure, there might be an explanation for it, but unless there is a heartfelt apology coming, it's likely to happen again. Just sort of forgetting you, and then playing off your patience as it being okay to walk all over, is not a good path for a relationship to take.\n\nNTA", ">Should I have called or texted her after it had been a long time?\n\n\n\nYea, only because it left you without being able to say goodbye to your friends. But if you had texted and found her you would still be entitled to be upset about her forgetting you. NTA", "NTA\n\nthis is hilarious\n\nwhy are you still with her? she ruined your entire day. and used you as a cabbie for 4 hours. and shes weaponizing it and gaslighting you?\n\nif she even cared about you at ALL she would have wanted you there, and for you to be in the photos. stop being used silly.", "Well you acted like an AH pretty much to yourself on this one. But to me you *purposefully* didn't remind her thinking she was busy, not to inconvenient her. What is a really nice thing to do.\n\nSo feeling bad as consequence of being alone is natural, at this point you could have called her, and justify the inconvenience if need be, by the fact that you were feeling abandoned.\n\nSo, NTA, towards you gf at least", "It sounds like you were both at fault in this situation. Your girlfriend forgot about you and left you waiting in the car for an hour without communicating with you, which was not fair to you. However, you also had the opportunity to reach out to her when she did not contact you after a long time. It's understandable that you were hurt and upset about missing the chance to say goodbye to your friends, but it's important to communicate with your partner in a healthy and constructive way.  \nInstead of holding in your feelings until you were in a bad mood, you could have expressed your disappointment and hurt when your girlfriend returned to the car. You could have asked her why she did not communicate with you and expressed your frustration at missing out on saying goodbye to your friends. By communicating your feelings in the moment, you could have avoided the situation escalating and potentially hurting your relationship further.  \nIn summary, you are not necessarily the asshole for not reminding your girlfriend to come get you, but it would have been more constructive to communicate with her in the moment instead of holding in your feelings until later.  \nRegenerate response", "YTA. If you were a dog (or a small child) you wouldn't have a possibility to change your location, surroundings or evaluate what might have happened (her stopping to talk with friends, getting distracted in it all) and do something about it. You are not a dog. You are 21-year-old human and you could have gotten out of the car and go to find the friends you also wanted to see, check if you maybe see your girlfriend there or get a text from her or something else. You chose to sit in the car because ... why did you stay in the car for an hour, OP?", "YTA - why didn\u2019t you just call her. Makes no sense to me to not communicate then complain. Especially as you said you never told her if she didn\u2019t text you\u2019d \u2018assume\u2019 youd meet at the car. Why would that be an assumption. Id assume you\u2019d come to meet us once you\u2019d parked", "I\u2019m finding it hard to believe she just forgot. Surely, someone said, \u201cHow\u2019s so and so?\u201d which would have reminded her she had a travel partner. I can\u2019t speak for her motives, of course, but I think that needs to be unpacked. I do find it odd that you were patient enough to wait a whole hour. A simple call or text could have changed the whole experience. \n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering \u2014 is this how things often play out in your relationship? Does she disregard you? Are you passive? Or is this a one-off lack of communication that resulted in an unhappy result for you and everything else is cool? \n\nI\u2019m leaning ESH but I\u2019m afraid that your gf is the real AH.
