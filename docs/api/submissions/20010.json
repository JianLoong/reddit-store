My mom (51 F) sister (20 F) and I were obviously heartbroken. My mom was borderline catatonic in her grief. After a brief discussion with my sister , my mom and my grandmother (93 F) we decided to keep news of Dad\u2019s passing contained just to family and close personal friends of my immediate family (dad, mom, sister myself) I believed this to be best to help manage my mother\u2019s stress levels and to help her grieve.  \nDue to my mom\u2019s grief and being the oldest I\u2019ve sort of taken on the role of spokesperson for my family. (Planning the service, dealing with introductory legal work, calling my dad\u2019s friends) So last week I sent a text into the extended family group chat requesting that no one post anything about my dad\u2019s passing on social media and that anyone that we wanted to find out would be informed directly by us. I also made it extremely clear my mom sister and grandmother were on the same page regarding social media.  \nThe service came and went and was obviously extremely hard on my entire family \u00a0especially my mom. Obviously today being Father\u2019s Day was another hard day and we planned a quiet day. However that was ruined by my cousin. She (19 F) decided that in addition to posting a tribute to her dad she posted a message about the loss my dad (her uncle) as well.  \nMe my sister and my mom received a massive influx of calls and texts. Which greatly upset my mom. I was more annoyed that people I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to since high school were now acting like my best friend however the vast majority of my anger was reserved for my cousin.  \nI sent her a text in the family group chat furious at her for ignoring our plainly stated wishes regarding social media and for upsetting my very fragile mom. Her mom (my aunt) retaliated that we can\u2019t control how her daughter grieves the loss of her uncle. She sent one in telling me that (1.I didn\u2019t make it clear the social media ban extended beyond the service 2. Did I expect her to never just talk about her uncle again)  \nI said that it was obvious she was hunting for attention and sympathy. And that if she is not welcome around my mom due to the upset she caused. Pretty much my entire extended family agree that her posting was insensitive. But my aunt and cousin maintain that I overreacted and can\u2019t expect other people to grieve in the same way I did", "created_utc": 1687123951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cvtmu/aita_for_being_furious_that_my_cousin_posted/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your aunt and cousin have some audacity to accuse you of controlling their grief while simultaneously interfering with yours. \n\nThe exact situation you were trying to avoid happened because of your cousin\u2019s lack of consideration for your family\u2019s (entirely reasonable) wishes. At 19, she should know better and your aunt even more so! \n\nI\u2019m really sorry for your loss and I hope you\u2019re given the space to grieve how you need to.", "NTA.

I can appreciate that you're grieving also, but the impact of your post means that my mother has been receiving a lot of calls and outreach that she doesn't want. It has increased her suffering. I did ask the family not to post or discuss Dad's death on social media, and perhaps I didn't make this part clear \u2014 my request stands for as long as Mom's grief is still raw. So, please take down your post, I'd be grateful and I know that Mom will be relieved. Thank you for understanding.*\n\nYou really have to spell it out plainly for most people. And the first hint of anger or bitchiness will put most people on the defensive, making it impossible to have empathy for your position.", "Honestly torn.   You can't dictate how others grieve a loved family member.   But I also don't think you're wrong either.", "ESH, but not for the reason you think. People were going to find out about the passing. It was ludicrous to  believe that your fathers death was going to be hidden. To be honest, it\u2019s amazing that it went that long before people found out.\n\nI understand trying to protect your mother, but if she was that bad the answer was dragging to therapy, not hiding the fact that somebody died. It was never, ever going to work.\n\nI understand that you were looking out for your mom, and you, but JFC it was never going to be successful.", "NTA. My nephew passed and it was very difficult and I wanted to post about it because I basically went MIA for a bit but held off until my brother and sister in law posted online. I followed their lead. Was it my loss? Yes. Did they have a greater loss? Absolutely.", "INFO: why do you want the death of the father essentially kept a secret? I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but I\u2019m struggling to understand why you don\u2019t want people to know.", "INFO\n\nSo is your cousin's mother your dad's sister then?", "INFO: How long was the gag order supposed to last until?", "NTA. Don't post about dead family members when others closer to them (i.e., kids and spouses) are around to see what you say. At the bare minimum, ask before you say anything, especially the first year. I'm not sure why grieving has to be so public; tell close friends, don't blast it to everyone you know on Facebook. Even better! You can set privacy on posts. Set it to a small group only.", "Info: how close was your cousin to your dad?", "Wanting a quiet service was a reasonable ask. You are not TA for that. Wanting ***no contact from anyone*** on Father's Day was also a reasonable ask, but your post gives the impression that ***that*** was a secret plan you didn't communicate to anyone.\n\n>hunting for attention and sympathy\n\nHunting for sympathy is a normal thing people do when sad. Social media is designed to make every social interaction look like a plea for attention.\n\nYTA, because your plan to keep your father's death secret had no clear-cut endpoint when it was OK to talk about him. I seriously doubt your mother's mental state would benefit from random people who didn't know her well talking to her as if he were still alive, although at least they would be more spaced out.", "YTA You can't reasonably expect people to keep a death of a family member a secret beyond the date of the funeral. Just because he was your father doesn't mean you get to police how other people grieve for him.\n\nI would also add that only allowing people directly contacted by you to be aware of his passing is an awful way to treat people who may have been his friends. I have many friends my wife doesn't know and wouldn't think to contact if I died, and vice versa, by keeping it secret you're potentially denying a lot of other people the opportunity to grieve and pay their respect.\n\nGenerally of you send a message of condolence to someone who has lost a loved one you don't expect a reply as you understand that the person is grieving and will have received many many messages from other people, so you and your mother are under no pressure to reply to any within any timeframe. \n\nBe grateful there were so many people who loved your Dad.", "YTA. A reasonable person would assume your request for no social media posts extends to the funeral and not beyond. \n\nEverything your aunt said was right. Sorry your mom was upset but turning around and unleashing all that pain and frustration on your cousin is a total dick move.", "NTA. Yeah, maybe she's grieving, but that doesn't mean that she had to do that. You and your family requested one thing and she didn't respect your wishes.", "NTA. I\u2019d introduce your cousin and aunt to the concept of [ring theory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/promoting-hope-preventing-suicide/201705/ring-theory-helps-us-bring-comfort-in?amp). \n\nIn a crisis, the innermost ring is filled with the people closest to the crisis. That would be your mom, sister, and you.\n\nThe outer rings are comprised of people less close to the crisis in descending order. \n\nThe center ring takes priority. The second ring takes precedence over the third ring and so on, but should offer comfort and support inwards.\n\nTwo weeks is an incredibly short period of time. It is not hard at all to be respectful of a grieving widow\u2019s wishes two weeks out. \n\nIt\u2019s disingenuous of your aunt and cousin to pretend like you were never going to lift the moratorium on social media posts. You\u2019re all just catching your breath for god\u2019s sake. Their inability to see this and their willingness to argue with a grieving widow and her children shows a remarkable lack of empathy on their parts.\n\nI\u2019m so very sorry for you.", "I'm very sorry for your loss.\nAnd I'm sorry to say, but YTA.\n\nI agree with many people thinking that after the funeral, most people would think it's ok to post. I do think she should have added that the family requests privacy at this time though. His death dosnt belong to one person, and unfortunately you can't control what other people do.\n\nIt dosent seem like she did this maliciously. It seems like she's just a kid thinking that's the best way to honor her Uncle.\n\nBut you're asking our opinions on this. Maybe your doing it because you think you'll get validation here, but you're not getting it from me.", "YTA. I get a temporary gag order (I.e. don\u2019t post until it\u2019s been a week or so or until after the funeral), but you don\u2019t get to stop her from grieving forever. Also, it sounds like your instructions were unclear (and were definitely unreasonable). I understand that he\u2019s your dad and your mom\u2019s husband. But he was other things to other people to (like an uncle to your cousin) and those other people get to process their grief and talk about their loss with others.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure your cousin is grieving but right now the wishes of your mum and siblings are important.\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and I hope your cousin understands what a tough time this is right now.", "ESH. There\u2019s a fair chance your cousin mentioned your dad\u2019s passing for a bit of social media attention. But at the same time, it\u2019s entirely unreasonable to try and control all knowledge of your dad\u2019s death, like you\u2019re the board of Samsung, especially so long after the funeral.\n\nBy delaying it, you increased the likelihood of this happening unexpectedly and some on something like father\u2019s day. And if your mum is in such a fragile state and it was so important to have a quiet father\u2019s day, you and she could have turned off/unplugged your phones.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. That must be difficult. You\u2019re grieving, so I think you should be given a pass here. But you should have specified how long you wanted things kept under wraps. \n\nAfter the service had passed, I would\nhave assumed the social media ban was lifted too.\n\nthere\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting some sympathy when your uncle dies. it\u2019s normal to want for support from your friends when somebody passes on. I don\u2019t think your cousin didn\u2019t anything wrong.", "NTA,\n\nYou requested nothing be posted on social media. And she didn\u2019t respect your wishes. This is pretty clear and cut. You have every right to be upset and your aunt and cousin are in the wrong here.  Sucks you have to to go through that, especially because of your mom. \n\nI\u2019d add as well, might be best to not continue to argue though. I\u2019m assuming your mom is unaware what cousin did? She doesn\u2019t need added stress of family arguing amongst themselves", "YTA. It wasn't clear that the request extended beyond the service, so she didn't know. But, what really makes you TA is saying she's hunting for attention. You aren't the only family member grieving. You seem insensitive and controlling. She lost a family member, too.", "NTA\nMy half aunt just pulled this sh!t with me and I absolutely lost it. DM'd her demanding she takes the post down. Called her out for being an attention seeking a*hole. These people will continue to act this way until their bad behavior gets a spotlight on it. Shine away, my friend.\nAlso, I am *so sorry* about your loss and totally understand there aren't words. Keep your dad's memory alive everyday, in everyway you can.", "NTA. You\u2019ve said your piece now take it to the next level and go low or no contact with them. This way they can grieve the way they want and you don\u2019t have to know about it. Unfortunately, you are going to be the one fielding all the calls and extra attention but try to stay strong and help your family through this. Your Aunt and cousin are emotional vampires who will bleed you dry if you allow it!", "NTA... cousin and aunt needs to learn about  boundaries...", "NTA.. the last sentence explains it all. They don\u2019t care about your family and what you are going through they are hoping to have sympathy places towards them and are in fact seeking attention. Unfortunately in my late teens early twenties I did the same. She\u2019ll learn, but she\u2019ll learn a little too late. Im sorry for you loss.", "I hate saying YTA but you are here. You do not know her motives in posting. And yeah how long are people supposed to not talk about it?  It would feel weird I would think to NOT mention a recent father loss in the family. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely valid to wait for everyone who needs to be told to be told without the shock of seeing it on social media. However you are passed that and already had the service even. \n\nAlso a massive influx of calls and texts sounds like many people did not yet know who likely deserved to as well. \n\nYour way of grieving is not the only valid way.\n\nEditing to add - a social media post that included the family is requesting privacy st this time could be helpful to deal with well meaning individuals reaching out. That along with a point person in a sense who can help detour people away from your mom. This was kind of what we did when my dad passed. I don\u2019t love talking about it, I\u2019m not a person who\u2019s comfortable with a lot of it so other people stepped in and kind of helped shelter the immediate family. But all his friends and coworkers, extended family, acquaintances etc they deserved to know as well.", "YTA, not necessarily for the social media ban but for not having a way to inform folks.  In this day and age that can mean social media, but the communication blackout extending so long doesn't strike me as reasonable.", "YTA. Keeping death a secret will only hinder the grief process, not allowing anyone acceptance. It doesn't seem as though you even considered how your fathers passing has affected your cousin. Pain is not exclusive, and everyone deals with it differently. Just because you or your mother hurt does not give you the authority to control how other people manage their pain.", "ESH\nyou can\u2019t gatekeep someone\u2019s death.\nbut she went against your wishes.\nSo sorry for your loss and everything that has come with it.", "It's a difficult time for everybody. Was your cousin wrong in posting on IG? Maybe. But at this point, you can't tell people how to grieve your father or memorialize him.\n\nAre all your cousins' 2500 IG followers strangers or people who knew your father and are reaching out to extend their sympathies? Your father's death will not remain secret for long, anybody not related to the family could have posted it. People's natural inclination upon hearing about a death is to contact the family to express condolences without thinking about whether the family is in any shape to hear them.\n\nYour mother is dealing with the sudden loss of her partner so her emotions ard going to be all over the place. You and your sibling are trying to help your mother while dealing with your own grief. This would have occurred without the IG post.\n\nWhat you need to do now is take a step back and mourn your loss. Don't answer the phone or use social media. Have a relative monitor the phone/social media so you can reach out to people at a later date. I know it's hard now but some people reaching out to you through social media might have stories about your dad that you have never heard and might appreciate knowing. \n\nGrieving a sudden loss is not easy and takes time. The 'firsts' (holidays, birthdays, etc) are always hard. Just when you think that you have a handle on it, you see/hear something that brings you back to square one.

Sending love and healing wishes.", "NTA", "I\u2019m not going to give you an asshole judgment, because I think the situation has too much nuance to break it down into such black and white terms. \n\nIt seems like from some of your comments that what you\u2019re most upset about is that yesterday your mom was doing pretty good emotionally, but today she\u2019s experiencing a lot of pain and having a much more emotional day. It\u2019s easy to blame the social media post and the reach outs she\u2019s had today, but honestly that\u2019s just how grief works. \n\nShe will have days where she feels human, and days where every piece of her being still feels shattered. It\u2019s hard to see your mom like this, and obviously very painful knowing that you lost your dad as well. \n\nDon\u2019t let this pain fester into anger at your cousin, she didn\u2019t make a post to hurt your mother or by extension you. It might feel like a grab for attention, but that\u2019s an unfair assessment. People react differently to loss and use social media for all kinds of different reasons. I don\u2019t think your ask to keep things offline was unreasonable, but I can see how she misunderstood the timeline you were implying. I imagine she felt she was giving him a nice memorial in a way that she felt that she could and in a timeline that she felt was appropriate. Reaching out to ask if the social media ban was still in effect after the service probably didn\u2019t occur to her, because by now his loss has been communicated to so many. Keeping it a secret won\u2019t make the loss hurt any less. \n\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the loss of your father. NAH.", "I think that you are grieving with your mother and close family and that is a terrible thing to have to deal with. It is unfortunate that your cousin posted on social media when you expressed your wishes to her. But I want you to understand that she is also grieving and she\u2019s very young so there\u2019s a part of her that is selfish and what she did. But you need to give it some time so that everyone can get past this terrible event in their lives, and hopefully repair the relationship for the future Because families should always stay together if it\u2019s healthy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her 2,500 instagram follwers are NOT a part of the grieving process and only stressed my Mom out just after she began to get through the day without crying.", "I would think once the funeral has happened, the cat is out of the bag. It\u2019s no longer a secret\n\nYou\u2019re not entitled to control how others grieve indefinitely  OP, you\u2019re being unrealistic. YTA", "So long! His body is still warm! Its been two weeks! I called and spoke to over a hundred people personally. I ensured that everyone who would be reasonably upset by this news was told. If people didn't pick up my phone calls or listen to their voicemail its their own fault.", "Look it is a very very very very reasonable request. No social media. I asked nothing else of my family. They could throw a party at my dad's grave and scream good riddence for all I cared. If my cousin loved my mom protecting her should've been priority 1,2,3,4,5 and 6", "And yet it doesn\u2019t give the cousin the go ahead to blab about it to 2.5k people on an app.", "She disrespected me when I said in no uncertain terms there should be no social media posting regarding my dad. And made it abundantly clear that his wife and both of his children were united on that front.  That is not a complicated request. Just keep my father's name off instagram. He detested social media in life and would want nothing to do with it in death.  She is either A. A moron who can't follow simple instructions or B. Had no sympathy for my mom (her aunt) I can't decide which is worse.", "Yup for the loook at meeeeeee\u2026.feel sorry for meeeeeee clicks and comments. My uncle passed away unexpectedly and without being told, not a single one of us cousins, aunts, uncles posted anything until his immediate family did. There are 2 dozen of us.  It\u2019s actually common courtesy. If the immediate haven\u2019t said anything. You cannot.", "How is it obvious? Other than OPs assertion that it was for attention, there is no other information. It's obvious that OP is angry that his cousin didn't defer to him as the boss of who can share what or where, but other than that, what makes it obvious that it was for internet point? Is it impossible to believe that she shared it as a tribute to her Uncle, whom she loved, and who recently passed away? I mean, when my cousins shared memories of my deceased mother after her passing, I never dreamed of screaming at them and claiming it was for attention.", "I was referring to the calls and texts received by OP, her sister and her mother. They weren't taken by the aunt and the cousin. OP knows the cousin and is in a better position to judge her motives than we are.\n\n>you have no clue that the aunt and cousin also haven\u2019t received a bunch of calls, and in fact they likely did.\n\nThere's no indication that, if this were the case, that they were upset by them. OP and her immediate family were.", "They probably did but she invited that attention when she made the post. My mom on the other hand wanted to spend the her first father's day without her husband quietly but instead because [Ms.Social](https://Ms.Social) Media couldn't look beyond her own wants she was fielding multiple calls and texts from people she hasn't spoken to in years.", "Seriously? She got the sympathy she wanted at the expense of those closest to the deceased, if she really wanted to honor his memory she would\u2019ve shown some respect and restraint. This situation wasn\u2019t about her.", "Required medication by her doctor who is aware of what's going on in her life right now? Was she already on some type of anxiety medication?", "Your mom is equally capable of turning off notifications on her phone for the day. You are being extremely harsh on your cousin and accusatory when she lost an uncle.", "The extended family already knew, so it\u2019s not that nobody knew, just that they didn\u2019t announce it to the public. And the extended extended family and others who were not close to to the deceased have no need to know, especially if they are going to flood the family with well wishes.", "It wasn\u2019t unannounced, not everything needs to be announced on social media.", "Did you text all 200 people not to share anything online?", "So you hate your mom\u2019s side is what you\u2019re saying here to have this much spite. This is deeper than just your cousin.", "So it was supposed to last forever unless you said otherwise? YTA. And I've explained why in my other reply to you. Your grief does not give you the right to permanently control what other people can and can't say on social media. If you wanted nobody to post even after the funeral, you should've explicitly said so. Any normal person would assume it means up until the funeral because that's pretty much when knowledge of your dad's death is \"public\"", "People are allowed to grieve online.", "I'd refer back to the second question The aunt asked. How long is the girl supposed to ignore the fact that her uncle passed? Is she forever banned from mentioning him?", "Like, forever? 3 months? \n\nDoesn't seem like \"keep it a secret forever\" was communicated unless OP forgot to mention it in this post. \n\nOP's done his best to turn his 19 year old cousin into the family pariah over what's pretty obviously a misunderstanding of what he asked. That's not cool.", "So she is only allowed to grieve with family you approve of and she can\u2019t share the news with friends? She likely went a little far, but at this point, keeping her from telling people (and it sounds like she wasn\u2019t supposed to tell anyone you didn\u2019t tell even if it wasn\u2019t via social media) is not within your control.", "I\u2019ll ask then, when was the social media ban to end? Ever?  Because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for you to be mad at people for not know if it\u2019s not clear. I get some peoples posts are annoying. I had people posting about how close they were and what a horrible time this was for them and didn\u2019t even hardly know my dad for example. It\u2019s annoying for sure. But are you saying that random people from your cousins Insta are tracking down your mom and calling/texting her?", "As someone who became a member of the Dead Parent Club at age 16, holy fuck at this comment. \n\nSince you hate social media so much (the irony in you running to Reddit), you need to log off. \n\nThe \u201cstages of grief\u201d are mostly bullshit but right now, you are trying to grieve through anger and you\u2019re only making shit harder on yourself. \n\nYour cousin likely meant well but didn\u2019t fully think it through. It sucks. But you cannot gate-keep grief, even when it\u2019s your own parent.", "You are not her boss, this BS \"she disrespected me\" like you're some sort of mob boss. She is allowed to share her grief at the passing of a loved one, however, and whenever she would like. You don't get to gatekeep simply because he was your father.", "No social media post for how long though? Most people will assume it means until the funeral unless a deadline is given. You can't expect to reasonably have a gag order forever. It's not your place to police what people can and can't post over the course of their lived.\n\nI'm sorry you've lost your dad but it's ridiculous to seriously ban your family from talking about your dad dying with anyone outside of the family.", "She did mess up but as others mentioned how long was she supposed to wait? Was she close to him? It was her uncle. Someone she loved. You can't assume her intentions unless you have previous experience in their department. \n\nI am really sorry for everything you are going through. It's an extremely difficult time. I know you wanted to keep it off of social media but maybe write a post asking for privacy. \nI know it's difficult but try to not take out all of your pain on one person.", "This!! \n\n>It\u2019s actually common courtesy. If the immediate haven\u2019t said anything. You cannot.\n\nOne more time for the people in the back, and One extra special for OP's cousin, as they seem to have trouble getting the message:\n\n>**It\u2019s actually common courtesy.

YOU CANNOT.**", "Did you tell them specifically beforehand to not mention it to anyone?", "OP would have no way of knowing if the aunt and cousin were upset. And I do sympathize that OP and his mom had to deal with this today, but unfortunately this was going to happen sooner rather than later. Although I will concede that based off the size of the cousin\u2019s social media following (OP said it is like 2,500 people) the cousin may have been attention seeking a bit.", "She\u2019s *also* grieving. She waited till after the funeral had passed, how was she supposed to know there was an indefinite social media ban?", "Cousin was capable of not tacking on the bit about OPs father. You are being extremely harsh on OPs mom when she lost the love of her life.", "The extended family AND the father's friends, so the people who would grieve, not the people who would try to comfort the ones grieving, who didn't really want that. People telling their friends/family is 1 thing, posted to social media where the world can know and all the old people you knew in your life flood in to be \"supportive\" is another thing.", "OP doesn\u2019t want anyone to know their dad died and is trying to control who\u2019s allowed to grieve.", "Sounds like they kept the funeral a secret too which is an absolutely selfish AH thing to do.", "She can mention him just not to 2,500 people at once, I was touched by all the texts I received today and replied to each one. She could tell her close friends- very understandable. Social media was our line and the sand, Not a complex or nuanced request.", "Maybe, being a 19 yo, she text OP's mom and find out how Mom is handling it, before causing this kind of anxiety. It would take 2 minutes in the group chat to say \"Hey it's me. I was wondering how Aunt Susie is doing. I want to express my grief with my friends via IG, but I know she is mourning still. How long should we maintain the blackout?\"", "Why would you *ever* feel the need to broadcast the news on social media?", "She could tell friends with the explicit directive that under no circumstances should they contact my mom. Or have their parents show up at our door like one overzealous neighbor did. Sharing the news with her best friend is different than broadcasting it to 2,500 people.", "It is impacting his mom's mental health so that needs to be the deciding factor. And since when did 2500 IG followers translate to \"friends\"? Should all 2500 show up at the graveside service?", "Yes exactly. People who are not attached to us at all are reaching out to my mom because they found out via Facebook and Instagram. I think it would've been reasonable for her to clear it with me first. But I think in six months, my mom will be okay to deal with the conquences of a wide reaching social media post.", "I DID NOT. If she wanted to discuss with friends or a friend that's one thing. Brodcasting it to 2,500 people is another thing entirely. How long- Until I fucking say so how about that . Or if that's unclear text me first.  Since my mom is borderline incapacitated. I'm calling the shots regarding anything related to my dad.", "I'm not taking the pain of my dad's death out on her, HOWEVER my mom getting through yesterday without crying and now today requiring heavy medication. That I unequivocally blame on the stress my cousin caused.", "I would have never given such an order to my family member as even in my grief, I understood that I was not their dictator. I would never dream of demanding that they not mention my mother on their social media until I allowed it. I understood that the loss did not belong to my father, my siblings, and I alone. \n\nI'm sorry for OP'S loss, but I don't believe his indefinite ban was reasonable. I think it is equally reasonable for her to believe that the time for his ban had lapsed, and she was free to share about her Uncle. I understand in his anger and grief, OP has decided to assign a less than kind motivation to his cousin and many on Reddit will pick up the torches and pitch forks along with OP and label the cousin as an evil attention seeking harpy with no real proof. I hope one day he will understand that while his mother, sister, and self were deeply impacted by the loss, they did not and do not solely own the grief.", "Just because someone has a large social media audience doesn\u2019t mean they are seeking attention. \n\nI had a large response online when I posted about a death. I wasn\u2019t looking for likes. I was looking for comfort.", "No, he's trying to control social media posts about it. It is possible to grieve without announcing it on social media", "Because it\u2019s a form of communication many people use", "How is that relevant?", "With all due respect, YTA, I understand your mom is grieving, but that doesn't give you the right to ban others from mentioning your dad or his passing. When my mom passed, most of my cousins were unable to attend the memorial, but they showed their love for her in their post on social media, where they were offered support for their loss by their extended friend group. Make no mistake, they lost someone too. Yes, she was my mom and my father's wife, but she was their family as well. Your indefinite social media ban was an unreasonable stretch.", ">and that anyone that we wanted to find out would be informed directly by us.\n\nThis is a polite way of saying \"don't tell anyone\"\n\nAnd I'm sorry but you don't \"own\" your dad's death. You're his next of kin and you're the ones that arrange everything after his death, yes. But you don't have sole ownership over the fact that he's dead. He's not just your father and your mother's husband, he's also other people's uncle, brother, son, cousin, friend and whatnot.\n\nYou can't reasonably expect people to keep it under wraps forever. His death isn't some family secret you can't let others find out about. Even before social media came out, people would announce the death of their loved ones to people it may concern but weren't able to be contacted or weren't close enough to be personally contact through obituaries.\n\nIf you don't want to deal with the hassle of people expressing their condolences, then you can simply say that you're too busy with your grief to reply. People would understand.\n\nYour dad's passing isn't something people have signed an NDA over. You can't reasonably control what people can and can't say about it indefinitely.", "OP, you are way too much right now and putting yourself into a frenzy. This is VERY unhealthy. Turn off your mom\u2019s phone or answer her texts yourself if her phone is blowing up. Get your mom to a doctor or therapist, if her mental health is sliding. Your cousin made a mistake because you didn\u2019t communicate better about the social media gag order or make your own announcement to prevent this type of response. At this point, it doesn\u2019t matter who did what. You are too angry at the moment. It\u2019s not about your cousin, really, but about your pain at dad\u2019s death and watching your mom fall apart. Like I said, get some professional help before it spirals even worse.", "I can understand that. However, following up and telling people please don't post yet would have been helpful.  She might have thought that she didn't do anything wrong since it's been a few weeks.", "See now that's just hyperbole, no-one called them evil. Disrespectful and insensitive, absolutely.\nAnd let's be clear, they wouldn't have been angry if she would have called a friend of hers to talk it over, but to do it so publicly that it had a real world impact on the direct family of the deceased is really not cool, especially when they have been asked specifically not to.  And I am not even directing this at the cousin, It's just a symptom of people's search for affirmation, whether it's hearts or ticks or whatever.", "Yes, that was what I originally said. I said she may have been seeking attention, but if you read all my comments, OP is wrong.", "There have been obituaries in papers pretty much as long as there have been papers. I wonder if Dad had an obituary or is it just online where we have to keep it a secret?", "Enough that they HAVE to violate a \"please no social media\" request from the bereaved.\n\nNot posting the news is something they're unable to even consider. \"What? No! That's unnatural!\"", "EVERYONE ELSE found no social media to be a reasonable request. I have 30 first cousin's on both sides. Everyone managed to come to the realization that my mom's mental health comes first.", " I've been very open with those who asked about how my mom is doing. BTW same cousin hasn't spoken to me or my sister since the funeral which makes this all the more infuriating. I shouln't need to provide updated guidelines. Everyone else got the memo loud and clear. No social media. If she wanted to clarify that she could've texted me.", "Of course, the only reason to make a public tribute to a loved one is attention, and no one is allowed to do anything but what OP wants because he, his mom, and sister are the owners of the grief over his dad's death. Sorry, no, there was nothing disrespectful or insensitive about sharing a loving tribute to her uncle.", "Ok but you\u2019re saying it\u2019s attention seeking to post about a family death and I\u2019m being downvoted for saying I shared about a death lol\n\nReddit is wild.", "I have no idea, I'm not OP. Ask him. I can tell you my own similar experience, my brother died earlier this year and my parents asked for no social media posts and also didn't do an obituary. I respected their choice because they were grieving the loss of a child and I wanted to do whatever possible to make that easier for them. I did however tell all my friends irl and received all the support I needed in actual conversation, not likes", "I didn\u2019t say that. The question was why would you ever. And that\u2019s why. I think not giving an until date can\u2019t be discounted here and that the cousin very may well have thought it was just till the funeral etc. I think OP has a right to feel hurt. I don\u2019t think they have a right to lash out and assume it\u2019s all about attention etc.", ">EVERYONE ELSE found no social media to be a reasonable request\n\nAnd? Everyone's different. I wouldn't post either. Not because of your request, which is frankly ridiculous, but because I don't like posting personal stuff online. Most people don't, but some people are different and that's okay. Just because other people didn't post doesn't mean they found your request reasonable. They may think it's a load of crap to permanently ban people from posting, but they just wouldn't post regardless of your blessings because they don't like to do it.\n\n>Everyone managed to come to the realization that my mom's mental health comes first.\n\nUnless everyone's getting constant updates on your mother's mental health or are seeing her in person, you can't expect everyone to have perfect knowledge of her state. Most people would still be grieving so soon after the death of a loved one but would be okay with social media posts. \n\nOfc I'm not faulting your mother for it. I'm saying that unless everyone knew where your mother was at mentally and how a social media post would affect her, you can't expect people to constantly keep her in mind.", "I don't know you personal family dynamics or her so I can;t say much. Your feelings are valid and you aren't an AH for your feelings.\n\nIs the situation a bit more complicated ?  Yes.", "Again I am very sorry for your loss and how difficult this is. I hope things get better for your mom.", "I was downvoted too. And honestly I was just conceding slightly that she may have had some attention seeking motives. However, people grieve differently and it is possible that her motives were entirely pure.", "Is there anything about facebook that *isn't* about attention?", "I mean if you are not differentiating bringing attention to or getting attention for myself - I guess. I used social media exclusively to keep people updated when my dad was sick and eventually passed. It was to let people know but to also give me my own personal space to grieve without people having a million questions etc.  People could judge that as attention seeking - it\u2019s not."]}
