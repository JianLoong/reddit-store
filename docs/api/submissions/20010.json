My mom (51 F) sister (20 F) and I were obviously heartbroken. My mom was borderline catatonic in her grief. After a brief discussion with my sister , my mom and my grandmother (93 F) we decided to keep news of Dad\u2019s passing contained just to family and close personal friends of my immediate family (dad, mom, sister myself) I believed this to be best to help manage my mother\u2019s stress levels and to help her grieve.  \nDue to my mom\u2019s grief and being the oldest I\u2019ve sort of taken on the role of spokesperson for my family. (Planning the service, dealing with introductory legal work, calling my dad\u2019s friends) So last week I sent a text into the extended family group chat requesting that no one post anything about my dad\u2019s passing on social media and that anyone that we wanted to find out would be informed directly by us. I also made it extremely clear my mom sister and grandmother were on the same page regarding social media.  \nThe service came and went and was obviously extremely hard on my entire family \u00a0especially my mom. Obviously today being Father\u2019s Day was another hard day and we planned a quiet day. However that was ruined by my cousin. She (19 F) decided that in addition to posting a tribute to her dad she posted a message about the loss my dad (her uncle) as well.  \nMe my sister and my mom received a massive influx of calls and texts. Which greatly upset my mom. I was more annoyed that people I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to since high school were now acting like my best friend however the vast majority of my anger was reserved for my cousin.  \nI sent her a text in the family group chat furious at her for ignoring our plainly stated wishes regarding social media and for upsetting my very fragile mom. Her mom (my aunt) retaliated that we can\u2019t control how her daughter grieves the loss of her uncle. She sent one in telling me that (1.I didn\u2019t make it clear the social media ban extended beyond the service 2. Did I expect her to never just talk about her uncle again)  \nI said that it was obvious she was hunting for attention and sympathy. And that if she is not welcome around my mom due to the upset she caused. Pretty much my entire extended family agree that her posting was insensitive. But my aunt and cousin maintain that I overreacted and can\u2019t expect other people to grieve in the same way I did", "created_utc": 1687123951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cvtmu/aita_for_being_furious_that_my_cousin_posted/", "score": 4623, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your aunt and cousin have some audacity to accuse you of controlling their grief while simultaneously interfering with yours. \n\nThe exact situation you were trying to avoid happened because of your cousin\u2019s lack of consideration for your family\u2019s (entirely reasonable) wishes. At 19, she should know better and your aunt even more so! \n\nI\u2019m really sorry for your loss and I hope you\u2019re given the space to grieve how you need to.", "NTA.

I can appreciate that you're grieving also, but the impact of your post means that my mother has been receiving a lot of calls and outreach that she doesn't want. It has increased her suffering. I did ask the family not to post or discuss Dad's death on social media, and perhaps I didn't make this part clear \u2014 my request stands for as long as Mom's grief is still raw. So, please take down your post, I'd be grateful and I know that Mom will be relieved. Thank you for understanding.*\n\nYou really have to spell it out plainly for most people. And the first hint of anger or bitchiness will put most people on the defensive, making it impossible to have empathy for your position.", "Honestly torn.   You can't dictate how others grieve a loved family member.   But I also don't think you're wrong either.", "ESH, but not for the reason you think. People were going to find out about the passing. It was ludicrous to  believe that your fathers death was going to be hidden. To be honest, it\u2019s amazing that it went that long before people found out.\n\nI understand trying to protect your mother, but if she was that bad the answer was dragging to therapy, not hiding the fact that somebody died. It was never, ever going to work.\n\nI understand that you were looking out for your mom, and you, but JFC it was never going to be successful.", "NTA. My nephew passed and it was very difficult and I wanted to post about it because I basically went MIA for a bit but held off until my brother and sister in law posted online. I followed their lead. Was it my loss? Yes. Did they have a greater loss? Absolutely.", "INFO: why do you want the death of the father essentially kept a secret? I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but I\u2019m struggling to understand why you don\u2019t want people to know.", "INFO\n\nSo is your cousin's mother your dad's sister then?", "INFO: How long was the gag order supposed to last until?", "NTA. Don't post about dead family members when others closer to them (i.e., kids and spouses) are around to see what you say. At the bare minimum, ask before you say anything, especially the first year. I'm not sure why grieving has to be so public; tell close friends, don't blast it to everyone you know on Facebook. Even better! You can set privacy on posts. Set it to a small group only.", "Info: how close was your cousin to your dad?", "Wanting a quiet service was a reasonable ask. You are not TA for that. Wanting ***no contact from anyone*** on Father's Day was also a reasonable ask, but your post gives the impression that ***that*** was a secret plan you didn't communicate to anyone.\n\n>hunting for attention and sympathy\n\nHunting for sympathy is a normal thing people do when sad. Social media is designed to make every social interaction look like a plea for attention.\n\nYTA, because your plan to keep your father's death secret had no clear-cut endpoint when it was OK to talk about him. I seriously doubt your mother's mental state would benefit from random people who didn't know her well talking to her as if he were still alive, although at least they would be more spaced out.", "YTA You can't reasonably expect people to keep a death of a family member a secret beyond the date of the funeral. Just because he was your father doesn't mean you get to police how other people grieve for him.\n\nI would also add that only allowing people directly contacted by you to be aware of his passing is an awful way to treat people who may have been his friends. I have many friends my wife doesn't know and wouldn't think to contact if I died, and vice versa, by keeping it secret you're potentially denying a lot of other people the opportunity to grieve and pay their respect.\n\nGenerally of you send a message of condolence to someone who has lost a loved one you don't expect a reply as you understand that the person is grieving and will have received many many messages from other people, so you and your mother are under no pressure to reply to any within any timeframe. \n\nBe grateful there were so many people who loved your Dad.", "YTA. A reasonable person would assume your request for no social media posts extends to the funeral and not beyond. \n\nEverything your aunt said was right. Sorry your mom was upset but turning around and unleashing all that pain and frustration on your cousin is a total dick move.", "NTA. Yeah, maybe she's grieving, but that doesn't mean that she had to do that. You and your family requested one thing and she didn't respect your wishes.", "NTA. I\u2019d introduce your cousin and aunt to the concept of [ring theory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/promoting-hope-preventing-suicide/201705/ring-theory-helps-us-bring-comfort-in?amp). \n\nIn a crisis, the innermost ring is filled with the people closest to the crisis. That would be your mom, sister, and you.\n\nThe outer rings are comprised of people less close to the crisis in descending order. \n\nThe center ring takes priority. The second ring takes precedence over the third ring and so on, but should offer comfort and support inwards.\n\nTwo weeks is an incredibly short period of time. It is not hard at all to be respectful of a grieving widow\u2019s wishes two weeks out. \n\nIt\u2019s disingenuous of your aunt and cousin to pretend like you were never going to lift the moratorium on social media posts. You\u2019re all just catching your breath for god\u2019s sake. Their inability to see this and their willingness to argue with a grieving widow and her children shows a remarkable lack of empathy on their parts.\n\nI\u2019m so very sorry for you.", "I'm very sorry for your loss.\nAnd I'm sorry to say, but YTA.\n\nI agree with many people thinking that after the funeral, most people would think it's ok to post. I do think she should have added that the family requests privacy at this time though. His death dosnt belong to one person, and unfortunately you can't control what other people do.\n\nIt dosent seem like she did this maliciously. It seems like she's just a kid thinking that's the best way to honor her Uncle.\n\nBut you're asking our opinions on this. Maybe your doing it because you think you'll get validation here, but you're not getting it from me.", "YTA. I get a temporary gag order (I.e. don\u2019t post until it\u2019s been a week or so or until after the funeral), but you don\u2019t get to stop her from grieving forever. Also, it sounds like your instructions were unclear (and were definitely unreasonable). I understand that he\u2019s your dad and your mom\u2019s husband. But he was other things to other people to (like an uncle to your cousin) and those other people get to process their grief and talk about their loss with others.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure your cousin is grieving but right now the wishes of your mum and siblings are important.\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and I hope your cousin understands what a tough time this is right now.", "ESH. There\u2019s a fair chance your cousin mentioned your dad\u2019s passing for a bit of social media attention. But at the same time, it\u2019s entirely unreasonable to try and control all knowledge of your dad\u2019s death, like you\u2019re the board of Samsung, especially so long after the funeral.\n\nBy delaying it, you increased the likelihood of this happening unexpectedly and some on something like father\u2019s day. And if your mum is in such a fragile state and it was so important to have a quiet father\u2019s day, you and she could have turned off/unplugged your phones.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. That must be difficult. You\u2019re grieving, so I think you should be given a pass here. But you should have specified how long you wanted things kept under wraps. \n\nAfter the service had passed, I would\nhave assumed the social media ban was lifted too.\n\nthere\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting some sympathy when your uncle dies. it\u2019s normal to want for support from your friends when somebody passes on. I don\u2019t think your cousin didn\u2019t anything wrong.", "NTA,\n\nYou requested nothing be posted on social media. And she didn\u2019t respect your wishes. This is pretty clear and cut. You have every right to be upset and your aunt and cousin are in the wrong here.  Sucks you have to to go through that, especially because of your mom. \n\nI\u2019d add as well, might be best to not continue to argue though. I\u2019m assuming your mom is unaware what cousin did? She doesn\u2019t need added stress of family arguing amongst themselves", "YTA. It wasn't clear that the request extended beyond the service, so she didn't know. But, what really makes you TA is saying she's hunting for attention. You aren't the only family member grieving. You seem insensitive and controlling. She lost a family member, too.", "NTA\nMy half aunt just pulled this sh!t with me and I absolutely lost it. DM'd her demanding she takes the post down. Called her out for being an attention seeking a*hole. These people will continue to act this way until their bad behavior gets a spotlight on it. Shine away, my friend.\nAlso, I am *so sorry* about your loss and totally understand there aren't words. Keep your dad's memory alive everyday, in everyway you can.", "NTA. You\u2019ve said your piece now take it to the next level and go low or no contact with them. This way they can grieve the way they want and you don\u2019t have to know about it. Unfortunately, you are going to be the one fielding all the calls and extra attention but try to stay strong and help your family through this. Your Aunt and cousin are emotional vampires who will bleed you dry if you allow it!", "NTA... cousin and aunt needs to learn about  boundaries...", "NTA.. the last sentence explains it all. They don\u2019t care about your family and what you are going through they are hoping to have sympathy places towards them and are in fact seeking attention. Unfortunately in my late teens early twenties I did the same. She\u2019ll learn, but she\u2019ll learn a little too late. Im sorry for you loss.", "I hate saying YTA but you are here. You do not know her motives in posting. And yeah how long are people supposed to not talk about it?  It would feel weird I would think to NOT mention a recent father loss in the family. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely valid to wait for everyone who needs to be told to be told without the shock of seeing it on social media. However you are passed that and already had the service even. \n\nAlso a massive influx of calls and texts sounds like many people did not yet know who likely deserved to as well. \n\nYour way of grieving is not the only valid way.\n\nEditing to add - a social media post that included the family is requesting privacy st this time could be helpful to deal with well meaning individuals reaching out. That along with a point person in a sense who can help detour people away from your mom. This was kind of what we did when my dad passed. I don\u2019t love talking about it, I\u2019m not a person who\u2019s comfortable with a lot of it so other people stepped in and kind of helped shelter the immediate family. But all his friends and coworkers, extended family, acquaintances etc they deserved to know as well.", "YTA, not necessarily for the social media ban but for not having a way to inform folks.  In this day and age that can mean social media, but the communication blackout extending so long doesn't strike me as reasonable.", "YTA. Keeping death a secret will only hinder the grief process, not allowing anyone acceptance. It doesn't seem as though you even considered how your fathers passing has affected your cousin. Pain is not exclusive, and everyone deals with it differently. Just because you or your mother hurt does not give you the authority to control how other people manage their pain.", "ESH\nyou can\u2019t gatekeep someone\u2019s death.\nbut she went against your wishes.\nSo sorry for your loss and everything that has come with it.", "It's a difficult time for everybody. Was your cousin wrong in posting on IG? Maybe. But at this point, you can't tell people how to grieve your father or memorialize him.\n\nAre all your cousins' 2500 IG followers strangers or people who knew your father and are reaching out to extend their sympathies? Your father's death will not remain secret for long, anybody not related to the family could have posted it. People's natural inclination upon hearing about a death is to contact the family to express condolences without thinking about whether the family is in any shape to hear them.\n\nYour mother is dealing with the sudden loss of her partner so her emotions ard going to be all over the place. You and your sibling are trying to help your mother while dealing with your own grief. This would have occurred without the IG post.\n\nWhat you need to do now is take a step back and mourn your loss. Don't answer the phone or use social media. Have a relative monitor the phone/social media so you can reach out to people at a later date. I know it's hard now but some people reaching out to you through social media might have stories about your dad that you have never heard and might appreciate knowing. \n\nGrieving a sudden loss is not easy and takes time. The 'firsts' (holidays, birthdays, etc) are always hard. Just when you think that you have a handle on it, you see/hear something that brings you back to square one.

The social media post is just making it about them and getting people to feel badly for them. It\u2019s obnoxious. \nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I\u2019ve been there. Sending love and healing wishes.", "NTA", "I\u2019m not going to give you an asshole judgment, because I think the situation has too much nuance to break it down into such black and white terms. \n\nIt seems like from some of your comments that what you\u2019re most upset about is that yesterday your mom was doing pretty good emotionally, but today she\u2019s experiencing a lot of pain and having a much more emotional day. It\u2019s easy to blame the social media post and the reach outs she\u2019s had today, but honestly that\u2019s just how grief works. \n\nShe will have days where she feels human, and days where every piece of her being still feels shattered. It\u2019s hard to see your mom like this, and obviously very painful knowing that you lost your dad as well. \n\nDon\u2019t let this pain fester into anger at your cousin, she didn\u2019t make a post to hurt your mother or by extension you. It might feel like a grab for attention, but that\u2019s an unfair assessment. People react differently to loss and use social media for all kinds of different reasons. I don\u2019t think your ask to keep things offline was unreasonable, but I can see how she misunderstood the timeline you were implying. I imagine she felt she was giving him a nice memorial in a way that she felt that she could and in a timeline that she felt was appropriate. Reaching out to ask if the social media ban was still in effect after the service probably didn\u2019t occur to her, because by now his loss has been communicated to so many. Keeping it a secret won\u2019t make the loss hurt any less. \n\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the loss of your father. NAH.", "I think that you are grieving with your mother and close family and that is a terrible thing to have to deal with. It is unfortunate that your cousin posted on social media when you expressed your wishes to her. But I want you to understand that she is also grieving and she\u2019s very young so there\u2019s a part of her that is selfish and what she did. But you need to give it some time so that everyone can get past this terrible event in their lives, and hopefully repair the relationship for the future Because families should always stay together if it\u2019s healthy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s very sad that your father passed! but he wasn\u2019t just a father, a son and a husband. he WAS an uncle too, he was a friend, he was a brother and maybe more. \n\nhere is my story: for me my aunts sudden death was one of the most extreme things that happened in my life so far. I was 28, quite old already, but she was the first person in my life that died that I loved that dearly. I had never experienced such a feeling before. I know you learn young about death but for me it was then that I actually got to learn how it feels, what it means, and that it is real. Sound silly but this was entirely new and shocking for me. The first week was intense. In retrospective, I think I might even had some sort of psychosis. I lost my connection to reality (I don\u2019t want to go into d tail about this week for me though) It was surreal. The following weeks it got better but I I was still not just in grieve but in a state of shock. I cried a lot, about her and also this Realisation of death. It took me a while hole year to get back to normal I\u2019d say.I did also think about my cousin a lot, her daughter. We are only one year apart, i could feel her paun kilometets away it seemed\u2026 we did text and I had the feeling (still do) that it did actually help her that we exchanged our thoughts and feelings, she knows I loved her mom so much, and I couldn\u2019t even yet imagine how much more pain I\u2019d feel if it was my own mother\u2026. My family held together strong, we are all very close and I think it brought us together even closer (especially after corona making it difficult for us to be together before that)\n\nthat being said, I didn\u2019t post on social media, but that\u2019s not something i do ever about personal topics. I don\u2019t think you though that you are being fair in pointing at your cousin calling her attention seeking only on the Internet. it seems you are dismissing entirely what the death of your father did to her, too. Death as a whole. Maybe she wasn\u2019t even thinking rational. maybe she just needed support too?\n\nI understand you are in pain.and two weeks no posting all that that is totally reasonable of you. But I don\u2019t think you have any right to express your furiosity about someone posting about it online. that\u2019s not fair and honestly quite inconsiderate of other people. it\u2019s a world of the www - for some people that means a lot. \n\n This was long but after reading so many comments on this and that, I wanted to bring into the conversation a hopeful new perspective for you on how other people who are not child, parent or souse of a dead person can experience the death of a loved person. I know you feel pain, but she does too maybe. Are you more in pain than she? Maybe, but the pain she is feeling is the most she feels right now too, it\u2019s not fair to compare them and put them on a scale. everybody\u2019s pain is still a huge thing for each person. you want her to be understanding and considerate if your feelings. But you aren\u2019t anything than criticism of her, accusing her of not actually feeling anything and only oooking for attention. That is not fair. I think in seats you should hold together more and except that different people experience things differently and act differently. Group hug\n\nNAH", "NAH.

I am surprised that the funeral home didn't post an obituary, as they usually do. But I also wonder about this great need for so much secrecy. Was there some greater need than just your mom's feelings for keeping his death such a secret? I also wonder how it was that you called everyone you could think of, had a funeral with 200 people, and there were STILL enough people who didn't know that your mom was flooded with phone calls and even had 2 people who felt they were close enough with her that they dropped by to pay their respects. \n\nAt this point, the cat is out of the bag, and you're not going to be able to put it back in. I think the best you can do if your cousin refuses to take down her post is to make a new post asking people to please respect your family's privacy and need to grieve in peace at this time.

I can understand very much that you are trying to protect her. but controlling other relatives (online) seeking of support/compassion (attention seeking would be the last thing that came to my mind tbh at least I imagine my cousins doing that when my mom or dad would die) is not something that will solve anything.

I understand it a hard, being reminded with ever call and text that this is reality. but it IS reality. it might be really a good idea to not open message / answer calls. And of Tragst\u00fchle much just turn off the phone for some time. but you shouldn\u2019t dismiss that your father wa sliced by others as well, differently by everyone. you cannot dictate to others in pain how to handle this thing that is happening rn to them too. You want to protect z your mom, that is good. but you must find another way because this is not the right way. two weeks no social media was ver reasonable (also that\u2019s how it sounded for me too in that text.) and it Summe everyone happily respected that. But it\u2019s just not possible or in any form to put rules on other family members in pain on how/where/who to speak up about it.

I don\u2019t want to pass judgement because so many people must be grieving and it is hard to know how the loss affected your extended family and old friends etc. When my brother-in- law passed away unexpectedly, many of us were deeply affected and missed him immediately, my daughter included. He had been a part of our lives since she was an infant. Depending on the age of your niece, it might feel natural to post on social media to share with the world her feelings about your dad and seek support for her loss. Many people out there use social media for support and to express their feelings and it is possible she felt she was honoring your dad. It is not uncommon. When my mother died, I didn\u2019t personally post anything about it, but many many people do post stuff like that and consider it normal. Also, when my old friends pass away, I usually get a phone call, but there were times when someone I loved and who were a big part of my life years ago died and I found out on social media. I still grieved for their loss, and wished there was something more I could do for their immediate family while honoring their memory in my own heart. I still miss the ones I have lost. I still loved those people I knew from years ago. I\u2019m sorry for your mom. I can understand her need for privacy, and yours too.

It\u2019s gross either way but I feel like it\u2019s worse for his sister in law", "I also have a cousin like this. She was the last to know when my grandmother passed because she posted it immediately to Facebook. Which is really freaking annoying because it's hard to control comments and traffic coming in when you're just overwhelmed.", "That is disgusting.

My mom called one sister (sister a), told her the news, and asked her to please wait to make any social media posts so she could tell my other sister (sister b) personally.

If I had a relationship with my dad, and he suddenly passed, and we had the funeral with the same requests prior, and then a cousin posted a tribute on father's day? I'd be a little annoyed at the unwanted influx, but that could be her way of greiving and you have no right to dictate that.   \n\n\nMy mom's adoptive father passed in 1998 just a week before my brother was born, and my mom or my aunt still post a tribute to him every year either on his birthday or father's day. It's recent, it hurts, but recency creates bias. You handled the service prep, so you and your other family members have a clear bias about the situation. Your 19f cousin doesn't have the same bias. Any normal person in this situation would think that the request extended only until the service date, and it is very normal to post a tribute to a deceased father figure on father's day.", "I agree OP, and I'm glad your there to help your Mom through this. \n\nNTA, not by a country mile.", "I don't get it either, but it is a thing that people do for some reason.

Which is exactly what happened when the cousin posted about it. It can be a bigger burden than people realize.\n\nAlso, the reach of a Facebook announcement =/= verbal communication with friends and family. A Facebook post gets liked and shared and reaches friends of friends, hence what OP said about people they hadn't seen since high-school messaging them. No way would that news have reached all those people without social media being involved, meaning there's a few shades of gray between \"secret\" and \"blasted on fb\"", "We all grieve differently. OP's Mom apparently took it really hard and needed more time to get into a better mindset before letting the world know.", "That's all \"posting a tribute\" is about, really.

I think his dad just died, his mom has fallen apart and he's trying to be the man of the house and can't control anything. And I don't say that in a horrible mean way, grief doesn't come with instructions especially if it's the first parent you have lost. But the logic of keeping mom mildly sedated and not having contact with the outside world by keeping everything a secret isn't going to make anyone's grief any better or shorter. I feel bad for him, It doesn't sound like he has any support or people he can talk to despite purposely telling over 200 people", "You hit what I was thinking. I feel for everyone in this situation. I lost my father suddenly and unexpectedly as a child. EVERYTHING was overwhelming. Suddenly everyone seemed to \"be there for us\" yet most of the time I just wanted to stare at a wall. It\u2019s natural for people to grieve very differently. What\u2019s not jiving for me is OP\u2019s projection onto the cousin, and that\u2019s where I think you hit it: the cousin is just an outlet for some of OP\u2019s grief and loss. We don\u2019t know the cousin\u2019s motives. Maybe she thought two weeks was enough. And plenty of people derive solace and healing from tributes to loved ones. It\u2019s not like that for me, but I can\u2019t judge someone else\u2019s grief. \n\nMost importantly, blaming her for outside communications isn\u2019t sensible. People will find out the news no matter what, if not this week, next week or next month. Maybe OP can help Mom formulate a strategy.

Those are big punches in the gut. Recovering from them is complicated. You seem to think that rules about who can say what to whom will make it less complicated, but grief doesn't work that way. It's going to hit you over and over again when you least expect it, but finally you'll make an uneasy peace with your loss\u2014or, to put it another way, you'll settle into your grief.

If you wanted to control the narrative, you should have posted a tribute yourself, with considerations for your mom mentioned and directions on how to leave condolences but otherwise allow space - and then allow that post to be shared by family.

Once we'd done that, we posted the obituary on social media, feeling confident that nobody was going to be blindsided by finding out about it online. That was FIVE YEARS AGO and somehow there are still people who didn't get the memo. Every year on his birthday, we have people posting on his FB page wishing him well, and by the content of their messages, you can tell they clearly do not know he's passed. My sister has even texted me going, \"This is awkward. Do we tell them?\" And it's always someone we don't really know. My dad knew a TON of people. He had a lot of friends. Was beloved by coworkers going back to his youth. Even had old Army buddies who would reach out to him every few years (and he served in the Army in the 60s). We basically called every single person in his phone contacts plus anyone else we could think of, and somehow some people still didn't find out. \n\nI think someone saying something to the mom and not knowing her husband had died would be worse because then she'd have to tell them. And oh my God, notifying people was fucking horrible when my dad went and we'd had a little bit of time to prepare ourselves (he went into hospice less than a week before he died but had been sick on and off for years). I hope to never have to make notifications like that again.\n\nI understand where OP is coming from but I still think his anger is misplaced, and lashing out at family isn't going to make anything better right now and is just adding to the pain and stress. A message saying, \"hey, I asked you not to do that\" would be fine but being enraged is useless. And I can kind of see why someone might assume that it was OK to post after the funeral. I wouldn't do it (I would never post  about an aunt/uncle's death anyway), but I get it. I'm still haunted by the time my friend's husband sent me a cryptic FB message with my friend's name as the subject and it just said \"call me as soon as you see this.\" That friend had recently given birth, and I damn near had a panic attack when I saw it. It was indeed bad news \u2014 the friend's mom had died \u2014 but my friend herself was OK, and the way her husband had phrased it terrified me (a few friends who had gotten the same message called me later and all said it had completely made them panic as well, so it wasn't just me). So I hate the idea of notifying someone of a death electronically anyway, but I get that some people use that medium nonstop.\n\nMom could have muted her phone after receiving the first text if it was that triggering for her.

Enough to say hello, wave and maybe offer a few pleasantries. But he appreciated my dad's friendliness. Said he was a kind man, and that he looked forward to seeing him. He was a pleasant and familiar face along his route. Said he heard about our mom and that he felt like he should stop and say something and let us know how much he liked our parents.\n\nI suppose I should have been outraged because he didn't know us well enough to offer condolences or apparently intrude upon our grief.
