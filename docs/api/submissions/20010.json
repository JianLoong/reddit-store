My mom (51 F) sister (20 F) and I were obviously heartbroken. My mom was borderline catatonic in her grief. After a brief discussion with my sister , my mom and my grandmother (93 F) we decided to keep news of Dad\u2019s passing contained just to family and close personal friends of my immediate family (dad, mom, sister myself) I believed this to be best to help manage my mother\u2019s stress levels and to help her grieve.  \nDue to my mom\u2019s grief and being the oldest I\u2019ve sort of taken on the role of spokesperson for my family. (Planning the service, dealing with introductory legal work, calling my dad\u2019s friends) So last week I sent a text into the extended family group chat requesting that no one post anything about my dad\u2019s passing on social media and that anyone that we wanted to find out would be informed directly by us. I also made it extremely clear my mom sister and grandmother were on the same page regarding social media.  \nThe service came and went and was obviously extremely hard on my entire family \u00a0especially my mom. Obviously today being Father\u2019s Day was another hard day and we planned a quiet day. However that was ruined by my cousin. She (19 F) decided that in addition to posting a tribute to her dad she posted a message about the loss my dad (her uncle) as well.  \nMe my sister and my mom received a massive influx of calls and texts. Which greatly upset my mom. I was more annoyed that people I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to since high school were now acting like my best friend however the vast majority of my anger was reserved for my cousin.  \nI sent her a text in the family group chat furious at her for ignoring our plainly stated wishes regarding social media and for upsetting my very fragile mom. Her mom (my aunt) retaliated that we can\u2019t control how her daughter grieves the loss of her uncle. She sent one in telling me that (1.I didn\u2019t make it clear the social media ban extended beyond the service 2. Did I expect her to never just talk about her uncle again)  \nI said that it was obvious she was hunting for attention and sympathy. And that if she is not welcome around my mom due to the upset she caused. Pretty much my entire extended family agree that her posting was insensitive. But my aunt and cousin maintain that I overreacted and can\u2019t expect other people to grieve in the same way I did", "created_utc": 1687123951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cvtmu/aita_for_being_furious_that_my_cousin_posted/", "score": 1106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your aunt and cousin have some audacity to accuse you of controlling their grief while simultaneously interfering with yours. \n\nThe exact situation you were trying to avoid happened because of your cousin\u2019s lack of consideration for your family\u2019s (entirely reasonable) wishes. At 19, she should know better and your aunt even more so! \n\nI\u2019m really sorry for your loss and I hope you\u2019re given the space to grieve how you need to.", "NTA.

I can appreciate that you're grieving also, but the impact of your post means that my mother has been receiving a lot of calls and outreach that she doesn't want. It has increased her suffering. I did ask the family not to post or discuss Dad's death on social media, and perhaps I didn't make this part clear \u2014 my request stands for as long as Mom's grief is still raw. So, please take down your post, I'd be grateful and I know that Mom will be relieved. Thank you for understanding.*\n\nYou really have to spell it out plainly for most people. And the first hint of anger or bitchiness will put most people on the defensive, making it impossible to have empathy for your position.", "Honestly torn.   You can't dictate how others grieve a loved family member.   But I also don't think you're wrong either.", "ESH, but not for the reason you think. People were going to find out about the passing. It was ludicrous to  believe that your fathers death was going to be hidden. To be honest, it\u2019s amazing that it went that long before people found out.\n\nI understand trying to protect your mother, but if she was that bad the answer was dragging to therapy, not hiding the fact that somebody died. It was never, ever going to work.\n\nI understand that you were looking out for your mom, and you, but JFC it was never going to be successful.", "NTA. My nephew passed and it was very difficult and I wanted to post about it because I basically went MIA for a bit but held off until my brother and sister in law posted online. I followed their lead. Was it my loss? Yes. Did they have a greater loss? Absolutely.", "INFO: why do you want the death of the father essentially kept a secret? I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but I\u2019m struggling to understand why you don\u2019t want people to know.", "INFO\n\nSo is your cousin's mother your dad's sister then?", "INFO: How long was the gag order supposed to last until?", "NTA. Don't post about dead family members when others closer to them (i.e., kids and spouses) are around to see what you say. At the bare minimum, ask before you say anything, especially the first year. I'm not sure why grieving has to be so public; tell close friends, don't blast it to everyone you know on Facebook. Even better! You can set privacy on posts. Set it to a small group only.", "Info: how close was your cousin to your dad?", "Wanting a quiet service was a reasonable ask. You are not TA for that. Wanting ***no contact from anyone*** on Father's Day was also a reasonable ask, but your post gives the impression that ***that*** was a secret plan you didn't communicate to anyone.\n\n>hunting for attention and sympathy\n\nHunting for sympathy is a normal thing people do when sad. Social media is designed to make every social interaction look like a plea for attention.\n\nYTA, because your plan to keep your father's death secret had no clear-cut endpoint when it was OK to talk about him. I seriously doubt your mother's mental state would benefit from random people who didn't know her well talking to her as if he were still alive, although at least they would be more spaced out.", "YTA You can't reasonably expect people to keep a death of a family member a secret beyond the date of the funeral. Just because he was your father doesn't mean you get to police how other people grieve for him.\n\nI would also add that only allowing people directly contacted by you to be aware of his passing is an awful way to treat people who may have been his friends. I have many friends my wife doesn't know and wouldn't think to contact if I died, and vice versa, by keeping it secret you're potentially denying a lot of other people the opportunity to grieve and pay their respect.\n\nGenerally of you send a message of condolence to someone who has lost a loved one you don't expect a reply as you understand that the person is grieving and will have received many many messages from other people, so you and your mother are under no pressure to reply to any within any timeframe. \n\nBe grateful there were so many people who loved your Dad.", "YTA. A reasonable person would assume your request for no social media posts extends to the funeral and not beyond. \n\nEverything your aunt said was right. Sorry your mom was upset but turning around and unleashing all that pain and frustration on your cousin is a total dick move.", "NTA. Yeah, maybe she's grieving, but that doesn't mean that she had to do that. You and your family requested one thing and she didn't respect your wishes.", "NTA. I\u2019d introduce your cousin and aunt to the concept of [ring theory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/promoting-hope-preventing-suicide/201705/ring-theory-helps-us-bring-comfort-in?amp). \n\nIn a crisis, the innermost ring is filled with the people closest to the crisis. That would be your mom, sister, and you.\n\nThe outer rings are comprised of people less close to the crisis in descending order. \n\nThe center ring takes priority. The second ring takes precedence over the third ring and so on, but should offer comfort and support inwards.\n\nTwo weeks is an incredibly short period of time. It is not hard at all to be respectful of a grieving widow\u2019s wishes two weeks out. \n\nIt\u2019s disingenuous of your aunt and cousin to pretend like you were never going to lift the moratorium on social media posts. You\u2019re all just catching your breath for god\u2019s sake. Their inability to see this and their willingness to argue with a grieving widow and her children shows a remarkable lack of empathy on their parts.\n\nI\u2019m so very sorry for you.", "I'm very sorry for your loss.\nAnd I'm sorry to say, but YTA.\n\nI agree with many people thinking that after the funeral, most people would think it's ok to post. I do think she should have added that the family requests privacy at this time though. His death dosnt belong to one person, and unfortunately you can't control what other people do.\n\nIt dosent seem like she did this maliciously. It seems like she's just a kid thinking that's the best way to honor her Uncle.\n\nBut you're asking our opinions on this. Maybe your doing it because you think you'll get validation here, but you're not getting it from me.", "YTA. I get a temporary gag order (I.e. don\u2019t post until it\u2019s been a week or so or until after the funeral), but you don\u2019t get to stop her from grieving forever. Also, it sounds like your instructions were unclear (and were definitely unreasonable). I understand that he\u2019s your dad and your mom\u2019s husband. But he was other things to other people to (like an uncle to your cousin) and those other people get to process their grief and talk about their loss with others.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure your cousin is grieving but right now the wishes of your mum and siblings are important.\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and I hope your cousin understands what a tough time this is right now.", "ESH. There\u2019s a fair chance your cousin mentioned your dad\u2019s passing for a bit of social media attention. But at the same time, it\u2019s entirely unreasonable to try and control all knowledge of your dad\u2019s death, like you\u2019re the board of Samsung, especially so long after the funeral.\n\nBy delaying it, you increased the likelihood of this happening unexpectedly and some on something like father\u2019s day. And if your mum is in such a fragile state and it was so important to have a quiet father\u2019s day, you and she could have turned off/unplugged your phones.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. That must be difficult. You\u2019re grieving, so I think you should be given a pass here. But you should have specified how long you wanted things kept under wraps. \n\nAfter the service had passed, I would\nhave assumed the social media ban was lifted too.\n\nthere\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting some sympathy when your uncle dies. it\u2019s normal to want for support from your friends when somebody passes on. I don\u2019t think your cousin didn\u2019t anything wrong.", "NTA,\n\nYou requested nothing be posted on social media. And she didn\u2019t respect your wishes. This is pretty clear and cut. You have every right to be upset and your aunt and cousin are in the wrong here.  Sucks you have to to go through that, especially because of your mom. \n\nI\u2019d add as well, might be best to not continue to argue though. I\u2019m assuming your mom is unaware what cousin did? She doesn\u2019t need added stress of family arguing amongst themselves", "YTA. It wasn't clear that the request extended beyond the service, so she didn't know. But, what really makes you TA is saying she's hunting for attention. You aren't the only family member grieving. You seem insensitive and controlling. She lost a family member, too.", "NTA\nMy half aunt just pulled this sh!t with me and I absolutely lost it. DM'd her demanding she takes the post down. Called her out for being an attention seeking a*hole. These people will continue to act this way until their bad behavior gets a spotlight on it. Shine away, my friend.\nAlso, I am *so sorry* about your loss and totally understand there aren't words. Keep your dad's memory alive everyday, in everyway you can.", "NTA. You\u2019ve said your piece now take it to the next level and go low or no contact with them. This way they can grieve the way they want and you don\u2019t have to know about it. Unfortunately, you are going to be the one fielding all the calls and extra attention but try to stay strong and help your family through this. Your Aunt and cousin are emotional vampires who will bleed you dry if you allow it!", "NTA... cousin and aunt needs to learn about  boundaries...", "NTA.. the last sentence explains it all. They don\u2019t care about your family and what you are going through they are hoping to have sympathy places towards them and are in fact seeking attention. Unfortunately in my late teens early twenties I did the same. She\u2019ll learn, but she\u2019ll learn a little too late. Im sorry for you loss.", "I hate saying YTA but you are here. You do not know her motives in posting. And yeah how long are people supposed to not talk about it?  It would feel weird I would think to NOT mention a recent father loss in the family. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely valid to wait for everyone who needs to be told to be told without the shock of seeing it on social media. However you are passed that and already had the service even. \n\nAlso a massive influx of calls and texts sounds like many people did not yet know who likely deserved to as well. \n\nYour way of grieving is not the only valid way.\n\nEditing to add - a social media post that included the family is requesting privacy st this time could be helpful to deal with well meaning individuals reaching out. That along with a point person in a sense who can help detour people away from your mom. This was kind of what we did when my dad passed. I don\u2019t love talking about it, I\u2019m not a person who\u2019s comfortable with a lot of it so other people stepped in and kind of helped shelter the immediate family. But all his friends and coworkers, extended family, acquaintances etc they deserved to know as well.", "YTA, not necessarily for the social media ban but for not having a way to inform folks.  In this day and age that can mean social media, but the communication blackout extending so long doesn't strike me as reasonable.", "YTA. Keeping death a secret will only hinder the grief process, not allowing anyone acceptance. It doesn't seem as though you even considered how your fathers passing has affected your cousin. Pain is not exclusive, and everyone deals with it differently. Just because you or your mother hurt does not give you the authority to control how other people manage their pain.", "ESH\nyou can\u2019t gatekeep someone\u2019s death.\nbut she went against your wishes.\nSo sorry for your loss and everything that has come with it.", "It's a difficult time for everybody. Was your cousin wrong in posting on IG? Maybe. But at this point, you can't tell people how to grieve your father or memorialize him.\n\nAre all your cousins' 2500 IG followers strangers or people who knew your father and are reaching out to extend their sympathies? Your father's death will not remain secret for long, anybody not related to the family could have posted it. People's natural inclination upon hearing about a death is to contact the family to express condolences without thinking about whether the family is in any shape to hear them.\n\nYour mother is dealing with the sudden loss of her partner so her emotions ard going to be all over the place. You and your sibling are trying to help your mother while dealing with your own grief. This would have occurred without the IG post.\n\nWhat you need to do now is take a step back and mourn your loss. Don't answer the phone or use social media. Have a relative monitor the phone/social media so you can reach out to people at a later date. I know it's hard now but some people reaching out to you through social media might have stories about your dad that you have never heard and might appreciate knowing. \n\nGrieving a sudden loss is not easy and takes time. The 'firsts' (holidays, birthdays, etc) are always hard. Just when you think that you have a handle on it, you see/hear something that brings you back to square one.

The social media post is just making it about them and getting people to feel badly for them. It\u2019s obnoxious. \nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I\u2019ve been there. Sending love and healing wishes.", "NTA", "I\u2019m not going to give you an asshole judgment, because I think the situation has too much nuance to break it down into such black and white terms. \n\nIt seems like from some of your comments that what you\u2019re most upset about is that yesterday your mom was doing pretty good emotionally, but today she\u2019s experiencing a lot of pain and having a much more emotional day. It\u2019s easy to blame the social media post and the reach outs she\u2019s had today, but honestly that\u2019s just how grief works. \n\nShe will have days where she feels human, and days where every piece of her being still feels shattered. It\u2019s hard to see your mom like this, and obviously very painful knowing that you lost your dad as well. \n\nDon\u2019t let this pain fester into anger at your cousin, she didn\u2019t make a post to hurt your mother or by extension you. It might feel like a grab for attention, but that\u2019s an unfair assessment. People react differently to loss and use social media for all kinds of different reasons. I don\u2019t think your ask to keep things offline was unreasonable, but I can see how she misunderstood the timeline you were implying. I imagine she felt she was giving him a nice memorial in a way that she felt that she could and in a timeline that she felt was appropriate. Reaching out to ask if the social media ban was still in effect after the service probably didn\u2019t occur to her, because by now his loss has been communicated to so many. Keeping it a secret won\u2019t make the loss hurt any less. \n\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the loss of your father. NAH.", "I think that you are grieving with your mother and close family and that is a terrible thing to have to deal with. It is unfortunate that your cousin posted on social media when you expressed your wishes to her. But I want you to understand that she is also grieving and she\u2019s very young so there\u2019s a part of her that is selfish and what she did. But you need to give it some time so that everyone can get past this terrible event in their lives, and hopefully repair the relationship for the future Because families should always stay together if it\u2019s healthy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s very sad that your father passed! but he wasn\u2019t just a father, a son and a husband. he WAS an uncle too, he was a friend, he was a brother and maybe more. \n\nhere is my story: for me my aunts sudden death was one of the most extreme things that happened in my life so far. I was 28, quite old already, but she was the first person in my life that died that I loved that dearly. I had never experienced such a feeling before. I know you learn young about death but for me it was then that I actually got to learn how it feels, what it means, and that it is real. Sound silly but this was entirely new and shocking for me. The first week was intense. In retrospective, I think I might even had some sort of psychosis. I lost my connection to reality (I don\u2019t want to go into d tail about this week for me though) It was surreal. The following weeks it got better but I I was still not just in grieve but in a state of shock. I cried a lot, about her and also this Realisation of death. It took me a while hole year to get back to normal I\u2019d say.I did also think about my cousin a lot, her daughter. We are only one year apart, i could feel her paun kilometets away it seemed\u2026 we did text and I had the feeling (still do) that it did actually help her that we exchanged our thoughts and feelings, she knows I loved her mom so much, and I couldn\u2019t even yet imagine how much more pain I\u2019d feel if it was my own mother\u2026. My family held together strong, we are all very close and I think it brought us together even closer (especially after corona making it difficult for us to be together before that)\n\nthat being said, I didn\u2019t post on social media, but that\u2019s not something i do ever about personal topics. I don\u2019t think you though that you are being fair in pointing at your cousin calling her attention seeking only on the Internet. it seems you are dismissing entirely what the death of your father did to her, too. Death as a whole. Maybe she wasn\u2019t even thinking rational. maybe she just needed support too?\n\nI understand you are in pain.and two weeks no posting all that that is totally reasonable of you. But I don\u2019t think you have any right to express your furiosity about someone posting about it online. that\u2019s not fair and honestly quite inconsiderate of other people. it\u2019s a world of the www - for some people that means a lot. \n\n This was long but after reading so many comments on this and that, I wanted to bring into the conversation a hopeful new perspective for you on how other people who are not child, parent or souse of a dead person can experience the death of a loved person. I know you feel pain, but she does too maybe. Are you more in pain than she? Maybe, but the pain she is feeling is the most she feels right now too, it\u2019s not fair to compare them and put them on a scale. everybody\u2019s pain is still a huge thing for each person. you want her to be understanding and considerate if your feelings. But you aren\u2019t anything than criticism of her, accusing her of not actually feeling anything and only oooking for attention. That is not fair. I think in seats you should hold together more and except that different people experience things differently and act differently. Group hug\n\nNAH", "NAH.

Every year on what would've been her birthday, my cousins post about her on social media. Only they all want to be the first to post and get the attention, so they post earlier and earlier each year. This year they posted 4 days before her birthday. It's laughable, and thankfully I no longer have a relationship with most of them now that my grandmother has passed. Some people just suck.", "That is literally what OP is saying. \n\n\u201cAnybody we want to know will be notified by us\u201d\n\nAnd they clarified that they indeed expected her never to talk about her uncle again. That\u2019s whacked.", "I don\u2019t care how close she was to the uncle, her grief doesn\u2019t trump respect for his widow and children.", "Family friend is a licensed psychologist and has been staying at the house. Has been an absolute godsend for my mom.", "I\u2019m *not* saying it was required to be announced, but it\u2019s also weird to say no one is allowed to talk about it. How can 200 people be reasonable, but not more than that? OP isn\u2019t answering.", "She has every right to dictate how things are handled with \"HER\" father. Father, Husband and Son trump Uncle and the kids, wife and mother all agreed to jeep it off social media. The cousin had no right to post on social media after being told not to. The fact that only the Aunt and Cousin disagree proves everyone else in the family understood and had no issue with the request. Definitely NTA.", "JUST DON\"T TALK ABOUT MY DAD. FOR AN ADULT IT\"S NOT A COMPLEX REQUEST. Some people on here are treating it like I forbade her from breathing.", "He absolutely is misplacing his grief and anger and if you call him out on it he simply replies that he knows these people best. In that case I don't really understand why he brought this to a forum anyway. Nonetheless I am sorry for your loss, and having experienced exactly what you described, I think you are spot on with all of your assessments.", "Or maybe OP can focus on not appeasing the people (his aunt and cousin) who couldn't respect their very simple and explicitly wishes to hold off on announcing his father's death on social media...?", "I mean I put it in the title of the post- \"AITA for being furious\" so yeah I'm pretty angry. Upsetting my grieving mom for social media likes tends to do that to me", "Actually when I spoke to every person, I indeed requested they keep the news off Social Media  and that given the confined space of the church we were having the service in to run it by me if they were going to bring someone other than their partners.  AND when I spoke at the service I requested privacy and empathy for my mom. So yeah I'd say I made our families wishes clear.", "Some friend\u2019s of family and people who are acquainted call to send condolences, which is nice but when you\u2019re in such a state of grief you don\u2019t have the mental function to deal with it. Most often times when those types of people call it\u2019s just to be nosey and find out what happened.", "I doubt OP is talking about literal random people. It could be mom's cousin's best friend who was close to mom but never met dad. It could be dad's former coworker he hadn't seen for over a decade.", "If my cousin is treating his wife (My mom) like this. She didn't care about my dad at all and If he was still here He'd be the one reading her the riot act. The lack of consideration is mind boggling. My mom is in medical danger due to the stress of the loss, You'd think when I make a call on what's best for her after consulting with a psychologist people would listen.", "Idk man\u2026 OP said in another comment that the post made people literally show up to her house uninvited. That\u2019s kinda messed up. Id be pissed too.", "Wow, that's reaching. If anything the fact that they are not from her dad's side of the family makes this even more egregious. Her dad was their in-law; they had no right to decide when a public announcement was made. Also, may I remind you it's only been TWO WEEKS? I could see OP being wrong if it had been two years, but two weeks? Really? And you're trying to claim OP secretly hates her mother's family over this?", "It was a very reasonable request not to post anything on social media for my mom's sake.", "They said they called everyone they knew, so it sounds like all of the Dad\u2019s actual friends (or people he considered important) know. Those are the only people who matter, really. \nWe haven\u2019t posted about my grandpa dying like that and it\u2019s literally been 5 years. He didn\u2019t like social media, my grandma also echoed the sentiment, so we don\u2019t. it\u2019s the bare minimum to respect what the dead person and the immediate family in question wants, and takes 0 effort. Anyone who wasn\u2019t in the know who cares post funeral is probably looking for gossip.\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019m sure they put something in the obituaries. Besides, If you haven\u2019t heard anything from an acquaintance in awhile wouldn\u2019t you ask around and find out that way? Idk about you but I wouldn\u2019t go to an acquaintance\u2019s funeral anyway.", "But in this case she was specifically asked not to.", "People are also allowed to poop their pants at weddings. What\u2019s your point?", "He's not saying she can't grieve. He just didn't want anything posted on social media about his father's passing for the exact reason that happened. His mother is suffering, her mental health means more than his cousin's grief.", "That depends on if aunt/cousin actually feel regret for their misbehavior and acknowledge that they overstepped.", "If she told friends (which of course she did) then I doubt OP would have any issues with that.\nOp didn\u2019t say she could never talk about her uncle again, just that posting on social media is attention seeking, which is true.", "Spouse and children trump niece", "So, actually fuck off. Social media A.) isn\u2019t really a place to grieve and B.) you can\u2019t just post about someone who passed when those closest get affected by it. \n\nShe KNEW it was a private ordeal and wanted the \u201coh I\u2019m so sorry\u201d \u201cno it\u2019s okay \ud83d\ude22 pity me pity me\u201d bullshit. It wasn\u2019t an opportunity to grieve. It was reaching for attention.", "By asking? It\u2019s clear the immediate family is taking this loss hard, and is trying to keep to themselves.

OP is making it sound like no one was allowed to say anything ever and that is entirely unreasonable.", "this is not difficult.  posting on social media is way to get points.  to show off.  it also brings your business to people you didnt want knowing this information.  op wanted to keep this quiet for the sake of his mother.  posting it on social media is not keeping it quiet.  \n\nthe immediate family gets to control who knows.  the cousin is wrong. and selfish.", "Not necessarily.  Her dad isn't just HER family member.  He has a very wide family.  I do think the cousin was disrespectful and should have waited.

Beyond what you just mentioned?  It sounds like she is in a really bad place and could use more support which shouldn't fully fall on you", "Like I said NAH. \n\nUnless the cousin was posting to intentionally stir up drama for her aunt, which is severely doubtful, she\u2019s not an asshole. He\u2019s not really an asshole for being upset because of how it is all affecting his mother.\n\nBut he shouldn\u2019t villainize his cousin either as if she was doing it for any other reason but to give tribute to a man in her life she lived on Father\u2019s Day. \n\nIt\u2019s complex for sure, but idk, NAH was my verdict I can\u2019t fault anyone that much here.", "OP literally is saying their dad\u2019s family has more class. I don\u2019t know how that can be more clear.", "They\u2019ve already said the funeral was attended by 200+ people.", "Yeah. I doubt they know all of the dad's friends or close acquaintances. I know I don't know all of my parents' friends. They don't know all of mine either.", "Wait\u2026 It was a neighbor that stopped by to offer condolences? That\u2019s hardly a random person and it\u2019s odd they weren\u2019t amongst those you\u2019d tell.

I appreciate your position. Truly I do. My cousin posted on fb about my dad passing before I knew *(I was away at college during finals in my senior year).  I think it's reasonable to ask that folks hold off until the family knows. Even reasonable until after the service if you didn't want a ton of attendees. 2 weeks later and she's not allowed to say anything is unreasonable in my experience.", "And OP makes it sound like no one was ever allowed to say anything and it\u2019s been two weeks. That\u2019s an AH move. Also saying their dad\u2019s side is \u201cclassy\u201d compared to mom\u2019s side IMO speaks to a deeper issue. OP does not like mom\u2019s side, not just this specific cousin. And a funeral of over 200 people? Something isn\u2019t adding up.", "Just because they're a closer relation doesn't give OP the right to prevent anyone from grieving however they want.", "What? No, that\u2019s not how that works.", "I agree I don\u2019t think anyone can figure out what is going on yet because the grief is still so much in the forefront, but I really hope this family can come back together and love each other", "It\u2019s not a competition.", "Oh I didn\u2019t realize that you were a psychic who knows exactly why this complete stranger you\u2019ve never met did what she did and also that you are the social media police \n\nPardon me, officer.

But she chose to do it publicly when the immediate family specifically requested for the info regarding the death to be kept back. It\u2019s clear that OPs mom isn\u2019t handling this loss well and spreading the info has only added on unnecessary stress, the exact reason they didn\u2019t want things posted. \n\nThe nieces grieving process shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of the wife\u2019s grieving process.", "Posting on FB is not grieving.

I am from a small town, when my dad died, my mom started avoiding the local grocery store because she couldn't go in there without well meaning acquaintances stopping to give their condolences.\n\nA friend of the family was in Florida for the winter when my dad died and found out about the accident when they came back in the spring and sent my mom a sympathy card and she burst into tears when she saw it. \n\nThat flood of well meaning people is exhausting.", "I'm so sorry for your loss and that your cousin is an asshole on top of it. \n\nCan you report the post to FB and ask them to take it down?", "Most often you don\u2019t but that doesn\u2019t stop your phone from blowing up. You still have to keep your phone by your side for important calls related to the death of the loved one, such as banks, lawyers, insurances ect. When someone dies you don\u2019t just take time to grieve. From the time they die for weeks and months you have to handle their death. You\u2019re in despair, grieving, and depressed waiting on important phones calls, making important phone calls and you have everyone and their mother calling you and your not in a mental place to deal with it.", "Yeah , TIL it is not appropriate to extent sympathy to acquaintances .. it is a  privilege reserved for the inner circle   /s\n\nOP, Seriously, stop being so up your own ass.   I know you hurt, but the majority of people who sends well wishes after a death, does it with the best of intentions.  Unless there was something weird or awkward about someone\u2019s death, it is bizarre to assume that people are just sympathizing to be nosy.  Turning the death into some sort of secret probably did more to attract attention and pique curiosity, once news broke, than a simple death notice would have done.", "We have a psychologist staying at the house with us.", "Yeah, the whole situation just seems weird because OP said elsewhere that the cousin is related via OP\u2019s mom, not dad..", "Because they clearly have more class!! The fathers side who was most likely closer to the father did not cause the mess and stress out the grieving widow on her first  Father\u2019s Day with out the father of her children", "Not like a neighbor who lives across the street or next door. The lady lives behind us and then two houses over. The only interaction I remember having with her is waving when I used to walk the dog.", "No it is not unreasonable to allow the immediate family of the deceased to decide how to inform people of their loved one's passing on their own time rather than posting in two weeks on social media against their express wishes.\n\nHow is this even up for debate?", "It kind of does when the cousin couldn't wait two weeks after the passing. Two. Weeks.", "One of my favorite things after my brother passed was reading stories from his friends/coworkers/old army buddies/etc. And seeing pictures I had never seen or had  forgotten about.  Social media doesn't have to be all bad.", "NTA. I disagree. They are a fairly young family, Mom is only 51. I despise seeing people posting on social media and fishing for likes, sympathies and attention from strangers. It's so ICK. Social Media has only been around for about 20 years, before that people didn't need to grieve a loss by advertising it to thousands of people they've never met, for I'm sorry's.. What if Dad died under suspicious circumstances that they don't want made public? They made a request, but the cousin needed the sympathy likes more.", "She went against the wishes of the immediate family, that\u2019s extremely disrespectful. Grief isn\u2019t a competition and everyone will go though it in their own way, but let\u2019s have some perspective here. OPs mom is clearly not taking the loss well and needed some extra time before having to grieve publicly.", "Obituaries are put in papers because the family CHOOSES to put them in the paper. Families didn't always choose to do this.", "Exactly. Just because they aren't looking at their phone doesn't mean the texts quit coming. I feel awful for OP and his fam.", "I am glad to hear that. I know you didn't ask for advice on this so please ignore it if it's not helpful, but it's sometimes helpful to step away from these threads if they are making you more angry.

Don't show your grief.\"", "20 years ago, there were email prayer chains and church news bulletins. People have always found ways to share grief and information. She wasn't making details of his death, known only that he had died. Would you be as angry about it if she had stood up in a church with 500+ congregants and made a prayer request?", "The cousin is 19 and should have known better. Literally announcing/posting a tribute to your uncle when your family is still grieving him and explicitly asked you not to post is such an Asshole move and yet of course commenters here still defend such nonsense.", "Your Dad didn't even get an obituary in the paper?", "Yeah you're right, how dare they send such a message, it was only their husband and father. Did they not even stop to think about his niece and all her followers. People these days are so entitled.", "Idk maybe I\u2019m bitter but I feel like \u201cgrief isn\u2019t a competition\u201d doesn\u2019t fit when it comes to a son requesting something very simple from his cousin about his OWN FATHERS passing. Her grief is valid but she overstepped the boundaries of son, daughter, and mother who are just trying to survive right now.", "OP literally clarified that he expected her never to talk about her uncles passing.\n\nOP has themselves confused with the divine ruler of the universe. \n\nSorry, not sorry.", "I did ask, he didn't answer. Was putting it out there. By OPs own admission hundreds of people knew. It's very clear that he just wants to have control over everyone, not out of malice, but is very much not in control. Starting a war over this is a great distraction, but it's not going to help in the end. And another comment he claims the mother is medicated and someone asked is it safely and being controlled by a doctor and he hasn't answer that question either", "But it is extremely rare to not put an obituary in the paper. Source: several family members who are morticians. The most often reason obituaries are not put in the paper and services are hidden or placed after the services are when drugs are involved. Anecdotal I suppose, But I'm also not in the mood to look up the statistics on that. Also how do you have a service with over 200 people and expect things to remain a secret?", "Which she could manage since it was Two. Weeks. Seriously, I've had family members passed. I left it up to them to announce their loved one(s) passing on their time rather than take it upon myself to do so. It's not a difficult concept when his death was still so fresh/recent.", "Ok, yes. But a lot of those were pretty much anonymous back then. Irregardless OP's Mom was young, Dad was probably also. Maybe only they know the circumstances of his death. Mom and kids asked for privacy, and only told the people who they wanted to know. It was probably for a reason, and their wishes should have been respected.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "He wouldn't have wanted that. You know how I know he wouldn't have wanted that. He told me.", "I forgot that only the immediate family is entitled to grieve.", "To never talk about it is extreme, I agree. However I feel like it should be slightly common sense to not make a post on Father\u2019s Day, especially when the loss is still so raw and fresh in their minds. They themselves didn\u2019t make any posts or anything related to it so, and Im just thinking about if I was in cousins shoes, I wouldn\u2019t have made one. Maybe it\u2019s just hard to me to say if someone is a true AH here. I think it\u2019s just overwhelming grief with nowhere to go. I hope everyone involved gets support somehow.", "You're the one who seems a little in need of control, asking random commenters because your question was ignored by OP", "You say their loved ones but we have no idea how close this person was to the deceased. Some families have incredibly close relationships that go beyond the immediate household.  \n\nI'm not arguing posting it on social media was a good idea. It was tacky", "The only stated reason is that Mom was struggling, which is understandable but doesn't change the fact that they can't expect to forever control who says what. You're also naive if you think Church email chains or prayer requests were anonymous back then. If that was the case, I wouldn't have received emails from my sister's ex-FIL after a near death accident because of an email chain my aunt shared information on.", "hey, don't get all snippy when you come on the internet telling us your dramatic tale and we have questions. Jesus, do any of you realize you're posting this shit on a forum when you're doing it?", "And I forgot that internet points for the extended family are more important than the wishes of the immediate family.", "Why are you taking everything so personally? I'm sorry that my comments are getting you out of sorts or bringing up trauma", "She has 2500 followers", "If she was close enough to the Uncle, she absolutely could have, and I argue *should* have, waited the two weeks to not post on Father's Day. So she loved the Uncle so much to anger his widow and children on purpose?", "Right.. but Dad could have passed due to reasons they don't anyone to know. I'm not naive at all, I remember those prayer chains, and I am a religious person. I say you're the naive one if you think forwarding a prayer by email, to GOD, will be heard by Him faster and louder than closing your eyes and actually saying one to Him. The internet is not an express lane to heaven."]}
