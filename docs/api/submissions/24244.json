I suspect your MIL has the same mentality, or else just doesn't believe in chronic illness. Or both. Both is good. \n\nYour husband needs to step up. Ask him, why does he want you to be around people who dismiss your illness so easily? Is his desire to 'keep the peace' more important than your health? What happens when you have a serious fainting fit when she's the only one around, and she just leaves you there? Will he still insist that you spend time with them?

But modern people really do not have a context for a small sickness leaving a person permanently incapacitated. That just seems alien and mind boggling. So while frustrating, I get why she finds the entire situation impossible to accept or comprehend, and has instead defaulted to thinking it's suspicious. Tossing gasoline on the fire are the convenient timing (you dropped out of the work force the second her son was locked in), her protectiveness of her son and family, and that she would be to blame, since she sent you on the cruise.\n\nI don't think this will get better unless you get better, so focus on deescalating and minimizing damage and exposure. Avoid explosive confrontations demanding apologies. Get to know her slowly and personally, separate from your issues.", "NTA.

It seems you have three problems here.\n\nYour husband does not consider that your person and your health deserve seriousness and respect because a comfortable relationship with his mother is more important to him, meaning that it does not bring him any complications directly. Selfish husband.\n\nWhen people are self-centered, disrespectful and always wants to be right, it is a progressive behavior since as they see that nobody sets limits they feel under the power of absolute reason and they will not stop because in their mind it is like that. The only way it is what they believe and say. This also applies to inventing scenarios where they leave you wrong to be more right about you.\n\nDo not evade and face with accurate communication. The ideal is that your husband sets limits, but he does not do it because he is not interested since he is not the one directly affected in public, you must do it. learn to defend yourself intelligently and without fighting. This is something that can become a direct trigger for symptoms, due to the emotional lack of control that it can cause you. Consult it with your psychiatrist.\n\nNTA OP. Please, put yourself first, since your husband prefers to keep his mother happy with him than your health, you must put yourself as a priority and consult with your doctor what is best to avoid detonating your body. Don't force yourself to be with someone who destroys you just because of social conventions. And this also applies to your marriage. And remember OP, if a worse symptom is triggered, and does more damage to your body because of a third party, be it your husband, his mother, or whoever, the one that is going to be left with the permanent damage, the permanent pain and the permanent condition for the rest of your life is going to be you.

Your husband is trying to rug sweep his mothers behavior because it's easier for him right now. He needs to go and sit her down and have the talk. He loves her, gets that she thinks she's protecting him, but he knows his wife is not faking, loves and believes in her. That she (mother), is putting in an untenable position and causing him exteme duress by continuing her behavior so she IS NOT protecting him but actually harming him and to freaking knock it off. Do this when there hasn't been a drama so she can't say \"what did I do? or \"she's overreacting\" or \"it was just a joke\". Just take a pass on an event and let him explain why you won't be coming. OR, my other strong suggestion, learn to ignore the ignorant. You know you're ill, you don't need her acknowledgement.

Then their spouses and children suffer for the fact that they weren't actually ready to prioritize the person they promised to prioritize.", "right, this is an untannable situation. either son gets mom to back off or you won't visit or you WILL confront her.\n\nyour son is letting you down by letting his mother continue to abuse you and that is what it is on her part- abuse.", "Why even have contact with someone like that??? Why do people put themselves in these situations when they can be completely avoided by not seeing people like this??? It\u2019s mind boggling.", "NTA, but your husband is for telling you this garbage and for not stopping it immediately by saying, \u201cone more negative word about my wife and this will be the last time you see me.\u201d  You married a giant A.  It isn\u2019t his family that\u2019s the problem.", "NTA. And your husband defending you once and not the other times is crap. He should make quite clear to his mother that if she keeps badmouthing you, he won't be seeing her. Anything less than that isn't acceptable. You are married, and the vows you made to each aren't being respected.", "NTA, darling. I've had dysautonmia for years and still have relatives question my symptoms to this day and/or purposefully exclude me in the hopes they'll \"catch me lying.\" I would absolutely refuse to even be in the same room as MIL until your husband makes it EXCRUCIATINGLY clear that your health is not up for discussion, period. These types of people are not around when you are hurting and struggling and terrified that something is seriously wrong with your body. You have investigating, testing, diagnosing, and healing to do!!! MIL is medically gaslighting you with no prior knowledge or context. Don't waste your energy on people who want to pretend they're doctors, even if they're \"family.\" I'm certain your vows were \"in sickness and in health\" at that altar, and your husband should start acting like it. I hope that your symptoms improve soon and you start to feel better!!!", "MIL is psycho... Are there tests the doctors can run to see if she put black mold or something on your pillow? She sounds super creepy. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\n>When we got up to leave, she rolled her eyes and laughed.\n\nYour MIL's behaviour is horrendous, and this really highlights it. She *laughs* at you passing out? A decent person would have actually felt guilt, since it was her getting you to join the cruise that got you sick in the first place. (I don't mean she is actually responsible, but that it would be natural for someone to feel some guilt and feel like \"This wouldn't have happened if I didn't insist she goes with us.\")\n\nBut your husband is low-key a real AH here, too. He's essentially letting you be abused and mistreated by his mother, while you are dealing with a chronic illness, under the guise of \"keeping the peace.\" \n\nYou know what's another term for what he's doing? Enabling.", ">still tries to get me to go see them sometimes. \n\nScrew that noise. Nope.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Do not be around this woman. It just gives her ammunition to be more of an A H. Tell hubs he's welcome to go visit, you won't be attending. It's that simple.", "Nta. Im so sorry you feel so unwell. Its very hard when you have an \"invisible\" condition & even worse when there are no answers or diagnosis. Some ppl (esp older generations) tend to think young means perfectly capable & able bodied. Personally, i would avoid her. You don't need toxic ppl. Your husband needs to either cut her off or stand up. Enough is enough. And he needs to know that remaining silent is no different than agreeing with her ( in her eyes). So as long as he allows her to do it, she will.", "What is it you are being diagnosed with", "Uhh.. MIL sounds jealous and has no boundaries. Like.. maybe she thinks these are attention seeking behaviors on your part and it takes the attention off of her somehow? Also, the comment about your intimate life.. says a lot. That's creepy and weird. No boundaries at all. Gross.", "NTA, your MIL is for her ableism/general awfulness, and your husband is for not defending you every time she says something. People like your MIL don\u2019t get it unless told repeatedly and with consequences (aka not seeing their son)  for the behavior continuing. Also an aside, but do you have POTS? I have it following a virus in my early teens, and it hospitalized me before. It also nearly destroyed my education and in turn my life. POTS, while often with varying severity, can be a truly devastating condition. I hope you can find a treatment plan that manages it well enough for you to enjoy life again.", "seems like OP has a husband and a MIL problem...", "Your husband need to stop disagreeing with them privately and deal with the issue.", "My paternal grandmother tried disrespecting my Mom and after a few her 'slipping", "Tell him to stop being the middle man unless he plans to mediate a conversation between you two", "[removed]", "[removed]", "That was my thought too. My long haul covid also caused passing out. \n\nSounds like MIL might be one of those fools who doesn\u2019t think covid is real, or if it is, it\u2019s just \u201cthe flu\u201d.\n\nOP is NTA but MiL really is and husband is too.", "She really does. \ud83d\ude13", "I'd be careful that your husband isn't now buying into his MIL's thinking. He needs to continue to defend you, either verbally or by reducing contact or both.", "He needs to stop ignoring it! He needs to tell her she\u2019s being cruel and judgmental and she has no idea what she\u2019s talking about. She\u2019s taking a tiny fragment of information (mainly that you stopped working after you got married) and making up a whole narrative around it. \n\nIf she can making up lies and gossiping about you, he needs to stop visiting her and definitely stop trying to get you to do so.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA but your MIL AND your husband are.", "My paternal grandmother tried disrespecting my Mom and after a few her 'slipping' a few off hand comments Dad cornered her and said if she ever disrespected my mom again he'd leave and never come back. I can't even imagine the fireworks if she scoffed at a legitimate health issue that my Mom had and kept saying she thought she was faking. Crimeny, he'd go nuclear.  EVERY time she hints or indicates she does not believe you are sick your husband needs to make it clear that it is not tolerated (that's what my Dad did for a time before the 'one more and done' discussion). For crying out loud you contracted this on her stupid cruise to begin with.", ">and now she\u2019s just passive aggressive.\n\nLaughing at you when you pass out is pretty openly aggressive.", "The fact that he still encouraged you to spend time with them is not indicative of him defending you. I'm sorry, but he does not fully have your back entirely", "I'd like to ad we did go no contact with my grandma for a bit. She made a comment about my mom after that final discussion and Dad reminded her of what he said and we packed up and left. After a few weeks of her complaining to the family she finally gave in and apologized to Mom and Dad. She never was particularly kind to my Mom but she behaved after that which is more than she did for the other wives. (My dad is one of four brothers.)", " You married a giant A. It isn\u2019t his family that\u2019s the problem.", "This is so effing funny lmao", "Ah a person of culture I see. Yes definitely expect a ukulele from this kind of person."]}
