My doctors are currently in the process of diagnosing me with a serious chronic illness that came from the viral disease I contracted on the cruise.

Having gone through it, my advice is to remove anyone unsupportive. \n\nNTA for avoiding MIL.

In your position I would go absolutely NC with her.  Your husband is free to go see them but you can bet your ass I certainly wouldn't be.", "You don't have a MIL problem, you have a husband problem.

Is there any way that the MIL feels guilty that she invited you to the cruise where you got sick, and invalidating your illness is her flawed way of assuaging her conscience?", "NTA  \n\nShe's being rude to *you*. You don't \"have to do more\". \n\nWhen people are deliberately rude to me and insult me or lie about me, I don't ever spend time with them. That's the consequences of their bad behavior. \n\nHe's wrong to ask you, who aren't doing anything hostile or rude, to change or put in more effort. His mother is the problem and that is who he should be talking to, not you. \n\nYou could ask your husband which would he prefer, you not going anywhere she will be to avoid her nastiness, or you calling her out each and every time for her snide comments and eye rolls since he won't. He can tell his mom that you no longer want to be around her because she's nothing but rude to you.", "I think your husband needs to step up again, unfortunately.  Or you have to do it yourself.\n\nNTA. Your MIL is an ass.", "NTA - she does sound like she is being rude but this is definitely one of those cases where I think the other person would tell a completely different story.", "I think you guys really have 2 options. Either just go NC and focus on your health, your individual selves and your life together. The other option is for your husband to rock the boat. It would probablybbengood for him, as well as you. MIL needs to be called on her shit. There's a great post from a whole back about why rocking the boat is ok and good. I'll post it when I find the link if someone doesn't beat me to it", "your husbands job to reign his mother in is neglected to the level of it being a serious felony. NTA", "NTA. Your husband is a fucking jackass.", "If you are not peaceful he is not keeping the peace. No reaction is an agreement. Tell hubby being passive doesn\u2019t work. If he isn\u2019t protecting you he is failing as a husband. NTA", "NTA. But your husband needs to sort this shit out. No more ignoring the issue. She needs to drop her attitude and shit talking. I wouldn't go anywhere near her if I were you.", "NTA.  She's toxic and jealous of any attention you receive. I'm so sorry you're going thru an illness and her horrible behaviour.", "NTA.

Invite me to go on a *cruise*?? GTFO!", "The solution is that your husband lets her know that neither of you will continue visits before she changes her attitude and respects you and what you are going through.

Extra points if she pulls out a ukulele", "NTA\n\nIf you passed out and hit your head, she'd leave you there, saying you were faking. The fact your husband acknowledges that his mother is being judgemental but still insisting you be around her is the a feat of cognitive dissonance. \n\n> and that I speak poorly about him behind his back, which I would NEVER dream of doing!\n\nYou say your husband disregarded her comments, but he's clearly failed to see those comments for what they are: _an attempt to end your relationship._ \n\nI'm biased in this situation, I have a cousin with a chronic illness who was regularly dismissed by her caretakers because she was 'too young' to be as debilitated as she was. I suspect your MIL has the same mentality, or else just doesn't believe in chronic illness. Or both. Both is good. \n\nYour husband needs to step up. Ask him, why does he want you to be around people who dismiss your illness so easily? Is his desire to 'keep the peace' more important than your health? What happens when you have a serious fainting fit when she's the only one around, and she just leaves you there? Will he still insist that you spend time with them? Why is he putting _her feelings_ ahead of _your health?_", "NTA but you have a husband issue. He says he addressed it with his mother the first time but has not addressed anything since. He needs to step up and address the issue every time it comes up. Ignoring it is implied agreement. He needs to make it clear to her that her behavior is not acceptable.", "Your husband needs to defend you, not once but every time she\u2019s a witch.

He needs to stand up to his mother.\n\nThis also seems a bit more like an advice post than an AITA post, because I can\u2019t see what you\u2019ve done to be considered an asshole here.", "Your husband is TA", "Your husband is the problem. Him not defending you maks me think he doesn't believe you either.", "That your husband told you what she said means he agrees with her in some small part. He's just using her mouth to tell you.\n\nShe might eventually come around once you have an actual diagnosis and improved on a treatment plan. But modern people really do not have a context for a small sickness leaving a person permanently incapacitated. That just seems alien and mind boggling. So while frustrating, I get why she finds the entire situation impossible to accept or comprehend, and has instead defaulted to thinking it's suspicious. Tossing gasoline on the fire are the convenient timing (you dropped out of the work force the second her son was locked in), her protectiveness of her son and family, and that she would be to blame, since she sent you on the cruise.\n\nI don't think this will get better unless you get better, so focus on deescalating and minimizing damage and exposure. Avoid explosive confrontations demanding apologies. Get to know her slowly and personally, separate from your issues.", "NTA. All she's doing is to downplay the whole situation because she and her idiocy are the cause. Who coudl ever think about booking a cruise one week before the wedding???\n\nAlso, no comment over husband, keeping the peace should not cost your own peace", "\n - When we got up to leave, she rolled her eyes and laughed. My husband is trying to keep the peace -\n\n\nSo your MIL is a bratty teenager who acts like she's a highschool mean girl and your husband allows her to publicly disrespect you because it is not directed at him.\n\n\nWow OP. It seems you have three problems here.\n\nYour husband does not consider that your person and your health deserve seriousness and respect because a comfortable relationship with his mother is more important to him, meaning that it does not bring him any complications directly. Selfish husband.\n\nWhen people are self-centered, disrespectful and always wants to be right, it is a progressive behavior since as they see that nobody sets limits they feel under the power of absolute reason and they will not stop because in their mind it is like that. The only way it is what they believe and say. This also applies to inventing scenarios where they leave you wrong to be more right about you.\n\nDo not evade and face with accurate communication. The ideal is that your husband sets limits, but he does not do it because he is not interested since he is not the one directly affected in public, you must do it. learn to defend yourself intelligently and without fighting. This is something that can become a direct trigger for symptoms, due to the emotional lack of control that it can cause you. Consult it with your psychiatrist.\n\nNTA OP. And please, put yourself first, since your husband prefers to keep his mother happy with him than your health, you must put yourself as a priority and consult with your doctor what is best to avoid detonating your body. Don't force yourself to be with someone who destroys you just because of social conventions. And this also applies to your marriage.", "This! My MIL tried something similar with me and my husband immediately called her out on it and told her to stop spouting bullshit. \n\nOp deserves better.", "My first thought too. My own MIL got my newborn extremely sick. She sort of expressed guilt one time and then just...refused to believe that the baby was actually ill, despite a long hospitalization. Years later, she'll still scoff and roll her eyes if anyone mentions those touch and go weeks.", "\u201cI feel like I can\u2019t confront her, since she thinks her conversation with my husband was in confidence\u201d \nThis is  nonsense, he doesn\u2019t owe this so called confidentiality from his wife whatsoever. He should be defending you loudly to her and everyone and NEVER require you to be around her again until and unless she accepts your illness and issues public apologies. He should be outraged and vocal about it!", "hi. (OP\u2019s MIL\u2019s version)", "Exactly. She doesn't get to complain to him in confidence when the subject of the complaint is the person he chose to marry!"]}
