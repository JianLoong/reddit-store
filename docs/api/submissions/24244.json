I suspect your MIL has the same mentality, or else just doesn't believe in chronic illness. Or both. Both is good. \n\nYour husband needs to step up. Ask him, why does he want you to be around people who dismiss your illness so easily? Is his desire to 'keep the peace' more important than your health? What happens when you have a serious fainting fit when she's the only one around, and she just leaves you there? Will he still insist that you spend time with them?

But modern people really do not have a context for a small sickness leaving a person permanently incapacitated. That just seems alien and mind boggling. So while frustrating, I get why she finds the entire situation impossible to accept or comprehend, and has instead defaulted to thinking it's suspicious. Tossing gasoline on the fire are the convenient timing (you dropped out of the work force the second her son was locked in), her protectiveness of her son and family, and that she would be to blame, since she sent you on the cruise.\n\nI don't think this will get better unless you get better, so focus on deescalating and minimizing damage and exposure. Avoid explosive confrontations demanding apologies. Get to know her slowly and personally, separate from your issues.", "NTA.

It seems you have three problems here.\n\nYour husband does not consider that your person and your health deserve seriousness and respect because a comfortable relationship with his mother is more important to him, meaning that it does not bring him any complications directly. Selfish husband.\n\nWhen people are self-centered, disrespectful and always wants to be right, it is a progressive behavior since as they see that nobody sets limits they feel under the power of absolute reason and they will not stop because in their mind it is like that. The only way it is what they believe and say. This also applies to inventing scenarios where they leave you wrong to be more right about you.\n\nDo not evade and face with accurate communication. The ideal is that your husband sets limits, but he does not do it because he is not interested since he is not the one directly affected in public, you must do it. learn to defend yourself intelligently and without fighting. This is something that can become a direct trigger for symptoms, due to the emotional lack of control that it can cause you. Consult it with your psychiatrist.\n\nNTA OP. Please, put yourself first, since your husband prefers to keep his mother happy with him than your health, you must put yourself as a priority and consult with your doctor what is best to avoid detonating your body. Don't force yourself to be with someone who destroys you just because of social conventions. And this also applies to your marriage. And remember OP, if a worse symptom is triggered, and does more damage to your body because of a third party, be it your husband, his mother, or whoever, the one that is going to be left with the permanent damage, the permanent pain and the permanent condition for the rest of your life is going to be you.

Your husband is trying to rug sweep his mothers behavior because it's easier for him right now. He needs to go and sit her down and have the talk. He loves her, gets that she thinks she's protecting him, but he knows his wife is not faking, loves and believes in her. That she (mother), is putting in an untenable position and causing him exteme duress by continuing her behavior so she IS NOT protecting him but actually harming him and to freaking knock it off. Do this when there hasn't been a drama so she can't say \"what did I do? or \"she's overreacting\" or \"it was just a joke\". Just take a pass on an event and let him explain why you won't be coming. OR, my other strong suggestion, learn to ignore the ignorant. You know you're ill, you don't need her acknowledgement.

Corlanor doesn't affect either and may decrease the sensitivity that causes the fainting as well as bully the heart into a safer range.\n\nAgain, not trying to salesman, but it's the only one of what it can do and it can be hard to find recommendations for this while there are studies that show it can help in general.\n\nHere's a basic stupid explanation for a basic chronic condition. It might be your situation. Stupid explanations can differ because they try to simplify a very complex situation, but work at conveying the seriousness of what you have.\n\nThere is an issue with my bodily functions that has permanently disrupted its ability to properly regulate itself. It is permanently unable to keep me alive without outside help. \n\nAKA: Your wiring is shot. \n\nHere's the POTS one that may apply to you.\n\nA viral disease permanently damaged my Autonomic System. It manifests as a cardiac condition but will never respond to standard cardiac treatment because it's my body makeup, not my heart, that is causing the issue. The cardiac issue is because my body is completely unable to monitor my heart rate or blood pressure. This is permanent. (As far as research shows for now.) I cannot live without medical treatment.\n\nYou need to be harsh and use language like utterly or never Ieave no room for a maybe or Google PHDing. It needs to be simplified in a way that shows someone is bullying you if they're saying things like MIL is.", "Thank you", "It's both.  And yes, I did.  \ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude2d", "Don't do something you aren't comfortable with. Holidays may mean you have to see them but you can lit direct interaction with your MIL. Try to maintain a relationship with your SIL, to make sure she is getting support and to have a relationship with some of his family without subjecting yourself to additional stress or contempt.", "You weren\u2019t there. Of course he told you he defended you but when you\u2019re being insulted in person he can\u2019t say anything? That doesn\u2019t add up.", "Because an engagement and a wedding are Events\u2122 she can brag about to her friends. You're sick all the time and its a bummer and nothing that would give her social cach\u00e9. Sounds like my ex-MIL.

I have to get up ten minutes early so I can get out of bed at a speed that doesn't make me pass tf out; it's annoying as hell.\n\nIf that winds up being the diagnosis, my two main recommendations for investing are a shower chair and that powdered drink stuff that will super hydrate you if you add it to water. Cooling cloths are also a great add-on if you overheat a lot.

I've had people accuse me of using it as an excuse to be lazy. No, you don't need to talk to her and you don't need to forgive her for that. She should be apologizing to you.", "NTA I think your husband needs to have a talk with her. He needs to stand up for his wife and stop being the AH", "NTA.  Your husband should not be \"keeping the peace\". He should be backing you 100%. You come first. Keeping the peace means he believes his mom. It means he cares more about her feelings than yours or your health.", "MOVE AWAY and GO PERMANENTLY NO CONTACT with that CRUEL WITCH", "NTA\n\nYour husband needs to step up and stand up to his mother.  \n\nBeing the mom of a newly married man is difficult.  Tip toeing around your new DIL is difficult.  She is not tip toeing, she is stomping on you.  \n\nI'm so sorry.  Being chronicly ill really sucks.", "NTA but your husband needs to stop this and stop it now. It's his duty as your husband to protect you from her crap. Full stop. So ask him to step up and be a good husband.", "I feel your pain on this OP.\n\nI went through something similar recently. I\u2019ve always had issues with my lungs growing up (my mother was very abusive and smoked during pregnancy and around me as a child and encouraged her friends to do the same) so if I ever get a cold it usually always turns into a chest infection.\n\nA while back I had a really nasty one that lasted over 11 weeks (this while I was being actively treated) and the cough was so severe it ended up breaking a rib.\n\nThe pain was so much I couldn\u2019t move for 6 weeks (mostly because the cough didn\u2019t stop after my rib broke so it felt like it was breaking every time I coughed). They had to give me really strong painkillers and, because I\u2019m a lightweight, they made me incredibly loopy. Because of this I couldn\u2019t work for those 6 weeks.\n\nMy MIL and my husband\u2019s grandma called him during this time and basically told him I was faking being sick because I didn\u2019t want to work (mind you I have always been nothing but polite and nice with them, even when they were down right nasty to me).\n\nBut that for me was the last straw. We were already LC as it was, but now I went completely NC with them. They are disrespectful people that do not deserve my time. And your MIL doesn\u2019t either.\n\nHealth issues are no joke and if she can\u2019t be supportive in this hard times then you don\u2019t want her in your life with her negative comments.\n\nAnd I also agree with everybody else. Your husband should be defending you more and taking your side in this matter.\n\nHe needs to have a talk with his mother and tell her that if these behaviors don\u2019t stop you won\u2019t be visiting anymore. Simple as.\n\nAlso, NTA.", "It sounds like your MIL is projecting her own insecurities. Your MIL feels insecure-not enough in her own eyes so she is trying to cope by giving you rude remarks. Either way, don\u2019t listen to them. If your MIL\u2019s rude remarks are truly getting to you-which they are- your husband needs to speak up and defend your position, or your husband is the AH. It\u2019s concerning when the situation has obvious dysfunction, but nobody will speak out about it.", "she LAUGHED in response to you passing out and he's trying to \"KEEP THE PEACE\"????? Wow", "I hate to say this, but he clearly didn't defend you strongly enough from the beginning of her vendetta against you because if he did, she would not dare to treat you the way she does, especially to your face.\n\nHe should also never make you see his mother and force you to have a relationship with her.\n\nHe should make it very clear that her behavior is downright nasty and obnoxious, and that she has no right to say what she says.", "You talk about complications after a viral illness, but EDS is something you are born with.", "I\u2019m aware, hEDS has always been apart of my life.

NTA.", "Right?! They think you're faking or exaggerating so you don't have to work but don't consider that not working and therefore having no income means you have to give up so much more stuff in life too. It's not at all like choosing not to work because you're independently wealthy and have the luxury of living life purely for enjoyment. They see you \"not having to work\" instead of understanding that it's \"not able to work\" and there is no choice in the matter when you just don't have the energy and physical ability to do it.\n\nYou're NTA, and I hope your doctors can get your diagnosis sorted out and hopefully there's treatment that can help you. Your MIL is an AH, no doubt about it, but I doubt your husband intends to be as unhelpful as he is re: sticking up for you and asking you to spend time with the in-laws. Your illness is still pretty new and it's a big adjustment to spouses as well. Part of what is hard with chronic illness is that it can take so long to get answers and to get diagnoses, and while that process is happening it is hard not to doubt yourself.. surely they would have found something if this was a serious thing? (Doctors in popular entertainment have given us unrealistic ideas about what to expect when something big happens to you. It's all handled so smoothly and efficiently and they *never* say, well, I've got no idea.) Having someone else repeat those same doubts out loud is so hurtful and demoralising when you just want something, anything to change so you can be better. I wonder if maybe your husband is interpreting this through \"new MIL/DIL relationship growing pains\" which we are conditioned to expect to be rocky rather than \"very sick person who needs support, help and validation and very much DOES NOT NEED doubt, derision and demeaning\" and may not realise quite how much it hurts and bothers you that she is like that?", "Ringworm is a fungus that doesn\u2019t go systemic that I\u2019ve ever heard of.

Your MIL is *the worst.* That whole entire kind of person who, despite a complete lack of medical training, decides they can fakeclaim someone with no evidence at all needs to be thrown away. \n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this. Good for you for holding boundaries. Also, I'm side-eying your husband for trying to get you to keep visiting her. That's not great either.", "NTA you have a husband problem.", "YTA.

Each time you get COVID, your chances of getting long COVID increase. My first thought when reading your post was long COVID, too.", "I apologize for piling on, then. It's tough to get a full picture of a situation from a single post-- which is all the more reason to avoid offering judgment outside the scope of the question posed. Lesson learned, for me anyway. \n\nI'm glad you have a good partner in this fight. Support is so vital in the void that is chronic illness. Best of luck to you both!"]}
