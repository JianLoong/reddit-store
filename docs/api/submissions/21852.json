They just want control. \n\nBut now, I can't keep it long anymore because it is prone to hair loss if I keep it long.", "Me too, one of my parents decided to take control of my hair and cut it short my entire childhood until my early teens (I was a girl). They said it was to \"strengthen\" it because it was \"weak\". There is absolutely no evidence that cutting hair short in childhood leads to improving its quality later in life. Unsurprisingly, I have very little contact with this parent decades later (the hair was just a small part of their controlling and often abusive behavior). It took me a very long time to develop a somewhat healthy relationship with my hair (I'm still not fully there, but maybe I'll manage before I lose it all to old age and bad genes).", "My oldest wanted a buzz cut when he was 12.
