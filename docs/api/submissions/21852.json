For a bit of a picture, their hair on top was easily long enough to slick back in to a pony tail or \"man-bun\" if they do chose but generally speaking they just styled it with gel and kept it floppy unless they were home (my oldest likes the man bun look but won't wear it in public due to the acne). \n\nTheir father unfortunately is a very toxic man. He only takes the boys once every 2-3 months for a weekend visit and it's very sporadic. Their grandparents however taken them a little more often than that. They try for once a month. However, due to work schedules, they haven't seen the boys in a couple of months and only just took them this past weekend. As soon as they showed up to grab the boys they started \"joking\" with the boys about their hair. I don't understand this at all because they are Native American and have long hair themselves but where I'm white, my boys have the blonde hair and blue eyes like me (they got dad's tan), versus the dark hair/dark eyes like them. I told them at this point that they love their hair and that was final.\n\nWell, they showed up to drop the kids off last night and I saw my youngest first with a shaved fade that was uneven.

But then my oldest got out of the truck with a sweatshirt covering his entire head and I had a sneaking suspicion and pulled the sweatshirt off. Sure enough, they shaved his head too. He immediately grabbed the sweater and put it back on his head before walking off and not saying absolutely anything to me. I asked why the fuck they shaved his head because I know for an absolute fact that he didn't want it shaved. They said \"they were both itching so we think they have head lice\". I told them that was utter bullshit and asked for the real reason and they eventually caved and said \"their father didn't like the hair and convinced them to cut it\". I lost it. Told them that they were ignorant as fuck to put a kid with insecurities through the bullshit they just did and that because of them, I was going to be battling for the next 3 months to even get my child out of the house.
