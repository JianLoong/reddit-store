Stalking? What other crimes would she be willing to commit?", "Tell your mom that you\u2019re safe as long as her and your father don\u2019t have your address. Trust your gut here and don\u2019t feel bad for doing so. NTA", "NTA.  They have to earn back your trust to give them that information.  In the meantime, a text from you saying that you're okay has to be enough.", "NTA It's a trap! Of course it's a trap.This whole mess started when these people followed you and spied on you. You escaped. That's the thing your mom and dad are most upset with now. Not your safety. That you are out of their reach.", "NTA if you think you will be danger from your parents (especially your father) if you tell. I mean, is your culture such that he might come try and retrieve you and/or hurt you or your boyfriend?\n\nIf you wouldn't be in any danger, and you are just not telling them to be difficult, than YWBTA. So think about which situation you are in, and if you're not in danger, maybe invite them to dinner and repair the relationship.", "NTA. It's your address and your choice. You are an adult, meaning she has neither the right nor the responsibility to \"keep you safe,\" unless you want her to.", "NTA but you will be if you give her that address. That\u2019s your boyfriend\u2019s place, your priority should be only worrying about his safety. Period.", "NTA.  Pick up the phone and tell those people that due to their inappropriate behavior and the way they treated your BF you will not be giving them your address.  \n\nTell them to self reflect, that they owe both of you an apology, and if they can't do that you wish them well and go NC.  \n\nThey sound  racist, classist, or some form of religious stupidity so I wondee why you would even want that", "NTA. I guess your Dad not knowing is to keep you safe. Tell your mother that until they both change their ways you don't want them to know.", "NTA\n\nHow do you feel about using sort of Catch-22 manipulation?\n\nTell her that if anything would happen to you, your boyfriend knows their contacts and will call them.\n\nIf she can't agree with that it means she thinks that your boyfriend may be the one who will hurt you.\n\nAnd it proves that she doesn't accept your relationship, so you can't trust her with your adress.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult yet your mum and dad acted as if you were still a kid. I wouldn\u2019t give them my address if I were in your shoes.", "NTA. You need to be able to feel safe in your own home, and its perfectly reasonable not to disclose your address if you think it puts you and your boyfriend at risk.

You're well within your rights to feel safer without them knowing", "NTA. Once you give that address you can't take it back, so if they decide to be difficult or controlling, you'll have more trouble getting away from them. I say them because she'll absolutely tell your father.", "NTA at all. Sounds like things could escalate and get out of hand quickly if your parents were to ever show up (most likely looking for trouble/confrontation). If I were you, I\u2019d tell your mom that your emergency contacts will let her know if anything were to happen and leave it at that.\n\nJust be sure to have a talk with your sister to let her know how serious you are about this, and that it would constitute a gross violation of your trust if she were to give your mom your address.", "NTA- You are a grown adult with parents who do not approve of your relationship. How much of your mother \u201cwanting to make sure you are safe\u201d is related to her bigotry? What sort of emergency requires she knows your address? Your sister knows your address. Can\u2019t she be in charge of coming to your home for emergencies? There is no situation where your mother NEEDS to know your address.", "NTA!    Sorry that your parents are jerks.    So are mine.     You are doing the right thing.", "NTA.  You are an adult.   Your mom is overbearing.   Make your own choices.

You\u2019re an adult and most likely able to make responsible decisions. I understand your mom being a little stressed, not knowing your boyfriend, but that doesn\u2019t make you the bad guy.", "NTA.

How exactly does she intend to use your address to keep you safe? \n\nThese parents who want information, grace, spare keys, etc, that they\u2019re not entitled to is wild.", ">My boyfriend said that it\u2019s ultimately my choice but he\u2019d prefer that my dad doesn\u2019t find out lol.\n\nI was on your side until this line.

Which is why I like throwing it their face."]}
