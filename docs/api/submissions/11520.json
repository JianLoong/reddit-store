Your mom wants your address so she can know you're safe, but sounds like you're not safe if your dad finds out where you are.  \n\nIt's so sad that it doesn't surprise me a bit that a father might resort to violence against his adult daughter's boyfriend simply because of different race/religion.  If he was abusing you, sure, but different culture?  Sounds like your dad's an AH and your mom's not much better.", "NTA but be prepared for when they find out the address. Not if, when. \n\n>My sister doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do but said that our mom is pretty stressed.\n\n\n\ud83d\ude2c  \n\n\nI admittedly don't know your sister like you do, but if she is constantly being bombarded by your mom to tell her what your address is... It's probably only a matter of time before your sister can't take it and spills the beans. Being surrounded by someone who is hounding you for information and guilting you with their self made stress is a lot. Most people have a breaking point, and your sister will probably reach hers eventually.  \n\n\nA couple of solutions you could try:  \n\n\nTell your mom that the stress she is feeling is entirely on her. Because if she hadn't treated you the way she did, you wouldn't feel so unsafe giving her your address. Tell her to stop harassing people for your address, and warn her that if she continues to do so you will have no choice but to limit contact. Whether that means you going low contact or no contact, doesn't matter. But you have to place that boundary and follow through.  \n\n\nYou might benefit from visiting a support sub for kids raised by narcissists. I'm not saying your parents are narcissists, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck... it might be a narcissist.  \n\n\nGive your sister a fake address she can tell your mom. That way, your mom won't get your real address and your sister gets a free out if your mom drops by for an unannounced visit. She can just claim that's the address she was given, and feign ignorance to the real one. \"I didn't know it was fake! That's the only address she gave me, I don't know the real one!\" Granted, this would only work if your sister has never visited your place, and since she helped you move in I'm guessing that's not the case.  \n\n\nPretend you moved apartments, tell sister your \"new address\", and continue to not share the new fake address with your mom so she doesn't get suspicious. Rinse and repeat last suggestion.  \n\n\nIf you live in an apartment building with a front desk and security, tell them not to let your parents in and give them a picture of your parents.  \n\n\nIf you are in a building that doesn't have that, and your apartment has an old shitty doorknob, ask your landlord to have it replaced with a new one. If you're cool with your landlord, ask if it's possible to have a deadbolt installed.  \n\n\nOverall, setting the boundary and sticking to it is usually the best option. But if it isn't, no one would blame you for using deception. Also, even if you don't do any of this other stuff, talk to your landlord about the doorknob and the deadbolt anyways. You'd be seriously shocked by how many people don't replace those things. It's crazy.", "NTA but I do believe your mother loves & cares about you.\n\nTo relieve her worries you *could* give her the phone numbers of one or two of your close friends (get them to agree first) so if you ever disappear she has somebody to contact.\n\nEDIT - someone says your sister knows where you live. That's good enough and I withdraw my suggestion.", "NTA\n\nYou mom is lying and manipulating you. Both your parents are toxic and you need to shut this address sharing thing down. Clearly if your mom needs to reach you she can. There\u2019s only one reason she wants your address and it\u2019s so she and your dad can further disrupt your life.", "NTA. What happens if you tell your mom, and then your dad finds out that your mom knows? Do either of them know that your sister knows, and are they going to pressure her? \n\nSorry you're going through this, and I feel for your mom, but if there's a question as to the safety and security of your home with respect to your dad, you need to keep it confidential.", "NTA. Your parents sound controlling. They would probably make your life miserable if they knew where you lived. Especially since they were so pissy about the whole *different religion/culture/race* issue.

Shoot their parents?", "No, she\u2019s abusive stop giving bad advice. This could literally get OP in the hospital. You need to stop giving \u201cadvice\u201dto people in abusive situation like \u201cthey love you\u201d,they don\u2019t get over it.", "What an incredibly stupid take.", "Are you dumb?", "Tell your mother that giving out your address is a threat to your safety and that you are not sharing this information because you fear her hatred and anger.", "The end game is some kind of reconciliation at some point - you don't get there without communicating.", "Yes, I understood that. I\u2019m just saying that as she doesn\u2019t know the boyfriend, I understand if she\u2019s a little stressed. I\u2019m not justifying her racism.\n\nI do see that I worded it really badly. I think what I was trying to express was \"I understand your mom being a little stressed as she doesn\u2019t know your boyfriend, but that doesn\u2019t justify anything else she\u2019s done.\" I think I started a sentence one way and ended it while having a different thought? Idk", "Not necessarily white and non-white. Could be something like Muslim/Hindu differences.", "Safety trumps maturity. And seeing their reactions if they turn up at that different address and don't find OP there, would be very useful to relay back to OP to help her decide whether her parents have actually matured enough to respect her and her life choices.", "Her parents are raging racists, yet she's still talking with them. She's weighing out pros and cons of them knowing where she lives.. there's no pro. She still feels bad and questioning her actions online.. you're a dumbass for not seeing through this bullshit.", "Don\u2019t listen to them they want you in contact with your abusive parents. they might even be abusive themselves. They are not safe.", "But what's funny about it. It's not cute... YTA for still talking to your raging racist parents and even questioning sharing your address knowing that could put your bf in harm's way... and lol'ing it... please \ud83d\ude44", "OP is already communicating with her mother, tho. Her mother knows that their behavior was such a huge problem for OP that she moved in with her boyfriend to get away from it. I'm not saying OP should go full NC, just that there's no reason to hand her mother more emotional blackmail fuel. \"How can you say you're afraid of me/us\" while crying and looking martyred, possibly bringing other family members into it so they start pressuring OP to apologize for hurting her mother by saying that, etc... it's just not necessary.", "That may be the end game for OP. Is this the end game for their parents though?\n\nYou can't reconcile with hostile people", "Yeah fair enough.", "She should just set boundaries and just not tell them where she lives, not lie and try to entrap them. That\u2019s some immature bullshit that will cause more drama. It\u2019s also cowardly.", "Where on my post did I say that? I think she should go no contact.", "Just replying \"No\" is essentially going NC. What is she allowed to say in your books?", "Testing your bigoted parents, who have already harmed you psychologically, to see if they're still capable of bringing harm to you if they know where you are, is not cowardly, it's common sense. \n\nYou seem to be trying to put a moral component on this when at the end of the day this is a safety issue. OP's father is still so angry he's refusing to speak to her months later, and her mother is emotionally manipulative. \n\nWith parents like that, I'd be making sure to take any and all precautions to ensure not just my safety, but my boyfriend's, who might be at more risk of backlash from an angry, bigoted father and a mother who's willing to stalk her own child.", "NC means no contact. NC doesn't mean just refusing to give someone all the info they want. OP *is* in contact with her mother, having conversations that are civil--not sure if you missed that part of the post? Continuing that contact without giving her mother her address AND without giving her more ammo to guilt trip or pressure OP into giving in is a reasonable middle ground that isn't even close to NC. I don't know how much clearer to make it or how else to explain that to you, so I'm not sure if you're deliberately missing the point or what.", "Except she's not alllowed to explain why she won't give her address nor give any information that may potentially be used to blackmail or guilt her which can essentially mean anything except answering \"how's the weather?\"", "... deliberately misunderstanding, then. Got it.", "Give me an example of something she is allowed to say then understanding what her mom would be conversing with her about?", "No lol"]}
