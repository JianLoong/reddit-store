Your mom wants your address so she can know you're safe, but sounds like you're not safe if your dad finds out where you are.  \n\nIt's so sad that it doesn't surprise me a bit that a father might resort to violence against his adult daughter's boyfriend simply because of different race/religion.  If he was abusing you, sure, but different culture?  Sounds like your dad's an AH and your mom's not much better.", "NTA but be prepared for when they find out the address. Not if, when. \n\n>My sister doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do but said that our mom is pretty stressed.\n\n\n\ud83d\ude2c  \n\n\nI admittedly don't know your sister like you do, but if she is constantly being bombarded by your mom to tell her what your address is... It's probably only a matter of time before your sister can't take it and spills the beans. Being surrounded by someone who is hounding you for information and guilting you with their self made stress is a lot. Most people have a breaking point, and your sister will probably reach hers eventually.  \n\n\nA couple of solutions you could try:  \n\n\nTell your mom that the stress she is feeling is entirely on her. Because if she hadn't treated you the way she did, you wouldn't feel so unsafe giving her your address. Tell her to stop harassing people for your address, and warn her that if she continues to do so you will have no choice but to limit contact. Whether that means you going low contact or no contact, doesn't matter. But you have to place that boundary and follow through.  \n\n\nYou might benefit from visiting a support sub for kids raised by narcissists. I'm not saying your parents are narcissists, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck... it might be a narcissist.  \n\n\nGive your sister a fake address she can tell your mom. That way, your mom won't get your real address and your sister gets a free out if your mom drops by for an unannounced visit. She can just claim that's the address she was given, and feign ignorance to the real one. \"I didn't know it was fake! That's the only address she gave me, I don't know the real one!\" Granted, this would only work if your sister has never visited your place, and since she helped you move in I'm guessing that's not the case.  \n\n\nPretend you moved apartments, tell sister your \"new address\", and continue to not share the new fake address with your mom so she doesn't get suspicious. Rinse and repeat last suggestion.  \n\n\nIf you live in an apartment building with a front desk and security, tell them not to let your parents in and give them a picture of your parents.  \n\n\nIf you are in a building that doesn't have that, and your apartment has an old shitty doorknob, ask your landlord to have it replaced with a new one. If you're cool with your landlord, ask if it's possible to have a deadbolt installed.  \n\n\nOverall, setting the boundary and sticking to it is usually the best option. But if it isn't, no one would blame you for using deception. Also, even if you don't do any of this other stuff, talk to your landlord about the doorknob and the deadbolt anyways. You'd be seriously shocked by how many people don't replace those things. It's crazy.", "NTA but I do believe your mother loves & cares about you.\n\nTo relieve her worries you *could* give her the phone numbers of one or two of your close friends (get them to agree first) so if you ever disappear she has somebody to contact.\n\nEDIT - someone says your sister knows where you live. That's good enough and I withdraw my suggestion.", "NTA\n\nYou mom is lying and manipulating you. Both your parents are toxic and you need to shut this address sharing thing down. Clearly if your mom needs to reach you she can. There\u2019s only one reason she wants your address and it\u2019s so she and your dad can further disrupt your life.", "NTA. What happens if you tell your mom, and then your dad finds out that your mom knows? Do either of them know that your sister knows, and are they going to pressure her? \n\nSorry you're going through this, and I feel for your mom, but if there's a question as to the safety and security of your home with respect to your dad, you need to keep it confidential.", "NTA. Your parents sound controlling. They would probably make your life miserable if they knew where you lived. Especially since they were so pissy about the whole *different religion/culture/race* issue.
