You have your own child now, your wife needs to prioritize her new family, too.  Having your MIL visit for 3 weeks at a time is VERY generous, you don't need to take her on your vacations, too. Perhaps your wife and her mother should just vacation together. You can stay home and have a real break.", "NTA you have a wife and child and they are your priority now", "NTA you don\u2019t have a MIL problem, you have a wife problem. *She* needs to be the one listening to you and setting the boundaries/expectations with her own mother. Hopefully she supports you more otherwise I guess you\u2019re seeing where you sit on her priorities list.", "So there are two issues here, and I think it\u2019s really important you separate them.\n\n1. Her work schedule seems to be almost the entirety of the time a 72 year old is awake. So when MIL goes to your house she\u2019s really your responsibility.\n\n2. She\u2019s dragging the woman to your family vacations.\n\nI\u2019m gonna say NTA, but how does MIL feel about this? At her age does she want to be spending weeks away from home? Does she have any interest in a destination wedding?", "NTA. I empathize with your wife's concern about the quality of her mom's life. They can always go on cool trips without you.", "NTA\n\nWhy don't you look into getting someone to go visit MIL a couple of times a week? A companion who will take her out and get her to do an activity? That is what we are doing with my MIL (she lives 3 hours away by car, and would want us to be out there twice a month - with little kids!!). \n\nThis way we don't feel guilty that she won't go out unless it's with us. Though, in hindsight, my MIL could go out, she just liked having something to make us feel guilty/force us to see her.\n\n59 days is insane. I would be divorced from my husband if he made me hangout with his mother for 2 months of the year. Your wife is at the point where she needs help - it is impacting your home life. It's time.", "NTA - You have a family now and sometimes you just want to vacation with just your immediate family and that is perfectly okay.\n\nYour MIL doesn't have to go on them all when she's already pretty much taking a vacation by spending 3 weeks with you. Granted it's not at a resort or at the beach, but it is a 3 week break from her regular life.\n\nYou already take care of the MIL while your wife works so it's only fair that you get to take a vacation   without her so you know you don't have to take care of her there too.\n\nMaybe your wife can take vacations with her mother without you and then vacation with just you and your baby.", "NTA, your feelings are valid and it makes sense you are anticipating the trip being a bad idea based on experience. Sounds like this is a tough topic to communicate about within your marriage but not talking about it also comes at a big cost", "NTA\n\nThe two of you have a baby to care for.  You don't want to add caregiving for MIL on top of that.  Of your wife wants to see MIL, she needs to arrange those visits when she (wife) is off work and available to care for her mother.  And if she takes MIL on any travel, your wife needs to be prepared to do all the work to care for her mother.  And that doesn't sound like a fun vacation to me.", "NAH.. Wife needs to make other arrangements for MIL for the destination wedding trip.  But that isn't going to resolve the ongoing resentment that is building up inside you over MIL. You call MIL high-maintenance, a term usually reserved for a person over-indulging in self-care, yet admit MIL needs the care. Also you state how much time MIL is around, but also state how little of that time is actually w your wife who works long hours. So I think you understand that your wife doesn't actually get a lot of time w her mother. I think you could be more understanding given MIL's needs and how little time your wife gets to spend w her. On the other hand it's understandable that you don't enjoy caring for and spending that much time with MIL. But when you married your wife, you became partners and it doesn't sound like she's trying to take advantage of you. Sometimes we gotta just suck it up and do the crappy stuff for the people we love.  She just needs you to step up and be there for her mother when she can't be and to tolerate MIIL's presence so that your wife can spend time with her. I'd discuss with your wife getting a caretaker/companion for her mother and to allow some of her down-time to be spent with just you and the baby,  but in return, you allow a short vacation a year that includes MIL.", "NTA if your wife is worried her mother is home all day alone, she needs to talk to her mom and make some decisions regarding that situation not use it to guilt you into taking her mother on vacation. It also sounds like you care for her mother when she visits, your wife gets to chat after work, but the responsibility falls to you. This is something you need to discuss", "NAH - She is all her mom has and her mom seems like a nice person. You are allowed to feel they way you do, but signing up for aging parents is part of marriage. It\u2019s hard for your wife to see her mom going downhill. Try to be more supportive.

Keep your child home. \n\nFor one she ll spend time with her mother as she says she whishes and for another she ll get a taste of what it means to be there caring for her - not exactly what you do at home when your Mil visits as you also work and care for your child but I'm sure it will be far from a piece of cake.\n\nI would propose to wife to take maybe half or a quarter? of vacation time to spend alone with her mom and the other half alone with you+ baby ( and another time the remaining 1/4 together for a short vacation all of you?).\n\nHaving her there on every vacation is quite tiresome.", "Also, OP's wife needs to understand that it's not about quantity of time spent together.

I have a similar situation.  My husband, until recently, got very little vacation each year.  Every year he'd insist on using all of it to visit his mother and his father.  (They're divorced so it would have been WWIII if he'd visited just one or the other.)  Visits would be sitting around all day and watching TV or playing cards.  I stopped going, especially since his family would snipe at me because we didn't visit often enough.  (I wanted to scream, \"We're using all our vacation on you as is!  Back the F off!\")  On our 10th anniversary, we finally had enough vacation time saved up to go to the UK.  His mom \"just happened to be\" visiting the UK during our time there so we spent half our anniversary with her doing the stuff she wanted to do (and that we had ZERO interest in).

Seeing her mother for almost 2 whole months a year isn\u2019t a small amount of time, it\u2019s a lot and that would be great if she was spending all the time with MIL, but she\u2019s not and it sounds like it\u2019s put you into a MIL deficit. That you\u2019ve had too much of her and now the idea of seeing her brings dread. \n\nAs far as the situation itself: my suggestion would be to either have your mil come for a week and attend the wedding and then leave. After that you & your partner can spend the rest of the time alone. Having your own little happy romanic family holiday with the Bub.

If your wife cannot attend to her mother the majority of the time or hire some sort of care assistant, it is selfish to keep adding her additional tasks on your already full plate. Understandable that she wants her mother around, but you deserve breaks and vacation moments too. So if she can\u2019t take off or hire a care assistant, then her mothers time needs to be cut shorter and she should only do close vacations as she has become more of a burden on you than not.", "nta", "NAH: your wife wanting to spend time with her mother and see her more than 2 months a year doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable, you not wanting that extra stress in your home while being the primary parent to your toddler also isn\u2019t unreasonable. \n\nyou putting your foot down on the MIL not coming to the wedding of a childhood friend is a little weird to me, I\u2019m assuming the bride invited the MIL because she has fond memories of her as well as your wife growing up. If anything, you\u2019re more of the third wheel for that wedding unless you\u2019re also close to the bride. I can see why your wife was upset by it because the MIL was explicitly invited, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s tagging along for a typical family vacation, it\u2019s just a destination wedding. \n\nI feel like there\u2019s probably a good compromise here like an immediate family only vacation annually and when the MIL comes to stay with you clear expectations about what your role is.  showing a houseguest to turn on the tv doesn\u2019t seem like a huge imposition but since you\u2019re also cooking for her 3 times a day then it totally is and your wife should understand cutting those 3 week stints to only the 4 days she can be at home to help you. You never mentioned that you told your partner that you feel imposed on when MIL is in town so you can\u2019t assume she knows how hard it is for you, especially if she comes from a culture where there\u2019s different expectations around caring for aging parents. \n\nYour MIL is clearly a very important person in your partners life and it\u2019s important to her to make time to see her mom while she\u2019s still around.

It didn\u2019t fit in my original post but when my MIL is around there is SO much tension in the environment, because, for example, I don\u2019t let MIL take care of the baby and I don\u2019t even like that she holds her in her arms because she has so many health issues that I\u2019m scared something might happen to the baby if she trips and fall or whatever, my wife agrees that MIL shouldn\u2019t be left alone with the baby but she NEVER talks to her about the reason because she thinks it might make her feel bad, so we have to walk around egg shells for her not to notice something that is pretty obvious.

It is really hard", "Omg I\u2019m so sorry. This sounds awful :(", "I don\u2019t know how, but she manages to do it while victimizing herself", "We\u2019ve talked about this since before we got married, I\u2019ve always known she might live with us at one point, but I never expected I had to be the one taking care of her.", "I do know all of this and I think that you understand how I go about this. I kind of suck it up because I know it\u2019s important for her. But the thing is, my MIL is not always the nicest to me, so it\u2019s kind of hard to be this great caretaker for someone who repeatedly tells you that you\u2019re fat (even after having a baby), or that has told me I look awful in an outfit while pregnant", "I understand that, but kind of hate the \u201cshe won\u2019t be here forever\u201d narrative, my wife\u2019s grandma (her mother\u2019s mom) is still alive at 96, so what, I have to wait 25 years to start living my life?", "I do know that! Last year when we took her on our vacations for 10 days it was actually My idea, and my own wife ended up saying that it\u2019s not something we should do again.. and now? \ud83e\udee0 it is like she forgot", "Could you send me links? Would love to check those out", "I do think she understands that but she can\u2019t just leave work, if it was for her she would spend the whole time at home with us I think! When she\u2019s home, she takes care of her mother and I don\u2019t have to, but when she\u2019s not here I have to do it", "If I spent 60 days a year with my parents I would divorce ME", "This might be a good place to start. It is okay to communicate this and would help alleviate the stress!", "Can I just say that I live 15 minutes away from both sets of my parents and yet you see your MIL more in a year than I see them. I love my parents but there has to be healthy boundaries.", "Omg SHE HAS A DEMON DOG TOOOO!! And we\u2019re talking about buying a house and MIL wants to pitch in and I\u2019m so scared of this exact same thing happening \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0", "With this I mean that I don\u2019t think waiting for them to die soon is the answer, you know?", "https://www.caregiveraction.org/community\n\nhttps://www.agingcare.com/caregiver-forum\n\nhttps://www.care.com/c/caregiver-support-groups/\n\nAlso a few on reddit", "What I was trying to suggest was this. She knows she has limited PTO. Rather than trying to stretch her mom's visit over many weeks (thus putting the onus of hosting/caretaking on someone else), she needs to pick a dedicated set of time aside when she's free for her mom's visit, or she's free to visit her mom. Use that time to primarily interact with her. (Quality, not quantity.)  If that ends up being only 10 days a year or every other year, so be it, but I can bet you it will be a lot more memorable to both of them than what she's doing right now. \n\n\nWhat she's doing right now is dragging the poor woman out of her familiar, comfort zone and into your busy daily lives or into your vacation as \"a side activity\" instead of \"the main event\" (thus, quantity time vs. quality time), and for what? So she can feel less guilty? She needs to consider how you - her wife - and her child feel about all this, as well as her mother. It's not just her own life that she's disrupting here.", "I\u2019ve told her ALL of this, and she just says that\u2019s the way she is \ud83e\udee0", "Boundaries were set. She \u201cjoked\u201d about visiting us and we all laughed, but then she booked a year in advance of flights. During her Fall visit we have a plan to tell her she\u2019s welcomed for 2 weeks at a time and 3 months apart in visits. That\u2019s the plan.", "We love our home and have sunk a lot in upgrades into it. It\u2019s easier to stay. Luckily, I have a husband that feels the same and we have a plan. Thank you!", "She\u2019s refused money from us.", "Thanks!!", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to not want your MIL to come on all of your vacations. Three week visits are unusually long. She should appreciate that you put up with that. That\u2019s a long time of another person in your space. I couldn\u2019t stand it. I would definitely sit down together and explain in detail why you want some alone time. Or like others suggest, they should go on their own trip together.", "NTA.  A trip to Mexico as you described will be a nightmare for you and your wife.  A long flight, then living in a foreign country for a while, and God Forbid she catches Montezuma's revenge!  Then she will end up on a hospital.\n\nWhen I go to Mexico (which I love) I do not drink the water, I do not consume drinks with ice in them (water, right?) and no fresh foods that are prolly washed in water. I only consume well-cooked foods and drinks from sealed canisters - like coca-cola.  I have never gotten sick in Mexico, but by the end of the week I am desperate for a salad, veggies and fruit - and ice!  Can you imagine enforcing those sorts of dietary restrictions on your MIL?  I cannot.\n\nObviously, your wife loves her mother very much.  Could you suggest a 3-day trip away from home to somewhere closer to MIL's home?  This one trip does not have to be the ONLY trip you could take with MIL.", "Tell your wife her mom can stay as long as she can get off work. Your basically taking care of two children and working from home. I\u2019m sorry but your nta to me. I get that she worries about her mom but at some point she has to understand all the extra work that you have to do to accommodate her. Good luck.", "Since discussion isn\u2019t working, you\u2019re going to have to do some things which will be uncomfortable. If your wife wants to manage her mother at the wedding, let her know you won\u2019t attend. When MIL comes to visit, offer X amount of time that you will entertain her. For the remainder of that time, wife needs to take PTO or shorten the visit.\n\nYou\u2019re only going to resent your wife if this continues and it is not going to be easier to set boundaries later. My MIL is 90. Do you want to do this another 18 years? NTA.", "Or OP can go on holiday and wife can look after the baby and mil, while she enjoys the wedding.", "I live a 5 minute walk from my mom and only see her for an hour or 2 a month. I might be a shitty son for that, but it works for us. My sister actually lives less than a block from me and I only see her every couple months.", "Your wife and MIL are delusional. She should get scanned for bone density at least, and have an emergency call button, if she doesn't have one yet. A hip fracture has a 1 year mortality rate of 25% . That is one bad fall away.", "Does your wife understand that you won\u2019t be her caregiver? That is not a conversation you can let slide until the problem arrives. Trust me.", "I'm sorry to hear that she treats you that way. In that case I would insist that wife find someone other than you to care for MIL"]}
