She\u2019s 33 too, an only child, and her mom is 72, widowed and lives alone in another country (but is only 2 hours by a direct fly away) \n\nWe have a 15 months old baby girl and usually have a really good relationship with great communication, except when it comes to my MIL, specially after the baby arrived.\n\nMy wife feels really responsible for her, and I\u2019ve always loved how much she cares for the ones she loves, but I think that she doesn\u2019t know how to divide herself between wanting to spending time with me and the baby, and wanting to spend time with her mom, so she tries to put us all together all the time. \n\nShe told me today that she counted the days that we saw her mother last year and they were \u201cjust 59\u201d. It sounds so little when you say it like that, but is practically two months if you think about it, and out of all those days, my MIL spent the most time with me. \n\nMy wife works outside the house from 9 am to 7 pm, and I work from home. MIL comes in long visits to stay at our house (at least 3 weeks). Before the baby I didn\u2019t mind as much, it was kind of annoying not being able to have my routines but I didn\u2019t mind as much; now with the baby is really hard because I feel like I have to attend to her on top of taking care of my baby.\n\nMIL is really high maintenance because she has issues with her eyesight and can\u2019t do almost anything alone (not even turning on the TV) she can\u2019t cook, and she obviously can\u2019t take care of the baby (I will not let her), so when she comes it is more work for me. I\u2019ve talked to my wife about this and she tries to take a few days off of work when she\u2019s here, but she can\u2019t take 3 weeks every 4 months.\n\nLast year we took her on our summer vacations with us because it was that or going to stay at my MIL house for 3 weeks (since the baby was little and we didn\u2019t wanna move as much).\n\nNow, my wife and I have been invited to Mexico to a wedding of one of my wife\u2019s best friends from her childhood, and her friend told her that she could bring her mom too \ud83e\udee0 my wife asked me what I thought and I said I didn\u2019t think it was ideal (that\u2019s what I said, I thought it is CRAZY to bring my MIL to a summer vacation in another continent, in a beach resort where she will probably want to even share rooms with us \ud83e\udee0) I prefer not going to be honest. \n\nNow my wife is mad because she noticed I didn\u2019t want MIL on that trip, and says that if she doesn\u2019t bring her on vacations with us she would never be out of her house. I think I\u2019m reasonable but I don\u2019t now, maybe ITA?", "created_utc": 1684670152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nr2tk/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_our_vacations_with/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have your own child now, your wife needs to prioritize her new family, too.  Having your MIL visit for 3 weeks at a time is VERY generous, you don't need to take her on your vacations, too. Perhaps your wife and her mother should just vacation together. You can stay home and have a real break.", "NTA you have a wife and child and they are your priority now", "NTA you don\u2019t have a MIL problem, you have a wife problem. *She* needs to be the one listening to you and setting the boundaries/expectations with her own mother. Hopefully she supports you more otherwise I guess you\u2019re seeing where you sit on her priorities list.", "So there are two issues here, and I think it\u2019s really important you separate them.\n\n1. Her work schedule seems to be almost the entirety of the time a 72 year old is awake. So when MIL goes to your house she\u2019s really your responsibility.\n\n2. She\u2019s dragging the woman to your family vacations.\n\nI\u2019m gonna say NTA, but how does MIL feel about this? At her age does she want to be spending weeks away from home? Does she have any interest in a destination wedding?", "NTA. I empathize with your wife's concern about the quality of her mom's life. They can always go on cool trips without you.", "NTA\n\nWhy don't you look into getting someone to go visit MIL a couple of times a week? A companion who will take her out and get her to do an activity? That is what we are doing with my MIL (she lives 3 hours away by car, and would want us to be out there twice a month - with little kids!!). \n\nThis way we don't feel guilty that she won't go out unless it's with us. Though, in hindsight, my MIL could go out, she just liked having something to make us feel guilty/force us to see her.\n\n59 days is insane. I would be divorced from my husband if he made me hangout with his mother for 2 months of the year. Your wife is at the point where she needs help - it is impacting your home life. It's time.", "NTA - You have a family now and sometimes you just want to vacation with just your immediate family and that is perfectly okay.\n\nYour MIL doesn't have to go on them all when she's already pretty much taking a vacation by spending 3 weeks with you. Granted it's not at a resort or at the beach, but it is a 3 week break from her regular life.\n\nYou already take care of the MIL while your wife works so it's only fair that you get to take a vacation   without her so you know you don't have to take care of her there too.\n\nMaybe your wife can take vacations with her mother without you and then vacation with just you and your baby.", "NTA, your feelings are valid and it makes sense you are anticipating the trip being a bad idea based on experience. Sounds like this is a tough topic to communicate about within your marriage but not talking about it also comes at a big cost", "NTA\n\nThe two of you have a baby to care for.  You don't want to add caregiving for MIL on top of that.  Of your wife wants to see MIL, she needs to arrange those visits when she (wife) is off work and available to care for her mother.  And if she takes MIL on any travel, your wife needs to be prepared to do all the work to care for her mother.  And that doesn't sound like a fun vacation to me.", "NAH.. Wife needs to make other arrangements for MIL for the destination wedding trip.  But that isn't going to resolve the ongoing resentment that is building up inside you over MIL. You call MIL high-maintenance, a term usually reserved for a person over-indulging in self-care, yet admit MIL needs the care. Also you state how much time MIL is around, but also state how little of that time is actually w your wife who works long hours. So I think you understand that your wife doesn't actually get a lot of time w her mother. I think you could be more understanding given MIL's needs and how little time your wife gets to spend w her. On the other hand it's understandable that you don't enjoy caring for and spending that much time with MIL. But when you married your wife, you became partners and it doesn't sound like she's trying to take advantage of you. Sometimes we gotta just suck it up and do the crappy stuff for the people we love.  She just needs you to step up and be there for her mother when she can't be and to tolerate MIIL's presence so that your wife can spend time with her. I'd discuss with your wife getting a caretaker/companion for her mother and to allow some of her down-time to be spent with just you and the baby,  but in return, you allow a short vacation a year that includes MIL.", "NTA if your wife is worried her mother is home all day alone, she needs to talk to her mom and make some decisions regarding that situation not use it to guilt you into taking her mother on vacation. It also sounds like you care for her mother when she visits, your wife gets to chat after work, but the responsibility falls to you. This is something you need to discuss", "NAH - She is all her mom has and her mom seems like a nice person. You are allowed to feel they way you do, but signing up for aging parents is part of marriage. It\u2019s hard for your wife to see her mom going downhill. Try to be more supportive. She won\u2019t be here forever.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
