I don\u2019t mess with people that blatantly hypocritical", "Nope!", "NTA\nFriends are the family we choose for ourselves, your nephew may not be blood but it doesn't make him any less family than your sister's child. Your sister has no right to expect anything from you, whatever you give her baby is a gift and should be valued, not compared to what you have given anybody else.", "Your pocket book is not up to your mother to regulate and certainly not up to your sister to have a helping hand in. \n\nNTA, put them both in their place and let them know you know exactly what family and it is certainly not keeping a list of how much monetary value an item is.", "Chosen family is stille family. Your \"blood\" disowned you at a formative time in your life - Jay was there and supported you. \n\nFuck them and their entitled assholery NTA", "Your family is toxic. They\u2019re under the impression that you\u2019re supposed to allow them to mistreat you due to being blood relatives \n\nThey disowned you, but now they want to be able to control your behavior and gossip about you? Eff em\n\nNTA", "Jay is your family of choice. Your family of the heart. Tell your bio family that they do not earn your money, so kindly stop trying to spend it for you.", "NTA. Why is your sister going through your things and looking up the cost when she\u2019s at your flat? That\u2019s sketchy- has your family welcomed you back in because you make good money now and they want  to benefit from that? That\u2019s some audacity for her to think she\u2019s the only person you should spend money on.", "Jay is your family and someone your actually close to\n\n\nYour mother is just a relative who disowned you \nYour sister is greedy and and entitled", "Nta and what, prioritise just like they did when they disowned you??", "Info: Why are you blaming your sister for your distant relationship when it is your parents' fault?  Did she cause it?\nIt's fine to be friends with Jay and think of her. But now that your sister and you are adults, you could be trying to deepen your relationship. \n\nDid you ever think that your sister is hurt that you don't value her when she had no control over the past situation?", "NTA. Family is more than blood. Jay has treated you like family. Your mother has not. She lost any right to give you advice when she kicked you out and disowned you. Your sister is entitled.", "NTA\n\nI have friends, too, who consider my children their niece and nephew while they are not interested in the child of the sister of one of them. \n\nThat's because we treate them with respect and attention unlike the sister.", " \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\"", "NTA - It sounds like Jay and her parents are more your family from you post and comments. I have good family and bad family. I 100% have friends that are more important than family. They are more my family, blood means nothing. Hold close the ones that actually care about you", "Prioritize family?! They disowned you. To me they ain't family anymore. Your mom and sister are entitled and the AH. I'd tell your mom that too the next time she says something.", "NTA. If you mom disowned you, she doesn't get an opinion on ANYTHING you do. Why don't you just block her?", "NTA. What in the actual fuck? Your sister is looney tunes.", "NTA\n\nFamily isn't just about genetics, Jay and her son are your family too. Also - you can spend your money on whoever you want and you've already been generous getting your sister a \u00a3100 gift", "Lol your mother that disowned you is telling you to prioritize blood relationships? The woman that disowned her child feels like she has any moral stand to tell said child what to do? Fuck them, you are NTA, mom/sister/nephew are your relatives, Jay and her child are your family.", "NTA!! The entitlement is outrageous! Your birth family lost the right to be prioritized when they threw you out of it!!!! Jay is your family now. If they don't like it, they know where to find the door. No more gifts for them!", "NTA. They're proving your point.", "NTA your bio family dropped you before, you made a logical family to be your foundation. You are not a walking ATM", "NTA. It is your money that work for. Spend it any way you choose. You do not owe them an explanation", "I should add Jay lives abroad now. I fly to visit her a few times a year and honestly mum has had an issue with that too\n\nI think they feel like Jay is not my bio faM and physically she\u2019s thousands of miles away so I should focus on the people in front of me", "Mum has kinda apologised for the disownment in her way. She now says that it was mainly my dad pushing her. I know that them disagreeing about me is part of why they separated in the end\n\nBut yeah Jay and her parents were there for me when I really felt alone and I think of them as family", "I more or less agree but it's a little unfair to claim the sister should have \"been there\" for OP when the sister was a literal child living under her parents' care. A 12(ish) year old (I am assuming based on the given ages and guessing the disowning was around 18 or 19?) is not able to make that kind of stand against their guardians, if they are even remotely aware of what's really going on (since most people who disown a child for the wrong reasons are lying to their other children to seem more correct).\n\nI'm more curious why OP's mother is even involved here if they were disowned.", ">physically she\u2019s thousands of miles away so I should focus on the people in front of me\n\nLol. No. \"Focus on the people in front of you\" is for customer service not relationships. Maintaining a relationship over distance is hard. You are merely showing that Jay is in your thoughts even though they are miles away. Focus on the people who support you and who love you. That's clearly not your sister or mom.", "It's your money, spend it however way you like, she wasn't even there for you when you were disowned so personally I'd take back the Dock Tot. And the \"people in front of you\" were the ones who disowned you while your friend supported you so I don't think I'd be talking if I abandoned my daughter or my sibling.\n\nThey have no say in how you spend your money.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Your mum is your relative. Jay is family.", "But your bio fam, threw you out without a thought. But now you should give a damn about them? \n\nNTA.", "is this the same mother that disowned you at 18?  \nThe audacity,", "She disowned you, so she is no longer your family by her choice.", "Once you're an adult, your family is who you choose and it sounds as though Jay has been more of a family to you than the biological ones. You are definitely NTA and I would take with a grain of salt what your mom and sis says. Stay strong and continue to choose your family. Mom and sis definitely the AH's.", "They see you as an ATM", "OP, they DISOWNED YOU. End of story and NTA.", ">Mum has kinda apologised for the disownment in her way. She now says that it was mainly my dad pushing her\n\nI don't buy this bs, what kind of parent disowns their own child because the other parent was pushing/convincing them? And a \"kinda apology\" doesn't make up for your pain, OP. They weren't there for you when you needed them, and they didn't even do the bare bare minimum which is provide a good apology and attempt to make up for the decision of abandoning you, instead they act entitled to your money.\n\nNTA, I'd go NC.", "I see it seems you have forgiven her for it, but don't forget what they did because even if she was pushed into it she still made that choice. I'm not telling you to hold it over her head, but don't let her get away with being a hypocrite. Set the boundaries and enforce them. The boundary being don't talk about what family does and who family is because she lost that right a long time ago. Jay and her parents are your real family (too? I'm not sure how you view your bio family)", "Mum can get lost with her not apology for the disownment and try to police a full adult relationship with their family. Entitled toxic sis sounds insufferable and like a terrible sister. \n\nOP when you grow up family are the ones you choose, Jay and her child are your family by choice, Jay and her parents has shown you much more love and respect than your entitled sister and mum.\nNTA but stop listening to that horrible toxic people.", "Aaaaand the crowd goes WILD lol.", "I hear that in Charlotte Dobre's voice.", "I just can't imagine being so blatantly greedy and just so sucky. They are nosey, intrusive and have absolutely no real affection with OP. Tell Mom, whatever amount you're giving to sister, you want the same. That's only fair, and family like. The hand held out in front of you, mom"]}
