The amount of work needed to raise a puppy correctly is about the same.", "YTA.

Sure, yours grows up to be a person instead of furry with a tail, but at this stage, it is *somewhat* comparable from the point of them not sleeping though the night, constantly having to go potty, and such. Not the same, but comparable, especially in the lost sleep department.\n\nInstead of seeing the comparison for what it was: an attempt to commiserate; you went nuclear and insulted and embarrassed her in her place of work. Rightly you\u2019d be fired for being so hostile in the workplace. You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m not your boss.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely TA.", "YTA because she was just trying to relate to you by explaining she too has a pooping eating sleeping machine.

I hate these conversations at work and it is certainly annoying as F- when dog owners think what they have to do is anything like being a parent.

Pet lovers who think their animals are even remotely close to an actual child/parent relationship are ridiculous.", "YTA, any normal person knows babies and puppies are not the same. However, she was clearly implying puppies can be similar to new borns in the SENSE that they eat, poop and sleep and do require a lot of care. \n\nI think you took this way too literally when she seems to not have been implying that babies and puppies are the same.

They can walk. They can eat on their own. They're furry. You don't have to save for college. If anything, she was demeaning the puppy comparing it to your baby.", "NAH\n\nI found fur parent comparisons annoying too. I mean we both potty train, yeah..but I have a character to build. ....\n\nMy standard was to smile and nod with enthusiam.

Your part in this whole baby-making adventure was pretty minimal until the last month or so, so maybe that's not so different from having a new puppy.  \n\nShe was just trying to make conversation.  Get over yourself.", "YTA\n\nWhat a weird response to someone just trying to make conversation. Have people been saying your baby looks like a dog or something?

It's not a slight against your newborn that puppies exist.", "ESH. Drawing comparisons is a weak attempt at actual empathy.

Her going to the store probably took longer than your actual contribution to your wife's pregnancy.  And you were talking about your new child, news flash nobody cares.  She was trying to commiserate not compare.  You were a Jerk to her.", "YTA.  I don't think she was saying her dog is the same as your baby.  She said she knew a bit of your experience with sleepless nights and poop and constant supervision.  Clearly she struck a nerve with you but you overreacted.  Unless she continued to go crazy dog parent lady with you, her comments were pretty innocuous and could have been laughed off.", "YTA for the way that you handled it. Like yes, a puppy is not the same as a baby, but a person, as misguided as she may have been, was trying to relate to you and you simply shut her down, and from the sounds of things pretty rudely (I mean, you told her that you found her empathy insulting).", "She was trying to empathize with your sleep deprivation. She wasn't calling having a dog and a baby the same thing.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nBabies are essentially as engaging as a puppy. Non verbal and totally relying on their caretakers.\n\nEase down, Papa Bear", "NTA", "YTA. \n\nSounds like she was just being conversational by trying to relate to you, not trying to imply that they are the same, so your reaction comes across as aggressive and rude. \n\nEven if she does consider her puppy the same as your baby, you\u2019d still be an ah for rudely minimizing her life. Getting a puppy isn\u2019t the same as having a baby, but they can indeed generate the same types of emotions and feelings for the person experiencing it. \n\nYour reaction was way over the top for the situation, and even a bit mean.", "Nta.", "It sounds like she was trying to be supportive and sympathetic, not say a puppy is the same as a child. \n\n>\tYou just went to the store and bought your dog\n\nAs opposed to you, who did what? Birth the child? (You didn\u2019t). Not to mention, people do adopt children. They literally meet them at the airport. So \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\nYTA.", "YTA assuredly. Your coworker made a connection of similarity between the demands on a new parent dealing with a creature that eats, sleeps, defecates and makes frequent requests for attention, and what a pet owner has when dealing with a new pet which also eats, sleeps, defecates and requires constant attention.\n\nGranted it is not a perfect replication and there are differences, but she wasn't saying \"Hey you and me are exactly the same! All suffering together!\" it honestly comes across like this coworker was trying to initiate a social interaction with you, and you shot her down quite rudely. The fact that she's requested to be taken off this project says a lot about how negatively she's taken this interaction.\n\nYou can't just disregard someone's experience because of how they acquired their bundle of responsibility. Yes she may have picked it up from a shop, but does that mean she has any less love for it than you have for yours? Would you say someone who adopted a child has any less right to love their kid than you do yours, when they also kinda \"picked them up from  a facility\" rather than growing the progeny in their own body? (and before anyone says anything I know a human child is not the same thing as an animal, but that does not mean the love we have for them is any different. Most pet owners refer to their pets as their babies so there is definitely a correlation of love given there)", "Soft YTA.   \n\n\nThis particular woman was just trying to establish a rapport with you in a clunky way. You were a little harsh.\n\nYou should have saved your powder for the \"Pet Parent\" who really, really believes their pet is exactly the same as your kid, and gets openly pissed off if your kid needs surgery and the team bands together to send the kid a toy, but there's no similar fuss made over Noodles getting spayed.", "YTA. She said she knew \"a bit\" what you were going through and was trying to commiserate and build rapport with shared experiences. You overreacted and made it weird by saying she was insulting you. I wouldn't want to work with you either; you sound deeply fragile and I'd be worried about setting you off again. \n\nContext: I'm infertile, my cats are my \"furbabies\", and it's always weird when parents want to take time to inform me that it's \"not the same\" when I know that and am not saying they are.", "YTA. She's trying to engage with you and join the convo you said yall are on a team. A dog much like a child (if cared for properly) is a massive change to a person's routine and life. No puppies and babies aren't the same but they both require a lot of attention and caring for.", "Hmm difficult one. You\u2019re not wrong in what you said but I think you did too much. As a parent of 5, I get that it\u2019s jarring when people try to compare pets but you could have just said yea it\u2019s really not the same and brushed it off. Not make out like she maliciously denigrated your baby. She was trying to be empathetic. With your tone, I\u2019m not surprised sh\nR no longer wants to be on the project. She\u2019s likely really embarrassed.\n\nEdit to add :EAH", "YTA. Did it ever occur to you that possibly she's **not able to have a child**? Perhaps she cannot afford adoption? A pet is the closest she can get to having a child. Yet you, who got off and got pregnant, think you're special? Pfft. Animals can do what you did, and they aren't mean about it.", "YTA\n\nShe was trying to connect with you and you blew up on her and acted like a total ahole. She never said they were the exact same thing, she said she could understand A BIT of what you were going thru.\n\nAnd guess what? in our society people treat pets like their children! You know this, right? You haven't been living under a rock for your whole life? So a small bit of socialization shouldn't be sending you up the wall like this. Get therapy.", "NTA - being a dog owner and consistently trying to claim parenthood is preposterous and you were completely justified in putting your colleague in their place.  I\u2019m astonished by all the pet nutters here voraciously defending this colleague to the point of somehow extrapolating that she cannot have children.  That\u2019s a huge stretch and further, OP never said anything about the person\u2019s ability to procreate rather than objecting to her false equivalency of pet ownership and raising a human.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA, I suspect all the folks saying you are don't have kids. Which I also don't have kids - I'm a devoted dog and cat mom. Puppy owners didn't have to endure changes to their bodies and potential tearing. Puppy owners don't have to have their tits get enlarged and literally leak milk at the sound of a baby crying. Puppy owners (unless a tiny rescue) usually don't have to get up multiple times in a night to hand feed their puppy out of a bottle or from their boobs directly. Puppy owners can put a whining puppy in another room and use ear plugs for the sound where new parents HAVE to get up to attend to the newborn. I know some of these are mom specific but Dad's have to do so much to assist. \n\nTo equate those experiences is both ignorant and insulting. I would NEVER say that to a new parent.", "NTA OP, everyone stating you are is delusional. Owning a pet and raising a kid are not even remotely the same, and for her to say so is just plain dipshittery on her part.", "YTA \n\nwas it neccesary to be so agressive?  I know there are situations where people compare animals to human and maybe a lot of them are inappropiate, but this wasn't the case\n\nwith only 1 year old, a human and a dog can do almost the same thing, an even not being the same specie, the responsability you have with both are pretty similar\n\nand even it that wasn't the case, with that comment you're creating a very hostile workplace. from the point of view of that girl you've been innecessarily cruel and mean...", "YTA - Sheesh kick someone down for trying to have some empathy why don't ya", "I've had both...and they are, in fact similar.  Babies, obviously, are more intense but puppies are supper demanding too.\n\nIt's a shame you didn't cotton on to a good opportunity to team build rather than one-up.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. This is why I choose the child free life.  It's not the kids,  it's the super annoying and self-absorbed parents.", "YTA for the way you handled this. Yes, you're correct that pets are not the same as children, but your response was inappropriate for the workplace and also somewhat inaccurate. \n\nFirst of all, no, not all dogs are purchased at a store. Many of them are rescues, and yes that includes puppies.\n\nSecond of all, where the pets come from is irrelevant anyway. Do you think that people who adopt children are less of a parent than people who give birth?\n\nThird of all, this is your coworker, not your friend. When you're insulted by the things people say in the work environment, unless it's clear-cut harassment/against office policy, it's wise to keep it to yourself or just laugh it off. She wasn't harassing you, she just made a dumb, tone-deaf remark. You didn't need to tell her that you found it \"insulting.\" But now you've created a mountain out of a molehill and she doesn't want to work with you.\n\nNow, one thing I do want to state, though - I do have empathy for you because you mentioned you're dealing with a newborn. I realize there is a ton of stress and sleeplessness that comes with that, so maybe you were not in the right mindset when you made this remark to her. If I were you, I would just let her know that you're stressed and apologize.", "I think she was just trying to find common ground. There\u2019s a real possibility that she\u2019s experienced infertility or loss of a pregnancy, you never know.", "YTA\n\nDogs do not equal children, but she was trying to relate to you and be nice. There's a reason why couples typically get a puppy a year or two before trying to have kids, because it's a somewhat similar experience and helps prepare you for having children.\n\nIf she pushed you and said \"oh it's the same thing!\" then I would say NTA, but you were rude to her when she was just talking to you.", "YTA for that response. It was rude and uncalled for.", "I get that YOU think it's not the same but SHE DOES and she was only trying to make a connection. Instead you outright insulted her, continued to embarrass her with a diatribe about your own opinions at work with others around, and make her feel like she's working in a hostile environment enough that she's putting in a request to not have to work with you (which is HER prerogative). \n\nYTA, dude. It takes NO EFFORT to just be nice to begin with and very little to apologize to keep the peace in a work environment even if you don't think you're in the wrong. If that goes against your dude-code to be superior in every situation, you can't be offended when people don't want to be around you. \n\nAnd, yes, I don't have bio kids (because I don't want them) but have plenty of furbabies and they're just as important to me and my life as your bio kids are to your life. Get over it.", "lol, YTA. she was being nice to you, you weirdo.", "NTA because being a dog parent is NOT the same as parenting a child. But YTA for how you responded to her.

She said she knew \"a bit\" about what OP is going through, which is completely true. She does know \"a bit\" since getting a new puppy is \"a bit\" like having a newborn. You get woken up at odd times and have to deal with some slightly similar things when you get a puppy.", "Sounds like one of those people who thinks they should be revered for procreating.

What\u2019s so different?", "> I also find it hilarious that your retort was that she \"just went to the store\" to buy her dog, considering that she likely put in more physical effort into that than you did in making in your child. Your wife has more reason to be offended.\n\nMy wife and I are considering getting our 1st dog, and I'm frankly scared of the horror stories people have shared about what shelters and fosters put people through to determine if they're \"worthy\" of adopting one of their dogs.", "I'd give you an award if I had one to give.

And am honest and your statement is ridiculous. A baby is 24/7. You can\u2019t put your baby in a crate for the night. You can\u2019t run to to store, you can\u2019t even shower sometimes. It\u2019s not even close to comparable. Plus the fact that puppy doesn\u2019t mess up your hormones making everything even more difficult for the first little while. You throw food in a bowl for a puppy, you have to literally feed a baby. A baby takes up so much more time and energy. You don\u2019t get to sleep through the night. You\u2019re more tired and stressed. I can\u2019t believe anyone would think it\u2019s remotely close. People that have never had babies I guess", "Ah.  Ur right, she was just trying to empathize....  but there are people out there who truly believe taking care of dogs is the same as taking care of kids", "Tremendous amount of work yes, but still not the same is all I'm saying.

I thought it was a late and heavy period. But, since I had called after taking the test (the line took forever to show up and it was faint) I went in where they drew blood and confirmed that I was pregnant and lost it. My ob was wonderful about it. She examined me and reassured me that it was nothing I did wrong and went over the possibilities of what could have happened. My cycle was never the same after that, though, and my periods got heavier and heavier as time went on. 4 years ago I got a hysterectomy because I had a fibroid the size of a golf ball!"]}
