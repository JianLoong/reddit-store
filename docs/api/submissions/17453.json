It took me longer to deal with this than I expected but finally, I think I found a solution. Several people asked for an update so here it is:   \nI attempted to talk to my father again but at this point I am assuming that a lot of the comments were right about them just wanting ME to deal with my brother in their place. I took time off my work schedule to pack his shit together and waited for him to crash here after work again (since I still needed the key back). Looking back, probably not the best move, but I was stressed and tired. It was an awful fight but it did end with him eventually leaving my apartment and returning my keys. The reason I didn't get the locks changed is because my landlord reminded me that this could be very expensive - and she wouldn't cover the cost for me. It's been several days and my brother has not contacted me since, nor attempted to enter my apartment. I am still considering changing the locks and might do so soon with my landlords permission and covering the cost myself. But it seems I have my space back.   \nThe thing that really bothers me is how my relationship with my parents suddenly suffered so much from this. My initial reaction when I asked them to help me throw out my brother, and my dad responding with the apartment switch was that they couldn't be serious - apparently they were. My mom did talk to me this week and said since I am on good terms with my landlord I could figure something out - its completely ridiclous and almost comically evil at this point. I told her that that's not how renting a space works... I don't even know if this is pure entitlement or ego - doesn't matter though, I decided to lower contact with them over this, until they find out what they did wrong.  \n\nRegardless if they do or don't, my family are not the main characters of my life and I am done with being a doormat to them. It took some encouragement to stand up for myself and I wanna thank everyone who gave it to me :)", "created_utc": 1684321729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jym58/aita_for_not_moving_out_of_my_apartment_so_my/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Original post here https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13afch6/aita_for_not_moving_out_of_my_apartment_so_my/", "You handled this just right.\n\nI would at least find out what changing the lock would cost. You can usually just change part of it, and it's fairly easy to do it yourself. It's a valuable life skill. I took my own lock from home to home for a few years.", "Good for you OP. It\u2019s not your job to help your brother. He is 30 and you are not his parent nor his caretaker.. not your fault your folks did a bad job preparing him for the world.", "I'm happy you finally got you apartment back !", "Congratulations and well done! I\u2019ll share my view : your parents were keen as heck to get your 32 year old brother out of their house, even if it meant throwing you under the bus.", "> until they find out what they did wrong.\n\nThey won't by themselves. Anway: Glad to hear you managed the situation! Keep it up!", "Thank god you stood your ground. I was rooting for you! I'm happy that you are feeling better now and I hope you will continue to thrive.", "It\u2019s super easy to change the locks yourself.  There\u2019s plenty of YouTube videos to show you how to do it locks themselves are not that expensive you can get a real fancy one for $100 or you can get just a basic one for $20.  Good luck and congratulations on getting your brother out of your place.", "Good for you for standing up for yourself! Hopefully your parents will see reason over time and your brother sorts himself out, although that seems quite unlikely!", "You do know you can change your locks yourself, right?\n\nYou need the new locks, a screw driver, and the ability to read and follow basic instructions.\n\nA power drill would be helpful but is not necessary", "Well it's a rental... I can't just change the locks without asking my landlord"]}
