It took me longer to deal with this than I expected but finally, I think I found a solution. Several people asked for an update so here it is:   \nI attempted to talk to my father again but at this point I am assuming that a lot of the comments were right about them just wanting ME to deal with my brother in their place. I took time off my work schedule to pack his shit together and waited for him to crash here after work again (since I still needed the key back). Looking back, probably not the best move, but I was stressed and tired. It was an awful fight but it did end with him eventually leaving my apartment and returning my keys. The reason I didn't get the locks changed is because my landlord reminded me that this could be very expensive - and she wouldn't cover the cost for me. It's been several days and my brother has not contacted me since, nor attempted to enter my apartment. I am still considering changing the locks and might do so soon with my landlords permission and covering the cost myself. But it seems I have my space back.   \nThe thing that really bothers me is how my relationship with my parents suddenly suffered so much from this. My initial reaction when I asked them to help me throw out my brother, and my dad responding with the apartment switch was that they couldn't be serious - apparently they were. My mom did talk to me this week and said since I am on good terms with my landlord I could figure something out - its completely ridiclous and almost comically evil at this point. I told her that that's not how renting a space works... I don't even know if this is pure entitlement or ego - doesn't matter though, I decided to lower contact with them over this, until they find out what they did wrong.  \n\nRegardless if they do or don't, my family are not the main characters of my life and I am done with being a doormat to them. It took some encouragement to stand up for myself and I wanna thank everyone who gave it to me :)", "created_utc": 1684321729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jym58/aita_for_not_moving_out_of_my_apartment_so_my/", "score": 908, "replies": ["Original post here https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13afch6/aita_for_not_moving_out_of_my_apartment_so_my/", "You handled this just right.\n\nI would at least find out what changing the lock or *re-keying it would cost. You can usually just change part of it, and it's fairly easy to do it yourself. It's a valuable life skill. I took my own lock from home to home for a few years.", "Good for you OP. It\u2019s not your job to help your brother. He is 30 and you are not his parent nor his caretaker.. not your fault your folks did a bad job preparing him for the world.", "I'm happy you finally got you apartment back !", "Congratulations and well done! I\u2019ll share my view : your parents were keen as heck to get your 32 year old brother out of their house, even if it meant throwing you under the bus.", "> until they find out what they did wrong.\n\nThey won't by themselves. Anway: Glad to hear you managed the situation! Keep it up!", "Thank god you stood your ground. I was rooting for you! I'm happy that you are feeling better now and I hope you will continue to thrive.", "It\u2019s super easy to change the locks yourself.  There\u2019s plenty of YouTube videos to show you how to do it locks themselves are not that expensive you can get a real fancy one for $100 or you can get just a basic one for $20.  Good luck and congratulations on getting your brother out of your place.", "Good for you for standing up for yourself! Hopefully your parents will see reason over time and your brother sorts himself out, although that seems quite unlikely!", "You do know you can change your locks yourself, right?\n\nYou need the new locks, a screw driver, and the ability to read and follow basic instructions.\n\nA power drill would be helpful but is not necessary", "Well it's a rental... I can't just change the locks without asking my landlord", "Good for you! \n\nIt does sound like your parents were pawning your brother off on you, hence why he still isn\u2019t growing up enough\u2026and he\u2019s so much older than you.\n\nThey will get over it, just make sure you take care of yourself first.", "Well done! I don't think you need to change your keylock, you took him by surprise. He was probably entitled enough to believe he had a right to slowly take over your place (and probably didn't mind having you there, someone has to keep it nice and tidy), so he didn't think you would question the arrangement and therefore didn't make another key.", "Good for you! I\u2019m proud of you OP.", "NTA your parents are playing pass the parcel or in this case a 32 year old layabout\u2026take the $ hit and change the locks IMO", "I love this so much for you.  \nThank you for the update. \n\nI hope you have a peaceful and prosper life going on :)", "Good on you for standing up for yourself! A cheap doorbell camera off Amazon may help if he tries to come back. Stand your ground and shine up that spine!", "Just because they're family doesn't mean you have to tolerate crap.  \nBeing there myself.\n\nLets be frank, you're bro ain't a kid no more and your parents needs to understand that its not your job to keep propping him up at your expense.", "Congratulations op! You deserve a good life. Your family can kick rocks.", "Good job standing up for yourself, OP!", "Yeah you handled this as well as you could've.  You are not your brother's caretake and yes your parents did hope they would get rid of him if you gave him your apartment and you would find something else.  \n\n\nDepending on what kinds of locks you have the changing could be as cheap as few bucks and one screw. I have kinda standard lock on my door so when I bought my apartment I swapped the lock for few $ in fer minutes.  \n\n\nThat won't be as easy if you have some sort of safety lock but I think it might be good idea to change them anyway just for safety.", "Good for you. Your parents didn't think you would do it so they didn't get involved. This way it was how they wanted it. Now that you kicked him out, they want to get involved. Don't let them. Be proud of yourself", "I know I\u2019m just an internet stranger but I still want to say I\u2019m so damn proud of you for standing up for yourself and not letting then walk all over you.", "You don\u2019t owe them or him your life. He is a big boy it\u2019s time for him to figure his sh*t out. Not your problem. Good for you!", ">I didn't get the locks changed is because my landlord reminded me that this could be very expensive - and she wouldn't cover the cost for me.\n\nYou can DIY changing locks and/or rekeying them.  Home Depot has a rekey kit for $10.  I'm sure YT has a walkthrough somewhere.", "NTA and good for you.", "Thank you for standing up for yourself!", "I'm glad you got him out. You can get your peace back. As far as your parents, I hope they figure their crap out. But, if they don't, you still have a full life. I would probably put up a security camera in your place in case your brother made a spare. Then, you can catch him trespassing. Good luck with everything.", "I would definitely change the locks, get a small camera installed at your door (with permission from landlord / neighbors, and if there is any way only your front door area is covered) and maybe even consider a restraining order from now. If he does try to break in, with or without your parents, you already have that restraining order, there's already a paper trail. That way, you're definitely covered.", "NTA and new locks are at any hardware store for like $40. Get a new lock and give your land lord a key copy.", "Changing locks is super cheap. Home depot, $20 and 10 min to change.", "Good for you. Continue to hold your boundaries. Do not let them try to manipulate you into believing they\u2019ve changed until they show it with actions by respecting your boundaries. Good luck.", "Thanks for the update!", "atta girl! standing your ground with your brother and your parents takes guts and resolve - not many people can do what you did. three cheers for you this morning!", "Here's what I would do because I believe that, for the sake of sanity and peace and not being demonized for something that is an egregious ask, this is a situation that calls for a little white lie;\n\nI would say that I spoke with my landlord *(and I would tell your landlord beforehand so she can back you up)* and **she said NO**, that **she** **will be the person to choose all future tenants,** and furthermore that it is not *my* place to simply decide who gets to live there next, that if I give up my apartment she already has people in mind with whom she has developed a rapport and is confident that she'd enjoy them as tenants.\n\nAnd if I were a landlord I would absolutely feel ~~thgis~~ this way, I would definitely not allow a tenant to decide who the next tenant is going to be, and I'd be suspicious that they even suggested usurping my power.\n\nYour parents offloaded their son onto you and made it your problem so turnabout is fair play. It's not a malicious lie, it is merely a small lie to ward off what is an exceedingly unfair demand of you and your own home.\n\nEdit: See strikethrough", "This is your parents trying to make you take care of your brother's issues because they don't want to try to navigate it themselves.", "Hi, OP! \n\nI didn\u2019t see your original post. After reading it and this update, I\u2019m happy that you were able to get your space back. I\u2019d definitely look into getting the locks changed on the chance that your brother may have made a copy of the key. You deserve to have your own space.", "Glad to hear your update and that you got a bit of needed support.\n\nI'm sorry that your parents have turned out to be so selfish and lazy regarding your brother. Even if you are clearly independent and capable, it still hurts to be let down by your family. The LC is probably a good thing while the question of \"what to do with their son\" comes to a head and they are forced to deal with it.\n\nKeep building your life for you. Don't know you, but I'm kinda' proud of you!", "Don\u2019t have the locks changed. You can just have them re-Keyed for a much lower price.", "Nta and good for you. I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t tell you to find a new place and to pay for both of them so he could live rent free. And well your parents are ah. Good for you for standing your ground and kicking him out. If you change the lock yourself it might be helpful. And until things settle down maybe get a camera for the door for piece of mind.", "So happy you stood up for yourself!!! Be proud that u did and continue to do so!!", "Here's a low-cost idea: Just add a deadbolt, and give the landlord a copy of the key. Set the deadbolt every time you leave the apartment so that your brother can't break in.", "I am so happy for you!  Great job standing up for yourself- proud of you!", "I\u2019m so proud of you! I know it can\u2019t have been easy to stand up for yourself like that, but you did it anyway! That\u2019s amazing! I hope you enjoy so much peace in your cozy apartment that you\u2019ve now officially decolonized.", "Good job, OP. Very proud of you.", "Also it may be cheaper to just have the lock rekeyed.", "I've had friends who are handy install new locks for me. I just bought a good lock and they installed it in exchange for pizza and beer. Total cost was maybe 30 ish dollars.", "OP, congrats on standing up for yourself!", ">rekeyed\n\nThank you,  that's exactly  the word I was looking for. You just change the barrel or some such component. Cheap and easy.", "Yeah, just did mine for $30. USD last week", "I did it as a 20-something by myself and it was pretty easy. Just ask your landlord if you can have the locks changed - he doesn't need to know you're the one doing it. You'll still have to buy the lock but it's a lot better than hiring someone to do it.", "You asked, they said they wouldn\u2019t pay, did they say you couldn\u2019t do it?", "It may not be so simple if you have a lock system in an apartment building where one key opens the front door and also your apartment. Looks like this could be the case here. Those systems are often tied to a specific locks company who have to come, change your lock and issue new keys for the system.", "Then I'll ask again and tell her I'll cover the cost and look into doing it myself :) thanks for the tip!", ">he doesn't need to know you're the one doing it.\n\nExactly. And all you have to do is make sure the landlord has a copy of the key.", "No that's why I'll ask again - I didn't think me doing the lock myself was an option since I've never done that", "Yes, that's a huge pain to do, and requires a pro, and is expensive as hell.", "This is good suggestion", "You got this! We're all more capable than we think we are. I learn this lesson time and time again.", "You don\u2019t have to physically take off the old lock and have a new one installed. Just get the existing lock rekeyed which your landlord should do between tenants anyway.", "OP....YouTube is your best friend.  I learned how to fix my new expensive microwave, fix the gaping hole in my shower and re-install and rewire a ceiling light from YouTube.   You are much more capable than you realize.", "And if you look it up and it doesn\u2019t feel easy enough, you can get your locks re-keyed quite cheaply! Source: I\u2019ve had to do this when our landlady\u2019s daughter/unofficial property manager became aggressively unhinged and we needed to be safe. O.o", "Just make sure to give her a copy, that's really all they care about.", "And that your brother definitely doesn't.", "They should but I've never lived in an apartment where the landlord (individual or apt complex) actually did this.", "Yeah you're probably right I just have to put some work into it! :)", "And your parents don\u2019t get one either", "We discovered that the entire row of new homes here used one key. The builder never switched out the locks. I assume my key will work on the new street they\u2019ve just completed, too."]}
