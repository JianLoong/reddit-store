It took me longer to deal with this than I expected but finally, I think I found a solution. Several people asked for an update so here it is:   \nI attempted to talk to my father again but at this point I am assuming that a lot of the comments were right about them just wanting ME to deal with my brother in their place. I took time off my work schedule to pack his shit together and waited for him to crash here after work again (since I still needed the key back). Looking back, probably not the best move, but I was stressed and tired. It was an awful fight but it did end with him eventually leaving my apartment and returning my keys. The reason I didn't get the locks changed is because my landlord reminded me that this could be very expensive - and she wouldn't cover the cost for me. It's been several days and my brother has not contacted me since, nor attempted to enter my apartment. I am still considering changing the locks and might do so soon with my landlords permission and covering the cost myself. But it seems I have my space back.   \nThe thing that really bothers me is how my relationship with my parents suddenly suffered so much from this. My initial reaction when I asked them to help me throw out my brother, and my dad responding with the apartment switch was that they couldn't be serious - apparently they were. My mom did talk to me this week and said since I am on good terms with my landlord I could figure something out - its completely ridiclous and almost comically evil at this point. I told her that that's not how renting a space works... I don't even know if this is pure entitlement or ego - doesn't matter though, I decided to lower contact with them over this, until they find out what they did wrong.  \n\nRegardless if they do or don't, my family are not the main characters of my life and I am done with being a doormat to them. It took some encouragement to stand up for myself and I wanna thank everyone who gave it to me :)", "created_utc": 1684321729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jym58/aita_for_not_moving_out_of_my_apartment_so_my/", "score": 6040, "replies": ["Original post here https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13afch6/aita_for_not_moving_out_of_my_apartment_so_my/", "You handled this just right.\n\nI would at least find out what changing the lock or *re-keying it would cost.

Very proud of you.", "Also it may be cheaper to just have the lock rekeyed.", "I've had friends who are handy install new locks for me.

And all you have to do is make sure the landlord has a copy of the key.", "No that's why I'll ask again - I didn't think me doing the lock myself was an option since I've never done that", "Yes, that's a huge pain to do, and requires a pro, and is expensive as hell.", "This is good suggestion", "You got this! We're all more capable than we think we are. I learn this lesson time and time again.", "You don\u2019t have to physically take off the old lock and have a new one installed.

With two metal cylinders in each hole. A spring presses them down. When you insert a key, you're making the first metal cylinder in each hole even with the top of the plug, allowing it to freely rotate. \n\nThese metal cylinders are specific numerical size. Your key is basically a 5 or 6 number \"password\" corresponding to those numbers. Which is why you don't want to ever post photos of your keys. Someone can guess the number values and print another key.\n\nA master key system has three metal cylinders. They both do the same job, getting those cylinders lined up with the top of the plug so it can turn. The master key can open any of the coded locks, but user keys can only open their lock.

You said he would treat you like your mom when he was over which means he definitely still treats your mom that way when he\u2019s there. Your parents are upset with you because you stuck their 32 year old son back with them. But they chose to have a kid.

I normally arrange it. \n\nEven though locks are super easy to install people do stuff it up, when the door breaks it becomes my problem. This had actually happened, I've paid for an emergency call out and lock replacement, it would have been cheaper for me to just change the lock for them.\n\nAsk your landlord about options. If you're willing to pay make that clear but just be aware they might to be happy with a DIY job if there is a great risk of further cost in the future if the job goes bad.\n\nLastly landlords are stingy bastards, they'll know the cheapest locksmith, if that locksmith stuffs up, it's not your problem.", "High security?

Enjoy your space", "I wouldn\u2019t bother tip toeing around the situation. The parents are being completely ridiculous, expecting their younger daughter to give up her first apartment to her older brother whose had plenty of time to get his own place. I personally think it\u2019s good that she put her foot down. The parents and brother should know that what they\u2019re asking and how they\u2019re acting is unreasonable and unacceptable. I don\u2019t think OP should have to walk on eggshells around her family her whole life. If she makes excuses, they might not ever respect her boundaries and she\u2019ll end up indirectly enabling this behavior. They are not considering her feelings at all. It\u2019s not okay that they withhold their love and affection because she isn\u2019t doing exactly what they want. I don\u2019t think she needs any excuse at all. Sometimes it\u2019s better to have lower contact with family if the family is toxic.", "No need to lie. Most landlords wouldn't let him even move in with you without an application and background check. He's not even on the lease. If OP moved out, they wouldn't automatically let the brother have it, especially when they already know about him.

As long as you have the key with you, they will change it for $10 each and hand it back to you with brand new keys.", "What is this thing you're talking about?

One day, I was taking a shower when I heard the front door open. I yelled out and a woman quickly replied it was the management and shut the door. When I got out of the shower, I found that she left so quickly that she didn't lock it. I called the management office and got a voice mail with the same voice as the person who opened my door. I complained to the head office and within days, she was gone.

She's asking and sometimes replies are better sent in a direct message. :)", "Oh thank you!", "Then I would obviously have someone I trust watching my home (probably staying there) and I would let them know I got an email stating they needed access to fix something urgent.

I have been wondering how this story ended, thank you for the update.\n\nYou did the right thing.

So happy you got your safe space back and are standing up for yourself.", "A lot if landlords use rental companies.", "This is the way", "You are absolutely correct.

I'm pretty sure you don't have a copy of my insurance policy, but my landlord does.\n\nI've had to make claims before, so I'm well aware of what is and isn't covered, and most disasters that would require entry wouldn't be by my landlord, it'd probably be firemen or public works.\n\nAfter a PMC staffer used a \"borrowed\" key to attempt burglarizing my home, probably thinking my graveyard-shift ass was asleep or not at home.
