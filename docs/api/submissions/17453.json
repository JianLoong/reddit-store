It took me longer to deal with this than I expected but finally, I think I found a solution. Several people asked for an update so here it is:   \nI attempted to talk to my father again but at this point I am assuming that a lot of the comments were right about them just wanting ME to deal with my brother in their place. I took time off my work schedule to pack his shit together and waited for him to crash here after work again (since I still needed the key back). Looking back, probably not the best move, but I was stressed and tired. It was an awful fight but it did end with him eventually leaving my apartment and returning my keys. The reason I didn't get the locks changed is because my landlord reminded me that this could be very expensive - and she wouldn't cover the cost for me. It's been several days and my brother has not contacted me since, nor attempted to enter my apartment. I am still considering changing the locks and might do so soon with my landlords permission and covering the cost myself. But it seems I have my space back.   \nThe thing that really bothers me is how my relationship with my parents suddenly suffered so much from this. My initial reaction when I asked them to help me throw out my brother, and my dad responding with the apartment switch was that they couldn't be serious - apparently they were. My mom did talk to me this week and said since I am on good terms with my landlord I could figure something out - its completely ridiclous and almost comically evil at this point. I told her that that's not how renting a space works... I don't even know if this is pure entitlement or ego - doesn't matter though, I decided to lower contact with them over this, until they find out what they did wrong.  \n\nRegardless if they do or don't, my family are not the main characters of my life and I am done with being a doormat to them. It took some encouragement to stand up for myself and I wanna thank everyone who gave it to me :)", "created_utc": 1684321729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jym58/aita_for_not_moving_out_of_my_apartment_so_my/", "score": 2290, "replies": ["Original post here https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13afch6/aita_for_not_moving_out_of_my_apartment_so_my/", "You handled this just right.\n\nI would at least find out what changing the lock or *re-keying it would cost.

Very proud of you.", "Also it may be cheaper to just have the lock rekeyed.", "I've had friends who are handy install new locks for me.

And all you have to do is make sure the landlord has a copy of the key.", "No that's why I'll ask again - I didn't think me doing the lock myself was an option since I've never done that", "Yes, that's a huge pain to do, and requires a pro, and is expensive as hell.", "This is good suggestion", "You got this! We're all more capable than we think we are. I learn this lesson time and time again.", "You don\u2019t have to physically take off the old lock and have a new one installed.

With two metal cylinders in each hole. A spring presses them down. When you insert a key, you're making the first metal cylinder in each hole even with the top of the plug, allowing it to freely rotate. \n\nThese metal cylinders are specific numerical size. Your key is basically a 5 or 6 number \"password\" corresponding to those numbers. Which is why you don't want to ever post photos of your keys. Someone can guess the number values and print another key.\n\nA master key system has three metal cylinders.
