We\u2019ve been together for five years and married for one. \nI\u2019ve always wanted to carry my own kids and my wife absolutely does not. I feel like it would be a beautiful thing to carry her eggs and therefore have our kids be her genetics and my blood. It was my idea originally, but my wife is 100% on board and loves the idea. Also I just want to say I don\u2019t think carrying a baby or dna makes a family, I think love does. \n\nMy mom has had some issues over the course of our relationship, to say the least.\nShe came from a broken family and has put a lot of her expectations on me (her only daughter), and therefore was not overjoyed when I came out as bisexual. She and I have had a lot of disagreements over gender, sexuality, and the role family should play in a life. \n\nSo now to today, my wife and I were having a nice conversation with my mother about the possibility of us having kids and we mentioned to her that we would like for me to carry my wife\u2019s eggs. My mom sort of did a double take and then proceeded to slyly kind of try and talk us out of it. We kind of laughed it off and she started acting weird and eventually left the room. \n\nA little later, I went into her room and asked her if everything was OK. She said no and tried to shut down the conversation. \nI probably shouldn\u2019t have but I asked her if it was about our conversation about kids earlier and she said \u201cabsolutely.\u201d I started to try and explain to her how it was our decision and we thought it was beautiful but she interrupted me and told me that if I wanted to cut her and my dad\u2018s DNA out of the my future family than I can.\nI told her that genetics are not what make a family and I have brothers who will likely carry on the DNA anyway. \nShe got upset and said that if my wife wanted \u201cher babies\u201c then \u201cshe can carry them herself\u201c she said that she was upset that I would  take on the health risks of pregnancy and while she didn\u2019t finish the sentence it sounded like she was going to say that my wife would be the one getting the glory. \nI reiterated that regardless of the DNA or who carried my children they would still be my children and her grandchildren. I told her that I hoped she would treat them as such. \nShe said that she would \u201ctreat\u201d them as her grandkids. \nI proceeded to get very upset and tell her that she needed to talk to people and do some research.\nI kept telling her that genes and blood don\u2019t make a family, and she told me that I was \u201ccondescending\u201d her.\n\nI believe I might be the asshole for not even considering my parents wishes to continue their DNA.\n\nI am worried I am the asshole because my mother seemed deeply troubled and upset by this and told me that it was absurd and it made me question whether I\u2019m making the right decision.", "created_utc": 1671661859, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zs3iqt/aita_for_wanting_to_use_my_wifes_dna_to_get/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her genes are no more important than your wife\u2019s; by this logic, why should her gene pool die out and your mothers shouldn\u2019t? The most important thing is that this is *your* decision with *your* bodies- not hers. She does not own you or your future children.\n\nThe fact that her first reaction to hearing that she was going to become a grandmother was to get upset because she\u2019s not directly involved by blood is uncomfortable; would she be this way if you two decided to adopt instead? Your moms feelings are not your responsibility. She\u2019s a grown woman and if she wants to be upset over something that isn\u2019t a problem, then she can be upset. That\u2019s her choice.", "NTA.

Family is about love.\n\nYou and your wife agree that the course you want to take for *your* family is her fertilized egg carried to term by you.

Nothing is being taken from her and her opinion truly does not matter.", "NTA !!!! \n\nI think you and your wife\u2019s plan is amazing ! \nAnd who says you won\u2019t have a baby with your eggs down the road ? \n\nBut regardless of whether you want one kid or more- your parents should not be deciding anything .. it\u2019s your life and your marriage, they can not dictate how that looks.", "i think it is the most perfect way to have a child in a f-f relationship. Wish you all the best", "Nta, the only opinions that matter are yours, your partners, and the medical professionals when it comes to talking about any extra risks etc", " NTA. Your mom is being ridiculous about this. She does not get to dictate your reproductive choices. Do what makes you and your wife happy.", "YTA. *but not for your parenting idea.* \n\nYTA for not letting your mother have her space. She was upset by what she heard, and instead of reacting or arguing before she had a chance to process her emotions, she wisely left the room. You pursued her, and when she tried to \"shut down the conversation,\"  you forced an argument on her.", "You are NTA. Your mother can choose to be supportive or not. It is not your responsibility to base your family around her wishes and DNA biases.", "NTA \n\nIt's your relationship and your body, and if you want to carry your wife's eggs, you have every right to do so. Who knows, you might want another child after the first one, where you use your eggs. At the end of the day your mum is going to get a grandchild, and hopefully she treats it as she would her own 'blood'. \n\nHer wish to 'carry on the line' shouldn't be a consideration in the decision you and your wife make to have a child, and, as you've pointed out, your brothers have that aspect covered, so to me it seems your mum is being a little bit selfish. You don't know if she's saying this because she means it or because she's always had trouble accepting your sexuality and relationship, and while you can take her wishes into account, it's really none of her business how you choose to have a child. \n\nYour mum is obviously having trouble letting go of the expectations she had for and put on you. She was probably dreaming of the day you got married to a man, you getting pregnant, her providing her motherly wisdom for nine months, and doting on her only daughter's child, who would in turn ensure the continuation of the family line. Now, she might feel like it's another blow, as the realities of your life get further and further away from the future she envisioned for you. But that's her issue and it's for her to come to terms with, without trying to sway you from your decision.", "Yeah sooo NTA! It\u2019s your body, your kids, your genes. Your purpose in life is not to propagate your family\u2019s bloodline. It is to build a life that brings you fulfillment and happiness. Do what is right for you and if your mother keeps giving you issues tell her to f right off!", "NTA. Your baby, your choice. Propogating the family DNA is such an old fashioned idea anyway, the baby will be family however you choose to have it. Your mum may change her mind when the baby arrives. They are magical things babies.", "NTA but I'd be worried if the relationship ended. You might not get custody or even visitation without DNA. I recently saw a case like that. Of course it also depends on the State you're .\n\nAs for your parents,  could you use fertilized eggs from both of you? That way it's up to fate.", "Oh, ouch. I'm sorry.\n\nNTA.\n\nIt sounds to me as though, despite her difficulties, y'all have an open dialogue. Considering you're not even at the retrieval stage yet, I hope she'll educate herself and move through the stages to acceptance and eventually anticipation quickly. This doesn't sound like a lost cause at all.", "NTA. Omglob so NTA. Your mom is uugghh... Your mom basically said her (your) DNA is more important than your spouses. What a narcissistic thing to express to you. \n\nDismissing your spouse, and your future family before it's even a reality is next level awful. \n\nI firmly believe that you and your spouse need to draw up boundaries of what you will not tolerate from her / anyone as you move forward on your journey into parenthood.  This isn't about them. She's trying to make it about her. Don't for one second even consider her thoughts or feelings, they don't matter. She lost that right when she was an AH about you being bi. \n\nThe only thing that matters is whatever you and your wife want. Nothing else.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s up to you and your partner how you choose to bring children into the world.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think your mom is necessarily being ridiculous.  Blood ties do matter to some people.  It\u2019s kinda similar to why couples who have trouble conceiving and with fertility still don\u2019t want to adopt.  It just matters that the child belongs to them biologically.\n\nI think your mom is being too emotional over a kid she\u2019s not even carrying or giving birth to, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t understand her a little bit.", "NTA. Just don't tell her anything more about your plans. She doesn't get a say.", "Oh, good grief, your mother is grabbing unhappiness with both hands.  NTA, absolutely.  I\u2019ve heard of other couples where one carries the babies, from her partner\u2019s eggs.  Makes total sense, if you can afford the procedure!  Not that you need it to make sense to anyone but yourself, of course. It\u2019s just easy to see why the idea appeals.", "> I feel like it would be a beautiful thing to carry her eggs and therefore have our kids be her genetics and my blood.\n\nYou realize that's...not how it works, right? Babies don't inherit blood, they inherit genetics.\n\nAll that said, NTA. You are free to do with your body as you please, but I'd give your mom some chance to get over this - it would be surprising to a lot of older people, so I wouldn't judge her to harshly if she needs a few weeks to accept it.", "NAH\n\nPregnancy is not without risk and in vitro surrogacy increases those risks. \n\n\nI am just guessing here, but it seems like your mom's brain jumped to worst case scenarios (is she like that?) If you die in childbirth she will have nothing left of you and no legal footing with the child and your wife could cut her out and and and...(is she the type to spiral) If so, I would advise that you ignore her and do what seems best to you.", "NTA.  Your family, your choice.  Sounds a lot like your mother is extremely biased and homophobic and does not like the idea of the family you are creating.  I love the idea for you carrying your wifes eggs as it will bond all of you closer together.  If your mother has a problem with that, then it is her problem not yours.  Yes she is an important party of your life, but your future life with your partner and future child come first here and her \"wishes\" do not.", "Have 2 kids then one with your egg and one with her egg then you have everyone covered and a good sized family", "NTA at all \n\nThis is a beautiful way for you and your wife to both be involved. Also, who is to say if you both might want another child down the line and maybe that one is your egg?
