You are completely in the right here.\n\nAsk your mom why it's more important to her to post photos on social media than it is for her to respect such a simple boundary. \n\nI understand that parents go to the hilt when it comes to their kids in competative events (especially sports) - and I'm sure she's proud of you for being on the swim team and participating in the meet and wants to share photos of her kid being awesome. None of that is bad or makes her TA.

It's called assumption of privacy and those of us that have worked as photographers know exactly what it means. However, one would assume that one's mother would have some compassion for the way her own child feels about having those images shared on Facebook. Furthermore, schools now allow kids to not sign the consent form to use their images for the school.

Loves posing for pics, asks me 'did you post it yet mum?' And later on 'has anyone commented, can I see?'     \nMostly just relatives saying how cute she is (she's 9).          \nShe does a competitive sport too and likes having her podium pictures posted. \nI'm sure the day will come when that changes and she too starts to turn her face away in photos, then she'll get the same respect as her sister.       \nNot difficult at all.", "Here here!", "You made it sound like OP should just be happy, which implies they are miserable for standing up for their boundaries.

You did. \n\nSomeone saying they love you, is NEVER an excuse to violate your consent, or boundaries. Period. Full stop. \n\nThere are no exceptions to that.

End of discussion. It's not a complicated concept.", "I think you did, actually.", "Wedding photographer actually. I can assume by the fact that the mother was taking pictures of her talking to the coach that parents taking pictures at these events is not frowned upon. Those signed photo consents would only be for the school and them publishing the images. So if another parent took a picture of their kid and OP was in the back, there is nothing to prevent that.\n\nNow certain social media platforms allow people to report the photo to get the picture taken down. It all depends where it's posted. But no those photo consents are only for things like the school website or yearbook, not the random parent that took a picture.", "I mean, I have a child in a competitive sport, 2 in school who have events, and my job is running family activity days, I spend my entire life signing or chasing up photographic consent forms.       \nWhich bit is incorrect?", "Jfc, you're really overthinking it. I was only trying to give a point of view of their mom, who loves them, that's all. A lot of people don't, clearly 99% of the people on Reddit have parents who don't love them, so yes they are lucky.

They did all have to sign the consent form for the yearbook though. I honestly wish more schools would do what your child's school does. After all, if OPs school was like that we wouldn't be here because her mom wouldn't be able to boundary stomp as often as she does!", "Boundaries boundaries boundaries boundaries, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. You know the more you repeat it the less important it becomes right", "It's great because the coaches get better pics than we would as they're up close, we can just watch and enjoy without worrying about taking photos, and we can download or share the photos put on social media.           \nI do take a photo outside with just my kid and her medal and trophy, then another with her and her 2 best friends that go, but the good pics, the action shots and podium pictures are taken by the coaches.", "I'm sorry if my formal education in developmental psychology, and knowledge of the very real, and serious consequences to lifelong relationship habits, and attachment styles, that parental violations of consent can create in adolescents, makes you uncomfortable.\n\nHowever that doesn't change the fact that all the research points to children who grow up in homes where immediate family members consistently violate their boundaries, leading to lifelong inabilities to maintain healthy relationship boundaries, and often results in a pattern of choosing abusive relationships in adulthood. \n\nSo yes \"Boundaries, boundaries, boundaries, boundaries\". They are one of the most important, and fundamental cornerstones to not only building, but maintaining healthy relationships.
