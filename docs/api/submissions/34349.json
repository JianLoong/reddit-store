This isn\u2019t it and it\u2019s certainly not worth all the family drama your SIL is causing.

No one\u2019s family should treat them like this. The gossiping and FB put downs are vile. They are ganging up on you and picking on you. You and your husband need to put your feet down and not avoid it (as he has been doing). It should not be ignored. It\u2019s harmful and will escalate if not stopped. You have the option not to see any of them until they can treat you with respect. \nIt\u2019s your choice to dress your young boys as you wish. I\u2019d give them choices and options right now though, and really mean it. They may be trying to please you. Even Princes William and Harry cringed when they saw video of themselves dressed in matching outfits as little boys by Princess Diana, and said they hated it, and asked why she had done that. You need to find other outlets for your fashion interest and seamstress skills. Don\u2019t impose it on your boys. On special occasions, ok, but not for much longer in their lives and not very often. Still, your female relatives are handling this very poorly.", "Nta. How the kids feel about it is the only opinion that matters, and they don't care. I'd take them shopping, or just get input and let them help pick matching outfits they like (in any way. Like if all the more you can get them to care is to all agree what color theme the set should be, or that it has a tie, or a style of hat, or whatever amused them). They can't say you forced it if the kids helped pick it (even if it's just to tell you \"we want a red/blue/green set\" or \"we think x,y,z is cool\" before running off and doing kid stuff they actually care about). --- but generally, just ignore the haters. They obviously have nothing better to do but worry about outfits.... .... to have such a life. Lol --- seriously, enjoy it while it lasts. They'll develop opinions on it eventually, and you won't get to do it long. I only got 2 halloween's before my kid was having none of my ideas for costumes.

Your in-laws need to just pound sand, It\u2019s not hurting anyone and the fact that they are all butt-hurt about it is just really weird. It\u2019s just matching outfits for Christ sake.

Pretty sure they'll tell you the same.", "NTA\n\nTo add some perspective here: I live in Japan and this is *incredibly* common for young siblings, from coordinated outfits to straight up the same clothes in different sizes.

Especially when going out to do something special.\n\nMy friend and myself wore coordinated Christmas outfits to an event that was on the 24th and we got compliments on it, and I remember while there that there was a family of three who all wore tops from the same brand.

And I hate looking back at the stupid pictures now. My sister and I were 2 years apart and looked nothing alike. Why dress us alike? My sister and I both agree we don't like that she did that. So... yeah. Stop", "Kind of odd. I was offering both my children choices of what to wear at very young ages. They show individuality very early, do children.\n\nHow are you encouraging that as a parent?

If you can\u2019t accomplish that? I think you should talk to a therapist. \n\nSometimes when we feel like we lack control outside of our intimate family world, we exert too much within it.

It's not her place to be dictating anything about your kids, although I do think some of her criticisms are reasonable.\n\nThis does sound like you're forcing your interests onto your kids. I don't believe that 3 boys under 5 desperately want to be wearing matching outfits and whilst you say you'll stop if one of them doesn't want to anymore, I think you're underestimating how much of a challenge that might be for a young child. \n\nIt sounds like you've been through some difficult stuff recently and this hobby is helping you deal with it (if it were just you, I'd be all in favor of you having this therapeutic outlet). Your kids will have noticed that dressing them up makes mom happy and now that big bro sounds like he's showing interest in it too, that's a lot of pressure for a <4yo to go with the flow, even if they're not into it. Your younger kids won't want to make mom sad or say they don't want to wear what big bro picked out, so they may just supress their own wants just to avoid rocking the boat.\n\nI think you're also getting pretty close to the age where your oldest might start getting teased about it. I doubt other 5 year olds will care, but by age 7, kids will definitely start noticing and something like this could absolutely be picked up on as something to be made fun of. \n\nMaybe I'm completely wrong and your kids absolutely love doing this, but I'm inferring a slightly defensive tone to this OP that suggests to me that you might have some doubts. There's something about larger families in matching outfits that gives off a slightly weird, sheltered, religious-homeschooler type vibe and I know I wouldn't want to subject my kids to that.", "NTA they are YOUR kids and you\u2019re being very reasonable and perceptive. She\u2019s jealous and judgy", "I don't think you are the AH for making the kids wear matching clothes, that's not an issue, but for what you are saying, it seems is like a game for you, something to have fun with. This are your children, not your toys. YTA for that. If you are having personal issues, please, go to therapy or solve them in some other way but stop using your children as toys or for your own ammusement.", "NTA. I find it a tad obnoxious but if that's the worst you do to your kids, it's been a good day. There are far bigger problems in the world. \n\nYou would only be the asshole of they asked you to stop.", "So basically what I\u2019m getting from this is that your SIL and and some other family members are all dissing your existence as a parent just because you dress your kids in matching outfits, and no one else seems to have a problem with it because it generally isn\u2019t.\n\nWhat the absolute hell. NTA.", "NTA. They will let u know when to stop.   My kid had no interest in choosing, putting on or off any of his clothes.  Then one day my mom bought him a shirt with an elephant on it that made elephant noises when you pushed the bottom his his trunk. He took that shit off SOOOOOOOOOO fast.", ">NTA  \n>  \n>Until your kids can tell you \"I don't want to wear that\" or whatever, you have to pick out clothes for them. It's not hurting anyone, so your SIL can kick rocks.\n\nSeconding this. As long as they are okay with it, go for it!  Eventually they will push back and then you can help them express their individuality instead!", "Everything else aside, I\u2019m actually excited for them to start developing their own styles. My eldest helps me choose their clothes and accessories sometimes and I\u2019m seeing a pattern with his choices and it\u2019s such a nice feeling.", ">NTA. Do they have trauma with people who have matching outfits?\n\nProbably watched The Shining too many times.", "Zoot Suit Riot!", "They\u2019re less than five. Yeah, if she forces them to dress like that once they start school it could be an issue. But no toddler is going to walk up to another toddler and start teasing him because he matches his siblings.", "Bullied? Jesus Christ this subreddit is insane. What, a 5 year old is going to bully another 5 year old because when their mom picked them up their little brothers were dressed the same?!", "Well yes I am doing this for me, it brings me joy. I\u2019m not hurting anyone. If the kids don\u2019t like it and want me to stop, I\u2019ll stop. No biggie. And I doubt this\u2019ll continue by the time they start school, I expect them to have developed their own styles by then.", "I dont know...\n\nMy oldest son started to give his opinion on cloths when he was about 4 years old. He is now 6 and he likes to pick out his own.\nBefore that i would just grab whatever i liked and put it on him.\n\nMy 2 year old doesnt give a shit.", "I\u2019m with you. From a young age I\u2019ve let mine pick clothes, and once old enough that they  could, hair. \n\nI think it\u2019s a really good way to teach them that they are in charge of their bodies.  They need good options at the under 5 age. Like I\u2019d give options from weather appropriate wear, but beyond that go for it. Knowing they have some control over their body, helps when you start to teach about things like consent, and the right to say no. It\u2019s an extension of not having to give a hug or kiss to anyone if they don\u2019t want it. \n\nYes sometimes it meant Batman went grocery shopping with me, in grey shark raincoats, but who cares?", "If the kids objected, they would make that known. Isn't that the point? My daughter made it very clear around 2 that she was not wearing a dress. It was not long after that she expressed colour preference. My son didn't seem to care until he started school and started wanting brand names. Maybe her kids share part of her style.", "I have one daughter who really didn\u2019t care what clothes I put her in. And I have another daughter who had very strong clothing opinions by age 2 and had no trouble expressing them. They may not know the words for cashmere and cotton poly blend, but they know \u201cNO!!!\u201d and will definitely use it if you annoy them in any way.", "What disservice is OP doing? \n\nIt\u2019s doubtful all of her kids are infants. Toddlers are old enough to say \u201cno\u201d, and certainly old enough to throw a fit if they don\u2019t want a certain piece of clothing on their bodies. \n\nMost people have no clue what their parents dressed them in under 5 because it has zero impact on their lives.", "Oh no kids that young can definitely express their annoyance. My oldest is 8 and he still likes me to pick out his clothes, but he might go change something up if he wasn't feeling it. My middle is 6 and has his own style for years now. If I pick something out he doesn't like he will straight up tell me ew mom I don't want to wear this and go get something he loves. He's done that for over 2 years. My youngest is 4 and she is very opinionated and likes to pick out her own clothes for the most part. She does like to dress in similar things to my outfit at times and I love it and she loves it. Kids from a young age can definitely advocate for themselves. Oh and my 2 boys will still wear the same things together, even in elementary and they actually like it.", "Or one that says \"my mommy may be entitled, but at least she's not a - - - - - like my aunt\"", "Also (and not saying it is going to or is happening here) but it's very common that the person focused on the action doesn't listen to the physical and verbal requests to stop. They justify that their \"models\" in this case, don't really mean it and pull the \"but you're so pretty, don't you want to make mommy happy\" emotional heartstring tug because they're bot ready to stop so they justify the action they do and dismiss the requests of others to cease.", "I do all of this? They just don\u2019t really care (especially the younger ones) so I just dress them how I like -for now-. My eldest is pretty involved in the decision making too.", "You\u2019re making so many assumptions here", ">Your one kid has already said he doesn't like it. \n\n?? nope, lol. \n\nI agree this doesn't sound the healthiest but let's not invent things.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying but none of my kids have said they dislike it.", "let's not impose toxic masculinity standards on literal toddlers.", "I have a therapist I see regularly and I\u2019m on meds too. \n\nAnd yes I have! My eldest goes shopping with me and helps me pick out themes, etc. and I mean I could totally let the kids pick out their own clothes but they usually just stare at me. My eldest has only recently started to add his two cents.  \n\nAs for shopping addictions and the sort, I make a lot of the clothes/accessories! I buy a good amount I won\u2019t lie but a lot of them are also perfectly fine pieces of clothing family members were going to throw out.", "I\u2019m exaggerating a little. We don\u2019t dress up EVERY day. And it is a little expensive but I\u2019ve saved a lot by reusing clothes from other family members/making them myself. The money isn\u2019t a problem though.", "My mother was like you OP, the three of us wearing the same shitty stupid outfit because she felt so \"happy and excited all her children are the same\".\n\nWe all were young when we told her we would prefer other clothes, she didn't care and keep doing it until we were close to 13-10.\n\nI hated it, I can't even see those horrendous pictures of us wearing matching outfits.\n\nIf you're one of \"those moms\" who uses their children as dolls to dress NTA, you do you.", "Ask the oldest. You do need another hobby though. NTA atm.", "Did you discuss this with them? If not, you need to ASK.", "You think there\u2019s an equal power dynamic there where your kids feel like they can say no? Or are old enough to? Doing this for you is selfish. YTA", "My oldest really didn\u2019t care what she wore until she was 4 or older. In a lot of ways, she STILL doesn\u2019t care that much at 10. If I grab clothes for her, she\u2019s usually game to wear them. \n\nMy younger daughter, however, had very strong opinions about her clothes by the age of about 2. By 3, I could no longer talk my twins into coordinating Halloween costumes: she wanted to be Minnie Mouse and he wanted to be Spider-Man and neither one was budging. \n\nDifferent kids are different. And if the kids are happy with mom\u2019s outfit choices, that\u2019s fine. They will most definitely let her know if they aren\u2019t.", "No they would not, IF the parent has shown a marked repeated preference for one way of choosing. \n\nChildren are not ALL naturally decisive and \u201crebellious\u201d and independent. Some are submissive and anxiety prone and literally would never ever go against a parent\u2019s marked preferences or risk losing the positive reinforcement that right now is abundant when they wear what they are told to wear.", "when they're getting dressed, do you give them options to choose from? If not, start giving them options and if they all choose to wear the same outfit, you'll have your answer", "Your kids are too young to go against Mommy...", "Staring at you, could that be because they don\u2019t know how to choose for themselves? Or that they worry about NOT matching now that you have so clearly shown a preference for it?\n\nKids are always worried about making mistakes. When a parent shows them via approval or indulgence that a certain choice is \u201cright\u201d?? They can have a LOT of anxiety then going AGAINST that.\n\nThis is why we as parents have to be SO careful how we frame the idea of choice, of individuality and that we love and accept them NO MATTER WHAT. \n\nYou are now working AGAINST, what you have shown them\u2026that you, one of the most important person In their lives\u2026likes uniformity best.", "I'm sorry your mom ignored your telling her that you wanted different clothes, and I'm sorry she forced you into matchy outfits long after it was inappropriate, but that is not what OP is doing.\n\nShe literally just explained that she's looking forward to the kids being old enough to express individuality, that she will do something different as soon as one of the kids gives any indication they aren't happy, and that she's already getting the oldest to help choose outfits. She is not just like your mom.", "He doesn\u2019t mind, he likes helping me choose what to wear as well. I just asked him again to double check. And I don\u2019t see why? I like making clothes and accessories. It\u2019s not just for my kids, it\u2019s for me and my husband and my sisters and my niblings as well.", "Aa long as she has expressed to them that they are allowed to wear what they want without consequences and encourages them to show he what they like, then OP's foing all right. A parent showing a preference for a certain type of clothing is not automatically going to make even a shy kid not want to speak up-usually, some form of retaliation is used to make the kid feel unsafe about voicing their opinion. \n\nBased on her phrasing, it's hard to say if OP has previously stopped dressing her kids in clothes they dislike or if she just said she would if they ever did so. I also highly doubt she's *only* dressing her kids up in matching clothes every day; if she mixes up having them wear matching and non-matching clothes, then the kids would likely have some measure of confidence picking out what they want. She also says in comments that she lets her oldest pick out stuff he likes at the store, so it aounds like she is doing her job of encouraging them to express their likes.", "Ah, my mistake. I read \"the second one of them expresses discomfort\" as your second oldest one has expressed discomfort.\n\nBut it's still weird to dress them  alike. It's weird when people do it all the time with twins and triplets. It's extra weird when the kids aren't the same age and it's not a special occasion.", "How about letting them wear different things that you make, instead of a tiny boy band. Even the younger ones have interests, tap into that.that way your brand is expanded. Dressing alike is probably fun for them, but don't make it a schtick.", "Which we have no idea she has done. And there is nothing more powerful to a child than parental approval\u2026especially this young. \n\nI will respectfully disagree with you as to shy kids, anxious kids, or people pleasing kids\u2026having raised one to adulthood, and worked around elementary kids\u2026and viewed exactly how much weight they assign the opinions of other people, including their parents.\n\nWe get one side. Hers. Not the kids. So imma assume like most everyone else here she will paint herself in the most favorable light possible."]}
