This isn\u2019t it and it\u2019s certainly not worth all the family drama your SIL is causing.

No one\u2019s family should treat them like this. The gossiping and FB put downs are vile. They are ganging up on you and picking on you. You and your husband need to put your feet down and not avoid it (as he has been doing). It should not be ignored. It\u2019s harmful and will escalate if not stopped. You have the option not to see any of them until they can treat you with respect. \nIt\u2019s your choice to dress your young boys as you wish. I\u2019d give them choices and options right now though, and really mean it. They may be trying to please you. Even Princes William and Harry cringed when they saw video of themselves dressed in matching outfits as little boys by Princess Diana, and said they hated it, and asked why she had done that. You need to find other outlets for your fashion interest and seamstress skills. Don\u2019t impose it on your boys. On special occasions, ok, but not for much longer in their lives and not very often. Still, your female relatives are handling this very poorly.", "Nta. How the kids feel about it is the only opinion that matters, and they don't care. I'd take them shopping, or just get input and let them help pick matching outfits they like (in any way. Like if all the more you can get them to care is to all agree what color theme the set should be, or that it has a tie, or a style of hat, or whatever amused them). They can't say you forced it if the kids helped pick it (even if it's just to tell you \"we want a red/blue/green set\" or \"we think x,y,z is cool\" before running off and doing kid stuff they actually care about). --- but generally, just ignore the haters. They obviously have nothing better to do but worry about outfits.... .... to have such a life. Lol --- seriously, enjoy it while it lasts. They'll develop opinions on it eventually, and you won't get to do it long. I only got 2 halloween's before my kid was having none of my ideas for costumes.

Your in-laws need to just pound sand, It\u2019s not hurting anyone and the fact that they are all butt-hurt about it is just really weird. It\u2019s just matching outfits for Christ sake.

Pretty sure they'll tell you the same.", "NTA\n\nTo add some perspective here: I live in Japan and this is *incredibly* common for young siblings, from coordinated outfits to straight up the same clothes in different sizes.

Especially when going out to do something special.\n\nMy friend and myself wore coordinated Christmas outfits to an event that was on the 24th and we got compliments on it, and I remember while there that there was a family of three who all wore tops from the same brand.

And I hate looking back at the stupid pictures now. My sister and I were 2 years apart and looked nothing alike. Why dress us alike? My sister and I both agree we don't like that she did that. So... yeah. Stop", "Kind of odd. I was offering both my children choices of what to wear at very young ages. They show individuality very early, do children.\n\nHow are you encouraging that as a parent?

If you can\u2019t accomplish that? I think you should talk to a therapist. \n\nSometimes when we feel like we lack control outside of our intimate family world, we exert too much within it.

Your kids will have noticed that dressing them up makes mom happy and now that big bro sounds like he's showing interest in it too, that's a lot of pressure for a <4yo to go with the flow, even if they're not into it. Your younger kids won't want to make mom sad or say they don't want to wear what big bro picked out, so they may just supress their own wants just to avoid rocking the boat.\n\nI think you're also getting pretty close to the age where your oldest might start getting teased about it.

Keep in mind that her kids aren\u2019t you and your sister. The way yall felt about something isn\u2019t gonna be how her kids feel because different people feel different things. Your mom created an environment where you felt you weren\u2019t allowed to express discomfort about being unable to express yourself. That\u2019s a completely different situation.", "By 4 or 5 I was very opinionated about what I wore. They will speak out when they don't want to wear it. Simple.", "INFO: If the oldest can express an opinion like that, have you **asked them** whether or not they want to dress the same as their kids? You absolutely should. YWBTA if you're not proactive about checking in on that.", "I feel like she's the mom who won't hear or acknowledge complaints because she doesn't think they're serious", "I have a set of twins who are a little older than the age of the girls in The Shining (but they are very petite, so they look younger than they are). One of them wants to dress as \u201cThe Come Play With Us\u201d twins (they\u2019re too young to see the movie IMO), but her twin has noped right out of that. So no matching Shining Twins Halloween costume\u2026\n\n(They have the right length hair, right color\u2026 but it\u2019s a 2 yes/1 no situation).", "I was put into an orange and green floral tiny 60s suit at 2 and am told my response was \"Take this icky thing offa me\"", "Grocery shopping with Batman - what an honour!", "\u201cSomething\u201d happened at work and they left their job. She doesn\u2019t go out so her sons and husband became her models. That\u2019s an unhealthy coping mechanism.", "Lol it starts before that \ud83d\ude02 I match my daughter as much as I can. She's 2.5. A few weeks ago I set out matching outfits for us and she walked in, saw the shirt and said \"Just ..... No\" literally walked back to her closet, grabbed another shirt and said \"Try this, ok?\" \n\nJust RUDE for NO REASON! \n\nOp, if your kids aren't complaining, you're fine! Match as long as you can!\n\nNta", "Also, when you\u2019re then the youngest and have to keep wearing the same outfit over and over, because you fit into the next hand me down size\u2026terrible.", "Based on what?", "Yeah, my mom used to dress me and my sister the same for holidays and special events and people would get on her for forcing that on us, so one year she got us different outfits. Apparently I threw a fit because I wanted to match my sister.", "No. That\u2019s the reality of a lot of mothers with multiple children under the age of 5. Daycare costs an arm, a leg, and a piece of your ass nowadays so most of her outside dalliances pretty much have to include her children. She said it\u2019s difficult to go out, not that she doesn\u2019t go out. It\u2019s fun for her. Let her have fun and enjoy her children as children before they grow up and enter the \u201cI hate my parents\u201d phase. As far as we know, they\u2019re cool with it. She\u2019s not forcing them and her oldest also thinks that it\u2019s fun. People have so little nowadays. Let them do what makes them happy if it\u2019s not harming anyone.", "Lmao its humbling a baby who needs help with everything telling you,  that you made a bad fashion choice \ud83e\udd23", "She didn't just ignored me but my older siblings too (I'm the youngest) and she use to say the exact same things OP is saying in the post but as I said, she's NTA and can keep \"having fun\" since those are OP kids", "As a kid, I had blonde hair and my sister had brown. I always got blonde baby dolls and she always got brunettes. One year Santa thought we might like having some variety and gave me the brunette and her the blonde. We came out Christmas morning and instantly said, \u201cSanta made a mistake\u201d and switched back. \ud83d\ude02", ">I will respectfully disagree with you as to shy kids, anxious kids, or people pleasing kids\u2026having raised one to adulthood, and worked around elementary kids\u2026and viewed exactly how much weight they assign the opinions of other people, including their parents.\n\nNot all shy kids are the same, though. I was a shy kid and as soon as I started forming an opinion on clothes, I had no trouble telling my mom about my opinions. Every child is going to be different, but the important thing is to be as supportive and encouraging as possible. The only true wrong way is for parents to be abusive and show their kids that their opinions don't matter. Going by what OP says, which is all we have, it sounds like she's not doing that at all. \n\n>We get one side. Hers. Not the kids. So imma assume like most everyone else here she will paint herself in the most favorable light possible.\n\nThat'a true, but at the same time, we have nothing else to go on. If we assume she's straight up lying, there's essentially no point even commenting on this post."]}
