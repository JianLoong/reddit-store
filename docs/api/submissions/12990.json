Firstly, they have a story to get into your house, or a story to get you outside your house, while someone nips in behind you and steals your stuff. Before the internet age and mobile homes it was something like, 'my daughter's beloved bunny rabbit got out of the garden whilst she was cleaning out the hutch and we chased it and it went round the back into your garden'. The other one is, they have run out of petrol, or they have had an accident and need to come in to use your home phone. One I fell for was, a ten year old girl saying she was a neighbour and she was home from school with a sprained ankle. Their toilet was blocked and the plumber was there seeing to it, but please could she use mine? I had no idea she was already a well accomplished thief and con artist. Scammers go round trying doors, then if unlocked, send the kid, or woman in and if caught claiming they thought it was their friend's house.  One of the tells of a scammer is changes in tone. Charming to wheedling, to threatening back to charm and wheedling again. Change in story. Every time you come up with an objection, or reason as to why you cannot fulfil their request, they change the story to something else. Your visitor was determined to gain entry, made threats to call the police if you didn't let them in and changed their story. You are far better being safe than sorry.", "NTA.

Of course, mama wouldn't have had to tell them to \"go grab their gun\" because mama would've been carrying too.", "I thought the same thing lol. Instantly escalates to \"Grab the gun!\". Even if it was a scammer, would you really want to drive him off at gunpoint? I'm Canadian and it's mind boggling to me.", "How old is this guy grabbing the gun? Living at home made me think teenager which is scary af. But I guess he could be an adult. Only slightly less scary that the first thing was lets get a deadly weapon.", "They\u2019re a little crazy for opening the door after dark when they aren\u2019t expecting anyone!", ">I wouldn\u2019t have even opened the door, honestly. \n\nTrue. I\u2019ve heard stories that what people do is use you opening the door to burst through it. Always gotta be careful", "The gym would definitely be hearing and getting some legal ramifications from me. Even if she came to them saying you did it they wouldn't show her video let alone give her your number. That puts them at more liability. After seeing the video the fact that the gym kept going with it. Nah since we want to waste time let's get it. I would have waited till she called the police then filed your report. Hers would be classified as a false report. Find a new gym .", "I wouldn't even have responded to the doorbell ringing and some rando standing there talking about his fictional wallet.", "I'd assume it's more a really pissed off guy who legit thinks someone there stole the wallet. So yeah, thats a potential powder keg. Best to have the police calm him down.", "The fact that the man knew OP went to Kroger could mean that he might\u2019ve been stalking OP and was hoping to kidnap them.\n\nHe might\u2019ve changed his mind as soon as he heard OP\u2019s mom. He probably thought OP was home alone and was trying to trick them into saying \u201cOh I\u2019m home alone and mom/everyone is working right now\u201d but that backfired as OP called the police.\n\nOr maybe it is some weird scam. I don\u2019t know but this is a very weird- and maybe a bit terrifying- situation. NTA.", "Not so much a scam, but possibly an \"excuse\" to get inside the house for some reason.", "Try home invasion since his son was right there.\n\nNTA", "Bad bot. This comment is stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zjsu3/comment/jdcndeu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).", "Bot", "That actually makes a lot of sense.\n\nThis is why I have anxiety about answering the door, 50% of the time it\u2019s my neighbors for an actually good reason though so I always feel like I should even though I know I\u2019m not obligated too.", "Yep. Especially because he says the son has it and the GPS shows it as being in the street. It was definitely just in his pocket or his car lol", "I totally thought the device was in his pocket.", "Yeah minutes away and unable to do shit when you only have seconds.....", "At close quarters, guns are useless anyway. Ever hear of the \"20-ft rule\"?\n\nIf you're standing 2 feet away from someone on your porch and they decide to have a go at you, you don't have time to draw and fire anyway. \n\nAnd once they know you have a gun, it immediately escalates a potentially violent encounter to life-or-death stakes.", "That sounds like a generally horrid way to live. What about community building?", "I conceal carry, which is legal in my state w/o a permit.  Someone breaking into my house wouldn't end well for the bad guy.", "Yes, here in the US scammers and criminals will shoot you in a second.", "OP could be 16-17 so they asked about mom. Definitely shouldn't have confirmed that she was there though.  I don't trust people enough unless they tell me who they are (business usually.) Many years ago i was left alone and i opened the door to a lawyer. Didn't know it, i was 12, and they told me to give that packet to my mom (stepmother) and he left. I was lucky nothing bad happened beyond some person suing my stepmother and her being served. 23 year old me looks back and sighs at 12 year old me xD", "So here's the thing - we were there because my husband was called in for a job interview as a massage therapist - we weren't even members there.\n\nSo they gave the lady our info off his resume and job application - I was wondering if we even had any legal right as far as that was concerned.\n\nEdited to add - he was hired - but a few days later.", "[removed]", "Same for me in Canada. Unless it's a farmer most people don't have guns at the ready. So we keep a big knife or a baseball bat on hand to be safe because it could take actual hours for the cops to show up even if your only 20 mins away from the station.", "Racist much?", "Yes, like let them take your shit who cares. Insurance to replace the financial losses is better than weapons to escalate a situation. \n\nIn this case the person isn\u2019t even inside your house yet but is trying to talk their way in so shut the door, lock it , and tell them you\u2019re happy to continue discussing it when the police arrive", "We have GPS on my husband's car and it can be spot on accurate or utterly ridiculous in where it says the car is. For awhile when it was parked in our own driveway where we could see it, the app said the car was 2 miles down the road in the pond.", "Bot", "My dad lives in Northern Ontario and they closed the OPP detachment in his town a couple years ago. So if police are needed, they're a minimum of 45 minutes away (in good weather, if there hasn't been an accident on the only highway into town). He's 70 and the town has had tons of issues with addicts breaking in to houses looking for anything they can steal, so I hate the thought of him living there alone.", "They're not being racist, they're saying cops are racist.", "How is that racist?", "Did you know that 64% of statistics are made up on the spot?", "Who answers their door for a stranger at 8PM?", "You're taking your chances that they are just going to steal.", "Hold on. A home invasion and a burglary are two very different things. One is a violent crime, the other is a property crime. Violent crimes justify violent responses.", "Why don't you post what you think is relevant to your point?  What's that?  People have to just believe you and go on fruitless searches for things that have no connection to your point?  Of course...", "That's a huge difference in our cultures I guess. If someone rangs at my door in the middle of the night with that type of story, I very politly say : wait a minute, I'll be right there. Then I'll call the cops and go back to bed. Not my problem, don't care about the wallet and I'm definitely not going to open the door, with or without a gun. He's a freaking stranger!", "All the people I know drink water and they still live. So my own research proves that drinking water makes you immortal.", "Generally that IS what strangers want when they break into your home. Usually they were hoping you wouldn\u2019t be there, much easier to steal when nobody is around\n\nAs a woman I know I\u2019m much more likely to be seriously assaulted or murdered by a current or former partner than a stranger breaking into my house to steal shit or just bc he feels like murdering me, so I don\u2019t really worry about home invasions. And since the greatest danger for most women is their partners, a gun in the home can really escalate things and make that much more dangerous. I also have children, and for teenagers a gun in the home makes it much more likely that suicidal ideation will be acted upon successfully\u2014everybody goes through shit, the teenage years are hard and we all have our moments, but immediate access to guns raises the likelihood of suicide substantially \n\nI\u2019ve made the calculation that overall guns are not going to keep me and my family safe", "Nah it\u2019s called fuck around and find out. Come in my place uninvited I\u2019m not gonna wait and find out if you\u2019re violent", "That\u2019s fair, I wouldn\u2019t actually open the door.  But I\u2019m also not going to the door to ask what\u2019s up without a gun.  Doors are incredibly easy to kick in, they\u2019re more psychologic protection than any real deterrent to someone who wants to do you harm.", "I'm the same, I have a handgun hidden in almost every room in my house.  Break in?  You'll be carried out.", "Assuming you don\u2019t live in the US: currently, there are areas where trans people are not free to exist in public unless they have not physically transitioned. Several states either have banned or are considering banning transition care. Teachers in Florida can be punished for even mentioning gay people or other gender/sexual minorities. I used to volunteer for a queer youth suicide hotline until about 2 weeks ago and not only were we getting an insane influx of scared queer youth, we also have been getting a wild increase in trolling from people trying to block up the platform. \n\nBlack people cant really walk freely on dark streets at night some places without fear of cops. Even doing literally nothing wrong, they\u2019ve been shot or beaten to death (and even if they were breaking the law, the answer to that is absolutely not to allow cops to kill them) \n\nPregnant people aren\u2019t free to access quality abortion or even just more common pregnancy care. A lot of Americans can\u2019t access quality medical care in general. \n\nShit is bad here at the moment.", "Good for you. I hope it continues that way for you. I really do.", "I am not both (but people have assumed I am a hispanic) and I feel free too.\n\nI had an interaction with an officer a few years ago when I was a witness in a hit and run. The officer found out I had a CCW permit and did not have my weapon with me at the time he chastised me for not carrying it all the always.", "Rather be judged by 12 than carried by 6", "Or be disarmed. Not my problem", "All the more reason to have one. If the government says you shouldn't have something, get 2.", "So, what rights have been taken by law?", "the uh\u2026 the ones where you\u2019re allowed to mention gay people existing bc that\u2019s free speech. Or the ones that protect gender minorities. or the ones where people aren\u2019t allowed to murder other people. take your pick really \n\nalso pretending that only codified law infringes on people\u2019s rights is pedantic and silly. real people are being actually threatened in real time"]}
