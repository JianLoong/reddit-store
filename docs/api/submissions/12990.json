I check to see who it is and a man is standing outside with his phone. I tell them to wait a minute to put on my coat before stepping out. The man then proceeded to ask me if I had found a wallet at the nearby Kroger. I actually was at kroger in the morning but didn't find any wallets so I was confused and replied no. He then goes to show me his phone and says his wallet has GPS tracking which shows my house specifically but when I look at the screen it shows being in the middle of the street and explain there's no way for his wallet to be at my house. He then asks me to ask my mom if maybe she has the wallet. I step inside and ask my mom and she says she hasn't left the house all day. She tells me it might be a scammer and to grab my gun just incase. I step back outside and tell him I have no idea where his wallet is and he threatens me saying his going to get the police involved. His tone is very condescending so I decide to call the police to get a head start on the situation. The dispatch asks for the story and while I explain, he decides to call his son and \"magically\" the son has the wallet and he says he's going to just leave. I say the police are already on the way and he probably shouldn't leave, and he decides to also call the police. The police arrive a couple minutes later and he's trying to explain the GPS shows my house and the police tell him it's very inaccurate. (I'm thinking, how does the GPS show my house if his son has it) \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  a few minutes later the man is asked to leave the premises. \n\nI'd like to know AITA in this situation?

Okay, you got the police there.  Its all good.", "NTA.  This absolutely sounds like a scam and you did the right thing calling the police.  First, GPS is often wrong and most people know this.  Second, anyone \"stealing\" a wallet will likely clean it out of anything valuable and trash it as they won't want anything like GPS or identifiable on them to trace it to them.. And third, most people if they \"find\" a wallet in a store, would leave it with the store.  If this guy was serious, he should have involved the police to begin with if he thought it was stolen.    You calling the police put it on their radar and they have a report of this guy, hopefully with his id in it in case he tries to do this again.", "NTA.

The changes in his story is concerning.", "NTA", "NTA Honestly, you should have never opened the door. There was no missing wallet.  It's great you have protection in your home, however, opening the door to a stranger is an escalation of the situation.  There is no law that reads you must always answer your door.  You were very lucky he didn't jump right when you opened it. He might not have be alone when he knocked. His\"son\" may have been to the side, or in the back.

In fact something similar happened to us a couple of years ago with some drunk guy pounding on our door at 4:30 in the morning.  We answered the door without opening, spoke to the guy through the door, and he said his girlfriend left her phone at our house.  Not having any idea what he was referring to, we ended up calling the police, but he was gone before they got there.\n\nTurns out, neighbor who drives for Uber picked up his (also drunk) girlfriend earlier and she left her cell phone in his car.
