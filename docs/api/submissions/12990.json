I check to see who it is and a man is standing outside with his phone. I tell them to wait a minute to put on my coat before stepping out. The man then proceeded to ask me if I had found a wallet at the nearby Kroger. I actually was at kroger in the morning but didn't find any wallets so I was confused and replied no. He then goes to show me his phone and says his wallet has GPS tracking which shows my house specifically but when I look at the screen it shows being in the middle of the street and explain there's no way for his wallet to be at my house. He then asks me to ask my mom if maybe she has the wallet. I step inside and ask my mom and she says she hasn't left the house all day. She tells me it might be a scammer and to grab my gun just incase. I step back outside and tell him I have no idea where his wallet is and he threatens me saying his going to get the police involved. His tone is very condescending so I decide to call the police to get a head start on the situation. The dispatch asks for the story and while I explain, he decides to call his son and \"magically\" the son has the wallet and he says he's going to just leave. I say the police are already on the way and he probably shouldn't leave, and he decides to also call the police. The police arrive a couple minutes later and he's trying to explain the GPS shows my house and the police tell him it's very inaccurate. (I'm thinking, how does the GPS show my house if his son has it) \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  a few minutes later the man is asked to leave the premises. \n\nI'd like to know AITA in this situation? I feel like once he said he's going to get the police involved he shouldn't have tried to intimidate and just called them immediately.

Okay, you got the police there.  Its all good.", "NTA.  This absolutely sounds like a scam and you did the right thing calling the police.  First, GPS is often wrong and most people know this.  Second, anyone \"stealing\" a wallet will likely clean it out of anything valuable and trash it as they won't want anything like GPS or identifiable on them to trace it to them.. And third, most people if they \"find\" a wallet in a store, would leave it with the store.  If this guy was serious, he should have involved the police to begin with if he thought it was stolen.    You calling the police put it on their radar and they have a report of this guy, hopefully with his id in it in case he tries to do this again.", "NTA. If I tracked my wallet to someones house, I would call the police before going to the door. That is weird, but I don't know how that could be turned into a scam...", "NTA\u2026next time for your own safety do not go outside and engage them.   Some of these scammers can be dangerous.  You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, in fact I prob would have called the cops when  he told you to ask your mom about the wallet.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYou 100% did the right thing to call the police.", "NTA\n\nThe post got too American for me when you mentioned \u201cgrabbing the gun, just in case\u201d \nLmao", "NTA. He expressed wanting the police involved. You got the police involved.\n\nGPS can be pretty inaccurate sometimes. He may have been close but just had the wrong house on the block. He doesn't sound particularly bright so he may not have fully grasped that he had the wrong house and just thought you were lying to him, thus his persistence.\n\nSorry you had to deal with such a weird situation.", "Absofuckinglutely NOT the asshole. Dude was in the wrong. He was making you feel uncomfortable. You did the right thing.", "NTA, and hopefully you just prevented him from a scamming others in the future.\n\nWell done for protecting others!", "NTA\nYou did the right thing calling the police for a stranger on your porch asking questions and making accusations", "Tf? NTA you prevented a scammer and they got mad that they have to go get a real job.", "Your first mistake was opening the door at all. The entire situation was indeed freaky and you were correct to call the police. Sounds like a scam to get into your house or case it and there never was a wallet.

I can't think of any where the cops having his details could be regarded as a bad thing. \n\nYou acted reasonably and sensibly, though the question Why would anyone would live in a place where grabbing a firearm 'just in case' is normal? does confuse most of the planet. \n\nBefore you (or anyone else) makes the obvious rejoinder: I am an American who emigrated to Europe. The NRA was about number 4 in my list of reasons to move. We are every bit as free as you are. No it wasn't a bunch Daniel Boone types with AR15s who defeated the Nazis - it was government employees with serious heavy weaponry and most of them were Russian.\n\nDownvotes, anyone? :)", "NTA but never even open a door for a stranger.
