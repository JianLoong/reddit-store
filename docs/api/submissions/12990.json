Firstly, they have a story to get into your house, or a story to get you outside your house, while someone nips in behind you and steals your stuff. Before the internet age and mobile homes it was something like, 'my daughter's beloved bunny rabbit got out of the garden whilst she was cleaning out the hutch and we chased it and it went round the back into your garden'. The other one is, they have run out of petrol, or they have had an accident and need to come in to use your home phone. One I fell for was, a ten year old girl saying she was a neighbour and she was home from school with a sprained ankle. Their toilet was blocked and the plumber was there seeing to it, but please could she use mine? I had no idea she was already a well accomplished thief and con artist. Scammers go round trying doors, then if unlocked, send the kid, or woman in and if caught claiming they thought it was their friend's house.  One of the tells of a scammer is changes in tone. Charming to wheedling, to threatening back to charm and wheedling again. Change in story. Every time you come up with an objection, or reason as to why you cannot fulfil their request, they change the story to something else. Your visitor was determined to gain entry, made threats to call the police if you didn't let them in and changed their story. You are far better being safe than sorry.", "NTA.

Be on the watch out tonight!", "If it's a scam, start your thinking with the assumption that there never was a lost wallet, because scams almost never are based on an event that actually happen. They are scams, not taking advantage of a real event.\n\nOnce you establish that, how might someone leverage a lost item with a gps as a scam?\n\nThere are many cheap gps trackers available online, as small as a bottle cap. They can be attached to anything. Its intent is to track lost items, but it's still a tracking device. \n\nA person with nefarious intent can take a gps tracker and place it wherever they want. They can attach it to a car, for example. In fact this is something Apple warns about with apple tags. The person attaches the tag to a car, or slips it into a purse or bag of food in the groceries (or just simply follows OP to their home from the store). They now know where a person lives.\n\nOnce there, they make up a story about a lost wallet and a gps tracker that brought them to OP's house. They can even 'prove it' by showing OP their tracking app. From here they have multiple possibilities to take advantage of OP: they may case the house by looking around inside. They get an idea of how many people live there and what security they see. They identify anything easy and valuable to burgle. Or maybe they run with the lost wallet angle. They insist OP stole the wallet with the GPS tag as their evidence, and they blackmail the OP saying \"I had XYZ of $,$$$ value in there and I can prove it. I have all the evidence as you can clearly see. I'm going to go to the police if you don't pay me $500 right now to just take the loss and not report you.\" \n\nBack to the OP's story, this story smells 1000% like either a scam or a burglar casing the house.

This person was already demonstrating a stance of coersion and threat over this wallet situation.

Its results support many other studies. I\u2019m an epidemiologist, so I\u2019ll try to explain some of your concerns with the design.\n\n>\tThat case is, exclusively localized to Pennsylvania\n\nWell this is a [case-control stud](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/ep/ep713_case-control/ep713_case-control_print.html)y, often used for investigation of uncommon conditions/situations, so it\u2019s common to select from a single target population (in this case, adults in Philadelphia) to maximize comparability between cases and controls.\n\nFor studies among other populations, see here:\n[Gun ownership as a risk factor for homicide in the home](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8371731/)\n\n[A cohort study](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M21-3762)\n\nAnd this [collection](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-threats-and-self-defense-gun-use-2/) of high-quality studies from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center.\n\n>\tis taking into account assault at any time of day, at any place\n\nIn studies like this, it can be more informative to start with a wider group of cases/controls and then create subgroups to investigate more specific situations. That way you aren\u2019t throwing away information from the start.\n\nThe investigators provide a rationale for their approach:\n\u201cWe assumed that the resident population of Philadelphia risked being shot in an assault at any location and at any time of day or night\u2026Any member of the general population has the potential to be exposed to guns and the bullets they discharge regardless of where they are or what they are doing. As such, we reasonably chose not to exclude participants as immune from hypothetically becoming cases because they were, for instance, asleep at home during the night or at work in an office building during the day. **Instead we measured and controlled for time-based situational characteristics that might have changed, but did not eliminate, the possibility of being shot in an assault**.\u201d\n\n>\tIn the case where you have a gun at ready in your home in a defensive position, the odds would be drastically shifted towards the favor of the gun owner.\n\nThis was actually one of the main purposes of the study, to explore gun injuries in general and then also see if this was different based on time-based situational characteristics. However, the findings do not support your claim:\n\u201c**Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance to resist, this adjusted odds ratio increased to 5.45 (P < .05)**\u201d \n\n\n\n*Chance to resist* was based on \u201ccircumstance data and written accounts from police, paramedics, and medical examiners\u2026Case participants with at least some chance to resist were in contrast to those that happened very suddenly, involved substantial distances, had no face-to-face contact, and had physical barriers between victim and shooter (e.g., an otherwise uninvolved victim shot in his living room from a gun fired during a fight down the street).\u201d\n\n>\tThey also for whatever reason excluded all results from people who were not either White or Black\n\nAgain, addressed by study designers:\n\n\u201cWe excluded\u2026individuals not described as Black or White as they were involved in a very small percentage of shootings (< 2%).\u201d By excluding this small number of cases, they made control selection easier.", "but then the cops have reasonable suspicion to shoot you", ">This isn\u2019t actually a weird source, it\u2019s a very robust case-control study in a leading public health journal.\n\nNo, it's definitely still a weird source to use in this situation.\n\n>Well this is a case-control study\n\nI know what a case control study is you condescending jackass lmao, and I'm not exactly sure what your intention is when I determined the study was weird after reading it and all you did was just repeat lines from the text that I had already read and determined as weird, but if you must know why I think that.\n\nFor starters the conversation was about specifically about **home invasion from an unknown party where the homeowner had a gun**, so linking a study primarily taken from data and situations that happened in public already has very little place in the topic.\n\n>Gun ownership as a risk factor for homicide in the home\n\nThis source is about Mental Illness and Drug Use relating to in house homicides, which is not relevant when home invasion is what was being talked about.\n\n>A cohort study\n\nIn the same vein as why the Pennsylvania example is weird, this study is taken in California, both states that are [around the bottom 10](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/gun-ownership-by-state) in gun ownership, making deterrence far less of a factor in these states.  Not only that, but the study itself states that most were not from home invasion.\n\n>\"Among homicides occurring at home, cohabitants of owners had sevenfold higher rates of being fatally shot by a spouse or intimate partner\"\n\nWhich again ties into being irrelevant for the discussion of home invasion, because shooting someone that lives with you isn't a home invasion.\n\n>collection\n\nThe collection says very little relevant to the home invasion topic apart from what the second topic you linked did, which is that they are more often used for in household crimes rather than to defend from home invasions, which may be true, but the discussion was about defending from home invasions, not what the guns are used for.\n\n>Instead we measured and controlled for time-based situational characteristics that might have changed, but did not eliminate, the possibility of being shot in an assault\n\nAgain, weird to use a source like this in a discussion about defending from home invasions when the entire point of the study is being assaulted, which usually takes place outside of the home, home invasions are more often categorized as burglaries.  Not to mention the phrase \"might have changed\" in a case study is just conjecture.\n\n>This was actually one of the main purposes of the study, to explore gun injuries in general and then also see if this was different based on time-based situational characteristics Among gun assaults where the victim had at least some chance to resist, this adjusted odds ratio increased to 5.45 (P < .05)\n\nIt actually is completely irrelevant to my claim, because once again, these are not statistics for home invasions.  \"Chance to resist in public\" is not the same as \"Being in your own home against an invader\".  Even if it \\*does\\* include that, the numbers would be drastically skewed because these are only using situations in which the gun owner failed to defend themselves and shootings are more common in public areas than the house, nothing in the article relates to successful defense, it's all based on survival odds.\n\n>\u201cWe excluded\u2026individuals not described as Black or White as they were involved in a very small percentage of shootings (< 2%).\u201d By excluding this small number of cases, they made control selection easier.\n\nWhen the data is race irrelevant, it is very weird to pick and choose what to exclude based on race.
