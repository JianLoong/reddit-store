Let alone take on the responsibility without even being asked", "As far the general situation, NTA You are also not an impressive human being. Your wife is in the middle of a family crisis and you sound like you've been petulant as fuck.", "NTA\n\nYou both agreed on not being parents. It's one thing to take him in for a while. It's quite another to take him in permanently. The big part here is her not even discussing it with you. That's a big deal! This is a subject that needs to be discussed at length. At a point and time where neither person is angry. \n\nYou need to express that this is not specifically about her brother, more so about you not wanting to be a father. That the needs he requires are more than you can handle. He needs to know that you don't hate him or dislike him, just that this is a lot to handle for someone that's never been a parent and it's too much for you. \n\nHopefully there's someone else in the family that can take him in.", "ESH\n\nYour wife shouldn't be putting this much care taking on you. If neither of you want kids especially, but its her little brother not yours.\n\nYou suck for not having empathy for your wife's family and being so resentful you're letting it spill all over your face and adding more BS to this poor kids plate.

Advocate for your needs without making this poor kid feel awful.", "NTA\n\nOther than not sleeping in your bed.\n\nI think you probably have two choices.\n\n    1. Suck it up and deal with it to keep the wife happy. (I       wouldn't advise this, you will just resent them both).\n\n    2.

He can sleep on the couch until we move all the stuff we put in the spare room. \n\nAs someone who has had a parallel experience to your wife, I suggest you don\u2019t put yourself in a situation where she feels like she has to choose between you.

The kid is 15 so more than likely he\u2019ll be with you for another 2-3 years. Also it\u2019s kind of telling that you\u2019re so upset about not having alcohol in the house. Your post comes across as very selfish. I understand the not having kids, I\u2019m child free by choice, but a 15 year old typically is very independent and self sufficient. He\u2019ll be eligible for his drivers license soon so you won\u2019t even have to drive him to AA.", "YTA. Would you help a friend in the same situation? He doesn't need a parent he needs a sister/friend. Acting cold and rude to him isn't going to help matters and kicking him out after his parents already did so is doubly harsh. What if no other family is safe for him? You might find that acting this callously to her brother will make your wife rethink your relationship. She isn't asking you to be his dad.", "NAH. You and your wife should have discussed this before hand or at least within a few days of Lucas coming. You have a right to not want to play dad, but at the age of 15 you can offer shelter and access to resources like AA without any parental obligations. Sort this out ASAP.", "NTA.

You will lose your wife over this.", "YTA, and a bit of delusional thinking on both yours and your wifes part.\n\nDid she actually \"rope you in\"? You're an adult with your own free will. Did she go get him without talking to you? Did she move him in and surprise you? Did she specifically say it was just for a couple days while she made other arrangments? Did she know he was an alcoholic and hide it from you? It sounds like you and her pretty much had the same information and made decisions together, and now that these consequences are coming to fruition and it's naturally settling into a permanent situation, you're blaming her for it while not talking to her about it at all.\n\nIt also sounds like you haven't communicated this with her. You even say you try to hide it. You haven't been honest or forthcoming with your boundaries but are resenting it anyways. Yeah, you agreed on no kids at some point, but unless you brought up these boundaries again and established what should happen when it comes to family, I don't think she's wrong for not knowing you wouldn't be ok wih her 15 year old brother. She might not have discussed permanency with you, but you didn't discuss it with her either, and you should have.\n\nYou're not TA for not wanting to play dad to a troubled teen, just TA for not communicating that, hiding it for long enough that the teen picked up on it, blaming your wife for it, and putting her in the really awkard spot of now having to either break up with you and get divorced, or kick out her already traumatized and struggling brother.", "Yta. Your wife never signed up to be a mom either, she's being a big sister to her little brother who is in need. He's 15, he can take care of himself for the most part, he just needs someone to drive him to places he needs to go and to support him. You don't have to be a dad, just an encouraging brother-in-law. If you quit being so stuck-up about it, maybe you'll actually bond with him and can enjoy hanging out with him, especially as he gets older. You get to skip all the tedious highly involved parts of being a patent to a young child and can benefit from an improved bond with your brother-in-law, who is only ten years younger than you might I add, and may someday be a really good friend if you support him now.", "YTA. You may not have signed up to be a dad, but your lack of empathy for your wife\u2019s brother is appalling. Poor kid is clearly going through a terrible time, his sister, YOUR WIFE, loves and wants to help her brother. For you to act like a spoiled, selfish brat says a lot about your character, none of it good. Shape up or she may take her brother and ship out. \nMy dad didn\u2019t sign up to take in my mom\u2019s 11 year old brother, but he did bc someone needed to when he was orphaned. Not only that, he went to court and fought for him to keep him from an abusive relative who was trying to take him. Be like my dad, who did the right thing not bc he wanted to, but bc he wasn\u2019t a complete ahole.", "I don't think you're an arsehole for not wanting to be a dad to a teenager with some issues.\n\nYTA for making it clear to him, though. \ud83d\ude15\n\nBut... you're aware that this might be a dealbreaker for your marriage, right? It's cool if you want to take this stand, but your wife might pick her brother and not you.", "Nah\n\nYou set a firm boundary when you got married, you sounded like you left no wiggle room (which is your right), and you haven't ever given a hint you changed your mind. \n\nShe wants to help her family through a tough time. Should she have discussed it with you, definitely, but her brother needed help and she chose to help him. \n\nThis is unfortunately a time where either one of you compromises, or you both get a divorce. I'd say it would be better if you did. He should be out in 3 years, at 15 he should be fairly independent around the house, and it shows your wife that you do care about her and her family. Think of him more as a roommate than a child. \n\nIf you try to force her to compromise, it shows that you don't care about her family (and possibly her by extension), and more likely than not *will* lead to divorce.", "NAH - your feelings are valid & so are hers\n\nIf you stay in this relationship, this will happen again. \n\nYou need to decide if you want to keep going with this relationship, because you can't have this reaction every time and think it's going to be okay.", "I am going NAH. You are in a tough situation. Let me be clear, though, you handled this horribly. Just not in a way I can blame you for or think was intentional. \n\nHonesty and open communication are the only 2 real staples to great relationships. The parts you can't live with out. You were honest, but clearly you weren't open about how you felt from day onr. Now everyone is in a spot they feel stuck in and no one wants to risk further hurting a 15 year old who so desperately needs a stable environment. \n\nI won't call you the Ahole, I will however say if she leaves you then you better never complain. Choosing to be child free is not the same as not being willing to help out family in need. Those are indeed 2 very different concepts. She made her choice.

The status quo remains assumed. Obviously they talked about Lucas coming to stay with them, which OP presumably agreed to (without expressing boundaries on timeline) and then OP has been involved in continued convos without expressing that boundary or his feelings.

Because an adult absolutely needs his wife (who's also going through a difficult time) to center him and invite him to the conversation with \"is it ok if I look for a school for Lucas?\" because the invitation of \"I'm going to start looking for a school for Lucas\" isn't a good enough invite. The witch, clearly she's in the wrong! (again, no idea how that conversation went, he didn't tell us)", "That's not a discussion that's someone telling you what their doing.  Wouldn't you say before looking for schools OP wife should have sat with him and asked how he feels about the child living there long term. \n\nClearly she didn't or he can't say, I didn't sign up for this.", "So there's no blame on the partner who's planning a long term commitment without discussing it with their partner?  That's seems to be the main issue that he was never asked to do these things. They never discussed it. She just assumed he won't mind because she loves her brother. \n\nJust like many sons want to take care of their mom when they're old. But if they want to do that they need to make sure their partner agrees first.  \n\nTruthfully I wouldn't be surprised if they actually sat down and had a conversation about the future he wouldn't have been as rude about it.  But after months after his life been changed with no input from him, it didn't come out the best due to frustration.", "Ok I was wrong with communication better word they should have discussed it. Not her telling him what he's doing without his input. \n\nAlso kinda strange that you think because he agreed for the summer means that means of course he doesn't mind if he stays for 3+ years.  You also point out we have no idea how the conversation went after listing how you believe it went \n\nAlso  I said NAH because I understand the wife's side she wasn't thinking about her husband she was focused on her brother I don't fault her for that. Just like I'm faulting OP for keeping his feelings to himself and sucking it up because he knows his wife cares.  \n\nMaybe don't assume what I think about this woman because you're 100% wrong.

Not just her telling him what she's planning", "I do not think he needs to be ok with Lucas staying permanently. I think that he hasn't been ok this whole time, has been hiding that, and then accused his wife of manipulating him. \n\nAnd no, I don't know how the discussion about schools went. But I do know he was at least in some way part of that discussion and did not communicate his boundaries about it.

It is the sibling's responsibility to ensure this isn't a burden for their family, so it is the wife's problem now.\n\nNo obligation for husband to shoulder responsibility of their baggage.
