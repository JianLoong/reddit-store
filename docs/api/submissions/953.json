For obvious reasons, they had to postpone their wedding until Dec 2022. \n\nSince then, I have moved across the world. It\u2019s been a massive emotional and financial thing. But, I always intended to go back for her wedding.\n\nI went to RSVP a year ago and it said only I was invited (no guest). I thought they were being tactful, as I had just ended a long-term relationship, so I asked Mary and she said that they didn\u2019t want randoms at their wedding. This meant I would have to travel across the world to a place by myself. It was a bit daunting, as the place is super dangerous, but I figured that it was worth the anxiety to be there.\n\nI had a couple of other hiccups in the planning phase. The bridesmaids were asked to spend the night before and the night after the wedding at the venue. Which meant we each had to pay for 3 nights' accoms. It was expensive, so us bridesmaids decided to rent a room together and just share beds. We suggested to the bride and groom that we plan a brunch for the day after the wedding and they said they\u2019d prefer to spend their first day as a married couple alone. I tried to ask about transport and where I would stay when I arrived, and I got \u201cwe\u2019ll make a plan\u201d. My friend isn\u2019t reliable when it comes to this stuff, so I was a bit nervous. I decided to rent a b&b and get a taxi (again, super dangerous). \n\nThis year, my other best friend, Sam, got engaged and asked me to be MOH. She offered to pay for my accommodation and make sure I was fetched from the airport and taken care of during my travels, as they knew I\u2019d be traveling alone. I had been budgeting for Mary\u2019s wedding, but seeing as Sam would be paying for everything except flights, I knew I could do both. \n\nWhen I got back, I paid off my credit card and went to book my flights for Mary\u2019s wedding. The tickets had tripled in price. They were now costing \u00a31600 just for international flights. I worked out all the costs involved and it would cost \u00a33000 just for the 4-day event. \n\nI could justify spending that if I knew I\u2019d be spending quality time with my friend, or even seeing family after. I ultimately decided that I simply couldn\u2019t afford to go into debt for a few hours of happiness. I spoke to my friend and she blew up.\n\nShe accused me of choosing Sam over her and brought up stuff from our past that I didn\u2019t even know was an issue. She said she\u2019d never expected me to pay that amount of money, but that I had two years to plan my trip. She also said that I should have expected the prices to go up because of the war and the recession. Mary also told me that I couldn\u2019t understand how important the day is because I\u2019m not getting married. She kept going on about how it\u2019s not the money that\u2019s making her angry, but that I didn\u2019t prioritize her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667402032, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yk7vek/aita_for_not_saving_enough_for_friends_wedding/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Expecting her bridesmaids to be there the night AFTER the wedding? When the couple wants to be alone that day anyway? WHY? That is so unrealistic and makes zero sense. \n\nAlso, I don't think you can book plane tickets two years out?", "NTA \n\nSo she thinks you should be able to predict a war and it's global economic impacts and save \u00a33000 to pay for her four day event. Unless you have a really amazingly paid job and have a tendency towards frugality, this is really a huge ask from her.", "NTA. Expecting someone to put themselves into financial hardship to attend a wedding is an AH move. Circumstances changed because of world events and you can no longer afford to go. Your friend should understand that.", "NTA\nI would unfortunatly do the same. If my bridesmaid (who lives in Australia and I live in Sweden so half way round the world) tells me this I would try to pay everything for her. But spending that much for 4 days.... not a chance! What country is it you are going to?", "Her expectations of you are unfair and unrealistic. She doesn't even sound like a very nice person, why are you friends with her? \n\nNTA", "NTA\nIf it would cost me over 500 euro for a friend's wedding, i'd pass. Unless it involved much more than just the wedding and 1-2 days around it. So you're totally justified in deciding not to go :)", "NTA You can't magic money up out of nowhere. She's making big financial demands, even with flights aside, and not helping you with any of the logistics even though you're travelling a huge distance to be there. \n\nShe should be prioritised on her big day, sure. But not every day between now and then. How has she demonstrated that she's holding your presence as a priority? Besides demands, guilt trips and bringing up every perceived slight she's had for the last number of years. She sounds like a really poor friend.", "NTA.  Your so called friend is very selfish.  She has a vision that no one else needs to support.  Wish her well.  You'll likely never hear from her again and that would be true even if you had attended her wedding.\n\nOr, you can try again for her next wedding.  Bad Katz predicts there will be at least one more.", "NTA\n\nI do not understand anyone expecting members of the wedding party to spend hundreds of dollars of their own money to participate, you get into the thousands and it seems completely insane.", "NTA\n\nExpecting your guests to go that far in debt for your wedding is entitled and unrealistic. It doesn't sound like your friend actually cares about you at all.", "NTA, being asked to participate in a wedding should not cause you a financial burden.  The bride should be footing the bill for the accommodations at the very least.  Postponing the wedding doesn't mean you should postpone your life.  You can't plan dates for something that hasn't been set yet.\n\nYou should also be able to decline the invitation if you feel like the price is too high, without blowback.\n\nHow does this person qualify as a best friend?", "NTA", "NTA:  She somehow expected you to know two years ago that there was going to be a war and recession?  And the extra days of stay/expenses even though you won't be spending that time with her? \n\nThat amount of expense is crippling for many people, she shouldn't expect anyone to be spending that much to be in a wedding.", "NTA.  You seem thoughtful and a good friend.  Likely you could have bought those tickets ahead of time and then wouldn't have the price increase, but sounds like a volatile area and who knows if that would have helped.", "NTA, that amount of money for a wedding is ridiculous. She sees it as you choosing someone else\u2019s wedding, but that one didn\u2019t cost you anything. If she really wanted you there, she could help with the costs, considering that you live a long distance away. \n\nJust out of curiosity, where is she that is so dangerous?", "NTA. She wants to put a crap ton of expenses on her bridesmaids and put them in debt, she risks losing them. She\u2019s asking for too much unnecessary commitment. She needs to downsize and be more realistic", "NTA. Unsafe travel alone AND that cost. That's unreasonable on both parts. She should be thinking of her guests more and the costs associated with HER \"big day\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s really dangerous most of the time, but especially in December.

A friend would never expect you to travel alone to area you know is dangerous. You were wise to back out.", "Exactly! I mean I get them wanting to spend the time together of course, but to ask you guys to stay an extra night?", "I would be willing to bet that they were offered a discount on their wedding package if they coerced enough guests to pay to stay in the hotel for 3 nights each.", "In the weddings I've been in, you need to bring everything with you at the end of the event.

NO WAY NTA", "I totally understand. I am sorry for you that she doesnt\u2764\ufe0f", "That sounds like its a bit one sided.

(Not a sexist thing, just a reality). And December is the worst time for crime in the country. I grew up there and I won\u2019t get into the things I\u2019ve experienced, but it\u2019s an extra stressor when traveling there.", "Ding ding ding!!", "She has been in the past, but in different ways. I\u2019m a very level-headed person and I prefer to work through my own problems. It takes a lot for me to go to someone else with my stuff. So when I went to her saying I couldn\u2019t afford this, I assumed she\u2019d be upset but understanding. I never expected her to throw it in my face. There\u2019s a lot more than was written in the post (character limits) but she said some truly hurtful things.", "It\u2019s an absolutely beautiful country! I love so much about it. But, unfortunately, crime is part and parcel. It\u2019s something to be aware of when traveling there, and makes me stressed. \n\nI definitely recommend safaris, as they\u2019re a safer activity crime wise. And Cape Town isn\u2019t as bad as some parts.", "Your assumption about how she would react is realistic. I wouldn't go into debt for any amount for someone who said hurtful things to me", "I\u2019ll keep that in mind. How is Johannesburg?  I wanted to see both it and Cape Town.", "I lived in Johannesburg for a while and I enjoyed it for the people. It\u2019s just a big city, so there\u2019s not much to see architectural or nature wise. But it\u2019s a good starting point for trips to Kruger National Park and surrounds. In terms of crime, it\u2019s not great. Definitely need to be aware of surroundings, especially when driving. \n\nCape Town is beautiful and a great spot for tourists. Lots to do in Cape Town and some truly spectacular wine farms all over the place. On the safer side, but still need to be conscious of what you\u2019re doing. \n\nI don\u2019t want to scare you off. It\u2019s a beautiful place and the people are lovely. You just have to have your wits about you and make smart choices when out and about. And have good insurance.", "I\u2019ll keep that in mind. I\u2019ve been many places (including the Middle East and Southeast Asia) and I\u2019ve learned to be aware and not get complacent, so I\u2019m not scared off. :)\n\nHopefully I\u2019ll get there in a few years.", "NTA", "No, but she could have booked six months ahead instead of six weeks. Tickets usually shoot up in price the closer you get to departure.\n\nStill NTA, because it sounds like this bride is of the school that believes the world is supposed to rotate around her wedding, and you\u2019re never an AH for saying no to unreasonable people.", "Oh he'll no. Deadly expensive location. Don't go. NTA.", "When someone tries to attack you personally, to hurt your feelings so they can win a fight, deep down they know they don't have the high ground in terms of morale or logic. You don't resort to such low blows when common sens is with you.\n\nThings might be crazy with the wedding coming up and all, but i believe that when you love someone, you don't actively try to hurt them. She did just that when shr told you those things. Tried to hurt you so that you would fall in line", "Yep. Yet another wedding thread where the guests are manipulated into financing the bride. People shouldn't allow themselves to be used like that."]}
