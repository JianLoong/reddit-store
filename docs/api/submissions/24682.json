The couple asked for cash wedding gifts only, so most guests would pay $200 while some had the option to pay $100 (10 available spots). My gf asked the bride if there was room for a plus 1 and the bride said she could bring me if I paid $200 for my attendance (not as a wedding gift).\n\nMy gf is upset with me because she went through the trouble of asking the bride if it was possible and thought I would be happy with this. I didn't ask for my gf to do this. My gf initially told me I was invited because she assumed she would get a plus 1 but turns out I wasn't invited and she felt bad about it. I don't blame her nor the couple because weddings are expensive. It would cost the couple $200/person for the wedding.\n\nThe bride isn't happy with me because my gf told her I wanted to attend and thought it was cheap of me only to back out now that I had to pay to attend.\n\nMy gf says there's no difference between being invited to a wedding and giving a $200 wedding gift like everyone else and being invited if I pay for my seat upfront. Especially since I would have given the same amount as a wedding gift if I was invited initially, and the end result would be the same (we give a total of $400).\n\nTo me it feels like an entrance fee that only I have to pay.\n\nAITA for not wanting to attend the wedding because I was asked to pay?\n\nEdit: My gf says that this is no different than in my culture where cash wedding gifts are normal and we give enough to cover our plate and extra. But in my culture, no one asks for an upfront fee or a specific amount but we all give a generous amount.\n\nEdit 2: My gf is also willing to pay the $200 but I'm not comfortable with that either because she doesn't have an income currently. I also mentioned to her not to ask the bride if she could have a plus 1 so I didn't know until after.\n\nEdit 3: The bride is insisting that my gf goes because she preciously decided not attending. My gf didn't want to go alone especially since she'll have to crash at my place in the end since it's far for her. The bride told her it's rude not to attend so my gf feels more obligated to go now.", "created_utc": 1692099132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rq35t/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_to_attend_a_wedding/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In my circles, we're more 100\u20ac per person, if you bring a +1 that doesn't really know the couple maybe even just 150\u20ac as a couple. \nThem \"offering\" 10 discounted tickets for 100$ must be the most insane thing about all of this.

But, when a guest is asked, or required to pay that much, then they\u2019ll feel more like a customer, or a sucker, than a guest. A terrible idea for a wedding.

I wouldn't pay to attend a wedding. There's a reason I eloped- I think expensive weddings are stupid. I'm all for celebrating people getting married, but the entitled expectation that I pay them?

Apparently most guests haven't met the groom either because they're getting married in under a year after meeting on Tinder.", "I am from a country where giving cash gifts is kind of the norm, but people don't expect to pay a certain amount upfront because everyone's payment ability is different. I don't know how expensive $200 is in the US, but from other comments, it sounds like it's expensive to give away as a wedding gift.

Almost all of our guests were traveling to be at our wedding. We did say that if anyone wanted to give a gift, they could contribute to our \"first home fund\".

Of course it's unfortunate that your gf already asked the bride whether you could attend, but you didn't know it would cost this much to go and I think it's not reasonable for them to expect you to just pay 200$ to attend the party of people you don't really know. Not everybody can afford that. (Sidenote on affording things: isn't it normal for the ones getting married to make a bit of a deficit with their wedding party? They're getting the celebration and the memories out of this? I can't believe they say it costs them X amount of money for you to be there and that's exactly what you have to pay back.
