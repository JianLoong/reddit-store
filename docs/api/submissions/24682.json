The couple asked for cash wedding gifts only, so most guests would pay $200 while some had the option to pay $100 (10 available spots). My gf asked the bride if there was room for a plus 1 and the bride said she could bring me if I paid $200 for my attendance (not as a wedding gift).\n\nMy gf is upset with me because she went through the trouble of asking the bride if it was possible and thought I would be happy with this. I didn't ask for my gf to do this. My gf initially told me I was invited because she assumed she would get a plus 1 but turns out I wasn't invited and she felt bad about it. I don't blame her nor the couple because weddings are expensive. It would cost the couple $200/person for the wedding.\n\nThe bride isn't happy with me because my gf told her I wanted to attend and thought it was cheap of me only to back out now that I had to pay to attend.\n\nMy gf says there's no difference between being invited to a wedding and giving a $200 wedding gift like everyone else and being invited if I pay for my seat upfront. Especially since I would have given the same amount as a wedding gift if I was invited initially, and the end result would be the same (we give a total of $400).\n\nTo me it feels like an entrance fee that only I have to pay.\n\nAITA for not wanting to attend the wedding because I was asked to pay?\n\nEdit: My gf says that this is no different than in my culture where cash wedding gifts are normal and we give enough to cover our plate and extra. But in my culture, no one asks for an upfront fee or a specific amount but we all give a generous amount.\n\nEdit 2: My gf is also willing to pay the $200 but I'm not comfortable with that either because she doesn't have an income currently. I also mentioned to her not to ask the bride if she could have a plus 1 so I didn't know until after.\n\nEdit 3: The bride is insisting that my gf goes because she preciously decided not attending. My gf didn't want to go alone especially since she'll have to crash at my place in the end since it's far for her. The bride told her it's rude not to attend so my gf feels more obligated to go now.", "created_utc": 1692099132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rq35t/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_to_attend_a_wedding/", "score": 831, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But, when a guest is asked, or required to pay that much, then they\u2019ll feel more like a customer, or a sucker, than a guest. A terrible idea for a wedding.

Do you see how that is different from charging a set amount to attend a wedding?", "This is the only wedding story I want to keep in my brain.", "The invite had a gift registry attached because they asked only cash gifts and majority were $200 cash, but some $100, so in my opinion it's whoever picks the $100 gift gets to pay it, and the rest has to pay what is left over.", "That's not what I said at all. I base my gifts on many things, relationship to bride/groom, my financial situation, and what I think is deserved.\n\nPersonally, I find it weird to ask to bring a guest to a wedding unless it's a new relationship and your friend didn't know you had a significant other. Even at that, if they've only invited a certain number of people, it's their choice. Either finances, desired intimacy of the event, whatever. It's your choice to attend or not, nobody is obligated to do so.\n\nI'm assuming that the couple just made the cost per plate known and there's a lot of miscommunication here. I have friends who lost a ton on their weddings for going way too big. I have never given anything more than I could afford.\n\nAlso, the bride isn't charging an invited guest the mandatory $200 fee. She's charging the mandatory fee for a guest who invited themselves.", "People have been declining to attend this tacky ass wedding but the bride and groom have likely already paid for most of it, at a price point that reflects the number of guests they were expecting. The bride just wants your girlfriends money to offset the cost of her wedding, she doesn't actually care about her attendance and it's shocking to me you and your gf haven't seemed to realize that", "You mean, the bride demanded your girlfriend come to the wedding to pay the massive entrance fee so she (bride) could make as much $$$ as possible? Yes, that\u2019s more accurate. Sorry, but this couple marrying are tacky and entitled and they only see this wedding and their guests as cash cows. The bride isn\u2019t insisting on people coming because she values their company. She\u2019s insisting because she wants people to fund her \u201cMe-Me Princess Party\u201d and make some extra spending money on the side. This bride is taking advantage of your girlfriend (and probably everyone else that attends). This isn\u2019t your problem, OP. I wouldn\u2019t go to this cash-grab either.", "What is rude is to set an entrance fee for attendees. The bride likely only cares about your girlfriend attending because that means extra money in the pot and it's why she readily accepted giving her a plus one. It's easy to expand a guest list when they're paying.", "I would suggest to your GF that she politely tell the \"friend\" that something came up. I think this idea of charging people per head to attend your wedding (she's basically trying to get her big lavish wedding paid for) is incredibly tacky. If you can't afford a $200 a person wedding, then don't throw one. Have something small and simple with only the people you are truly close to. This sounds like a greedy gift grab. I would stand firm and tell your GF that you are not going and that you would suggest she make polite excuses to this person she is not even close to. NTA", "Don't go to an expensive wedding if you don't want to help pay for it. That's what everyone does here.", "What bothers me is, why should I have to cover the cost of a meal that I didn't choose and wouldn't pay as much for in a restaurant? On top of which, how am I supposed to know how much the meal cost? It could vary widely depending on where the wedding is being held.", "That's the tackiest thing I've ever heard of.", "That is a fee not a gift. Tacky AF.", "They're gonna get a bunch of ppl who ignore the registry entirely. This is a tacky AF way to beg for money. They might as well have started a GoFundMe. I would be tempted to either not go or bring a gift or like, $15 in ones that aren't even facing the same way lol", "Well luckily I don\u2019t know anyone with that much of a lack of manners so I don\u2019t have to worry about it. All of my friends got married years ago and none of them expected me to chip in. We were all adults who funded our own lives, you know, like adults do.", "So tacky. It's a money grab.", "Wedding back in the 60s or whenever you were young probably cost a fraction of what they cost now. The world has changed. Guests don't want to attend weddings without gourmet food, perfect lighting, perfect music, dance floor and DJ (or live band), a cameraman or two, parking and clean toilets and decorations. Young couples are also expected to invite dozens or even hundreds of people, many of whom they never met. They simply can't afford it. It would've been much nicer to go back to a ceremony of 30 people in a church or synagogue, in which case no one would be expected to help cover the costs.", "I got married in 03, but thanks for making me 70. This tacky shit is new, within the last few years, it definitely was not a thing where I\u2019m from in the 90s or 00s. And not everyone has a perfect Instagram wedding, the internet lied to you, imagine that. Some people get married to actually be married, not for the hashtags.", "YTA everybody has to pay so how is this a fee just for you?", "It may be tacky but that's not what the OP is asking. The OP is asking if he's being an asshole for not wanting to go. This is obviously important to his girlfriend and he doesn't have to shell out any money. He just needs to show up. Instead he decided to cause drama.", "You should NEVER try to recoup the cost of awedding. Ever. Register, and if anybody asks directly what you want then tell them, but that\u2019s IT. Any effort made in this direction is rude, point blank.", "Don\u2019t disrespect the cultural practices of Cheapminastan!", "Well I also have a set fee whereas other people at least have the option of paying $100. I have to pay double.", "Not different. The guests don't get to pick where they are seated. They're seated the normal way (families at tables closest to the couple). The cash gift registry doesn't have an effect on where you sit. By spots, I mean only 10 attendees can pick to give $100 and then there are no $100 gifts available. Everyone else will have to pay $200.", "Yeah, but by the same token, it's also really tacky to ask if you can bring a plus one if you weren't given a plus one. ESH", "Especially since most wedding food is mediocre and shouldn't cost near $100 a plate.", "Yeah that cash gift registry sounds weird. Only 10 people get the chance to pay 100 and everyone has to double that?", "If your gift doesn't cost more than your seat, why do you think you are valuable enough that they'd want you there?", "Yes! I went to a wedding where it was printed on the invitation \u201cYour presence is our present\u201d", "But in that case, the bride and groom are being equal opportunity rude.  Even under the guise of it being a gift, everyone is being told to pay a certain amount.  That's why, rather than quibble over whether it's a gift or an entrance charge (both of which have the same effect), I opted for \"I can't afford it\"  -- the \"it\" being indeterminate.", "I would be mortified if one of my children were doing this at their wedding. It's so inappropriately tacky. I'm suprised other people are going.", "Graciously decline and send an etiquette book as a gift in the mail.", "Ya totally bizarre. Totally agree with you that there  is an expectation for a gift but I would never judge someone for not giving or giving less. You never know someone\u2019s financial situation. Leaves you in a bad spot since your gf is the one who\u2019s close to this person. It\u2019s kind of on her to decide how to approach this but def NTA", "\u201c10 spots for giving \u201conly\u201d 100$\u201d\u2026. WTF?! I mean it\u2019s understandable to ask for cash but to set specific amounts like this (and max. 10 guests are allowed to pay the lower amount - even though there may be others who can\u2019t afford 200$) is just \u2026 I don\u2019t have a word for it right now \u2026", "Why did they feel the need to specifically say \"no gifts\" if that's the norm? Or is that literally the only wedding/birthday you've ever been invited to?", "Right?!! It's beyond", "Make it $10,000 instead of $100 and it sounds like a Trump rally", "Tacky, uncouth, arrogant, entitled, ridiculous. Pick one or more.", "How about tacky with a capital T \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude09", "My mother in law did this for her 50th. Had a big bash and asked for dog supplies. It was awesome", "My best friend and I were queens of grabbing up and  splitting the cost of salt and pepper shakers on registries. Charging for a wedding then guiltiling to attend???? Let your girlfriend do as she wants and when she's out $400 and never hears from the self serving  bride again, it will be money well spent.", "And that's the right way to do it! If we had done a registry I would have made sure to put items of all price points on it. I've seen wedding registries that are nothing but big ticket items and it comes across as greedy. It's fine if you want to put the $400 Kitchen Aid stand mixer, or $800 full service coffee/Espresso maker on it but also add the cloth napkins and dish towels for those with a smaller budget.", "I mentioned they were American but they're right, they are white. I come from an asian culture where we give cash gifts, so my gf was trying to tell me what they are doing is no different (she also added, arguably better) than what my culture does.", "She is only insisting that she goes for the $$$ because people don't want to attend it.   \n\n\nNTA", "It is a kindness and a general guide to give a gift that is equivalent to your plate. It is not a requirement. If someone is unable to afford $200 and the couple wants them there, it would be very uncouth to expect them to shell out cash they don't have.\n\nAn invitation is not a demand letter.", "Rent free. Some people can't help but make everything political. Get a grip on reality. There's more to life", "There were 10 available spots for poors who could only afford $100. They were trying to be flexible?", "Ding, ding, ding, ding... We have a winner here. Exactl!, Where is the money coming from. Offering to pay for her (OP) when she probably does not have how to do it. And, who is going to pay for her dress and makeup and hair. Hmmmm. If she guilt trip her into going, she will be responsible for those costs, too.", "If anyone pulled this and invited me, they\u2019d get something from the regift closet.", ">in ones that aren't even facing the same way \n\n\ud83d\ude02 I love this! \ud83e\udd23", "The SNL Christmas peach candle song comes to mind"]}
