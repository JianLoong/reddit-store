English is my 2nd language.\n\nI (20F) have an older brother (23) and a younger brother (14). My older brother, let\u2019s call him Derek, is a self-proclaimed \u201cprankster\u201d. I put it in quotes because frankly I just think he\u2019s a moron who likes to humiliate people and call it a prank. He used to prank me too until I called the police on him once and he\u2019s been avoiding me, calling me a stuck-up bitch.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t stopped pranking our younger brother (Jim) who hates the panks and our parents aren\u2019t doing anything about it. They say it\u2019s all in \u201cgood fun\u201d. Fuck that. Anyways, yesterday was Jim\u2019s birthday. We threw a party with some friends and relatives. I explicitly told Derek NO PRANKS, not even small ones. He was like, yeah yeah, whatever.\n\nEveryone arrives, we\u2019re having a good time and since Derek seems to be on his best behavior, I\u2019m focused on Jim. Dad brings the cake, we\u2019re all excited. Jim blows the candles (two with his age) and then mom takes off the candles to cut the cake. Before she has the time to do that, Derek rushes behind Jim, grabs his head and SHOVES his face into the cake, hard. It was a fraction of a second, none of us even had the time to react!\n\nThe family and friends laughed, but I was mortified. Then I realized Jim was struggling and I helped him get up and wiped his face carefully, starting with his eyes. He hissed in pain and when I looked closer, a piece of cake got stuck to his eye and the area around it was already becoming red. Jim started to cry in pain, I was panicking, mom was panicking. I don\u2019t know what the hell the rest of the family were doing, but I grabbed Jim and said \u201clet\u2019s go to the ER now!\u201d\n\nThen I hear Derek saying something like, \u201coh there she goes being a stuck-up bitch and exaggerating. He\u2019s fine. Clean it \\[the eye\\] with some water.\u201d\n\nAt this point I was really angry, Jim was scared and trembling, so I told Derek that he\u2019s the biggest imbecile in whole universe and he needs fucking therapy to stop with these stupid pranks. I kinda wanted to keep going, but I left it at that and went to the ER with Jim. He\u2019s all right. They said the cake irritated his left eye and they cleaned him up with a special solution.\n\nWhen we returned, the party was done, Jim\u2019s friends went home and the family blasted me for what I told Derek in front of everybody. They said it was all in good fun and now Derek is sad and locked himself in the guest room. I said I don\u2019t give a shit and he needs to do something about his immature attitude. He\u2019s the oldest, but acts like a toddler. No, actually I know toddlers who are better behaved than him!\n\nI am STILL getting messages, telling me to apologize to Derek. I refuse to ever do that especially since Jim thanked me for taking care of him and being on his side. Am I really the asshole? I don\u2019t think I am, but I want neutral opinions.", "created_utc": 1680351969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128kv9x/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_is_the_biggest/", "score": 1321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If that\u2019s the case, this is going to be a really difficult conversation to have because it forces your parents to confront some heavy and unpleasant truths about themselves. Of course my hypothesis could be way off-base (I really hope so) and you can get both your parents involved, I\u2019m just raising concerns for you to think about and dismiss or consider as you see fit.\n\nIf you think they\u2019ll be open, ask them what they think the difference is between pranks and bullying, and where they would draw the line.

Come in armed with examples pre-written, especially if you have proof that the events happened (like photos) so your parents can\u2019t gaslight you.\n\nI\u2019d write out a chart where it lists your brother\u2019s actions, the outcome for him (feeling good, some laughs, etc.) and the outcome for the other person (danger, boundaries violated, loss of control over autonomy, disrespect, negative emotional response, disappointment, etc.) and then ask why the benefits to your brother should outweigh the costs to his victims. Write out what boundaries he has broken with each \u201cprank\u201d, and why that\u2019s concerning. Write out the power dynamic (age, physical size, gender, etc.) of the people your brother is \u201cpranking\u201d, and whether or not your brother is violating physical boundaries, such as in this case, versus other boundaries such as autonomy or safety. They\u2019re probably going to dismiss these things, as they\u2019ve been doing all along, because the actual *act* your brother committed was a \u201csmall one\u201d. Let them know it\u2019s not at all about the action but about the intent and reasoning behind it; the way your brother is seeing other people\u2019s wants and needs as less valuable than his own is a slippery slope. Additionally, even if it\u2019s a number of small examples it\u2019s also a pattern, and that has impacts beyond each of the singular occurrences. But most importantly, the thoughts and behaviours and values permitting him to do these actions are NOT acceptable. His actions matter a little less (in the context of this discussion) than his intent and the result of the *pattern* of these actions. It\u2019s like death by a thousand cuts, and your younger brother deserves to feel safe, respected, valued, and loved in his own home.\n\nIf you can, try to explain that you\u2019re concerned because someone who values humour and his own gratification over respecting other people\u2019s right to safety, autonomy, or self worth is a very dangerous mentality, even if it\u2019s only manifesting in small acts of control and boundary stomping (so far). Let your folks make the obvious inferences between violating these boundaries with small acts, and violating these boundaries with larger ones, such as sexual assault (because this was a physical assault, btw) if they\u2019re able to do so. If they just aren\u2019t willing to accept the danger of this mentality, it may require a more heavy handed approach where you tell them that this is the exact same mentality abusive partners hold and use to justify their actions which make them feel good and in control at the expense of those around them.\n\nIt\u2019s not a one-off cake pushing event, but a consistent pattern of thought and control and domineering that is indicative of some very, very scary lapses in empathy and respect of others.\n\nI highly doubt your parents, who have been so blind to the magnitude of your brother\u2019s actions to date, will be open to this conversation but for the sake of yourself and your brother I think it\u2019s incumbent upon you to try. Besides, once you lay it all out and see their reaction, you\u2019ll have a better idea of where to go from here based on how they react, and how to protect yourself and your little brother and help him protect himself as well.\n\nAlso, be aware that sometimes the person in the family (unfortunately it\u2019s so often the eldest daughter, and I\u2019m sorry for the struggle you face- I empathize) who first sets boundaries against the abuse is attacked instead of the person whose actions they\u2019re calling out. You will likely be accused of rocking the boat, causing a problem where there is none, overreacting (you\u2019re not!! Don\u2019t forget that) and creating drama. Don\u2019t accept that.\n\nPlenty of people have explained this boat analogy more eloquently than I, but the gist of it is this: in abusive family dynamics there\u2019s the one who is doing the abusive behaviour- they rock the boat. But everyone else is so used to jumping from side to side to keep the family boat balanced that when you refuse to move yourself around the boat to keep the whole fucked up system from tipping over, the other apologists will blame you for no longer helping to stabilize the boat instead of placing the blame where it belongs- on the person rocking it. It\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not fair, and it\u2019s not true, but to them it makes sense. It\u2019s easier to manipulate someone to stay in the boat and help stabilize it than it is to accuse the person rocking the boat of trying to drown everyone in the first place\u2026 that\u2019s a dangerous to do because the boat rocker *is* dangerous in a way that the other passengers are not. They\u2019re the one upsetting the system, and calling out their poor actions may cause them to finally tip the boat.\n\nIf the conversation doesn\u2019t work, if they don\u2019t listen, if they listen but aren\u2019t in the space to protect you and make positive changes, its time to start looking into how you can get yourself and your brother get out of the boat. Until then, if the best you can do is offer him a life preserver (after you put on your own) then that\u2019s enough. You\u2019re doing a good thing, OP, in helping your brother. Don\u2019t forget to wear your own life jacket in the process.\n\nEdit: forgot to say, NTA!", "I would say you need to hold an intervention with your parents to make them aware of the bullying.
