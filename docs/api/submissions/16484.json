She doesn't need to be subbing in schools at all with that attitude", "YWNBTA. I'm not teaching expert but that sounds horrible", "NTA, you would be if you DONT stand up for those kids. It\u2019s not the other student\u2019s responsibility to manage that child - it\u2019s the subs. And those poor kids didn\u2019t learn shit that 2hrs they were focused on keep themselves dry.

Call the school.", "When my kid was in 3rd grade, a recess monitor did this kind of thing\u2014whole class had to wait to go on for lunch until everyone stopped talking. Needless to say, the clock ran out on lunch. My kid took it upon herself to write a sternly-worded letter to the principal objecting to this collective punishment. And to his great credit, the principal came to the class in person to apologize for what happened and to let them know that the recess monitors had been told not to do that again. \n\nSo yeah, I would talk to the principal.", "NTA This sounds like abuse. She was a bully to this little boy. Then she deprived these little kids of a basic need. Something they really needed. She needs to be reported ASAP.", "YWNBTA Report the heck out of that.", "NTA   Call now", "NTA.  Personally I would try to verify with other parents first before sending the email, but only because a friend of mine nearly lost her teaching position over a student making up stories. Not saying that\u2019s the case here, I\u2019m just paranoid like that", "NTA. But I would not accuse - I would ask. Because kids also misinterpret things all the time. To them, they are relaying the absolute truth. But sometimes it\u2019s not actually how it happened. \n\nFor example, my students tell me all the time that teachers have yelled at them. They genuinely believe it but the teacher hasn\u2019t raised their voice to a yell. They\u2019ve just been firm or a bit louder than usual. But to a kid with a trauma background and limited emotional vocabulary, the only word they might know to convey that their teacher spoke firmly or sternly and loudly to them is \u201cyelled\u201d.\n\nOr they\u2019ve said, \u201cthe teacher told me she hates me\u201d when what the teacher actually said is, \u201cyou\u2019re not welcome in this classroom if you are going to swear at other students or me\u201d. To a kid with rejection sensitivity either because they are neurodivergent or because they have trauma \u201cI hate you\u201d is what they hear. \n\nSo the \u201cmake mean faces\u201d might not actually be the case. \n\nAlso, I hope the experience of having a terrible sub commits you to improving the pay and working conditions of teachers. Because while they remain so low, schools have no one else other than teachers like these to put in front of kids.\n\nETA: the bathroom thing is inexcusable and absolutely something to complain about.", "NTA\n\nPlease report this.  All of it.", "WIBTA . If you don't report, her.", "NTA. The school definitely needs to know about the sub\u2019s unacceptable behavior and that children were denied a bathroom break.

The kids are what, 7 years old? Encouraging bullying and using access to the bathroom as a punishment is not ok", "NTA and you need to contact all the parents so they know as well. That is bullying and inhumane to not let them use the bathroom. Wtf!?!? So they just let anyone teach kids huh? Smfh", "NTA, but really the only issue I have with her actions is the amount of time.

Making access to the FUCKING BATHROOM for some children contingent on the behavior or some OTHER CHILD is also fucking insane.\n\nReport this sub.", "NTA, definitely ask questions and express concern. Even if your son just misinterpreted it is important to communicate with the school. \n\nHowever, please also look into counseling or some kind of support for your son. Flipping over a desk is not an acceptable or safe response for himself or the other students in the classroom. Unfortunately, I spent a year substitute teaching in elementary school. The amount of students who threw furniture and hurt or almost hurt other students was shocking to me. The students who reacted so extremely were dysregulated and had a really hard time in school.", "NTA", "NTA- that teacher is abusive.", "I typed up an email and scheduled it to send Monday morning.

Second the recommendation.", "Having once been married to a teacher I know they deserve so much more than they get.", "Send ASAP - that sub could be in front of another class on Monday.", "Why wait till Monday?", "Good, don't cancel it, regardless of the decision here. I'm fairly confident it'll come out in your favor, but either way, you have to do what you believe is right when it comes to your children.", "Because the staff is already out for the day, they leave at 4.

NTA, good dad!", "Ok, that's understandable. You're definitely not overreacting.", "NTA but I would talk to the parents you know about of other students in the class. See if they heard something similar. And if you all have the same stories, encourage them to reach out too. I\u2019m generally not one for sending an army but given the severity of the situation, I\u2019d want the administration to pull that sub immediately.", "NTA. \n\nPlease report this teacher.

As a mom sometimes my kids think I\u2019m yelling or being mean when I\u2019m speaking firmly, setting a rule they don\u2019t like, explaining that they did something wrong. I try hard to be self aware and yes sometimes I yell but sometimes I\u2019m not raising my voice at all, I\u2019m just saying something firmly that they don\u2019t want to hear.", "Also thinking all of this. Sometimes kids aren't intentionally lying even though they're really wrong about how events went down.", "Sorry let me be clearer. It was not my son that flipped the desk. It was a classmate.", "Bullying does not project authority,it creates fear,anger and negativity.", "Send it now. My mom's school email is linked to her phone.

Please include that info in your email so they can get help for the other child", "The overstep was forcing these kids at that age to hold it for 2 hours. The act of delaying it alone would not be bullying. Command presence is vital for teachers, but especially for supply/substitutes.", "Admin keeps up with their email over the weekend.  I would send asap for time stamp purposes as well.", "This is not a problem with new meds, this is a problem with a substitute teacher.\n\nNTA", "However, a teacher might get ill over the weekend, and then the sub could show up on Monday in that class.
