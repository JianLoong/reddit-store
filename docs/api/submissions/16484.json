She doesn't need to be subbing in schools at all with that attitude", "YWNBTA. I'm not teaching expert but that sounds horrible", "NTA, you would be if you DONT stand up for those kids. It\u2019s not the other student\u2019s responsibility to manage that child - it\u2019s the subs. And those poor kids didn\u2019t learn shit that 2hrs they were focused on keep themselves dry.

Call the school.", "When my kid was in 3rd grade, a recess monitor did this kind of thing\u2014whole class had to wait to go on for lunch until everyone stopped talking. Needless to say, the clock ran out on lunch. My kid took it upon herself to write a sternly-worded letter to the principal objecting to this collective punishment. And to his great credit, the principal came to the class in person to apologize for what happened and to let them know that the recess monitors had been told not to do that again. \n\nSo yeah, I would talk to the principal.", "NTA This sounds like abuse. She was a bully to this little boy. Then she deprived these little kids of a basic need. Something they really needed. She needs to be reported ASAP.", "YWNBTA Report the heck out of that.", "NTA   Call now", "NTA.  Personally I would try to verify with other parents first before sending the email, but only because a friend of mine nearly lost her teaching position over a student making up stories. Not saying that\u2019s the case here, I\u2019m just paranoid like that", "NTA. But I would not accuse - I would ask. Because kids also misinterpret things all the time. To them, they are relaying the absolute truth. But sometimes it\u2019s not actually how it happened. \n\nFor example, my students tell me all the time that teachers have yelled at them. They genuinely believe it but the teacher hasn\u2019t raised their voice to a yell. They\u2019ve just been firm or a bit louder than usual. But to a kid with a trauma background and limited emotional vocabulary, the only word they might know to convey that their teacher spoke firmly or sternly and loudly to them is \u201cyelled\u201d.\n\nOr they\u2019ve said, \u201cthe teacher told me she hates me\u201d when what the teacher actually said is, \u201cyou\u2019re not welcome in this classroom if you are going to swear at other students or me\u201d. To a kid with rejection sensitivity either because they are neurodivergent or because they have trauma \u201cI hate you\u201d is what they hear. \n\nSo the \u201cmake mean faces\u201d might not actually be the case. \n\nAlso, I hope the experience of having a terrible sub commits you to improving the pay and working conditions of teachers. Because while they remain so low, schools have no one else other than teachers like these to put in front of kids.\n\nETA: the bathroom thing is inexcusable and absolutely something to complain about.", "NTA\n\nPlease report this.  All of it.", "WIBTA . If you don't report, her.", "NTA. The school definitely needs to know about the sub\u2019s unacceptable behavior and that children were denied a bathroom break. It sounds like the sub has limited experience with children.", "NTA but that sub can suck it.  \n\n\"Here class, everyone make angry faces at this other kid, and then I'm gonna punish you all for him talking too much\"", "NTA\n\nI would be pissed if my kid came home reporting that. The kids are what, 7 years old? Encouraging bullying and using access to the bathroom as a punishment is not ok", "NTA and you need to contact all the parents so they know as well. That is bullying and inhumane to not let them use the bathroom. Wtf!?!? So they just let anyone teach kids huh? Smfh", "NTA, but really the only issue I have with her actions is the amount of time.
