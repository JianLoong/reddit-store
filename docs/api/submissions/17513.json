The things she said to your son were appalling and cruel.  One of the most important duties of a parent is to protect your kids.  And that\u2019s exactly what you did.", "NTA. How dare she say that to a child. It has nothing to do with her at all.", "NTA I think what she did is unforgivable and can never be taken back. Unfortunately Kyle will never be able to unhear those words. As a parent it makes a lot of sense you got that pissed as of course your protective instinct kicks in and she also did all that behind your back.", "NTA I cannot think of a better way to show your child that his well-being is, to you, paramount. Your mother\u2019s actions are indefensible.", "NTA! Possibly you were overly emotional, but I for one won\u2019t blame you for that. Your mother massively overstepped and was clearly cruel and hurtful to your son. Your brother is also at fault for betraying your confidence.  \n\nPlus, they did this on his birthday!?!", "NTA not at all! You defended your child, as any parent should because what your mom said to him was reprehensible. I must ask though, why are your extended family members accusing you for overreacting?

I'm an adopted child as is my older sister. My parents told her, when she was in her early teens and ranting about \"you're not my parents\", etc (teenage angst) that if she were still interested in finding her biological parents when she turned 18, our parents would help her. It seems that you know Kyle loves you, and you love him, and you want to help him satisfy his curiosity about what his roots are. \n\nYour mom was totally out of line.

Deplorable behavior on her part.", "NTA. Your mom fucked up bad. If she was that upset she should have talked to you about it instead of going off on a *child*.

The line(s) she crossed are so far in the rear view that they\u2019re a haze shadow.

Sorry.", "Yes this. Thatbwoman is not thinking about the boy's well being, she is thinking about herself and using \"family\" as an excuse.\n\nI would personally go NC with her even if she apologized, because thats unforgivable behavior. If she had gone to OP and complained about it later, on a different day, then ok. She would still be wrong but at least she would have expressed her concerns andnhurt like a mature adult.\n\nBut no, she chosed to scream at a 16 yrs old, on his birthday, behind the parents back, and behave like a child throwing a tantrum. Theres no going back from that  Ifbshe didnt even try to apologize at this point, it just means she wont change and might hurt OP's children again.", "and on the boy's birthday!! Like that was double low", "I was thinking the same thing. Either the rest of the family heard a very different version of the story, ot they are all as bad as her and OP should go NC with all of them.\n\nI mean, I would not be surprised if she lied andntold the rest ofbthe family that she was polite and all that BS. Worst case scenario shebtells the family that OP's son lied to OP and made her look bad.", "NTA. And Kyle now knows that he can completely trust you to stand up for him, no matter what. For a 16 year old - and especially for an adopted child - that is EVERYTHING.

Sounds like you're 100% supportive of his sexuality as well.", "NTA\n\nHOLY FUCK your mom is a headcase.", "She does not consider him family and that is why she had no problem berating a teenager.

I\u2019m so glad you stood up for your child and protected him.  Has she even acknowledged or realized how wrong she is?", "NTA. She is a poor excuse for a grandmother and doesn't deserve to contact your children anymore. \n\nBut I think it's wonderful that you're supporting Kyle, even though it hurts to hear that he wants to know about his parents. Every kid deserves to learn who they are, and the fact that you're openly willing to help only shows him how much you love him.", "NTA. What she said to your son is cruel and she is the asshole. \n\nAlthough, I think your brother telling her is a crappy move. It should've been you telling her, maybe explaining how you support it & will help him in searching.", "NTA  and fuck your brother too! You asked him as a lawyer, and he totally blew your confidentiality out the window. He had no business involving your mother in this. I\u2019m so sorry!", "NTA\n\nYour mom had no right to even discuss that subject with them, let alone to attack them for wanting to meet their biological parents.\n\nYou 100% did the right thing, and honestly good on you for having your kid's back like that. I would totally high five you right now if I could lol", "[removed]", "NTA. I hope Kyle knows he is a gift, not unwanted. It's very normal for an adopted person to want more information. My brother and I are both adopted, my parents couldn't conceive. I never doubted my place in their lives because they always made sure we knew we helped fulfill their wish for children, and our bio families weren't at the right place/time to care for us the best they could. It's not always about want, it's usually about capability. My adoption was a gift to both sets of parents. So is Kyle's. Your mom is way out of line, I wouldn't let her anywhere near your kids. Also what kind of demon makes a kid cry on their birthday?? She could have brought her concerns to you later. Hugs to your kid and glad he has a supportive partner.", "NTA.\nWhat she did is stuff that does damage and requires therapy to work through.\nAnd for a kid who was adopted, there\u2019s already so many additional feelings they live with. (Every parent who adopts should expect that their child will want to learn or contact their bio parents, too.)\nAnyone who doesn\u2019t see that massive damage sucks and is gas lighting you by saying you overreacted.", "100% NTA. That is unforgivable.", "NTA    if you ever talk to her again ask her how it felt to be abandoned by you.\n\nThank you for understanding your son's desire to know where he came from, and realizing it doesn't mean he loves you any less. \n\nI met my bio mom when I was 21, if you have any questions at all DM me.", "The timeline doesn't add up.\n\n>We still tried for bio kids after adopting Kyle and we ended up with two more kids\n\nYou said you adopt Kyle THEN having your bio kids after.\n\nBut Kyle was 3 when you adopted him. And your oldest bio kid is 2 years younger than Kyle. It means when you adopt Kyle, your oldest bio kid was 1, meaning you had your bio kod before you adopt Kyle.\n\nHow was this possible here?\n\nI put this as creative writing for now.", "NTA at all what the heck", "No. As someone who is adopted I would\u2019ve screamed at my grandma myself. If I heard that shit omg that woman would\u2019ve been dragged by her hair out of the house. She does not understand his struggles with identity. She does not deserve any of your attention until she apologizes. And tell your family members to fuck off because they don\u2019t understand either. Being adopted is a blessing and a curse. It resulted in me having borderline because I would constantly search for who I was in the wrong places. He is trying to understand himself and where he came from and she never had to do that. The lack of information for 18 years fucks with your head so much. You just wonder and wonder. Even if it\u2019s bad, it relieves so much pain by knowing. It\u2019s like being ghosted but by people you never met. It\u2019s a weird feeling but it is consuming.", "NTA, but she is", "NTA and I knew where this was going. Your mom deserved to be kicked out and going NC with.", "NTA. You made her feel exactly like she made your son feel: Unwanted.", "NTA", "you did exactly what you should have done.
