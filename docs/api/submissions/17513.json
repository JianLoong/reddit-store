The things she said to your son were appalling and cruel.  One of the most important duties of a parent is to protect your kids.  And that\u2019s exactly what you did.", "NTA. How dare she say that to a child. It has nothing to do with her at all.", "NTA I think what she did is unforgivable and can never be taken back. Unfortunately Kyle will never be able to unhear those words. As a parent it makes a lot of sense you got that pissed as of course your protective instinct kicks in and she also did all that behind your back.", "NTA I cannot think of a better way to show your child that his well-being is, to you, paramount. Your mother\u2019s actions are indefensible.", "NTA! Possibly you were overly emotional, but I for one won\u2019t blame you for that. Your mother massively overstepped and was clearly cruel and hurtful to your son. Your brother is also at fault for betraying your confidence.  \n\nPlus, they did this on his birthday!?!", "NTA not at all! You defended your child, as any parent should because what your mom said to him was reprehensible. I must ask though, why are your extended family members accusing you for overreacting? Have they heard the full story or are they just going off of your mom's version?", "NTA\n\nYour job is to protect your son, which you did.\n\nYour mother said a shitty thing and needs to think about why it was shitty.", "NTA\n\nWhat grandma did what a simply stunning betrayal of trust that goes to very core of self doubt and insecurity of many adopted people. She fed the very nightmares he may have, the pieces he potentially is afraid to talk about to anyone yet.\n\nI am so sorry for him, and for you having to pick up the pieces.", "NTA. I'm an adopted child as is my older sister. My parents told her, when she was in her early teens and ranting about \"you're not my parents\", etc (teenage angst) that if she were still interested in finding her biological parents when she turned 18, our parents would help her. It seems that you know Kyle loves you, and you love him, and you want to help him satisfy his curiosity about what his roots are. \n\nYour mom was totally out of line. None of this is her decision, and while she may feel that Kyle is being an ingrate, this is none of her damn business.", "Definitely NTA. You stood up for your child and his desire to learn about his birth family.\n\nYour mother, on the other hand, is just...wow.", "NTA - Your mother is a cold and cruel person. Good riddance.", "NTA she was needlessly cruel to your son. Protect him and avoid using your brother for personal legal services", "She was actually able to walk out of your house and no medical aid was required? Good enough. She should never be allowed near your children again. There is no coming back from abuse that evil. She showed you, well and true, exactly who and what she is and I would sooner let my children play with poisonous snakes than allow someone that intrinsically awful anywhere near them. NTA.", "Nta if this is true. I wouldn't use your brother for an attorney though, he seems to have poor boundaries.  If you fostered him, you should know the names of his bio parents.  If you don't for some odd reason, I'd start with agency that placed him with you. It was likely a termination if rights, which is public record in most states.", "NTA, NTA, NTA\n\nWTF is wrong with your mother?!?  I wouldn't invite her back for his next birthday, either... or that of your two other kids.", "NTA \n\nGood for you.\n\nETA: \n\nI'm very sorry. It must be very painful, because we all to have a loving relationship with our mothers. You still picked the right person to protect, though. \n\nYour job as a parent is to protect your children.

Sorry.", "Yes this. Thatbwoman is not thinking about the boy's well being, she is thinking about herself and using \"family\" as an excuse.\n\nI would personally go NC with her even if she apologized, because thats unforgivable behavior. If she had gone to OP and complained about it later, on a different day, then ok. She would still be wrong but at least she would have expressed her concerns andnhurt like a mature adult.\n\nBut no, she chosed to scream at a 16 yrs old, on his birthday, behind the parents back, and behave like a child throwing a tantrum. Theres no going back from that  Ifbshe didnt even try to apologize at this point, it just means she wont change and might hurt OP's children again.", "and on the boy's birthday!! Like that was double low", "I was thinking the same thing. Either the rest of the family heard a very different version of the story, ot they are all as bad as her and OP should go NC with all of them.\n\nI mean, I would not be surprised if she lied andntold the rest ofbthe family that she was polite and all that BS. Worst case scenario shebtells the family that OP's son lied to OP and made her look bad."]}
