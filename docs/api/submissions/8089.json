He was extremely disrespectful to me and my parenting and childish to boot. He blamed his ADD and anxiety for his inability to clean, and his inability to keep a steady job. I paid all of the bills whether they were in my name or his. \n\nWe have a 5 year old daughter. I think he babies her, he never wanted to let her do things for herself and overall was raising her to be very entitled. I was working full time, usually 50 hour weeks, and he was staying home with her because \u2018his entire paycheck would just go to daycare\u2019 (his words). She started school last year with preschool and he finally started working again. However I was still paying all of the bills, including 960 for rent every month. We eventually co-signed on a car but he insisted on putting the title in his name and leaving me off insurance because I\u2019d had some accidents in the past. I agreed at the time to avoid a fight, but it wasn\u2019t long til I was responsible for that bill as well. \n\nDue to a series of events while he was living with me after we broke up, my daughter and I now have a restraining order against him. \nI have gone out of my way to make sure he has all the login information he needs for the bills in his name, but apparently that wasn\u2019t enough as he\u2019s been calling my mom complaining about me not helping him. He \u2018accidentally\u2019 paid his car insurance out of my account this month and is apparently unable to login to the car payment account. He called her on Sunday repeatedly complaining about being unable to login, I never received a verification email so I\u2019m not sure that he even tried, and my mom called me screaming that I need to \u2018put my big girl panties on and figure this out because you chose to have a child with him\u2019.  There was probably more but at that point I hung up on her. \n\nAfter everything that happened, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m obligated to do more than the minimum (or even the minimum for that matter but I\u2019m too nice) when it comes to him. At no point did I ask my mom to communicate with him, she made that decision herself. Now she\u2019s made he\u2019s stressing her out over this. So am I the asshole for not helping him?\n\nEdit; everyone has mentioned getting my accounts off his bills, I closed the account in question the same day he paid his bill out of it. Every other account I have has been changed or opened after the RO was put in place. I\u2019m well aware that probably wasn\u2019t an accident, he\u2019s always been very manipulative and tried to hide it under stupidity and forgetfulness.", "created_utc": 1674493438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jhfjr/aita_for_not_helping_my_ex_even_though_we_share_a/", "score": 405, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom implying that it\u2019s immature of you to let an able bodied adult handle his own finances after he committed crimes against you and your daughter is emotional abuse.

He's an adult, so let him figure his own life out. You're no longer responsible.", "NTA and I would go to court to get a custody and child support arrangement. You can file yourself and at least get something on paper. \n\nNext, take your name off everything. Transfer accounts to him. Remove his access to important things like utilities. Don\u2019t let him have the ability to mess up your credit rating or accounts because that lasts for a long time.", "NTA.  You have a restraining order against him for a reason.  Get your finances separated from his as quickly as possible.  Call your bank and explain your abusive ex is accessing your accounts so you need to close those and create new ones, they should do this for free especially given the restraining order.  I would speak directly to the loan holder for the car and ask for options given your extenuating circumstances.  It may be worth the credit hit to allow the car to be repossessed rather than pay it or deal with his shit.  There are specific resources for DV survivors to help with financial management and please research what is available in your area  If your Mom csall again tell her you are \"putting your big girl panties on\" by taking care of you and your daughters financial, emotional, and physical health above all else.", "NTA- the only joint responsibility you have now it for the well being of your child. His finances are nothing to do with you now.", "NTA - I would do everything legal I could to separate things from him. Like figure out the car thing through court. He\u2019s able to adult. He\u2019s 32.\n\nThe fact that a. 24yr old was dating on a 19yr old says some things too. He just seems like a shitty person all around.", "NTA, and lock down all of your accounts (change passwords, etc.) to make sure he can't get it. If he has enough personal information on you to open a credit card or take a loan, freeze your credit.\n\nYou have a big liability for co-signing on the loan, hopefully that's the only financial tie.\n\nAs to whether you should \"help\" him? Well, you already know the answer to that - no. It's a waste to try and help someone who will not help himself.\n\nYour mom is out of line, you could use support, not screaming/nagging.", "NTA. I'd cancel all my old accounts and start new ones. You know dang well he didn't accidentally pay his insurance with your info. You made the mistake of co-signing on a car with him and he's using your mom to badger you about a bill he has no intention of paying. Unfortunately, you may take a financial hit and knock to your credit score on this one. I'd tell your mom to block him. If she doesn't, you block her.", "NTA. You\u2019re not in a relationship why would you still have any obligation to pay for anything?! He needs to sort his shit out and learn to live like an adult.", "NTA - You're already doing too much. Cut him off of everything.", "NTA & do not initiate contact as that can sometimes void the restraining order.

Tell your mother to block him if he's stressing her out.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur mom is the AH here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yo are an AH to yourself and crazy to make payments from HIS account.

I was back in Monday and refinanced what was left. That got his name off everything. On the weekend the car was at the bank I went and got my vehicle (that was in his possession).

Or the part where my mom is choosing to continue talking to him despite me never asking her to? I\u2019ve also told her to go ahead and block him if she\u2019s bothered. I understand I have to deal with him in regards to my child but his financial responsibilities are not mine.", "Seriously.

Do nothing for him, and contact the folks about the car loan to find out your options.", "NTA. But you may need to have the car bought back. If he doesn't have it refinanced. Might be what he needs to get the point you're not playing his games. Not your job to pay his bills. If your mom thinks it, is she can do it. Good Luck.", "NTA I have nothing to add that others haven\u2019t said other than stay strong.

I might use that if I talk to her again anytime soon", "He\u2019s never contributed financially. He also likes to say I owe him somewhere around $5000 for the shit he did buy when he lived here. Mainly weed and alcohol, which I\u2019ve quit weed since I don\u2019t feel like I need to be high to get through the day anymore now that he\u2019s gone.
