First I want to say thank you to everyone who commented on my original post and got me to finally open my eyes to how my \"friends\" had been treating me.\n\nI took a couple of days after posting to think of how I wanted to proceed and then I took a chance and texted \"Callie\" and \"Sam\" asking if we could meet up. They agreed and we went to a coffee shop. As soon as I got there, they were both there and were whispering about something and as soon as they saw me, they stopped. In that moment, I realized that's how they've always been, adjoined at the hip, whispering together and stopping when I walk in, never taking me seriously and it was like a switch flipped in that moment. I stopped caring. \n\nAfter getting my coffee, I sat down and we kind of just stared at each other before I finally asked if either of them felt bad about how they treated me. They both seemed surprised and asked how I got to that conclusion. I said that I had had time to think it over and while I felt bad that Callie had been having to dip into her emergency fund, that was not my fault, nor my problem. If anybody's, it was Sam's because she was MOH. I said I had been more than accomodating, changing my hair, getting a specific foundation to cover my tattoos, getting shape wear when it makes me uncomfortable, all of it to make her day amazing. They tried to interject but I just shook my head. I told them that they had been my best friends for a very long time, but probably too long. I went on to list a bunch if times they made me feel like shit which I won't bother you with here but I ended by saying I wouldn't be attending the wedding in any capacity and Callie could pick up the shoes, the dress, the shape wear and the foundation from my mom's house because I was done. They started panicking and tried apologizing but I just got up and asked them to please not talk to me for the foreseeable future and left. \n\nThey both tried to call and text me for days afterwards but I ignored it. I also got a bunch of texts from the other bridesmaids who clearly had not been told the full story and texted all four of the others with the full story. I didn't hear anything back but got a bunch of calls and voicemails from Callie and let's just say they were not nice. I finally texted her and told her her attitude towards all of this just proved my point and that I didn't think we could be friends anymore. \n\nI guess the wedding went on as planned which I guess I'm glad for. And to everyone who was upset about me changing my hair, I'm happy to inform you, it is now neon pink! I think that's it, I'll be moving states with my boyfriend in about a month and I'll be cutting contact with Sam as well so I don't expect anything else will come of any of this. Thank you to every single one of you and I hope the update is what most of you wanted! It's definitely not what I expected but it is what I think needed to happen!", "created_utc": 1693761103, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1692e7t/update_aita_for_not_paying_for_my_friends_eyelash/", "score": 400, "replies": ["#[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vnqcq/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_friends_eyelash/)", "NTA.

I know I'm just a random stranger on the internet, but I am so proud of you! \n\nNTA, of course. :)", "We\u2019re they using you for money in your friendship?", "Girl, yes.", "Good for you!
