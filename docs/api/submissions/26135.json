First I want to say thank you to everyone who commented on my original post and got me to finally open my eyes to how my \"friends\" had been treating me.\n\nI took a couple of days after posting to think of how I wanted to proceed and then I took a chance and texted \"Callie\" and \"Sam\" asking if we could meet up. They agreed and we went to a coffee shop. As soon as I got there, they were both there and were whispering about something and as soon as they saw me, they stopped. In that moment, I realized that's how they've always been, adjoined at the hip, whispering together and stopping when I walk in, never taking me seriously and it was like a switch flipped in that moment. I stopped caring. \n\nAfter getting my coffee, I sat down and we kind of just stared at each other before I finally asked if either of them felt bad about how they treated me. They both seemed surprised and asked how I got to that conclusion. I said that I had had time to think it over and while I felt bad that Callie had been having to dip into her emergency fund, that was not my fault, nor my problem. If anybody's, it was Sam's because she was MOH. I said I had been more than accomodating, changing my hair, getting a specific foundation to cover my tattoos, getting shape wear when it makes me uncomfortable, all of it to make her day amazing. They tried to interject but I just shook my head. I told them that they had been my best friends for a very long time, but probably too long. I went on to list a bunch if times they made me feel like shit which I won't bother you with here but I ended by saying I wouldn't be attending the wedding in any capacity and Callie could pick up the shoes, the dress, the shape wear and the foundation from my mom's house because I was done. They started panicking and tried apologizing but I just got up and asked them to please not talk to me for the foreseeable future and left. \n\nThey both tried to call and text me for days afterwards but I ignored it. I also got a bunch of texts from the other bridesmaids who clearly had not been told the full story and texted all four of the others with the full story. I didn't hear anything back but got a bunch of calls and voicemails from Callie and let's just say they were not nice. I finally texted her and told her her attitude towards all of this just proved my point and that I didn't think we could be friends anymore. \n\nI guess the wedding went on as planned which I guess I'm glad for. And to everyone who was upset about me changing my hair, I'm happy to inform you, it is now neon pink! I think that's it, I'll be moving states with my boyfriend in about a month and I'll be cutting contact with Sam as well so I don't expect anything else will come of any of this. Thank you to every single one of you and I hope the update is what most of you wanted! It's definitely not what I expected but it is what I think needed to happen!", "created_utc": 1693761103, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1692e7t/update_aita_for_not_paying_for_my_friends_eyelash/", "score": 1328, "replies": ["#[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vnqcq/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_friends_eyelash/)", "NTA.

Good luck with the move.", "What\u2019s important here is that you got the message and did something about it.  Neither one gave a damn about you, and both were using you constantly.  Smart move cutting contact, and I hope you\u2019re able to find friends who actually care about someone as kind and caring as you, OP! \ud83d\ude0a", "Thanks for the update! I didn't see the orig post, but always like it when folks come back to update.", "NTA, thanks for the update.", "Well that\u2019s the way you do a proper mic drop! \u2764\ufe0f", "Hopefully your ex friends find out that a wedding is not the same as a marriage.", "WOW  Good for you!", "Wohoo!!! Awesome update! Go you!", "Well done sometimes walking away from a friendship is best for everyone I am in the middle of leaving one myself it's been the hardest time  till I realised I think more of them that they ever did of me it hurt but I am healing slowly good luck for your future", "look at you, with your shiny spine. well done!", "Yes!!! \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f", "Good for you.", "I\u2019m so freakin\u2019 proud of you.  Way to stand up for yourself!  \u2764\ufe0f", "Neon pink hair will go well with that Diamond backbone of yours :)\nGood for you and I hope you have a smooth and easy move and a fantastic life.", "NTA and a lot of people about your age figure out there are some friends they need to fire.", "Honestly, good for you. You seem very strong and confident in your self-worth and life plans here. If you ever get married, you'd never treat your friends like this.", "I'm applauding so much for you right now! I know I'm just a random stranger on the internet, but I am so proud of you! \n\nNTA, of course. :)", "We\u2019re they using you for money in your friendship?", "Girl, yes.", "Good for you!

Strong. Really, really Strong. \n\nSometimes incredible growth just comes from being tread on one time too many. But that\u2019s okay because you\u2019re strong now. Good luck with your move.", "Just read the original post, and tl;dr NTA. As a bridesmaid you don't have to pay for anything for her (though I believe that bridesmaids buy their dresses). What gets me is they want you to change to fit in with their party. If you were my friend, I wouldn't want you to change a thing to help us celebrate. As you said, it's only hair and tats, but I'm thinking it's what makes you you, and she should think the same way. It's only hair and tats, but it's what's inside that she should / is friends with.", "op=NTA\n\nI am an internet stranger who is so glad you took back agency for yourself and chose you over them.\n\nSadly, these unequal friendships often last too long as people normalize them.  \nKeep on respecting yourself and your originality.  Yeah, on the pink Neon(not my color--i'm more in camp blue).\n\nAlways DO YOU!  Good luck on your move.  I hope it opens you to a whole new world of friends and joyful experiences.", "Fabulous update!  Good for you!  You are so NTA!!!", "Hi. I don't know you but am so proud of you!  \nI just watched a video today about what happens when a narcissist pushes an empath too far (I don't know if that applies but it rings true) and the person in the video describes it as a 'phoenix rising from the ashes'. When you're kind and empathetic but finally realised you've been pushed too far, you become utterly galvanised and are just done with the nonsense. The account you shared in the coffee shop is just so satisfying. And it sounds like there was no debating or trying to get them to see it your way, you just were done. That's the key, to not try to change people's mind or make them see things you're way. No, you're just done. It's so great!", "You lost trash and gained a backbone. I'm so happy for you!", "A life lesson, to be sure. Congrats. You won't be fooled again. Good luck, girl!", "I love happy endings!!

I\u2019m sure he saw they were jerks along time ago", "So proud of you! But I also know that it\u2019s hard. I had something similar happen. It was crazy how the light just flipped on and I saw everything differently. Good for you for standing up for yourself. At some point you\u2019ll miss the friendship(s) you thought you had & mourn the old friendship. Just know someone out in the interwebs can relate. It may hurt a little, but you won\u2019t regret it!", "NTA\n\nYour better off without those \u201cfriends\u201d in your life op.", "I may just be a stranger but I am SO proud of you. You showed not only them but yourself that you will not tolerate anyone treating you in such a way.", "She\u2019ll figure it out when the divorce lawyer bill comes", "I would be interested in seeing that video. Are you able to share?", "Strong and content!"]}
