Come Monday morning god and everyone heard about it.", "It\u2019s not like OP stood up and screamed at him. The kid got called out and got upset. They also probably made fun of him because he acted like he took a real shot and it was just mixer. That\u2019s pretty embarrassing, and he did it to himself. It doesn\u2019t matter if \u201ceveryone turns a blind eye\u201d to the drinking. Op specially told him no repeatedly and he dismissed it. \n\nHe also took it upon himself to order a drink on someone else\u2019s tab after being told no. That\u2019s pretty rude to do in any situation. He was only making himself look bad. Maybe he\u2019ll learn and think about his actions in the future.\n\nAnd I would hope the guy in your story got reprimanded for hitting on teenage girls in front of everyone", "I am sure he did, it really sucked for him it was his commanding officers daughter. \n\nLike I said time and place, The Marine Ball is not the time and place to rip someone a new asshole for inappropriate behavior. Come Monday morning all bets are off.", "Oof, I don\u2019t even want to imagine being in his position come that Monday. I bet he had a hard time talking to any girl again after that haha\n\nBut as for OP, that was hardly ripping him a new one. He just basically said \u201clol, you drank soda, kid.\u201d The kid was the one who caused a scene cuz he got embarrassed. It was like a 3 second interaction of the whole night. I doubt anyone paid much attention besides op because he feels bad for some reason and the guy because he was embarrassed, as he should be", "That kid should have been embarrassed. I think the OP handled it well. I know I don\u2019t drink and when my friends want to take shots, I take apple juice shots, or ginger ale shots. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know what happened to that poor kid.
