Saudi Arabia?", "18 years old, he's just a baby! Certainly shouldn't be having any alcohol!

Considering he's now in the marines and is acting like that? Probably for the best he inky got laughed at.

The kid is being an idiot, but he\u2019s an 18 year old kid and you\u2019re an NCO. Are the Marines really letting privates walk around trying to break Regs without a serious talking to? It should have never gotten to the point where you had to fake giving your marine a shot. I know it was the ball and things are more relaxed, but if your marine doesn\u2019t know when to take a hike in a situation like this, I think it says a lot about your leadership. Fix your guy, you have your regulations and a command structure, you\u2019re an NCO. You shouldn\u2019t have to be asking reddit strangers how you should have handled this.", "Yta. Giving someone food/drink under a false pretense is actually a crime. Not only is what you did stupid and obnoxious, it's against the law. You both sound like dummies.", "Fucking hell mate.

You can get away with a lot of shit at the ball because nobody wants to have a bad time. Nobody wants some little PFC at parade rest getting screamed at in front of everyone\u2019s wife, girlfriend, the guest of honor, etc. not to mention they are usually (in my experience) somewhere public, not on base. Like a huge hotel event room.\n\nAll this leads to a lot of relaxed rules, a lot of people pushing the envelope for what they can get away with, because nobody is trying to have a bad night.", "That was my thought exactly! I\u2019m not sure how he made it through basic with that entitlement chip still on his shoulder!! \nRegardless, you knocked it off and hopefully he learned the concept of respect and chain of command!! \nNTA", "Yeah I want to piggy back off of this guy.  I\u2019ve educated Marines many times on the pros and cons, but I know what goes on at the bricks and imo if you\u2019re old enough to serve then you\u2019re old enough to drink.  Problem is that it\u2019s my word vs the federal government and at the end of the day it\u2019s still considered a crime.  \n\nOne day he might even look forward to it and laugh.  Until then he\u2019s just gotta play the game.  \n\nNTA", "There ain't no party like a working party!", "And to add. In my opinion if you are a real team, all in or all out.\n\nSo if some cant drink, none of the team drink. Do that in your own time then.", "The United States???", "Right everyone wants to have fun at the holiday party. \n\nHowever, this guy is new. Just a few weeks in the group and OP probably barely knows him. And what OP does know is that the kid wouldn\u2019t shut up about drinking at the ball even though OP told him no. Whatever people can usually get away with, clearly OP wasn\u2019t down, and the kid pushed it, and also right in front of OPs superiors. The kid could\u2019ve gotten anyone else to get him a drink or pregamed. But he deliberately challenged op, his superior, in front of everyone, which is the main issue here I think, not the drinking", "And none of the under sub 21 year olds were causing a scene but him, because they know their place. I would\u2019ve laughed at him too.", "Yeah every Marine ball I attended everyone was drinking, no matter the age.  And the higher ups didn't care at all.", "For sure, I underage drank at at least 1 ball, but I definitely wasn\u2019t asking my sncos to grab drinks for me.", "The kid could enlist in the Bundeswehr. \ud83d\ude09", "Semper Fidelis? Semper Paratus is the Coasties.", "This backwards motto supports the thinking causing the Dutch National Forces to be a huge fucking Nazinest. Literally like the kids behaviour.", "Then that highlights how backwards the law is if a kid can sooner die in war than have a drink of alcohol.", "I agree, and I\u2019m sure it will be handled promptly on Monday morning. But unless it\u2019s an insanely serious infraction, the ball isn\u2019t the place to deal with it.", "Ive never been in the marines, but from what I understand disrespecting a superior is a pretty serious infraction. OP was even gonna secretly let the kid know that it was fake and let him look cool, but he acted a fool in front of everyone and made OP look bad. It needed to be handled there. \n\nThe kid tried to act tough and got embarrassed. If he doesn\u2019t have the backbone to deal with that he probably shouldn\u2019t be in the marines", "There is a time and place. My father was military, when I was 16 his unit was having a formal dinner that the family attended. There was a young solder that was making a fool of himself with the teenage girls. In fact when I was getting myself my coke to drink he cornered me and I quickly shot him down, my father saw it, there was no scene made it was very quietly handled. Come Monday morning god and everyone heard about it.", "It\u2019s not like OP stood up and screamed at him. The kid got called out and got upset. They also probably made fun of him because he acted like he took a real shot and it was just mixer. That\u2019s pretty embarrassing, and he did it to himself. It doesn\u2019t matter if \u201ceveryone turns a blind eye\u201d to the drinking. Op specially told him no repeatedly and he dismissed it. \n\nHe also took it upon himself to order a drink on someone else\u2019s tab after being told no. That\u2019s pretty rude to do in any situation. He was only making himself look bad. Maybe he\u2019ll learn and think about his actions in the future.\n\nAnd I would hope the guy in your story got reprimanded for hitting on teenage girls in front of everyone", "I am sure he did, it really sucked for him it was his commanding officers daughter. \n\nLike I said time and place, The Marine Ball is not the time and place to rip someone a new asshole for inappropriate behavior. Come Monday morning all bets are off.", "Oof, I don\u2019t even want to imagine being in his position come that Monday. I bet he had a hard time talking to any girl again after that haha\n\nBut as for OP, that was hardly ripping him a new one. He just basically said \u201clol, you drank soda, kid.\u201d The kid was the one who caused a scene cuz he got embarrassed. It was like a 3 second interaction of the whole night. I doubt anyone paid much attention besides op because he feels bad for some reason and the guy because he was embarrassed, as he should be", "That kid should have been embarrassed. I think the OP handled it well. I know I don\u2019t drink and when my friends want to take shots, I take apple juice shots, or ginger ale shots. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know what happened to that poor kid. To me my dad was huge teddy bear.  It I know I was also his daughter."]}
