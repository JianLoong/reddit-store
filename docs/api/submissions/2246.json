Contact your mother. Social media is not the only resource for contacting your mother. \n\nSeems like much is missing - you don\u2019t mention anything about apologizing to your mother when \u201cthey accidentally left off\u201d her name. Of course, she would be hurt by the \u201caccidental\u201d omission.", "Yes a bit YTA. You don't get to contact stangers out of nowhere on the internet ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE KIDS. It's immoral on so many levels. Those people have a life of their own, maybe they didn't know about your mother's past, maybe they are still kids and it's hard for them to process. If anything, you should deal directly with your mom, not her children. Idc that you don't have her telephone number or anything. \n\nI would go as far as saying don't contact your mother again.  Yes, this is the hardest thing to do but you also need to accept that your mother might not want to have a relationship with you. Imo her reasonning behind cutting you off is seems too much for me and it looks like she made you responsible of things that were out of your control since you were a kid. My interpretation is that, in her mind, you sided with your dad and her affair partner. She wasn't good enough for you, she was the poor parent who live in \"small appartment\" while your cheating father lives in \" a big house\" with his affair partner. The wedding thing was the last straw and as retaliation she punished you by cutting off contact. You may think it's unfair and I emphatize with you on this but at the end of the day, this is the life she choose. You need to respect that and cannot force a relationship with her. \n\n \nI know that being rejected is violent, especially when it's your own mother. However keeping contacting her after she told you she doesn't want it is a hopeless quest for you. You will keep running after  love and affection she might not be willing to give you in return. And trust me, the constant rejection will hurt you more than it hurts her.\n\nMy story is a very different from yours since I'm the one who cut contacts with my family after years of physival and mental abuse. I still receive unwanted calls from my former family and I see that as nothing but a violation of my boundaries.  So I clearly see your mother feeling that as well. Just to say that in the end those constant attempts bring nothing good for both parts. Your expectations of building a relationship with your mom will never be met while your mom will see you as someone who constantly breaks her boundaries.", "YTA. You\u2019re almost 30 years old and thought it appropriate to reach out to a child. You are plenty old enough to recognize that your mother was cheated on and then had to watch your father and his affair partner raise her son while she worked her butt off for a \u201ctiny apartment\u201d. This just reads like you were a little shit growing up more happy about what a 2 family household could give you. Then you accept that your wedding invitation just leaves off your mom and you don\u2019t fix it. You wonder why she didn\u2019t support you but maybe she was trying to save you the heartache she went through of being so young and then divorcing. Now you\u2019re complaining how you miss her. Why don\u2019t you think about your moms feelings for once. And now you\u2019ve bothered her underage child and likely brought up lots of questions and emotions that she gets to deal with. For someone that supposedly loves his mom this entire posts reads as you never have.  Lots of information is public and if you truly wanted to find her there are ways.", "YTA", "Don't you think you've hurt that poor woman enough? It also seems doubtful that she was accidentally left off the wedding invites. \n\nAt some point you'd caused her so much pain that she made the tough decision to protect herself from her - at the time - only child. And she seems to be doing well. Be honest, if she hadn't done the same thing you did long before and had a new family that she seemingly  preferred to you, would you even have tried to contact her? Because you had ten years during which you seem to have been fine with her having gone NC.So why are you so intent on getting in touch now that you know she's doing just fine without you?\n\nYTA respect her boundaries", "You messaged a child.

He was (hopefully) an adult when he was sending out wedding invitations.", "Good point about  being a child back then... a child isn't going to understand the betrayal of cheating, nor should they - children should be protected from the mistakes and damage done by adults.\n\nAs OP got older, though, that's when they lose that pass, and no wonder being left off the wedding invitation was the mother's tipping point.", "OP was 19 when he got married.

He treated her as an outsider and wonders why she can\u2019t emotionally have him in her life.", "Mostly he is a shitty human. I hope his wife cheata on him and his kids abandon him like he did his mom.", "I rolled my eyes so hard when OP claimed it was an accident. Like there's no chance OP didn't put dad and stepmom on there bc OP prefers them and just added in the 'there must have been a mistake' once there was a consequence to being shitty", "I'm sure the sibling did not.", "Oh that\u2019s funny (and honestly very cute of you two) that you both missed the misspelling lmao", "Yeah, that's what I thought.", "Likely yes, as by my math OP's mom must have been 19 when she had him.

I wouldn't be pleased about my 19 year old getting married either, regardless of how I felt about the spouse to be. I would certainly recommend caution and taking their time. I'll bet that anything less than full-throated endorsement felt like disapproval to him.", "OP doesn\u2019t say why Mom didn\u2019t approve of the wedding.

He said she wasn't very supportive of them getting married, but contributed as much as she could to the wedding.

Instead you and your wife creeped on a child's social media.", "Take a fucking hint and leave her alone", "Exactly. If you look at the ages, mom had OP when she was 19, divorced by 26 because her husband was cheating, and she was probably just trying to prevent him from the same heartache she went through. OP\u2019s lack of attempt to see his mom\u2019s point of view here is really quite breathtaking.", "Plus, mom still contributed what she could afford to the wedding. So it makes me think she suggested waiting to get married a few years.", "Oh now I know you're an asshole, get off this forum and go live with what you did, leave that woman and her family alone because you sure as hell ain't part of it anymore", "I can\u2019t say this loud enough:  SHE DID NOT SUPPORT IT BECAUSE YOU WERE 19!!!!!

You should have thrown away the invites and had cheap ones printed at an office store to get the message correct", "It would have been so easy to do like theaters do when there\u2019s a cast change- print a simple insert and included the correction there. You screwed up by being so hands off with the wedding that you missed this. It also isn\u2019t cool to talk to a minor like that. But I get wanting to reach out when it was such a mild amount of misunderstanding. I\u2019d hire a PI- knowing the child\u2019s social media will make the work fast. Then send a letter and let it go.

As a kid, sure, maybe you just saw a mom who worked all the time, but as an adult, you should understand she HAD to work all the time to afford that \"tiny apartment\" and you should be **grateful** for the sacrifices she made, not remove the title of \"parent\" from her in favor of the woman who helped give her that single mom status in the first place.\n\nAs for the invitations, you're very vague with the \"they had accidentally left off the third name-my mom.\" Who is the \"they\"? Your wife? Your \"parents\"? At best, your mom was forgotten; at worst, it was intentional. Either was really unforgivable, and the fact that you don't see that makes it really clear why your mom has chosen to love you from afar. I can't imagine someone hurting her more than you did, and I'm sure she needs to keep a distance for her own mental health. You should be ashamed of that.", "I don't know, this whole \"mom disapproved of son's fiancee\" thing really undercuts mom's saintly victim status in this story for me.", "Or they know you're an AH.", "He doesn't say she disapproved of the fiance.

One has a boyfriend I really, really like as a person and as someone who is dating my daughter.\n\n\nIf they come to me today and sat they're getting married, I would be highly concerned and definitely wouldn't support a marriage when they, God willing, have a lot of time ahead of themselves.\n\n\nIt isn't about the guy. It's about the fact they're in their late teens/early twenties and don't have the mental or emotional experience to deal with heavy issues.", "This, I think it\u2019s safe to say getting married at 19 would raise concerns for any parent\u2026", "And she still gave money for the wedding!"]}
