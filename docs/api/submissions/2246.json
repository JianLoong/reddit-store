YTA!", "YTA, you probably hurt her deeply, reading between the lines, she lost everything. Her husband left her for another woman, they lived in the nice house while your mother's standard of living dropped considerably, she had to work hard to afford a shitty apartment, and then her beloved child repeatedly showed a preference for the woman that broke up her marriage. The last straw was when said child left her name off the wedding invitation \"accidentally'.\n\nSo yeah she decided to cut her losses and start afresh , then you show up online, you didn't contact her directly you went to her daughters SM, did it even occur to you to actually go and look for her", "You (and your wife) are TA for involving a child in this. Find some other way to contact your mother if you want back into her life.", "I feel like a big part of the story is missing but you should not have reached out to a child.", "It sounds like your mom went NC and you aren\u2019t respecting that. YTA", "YTA for contacting a minor (who is a stranger to you as you are to her).\n\nyour mother said to not contact her again. do not force contact with her. in her mind, your dad & sm \u201ctook\u201d you away from her and the invitation was final proof of it (no matter how accidental).\n\nyou need to accept that your relationship with your mother is over. if she wants to contact you, she will. \n\n*you cannot force someone to communicate with you if they are unwilling.*", "YTA for abandoning your mother emotionally years ago in favor of your dad and his affair partner. In essence, you dumped your mother the same way your father did.\n\nYTA for allowing those wedding invitations to be sent out without proofreading them and having them corrected. It must have felt like a knife in the heart for your mother to see that.\n\nYTA for assuming that your mother's new family would want anything to do with you.", "YTA \n\nYou tried to reach her through a half sibling you\u2019ve never met, who\u2019s clearly under the age of 10, that was inappropriate.", "YTA - you\u2019re an adult contacting a young child who doesn\u2019t know you. Contact your mother. Social media is not the only resource for contacting your mother. \n\nSeems like much is missing - you don\u2019t mention anything about apologizing to your mother when \u201cthey accidentally left off\u201d her name. Of course, she would be hurt by the \u201caccidental\u201d omission.", "Yes a bit YTA. You don't get to contact stangers out of nowhere on the internet ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE KIDS. It's immoral on so many levels. Those people have a life of their own, maybe they didn't know about your mother's past, maybe they are still kids and it's hard for them to process. If anything, you should deal directly with your mom, not her children. Idc that you don't have her telephone number or anything. \n\nI would go as far as saying don't contact your mother again.  Yes, this is the hardest thing to do but you also need to accept that your mother might not want to have a relationship with you. Imo her reasonning behind cutting you off is seems too much for me and it looks like she made you responsible of things that were out of your control since you were a kid. My interpretation is that, in her mind, you sided with your dad and her affair partner. She wasn't good enough for you, she was the poor parent who live in \"small appartment\" while your cheating father lives in \" a big house\" with his affair partner. The wedding thing was the last straw and as retaliation she punished you by cutting off contact. You may think it's unfair and I emphatize with you on this but at the end of the day, this is the life she choose. You need to respect that and cannot force a relationship with her. \n\n \nI know that being rejected is violent, especially when it's your own mother. However keeping contacting her after she told you she doesn't want it is a hopeless quest for you. You will keep running after  love and affection she might not be willing to give you in return. And trust me, the constant rejection will hurt you more than it hurts her.\n\nMy story is a very different from yours since I'm the one who cut contacts with my family after years of physival and mental abuse. I still receive unwanted calls from my former family and I see that as nothing but a violation of my boundaries.  So I clearly see your mother feeling that as well. Just to say that in the end those constant attempts bring nothing good for both parts. Your expectations of building a relationship with your mom will never be met while your mom will see you as someone who constantly breaks her boundaries.", "YTA. You\u2019re almost 30 years old and thought it appropriate to reach out to a child. You are plenty old enough to recognize that your mother was cheated on and then had to watch your father and his affair partner raise her son while she worked her butt off for a \u201ctiny apartment\u201d. This just reads like you were a little shit growing up more happy about what a 2 family household could give you. Then you accept that your wedding invitation just leaves off your mom and you don\u2019t fix it. You wonder why she didn\u2019t support you but maybe she was trying to save you the heartache she went through of being so young and then divorcing. Now you\u2019re complaining how you miss her. Why don\u2019t you think about your moms feelings for once. And now you\u2019ve bothered her underage child and likely brought up lots of questions and emotions that she gets to deal with. For someone that supposedly loves his mom this entire posts reads as you never have.  Lots of information is public and if you truly wanted to find her there are ways.", "YTA", "Don't you think you've hurt that poor woman enough? It also seems doubtful that she was accidentally left off the wedding invites. \n\nAt some point you'd caused her so much pain that she made the tough decision to protect herself from her - at the time - only child. And she seems to be doing well. Be honest, if she hadn't done the same thing you did long before and had a new family that she seemingly  preferred to you, would you even have tried to contact her? Because you had ten years during which you seem to have been fine with her having gone NC.So why are you so intent on getting in touch now that you know she's doing just fine without you?\n\nYTA respect her boundaries", "You messaged a child. You should try contacting your mom. Perhaps she has been missing you, too. NAH", "NTA, i know from first hand experience that family matters are complicated. I would try to contact her directly, but be prepared for a lot of negativity, she might have moved on and not want to have contact with you :(", "NTA. Others might disagree, but I would persist until I heard the words come out of her mouth myself. Your sister may not have even told her that you reached out. If she does tell you herself after you\u2019ve explained about the invites, I\u2019m assuming she didn\u2019t know it was a mistake, then yeah, leave her be.", "NTA. Your mom was left off the wedding invitations by mistake. You trying to contact her again is understandable - you love her. I don't see why your half-sister has to be so cruel about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You said in a comment that the wedding planner was a friend so there\u2019s a few options that jump to mind about this little \u2018accident\u2019: she\u2019s straight up bad at her job, she\u2019s a bad friend who didn\u2019t know you have a stepmom and a bio mom, or maybe your wife didn\u2019t actually ask her to put your bio mom\u2019s name on the invites. \n\nWith all that background, all the bad blood between them, it really does look like someone made a choice to leave her off the invited. The wedding invitations only had two names on them. Not your mom and dad, which might make sense, but your dad and stepmom. Of course your mom was hurt! Of course it looked like an on purpose snub! You had just actively stood up for your stepmom to your mom and then your mom wasn\u2019t as supportive as your stepmom when it came to the wedding (even though she still gave money towards the wedding). It looked like someone (you!) made the decision to leave her off the invitations because of all that. \n\nAnd now, you and your wife are contacting a literal CHILD via social media?? Leave that little girl alone.\n\nIf it\u2019s so hard for you to find/contact your bio mom maybe take the hint and leave her the hell alone.", "This is what I want to know!

Supported him and helped get into a good career and they had a kid.  Man decided to have an affair, ans marry the affair partner.  Mom got to watch as dad moved to a lovely large home and stepmom got to do all the things mom wanted for herself, including child's love.

My parents gave me some money for the wedding. My mom didn\u2019t support it but gave what she could.", "Then it\u2019s clear your mom doesn\u2019t want any more contact with you. She gave her friends clear instructions not to give out her info.", "Could you give them a letter to pass along to your mom?", "Hire a private detective if you are set on finding her. I wish you luck.", "NTA do those friends know that the wedding invitation thing was a huge mistake that you regret?? Do they understand how much you love and miss your Mom?", "Then if it was free you could afford it. Even if it wasn't free the printer should have fixed their mistake at no charge.", "I would if I could afford it.", "They find it funny. They\u2019re not very nice women.", "You don't need a private detective. If you know her full name and prior cities she's lived in you can find anyone just by googling them.
