Social media is not the only resource for contacting your mother. \n\nSeems like much is missing - you don\u2019t mention anything about apologizing to your mother when \u201cthey accidentally left off\u201d her name. Of course, she would be hurt by the \u201caccidental\u201d omission.", "Yes a bit YTA. You don't get to contact stangers out of nowhere on the internet ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE KIDS. It's immoral on so many levels. Those people have a life of their own, maybe they didn't know about your mother's past, maybe they are still kids and it's hard for them to process. If anything, you should deal directly with your mom, not her children. Idc that you don't have her telephone number or anything. \n\nI would go as far as saying don't contact your mother again.  Yes, this is the hardest thing to do but you also need to accept that your mother might not want to have a relationship with you. Imo her reasonning behind cutting you off is seems too much for me and it looks like she made you responsible of things that were out of your control since you were a kid. My interpretation is that, in her mind, you sided with your dad and her affair partner. She wasn't good enough for you, she was the poor parent who live in \"small appartment\" while your cheating father lives in \" a big house\" with his affair partner. The wedding thing was the last straw and as retaliation she punished you by cutting off contact. You may think it's unfair and I emphatize with you on this but at the end of the day, this is the life she choose. You need to respect that and cannot force a relationship with her. \n\n \nI know that being rejected is violent, especially when it's your own mother. However keeping contacting her after she told you she doesn't want it is a hopeless quest for you. You will keep running after  love and affection she might not be willing to give you in return. And trust me, the constant rejection will hurt you more than it hurts her.\n\nMy story is a very different from yours since I'm the one who cut contacts with my family after years of physival and mental abuse. I still receive unwanted calls from my former family and I see that as nothing but a violation of my boundaries.  So I clearly see your mother feeling that as well. Just to say that in the end those constant attempts bring nothing good for both parts. Your expectations of building a relationship with your mom will never be met while your mom will see you as someone who constantly breaks her boundaries.", "YTA. You\u2019re almost 30 years old and thought it appropriate to reach out to a child. You are plenty old enough to recognize that your mother was cheated on and then had to watch your father and his affair partner raise her son while she worked her butt off for a \u201ctiny apartment\u201d. This just reads like you were a little shit growing up more happy about what a 2 family household could give you. Then you accept that your wedding invitation just leaves off your mom and you don\u2019t fix it. You wonder why she didn\u2019t support you but maybe she was trying to save you the heartache she went through of being so young and then divorcing. Now you\u2019re complaining how you miss her. Why don\u2019t you think about your moms feelings for once. And now you\u2019ve bothered her underage child and likely brought up lots of questions and emotions that she gets to deal with. For someone that supposedly loves his mom this entire posts reads as you never have.  Lots of information is public and if you truly wanted to find her there are ways.", "YTA", "Don't you think you've hurt that poor woman enough? It also seems doubtful that she was accidentally left off the wedding invites. \n\nAt some point you'd caused her so much pain that she made the tough decision to protect herself from her - at the time - only child. And she seems to be doing well. Be honest, if she hadn't done the same thing you did long before and had a new family that she seemingly  preferred to you, would you even have tried to contact her? Because you had ten years during which you seem to have been fine with her having gone NC.So why are you so intent on getting in touch now that you know she's doing just fine without you?\n\nYTA respect her boundaries", "You messaged a child.

She was left by your dad and you embraced and probably treated your step moms better than her. \n\nYou favored your stepmoms for your wedding invite, cause you can't tell me that you didn't see those invites before they went out, hurting your moms even more.\n\nI think the wedding invite was the last straw that showed her you didn't really love her as your dad or stepmom. So while I feel for you  and don't think you are an AH for trying to reach her via your half sister, you would be an AH if you try to reach her again, against her wishes.", "YTA. You dumped your MOTHER, just like your dad. \n\nYou broke her heart. You didn\u2019t give a damn. \n\nLeave her alone.", "YTA for everything you did to that woman. Leave her alone, it's too little too late", "YTA, you \"accidentally\" left your mom off the wedding invitations but sent them out anyway? Then ten years later attempt to contact your mom through a child? If you want to contact your mom you need to contact her, not her child.", "YTA One thing for sure is you should have never reached out to your Bio Mom through her child. The half sibling should never have been involved. You don't use children to be the go between for your adult issues.", "Info when she called you about the invites did you apologize? You never answer this when people ask. You say you guys had a fight, so did you blow off her feelings and make it seem like it was no big deal it happened and she should just get over it?", "YTA...you have a to accept the consequences of your actions. You were a pretty awful person to your mom. Dont make it anyone else's problem now.", "YTA. I feel like there\u2019s some missing information here. For the vast majority of moms, cutting all contact and just disappearing out of your child\u2019s life is NEVER an option. So I guess what my question is\u2026what the hell happened over how many years before she came to this kind of painful and nuclear decision?! Because saying you\u2019re two different people and have never been close is fine, and I know Reddit loves to tell people to go NC for any and no reason at all, but I guarantee this didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum.", "So I have to say YTA for contacting an unknown child online. I know you didn't think about it like that, and just wanted to speak to your mom again, but it's not okay. \n\nFor actually trying to contact your mom, I am more conflicted. I don't think children should have to pick sides in conflicts between parents. And you aren't necessarily to blame for preferring one situation to another. I think not recognising everything she did for you was a mistake, but a human one. Seems like you do get it now. \n\nWanting your mom is not wrong. Even the people I know with some of the most toxic families still miss their moms from time to time. It's not a failing on your part to want or miss her.\n\nWith that compassion in mind, the fact stands that you are not a child anymore. \n\nYou don't have a right to be part of anyone's life, nor the right to stalk or harrass them/members of their family. Further contact with her children is absolutely wrong. \n\nIf you want to reach out to her properly, it cannot be a demand. You send one letter or email saying you recognise what you did was wrong, you are sorry, and the door is open on your end should she ever wish to connect in the future.\n\nBut you have to respect a no. And never attempt more contact unless she instigates. As adults, we have to parent ourselves.", "YTA", "Wow. YTA", "Info So, why did your mom disapprove of the wedding? Is it an inappropriate age gap or whatnot?", "YTA and I\u2019m glad your mom actually has a real family now. Stay dead to her, you\u2019re not worth it.", "YTA. You do not put kids in the middle of your mess. At 19, you made an adult decision, and it cost you more than you were able to grasp.\n\nThe reality is no one is promised tomorrow with that person, be it life or death. This includes parents. Not all parents wait for you to grow up. You showed your mom that you didn\u2019t care, and she moved on. She started a new life, a new family. \n\nLet her go.", "YTA you literally abandoned your mother in favour of your dad and his affair partner and years later you realise you miss your mom? You are awful and don\u2019t deserve any of her time. \nShe\u2019s created a new family after you ditched her like she was nothing but dirt under your shoe, you made your bed so lie in it. \nGo get comfort from your dad and his affair partner you love so much.", "YTA. Your whole life you chose your cheating father and his affair partner over your own mother. You\u2019re getting EXACTLY what you deserve.", "YTA - did it ever occur to you that your mom was working all the time to support you and keep that \u201ctiny apartment\u201d so you would have a safe place to be, while your dad moved on and played happy families with his new wife in the house? \nAnd then messaging a child about your mom. You should have found moms account and messaged her directly rather than dragging innocent kids into things.", "NTA for wanting to contact your mum. It was 10 years ago, and she may have had the same feelings towards you as you have had towards her over the year. I think you should try to contact your mother directly and let her tell you directly if she doesn't want to speak to you. I am sure there are ways of sending her a message or letter, but be prepared that it might not be plain sailing and your half sibling may not have told your mum you were trying to contact her. Clearly they are very young, under 10, and I would not contact them again directly.", "NTA. Time had gone by and you missed your Mom. You tried to mend the relationship and apparently your Mom felt the need to talk terribly about you to her new family. I wouldn\u2019t try again, though.", "NTA as long as you dont bother them.\n\nYou have the right to look for her, she has the right to ignore you", "NTA if your mom decided to peace out of your relationship that's on her. I understand your need to connect now but you're likely better off without her. Any parent who will abandon their kid isn't actually a parent, just a biological connection.", "NTA. At all.", "You\u2019re not an A for trying to reconnect with your mother, but just know that if there\u2019s any chance of that happening, it\u2019ll have to start with A LOT of apologizing on your part. And even then, your mother would be completely justified in saying no after what has occurred. So keep that in mind with whatever you do.", "I feel  sorry for his mom that poor lady.", "Yup. OP replaced her and now he\u2019s getting to know what that feels like and he can\u2019t handle it.\nI love how he mentions that dad and stepmom don\u2019t know why he looked for mom. They\u2019re surprised because they thought they\u2019d \u201cwon\u201d and their egos are also bruised. OP, maybe they aren\u2019t the wonderful people you thought they were.\n\nAnd yes, YTA. Big time.", "I'm gonna guess it never occurred to him - since it wasn't even him who found his half-sibling but his fiancee?  He was happily living a life without his mother in it and didn't care at all.  Says he missed her but never even tried at all to reach out for a decade.  I want to give so many YTA here it's crazy.  I can't imagine doing that to either of my parents after their divorce.", "OP replied in another comment that his mom used to police his social media so odds are she\u2019s policing his half sister\u2019s and this was her response directly.", "In another comment (that got downvoted) OP said that his mom used to police his SM so odds are she\u2019s police\u2019s the half sister and the response was direct from mom.", "This poor woman has went and built a new life for herself and now has to worry about OP reaching out to her children who are under the age of 10. I\u2019m sure OP\u2019s mom knows he has children and if she didn\u2019t reach out when those babies were born, she\u2019s never going to.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of missing reasons here and the invitations were just the final straw. OP followed in his fathers footsteps of betrayal.", "I read my wedding invites at least a dozen times before they were printed and at least a half dozen after they were printed and before they went out. I cannot imagine not checking to make sure.", ">I know that being rejected is violent, especially\n\n...when it's your own child, repeatedly for years.\n\n\n He might have been young then, but he's an adult now and has shown absolutely 0 self reflection about how shitty his stepmom and dad were and frankly, still are", "You are not crazy. In addition to the MIL/DIL troll, there\u2019s also a step-parents troll. It comes in several variations and this seems to be todays.", "But he already did hear the words come out of her mouth\u2026she told him she wasn\u2019t coming to the wedding and to never contact her again. She told him very clearly to leave her alone 10 years ago and has so far stuck to her boundary and not had any contact with him.\n\nWhat about that situation would make him or his wife think it was ok to message a child neither of them knows?", "He said he had already told her about the so-called mistake. She didn't believe his story then, so what makes you think it would be even more believable now? Do you honestly think harrassing her minor children would be the smartest way to get her to believe him? He needs to leave her alone and be satisfied with his dad and stepmother. After all, they were good enough for him when they were buying his love all those years while she struggled.", "Exactly this. Apparently the wife\u2019s friend made the invitation - the wife that mom didn\u2019t approve of. Makes me wonder if it was a mistake and if Mom was actually the problem in terms of the conflict.", "What a load of crap. You're telling me nobody checked the invites? Not you, your wife or your planner? Nobody spent 10 seconds to go \"I wonder what the invites look like\"? The printers didn't check either? Forget your mother, did you even care about your own wedding?", "BS that stuff gets looked over before it's printed. Someone had to have seen a proof before the final printing. This sounds like a lie made up to cover your rear when you realized this was a bridge too far.", "And when you were trying to get her to \u201chear you out\u201d, did your words include an apology????", "Dude, your stepmother did that on purpose. No one \u201cforgets\u201d a parent.", "Oh please, it's so much easier to find people now. You don't need a PI. You can contact an adult relative. YTA", "So you brought a minor into a situation they have no place in. You went from being a shitty son to also a shitty sibling.", "OMG, just own your mistake already!!! YTA. It will ALWAYS be YTA. You abandoned your mom and excluded her from your wedding, you consistently chose your father's affair partner over your own Mother. You F*ck*d up, own it!", "You need to find out from your wife why your mom wasn't on the wedding invitations, but now your wife has decided to try and spy on your mom through your step sister.\n\nThis is very suspicious behavior imo", "You found your mom in a social media post about Mother\u2019s Day\u2026 you found her because she was tagged in it and your WIFE reached out to your much younger minor sister instead of your mom.", "Yeah I agree that given his comments self reflection ain't OP's forte. On a second read, it feels like OP looked down on his mother for working her ass off and being poor while father and mistress were the cool parents and richer ones. I also tend to think that the invitation shit-show might be orchestred by the father +wife. So yeah I completely get why the mother had enough and tried to build a better life for herself with a more loving support system. OP should absolutely respect that. Adult relationship are not owed they are earned.", "Maybe take a step out of your own playbook. Allow your mom to be happy with her new family like you were when you chose your dad and the woman he cheated with because they had nicer things. Of course stepmom knew you probably weren\u2019t close dad had told her this and she swooped in out of jealousy and guilt. She stole your moms husband and son!", "So you chose to let your now wife dictate the wedding invitations. Cute", "I can attest to that. The draft for mine had to redone twice.", "Worse, he is a shitty, cowardly son and sibling. He outsourced the task to his wife. Coward. And YTA", "If this is true then you already know that the person replying was your mom so just leave her alone.", "Still no excuse. I would be LIVID. Why is your wife stirring the pot contacting your half sister?", "Do you have enough money to buy a clue? She doesn't want you in her life after the billshit you put hervthrough.

Leave her alone.", "So take this as she was seriously hurt and damaged by you and your father betrayal", "Agree, if the reply wasn\u2019t mom the blocking was.", "> She forgot to put my mom on there.\n\nWho signed off on the proof that got sent to the printers then?

YTA.**  As a single mother, she was working hard to provide for you. You stabbed her through the heart with the wedding invitations, and probably, in many other ways.  That was just the last straw for her. Though she may not have supported you 100% about the marriage, she gave you money to help out.\n\nYou, the bride, your father/stepmother, wedding planner could have all double checked those invitations. Besides font, paper type, etc., I'm pretty sure the printer asked what names to put on those invitations. Usually, printers write everything down and have you sign that what was printed was at your approval. I truly believe you or someone in \"your\" family left her name off purposefully.\n\nYour mother also waited to remarry until you were older. Your father was messing around during his marriage to your mother. You wait TEN years to try to contact your mother.  \n\nI truly hope that your mother is happy in every way possible.

Puzzle pieces are adding up.", "Willing to bet money your wife purposely left her off.", "YTA- You just said \u201cmy parents\u201d gave me some money for the wedding\u2026 your Mom is one of your parents and she was completely omitted.

What sort of mistake that ISN\u2019T part of the instructions given to the printer would involve OP needing to pay for a second set of instructions?", "Don't forget his wife", "Ignore this. You and your father caused her enough trauma. Let her heal with her family that actually loves and cares about her.", "Don\u2019t.

Your mom was right. Glad she got away from all of you", "Your wife doesn\u2019t sound very nice either. Her friend did the invitations. You honestly think the omission was an accident if your wife had more influence than you? You implied she and your mom did not get on.

The mystery of why your mom disapproved is deepening. \ud83d\ude44. Did she remind you of your homewrecking stepmom? I\u2019m guessing as neither respect boundaries. After being associated with those two, it\u2019s rich you would say mom\u2019s friends are \u201cnot nice women\u201d. They are protecting their friend and find the fact that she won in the end hilarious. The ones you stay close to don\u2019t sound that great.\nAnd dude, NEVER actually stand up for the affair partner to the cheated party. Leave it at \u201cI don\u2019t want to be involved\u201d or \u201ccan you not say those things around me. It makes me uncomfortable\u201d.
