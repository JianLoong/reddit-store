I tracked down her dads email address in her contacts list", "YTA, nosy, ridiculous arsehole. \"...they honestly didn't sit well with me\". This wasn't about you, but since your head is so up far into your rear orifice, you couldn't see it. The only good outcome I see about this is that you've shown your \u2014i hope\u2014 soon to be ex-fianc\u00e9 who you really are.", "Yes, spouses who contact in laws behind their spouse's back are nearly always the AH. And in this case in particular. She cut him out of her life. This wasn't unique information you had that he couldn't easily get himself. You really overstepped.", "YTA. What the fuck, dude?", "YTA- her reasons do not need to sit well with you. They are her reasons, and I hope this causes so much trouble in your relationship. Because you have no respect for her", "YTA, there's no way you're not. He didn't deserve shit, if he cared so much, he could have purchased one himself.", "YTA. You overstepped. If he really wanted to know he could have done the test. Glad he's happy but you broke the trust of your SO.", "YTA, and honestly, I hope she sees this as the red flag it is. You\u2019ve decided that if you disagree with her about things that are entirely not your business, you\u2019ll go behind her back and do what you want, regardless of what she wants.", "Her dad could have done his own test if he wanted to know that info. You don't go behind your partner's back like that. \n\nYTA.", "YTA and have damaged her trust in you.", "YTA. Way over stepping multiple boundaries.", "YTA and a HUGE one. It wasn\u2019t your information to give out. What if there was abuse you don\u2019t know about? What if others did not want to be found? Instead you waved a GIANT red flag.", "YTA for ignoring her wishes; going behind her back; and causing a lack of trust in your relationship. You did everything wrong here. You don't know her history with him - only what she chooses to share. It might have been a horrible childhood, and you brought it all back by contacting him without telling her. That is one of the biggest trust violations there is. You need to beg for forgiveness, but I'm doubting you'll get it.", "YTA. It was not your place to do this and I\u2019m shocked you think this was okay", "Well you essentially went against what you agreed to and hid it from her. To me, that\u2019s as good as lying. And it wasn\u2019t even about your own family relationships, but HER family relationships where her opinion should have been paramount. YTA", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not what you did, it\u2019s HOW you did it. Why did you feel the need to force the results on him? Also, you need to let your fianc\u00e9 know ahead and what she thinks. This isn\u2019t your role. You are overstepping. \n\nWhy not simply explain how you are doing a 23 and me test and may learn information, the ASK if he would like to know them?

I thought I was going to go differently with this one because this is something I feel strongly about but I feel much more strongly about boundaries and consent and communication, and you clearly demonstrated you don't understand or do any of it.

I can't figure out one reason it would benifit you.", "YTA it wasn't your place", "YTA. You completely went against what your girlfriend wanted and went behind her back to do it. That\u2019s basically the same thing as lying. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sit well with me\u201d instead of having another conversation about it, even though it\u2019s not about what you want here, you snuck behind her back. Of course she livid with you. Your broke her trust.", "YTA\n\nHe could have done his own genetic testing at any time and you had no right whatsoever to engage with him at all. That's her business.  She cut him off a decade ago.  It was incredibly wrong of you to go behind her back and involve him in any facet of her life.  His status as an adoptee isn't relevant.  \n\nIF she goes through with marrying you, please remember that notifying him of any milestones is at HER discretion and you don't get a vote.", "YTA. You majorly overstepped boundaries because of *your* personal hang ups. This is not how relationships are supposed to run. And you\u2019re *thirty five* doing this?", "YTA, enough said.", "Good luck friend, because this doesn't sit well for your future relationship at all.", "Are you serious? Spare your girlfriend the trouble and leave asshole", "WOW! You overstepped so many boundaries it's almost unbelievable. As someone who is adopted, had you done this to me, you would have immediately become my EX-fianc\u00e9!\n\nYTA!!!!!", "Yta. Wtf. Why do you think your reasons are better than hers?", "YTA. I hope you are her ex fianc\u00e9 if she has any sense.", "YTA You stepped over boundaries. That wasn't your call. If her father wanted to know about his bio family he would have done the research himself. There's something called minding your own business. You might try it.", "YTA. Shame on you! You made it clear that you didn't give a crap about her feelings. You're projecting; because you went through a difficult time with your siblings you projected your problems on your fiancee's situation. You decided her reasons for not talking to her dad meant nothing to you because all that mattered was what you wanted. You're very selfish. I hope that your fiancee sees this as a sign that she shouldn't marry you.", "You did something good for her father and the only bad done were some bruised egos. NTA for me.", "My adopted half brother was found through 23 and me so I think it's a fantastic thing and I'm a little torn on this one.\n\nOn one hand I think that her dad finding his bio family is a good thing and a brilliant result for some awful behaviour on you and your wife's part. \n\nOn the other hand the way you did it was awful. I think you did a good thing in an asshole way.\n\nPersonally I think your wife should have told her bio dad this info and her not doing this was a really shit thing to do. \n\nSo, ESH I suppose.", "NTA you did what you felt was right", "ESH. You did something behind her back and that\u2019s not okay. No idea why she has a fractured relationship with her dad but she sucks too for not sharing the information. She didn\u2019t have to have some big relationship change to send a simple letter with the information she found through the 23 and me.", "NTA", "This was wrong, but I don\u2019t wanna call you an asshole because I feel that you were doing something you felt was good at the time. But I am gonna tell you that you had no right to do it without making sure your fianc\u00e9 was okay with it first. You guys have a shared life together now but you extended yourself too far into her own personal life for it to be justified.\n\nour relationships with our parents are kind of inflicted on us when we\u2019re kids but when we\u2019re old enough, we finally cross that point where we get to choose what we do with our personal relationships and it seemed she didn\u2019t feel he deserved much of a place in her life now as an adult, at least that intimately. \n\nThat is something that you didn\u2019t need to understand, just needed to respect. Which you didn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t sit well with you because of your own personal past. But you should not have projected your own personal experiences onto her like that. \n\nthat being said, what you actually did came from a good place and I think you guys could heal from it. I would expect serious trust issues in your relationship going forward, that\u2019s the biggest thing you have to work on. Either way, I would make this the last time you cross over too much into her own personal/family life. \n\nBut yea, honesty and communication.
