Even though my wife knows that she has diabetes she doesn\u2019t seem to care at all that she has diabetes. She has been on a strict medication that her doctor has set her which has been some foods and she\u2019s not allowed to eat fried/sugary stuff as this will raise her sugar levels. \n\nYesterday i went to the the shop and she came with me and i bought what we needed to get and she just followed along with me. As we are at the till she says that she needs to go to the toilet and will meet me outside. When i\u2019m done with paying i go outside only to see my wife opening a packet of haribos which the doctor says she\u2019s not allowed to eat.\n\nI quickly run over before she open it and i grab it out of her hand and throw it in the bin. She starts getting angry saying that i\u2019m a bitch and a overprotective motherfucker and she starts crying almost saying how it\u2019s not fair how she\u2019s not allowed to eat sweets. I tell her to stop and say that i cannot let her eat that.\n\nShe grabs my keys for my car and she drives away leaving me at the shop. I call her over and over and she doesn\u2019t pick up. I\u2019m absolutely furious at her and start walking home. As soon as i\u2019m home i see her eating fried food on the sofa and i grab the food out of her hand saying that you cannot eat that. I also yell at her saying that she\u2019s selfish leaving me at the shop like that. She doesn\u2019t care and picks up the food and shoves it at my face and calls me a prick and leaves the house. I don\u2019t know where she is and not sure if i\u2019m the asshole. I love her a lot and i cant let her eat those types of foods as it\u2019s bad for her. AITA?\n\nEDIT- She came home after about an hour and said she was sorry and that i\u2019m being overprotective and says that she\u2019s knows what she\u2019s doing and i\u2019m being an asshole for not letting her do what she wants.\n\nEDIT 2- Shes got a 10.1 A1C and shes taking metformin everyday. The only problem is that according to some people that\u2019s too high for metformin and now has me wondering if she was lying to me as she goes to the doctors on her own and doesn\u2019t want me to come with her.", "created_utc": 1676927125, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117ki89/aita_for_not_letting_my_wife_eat_what_she_wants_to/", "score": 2735, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We can't have it constantly as others without diabetes can, but we can treat ourselves with treats and enjoy life without cutting out food that we love all the time. I definitely had a at first issue cutting down on sweets when I first got diagnosed, but with a good between with exercise, appointments with my doctor's/endocrinologist to keep track of my sugars along with testing with my CGM, it is okay to have your sweets as long as you keep in moderation/portions and with me plan ahead with my insulin.\n\nYTA, and you are VERY uninformed of how to go about this. Do more research, join diabetic groups and talk to those who ARE diabetic and how they balance eating unhealthy foods they like and keeping their sugars under control and then go to your wife with these ideas in mind.

Sadly, you cannot help someone that refuses to help themselves.", "YTA. She's your wife, not your kid. I understand you want the best for her, but that's HER decision to make, not yours. If she continues eating against her doctor's orders and he finds out or her bloodwork comes back bad, maybe she'll change how she eats. Until then, it's not your job to treat her like that.

You\u2019re heart is in the right place of wanting to help her and as someone who has T2D and has watched loved ones struggle with T2D it\u2019s commendable that you want to \u201csave\u201d her. You can\u2019t control her though. She knows what she can and can\u2019t eat. She knows what she should do but isn\u2019t doing it. T2D is a struggle. Sugar can be just as strong of an addiction as anything else. Instead of going all dictator on her and scolding her like a child and throwing away her food, why not sit down and have a serious conversation with her, apologize and then talk about how you want her around to grow old with and if she doesn\u2019t take care of herself that can\u2019t happen. Offer to get her some sugar free candies and make a plan for \u201csplurge\u201d meals once a month that she can look forward to (and make it a date to help her feel even more special).

Skip a workout, watch TV instead of clean, etc.\n\nHonestly, it's not your business what she eats. Maybe you guys can have a discussion and advocate for a treat once or twice a week, maybe you can help her find healthy alternatives and switch to fruit over processed sugar, but you're definitely overstepping and ruining your relationship. \n\nThat being said, she shouldn't have left you at the shop.", "YTA\n\nType 2 diabetes for about 4 years now.\n\nSometimes, yes, I do eat candy. You try and take ANY food out of my hands? I'm done with you xD", "YTA for being controlling but I understand why you did that.\n\nHow long has it been since your wife was diagnosed? If it is recent she needs to take some time to adjust. This is a major lifestyle change and it isn\u2019t easy. Aside from the dietary changes she has to get used to monitoring her blood sugar and learning the signs of being too high or low. \n\nIf my husband snatched food away from me, I\u2019d go and eat more of something forbidden in defiance. It sounds like your wife and I have similar personalities! So don\u2019t police her. When things are calmer, talk to her about how you can support her. At a minimum, at least to start, that means you don\u2019t eat sweets or scarf carbs in front of her. Perhaps meet with a dietician to help come up with meal plans. Just remember this is a big thing to have to adjust to.\n\nAlso if you are drinkers, be aware of the carbs and sugars lurking in beer, wine, and cocktails.\n\nPoorly controlled diabetes eventually leads to cardiovascular issues, neuropathy, poor circulation, eye issues, among other things. My husband, ironically a doctor who was very strict with his diabetic patients, failed to control his diabetes until he had his first stents placed 12 years ago. He has since had a stroke, has neuropathy that makes it nearly impossible for him to walk, his vagus nerve is affected so he has a bladder stimulator and gastrointestinal issues, and cerebral vascular disease/dementia, among other things. He\u2019s in his early 70s and is doing fairly well despite it all but he will continue to decline. The damage was done long ago. So when you can have a discussion with your wife, tell her you don\u2019t want to see her go through things like this, and do your best to support her.", "YTA. I was going to go ESH but you repeatedly took food out of her hand that super sucks. I get that you\u2019re worried but this isn\u2019t the way. It\u2019s extremely difficult to change your entire lifestyle and sweets and/or fried foods can be had occasionally (my mom has diabetes and is very healthy eating certain foods in moderation). Someone else recommended an appointment with a dietician and I think that\u2019s the best idea for you guys. You need to get familiar with the limits so your wife can be healthier without making her feel like she needs to completely go without foods that make her happy", "YTA, but ONLY for the part about snatching food out of her hands. That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nI have watched my grandma bend over backwards to try to manage my grandpa\u2019s weight and diabetes, and he just doesn\u2019t take care of himself.

Just what your wife needs, on tip of a disease with no cure is to be policed on every decision she makes.\n\nIt is brutal to be diabetic.  There is no cure, only treatment. Then there is the abuse by medical professionals who think it is a moral issue and not a medical one.\n\nEventually there is insulin. And fighting to keep the sugar on the numbers with that is an utter joy. How do I know? I am diabetic.  \n\nThere are diabetic educators, nutritionists, and others who can help your wife. What you did was cruel. What if she was having a sugar low?", "You can't force her to accept the realities of her condition.  I went undiagnosed with type 2 diabetes for God knows how long because I didn't want to accept it, but my family members knew that nagging me would make me resist more.

Do you honestly think snatching food out of her hands is going to help the situation?", "YTA, there is ways to handle this type of situation.  Figure out why she needed to eat those candies and why in secret.  Watch her levels through out the day to make sure she is okay.   Talk to a nutritionists to figure out how to get her off sugar.  I believe there are sugar free gummies out there.  Help her find alternative foods that will help her cravings.  Sugar can be addictive and very difficult to stop.

There are a lot of ways for type 2 diabetics to control their sugar intake. And honestly a good doctor will tell you you need to watch carbohydrates. There is no reason she can't have a snack as long as she compensates her insulin for that and does the exercises for that. But at the end of the day this is her body, her health, and her life.

Would OP have had the same reaction if she ate a plain baked potato instead? No, which is just as impactful as eating sugar would be to a diabetic. OP needs to go look at a glycemic index chart. \n\nGlucose: 100\nSucrose (table sugar): 65\nBread: 75\nPotatoes: 75-90\nWhite rice:73\nCorn Flakes cereal: 81\n\nYes, a bowl of corn flakes for breakfast is SIGNIFICANTLY more impactful than table sugar to blood glucose levels to a diabetic. What is she eating at home that OP approves of? Guarantee it's lots of things off the high glycemic index list.\n\nI'm a T2 and my last A1C was 6.1 from a high of 11.8. My fasting glucose is under 90. I've lost 130lbs since my diagnosis. Guess what? I still eat carbs! Potatoes, rice, corn (bread too until I went GF). Even candy and GF cookies sometimes! Controlling diabetes isn't just \"don't eat sugar\". Clearly OP hasn't even taken the time to try to understand his partner's disease. Is his partner doing what they need to do so they can safely enjoy carbs on occasion? No clue because OP hasn't taken the time to find out and tell us. Maybe if she was insulin dependent (T1 or T2) and knew her sugars were high and still was eating gummy bears, that might warrant such a heavy handed response (because there is a real risk of diabetic coma and other immediate health risks). But a T2 on oral meds isn't going to immediately die if they eat a few grams of sugar (the risk is long term damage). \n\nBoth need to sit down together with her doctor and a nutritionist, and likely a therapist as well. Diabetes is a serious disease, but it can be managed without resorting to humiliating those we care about.

I only go over 1/3 of the RDA when I'm having a special treat, such as a slice of cake on one of my kids' birthdays, or going out for fish and chips with my husband for a date. That's less than once a month.

It wasn't easy, and it will probably never be easy, but I have children who need me and a life that I want to live. Preferably a long and active one. Tasty foods are hard to give up, but not as hard as the extra years I might have if I can do this right. \n\nI'm really sorry for your loss.

It's pathetic", "But there's the roughly 1 day span after when you're exhausted and the day before when you're swollen and hurting again, leaving usually one day between sessions to feel slightly normal", "Because his behavior was totally unacceptable. If I saw him do that, I\u2019d intervene to make sure she was safe, and provide domestic violence resources.", "Because he is - you cannot grab food out of adult persons hands - this dynamic has seriously morphed into toxic and safety issues for the wife - monitoring and controlling food is abuse", "Oh I meant it can be one pack to have an impact on physiology, but given her deceptive food based behaviors, there's probably an underlying pattern here where she isn't trying. Op didn't get upset because it was one pack today, he's probably seeing her self sabotage constantly", "Yea I totally get it. I mean fuck me I was going to walk into traffic the other day but my wife held me back. What a controlling asshole, am I rite?", "There\u2019s no guarantee that he\u2019s going to wind up taking care of her and the opposite could be true - life can be quite ironic from time to time - what if he gets sick or injured and she winds up caring for him -he is totally approaching with with a seriously toxic mindset that\u2019s causing stress and her to not feel comfortable to work on her health", "He can leave, if he is so incensed that he can\u2019t stop himself from putting his hands on her. And so could you. You don\u2019t get to dominate your spouse with your will. Everyone gets to make their own choices.", "Congrats on 5 years!  That's a big deal!", "My brother's was over 700 when he was diagnosed.  I didn't even know THAT was possible.", "Or, perhaps she's reacting to him being seriously controlling.", "High blood sugar can cause inflammation and vascular issues.... which can lead to a whole host of problems.", "Diabetics are vulnerable to any flesh wound, because their healing is very slow and infection easily sets in.", "i am the diabetes police for my dad only because his blood sugar hits up to 300 at the highest cause he decides a doctor pepper, cigarettes and monsters are viable food to go on before actually eating a real meal\n\ni wish he'd at least cut one of these things out of his diet and i'd let him have them, preferably the cigs but hey no matter how much we warn him or tell him including the doctor he won't listen so it's just kind of \"i guess!\" we at least try to limit his monster intake to ONE \n\nman is going to outlive god himself just so he can have another dr pepper ~~the wrong choice of soda obviously coke and cherry coke are superior lol~~", "I was going to say, the only thing that came to mind was the size of the bag. I know someone diabetic who still eats the giant family bags and complains that her diabetes isn\u2019t under control yet but equally I know someone that would buy one of those tiny packs as a treat occasionally and only if her sugars allowed", "YTA\n\nYour wife is an adult with a long term health condition that is her responsibility to manage. You are her partner (allegedly) not her keeper.\n\nDoes she need to monitor what she eats over time, yes. Does that mean that any specific foods should be absolutely forbidden...no...for the simple reason that she will crave them and binge. Anyone with common sense or any knowledge of food psychology knows this. \n\nI have T2 diabetes and eat what I want when I want, sometimes my diet is better than others but if my partner pulled the crap you did, he'd be looking for somewhere else to sleep! \n\nConsider getting your wife some sessions with a dietitian so she gets some proper advice on managing her food intake in moderation and in a healthy way.", "If he's that controlling and belittling, she may view death as a positive alternative to staying with him.", "10 years? I was thinking 2-5 years  but I\u2019m not a cardiologist", "And then people will call him AH for leaving a sick partner because they can't adjust. Poor guy.", "I will give you the NTA if you accept that you need to file for divorce today. This is never getting better and you will always, always, always have to go through the same shit every week. She doesn\u2019t care. She doesn\u2019t care if she gets amputated. She doesn\u2019t care if she dies. And then you will have to be her caretaker and suffer and hear her complain how unfair life is. So, cut your losses because she is an addict and she will take you down with her.\n\nThe \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I know what I\u2019m doing\u201d is what should be your evidence that she doesn\u2019t care. \n\nDot feel guilty. She doesn\u2019t want to be helped.", "Then apologize to her.  Tell her you realize that the only one who has a right to control her is her, and that includes her diet, but that you hope she'll make healthy choices because you would hate to watch her health deteriorate, and that you're there to help her any way she wants if you can.  Then ask if she'll let you go to the endocrinologist with her to better understand what's going on so that you can try to avoid going into asshole mode again.", "I feel for this dude. What's gonna happen when she goes blind or starts to lose limbs because she can't cut the sugar addiction?", "This relies on the assumption that your attempt to \"intervene\" is going to help. It's not.

Exactly. \n\nI would also like to add, we don\u2019t really know how often this happens, either. If she only indulges sometimes and he does this every single time, quite frankly, I\u2019d drive off, too. \n\nDiabetes is no joke, but it\u2019s not a death sentence, either. The way everyone\u2019s acting up on this thread is wild, and just shows that they only know diabetes = no sugar forever and ever.", "Also what is meant by fried food?\n\nFried eggs for example are a low carb food and wouldn\u2019t cause a spike in blood sugar", "Plant based diet? For diabetes? Well now you're just making shit up.

Her last A1C was 10.1.  The internet tells me that's very bad.", "Sorry but I absolutely would tell someone with diabetes to avoid highly processed and fried food \u2014 it\u2019s not as simple as eat less carbs. It\u2019s more like eat complex carbs, lean protein, healthy fats etc. Fried foods and trans fats have an adverse effect on metabolism as well. Clearly the gummy bears are part of a bigger picture of bad dietary and lifestyle choices (and possibly genetics) to have an A1C of 10. I don\u2019t agree with his approach but eating fried food etc is absolutely part of the problem and not just carbs.", "if you type 1's and us type 2's get together we might make the forbidden and ultimate type, 3\n\nbut in all seriousness it sucks having to watch what we eat all the time, cried once cause i jsut wanted to have another soda but with how bad my meds were before i just couldn't and suffered but with my current set up i can maybe even have a sippy of juice too >w> i will outlive god out of spite", "I have a friend who ignored her diabetes when younger.  She is not even 60 and is on dialysis, had a foot amputated, is almost blind, and has a host of other issues.", "Better read up on THAT one and buy some magazines for the bathroom if you chose to proceed.", "I thought I was cracking up, so I\u2019m glad others are pointing this out. I started out on metformin, then moved to glipazide, and then insulin added. All because my A1C wasn\u2019t coming down to below 8.0. No way his wife is at 10 and on metformin only."]}
