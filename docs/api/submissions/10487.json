Even though my wife knows that she has diabetes she doesn\u2019t seem to care at all that she has diabetes. She has been on a strict medication that her doctor has set her which has been some foods and she\u2019s not allowed to eat fried/sugary stuff as this will raise her sugar levels. \n\nYesterday i went to the the shop and she came with me and i bought what we needed to get and she just followed along with me. As we are at the till she says that she needs to go to the toilet and will meet me outside. When i\u2019m done with paying i go outside only to see my wife opening a packet of haribos which the doctor says she\u2019s not allowed to eat.\n\nI quickly run over before she open it and i grab it out of her hand and throw it in the bin. She starts getting angry saying that i\u2019m a bitch and a overprotective motherfucker and she starts crying almost saying how it\u2019s not fair how she\u2019s not allowed to eat sweets. I tell her to stop and say that i cannot let her eat that.\n\nShe grabs my keys for my car and she drives away leaving me at the shop. I call her over and over and she doesn\u2019t pick up. I\u2019m absolutely furious at her and start walking home. As soon as i\u2019m home i see her eating fried food on the sofa and i grab the food out of her hand saying that you cannot eat that. I also yell at her saying that she\u2019s selfish leaving me at the shop like that. She doesn\u2019t care and picks up the food and shoves it at my face and calls me a prick and leaves the house. I don\u2019t know where she is and not sure if i\u2019m the asshole. I love her a lot and i cant let her eat those types of foods as it\u2019s bad for her. AITA?\n\nEDIT- She came home after about an hour and said she was sorry and that i\u2019m being overprotective and says that she\u2019s knows what she\u2019s doing and i\u2019m being an asshole for not letting her do what she wants.", "created_utc": 1676927125, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117ki89/aita_for_not_letting_my_wife_eat_what_she_wants_to/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We can't have it constantly as others without diabetes can, but we can treat ourselves with treats and enjoy life without cutting out food that we love all the time. I definitely had a at first issue cutting down on sweets when I first got diagnosed, but with a good between with exercise, appointments with my doctor's/endocrinologist to keep track of my sugars along with testing with my CGM, it is okay to have your sweets as long as you keep in moderation/portions and with me plan ahead with my insulin.\n\nYTA, and you are VERY uninformed of how to go about this. Do more research, join diabetic groups and talk to those who ARE diabetic and how they balance eating unhealthy foods they like and keeping their sugars under control and then go to your wife with these ideas in mind.

Sadly, you cannot help someone that refuses to help themselves.", "YTA. She's your wife, not your kid. I understand you want the best for her, but that's HER decision to make, not yours. If she continues eating against her doctor's orders and he finds out or her bloodwork comes back bad, maybe she'll change how she eats. Until then, it's not your job to treat her like that. Support her to eat differently, not yell at her and grab it from her hands then throw it away.", "ESH. \n\nYour wife is an adult, and as disappointing as it is, she is allowed to make choices against doctors orders as a fully autonomous independent person. \n\nThat being said, if she's feeling super deprived of her favorite foods, why not make an appointment with a registered dietician (not a nutritionist) and see how you can incorporate the things she wants to eat in a way that's accessible to her diet?

You\u2019re heart is in the right place of wanting to help her and as someone who has T2D and has watched loved ones struggle with T2D it\u2019s commendable that you want to \u201csave\u201d her. You can\u2019t control her though. She knows what she can and can\u2019t eat. She knows what she should do but isn\u2019t doing it. T2D is a struggle. Sugar can be just as strong of an addiction as anything else. Instead of going all dictator on her and scolding her like a child and throwing away her food, why not sit down and have a serious conversation with her, apologize and then talk about how you want her around to grow old with and if she doesn\u2019t take care of herself that can\u2019t happen. Offer to get her some sugar free candies and make a plan for \u201csplurge\u201d meals once a month that she can look forward to (and make it a date to help her feel even more special). They make soooooooo many keto, sugar free, protein packed snacks, chips, candies, etc now that it\u2019s not the same as it used to be. Be her support in this otherwise she will just keep binging in secret.

Skip a workout, watch TV instead of clean, etc.\n\nHonestly, it's not your business what she eats. Maybe you guys can have a discussion and advocate for a treat once or twice a week, maybe you can help her find healthy alternatives and switch to fruit over processed sugar, but you're definitely overstepping and ruining your relationship. \n\nThat being said, she shouldn't have left you at the shop.", "YTA\n\nType 2 diabetes for about 4 years now.\n\nSometimes, yes, I do eat candy. You try and take ANY food out of my hands? I'm done with you xD", "YTA for being controlling but I understand why you did that.\n\nHow long has it been since your wife was diagnosed? If it is recent she needs to take some time to adjust. This is a major lifestyle change and it isn\u2019t easy. Aside from the dietary changes she has to get used to monitoring her blood sugar and learning the signs of being too high or low. \n\nIf my husband snatched food away from me, I\u2019d go and eat more of something forbidden in defiance. It sounds like your wife and I have similar personalities! So don\u2019t police her. When things are calmer, talk to her about how you can support her. At a minimum, at least to start, that means you don\u2019t eat sweets or scarf carbs in front of her. Perhaps meet with a dietician to help come up with meal plans. Just remember this is a big thing to have to adjust to.\n\nAlso if you are drinkers, be aware of the carbs and sugars lurking in beer, wine, and cocktails.\n\nPoorly controlled diabetes eventually leads to cardiovascular issues, neuropathy, poor circulation, eye issues, among other things. My husband, ironically a doctor who was very strict with his diabetic patients, failed to control his diabetes until he had his first stents placed 12 years ago. He has since had a stroke, has neuropathy that makes it nearly impossible for him to walk, his vagus nerve is affected so he has a bladder stimulator and gastrointestinal issues, and cerebral vascular disease/dementia, among other things. He\u2019s in his early 70s and is doing fairly well despite it all but he will continue to decline. The damage was done long ago. So when you can have a discussion with your wife, tell her you don\u2019t want to see her go through things like this, and do your best to support her.", "YTA. I was going to go ESH but you repeatedly took food out of her hand that super sucks. I get that you\u2019re worried but this isn\u2019t the way. It\u2019s extremely difficult to change your entire lifestyle and sweets and/or fried foods can be had occasionally (my mom has diabetes and is very healthy eating certain foods in moderation). Someone else recommended an appointment with a dietician and I think that\u2019s the best idea for you guys. You need to get familiar with the limits so your wife can be healthier without making her feel like she needs to completely go without foods that make her happy", "YTA, but ONLY for the part about snatching food out of her hands. That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nI have watched my grandma bend over backwards to try to manage my grandpa\u2019s weight and diabetes, and he just doesn\u2019t take care of himself.

Just what your wife needs, on tip of a disease with no cure is to be policed on every decision she makes.\n\nIt is brutal to be diabetic.  There is no cure, only treatment. Then there is the abuse by medical professionals who think it is a moral issue and not a medical one.\n\nEventually there is insulin. And fighting to keep the sugar on the numbers with that is an utter joy. How do I know? I am diabetic.  \n\nThere are diabetic educators, nutritionists, and others who can help your wife. What you did was cruel. What if she was having a sugar low?", "You can't force her to accept the realities of her condition.  I went undiagnosed with type 2 diabetes for God knows how long because I didn't want to accept it, but my family members knew that nagging me would make me resist more.  Someone snatching food out of my hands while in public would have absolutely ensured that I'd have shoved them in my face out of sheer spite.  Or cause me to stress eat something even worse.

Do you honestly think snatching food out of her hands is going to help the situation?", "YTA, there is ways to handle this type of situation.  Figure out why she needed to eat those candies and why in secret.  Watch her levels through out the day to make sure she is okay.   Talk to a nutritionists to figure out how to get her off sugar.  I believe there are sugar free gummies out there.  Help her find alternative foods that will help her cravings.  Sugar can be addictive and very difficult to stop.

My grandparents have been married almost 30 years and my Papa doesn't take care of his diabetes the way he should either, my grandma just reminds him then says \"if he won't do x, that's on him, not me.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's an adult and is fully capable of choosing what to eat and what not to eat.

I understand that you have good intentions but you are not your wife's boss she and only she can decide what she wants to do with her health. There are a lot of ways for type 2 diabetics to control their sugar intake. And honestly a good doctor will tell you you need to watch carbohydrates. There is no reason she can't have a snack as long as she compensates her insulin for that and does the exercises for that. But at the end of the day this is her body, her health, and her life.

Would OP have had the same reaction if she ate a plain baked potato instead? No, which is just as impactful as eating sugar would be to a diabetic. OP needs to go look at a glycemic index chart. \n\nGlucose: 100\nSucrose (table sugar): 65\nBread: 75\nPotatoes: 75-90\nWhite rice:73\nCorn Flakes cereal: 81\n\nYes, a bowl of corn flakes for breakfast is SIGNIFICANTLY more impactful than table sugar to blood glucose levels to a diabetic. What is she eating at home that OP approves of? Guarantee it's lots of things off the high glycemic index list.\n\nI'm a T2 and my last A1C was 6.1 from a high of 11.8. My fasting glucose is under 90. I've lost 130lbs since my diagnosis. Guess what? I still eat carbs! Potatoes, rice, corn (bread too until I went GF). Even candy and GF cookies sometimes! Controlling diabetes isn't just \"don't eat sugar\". Clearly OP hasn't even taken the time to try to understand his partner's disease. Is his partner doing what they need to do so they can safely enjoy carbs on occasion? No clue because OP hasn't taken the time to find out and tell us. Maybe if she was insulin dependent (T1 or T2) and knew her sugars were high and still was eating gummy bears, that might warrant such a heavy handed response (because there is a real risk of diabetic coma and other immediate health risks). But a T2 on oral meds isn't going to immediately die if they eat a few grams of sugar (the risk is long term damage). \n\nBoth need to sit down together with her doctor and a nutritionist, and likely a therapist as well. Diabetes is a serious disease, but it can be managed without resorting to humiliating those we care about.
