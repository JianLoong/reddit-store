My mom made me promise (again at like 10 years old) that I would ALWAYS take care of my teeth if she agreed to get them fixed.\n\nI got them off a couple of years later and they put two permanent retainers in and gave me a nightly retainer similar to the Invisalign - clear and plastic that goes over your teeth. I asked for the metal one instead but I don\u2019t know if the orthodontist or my mom decided that the other would be better. I hated it- I mean no matter how well you clean them they are made from clear plastic? I was really bad at keeping up with wearing it, did my best through middle school and high school but absolutely gave up on it by college.\n\nPlus in my senior year the top permanent retainer broke and they just took it off. My front teeth shifted VERY little - really I cannot tell at all, they just sort of made themselves more comfortable lol.\n\nBut now my mom points it out often and is upset with me.

Also, the molars were the issue and they are totally fine, my dentist has said nothing.\n\nMy mom wants me to get Invisalign and fix them but I outright refused.

My bottom teeth did a tiny bit. However, some people\u2019s teeth really start to revert back to their original position, and they have to get braces again. My sister unfortunately went through this. It\u2019s understandable that your mom is worried after all her sacrifice and investment that your teeth might end up back the way they would\u2019ve been had she not spent all that money on braces. \n\nThe solution here to speak to your dentist and get reassured your teeth are fine, and tell your mom that, and also reassure her that they\u2019re keeping an eye on it. And on the off chance there really is an issue, you can discuss your options with the dentist.", "NTA\n\nThe braces did their job. You're 23 and paying for your own dental care now, and she is being strangely obsessive about *your* mouth.", "NTA, jeez your mom is really obsessed with your teeth. It sounds like she spent a lot of her hard earned money on it and wanted it perfect. She's being unreasonable. Thank her for originally fixing your teeth but remind her you were a child and did your best back then, and tell her now you are happy with your teeth and don't want to fix them.", "NTA\n\nover time, everyone's teeth shift a bit.  Unless you have retainers and wear them at night forever, they ARE going to shift.\n\nThe clear plastic retainers need to be replaced every couple of years.  Just how it is.  They don't last forever.  \n\nInvisalign are expensive.  At 23, you don't necessarily have the money to pay for them.  \n\nTell your mother that when your teeth begin to bother you and you need to have then straightened again, you'll do so.  Until then, they are OK.  \n\nBut plan to do SOMETHING in a few years.  I guarantee you'll need to.  Even if you simply get mouth guards for night time, you'll need to do something from the sound of it.", "NTA\n\nShe shouldn't be holding this over your head.\n\nHowever, it is something you should talk to your dentist/ortho about, not just outright refuse because it's coming from your mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A lot of people who've had braces as a child ends up getting braces again as an adult for this reason. It's your decision whether you want to invest in making them perfectly straight again.", "Nta I also dislike the invisaline style.  I had a set, and ended up having a wire and plastic set made. You're *23* waaaay past time for mom to be obsessing on your teeth.\n\nIf you wanna shut her up about it, and can afford it, write her a check and tell her you never want to hear another tooth related comment.", "ESH because I don't think you're thinking about your long term health. You're an adult and you can do what you want with your body, but you will have to deal with your mom's nagging and being upset at you for breaking your promise you made at 10. It was thousands of dollars for an easily reversed procedure with an easy, non-life altering solution to preventing its reversal. It would have been cruel to not fix your teeth, so its kinda horrible to hold that over you, but you should be doing the upkeep since it was a medical necessity not cosmetic in your case. There's never the guarantee you teeth won't shift more and cause you problems as you age so it's best to do your preventative care.\n\nIf I were you I'd go to the orthodontist and get the kind of retainer you wanted. Its cheaper than invisalign or braces and will prevent them from moving further.", "NTA.  Your mom was and is an AH for extracting a ridiculous promise from a 10yo.", "NTA\n\nYour mom paid a lot of money for the braces, but she didn't have to clean the braces and retainers or remember to put in the night retainer.\n\nAsk your dentist flat-out if the permanent retainer should be replaced or if you should get Invisalign-type braces. You could ask for a referral to an orthodontist on this, and you could get a second opinion from another dentist.\n\nOnce you've covered all the bases, present the information to your mom. Tell her you love her, and are very thankful she paid for those braces. Then tell her you will be following the advice of your dental-care professionals.", "Nta. You can do whatever you want with your teeth.", "NTA. You literally cannot control how your teeth and mouth adjust themselves. That's your jawbone and muscles moving as you grow.\n\nYour mom is being absurd here. You can certainly brush and take care of your oral hygiene, but that's nothing to do with corrective orthodontics.", "YTA. You're an adult and can decide at this point about your teeth. But the fact that paying for the braces was difficult is reason enough that you **should show appreciation and a little remorse instead of annoyance.**\n\nSee how you are balking at spending your own money for your teeth now? That's how she feels about her original investment being wasted.", "NTA, your body your choice. \n\nBraces are stupidly expensive and your Mom's investment in your health clearly took a toll on your opportunities. Expressing gratitude to her for it but now you are working directly with your own dentist is the only viable path to putting this discussion to bed (and, honestly, you should bring it up with your dentist just to make sure).", "NTA. This is a very odd thing for your mom to be stressing about.", "NTA your mother needs to get over what she thinks you owe her for raising you. Next time ask if she's going to pay for the Invisalign. They're incredibly expensive and if your teeth shift so little it's hardly worth it.", "NTA. Unless your teeth have shifted considerably, it sounds like this is completely normal. When she starts haranguing you, tell her that you are very happy with your teeth and isn\u2019t that the most important thing?", "Do you have a gap in your teeth? Is that what came back when the retainer broke?\n\n\nNTA", "NTA, but I sorta feel what your mom is going through. My daughter's braces cost around 5,000 and insurance doesn't cover a dime despite them being a necessity not for cosmetic. My ex and I had talks to her about the importance of properly maintaining them and keeping her mouth healthy and following all instructions. I remind her she has the equivalent of a used car in her mouth and that it took a lot of saving to get them for her. However she is a teen and I know she slacks from time to time and I am always aware that despite how well she may care for her teeth they may still shift despite attempts. Would I be upset if this were to happen...maybe. Would I demand her to fix it because of the costs I invested ...no. In the end it is your mouth and you are responsible for it now that you're an adult. If you are satisfied with it then that is what matters.", "NTA and your mom is being abusive. She's the parent, she decided to have you, and all the costs involved with raising and caring for a child, while you had zero choice in the matter. Sure, it sucks that kids have medical bills, but that was her decision, not yours. She needs to a) stop blaming you for her own choices and b) not shame your physical appearance, cause that's such a fucked up thing for her to even do in the first place. \n\nAlso, I was told the same thing about needing to wear a retainer 24/7 after my braces were removed. To which I asked, what the hell were the point of the braces then? Like, were my teeth fixed or not? Everyone's teeth move slightly with age. I really didn't care if they were 100% perfect or just 90% pretty alright, because I seriously could not handle wearing a retainer every single day. I'm auADHD so it was both constantly bothering my mouth and was too distracting in school, and then I'd straightup just forget to put it back in after eating. Accidentally threw the damn in the trash multiple times until I gave up on using it entirely. I'm in my 30's now and my teeth are fine. Maybe they'll be terrible later, idk, but I'd rather get full dentures honestly than dealing with that awful retainer.", "Thank you, they told me when they took off the permanent retainer that it could cause them to shift a bit but I can\u2019t even tell that much of a difference. I have discussed it with my current dentist but I think I just need to be firmer and make that clear with my mom. I think she\u2019s just worried about the cosmetic side of it and I totally understand it was her investment and that\u2019s why.", "Yes she really did do so much for me growing up, everything she could with our financial situation. So it definitely stings to think I am hurting her feelings with this. But I also wish she could let go of commenting on little things to do with my appearance like this. Thank you for your comment!", "Thank you! I will definitely be bringing it up with my dentist again for more clarification/reassurance.", "Part of me does wish I had the money now to do this, and maybe that\u2019s what I will try to do someday!", "Thank you for your comment! Yea my regular dentist and I have discussed it and he doesn\u2019t see any need for further action, but maybe I will go to an actual orthopedist to double check! The health issues were from my back teeth and my front were always as straight as they are now so I haven\u2019t thought much of it to be honest!", "Thank you so much for your comment! I will definitely be discussing it with my dentist again just to get some clarification and reassurance for both her and I. I am so very grateful and I definitely want her to always know that.", "That is not true. Every orthodontist will tell you that if you don't consistently wear retainers after having braces, your teeth will move. You keep them straight by wearing your retainer. I'm not giving a judgement on OP but this is not what orthodontists, dentists, and oral surgeons say.", "Yes and once they took off the permanent retainer my teeth moved despite the nightly plastic retainer I was supposed to wear. That\u2019s why I ended up giving up on it, if that makes sense. It just seemed like they needed to \u201csettle in\u201d a little bit lol. But I do think if I had stuck it out until I was a little older and I was done developing they would\u2019ve been fine? Thank you for your comment and perspective!", "Thank you for your comment! I think tone doesn\u2019t come across well over text but I definitely didn\u2019t act annoyed with her when she brought it up! I just explained that I couldn\u2019t even see the difference and that my current dentist wasn\u2019t worried about it as we had talked about it at my last appointment. I am incredibly grateful for her fixing my teeth, as it was a health issue and I wouldn\u2019t be able to chew easily. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s strange to not want to spend money on fixing a tiny cosmetic issue. Again thank you for your perspective :)", ">That\u2019s how she feels about her original investment being wasted. \n\nOh no! Some of her front teeth are no longer perfectly straight. Those braces were a complete waste of money!", "Thank you for your perspective!  I have indeed discussed it with my dentist and all is well! Truly I cannot even see what she means, I wish I could show you all my teeth because everyone else in my life comments on how straight they are \ud83d\ude2d I think I just need to be more direct with her. Thank you again!", "Thank you for your comment! I also find it strange, but she did so much for me growing up even though we were broke that I do hate hurting her feelings like this. Wish she\u2019d just let my teeth go a little bit haha", "Thank you for your comment! I think I will try being more direct like this. The comments from her make me question myself and cause me to be a bit self conscious about my teeth being worse than I think they are", "No I\u2019ve never had any issues with my front teeth, it was all my molars. When the top retainer broke and they took it off my left front tooth moved slightly forward compared to my right front tooth. I wish I could explain how minuscule this change is but my mom notices it", "Haha yes honestly I grew to feel that way too! I tried to never complain to my mom because she\u2019d spent so much money on it but it is frustrating that she still holds it over my head :/", "Thanks again for commenting I really appreciate it", "O yeah! My regular dentist made me wire and plastic retainers.", "\"How long do I have to wear my night retainer?\"---the Kid.\n\n\"As long as you want your teeth to be straight.\" ---the Orthodontist", "Well you did write \"I was obviously annoyed by the conversation.\"", "Haha, I'm good. No teeth pictures required. :)", "Exactly!", "You are right and I did use the word annoyed! I think a better word would\u2019ve been frustrated? We have discussed this many times and I have expressed my gratitude AND remorse for not doing a better job taking care of them. This conversation was the most recent of many many talks and I think she could tell that\u2019s I got frustrated. Thanks again for commenting I really appreciate it", "NTA. Alternatively, I have always worn my retainers and I still do. Guess what? My ortho legitimately accused me of not wearing them because I had one tooth get slightly forward. Dude wanted to put braces back on me. I said hell no. I think the plastic tray retainers, while WAY more comfortable, are not as resilient as the metal ones. Because I had and have a harder plastic bite splint and it always feels way tighter and I can feel the pressure on that one tooth. Plus it\u2019s one tooth, like you. I doubt it\u2019s even noticeable. Though if it\u2019s super prominent, I can kind of see why she\u2019d be annoyed.", "NTA.  Imperfect teeth are perfect.", "Also maybe your wisdom teeth are pushing them out. I had braces and my top teeth are still good but ever since wisdom teeth came through my bottom ones are like wonky piano keys.", "[removed]", "I mean orthopedists are great, but I would definitely recommend an orthodontist for this kind of thing. Save the orthopedic for the rest of your bones lol", "That is so miniscule omg. \n\n\nI only asked if you had a gap because I do and when the same thing happen to me and my retainer  my gap came back.", "These bots are getting bold!
