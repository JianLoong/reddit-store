NTA.\n\nThey are putting you in an unwinnable position and it is NOT (nor has it ever been) your place to be the mature parent. Your extended family is acting like mom & dad's flying monkeys by telling you that you were \"petty\" for reminding them of their words and for trying to guilt you into taking on a role that was never meant for you. \n\nStay strong. And get some support. This might get messy.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like the behavior issues are new, they waiting until he was damn near an adult to seek help. It is NEVER the sibling\u2019s responsibility to pick up the slack of their parents. \n\nPlus, you\u2019re right, he\u2019s a liability.

Your brother is exactly what they wanted him to be.  That's not your problem.\n\nIf you wanted to TRY to help your brother, that would be a valid choice for you to make.  But you are not qualified, so others trying to strong-arm you into doing something are clearly assholes...", "NTA!! \n\nIt sounds like things were probably easier for them when you were still home and able to deflect, but now they're all alone with him and he's almost an adult. \n\nI think it's crazy to blame the fruit of their shitty parenting on you!", "NTA. You are 100% correct - your brother needs professional help. You do not have the training to handle him. It's not fair to you for your parents to try to foist responsibility of your brother onto you because they failed. It sounds like all they want is to make the problem go away the easiest way possible - give it to you.

It's astonishing the gall your parents have trying to dump your brother on you because they don't want to deal with an issue they have allowed to fester. NTA", "NTA - The reality is that you are NOT Miles' parent.  You are his brother.  Even if they hadn't told you before to learn your place, the fact that you aren't his parent means that this isn't a role you have to serve.  Your parents may need to seek professional help, but your brother's behavior is NOT your problem to fix.", "Nope, not your problem. Let them figure it out.", "NTA. Your parents failings should not fall on you.\n\nRegardless as to whether your brother has any kind of behavioral disorder or not, your parents have already failed him.

Unless your parents are psychologists,  they have no clue how relatable you will be to him. \n\nYour parents enabled his behavior and ignored your suggestions because you weren't his parent.  Now they are trying to get you to be a parental figure. \n\nYour brother is a thief and a vandal and has never had boundaries enforced. He could be a danger to you. \n\nYou're right about suggesting other options.  I don't think you have the training needed to help him. More importantly,  you shouldn't have to. He's not your child or legal responsibility. He's your parents' responsibility and also the result of their bad parenting.  Your parents need therapy as much as your brother.  They need to learn how to cope themselves.  Not suggest you allow a disturbed individual into your home.", "NTA. You made your case to your parents. What do they expect you to do? Let the kid move in.", "NTA. Your parents dug their graves and now they have to lay in them. They're exhausted from dealing with a problem of their own making and want to push it onto you so you can take the brunt of it. Your brother does need a lot more than just a close figure to listen to, he needs professional help (like you suggested but your parents ignored you). Everything you said is correct and any relative trying to pressure you into taking him in is hiding behind the excuse of 'he wont won't listen to me im I'm too old' so they aren't expected to take him in.", "NTA, you tried helping and giving them solutions before, but they refused the help then & honestly \"learn your place\" is something I could never imagine telling my own daughter no matter what the context (unless she's talking shit while we're playing a game, I might jokingly say it as I whoop her in said game). \n\nYour parents reap what they sow, you offered them good advice, once again. And they once again ignored it. \n\nOne of the worst things you can do with a troubled/troublesome teenager is to try and have a younger family member intervene, especially if said teenager clearly has issues that require professional help. \n\nStand your ground, ignore the extended family who think you're being childish or tell them that you've tried before & the way you were treated due to it, makes you not want to try again.", "NTA not your son not your problem, they made that clear years ago. They should've gotten him professional help a long time ago. This is all on them not on you. Keep doing what you're doing.", "NTA. I would offer to give your parents sane advice on how to proceed with Milo in exchange for a sincere apology for treating you like shit when you were a kid. You tried to give them sane advice years ago and they snubbed you. If they are ready to listen to your opinion and take your advice, then they can have it. But that\u2019s all you are offering. You are not stepping up as a parent, especially after their past treatment of you.", "NTA and wow, I am sorry your parents suck so much. They're trying to pin 100% of the responsibility for Miles' behavior on you while giving you 0% of the power to actually do anything. If they were ACTUALLY interested in helping their son, they would be banging down the door of any behavioral therapist who would take him. A sibling is not a substitute for professional help, so that shows they aren't really serious about finding a solution. They just want a scapegoat, and they're already starting that process by badmouthing you to the relatives who called up to complain.\n\nThey've failed both of their children frankly.", "Do not have Miles in your home under any circumstances, your parents need to deal with him or as you say outsource him to professionals. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour parents created him, \nRejected your help when you offered, told you to learn your place.\nAs you pointed out, youve learned your place.\n\nYou should not do what for your parents are asking because you are correct, they will blame his lack of turning around on you.  Then rather than them complaining about what a little shit he is, suddenly they will be complaining that you shouldve done X or Y or Z and that would have surely caused him to change.  But if they know X Y and Z they can do those things now.\n\nBut he has been in this pattern of bad behavior with no consequences for his entire life- 16 yrs.  So that pattern is very deep and wide in his consciousness, and will require massive effort skill patience and stamina to help him change his pattern of living to be constructive rather than destructive.  He isnt exactly feral, but he is not far from it.\n\nSo i second your recommendations to your parents - he needs more intensive oversight than you can provide.  \n\nThey need  to check into boot camp, some type of intensive IP therapy /behavior modification, wilderness program, Outward Bound, military school or the like. \n\nHe didnt get like this overnight. It took 16 yrs and  he is not going to change overnight. It will require a long term commitment from your parents and the patience to see it through.  \n\nAs your parents now realize, he is past their ability to redirect him, and he is past your ability to help him as well.  \n\nYour parents created him and they will have to be the ones to facilitate the long term process of helping him change so he can become independent and support himself in life", "NTA with a caveat. Using your parents words \"learn your place\" against them is a little petty, but the underlying point is sound and valid.\n\nMiles has been taught you are not an authority figure and that can't be changed now. He's also been taught your parents outrank you, so anytime he doesn't like your rules he'll go running back to them.\n\nThe idea that he'll obey you because you are closer to his age is also absurd. Peers aren't authority figures, they are peers, so your age is a detriment to trying to reign him in. \n\nYour parents need professional help, or at least a family member with more authority than your parents. Like a strict grandparent, aunt, or uncle.\n\nYou are not an ahole for refusing to voluntarily accept responsibility that isn't yours, especially when your earlier efforts at assisting were rejected.", "NTA.

It seems like they thought they knew so much better when irl they didn\u2019t know their child at all.\n\nYou are not responsible for your brother. They are.", "NTA!!! You are not his parent and this is absolutely not your responsibility. Your parents made this mess and it\u2019s their job to clean it up.\n\nThe relatives telling you that this is somehow your responsibility are out of their minds insane. Block and ignore all of them.", "NTA. I think their going to be in for a surprise when they find out that hes not going to listen to you either. \n\nThis is all on them. Not you. \n\nI get the sense, though, that they don't want to send him to a therapist or boot camp as then they'll lose face in front of their peers. They'll be embarrassed by their shortcomings as parents. This is just a guess, though. I could be way off.\n\nEither way, his behavior isn't your problem, and it's highly doubtful that you'd have any effect anyway. Unfortunately, they've created this problem by ignoring it and not parenting him when he was a child. Too little to late.", "NTA. Unless you are a trained behavioral therapist, how could you help him?  Your advice to them was right. They need to find a place where he can get the help he needs.", "NTA- as they told you , and you told them now, you are not the parent and you are not responsible, or will be responsible for his actions. They need to get professional help and or counseling for his behavior. \n\n\u201cMiles isn\u2019t a little kid throwing a tantrum anymore.\u201d\n\n Exactly. He isn\u2019t a little kid anymore , but yet they expect you to handle him when they can\u2019t. If he isn\u2019t listening to your parents, what on earth makes them think he would listen to a *sibling*?", "NTA. Tell the family members giving you crap that you\u2019ll give it a shot if they give it a shot first. None of them will say yes", "NTA . People like your parents always baffle me. They ignored or gave in to your brother's tantrums when he was younger, refused to get professional help, alienated you when you wanted to help them .  What did they think was going to happen? Small unmanageable children with no discipline , that are not taught any emotional regulation, self control or how to take accountability for their actions, eventually grow into teenagers who don't magically learn these things the parents failed to teach them", "It is NOT your job in this situation to do anything you don't want to. You're an adult, and your parents are reaping the consequences of their bad parenting. \n\nBUT these two things are also true: 1) It's not Miles's fault either, he's a child, and 2) you're his brother. I don't think that means you NEED to step in to discipline him or get him to walk right out whatever. But if you think you can bear hanging out with him, listening to him, being a good role model for him, I think you can live up to the other end of \"you're not his parent\" line which is, \"you're his sibling.\" And developing a healthy SIBLING relationship could help you heal a bit from what a bad job your parents did, as much as it helps him understand maturity and boundaries. \n\nSo 100% NTA, with the caveat that while it's not your responsibility, you do have some power here to maybe improve the situation for everyone", "Tell the flying monkeys that they are more than welcome to take your brother in. But you are not willing to do so. Go LC/NC and see a therapist to help you to reinforce boundaries. Best of luck.", "ESH, but like a 90-10 split with your parents taking that 90% asshole slot, but give your bro a shot, who knows? If it doesn't work, then at least you tried, and then you can push even harder on whatever else you had in mind. Your parents fucked up majorly by not actually listening and trying harder when he was younger, but it looks like they are trying now, and I definitely see why you would wanna say no to them, but it would be hurting your bro more IF you were able to actually reach out to him and flip that switch AND refused to even try just to get back at your parents. It's that type of pettiness that I like, but idk.\n\nI know you aren't a trained professional, but maybe just a nice heartfelt chat could change things. But definitely let them know you are only doing it on the condition that he does get professional help, preferably at the same time.", "ESH. You\u2019re spiting your brother because your parents told you years ago to butt out. You\u2019re an adult now, and your brother is struggling. You said yourself you felt that your parents didn\u2019t give him the adequate care he needed. You little brother is still a kid, he\u2019s only 16. You have the opportunity to at least try to be a mentor to him. You\u2019re his big brother, you can act like it for his sake, regardless of how your parents felt or feel.", "Sorry Mom and Dad, I'm not the 'cool' sibling you're looking for. You'll have to find another Jedi to train your young Padawan.\" #NotMyJob", "Tell anyone who butts in, you're so thrilled they offered to help. You'll have your parents get a hold of them right away. Watch how fast the backtrack starts. NTA.", "This! What are you supposed to do but get him the same interventions you\u2019ve already suggested\u2026which his school has probably suggested, too? NTA", "It just won\u2019t work.  Miles is 16 and already in trouble with the law and has no boundaries.  He\u2019s not going to allow or follow any corrective actions like grounding and is most likely to steal and break OPs stuff.  OP is right and has given all the help they can - they need to send him to a professional. NTA", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of \u201cmight\u201d get messy, I\u2019d bet it\u2019s a matter of \u201cwhen\u201d. Definitely second the idea of OP getting external support", "OP's extended family are afraid they'll be asked to take Miles if OP doesn't. They will do ANYTHING  to avoid that situation", "They didn't want to parent him as a child and they don't want to parent him now. I'm not saying that who he's become is 100% on the parents, but they didn't want to put in the work to address their child's behavior when it mattered and it's too late now. The poorly behaved chickens have come home to roost (and destroy it). The sowed nothing so they reap nothing but weeds. Actions, meet consequences", "Either move Miles in or have OP return to the family home.", "If my brother was screwing up that much, I wouldn't trust him anywhere near me. Miles sounds like a kid who'd take every and any inch of trust his brother gave him and run right over it, laughing all the way about how his brother \"can't take a joke\" and is \"such a trusting loser.\"", "Nailed it", "I think they're coming to the realization that his behavior won't fix itself and it's starting to have a more serious impact on them. \n\nThey were selfish before, no reason to think this doesn't also come from a place of selfishness.", "You keep saying you always knew you would be legally responsible. What does that mean?", "No you are not legally responsible for your brother or his actions your parents are !!! Distance yourself  and seek therapy to reduce the impact of this in\nyour life. \n\nEven if you were willing  this is way beyond your abilities. Your parents caused this do not allow them to guilt you. \n\nYou are just his sibling who knows his place.", "Early intervention makes all the difference. They can\u2019t control him now so it\u2019s easier to pawn him off", "Some kids are sexual abused by their parents and play up because of it and those parents of course don't want professionals to find out. Not saying it's likely, but it's not impossible.\n\nMy husband had a co-worker, middle class family, wife and two kids, own house in a good neighborhood, normal friendly guy, who ended up in prison for this. Nobody saw that coming.", "Miles will, at some point, mess around in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong person, and he\u2019ll be calling you and your parents from jail. \n\nStart thinking through how you\u2019ll set and enforce boundaries there so you\u2019re not caught flat-footed when the inevitable happens and your parents try to make you clean up Miles\u2019 mess. Set the precedent early so everyone knows you\u2019re not the bail bondsman or legal costs underwriter.", "I would still install cameras. Because honestly your parents sound desperate and I would not be surprised if he showed up on your door step.", "That's my read, too. They keep trying to deal with Miles internally, because getting outside agents involved would be a shameful admission of failure. They'd rather flush Miles' life away than admit they're unable to parent him and need outside intervention.", "Yup. I'm actually a professional who does a lot of early intervention work. Basically angry/violent kids, single digit ages. I've been very proud of my success but I wouldn't take this case on. I would be recommending a secure inpatient treatment centre.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking.

If you fail, you're at fault. If you succeed, then you'll be stuck with Miles forever. \n\nAlso, there's a HUGE difference between you having a chat with your brother and moving him out of their home and in with you. I think you've been so deep in this crazy, you're not seeing how absolutely crackers it is for parents to throw up their hands and dump complete parental responsibility onto the other child.\n\nNone of this is normal OP. Run very fast away from this craziness. NTA", "Sadly, be ready to be blamed for his behavior for NOT taking him in. You are in a no win situation.  The best thing you can do is seek therapy for yourself if needed and stay low contact with your family and no contact with Miles.", "> I'm honestly baffled that his school simply requested him to leave instead of calling the cops over his most recent incident there.\n\nThey probably suspect a diagnosis and don't want your parents (who sound like manipulators and shit stirrers) to sue when he gets a diagnosis.", "NTA and it\u2019s definitely not your fault.\n\nIf he was guilty of assault or also battery, the school was probably trying to spare ruining his life.  Vandalism and petty larceny are one thing.  Violent misdemeanors can escalate to felonies and result in prison.\n\nYour brother would probably only get worse there.  Really good teachers and admins usually try to keep police out of school matters if they can.  Police coming into a school usually escalate the situation, they don\u2019t calmly subdue kids.\n\nI remember seeing statistics a few years ago from a nearby school.  When they introduced police into the building, the number of students on probation/diversion started to increase.  And violent confrontations with \u201cstaff\u201d (meaning the police sent to take a kid to an office) increased in frequency.\n\nNot saying your brother is innocent.  Just that there might be some logic behind his school not involving the police.", "Happy Cake Day \ud83c\udf82", "There might be a reason why the parents didn't seek treatment and why miles was out of control.

Jumping to OP\u2019s parents committing such a heinous act because their kid is bad is wild.", "I didn't say that it's likely, but it's a possibility. Most parents with a kid with behavioural problems would seek professional help. My suggestion would be an explanation why they didn't.", "I don't jump there because of the kids behaviour but more because the parents refuse to seek professional help \n\nIn case of severe mental health conditions, admittedly a more likely explanation, most parents would seek professional help.
