NTA.\n\nThey are putting you in an unwinnable position and it is NOT (nor has it ever been) your place to be the mature parent. Your extended family is acting like mom & dad's flying monkeys by telling you that you were \"petty\" for reminding them of their words and for trying to guilt you into taking on a role that was never meant for you. \n\nStay strong. And get some support. This might get messy.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like the behavior issues are new, they waiting until he was damn near an adult to seek help. It is NEVER the sibling\u2019s responsibility to pick up the slack of their parents. \n\nPlus, you\u2019re right, he\u2019s a liability.

After many years of not fulfilling their obligations and telling you to mind your own business...\n\nNOW they want you to handle their responsibility willingly?\n\nIt's not callous at all to tell the parents to take a long walk on a short pier.  Your brother is exactly what they wanted him to be.  That's not your problem.\n\nIf you wanted to TRY to help your brother, that would be a valid choice for you to make.  But you are not qualified, so others trying to strong-arm you into doing something are clearly assholes...", "NTA!! \n\nIt sounds like things were probably easier for them when you were still home and able to deflect, but now they're all alone with him and he's almost an adult. \n\nI think it's crazy to blame the fruit of their shitty parenting on you!", "NTA. You are 100% correct - your brother needs professional help. You do not have the training to handle him. It's not fair to you for your parents to try to foist responsibility of your brother onto you because they failed. It sounds like all they want is to make the problem go away the easiest way possible - give it to you. And, I suspect their resistance to professional help is from an old, ingrained stigma attached to psychiatric care (and, by association, to the families of those who receive this care).", "NTA.

It's astonishing the gall your parents have trying to dump your brother on you because they don't want to deal with an issue they have allowed to fester. NTA", "NTA - The reality is that you are NOT Miles' parent.  You are his brother.  Even if they hadn't told you before to learn your place, the fact that you aren't his parent means that this isn't a role you have to serve.  Your parents may need to seek professional help, but your brother's behavior is NOT your problem to fix.", "Nope, not your problem. Let them figure it out.", "NTA. Your parents failings should not fall on you.\n\nRegardless as to whether your brother has any kind of behavioral disorder or not, your parents have already failed him. They have blindly let him run riot for his whole life and not he's being asked to change school, they want you to step in. \n\nYou have your own life to lead, and being parent to an unruly teen that your parents can't control is not it!", "NTA.  Unless your parents are psychologists,  they have no clue how relatable you will be to him. \n\nYour parents enabled his behavior and ignored your suggestions because you weren't his parent.  Now they are trying to get you to be a parental figure. \n\nYour brother is a thief and a vandal and has never had boundaries enforced. He could be a danger to you. \n\nYou're right about suggesting other options.  I don't think you have the training needed to help him. More importantly,  you shouldn't have to. He's not your child or legal responsibility. He's your parents' responsibility and also the result of their bad parenting.  Your parents need therapy as much as your brother.  They need to learn how to cope themselves.  Not suggest you allow a disturbed individual into your home.", "NTA. You made your case to your parents. What do they expect you to do? Let the kid move in.", "NTA. Your parents dug their graves and now they have to lay in them. They're exhausted from dealing with a problem of their own making and want to push it onto you so you can take the brunt of it. Your brother does need a lot more than just a close figure to listen to, he needs professional help (like you suggested but your parents ignored you). Everything you said is correct and any relative trying to pressure you into taking him in is hiding behind the excuse of 'he wont won't listen to me im I'm too old' so they aren't expected to take him in.", "NTA, you tried helping and giving them solutions before, but they refused the help then & honestly \"learn your place\" is something I could never imagine telling my own daughter no matter what the context (unless she's talking shit while we're playing a game, I might jokingly say it as I whoop her in said game). \n\nYour parents reap what they sow, you offered them good advice, once again. And they once again ignored it. \n\nOne of the worst things you can do with a troubled/troublesome teenager is to try and have a younger family member intervene, especially if said teenager clearly has issues that require professional help. \n\nStand your ground, ignore the extended family who think you're being childish or tell them that you've tried before & the way you were treated due to it, makes you not want to try again.", "NTA not your son not your problem, they made that clear years ago. They should've gotten him professional help a long time ago. This is all on them not on you. Keep doing what you're doing.", "NTA. I would offer to give your parents sane advice on how to proceed with Milo in exchange for a sincere apology for treating you like shit when you were a kid. You tried to give them sane advice years ago and they snubbed you. If they are ready to listen to your opinion and take your advice, then they can have it. But that\u2019s all you are offering. You are not stepping up as a parent, especially after their past treatment of you.", "NTA and wow, I am sorry your parents suck so much. They're trying to pin 100% of the responsibility for Miles' behavior on you while giving you 0% of the power to actually do anything. If they were ACTUALLY interested in helping their son, they would be banging down the door of any behavioral therapist who would take him. A sibling is not a substitute for professional help, so that shows they aren't really serious about finding a solution. They just want a scapegoat, and they're already starting that process by badmouthing you to the relatives who called up to complain.\n\nThey've failed both of their children frankly.", "Do not have Miles in your home under any circumstances, your parents need to deal with him or as you say outsource him to professionals. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour parents created him, \nRejected your help when you offered, told you to learn your place.\nAs you pointed out, youve learned your place.\n\nYou should not do what for your parents are asking because you are correct, they will blame his lack of turning around on you.  Then rather than them complaining about what a little shit he is, suddenly they will be complaining that you shouldve done X or Y or Z and that would have surely caused him to change.  But if they know X Y and Z they can do those things now.\n\nBut he has been in this pattern of bad behavior with no consequences for his entire life- 16 yrs.  So that pattern is very deep and wide in his consciousness, and will require massive effort skill patience and stamina to help him change his pattern of living to be constructive rather than destructive.  He isnt exactly feral, but he is not far from it.\n\nSo i second your recommendations to your parents - he needs more intensive oversight than you can provide.  \n\nThey need  to check into boot camp, some type of intensive IP therapy /behavior modification, wilderness program, Outward Bound, military school or the like. \n\nHe didnt get like this overnight. It took 16 yrs and  he is not going to change overnight. It will require a long term commitment from your parents and the patience to see it through.  \n\nAs your parents now realize, he is past their ability to redirect him, and he is past your ability to help him as well.  \n\nYour parents created him and they will have to be the ones to facilitate the long term process of helping him change so he can become independent and support himself in life", "NTA with a caveat. Using your parents words \"learn your place\" against them is a little petty, but the underlying point is sound and valid.\n\nMiles has been taught you are not an authority figure and that can't be changed now. He's also been taught your parents outrank you, so anytime he doesn't like your rules he'll go running back to them.\n\nThe idea that he'll obey you because you are closer to his age is also absurd. Peers aren't authority figures, they are peers, so your age is a detriment to trying to reign him in. \n\nYour parents need professional help, or at least a family member with more authority than your parents. Like a strict grandparent, aunt, or uncle.\n\nYou are not an ahole for refusing to voluntarily accept responsibility that isn't yours, especially when your earlier efforts at assisting were rejected.", "NTA.

Point that out to everyone. \n\nYou want the best for Miles, you\u2019ve been concerned about him for years. You don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re refusing to get him qualified help. It\u2019s bizarre to you that they\u2018ve tried nothing, & claim to be done with their struggling child. And now think you should take him in & fix him, as if he\u2019s subhuman. They\u2019re twisting themselves inside out rationalizing abandoning him, & forcing him on you. \n\nThey need to find a psychiatrist that specializes in adolescents & behavioral issues. The two of them should go see the dr, get advice on how to handle Miles. Despite seeing what their lazy parenting approach has done to Miles, they\u2019re continuing it.", "Yeah obvious NTA.\n\nIf it were me, I'd give a single \"not my problem\" and not reply to anymore messages or calls about this issue.\n\nActually, if it were my I might have already blocked their number.\n\nThey made their bed.", "Your parents are coming to the realization that *they* aren't the help that Miles needs. Which is good: that's progress. Unfortunately, instead of involving pros, they're now trying to turn to you. That's bad, and will not prove to be progress, nor will it be any help to Miles. Hold your position, OP.", "> try to foist responsibility of your brother onto you because they failed\n\nI hadn't considered this before reading the responses on here. I always knew I would be legally responsible if Miles does something stupid (I am honestly baffled that the cops were not called after the incident that lead to Miles being kicked out of his current school.) But I also realize that they'll probably blame me if Miles doesn't magically turn around while in my \"care.\"", ">Regardless as to whether your brother has any kind of behavioral disorder or not\n\nIt's possible he could but they've never taken him to a psychiatrist. What they should do is see if he has an actual disorder. If he's diagnosed, send him to an in-person therapy camp/program. If he's just spoiled, send him to boot camp. But that's something they would have to willing do and look into.", "If the parents are indeed psychologists, obviously, they didn\u2019t pay attention in class.", "Exactly right.", "Those troubled teen industry programs are full of horrifying child abuse and neglect that parents pay a lot of money for. Don't recommend ops parents send the brother there.\n\nThey need to have him professionally evaluated and get professional (science based) recommendations for next steps. Maybe involve social services if needed.", "And this \"change\" will likely not happen adequately by the time he's 18yo. And can then decide he wants nothing to do with the \"correction efforts\" & stops participating. Leading to some very unpleasant accommodations.", "OP telling the brother about any plan is not his responsibility.", ">He\u2019s a big kid throwing tantrums.\n\nI'm honestly baffled that his more recent \"tantrums\" (especially the one that lead to him getting kicked out of his school) haven't landed him in jail, or at least juvie.", "They don't have a key to my apartment, thank god.", "Absolutely. The fact that the parents are bad mouthing OP already to family members shows they're looking for scapegoats, not serious answers.", "My parents don't do any work in mental health. They're actually the type of people who say to others that having mental health issues isn't something to be ashamed of but would be very embarrassed and would try to hide if they or a family member had mental health issues.", "Technically, none of this is OP's responsibility. The brother **might** be more agreeable if the news is told by the sibling. Getting the parents to agree to boarding school seems more of a challenge than forcing the brother to go.", "Your parents may be doing something behind the scenes to prevent that from happening. Or, it could just be uneven (possibly racist, to your brother\u2019s benefit) application of standards for behaviour.", ">they're looking for scapegoats, not serious answers.\n\nI hadn't considered this before reading the responses on here. I always knew I'd be legally responsible if Miles did something (I'm honestly baffled that his school simply requested him to leave instead of calling the cops over his most recent incident there.) But I also realize now that my parents would blame me for Miles not magically turning around while in my \"care.\"", "Yeah, you can\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm. Doing this would certainly make OP\u2019s life difficult and with probably little reward because they\u2019ll just go back to letting Miles get his way and enable his bad behavior. NTA", "Even from what little you've shared, they are clearly manipulators and have been for at least your entire life. They have no interest in solutions, just ways to avoid responsibilities and to blame someone else for their faults. There is no reconciliation with this kind of person.\n\nIMO, disconnect completely and move on with your life. They will continue to find ways to use and abuse your trust and good will, because to them those qualities are a weakness to be exploited. Find better people to spend your time with.\n\nMy family was similar."]}
