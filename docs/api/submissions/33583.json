She can do that in the car or in the bathrooms at school.\r  \n\r  \nI recently got reprimanded at work because Amina wouldn\u2019t hurry up and I ended up being 30 minutes late. Luckily, nothing went on my work record. But enough was enough for me with Amina. I told Amina about what happened and that I wouldn\u2019t be driving her to and from school anymore. Amina begged me to give her another chance but I said no.

Amina did explain what happened a few times to me but I still don\u2019t fully understand if I\u2019m being honest. I don\u2019t really think it matters anyway. Taylor hasn\u2019t been bullying Amina, they just don\u2019t like each other. I told Amina just don\u2019t say anything to Taylor and Taylor won\u2019t say anything to you.

Sometimes you\u2019re going to have to be a bit uncomfortable but part of life is learning to deal with it and move on.\r  \n\r  \nToday I had to tell Amina again that I wasn\u2019t changing my mind and she sarcastically told me that I gave her a great gift for Christmas. I\u2019m wondering if I am actually being unreasonable and don\u2019t understand how hard the original boyfriend drama was for Amina because normally she would have just accepted no the first time and isn\u2019t this persistent.
