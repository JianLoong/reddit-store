But from week one, Amina has not been respecting my time and has forced us to leave the house late. it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re late because she\u2019s brushing her teeth or doing something else she needs, she\u2019s putting on makeup. She can do that in the car or in the bathrooms at school.\r  \n\r  \nI recently got reprimanded at work because Amina wouldn\u2019t hurry up and I ended up being 30 minutes late. Luckily, nothing went on my work record. But enough was enough for me with Amina. I told Amina about what happened and that I wouldn\u2019t be driving her to and from school anymore. Amina begged me to give her another chance but I said no. I\u2019ve already given her enough chances and talks about why it\u2019s important that we leave on time and she didn\u2019t treat them seriously.

Amina did explain what happened a few times to me but I still don\u2019t fully understand if I\u2019m being honest. I don\u2019t really think it matters anyway. Taylor hasn\u2019t been bullying Amina, they just don\u2019t like each other. I told Amina just don\u2019t say anything to Taylor and Taylor won\u2019t say anything to you.

Sometimes you\u2019re going to have to be a bit uncomfortable but part of life is learning to deal with it and move on.\r  \n\r  \nToday I had to tell Amina again that I wasn\u2019t changing my mind and she sarcastically told me that I gave her a great gift for Christmas. I\u2019m wondering if I am actually being unreasonable and don\u2019t understand how hard the original boyfriend drama was for Amina because normally she would have just accepted no the first time and isn\u2019t this persistent.

Nope, I would have left without her. So now she gets to carpool with someone she doesn\u2019t like. That\u2019s the consequences.
