We share a home together that we moved into about 3 months ago.

Everyone has different issues, they aren\u2019t all the same.\n\nBecause of my issues, there are some chores that I am unable to do. For example, I can\u2019t wash the dishes because I can\u2019t stand touching wet food. Things like that.\n\nI talked to Fran about this before we moved in and she was more than happy to do the chores I cannot do.\n\nWashing the dishes, cleaning the kitchen & bathroom and mowing the lawn are the chores I am unable to do due to these issues. Fran has told me many times that she is happy to do them.\n\nI do understand that it would be unfair to let her do everything so I picked up some of my own chores. I do the bills, laundry, grocery shopping, tidying the living room & bedroom and taking care of the animals in the house. We are both happy with this and living together has been going great.\n\nAbout a week or so ago, her parents visited the house for the first time (they live out of state). The dishes in the sink hadn\u2019t been done and Fran said something along the lines of \u201cSorry about the dishes, I haven\u2019t had chance to do them yet\u201d.\n\nHer Dad asked why I couldn\u2019t have done them, to which Fran said \u201cChris isn\u2019t able to do them\u201d.\n\nLater that day, her Dad pulled me to the side and had a chat with me. He basically told me to \u2018man up\u2019 and start pulling my weight around the house and that I can\u2019t just sit back and let Fran do everything because I don\u2019t want to it. I tried explaining why we have this boundary set in place and he would take none of it.\n\nI haven\u2019t told Fran he did this because I don\u2019t want to upset her or make her Dad even angrier. I can\u2019t help but let this get to me and feel like I\u2019m an asshole for making Fran do certain chores.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686786619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149n14o/aita_for_making_my_girlfriend_do_certain_chores/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How would you clean your home?", "As an autistic person myself with sensory issues, I'm torn between NAH and the most gentle YTA ever.\n\nUnfortunately, cleaning bathrooms and doing the dishes are a part of life. What if Fran gets sick and you have to take over her chores while she rests and recovers? Or any other circumstance that means you're responsible for these tasks?\n\nYou can do the dishes with gloves on. Thicker rubber cleaning gloves are available and mean you'll barely even feel any potential food floaties (though you should be scraping off your plates before washing in a basin, ideally.)\n\nSame for the bathroom. Nobody likes having to scrub the toilet or pull hair out of the shower plug, but there are a wide range of accessible tools that can help with this, like down-spout drain plugs, extendable toilet brushes, ect. For autistic people finding workarounds and tools to help us navigate life is important and greatly improves our ability to function as individuals.\n\nI won't call you an asshole in general because it seems like Fran is happy with the way chores are divided, but I will say it will be beneficial for everyone in the long run if you at least consider trying to desensitise yourself to basic household cleaning.", "Info what did you do before you two lived together?\n\nCan you not alleviate how much work she does with a dishwasher or a roomba?", "YTA.  You can do dishes!  You don't have to touch the wet food.  \nThey have special gloves for washing dishes.  They are usually yellow.  \nAutism doesn't give you an excuse to get out of chores!  FIND A WORK AROUND!", "YTA. Please, for the love of all things good in this world,  can we stop using ASD as a shield? Speaking as someone who has circumvented some the issues that the spectrum gave me, there are coping mechanisms that allow us to complete our everyday tasks. There are also tools and methods that allow us to complete these tasks.\n\nSpeaking from experience, I also hated touching wet food. So guess what I did; I started pre-rinsing all of my dishes. That way, all the food gunk was in the sink grate thingy, and I could just wear a glove to clean the sink grate thingy at the end of washing dishes. It's not hard to find mechanisms in order to do these tasks, but if your outlook on life is \"I have this ick and I'm not gonna do anything about it because spectrum lol\", that makes you the a-hole.", "Who washed your dishes before you moved in with your GF?", "YTA. You leave her with the gross time-consuming stuff and you take the easy, clean stuff? At the very _least_  you should be paying someone to mow the lawn.

I can't stand dirty cloths so I use one for every clean and pop it straight in the washing machine, I get it , it is hard but as adults unless we have employed care givers we have to figure out work around that also mesh with our needs. I have literally made myself physically sick because I put my bare hand in dish water before so please do not think I am judging you for being autistic. For the sake of your relationship find work around a now before it becomes a major issue.", " YTA :/\n\ndoing the dishes doesnt guarantee touching wet food if you guys dump everything in the trash first and blast the dishes w water before scrubbing. You can also wear gloves. \n\nnot sure why you cant clean the kitchen or bathrooms, unless some chemicals or product smell in an overwhelming way? even then you could wear protective gear to help. or at LEAST split it up by one of yall doing the counters/putting stuff up and the other sweeping/mopping.

What would you do if you lived alone?", "You aren't making her do those chores. From the way you've described things, this was an agreement between the two of you that works between partners. Her dad has nothing to do with that. NTA, but you or her will need to confront him about this, or he is going to install himself as a permanent part of the relationship. I would recommend finding some therapy or something to help overcome those sensory issues though, as it does seem like you aren't terribly happy with them yourself, but that is ultimately your decision.", "Tell Dad it's none of his fucking business and to get out of your marriage. You and your partner have an equitable arrangement and he isn't a party to it. NTA.\n\nAlso talk to your partner and check in that she's as cool with the arrangement as you assume.", "Have you tried using gloves? Maybe it can help with your problems.\n\nThat being said, you are in a relationship, you talked and negotiated with your partner and you are taking part by doing other chores and trying to do some kind of equal responsibility. You claim you are happy doing those chores. Your girlfriend is happy with her part. As far as both of you are happy and treating each other with equality and respect, I'm not seeing an AH here.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Old boomer man up doesn't understand\u00a0autism or modern couples.

It's her choice", "NTA - no one should be coming in between the two of you its your relationship.  You guys sound like you have a good thing going on, you divvy up the chores and you each do your bit, working to your strengths and picking up the slack for the other.  It was none of his business to pass judgement or to say anything to you HE IS THE A.  Please don't take it to heart or stress over it, hopefully he's left now and won't be coming back again any time soon.", "NTA, what her Dad said wasn't true, you are pulling your weight because you have found a way to divide up the chores between you and you gf. There are other chores that you do that she doesn't have to. And frankly, it's none of his business how you and your gf do things around your house.", "NAH. Fran's dad isn't wrong to be protective of his daughter- you refusing to do household cleaning is a bad look.  The chore distribution looks very uneven. \n\nWhat happens if she gets sick or disabled, even temporarily? She has a partner who won't learn to be a partner in bad circumstances. Any dad would worry.\n\nBut it's working for you and Fran so Fran's dad should mind his own business.\n\nYou should tell Fran, too. Keeping secrets from your partner about her family really backfires, even if you're doing it with good intentions. I found this out the hard way. Don't be me.", "A little of both. My partner and I are like this. They handle most of the laundry  because i forget it constantly, cleaning the bath, and some dishes. I handle the dusting, vacuuming and cooking. This works for us. \n\nSometimes its about what works for the couple - the dad may be trying to watch that his daughter doesnt fall in with the \"thats womens work\" shit and end up doing all housework as well as financial work. There are still cases of this, and he doesnt know your set up.\n\nThat being said, i can set myself alarms on my phone telling me to grab the laundry and if it needs it, i can clean the bath. My issue is the cleaners exacerbate my asthma and my partner doesnt like the smell of the cleaner i can use. It will get done, though. I would definitely try to find work arounds in case you do need to do them.", "NTA and tell her. Her dad is a GUEST and needs to mind his own business.", "NTA but have you considered using gloves so that perhaps your girlfriend could occasionally get a break from certain responsibilities and you guys could switch things up now and again?", "NTA, since Fran seems to be fine with it and her opinion is the only one that really matters. Her dad probably either is one of those boomer types that don't believe autism is a thing, or just thought you were being sexist and making her do \"womens work\" or something and felt the need to defend his daughter. But again, end of the day, it doesn't matter what he says as long as Fran is genuinely ok and happy with your arrangement. As for the dad, personally I think I'd just drop it for now if you think it'll cause a problem with Fran. Shrug it off, he doesn't know what he's angry about. But if it comes up again, then you might need to talk to Fran about it and have her explain to him, bc he's probably never gonna trust your word but he will listen to his daughter lol.\n\nThat said though, I am curious lol. What did you do before you moved in together? Or did you just go straight from your parents house into a home with her and have never lived truly on your own before? (And no judgement if thats the case, I'm still stuck at home myself bc rent is nuts for a single adult. Almost need to be in a relationship to afford a single bedroom these days lol)", "Try that approach from the film; the accountant and man up son.\n\nif agreement NTA but maybe consider if she is not there in future.   \n\n\nshould be looking for a solution.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
