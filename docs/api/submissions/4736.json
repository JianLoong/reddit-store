{"id": 4736, "submission_id": "zlwrqx", "title": "AITA if I stop sending my nephews money for Christmas?", "selftext": "So a little context here I, 35(m) have three nephews that I rarely ever see. My sister, who lives about five hours away from me rarely visits, and we don\u2019t really communicate much. Every year since my nephews were born I would send them either gifts or money for Christmas and birthdays. I have one child who is eight and they have three boys aged 10, 14 and two years old. I feel like I don\u2019t have much of a relationship with any of them because we never see each other and we never talk. Yet I\u2019m expected to make sure they get their Christmas and birthday money from their uncle every year.  In these times where money is very tight and our paycheques don\u2019t go as far as they used to. I feel like, I shouldn\u2019t be doing this anymore and I should be redirecting the money and taking care of my own family. I feel annoyed that I have to send triple the amount of money because there\u2019s three nephews and the amount that\u2019s given to us is only reflective of one child. I just feel like I am over this whole Christmas and birthday money exchange, when we never see each other or make any attempt to communicate. We don\u2019t FaceTime we don\u2019t phone or text nothing. My son rarely even knows his cousins. I haven\u2019t brought this up to my sister because I know she\u2019s going to blow up about it. I\u2019ve already sent out their money for Christmas but I feel like this year is it. As stated id rather redirect that money towards my family opposed to pretty much strangers. And to be honest I wouldn\u2019t be upset if they didn\u2019t send my son anything. He has everything he needs and so do his cousins. I\u2019d much rather we meet up somewhere for the weekend and allow the cousins to get to know each other and play. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671038618, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlwrqx/aita_if_i_stop_sending_my_nephews_money_for/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Say you plan to stop sending money because it doesn't really make sense to you, and that you accept if they don't want to send your child so this can be a mutual thing. Pro-actively suggest that meet up play date.", "I agree I think going cold turkey would be harsh. I think maybe will tell her that I am going to stop with the Christmas and birthday money and try to meet up once or twice a year and do an activity as a family. To me that is more sentimental and it builds the relationship with my son and his cousins and myself and my sister.", "NTA.  And of course she's going to be pissed off.  If I could give someone, say $50 and get $150 in return I would for sure be upset when that stopped!  But if I were the person only getting the $50 I'd shut that down.", "NTA: You don't have bad intentions and not being unreasonable.", "I don't think you are TA for feeling this way. If I were you, I'd discuss this with your sister. Maybe you can mutually call off the exchange of money or make plans to spend the next Christmas in the same location so all of the cousins can get to know each other.", "NTA\n\nIts your money. You're not required to spend it on anyone, especially if it causes financial distress.", "NTA\n\nMaybe a small gift as an alternative would be less expensive and more exciting to your young nephews?", "NTA in that nobody is entitled to your money, particularly without a relationship. However, how much money are we taking about here? If it's just a bit, it might pragmatically be worth it just to keep the peace. Does it impact your financial situation? What about just sending a card or some nice inexpensive gift?", "NTA. She may get mad, but she\u2019s not the one paying out extra for three children. When that happened with my cousins family (they have 6, I have 3), I just started getting a \u201chousehold gift\u201d like a $50 gift card to go towards whatever.", "NTA", "NTA: You just wanna focus on your family when money is tight and thts completely fair. Maybe just send them some cards every year with a nice message to let them know they are still thought about, but you dont have to send them money.", "NTA - but I would suggest sending a card for birthdays. Kids don't have control over who they get to see when family lives so far apart.", "Nta", "NTA Tell your sibling you prefer not to exchange birthday and Christmas gifts any longer between your families and bring up your suggestion of spending time together.", "NTA. You could always just cut what you send. Like $10 each.", "NTA. Money is tight. Your son is your priority. Simple as that. Don't give any weight to the entitled reactions of others. Make the responsible decision in the best interests of your child. Sometimes we have to choose. Stop letting other people's expectations stress you out.\n\nBy the way, no one should \"expect\" money from another person. Gifts are gestures of love when and if the giver feels inclined. They are not owed.", "A gift it just that a gift. It\u2019s not and should not be an obligation. I would just tell her, hey things are tight and I\u2019m no longer sending birthday and Christmas gifts. If she gets mad, that\u2019s her problem and her emotions that she needs to deal with. I don\u2019t know why people feel so obligated to give gifts. If you can\u2019t don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t. It\u2019s simple. NTA", "NTA. In my family we do the whole, I won't buy for you, you don't buy for me and we will wish each other Merry Christmas. It's less stressful and a lot cheaper.", "NTA you make an excellent point about the transactions of money here. Seeing as there is little to no relationship and the cousins don\u2019t even call each other all your basically doing is paying each other for having had kids and every year you get shorted a bit. \n\nI think sending the money for this year was the best way to avoid conflict. Instead of all of a sudden just refusing to send gifts, you\u2019re willing to do it one last Christmas. Once the stress and craziness of the holidays is finally over would probably be the best time to have this chat with your sister. Wait for the right time and I bet she\u2019ll agree that going forward there can be new expectations for the holidays next year.", "NTA, when my kids were born I became a SAHM so we told the family that we would not be buying gifts for the nieces and nephews or traveling for Christmas anymore. We didn't have the money and I wanted my kids to enjoy Christmas at home.\n\nSurprisingly, my SIL's were both in agreement as they didn't really want to buy for my kids either.\n\nWe all reached the agreement that we would buy for the nieces and nephews only if we were spending Christmas together - which ended up happening about every 5-6 years. \n\nAs soon as Christmas is over with bring it up to your sister so that she knows what's coming next year and isn't blindsided right before Christmas.", "NTA - Definitely suggest a meet up for an activity you could all enjoy, that makes much more sense than gift cards or impersonal items. You are also not the asshole for wanting there to be some sort of equity in the amount spent per family. One side constantly shouldering a much larger burden is not fair.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe you all can just exchange holiday cards instead, sans money (to show you\u2019re in each others\u2019 thoughts during these special days of the year). I think organizing family gatherings is a great idea, too.", "NTA\n\nJust say that going forward, let's limit gifts to occasions when we are celebrating together.", "The number of people, including OP, who think it's somehow unfair that sister has 3 kids and OP has one blows my mind. That's super petty.  This is your family, love should not be transactional.", "YTA.\n\nNot because you may not be able to afford it, if you can't afford it just be honest and tell your sister that you're in a financial situation where you can't afford it next year since you already did it this year.  But to be annoyed that you spend for 3 and she spends for 1 is quite petty.  You could easily stop sending money and send gifts that cut down on the costs.  Or send a gift card meant to treat all 3 kids out to lunch or something.   \n\nDon't you think she also spends 3 times as much for 3 kids as what you have to spend for 1?  That's extra mouths to feed, clothe, and everything else.   \n\nIf it were me, I'd just go to a store that has low cost items and get them something cool.   Maybe YOU should put in the effort to find out about their interests so you can get them appropriate gifts. \n\nOne kid is artistic?  Get them some art supplies (you can find them very cheap).  A kid is into a certain sport?  Get them something related to the sport (again find something inexpensive).  One kid is musical?  What instrument do they play?  You could get them the sheet music to a cool song in a genre they like.  It doesn't have to be money every year and it doesn't have to cost a whole lot.  Hell, you could order it to be delivered if you go to the right stores or shopping places online. Possibly free delivery depending on how much you spend.  \n\nLike seriously, instead of moaning about this, do something to make it less expensive while still acknowledging the kids as part of your family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just tell your sister you have decided to stop, you assume she will also stop and let her have her blow up and get over it. As you said, these kids are basically strangers to you, your family rarely see each other so I wouldn't feel obligated to send presents.", "NTA.  The giver decides who they want to give gifts to.  There should never be an expectation on the part of the receiver.  That changes it from a gift to a bill.  \n\nWhat my grandparents did, when they started getting more grandchildren than they could afford to send money to was have a cutoff age.  For them it was 12.  We all knew that once we turned 13, that was the end of the money.  I don't remember anyone complaining about that.", "NTA \n\nYou mention you getting nephews presents. Does SIL get your child anything? \n\n\nNo matter what, presents are not a requirement.", "Nta but this Christmas should be the end of it. If you are unable to spend extra money on people you don't know well, then stop doing it. If there is no relationship between yourself & your sister there is no reason to continue the charade of loving family relationship.", "You're NTA. You could send your sister a letter to let her know that due to circumstances being the way they are for people because of the pandemic,and that you've been affected,  this was the last year you could send them money for their birthdays and Christmas, as you have a duty to your immediate family's welfare, and to kindly please not expect it to resume.", "NTA", "Thanks everyone for the help. Lots of great ideas! I appreciate it!", "INFO: Do you go out to visit them?", "Edit:  I agree with this.", "You could also stop sending it one kid at the time.\nSince the oldest is currently 14 and will receive a gift this year, make 14 the cut off date.\nNext year don't send anything to the one that will then be 15, but still send something to the other 2, so that they receive gifts for the same amount of time.\nP.s.

Sister hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.", "Maybe a bucket of popcorn for the whole family.", "OP already said that money is tight and that he would like to redirect the money to family necessities.", ">This is your family, love should not be transactional.\n\nThen sister shouldn't be upset if the transaction is cancelled.", "Love isn't transactional, but modern holiday consumerism sure is. One side being burdened *forever* with that kind of imbalance is not fair. And if you think your relatives don't notice, or don't mind, you are fooling yourself.", "Being upfront is what I mean. It sounded to me like OP wants to opt out *in general*, not just this year when money is tight. I suppose it would change things if he wants to just stop this year and resume again in different financial times, that's just not the impression I got.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like OP wants to continue gifting his three regardless of finances, sincere they don\u2019t really have a relationship with him or his child.", "That's a fair point.  It's unfortunate that they don't have a relationship,  but there might be very good reasons why OP and their sibling are distant with one another.", "Yea, but I was verifying that wasn't just sort of an expression of principle. It seems strange to be sending a large enough amount to your nephews that it would affect your finances.", "Since I have no children, the \"financial\" imbalance has always been against me and in favor of my relatives, which never bothered me at all.  By your logic, I should never give any of my nieces or nephews gifts of any kind, since I have no children to receive gifts and make the equation equal.  What a sad way of looking at the world and one's own family.", "After rereading the post, I think you\u2019re right. He doesn\u2019t wanna send any more money, period!\nBut if he thinks his sister is going to \u201cblowup\u201c over this, I highly doubt she will agree to a play date.", "NAH. Your sister may even feel the same way, as she has to send Christmas and birthday money every year for a nephew she barely knows.", "Yes, I have realized that now. And likely his sister feels the same way about the OP\u2019s child.", "They live five hours apart.", "It didn\u2019t affect his finances before. Now it does, which is why he no longer wants to send it.", "Yes, but my sister and I live 14 hours apart and we are quite close anyway.  We talk, we visit, our kids are quite close....", "Yes, I read the post. To me, \"money is tight now, so these small gifts irk me\" is just as likely an interpretation of his meaning as \"these gifts are going to cause me to downgrade to a different apartment.\" \n\nYou think the second sort of thing was the obvious intent. That's fine. You might be right. That's why I asked.", "You don\u2019t have to explain yourself to me :)", "Haha sounds good. Hopefully I wasn't being defensive."]}
