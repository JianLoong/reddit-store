My parents were just not willing to pay a fortune for her to go to school only for her not to take her studies seriously.

I pointed out that she was the favorite child, since even during my birthday trip to Japan, she was the one being followed which meant i didn\u2019t get to do what I wanted to do. \n\nMy sister started crying telling me that I don\u2019t deserve anything and I should apologize to her for lying about her.

They clearly chose a side and it wasn't yours. They're your sister's friends.\n\n\nNTA. And you'll make your own friends in your college. Good for you! Congrats.", "I feel you. But I think ESH, with a soft one for OP. \n\nI know it sucks to have her talk about you the way she does. Passive aggressive from her, but then when you get directly aggressive people point fingers at who looks like the bad guy. Instead of getting your point they get defensive. It\u2019s frustrating but it\u2019s kinda normal. \n\nYour sister is frustrated to not get her dream uni. You parents needed to make a choice. It sucks. It\u2019s normal if she\u2019s pissed. Her attitude shows that she doesn\u2019t know who to be mad at and she probably has those emotions and didn\u2019t know how to deal with them so she blames you. Not an adult nor a big sister\u2019s attitude. \n\nI get that it\u2019s annoying but not saying anything to build it all up then blow up on her face is probably not the way to go. I understand though. Yet there\u2019s probably more into it than just \u00ab\u00a0it\u2019s your fault if I can\u2019t go\u00a0\u00bb. I would try to listen to her and let her vent. Of course it feels like she\u2019s being rejected, of course it feels like you\u2019re the preferred child. \n\nPeople make mistakes, she\u2019s has her flaws, so do you. Yet she wants to grow and succeed just the way you do, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t even consider studies. I would support her in her sadness but still calmly discuss hard truths she needs to hear. I know it doesn\u2019t feel right cause you\u2019re the lil one but it does seem like you\u2019re capable of doing so, so why the fuck not? \n\nYour parents put trust in your brilliant life ahead. Make em proud (but be happy).", "School is expensive af, and we won\u2019t have access to our college fund unless our parents approve of our school.

They rightfully snapped on WHY the sister wasn't going to a different university.", "I agree.", "That part about public vs private acceptance is just factually incorrect. Who told you this? I\u2019m sorry but it sounds like your parents are screwing you both over and you should be both be doing more research on your own.", "\uff29agree 2", "We\u2019re not from the US so its different in our country. Here State universities are really hard to get into, having exams so difficult that majority don\u2019t pass. We have done research and due to our financial situation neither my sister or I are eligible for financial aid. Student loans are not a thing in our country and even if we do become working students in order to try to pay for school, its just not possible. That\u2019s just the norm in our country and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
