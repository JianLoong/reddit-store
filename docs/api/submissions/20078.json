But I think ESH, with a soft one for OP. \n\nI know it sucks to have her talk about you the way she does. Passive aggressive from her, but then when you get directly aggressive people point fingers at who looks like the bad guy. Instead of getting your point they get defensive.

Her attitude shows that she doesn\u2019t know who to be mad at and she probably has those emotions and didn\u2019t know how to deal with them so she blames you. Not an adult nor a big sister\u2019s attitude. \n\nI get that it\u2019s annoying but not saying anything to build it all up then blow up on her face is probably not the way to go.

Yet she wants to grow and succeed just the way you do, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t even consider studies. I would support her in her sadness but still calmly discuss hard truths she needs to hear.
