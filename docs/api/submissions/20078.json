{"id": 20078, "submission_id": "14dm7lj", "title": "AITA for snapping at my sister and making her cry during dinner?", "selftext": "Context: I (18f) have always been seen as the more responsible child over my sister (20f). I could always balance my social life and my academics well, which led my to being a great student ambassador and an honors student while still enjoying high school parties and the likes. My sister on the other hand does not have the same balance and has often had parties take priority over school which has made my parents lose some trust in her. \n\nMy sister was only allowed by my parents to stay at the best private university in our city, while I have just been allowed to attend the most prestigious university in our country. My sister has been ranting and complaining about this, even going so far as saying that my parents have favorites and its not her. At some point, she stopped talking about my parents and instead started talking about how entitled and spoiled I was for going to my dream school and leaving our city. \n\nI let it slide because I know that she had a right to be mad since I was allowed into my dream school while she wasn\u2019t, but her comments started getting worse and one night at dinner, as she was ranting to our common friends, I just snapped. \n\nI told her that her irresponsibility in high school was the cause of our parents not trusting her and it is not my fault that she lost her chance to go to her dream school. My parents were just not willing to pay a fortune for her to go to school only for her not to take her studies seriously. I told her if anything, she was the spoiled one in our situation because this year, I am the GRADUATE yet all I\u2019ve gotten was headphones while she has gotten a new iPad, a room makeover, and an increase in allowance she doesn\u2019t even need. I pointed out that she was the favorite child, since even during my birthday trip to Japan, she was the one being followed which meant i didn\u2019t get to do what I wanted to do. \n\nMy sister started crying telling me that I don\u2019t deserve anything and I should apologize to her for lying about her. I refuse to apologize for stating facts, but our friends have been telling me that it was an asshole move to refuse apologizing causing my sister to continue crying and humiliating herself in public. AITA?\n\nedit (bc apparently i dont give enough info)\n\n1.) Just read through all the comments, I am not from India, I am from the Philippines. \n\n2.) My sister is in a PreMed course, Pharmacy, and I am an incoming freshman in Management Engineering. \n\n3.) My sister attends SLU, a well known top school for Medicine. Her dream school is UST, one of the Philippine\u2019s Ivy schools and a good Med school too. I am entering Ateneo De Manila which is one of the highest ranking schools in the country. \n\n4.) My sister is not a bad student. She has been my role model and my best friend since birth. She just doesn\u2019t know how to balance her studies with her social life. She gets Bs and Cs which are good grades in her school and her course, but in the eyes of our parents it is not good enough. The stereotype that Asian parents want straight As is very real, nothing we can do about that. Even with Ba and Cs, my parents encouraged my sister to fix her papers for transfer to UST (her dream school) during her second semester, my sister refused to do the work. They tried again this year when I was applying for college, she refused yet again. \n\n5.) After getting into a top school in an honors course, I do believe I have the right to be proud of myself. I have avoided talking too much about my plans for school around our family because I know that my sister is jealous. I didn\u2019t even post anything like my friends did just to be respectful. My sister, in all her wisdom, said that I cheated in my entrance test and did not deserve a slot in any school I got into. That hurt, its what made me snap, and in the end it\u2019s what made me talk back to my sister. \n\n6.) Y\u2019all really think you know a person online. My sister and I come from a well off family and we are both spoiled, but we are equally supposed to be given things. My comment about the headphones, iPad, and Japan stem from this fact. I got headphones for my graduation gift, while my sister got a new iPad. Price-wise, its not even close which is what made me pissed. I graduated, yet I get the smaller gift??? My dad has since talked to me about it and he said it was unfair so I will be getting a new iPad too, while my sister is getting the speakers she has been asking for. Japan is a mixed bag, because 18th birthdays are a big thing in the Philippines and I gave up a grand party to ask for a trip to Japan. Its been a long time dream of mine to go to USJ for Harry Potter World, and my sister ruined that when she convinced my parents to get passes for Disney instead. I love my sister which is why most of the time I just let things go but sometimes things blow up when you hold onto them for so long. \n\nupdates:\n\nI\u2019ve talked to my sister like some have suggested. She told me majority of her comments stem from the fact she doesn\u2019t want me to leave because she doesn\u2019t know how to do the responsibilities I have at home. I\u2019ve offered to teach her so we\u2019ll see how that goes. She still wants me to apologize because she humiliated herself in public, but I told her it made things even because she was humiliating me too with her comments. We are fighting about that now but honestly we\u2019ll both get over it.", "created_utc": 1687198701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dm7lj/aita_for_snapping_at_my_sister_and_making_her_cry/", "score": 928, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've never seen a more snobby post.", "Sorry the truth hurts.", "AMEN!!!!!!!.", "This is the most sane comment in here.", "Didn't she say she was 18?", "Go reread some of OPs comments, in the original post she fails to mention that the older sis is in a more academically weighted program. Heres the comment: \nWhen I say barely getting good grades, I mean that she is barely passing the minimum grade requirement for her program. Passing is good especially at her school because it is well known for not being student friendly.The Bs and Cs she gets here will translate differently to her dream school.  Shes claiming bs and cs in advanced course is less than her As in a less stringent program. If your american think older sis is taking AP vs reg track and trying to say shes better . The more I read her comments the more I think that OP is the golden child and their friend group sees it .", "That's why Sis didn't get to go to state university but had to settle for a private one, like OP. And of those private ones, OP got to go to a better one, because their parents trusted her to behave  responsible even far away, while not trusting Sis the same way: Sis might go to the better uni far away, party it up all the time, and _not_ get (or give her parents) any return on their money in the form of actually getting an education out of it.\n\nIOW, \u201cIf sis qualified for the school, and assuming she continues to\u201d is a pretty huge assumption without any particular foundation. Why would you assume that?", ">> barely getting good grades\n\n> But... she's still getting good grades...\n\nExactly: \u201cBarely good\u201d, not great.", "Considering the fact that my sister is still pursuing her desired program at her current school, one of the top schools for her program, she\u2019s been set up for success.

So to compare shes taking advanced course and getting bs and cst as compared to you in a regular course getting A's? You must not understand how college metrics and advanced programs work comparatively. Your really starting to sound like the golden child here and your parents are showing favoritism thus her resentment your friends see it but often the golden child wont.", "Which is why the parents decided not to finance studies at a far-away one for her, but instead pay for her to study at a local one where they can (at least try to) make sure she studies some too, in stead of just partying their money away. Seems eminently sensible, doesn't it?", "Yeah, no, you did kind of misinterpret the situation: In India, as opposed to the US, it appears the state-run universities are the fancier (\u201cIvy League\u201d) ones, while private ones are second-tier.\n\nNeither of the sisters qualified for state, OP got sent to a somewhat fancier private one farther away because parents trusted her to actually study unsupervised by them, Sis got to settle for a less fancy local one because they didn't trust her the same way after how she did in high school.\n\nNo Golden Child needed, just simple accountability for one's own behaviour.", "I just graduated high school so I don\u2019t know where you got that I\u2019m in a regular course getting As??? Never said anything about me getting into a regular course too \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Never compared my grades to my sister, I\u2019ve taken specialization in Business since my junior year of hs while she has always been more interested in Sciences.

Was just typing fast on mobile \ud83e\udd13", "Ugh the disgust after piecing together the whole story since you left out quite a bit of pertinent info in th original post. \n1. You failed to mention your sister is in a widely known academically rigorous program for PRE MED in the number 1 program in the country !!!! Vs OPs Honor Math and Business. .Older sis is passing with Bs and Cs that's hardly failing and because I'm now shaking in absolute disgust Op just comment this :/\nShe\u2019s in a premed, I\u2019m in an honors Math and Business course. As I\u2019ve said, I don\u2019t like to compare my sister and I because we have different likes and its not fair to compare the sciences from business. Truth of the matter is, since you seem not to realize, is that my sister was given the chance to transfer wherever she wanted to go, she just didn\u2019t want to work for it.

I got into a 1% school into a course that only takes the top 10% of applicants, I worked hard for that so I will defend myself if necessary.// \n\nThat whole comment reveals the truth right there. So what if I paint myself in better light? How tf you gonna ask for an accurate assessment but skew the data. OP you are one of the biggest AH I have ever ran across on reddit . You are quite clearly the golden child your parents are ah to and I feel so bad for your sister. Your friends knew the truth so you came seeking validation from strangers by leaving out the whole truth of the situation Massive YTA !!!!!!", "Oh she did  you might want to re read her comments she left out some HUGE bits of detail to this story and admits it. At one point after outing that sisters actually getting bs and cs in the most rigorous PreMed program in the country (Ironically she still hasn't said what her grades are in her honors math and business) she states verbatim:\"So what if I am painting myself in a \u201cbetter\u201d light ?\"  Like wtf . Poor older sis.", "I think most people are primed to see whoever is crying as the victim and the person they have angered as the aggressor.  Crying = poor baby.  Anger = you should control yourself better, you monster.  \n\nThis is why emotional manipulators turn on the waterworks as their go-to maneuver rather than the fireworks.", "Or they had the relevant information OP left out.

Do I really need to say more?", "Go read OPs comments she left out alot of relevant information those friends have that we didnt.", "OP is not telling the whole truth go check her comments and see if you feel the same.", "Because her friends know the whole truth ad op leaves out some very pertinent facts in the original post. Go read her comments and this situation takes a whole new light I particularly think this quote from OP changes the whole tune :  \"So what if I am painting myself in a \u201cbetter\u201d light ?\" Always ask questions before making judgement and if a large group of people who know someone personally are all saying the same thing that's a sign that somethings off", "And she has taken extended liberties when it comes to crying about the unfairness of it all (if it is unfair). You're entitled to air yours, too.", "Yea go reread ops comments she left out some major pertinent information. Sis is in the #1 PreMed program in the country making bs and cs.

Your so haughty that your still saying your high school business grade as an A. Is you working diligently but your sisters Bs and Cs In the #1 PreMed COLLEGE program is her slacking off ? Gtfo. And if you truly didnt want to compare you wouldnt have made this post. Your poor immature golden child ego got hurt and you had to come seeking validation from internet strangers by LYING to them. And lying by ommision is still lying.", "Oh and since your a freshman you'll learn this soon college has a lot more work involved that isnt equated into a grade. The reality is your sister could be doing 3x the work your doing and still not make an A.

And my sister is not in the #1 Premed college, I said she is in a top school known for medicine. I POSTED AT 2AM, while i was crying my eyes out because my sister said I deserve nothing, so I missed a few things. I HAVE ADDED THEM IN MY POST IN EDITS. AGAIN, Asian country, we live in a culture where not getting As means you are a failure, even if you passed. I said that my sister is getting good grades considering where she is, and that is true, but I cannot change an entire country\u2019s mindset about grades. I keep telling you, you cannot compare my grades with my sister, BUSINESS is far from SCIENCE, you are the on constantly trying to compare the two when I never did.", "Quote where I said she slacked??? I said she doesn\u2019t have a good balance between school and her social life, never said anything about her slacking?????", "You cant even keep up with your lies at this point.

You came asking for judgment well now you have it YTA.", "But OP fails to mention in original post that sis is in a widely recognized academically stringent program for sciences making bs and cs(in OPs words barely passing) vs her own business track but sidestepped revealing her own grades .

Your entitlement is clearly showing now especially with that snark. If anything the fact that she is doing decent in a difficult program and your still snubbing her is telling in and of itself.
