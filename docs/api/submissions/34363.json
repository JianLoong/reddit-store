If gf's friend is a software engineer, why would she refuse the certificate? Certificate-based authentication is standard business in most corporate environments, particularly tech companies. It's also common knowledge that any access point can be monitored. Do you have some relationship issues with this friend?\n2. Have you ever monitored anyone's activity on your network as the CA server?\n3. Why is your gf so gullible and scared *of you* if you live together?\n\nI feel like there has to be more backstory here, otherwise this is bizarre beyond words. More INFO please.\n\nEDIT: based on better understanding of the tech setup, YTA based on a few things:   \n1) You have not communicated enough about the nature of your setup to your gf. Even if she was okay with the lack of data / Internet privacy your setup affords, it seems she could not (or did not) give conformed consent. Given you are the more knowledgeable one here, and it's your setup, that's your fault.\n\n2)  Asking your gf's friend to step in to do your work for you to explain your setup. Even if you were not \"lying\" in the sense you are not spying on her, you've almost certainly lied by omission. Your gf's friend was right to refuse the certificate / connection. It's on you to communicate to your gf your reasoning and fix the issue YOU created with your setup / repair any trust breech.\n\n3) Just have a guest network man, I feel like it's almost willfully obtuse to expect random friends or acquaintances (not your gf) in your house to sign up to such invasive privacy.", "Personally I would not use your setup as it sounds like a perfect man in the middle setup.  I always have a guest network that allows traffic firewalled from my internals.  Friend sounds like she understands with your mitm setup her traffic is not secure from you.", "YTA. \n\nYou should know better than this man, set up a guest network already and let people use the internet freely while containing them from your homelab network.\n\nHer software engineer friend wasn't making shit up and you know it, you not currently doing it doesn't mean it's not possible. Respect people's privacy and understand that it's not about if you did do it or not, it's about relinquishing that privacy in the first place.\n\nYou don't need to inspect the packets of guests for viruses, just let them do what they want on their own VLAN and forget about it.", "YTA. not for your security but for your reaction to their reaction and your demands for the friend to say she was \"making stuff up\".\n\nSecurity and freedom are a slider and as one goes up the other goes down, the more secure you make your home network the less \"free\" it is, the purpose of your security might not be to track your GF, but it would certainly make it easier for your to do so if you were so inclined.", "Eh, gonna go with YTA\n\nIt does seem weird what you\u2019ve done. I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with it either. \n\nYou can monitor her internet usage? Yikes, I\u2019d be outta there", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not like she was telling your GF the 5g in the router's giving her cancer or something\n\nEveryone's reactions seem to suggest you have a communication issue. Instead of reassuring SE friend and/or GF, you, presumably, threw accusations and told SE friend what to do. Reasonable open communication is always the better route \n\nNTA for the initial network setup at least", "NTA. I would look into why your girlfriend distrusts you (although from a non-tech savvy POV, I could understand why she would trust a friend about this also in tech)", "NTA but why does your gf automatically believe what her friend says about you instead of what you say and why is she so scared of you tracking what she\u2019s looking at?\n\nThat\u2019s the real story here.", "YTA and she's right to be creeped out.", "I would say NAH, but if it's that big of a deal to you and you're as knowledgeable as you say you are, then why not set up subnets or some form of a guest network? Then, individuals such as your girlfriends friend, or even your GF, could use the internet freely without feeling any threats of having their privacy compromised. You can keep the high security network up for your personal projects and whatnot and lighten up the burden on all of your normie friends.\n\nAs a software dev myself, I find your position a bit excessive for guests but I do understand taking internet security seriously. Most people won't even begin to understand your position though so you should really expect people to be put off by what you're asking here.", "[deleted]", "NTA, your home your internet, your rules, dont like it use your own mobile internet.", "Just relax the security then. For whatever reason, she believes someone else over you. So what you're doing isn't something she's comfortable with or understands.\n\nYou don't deny that you could do everything the friend suggests, you just seem to think it isn't an issue. So YTA for acting all shocked at your GF's concern.", "Your NTA as long as you don\u2019t monitor any activity that is happening on your network. If you ever do, whether it be curiosity or distrust, you would be an asshole.

I don't think she is wrong to not want the certificate on her devices. \n\nBecause essentially how this works makes your computer think the corporate proxy is the server for say Facebook and communicstes with it with my certificate which I can use to decrypt as I have the private key. Then my server uses the actual certificate for Facebook to get the information and sends it back to her computer.", "This is probably the right take, an open guest network you don\u2019t use it easy to set up", "But she was making shit up. Anyone with a router can track anyone who connects to it.", "Dude.\n\nAnyone can easily monitor home internet usage without going to the (rather paranoid) step of messing with certificates.\n\nAnyone who's set up network-wide adblocking on something as cheap as a Raspberry Pi can get a good idea what's going on. Anyone nefarious would simply install a keylogger on an client machine.\n\nOP sounds a bit OTT paranoid, but if he was trying to be a stalker, there are far, far easier ways of going about it.\n\nAlthough one has to wonder why there's not just a guest wifi network set up for exactly such an occasion. It requires zero work.", "Anyone can monitor wifi usage with an online account with your internet provider, just saying", "It is just a firewall with a proxy for security. Almost all large companies with corporate networks do this and install certificates on their own devices.\n\nEssentially all it does is send a secure encrypted connection to my network system instead of directly with the website directly communicating with your computer.", "To be fair anyone connecting to an internet access point can be tracked.

They also often have a guest network you can connect your personal device to so traffic on your personal device isn't monitored.  \n\nAnd that's not all it does.

Just because others leave themselves open to cyber attacks doesnt mean you should. This is like people getting mad that the husband bought a gun to protect his family. Gtfo the 2nd ammendment is there for a reason. All it is,is the system checking to make sure you have the certificates before you can send packets over the network. (I dont know the ins and outs of what you did im a layman) but i understand the principle.", "You can typically track which servers someone communicates with but not the communication itself. This system allows go inspect suspicious usage patterns and viruses etc.", "Which means while the purpose might not be to spy on her you undoubtedly are getting the same results as if you were.\n\nThat level of security means you are tracking her internet activity even if that's not the purpose of implementing it.", "That\u2019s the problem.", "Everyone should be entitled to privacy in how they browse the web, who they talk to, what they say, and just in all avenues of life. Having privacy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re hiding something.", "I'm not really sure why tbh, she has no evidence of me ever trying to inspect her usage. I guess it is because she didn't realise it has this capability till now.", "I operate servers and other projects for my personal needs and need a secure network.", "Look dude, I'm basically tech support for my entire family. If someone even connects to my wifi, if I wanted to I can log in to my router and see everything everyone is doing. And that isn't something I set up, that's just how the router works.

Bro go post this in a subreddit about  cybersecurity so people dont act all weird.", "Of course you're right.\n\nIt just is odd that OP's gf would be AFRAID to go on the Internet as a result of these communications, unless she's very ignorant about how Internet privacy works. Or she would communicate with OP directly about her concerns. It shouldn\u2019t be a mystery at this point to OP how gf is feeling (not sure why he isn\u2019t communicating with her directly).\n\nShe should be far more afraid of going online at her local library or Starbucks than at home.\n\nA normal reaction to a friend saying \"He could look at all your web traffic with his security settings\" would be \"But I trust my boyfriend, he doesn't look through my phone or ask invasive questions about my life and whereabouts. That seems really unlikely.\"\n\nBut as others have said I see the point around OP\u2019s gf learning rather abruptly she did not have privacy she thought she had, and that alone could be upsetting even without nefarious intent.", "Based on what you said here, NTA, though you have a communication issue. Don't involve this friend, talk to your gf and figure out what her concerns are.\n\nIf she believes you are doing something nefarious without evidence beyond the existence of higher security and whatever this friend is speculating, then there's something bigger going on.", "Yeah no the other guys right you have no idea what you're talking about. You can't view the contents of a packet that's been transmitted over your network just by logging into your ISP's pre-configured modem-router man that's just not how it works. There are security controls in place to prevent you from doing exactly that.", "From my perspective, having had who I thought were reasonable, respectful men turn out to be total creeps... the guy installed what could extremely easily be used as very invasive spyware on all her devices without bothering to mention it. If he was snooping, he wouldn't need to ask invasive questions or look through her phone physically.", "good advice for literally any salvageable AITA post, communicate. Solves so many problems, or at least identifies the actual problem to then be worked on.", "[deleted]", "Her BF has been oversimplfying to the extent where she couldn't have given informed consent to what he was installing on her devices. And yes, it's always a risk that someone's snooping on your internet traffic. It's also always possible someone hacked your phone and is tracking it's GPS location. That doesn't make it less creepy if your BF puts a GPS tracker in your car without telling you. Someone could do that, never looked at the location data, and intend it to be there in case of emergency or car theft. It'd still be a huge violation for them to do such a thing without consent.  \n\nGF's friend refuses to install a cert for something that is frequently used to act as spyware, friend explains why she's refusing to install it, and that's how the GF learns what his setup actually does. Did the friend say he was some sort of creep, or did she say something to the effect of \"there's no way I'm installing, it's effectively spyware\"? Because that'd be an accurate thing to say. That's not saying he's a \"secret creep\". And it doesn't take having some sort of trauma from some creep to get freaked out over realizing what her BF did without informing her.  \n\nBlaming the friend for OP's lack of communication is not reasonable. It's not a communication problem on her end, either, but on his. I get all he probably did is not communicate clearly and not react well when she got upset about it. But he massively violated her trust by doing so.", "Everything you say makes sense but I\u2019m just not following how this equates to a \u201cmassive violation of trust\u201d based purely on the information given. But maybe I\u2019m putting too much on OP\u2019s stated intent (or lack thereof) and not giving enough credence to the initial conversations leading up to the gf downloading the certs.\n\nI do see where you\u2019re coming from though, and agree that this seems to be an issue of incomplete or poor communication, which should be solved by OP (and also the dude should just set up a guest network and bypass this).", "I am sure that as a network engineer you quite understand the implications of someone doing MITM on your traffic. This is what your gfs software engineer friend is pointing out. Their concern is that you may be abusing this to spy on her. Rightfully so. YTA. There is no need to do deep packet inspection on clients that have nothing to do with your server setup. Just separate the traffic.", "YTA. Also you don't seem to believe your GF's friend knows what she's saying even though she's a software engineer, is that because she's a woman?", "YTA you're doing a man in the middle attack.

It's just that you are claiming that you didn't watch the video.", "YTA. Ime corporations do use this kind of proxy *so they can monitor internet traffic more thoroughly*. The companies I've known to have a proxy set up like this had bypasses for banking sites so they wouldn't interfere/capture that data if people decided it was a good idea to log into their banking on a corporate device. You have your reasons, but you're not a trusted enough authority by the people around you. You could use it to spy, but that doesn't mean you do or people can trust you not to. In a relationship, you may not now, but she doesn't necessarily know it'll stay that way if things turn sour or you think she's cheating. It introduces an extra Damocles sword to the relationship. \n\nI agree a guest network would be the way to go. If I was needing a proxy cert for a non-corporate machine, I'd use my mobile internet, thanks. Wifis I don't trust I have a VPN I can use.
