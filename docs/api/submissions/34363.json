If gf's friend is a software engineer, why would she refuse the certificate? Certificate-based authentication is standard business in most corporate environments, particularly tech companies. It's also common knowledge that any access point can be monitored. Do you have some relationship issues with this friend?\n2. Have you ever monitored anyone's activity on your network as the CA server?\n3. Why is your gf so gullible and scared *of you* if you live together?\n\nI feel like there has to be more backstory here, otherwise this is bizarre beyond words. More INFO please.", "Personally I would not use your setup as it sounds like a perfect man in the middle setup.  I always have a guest network that allows traffic firewalled from my internals.  Friend sounds like she understands with your mitm setup her traffic is not secure from you.", "YTA. \n\nYou should know better than this man, set up a guest network already and let people use the internet freely while containing them from your homelab network.\n\nHer software engineer friend wasn't making shit up and you know it, you not currently doing it doesn't mean it's not possible. Respect people's privacy and understand that it's not about if you did do it or not, it's about relinquishing that privacy in the first place.\n\nYou don't need to inspect the packets of guests for viruses, just let them do what they want on their own VLAN and forget about it.", "YTA. not for your security but for your reaction to their reaction and your demands for the friend to say she was \"making stuff up\".\n\nSecurity and freedom are a slider and as one goes up the other goes down, the more secure you make your home network the less \"free\" it is, the purpose of your security might not be to track your GF, but it would certainly make it easier for your to do so if you were so inclined.", "Eh, gonna go with YTA\n\nIt does seem weird what you\u2019ve done.

YTA, revert to a more standard security.", "YTA\n\nThis sounds excessive to me.", "\"My girlfriend now scared to use the Internet so I called her friend and told her she needs to tell her she was making stuff up\" - software engineer here, I'd be sus as heck if someone wanted me to install software to be able to use their network. It's not like she was telling your GF the 5g in the router's giving her cancer or something\n\nEveryone's reactions seem to suggest you have a communication issue. Instead of reassuring SE friend and/or GF, you, presumably, threw accusations and told SE friend what to do. Reasonable open communication is always the better route \n\nNTA for the initial network setup at least", "NTA. I would look into why your girlfriend distrusts you (although from a non-tech savvy POV, I could understand why she would trust a friend about this also in tech)", "NTA but why does your gf automatically believe what her friend says about you instead of what you say and why is she so scared of you tracking what she\u2019s looking at?\n\nThat\u2019s the real story here.", "YTA and she's right to be creeped out.", "I would say NAH, but if it's that big of a deal to you and you're as knowledgeable as you say you are, then why not set up subnets or some form of a guest network? Then, individuals such as your girlfriends friend, or even your GF, could use the internet freely without feeling any threats of having their privacy compromised. You can keep the high security network up for your personal projects and whatnot and lighten up the burden on all of your normie friends.\n\nAs a software dev myself, I find your position a bit excessive for guests but I do understand taking internet security seriously. Most people won't even begin to understand your position though so you should really expect people to be put off by what you're asking here.", "Seems weird that she defaults to believing her friend over you. Also what the fuck does she have to worry about? Weird but NTA...", "NTA, your home your internet, your rules, dont like it use your own mobile internet.", "Just relax the security then. For whatever reason, she believes someone else over you. So what you're doing isn't something she's comfortable with or understands.\n\nYou don't deny that you could do everything the friend suggests, you just seem to think it isn't an issue. So YTA for acting all shocked at your GF's concern.", "Your NTA as long as you don\u2019t monitor any activity that is happening on your network. If you ever do, whether it be curiosity or distrust, you would be an asshole. I understand where she is coming from, with not wanting to be tracked; however, if your gf trusts you, then why is this an issue?", "NTA. If you were trying to spy on her, you could just as easily do so in a way where it wouldn\u2019t raise red flags with all these extra steps.\n\nBut\u2026 just set up a guest network ffs.", "NTA your gf just doesn\u2019t understand and most likely the friend doesn\u2019t fully comprehend either despite her position or thinks you\u2019re overdoing it.", "NTA", "1. I don't think she is wrong to not want the certificate on her devices. \n\nBecause essentially how this works makes your computer think the corporate proxy is the server for say Facebook and communicstes with it with my certificate which I can use to decrypt as I have the private key. Then my server uses the actual certificate for Facebook to get the information and sends it back to her computer.", "This is probably the right take, an open guest network you don\u2019t use it easy to set up", "But she was making shit up. Anyone with a router can track anyone who connects to it.", "Dude.\n\nAnyone can easily monitor home internet usage without going to the (rather paranoid) step of messing with certificates.\n\nAnyone who's set up network-wide adblocking on something as cheap as a Raspberry Pi can get a good idea what's going on. Anyone nefarious would simply install a keylogger on an client machine.\n\nOP sounds a bit OTT paranoid, but if he was trying to be a stalker, there are far, far easier ways of going about it.\n\nAlthough one has to wonder why there's not just a guest wifi network set up for exactly such an occasion. It requires zero work.", "Anyone can monitor wifi usage with an online account with your internet provider, just saying", "It is just a firewall with a proxy for security. Almost all large companies with corporate networks do this and install certificates on their own devices.\n\nEssentially all it does is send a secure encrypted connection to my network system instead of directly with the website directly communicating with your computer.", "To be fair anyone connecting to an internet access point can be tracked. Thats why I refuse to use the company issued wifi.", "I have some servers I run to share content between people and participate in some activism and run services used by people like whistle-blower etc", "He\u2019s the AH for being a little word about his internet huh. Not the one that\u2019s lying. Got. OP, NTA. A little strange, but you\u2019re not the bad guy.", "It's normal that people would believe their friends over their partners.", "His home, his internet, her computer he installed spyware on", "Ah I see. \n\nBut why is your gf still scared to use the internet if ultimately the person who she'd hypothetically be \"unsafe\" from is... you? \n\n...is it possible that, upon learning you could see her private communication, there's something she might not... want you to see? Hence the fear?", "Most companies with corporate networks also restrict, log, and monitor traffic on those devices. They also often have a guest network you can connect your personal device to so traffic on your personal device isn't monitored.  \n\nAnd that's not all it does. I'm sure that's all you're using it for, but your GF's friend probably explained why she was rejecting the cert and your GF freaked out because you told her your version of \"all it does\".", "Your girlfriend doesn\u2019t live in a large company. \n\nThis sounds excessive.", "Im with you here. Just because others leave themselves open to cyber attacks doesnt mean you should. This is like people getting mad that the husband bought a gun to protect his family. Gtfo the 2nd ammendment is there for a reason. All it is,is the system checking to make sure you have the certificates before you can send packets over the network. (I dont know the ins and outs of what you did im a layman) but i understand the principle.", "You can typically track which servers someone communicates with but not the communication itself. This system allows go inspect suspicious usage patterns and viruses etc.", "Which means while the purpose might not be to spy on her you undoubtedly are getting the same results as if you were.\n\nThat level of security means you are tracking her internet activity even if that's not the purpose of implementing it.", "That\u2019s the problem.", "Everyone should be entitled to privacy in how they browse the web, who they talk to, what they say, and just in all avenues of life. Having privacy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re hiding something.", "I'm not really sure why tbh, she has no evidence of me ever trying to inspect her usage. I guess it is because she didn't realise it has this capability till now.", "I operate servers and other projects for my personal needs and need a secure network.", "Look dude, I'm basically tech support for my entire family. If someone even connects to my wifi, if I wanted to I can log in to my router and see everything everyone is doing. And that isn't something I set up, that's just how the router works. And from my experience that's how a majority of routers work. That's how internet access works.\n\nI'm not gonna argue with you about this because from the very tone of your post you appear to have an attitude about this and don't believe you're wrong.", "A bunch of people pretending they have any idea whats going on. Bro go post this in a subreddit about  cybersecurity so people dont act all weird.", "Of course you're right. I just asked if it was possible, given how disproportionate the gf's reaction is.\n\nIt just is odd that OP's gf would be AFRAID to go on the Internet as a result of these communications, unless she's very ignorant about how Internet privacy works. Or she would communicate with OP directly about her concerns.\n\nShe should be far more afraid of going online at her local library or Starbucks than at home.\n\nA normal reaction to a friend saying \"He could look at all your web traffic with his security settings\" would be \"But I trust my boyfriend, he doesn't look through my phone or ask invasive questions about my life and whereabouts. That seems really unlikely.\"\n\nNot... being afraid to go on the Internet in your own home.", "Based on what you said here, NTA, though you have a communication issue. Don't involve this friend, talk to your gf and figure out what her concerns are.\n\nIf she believes you are doing something nefarious without evidence beyond the existence of higher security and whatever this friend is speculating, then there's something bigger going on.", "Yeah no the other guys right you have no idea what you're talking about. You can't view the contents of a packet that's been transmitted over your network just by logging into your ISP's pre-configured modem-router man that's just not how it works. There are security controls in place to prevent you from doing exactly that.", "From my perspective, having had who I thought were reasonable, respectful men turn out to be total creeps... the guy installed what could extremely easily be used as very invasive spyware on all her devices without bothering to mention it. If he was snooping, he wouldn't need to ask invasive questions or look through her phone physically.", "good advice for literally any salvageable AITA post, communicate. Solves so many problems, or at least identifies the actual problem to then be worked on.", "[deleted]", "Her BF has been oversimplfying to the extent where she couldn't have given informed consent to what he was installing on her devices. And yes, it's always a risk that someone's snooping on your internet traffic. It's also always possible someone hacked your phone and is tracking it's GPS location. That doesn't make it less creepy if your BF puts a GPS tracker in your car without telling you. Someone could do that, never looked at the location data, and intend it to be there in case of emergency or car theft. It'd still be a huge violation for them to do such a thing without consent.  \n\nGF's friend refuses to install a cert for something that is frequently used to act as spyware, friend explains why she's refusing to install it, and that's how the GF learns what his setup actually does. Did the friend say he was some sort of creep, or did she say something to the effect of \"there's no way I'm installing, it's effectively spyware\"? Because that'd be an accurate thing to say. That's not saying he's a \"secret creep\". And it doesn't take having some sort of trauma from some creep to get freaked out over realizing what her BF did without informing her.  \n\nBlaming the friend for OP's lack of communication is not reasonable. It's not a communication problem on her end, either, but on his. I get all he probably did is not communicate clearly and not react well when she got upset about it. But he massively violated her trust by doing so.", "Everything you say makes sense but I\u2019m just not following how this equates to a \u201cmassive violation of trust\u201d based purely on the information given. But maybe I\u2019m putting too much on OP\u2019s stated intent (or lack thereof) and not giving enough credence to the initial conversations leading up to the gf downloading the certs.\n\nI do see where you\u2019re coming from though, and agree that this seems to be an issue of incomplete or poor communication, which should be solved by OP (and also the dude should just set up a guest network and bypass this)."]}
