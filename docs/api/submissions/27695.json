Ppl often misuse boundaries as a means to control others. \nAs for the bride, she clearly thought she could rely on her friends/bridesmaids to be a safe space where she can let her hair down and have some fun. She obviously has deeper issues in her relationship if she needs to lie to her fiance in order to do that and if she\u2019s so scared to confess even after the fact to the extent that she lets her friends take the fall. \nWhere i come from, friends do cover for eachother in difficult situations if there are no serious consequences per se. Eitherway it is not your place to tell the fianc\u00e9 anything, it is entirely between them what level of honesty they maintain in their relationship.

Seriously, what if roles were reversed, and she was the one who didn't want the stripper at his bachelor party but he did it anyway (after promising not to have one) but told her it wasn't him, it was the groomsmen! Would that be acceptable? No, because then she would never trust any of the groomsmen again and eventually would insist on the friendships ending.\n\nTell him the truth.

One doesn't automatically have rights over the other.\n\nThe lack of communication and compromise isn't promising.", "His boundary was \"if you have strippers, it will impact me negatively and make me unhappy.\" That's what 'no strippers' means. It's not controlling her to let her know that something would be a big  issue to him. He is allowed to have feelings, especially over something as unessential as a stripper. She could either accept it, support him as his fiancee, or break his trust and do something that would hurt him.\n\nShe did it anyway knowing it would hurt him and break his trust (she must have agreed to what he said initially, then changed her mind, which makes her a liar also). The reason he wants an apology from the friends is because his fiancee lied to him and said THEY are the reason his CLEAR boundary was completely crossed, and they are the reason he's now upset/stressed  etc \n\nPeople need to learn there are consequences for breaking the trust of others and doing things they said would hurt them. If calling off the marriage is the consequence he chooses, that isn't being controlling, it's called having self respect and not trapping yourself in a marriage with someone who is untrustworthy and a liar. He deserves to know what she did AND that she chose to lie about it rather than having a conversation and explaining her choices.\nESH.", "ah yes the element of dictatorship on having hard boundaries based on a normalized monogamous view of sex and matters of a sexual nature. You talk as if she's asking for something absolutely essential, when it's literally a fucking stripper that she wanted, very one-dimensional in terms of what they offer. Live off of the internet for a while lmao.\n\nSome stuff is just not \"up for discussion\" in relationships. If my girlfriend said something with finality, that's her boundary to have, and mine to decide on whether I respect it or not. There's no reason for me to lie to her, and doing so would make me an asshole regardless of any justifications I might have. Somehow I doubt you'd be jumping to advocate for me in that case anyway. There is no compromise and communication to be had here once it has been established to be important... Dumbass.", "Also, hiring *sex workers* is an entirely different boundary to set in a monogamous relationship than something like telling your partner they aren't allow to go out with their friends. One of these is controlling behavior, one of them is a totally normal term of monogamy."]}
