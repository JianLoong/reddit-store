A week after her bachelorette party one of the bridesmaids ex boyfriend logged into her messenger and took one of the videos we had sent of that night and sent it to the brides fiance. It was a video of her literally throwing dollar bills on the stripper. The fiance was extremely upset and the bride decided instead of coming clean she was just going to blame the whole thing on us the bridesmaids. She told fiance that she told us not to get her a stripper and that we still did anyways. She also said she only got one dance and then went into her room until he was gone which is also not true. Now fast forward to one week before the wedding the bride texts us to say that her fiance is very upset at us and does not want us to be in the wedding anymore. She then also says that we need to apologize to him. Yes, apologize to her fiance for HER lies. I did it. We all did. We sent the apologies and everything is pretty much fine now but I\u2019m very upset at my friend for asking us to do that in the first place. I was fine to take the fall for her until she wanted us to apologize to him.

You\u2019re not an asshole for not wanting to be in her wedding, but I think that lying for her and apologising to him was not the right thing to do. \n\nIt was a boundary he had in their marriage and she broke it, and he at least deserves the truth about what happened", "ESH\n\nThis marriage is doomed.", "ESH. What a horrible situation. The least you could've done was tell the groom the truth and save him from this terrible marriage. Also, stop being friends with this person. They are awful. Get better friends.", "ESH\n\nThe bride showed zero respect for her fianc\u00e9 in insisting on a stripper. She showed zero respect for her bridesmaids in blaming all of you, then demanding that you apologize. You showed zero respect for her fianc\u00e9 in lying for her.", "ESH. Why did you lie to the finance by apologizing?", "ESH.  It's understandable why you no longer want to be in the wedding, but you also made the bed you're lying in because you went along with it.  Seems you were fine with the lie until it made YOU feel bad.  Continuing to be a bridesmaid is in step with how you've handled this so far.\n\nIf you continue this friendship, you need to be comfortable lying to her soon to be spouse.  Is this friendship worth your self respect, I guess is the question you need to ask yourself.", "ESH except the future groom", "NTA, real friends don't ask you to lie for their mess-ups, much less make you apologize for their lies.", "NTA but someone needs to tell him and let him make his own decisions. I get wanting to be a good friend but it doesn\u2019t sound like she was being that to you and it isn\u2019t fair to him or you guys to take the fall for her when this could impact a life altering decision for him. He might be fine with it and move on,or it could be a dealbreaker.but if she treats her friends like that and is willing to get others to lie for her for this,it might only be a precursor to how she\u2019ll disregard his boundaries and trust . And I for one would be absolutely furious if i found out no one told me all went along with it", "NTA. but youd have not lied for her. id send him the panic at the disco song and exit stage left", "ESH - This is a perfect example why no one likes you when you\u2019re 23.", "NTA I wouldn't waste any time or money for this wedding from the sounds of it the reception will last longer then the marriage with all the lies.", "YTA for lying and taking the blame. She is not your friend", "ESH. No wonder y\u2019all are friends. You lot are willing to cover up for her bad behavior.

She never should\u2019ve asked in the first place. I wouldn\u2019t want to be in her wedding and I\u2019d tell her why. I\u2019d also not want to be her friend.", "NTA. She hated having a stripper there so much she was throwing dollar bills at him? Her fianc\u00e9 is an idiot if he believes her story just for that. Surely he could see her face on the video. But she had no right to ask you to lie for her and apologize or to throw the blame on you and the other bridesmaids. I can see this becoming a problem in the marriage later on if she cheats in anyway and asks you to cover for her. I would back out of the wedding and out of being her friend. She obviously values herself more than she values you or her fianc\u00e9.", "Someone who throws you under the bus like that isn't your friend.  I'd skip the wedding myself.  NTAH.", "ESH. You should have told the fiance the minute your friend said she wanted a stripper. Heck, you could have told him the truth when she told you to apologize to him. Instead you backed that lie by going along with your friends' plan for you and the other bridesmaids to take the blame.", "You should get a better friend.  She starting her marriage on a lie.", "NTA But grow a backbone", "NTA - But I feel a mixture of anger at your friend for asking you to apologize and pity for her because her fianc\u00e9 sounds really controlling.", "I have very mixed feelings. Of course, everything she did was wrong and everything you did was right.\n\nBut you'd still be the asshole if you let her down in my opinion. Your friend was very dishonest with her fianc\u00e9 and made you take the consequences of her actions. But that's what friends do, a briefe apology to keep things straight and avoid disaster. You didn't cover for your friend on a cheat or anything serious. It's not that big of a deal.\n\nYWBTA if you ditch her for her wedding. I know it's a controversial opinion and I wouldn't have appreciated being put in that position as a friend, but it would be quickly forgotten.", "YTA.. youre supposed to have your friends back...", "This is so funny because if it was a guy lying for his guy friend it would be applauded. That being said you did what a good friend should do.", "People should not get married until they are mature enough to be honest with their partners. She could have had a conversation about having strippers with him prior to the bachelorette and pushed back on his boundary for her in a respectful and assertive conversation, they could have come to a compromise if it was really important for her. But lying is BS. And if you want back on a promise, be honest about it.\n\nAlso, why is your friend's bf going through her phone and sending things? Did he have her permission? That's kinda gross.\n\nI think you're NTA because you got put on a rough spot, but your friends probably shouldn't be getting married.", "And went you shouldn't get married before your prefrontal cortex is developed.", "I\u2019m actually sat listening to that exact Blink 182 song!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nJust remind me - what\u2019s your age again? \ud83d\ude09\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
