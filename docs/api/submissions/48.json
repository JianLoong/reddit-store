I guess thinking about it in those terms double-double does make sense, it's just an unusual way of looking at it.", "NTA. That question has nothing to do with overthinking or autism, completely normal question and I think a lot of people would go through the same thought of process since double-double would make it sound like 2x2 which would be = 4.", "I have never been to in-n-out and I assumed a double-double was two double cheeseburgers. This whole thing has taken me a second to wrap my brain around. OP is NTA and it was weird that she said your confusion was because you are autistic.

NTA", "I literally thought it meant 4 patties when i first went to In-N-Out. My husband had to explain the 2 patties x 2 slices of cheese lmfao you weren\u2019t overthinking.  NTA", "Oh wow. This sounds like my day to day.   \n\n\nExample: Partner and I are moving a part of the sectional sofa upstairs for temporary storage (we're finally getting our new floors in the living room next week!!). This is our conversation, which devolved into a full-blown argument.   \n\n\nPartner: Okay, so let's turn it so this part \\*gestures vaguely to the top of the section\\* is facing upwards.   \n\n\nMe: What do you mean, turn it so the top is facing upwards? It's already pointing up! (at this point, sectional was on the ground with the back pointing up, as if I were to sit on it normally).   \n\n\nPartner: no, so this part \\*waves hand\\* is facing up.   \n\n\nMe: \\*fully placing hands on the top of the sofa section\\* For clarification, you want this part \\*slaps uppermost part of the back of the couch\\* facing upwards? Why do we then need to turn it, as it's facing upwards already?  \n\n\nWe go back and forth a few times, with partner saying the same thing and me asking for clarification using any and all means available. I repeatedly touched the top of the back of the sofa, asking if partner wanted this part \\*specifically touching the top of the back of the sofa\\* pointing upwards. After about 3 times of me asking and pointing out what I'm talking about, partner gets frustrated that I'm not understanding and physically turns the sectional piece how they want it oriented. Aha - partner wanted the back of the sofa facing upwards, not the top of the back of the sofa. Makes more sense now. We then went on to argue about \"That's what I said!!!\" and me pointing out well, no, you didn't say that, you said this. Partner gets mad after I explained there's a difference between the back of the sofa (meaning the literal backside of the sofa) and the top of the back of the sofa (meaning the part of the back that sticks up and cushions go against).   \n\n\nTo my partner, they're all the same piece. To me, they're different.   \n\n\nWe discussed that for a bit, and then partner hit me with their tired old, \"Well, English isn't my first language and I couldn't find the right words.\" Note: my partner began learning English at 10 years old, outside of the normal schooling of English. They work at a multi-national company where English is the main language, we spoke only English at home until our kid was born, and sometimes their grammar is better than mine.   \n\n\nThis is an argument they've trotted out before, to which I always respond that they should speak their native language (which I am 90% fluent in after 10 years of living here) and I would ask questions if I needed clarification. Mind you, this is our agreement - that partner would speak Dutch (native language) whilst I spoke English (my native tongue) so our kid would grow up bilingual and without shitty grammar in either language. Partner never follows the agreement, which they asked for in the first place.   \n\n\nWow, this is turning out to be longer than expected for me to say I get where you're coming from and struggle to make my partner understand my POV. I haven't been tested, but I'm pretty damn sure I'm on the spectrum based on family history and my \"peculiarities,\" as my mom called them.", "NTA but let things go.\n\nAlso, you can order a triple triple even if it's not on the menu.

Although it tastes better than McDonald's, McD's never caused me food poisoning... twice.", "NAH\n\nIt can just get frustrating for the other person to feel \"grilled\" when they don't know the answer.\n\nThe biggest problem you missed is that she was EXCITED for you to try In-N-Out Burger, for the two of you to share an experience she hoped you would enjoy (trying the burger).\n\nFor the question to occur to you is fine, but unfortunately, you inadvertently changed the subject, from you two sharing a fun experience, to the semantics of a chain restaurant menu, which deflated her enthusiasm and made her feel bad, because you didn't acknowledge or show enthusiasm for her effort to do something fun together.", "[deleted]", "Gonna get downvoted for it, but I'm going YTA.
