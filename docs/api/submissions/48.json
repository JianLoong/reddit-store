We just paid for rehab for him, which was very expensive. We told him this was his last chance. Every time before we have ended up being exploited and enabling him, so we have given him a set of conditions he must follow to stay with us. He has lived with us for two weeks and we are clashing. He claims he has no independence, but when we gave him that he just used more and we enabled him.\n\nHere are the conditions.\n\n1. No drugs or alcohol \n\n2. No friends or girls over \n\n3. No junk food in the house\n\n4. Wifi time restricted to 3 hours per day. \n\n5. If he wants to buy something he has to ask us for the money and prove he spent it on what he said\n\n6. Must apply for jobs every day\n\n4. Daily room check for drugs, alcohol, razors etc.(he cuts himself and has been hospitalised several times)\n\n5. Must attend all probation and therapy appointments \n\n6. 9pm curfew\n\nIf he breaks any of these we will kick him out -immediately for drugs and alcohol and probation, and a few strikes for the others. \n\nHe claims the food restriction is unnecessary but he has had food addiction before and we don't want him to gain weight and become unhealthy. Currently he is very skinny and sticking to a healthy diet but he became obese after quitting drugs last time, this worsened his mental health issues. We are a very health conscious family.\n\nHe doesn't like the wifi restriction, but we want him to use his time productively and not just gaming or watching videos.\n\nHe seems to think we don't love him or trust him. It's true we don't trust him, but we do love him.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want him to be independent and not live with us and if he sticks to the rules we will relax them, and if not he can move out.

It's not just \"no people over\" in general? Who *is* allowed? Male enemies?", "I think it is too strict. Can you ask his counselor or addiction specialist about it? That\u2019s a lot of time on his hands with nothing to do.", "These are the kind of rules you set when you are pushing someone to leave.  Is that what you really want?\n\nHe is an addict, but he is not a child.  Restricting his internet, forbidding friends as a blanket rule, micromanaging his food....it feels like he's being set up to fail because anyone would chafe at those rules, and when he rebels, then it's his fault.  Like if you don't want him there, just say so.", "YTA.  You sound more like a prison guard than a parent. While I agree you need strict rules, you are taking things too far. Three hours is hardly time to job search and no junk food and reporting spending is just beyond crazy. If these are the kind of rules he grew up with its no wonder he turned to drugs.", "No fast food? Makes no sense\n\nAnd do you think kicking him out will help him? \n\nAnd what's up with three hours of wifi? How much of that will go to applying to jobs?", "Total get why you are doing this and he is very lucky to have you care so much but what are his goals?\n\nWhile the rules are to protect him and yourself how long will this be going on.  When will his independence kick in and what skills will he have to move forward without drugs?\n\nI don\u2019t know your family or your son but my experience in work with people in recovery is learning to deal with situations that the drug\u2019s masked.  There will be a time no matter how much he is loved he will need to be independent. \n\nHaving the skills to deal with those situations in a healthy manner is what will keep him as healthy as possible. \n\nI wish you and your family all the best in a trying time.", "NTA because it\u2019s your house, but that set of rules is dehumanizing. I don\u2019t get the wifi thing??? If he\u2019s applying for jobs everyday isn\u2019t it ok to have some downtime too? Getting a chance to relax and depressurize will be better for healing than constantly forcing him into your definition of productive. Maybe help him work on self esteem\u2026I\u2019m betting that\u2019s taken a massive hit. Why a curfew? It\u2019s ok to say, we absolutely don\u2019t trust you. You showed we couldn\u2019t. But we really want to again", "Yta- some of these are reasonable, some are going to be counter productive. Remember he is an adult and has to be able to have some control over his life. Feeling like you have lack of control is actually one of many reasons people turn to drugs/ alcohol. Also, if he is miserable, then it\u2019s likely he will think \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of being sober\u201d. \n\n1, 6, 7 and 8 are reasonable requests due to his history, the others are not, and could cause more problems in the future. 2 probably needs some negotiation. He can\u2019t live in isolation/ never having any friends or support system, but obviously some friends will be problematic due to his history. He can\u2019t live his life isolated though!\n\nIt sort of seems like you are setting him up to fail so that you can kick him out and blame him.", "YTA but only for like 50% of these. My mother is/was a hardcore opiate addict for years, and even after she got out of jail she didn\u2019t have rules these strict.\n\n3 Hours of Wifi? That\u2019s all? Everything is done online now. \n\nNo friends? I get if they are his shitty enabler friends, but the man cannot live in a vacuum. He cannot just be left to his own devices and you expect that he turn out adjusted. He needs to feel some semblance of control over his life.\n\nNo fast food? This dude served his time. Don\u2019t take him from one jail and put him in another. I am honestly surprised you haven\u2019t asked him to pay fucking rent.", "How is he suppose to be distracted from wanting to do those things when you take away things to distract him?", "YTA. It is just too much. 3 hrs wi-fi is ridiculous, especially if you want him to apply for jobs. He has to be able to learn to manage his life. By no means am I saying trust him, but he can't stare at the walls all day either. Watching movies, getting news, reading books all happens on-line. Your food controls are too much as well. An addict can't give everything up at once. He needs to learn how to moderate the things in his life.\n\nWhy don't you give him productive tasks that he has interest in instead. For example, does he want to learn how to cook? He can watch some videos and make dinner.", "I am sorry you are going through this.  It must be terrible.  Honestly, my original position was to call you the AH.  Those rules sound terribly restrictive.  Somewhat understandable, but very restrictive.  My original thought was that some of these have nothing to do with his addiction, but I don't really know that.\n\nSo I am going to say NTA.  But I do have to wonder if your approach will get you to what you want.  I don't know that anything will.  It seems like you may be setting up a situation where nobody can win.  If he is already complaining about the rules and thinks they are unfair, then the likelihood of him following them are probably very low.  And if you cut the list down by removing the ones he complains about the most, would he just start complaining about the others?   So is this just avoiding the inevitable?  Prolonging the agony?  To be blunt - do you have any doubt in your mind that he won't break the rules and you won't have to end up kicking him out?\n\nI know as parents you have to try everything to try and save your son.  Even if you think your attempt is doomed to fail.  And I know that unless your son is ready to heal himself, no amount of rules will protect him.  I feel terrible that the addiction tragedy the world faces is so bad and there is so little effective help that parents look to Reddit for advice.  You have my deepest sympathy.", "Lose the junk food, wifi, and *maybe* extend the curfew, and he wouldn\u2019t complain I bet. The point of recovery is to *enjoy* not being addicted. You\u2019re just going to push him to relapse or be out on the street.\n\nLetting him eat junk food (seriously? It\u2019s still your house, if he gets excessive you can just stop him) and have unlimited access to the internet (in this day and age that shouldn\u2019t even be a question) pose absolutely 0 threat to you or him.\n\nYou invited him back, I assume you love him even though you have been burned by him. Just try it out. Excessive snacks and youtube won\u2019t end his progress. YTA", "NTA but exclude time spent searching for jobs or doing anything educational from his wifi time. Those are things to encourage imo. So if he spent 3 hours legit job searching and taking a class online then he still gets 3 hours to play.", "Maybe use internet time as a reward for completing other parts of the list successfully, and/or for improvement. For instance, if he helps with house or yard work on his own.", "NTA but the wifi rule is a bit harsh. A lot of job application stuff is done online now and it\u2019s difficult to heal without some break time. Unless he\u2019s been caught doing bad stuff online, just turning it off at night would be more reasonable.", "YTA. I get that it's tough recovering from dealing with an addict, but you are going to drive him away. \n\nYou should be working with professionals to set reasonable guidelines. Yours do not foster independence", "NTA. I know it seems overly strict to some people, but I also know that you sometimes reach a point with addicts and their never-ending patterns of manipulation and bullshit that you have to draw bright lines. Until people have been there, it's tough to judge.\n\nThat being said, this isn't going to work out and I suspect everyone knows it.\n\n>He seems to think we don't love him or trust him. It's true we don't trust him.\n\nAnd this is fair, honestly. Nobody is entitled to trust, much less those who repeatedly break it.", "NTA. Is he getting therapy for addiction and whatever else is leading to his unhealthy choices? And maybe have a way for him to earn some of this stuff? Like if he follows all rules for x weeks or months, he can control what he eats and if he lands a job, he can control his wifi usage? And once he's had a job for 3 months, have him start paying rent.", "YTA\n\nDo you want a son or a ficus? Because outside the 3 hours he's gonna be looking for jobs, the rest of his life's gonna be that. I don't get why he would try to evade from it.", "NAH. A lot of the people posting here have clearly never lived with an addict. Addicts have a way of eroding boundaries and before you know it you are paying for them to get a taxi to a dealer just so you know they are safe. \n\nThese are without a doubt very strict rules, and you should probably have a plan of how/ when to loosen them eg if he has a job then internet time is likely out of your control as he would be able to get it on a phone.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t have to help him to this point despite being his parents and I know it\u2019s hard for him considering his situation but at some point he has to learn independence and his mother and father won\u2019t always be there to save him. I don\u2019t know his friends but I think rule 2 is a bit restricting unless his friends are bad influences, the key to getting back out there is connections and socialisation so I think it would be nice to maybe let him have some friends over.", "Well, you guys are the ones who know your son the best and what he will do with too much freedom. I would trust your instincts on what to do, you know him better than any of us redditors do. However, the Wi-fi thing seems a bit far. Having some distractions could be good for him. Overall tho, seems fair. But again, y\u2019all know your son the best, and I think you should trust your gut. NTA", "NTA- this may seem like an overprotective parent at first glance, your son had a serious drug issue.\n\nThis isn\u2019t something you can be lax about. While he may hate this, it truly is for his own good. \n\nHe needs serious structure and accountability, as you\u2019ve said in the past you\u2019ve tried to help, perhaps more hands off, and he\u2019s backslid.\n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s your house, your rules. He has proven he can\u2019t be trusted when left to his own devices. This is a BIG hill for him to climb, and I truly hope that when he gets to a good place in his life, he will thank you for this love.", "YTA. Let him have wifi / phone. Literally all taking that away does is isolate him and lead to depression and significantly limit his time finding a job. Community is super important getting sober, so let him have his phone / wifi. \n\nThe food stuff sounds controlling too. Let the dude eat what he wants. If he starts to gain weight he can discuss it with a therapist.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to require him to have a job, go to therapy, no drugs & alcohol and check on that daily, and to use money as intended.\n\nThe rest is overkill and he will end up rebelling against it as most people would with that level of strictness.\n\nHave you thought about therapy for yourself? Not being presumptuous and saying with compassion. Maybe you have, but it isn\u2019t easy to have a family member who is an addict and can be painful, so I hope you are being kind to yourself and giving yourself support as well.", "NTA\n\nIf you didn't love him you wouldn't be giving him a place to live.   Trust, well, trust is earned and he's got a long way to go before he earns any of that again.", "Info:\n\nSo he can\u2019t have anyone over? Does the wifi time include the time he looks for a job? The fast food rule seems a bit counter productive. Why not try to show him control of some of his worse habits so he can try to control himself on it for when he becomes independent?\n\nSeems like a lot of his day might not include much for a while, it\u2019s maybe not the best for recovery. NAH.", "I think rules 1,5, 6,7 and maybe 9 are okay. \nThe rest are unnecessary, controlling, and don\u2019t help his recovery.\n\nFriends and food should not be restricted and Wi-Fi use doesn\u2019t really make sense either", "Yta. Most of these ruls are beneficial. Offer any therapy sessions and job interviews are done online. Also restricting food could just lead to a whole slew of other problems. Funny things can only be done online. And not necessarily within a 3-hour window. You're a mega asshole for that.", "Nta, literally a homeless shelter would be worse if not the same if he wanted to stay there. He's not there by choice, he's there by consequence. This is to keep away all distractions, and get the move on with his life.", "NTA if he just got out of prison he should not have any relationships for one year, has to focus on himself.", "NTA. I think the food is a bit extreme, but the rest of it is reasonable.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s called tough love\u2026but it is love.", "NTA trust is something earned.

Some of those rules are reasonable. Some are likely counterproductive.", "I can almost see where you are coming from... but this level of restriction will absolutely push him away. Why no friends?

The rules about those things are at least helpful. His recovery does not depend on his body shape or size.

You're going for a normal brain right now because the drugs have messed with it.

You're making it worse by stressing him out. A lot of these I see good intentions and boundaries he does need. Especially if he's living under a roof you're paying for.
