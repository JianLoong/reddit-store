{"id": 69, "submission_id": "yiye9e", "title": "AITA for considering ending immigration sponsorship for family?", "selftext": "Let's get straight to it. I was raised by my mother (U.S. citizen) who passed away in my early 20's from cancer. My father is an immigrant, who was deported from the United States after my parents divorced when I was about 7 yrs old.\n\nWhen I was about 25 yrs old after years of saving and sending money abroad, paying legal fees I finally got my father to the United States. I did this while being a single parent. I did feel a moral and somewhat cultural obligation to help my father, and most importantly prior to my mother's death she stressed that he is the only living parent I had and encouraged my emigrating him to the U.S. again to work on our relationship. \n\nMy father has limited education but does hold several trade certs including carpentry, trucking, & welding -he gained these certs in the U.S. He arrived in the U.S. when he was in his early 50's after being outside the U.S. for over 25 years, for context he has about an 85-90% grasp of English as opposed to a person born & raised stateside. Upon arrival to the U.S. we immediately agreed to start the process for my underage siblings & his spouse abroad. \n\nLet's get to the nitty gritty. It's been 7 years, & he can't hold a job longer than a yr but typically not averaging over 5 months. He goes through months of unemployment. When he does work he squanders his money, I can count less than 10 times he's paid towards rent, groceries or utilities while staying with me let alone contributed to the legal fees for HIS families immigration. He is a gross person in terms of his world views, insufferable. I won't pretend like there haven't been \"good\" times but the  bad greatly overshadows. To date I've spent well over 20k in this process, he's ungrateful and belligerent, selfish. I'm tired. \n\nI've depleted my 401k from over 40k down to about 15k since his living with me. Examples of his behavior include begging and coercing me into cosigning on a loan then refusing to pay, living in my house driving my car but calling me lazy or dramatic when I bring up the fact that I'm stressed. \n\nThough not necessarily my business, he doesn't hide the fact that he's cheating on his spouse who is abroad with their children (my siblings) either. \n\nI'm so frustrated w/ him, our communication is down to a trickle. I need to know AITA For considering withdrawing my immigration sponsorship for his spouse & my siblings abroad? At face value my siblings are children & have been nothing but kind. They can't be held responsible for what my father's done, nor could they TRULY understand at the ages they are. That said, I've made several complaints to his wife who almost always finds a way to defend his behavior which makes me wonder- are they in on this together? Also, as a man he cannot demonstrate or has not- that he's stable enough to support HIMSELF, AND his wife & kids when they arrive to the U.S. I have children of my own and DON'T want that responsibility.", "created_utc": 1667275886, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiye9e/aita_for_considering_ending_immigration/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is exactly your father entitled to? Just because your mom made you promise you would bring him to the US and work on your relationship, doesn't mean you have to solve his life. You did your part, however, he doesn't seem to be very willing to do nothing on his side. Let's face it: there is no relationship to work on there. Period. Your father isn't able to support himself, wll he be able to support his family, or will he happily dump that responsibility on you while he continues to live the life of the philandering husband and irresponsible father? I think you already know the answer.", "NTA. Withdraw and make sure you and your kids are financially protected.", "NTA.\n\nJesus. He sounds awful. I would withdraw as soon as possible to avoid getting sucked in further. He will continue to drain you financially.", "You kept your promise to your mother. You made the effort to help your father and get to know him. What you know is that he is a very dishonest, advantageous, untrustworthy individual.

Like the flight attendants say, put on your oxygen mask before helping your neighbor.  It\u2019s a sorry situation, but it sounds like your dad will pull you down financially and emotionally.  You have invested a lots of time, energy, and money in your dad.  Maybe in a few years you will be in a better position to help you siblings, but not at the expense of your immediate family.  But right now it seems like you need to regain your equilibrium.", "Stop enabling this !! This really burns me up !!! I went thru the same exact thing !!\nCost me a lot of money.

This seems like a very difficult and precarious situation to be forced into and im sorry its where u find yourself. My grandfather also left his home county ahead of the rest of the family to save money to bring them out too. EVERY SINGLE CENT he had, he saved for his family to be able to leave, because thats what he WANTED. He did anything and everything he could to take care of his family. All of that to say what your father wants is achievable, he just doesn't seem to want to actually do it. Honestly very much sounds like he's bleeding you dry.\n\nYour apprehension is understandable, but it seems like at this point your choices are either remove yourself from your father and his family or be dragged down with him. Think about your child and do whats best for them, he and his family will survive but how that happens isnt your responsibility. You deserve respect and security, and you get to decide how to get that regardless of what that means for your dad\n\nYou matter, dont let your father supercede that fact.", "NTA. This sounds like a really toxic environment, and I am going to guess you would up supporting the rest of the family if  they make it to the US.
