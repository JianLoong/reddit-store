If she wants to continue to be around then she needs to start learning to get along with you.\n\nYou did what was best for your daughter and for co-parenting as time goes on. I really hope his gf figures out how to understand that and starts being nicer instead of instigating drama.

But you never know. \n\nIf I had to guess (which I do since OP isn\u2019t answering questions), I would bet that OP and the guy broke up long ago.
