Recently she has been dating a guy called Miles and he's a widowered father of 3 young kids. My cousin has been unsettled about things in the relationship but she really could see a future with Miles. However, becoming a stepmom is something she was unsure of. She has some sadness surrounding her own upbringing in a blended family. I was also part of one as a kid but had a different circumstance with it.\n\nSo my cousin was talking about it around her mom, stepdad, brother and me recently. She said she's terrified of doing the wrong thing. Her mom told her she'll be great and creating a blended family is such a blessing and she should never be deterred from a relationship just because the partner has kids. Her stepdad agreed and said it was kind of silly to be so worried about it.\n\nShe asked me what I thought and whether I thought she would make a good stepmom. I hesitated and she told me she wanted the truth. And I told her I honestly did not think she would be suited to it. My cousin is sweet but very sensitive. Her stepsiblings were never very fond of her and as an adult and someone approaching 30 it still bothers her and she still carries that rejection around with her. She has confided in me that she wishes more than anything they had wanted to build a relationship with her as siblings. Even past friendships that just faded with time she carries around a sadness with them. She has a strong desire to be loved and struggles if love isn't reciprocal with the same intensity? I know blending families can be different from family to family. Some stepkids will never love their stepparents, while some will, some will remain distant and others will have a very non-parental but good relationship.\n\nI don't think my cousin could be happy loving kids as her own, which she would, and not having the love returned. I don't think she would pressure them but I think it would weigh her down until she changed as a person and could possibly end up holding onto so much more. Given her very much still lingering hurt about the lack of closeness with her stepsiblings, I fear it would be harder for her in the shoes of a stepparent. Especially when she has been in ongoing therapy to help her navigate all of this.\n\nI explained all this to my cousin and she understood my perspective. But her mom and stepdad were furious at me and they said my cousin would make an amazing stepmom and I shouldn't be discouraging her or saying she won't be bad when she hasn't even really tried. They told me I should keep my mouth closed in the future even if I'm asked, because it's cruel to be so hard on someone. My cousin said I was right to be honest, she asked, but I think she was a little sad.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702474716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hgz87/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_i_dont_think_she/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your cousin even sounds like she was genuinely thinking about what you said, rather than blowing you off completely.\n\nBecoming a step-parent is not something to jump into unless you're absolutely sure you can handle it. She's right to stop and question whether she's suited for it; I've seen posts on here about people who have become step-parents knowing that the children are involved in their SO's life, and loathe and resent them for that.\n\nIt's not just about what's best for her, but also what's best for the kids, especially if they're very young, and are completely reliant on him (and will become reliant on her, if things turn serious between her and their father).", "NTA. It was not cruel to tell your cousin what you thought, since that is what she asked and she wanted the truth. I have experience as a stepmum and I can say for sure that you should not expect anything from your SOs children at all. Even the title as stepmum should not be given out automatically. It should be earned. But you should not expect a thing from the kids, because \n\n- they did not ask for you to come into their lives\n- they do not owe you their love or even their affection\n- they do not even owe you obedience\n- you are not their parent\n\nIf things go well, you may eventually become a stepmum. That is an adult that they trust and possibly even like sometimes.\n\nIf your cousin can go into the relationship under those circumstances and still love those kids, then she should definitely try. If not, well ... Some single parents really shouldn't remarry till their children are grown. It very much depends on the circumstances.", "NTA. It's not that your cousin would be a bad stepmother, but that she is not prepared to be a stepmother at this moment. Being aware that she is not ready for that responsibility and considering her decision is the right thing to do.", "I'd like to point out that you never said (at least, in your post) that she would be BAD at it. You thought she would love the kids like her own, but it would take an emotional toll on her if she were rejected by the kids. That is NOT a reflection on her ability to do the job, but merely pointing out the cost of it. She could be an excellent step-parent, but if the cost is going to be her mental and emotional well-being, there are valid reasons to be concerned and rethink the idea. It doesn't sound like she has much involvement with the kids, so the only alternative is \"give it a try and see what happens\", but if things go down hill later, it will be even harder for her to pull back from it, in which case, she may very well be T A in that case (for example, if one kid loved her, but the other didn't - or for leading the father on that it could work when she had doubts). Not saying that would happen, only that it could if left to chance or the \"wait and see\" mentality).  \n\n  \nYou raised mature, clearly thought out issues and left her to make her own decision. Her parents are looking at this in terms of how they WANT it to turn out. Life is rarely that smooth. NTA for looking out for your cousins mental and emotional well-being.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nShe *asked*. She wanted your honest opinion, and you gave it to her (and it sounds like in a really healthy way based on what you know about her own struggles in the past). As a friend and cousin, it's great that you have that sort of open honesty between you.\n\nThe only AHs in this story are her mom/stepdad - they want you to either push what they want or to shut up if you disagree. It's pretty easy to see why your cousin had issues with her stepfamily given this reaction.", "YTA.\n\nYou did the right thing by letting her know your assessment and how you think she might struggle with being a step parent. It's good that you were honest and that you gave your sincere advice.\n\nHOWEVER,\n\nWhen you say someone isn't suited towards something, that inherently means you have to say something uncomfortable about them / you have to criticize them. There's a time and place to constructively criticize someone, and that time is not in a group setting. It would have been a lot better for you to have waited to share your honest assessment when you could get a private moment with your cousin, so that you didn't have to criticize her in front of her parents.\n\nI understand that your cousin asked you in a group setting, but you should be able to recognize that it's not the right place to share your thoughts and side step the question until it is a good time. Otherwise, you just open the door to offending her parents for no benefit to anyone, which is what happened this time.", "I do think YTA for focusing on her sensitivity and her past when what matters most is, what are her expectations for this blended family? What role does she expect to take on? How would she react if the kids don\u2019t align with those expectations? \n\nYou kind of made her at fault for her own past which is a bit unfair.

There was no insult or ill intentions in what you said.", "INFO.    How old are the kids?  I think this is a huge issue. What is her relationship currently with the kids?", "If you and your cousin are as close as you say, you are one of the few people she should be able to ask and get an honest answer. Plus, it\u2019s not her that thinks you are out of line; it\u2019s her parents. You did the right thing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This reminds me of a quote I read in a book. \u201cPeople claim to crave the truth, but they seldom like the taste when it\u2019s served up.\u201d", "NTA, you were asked a question, told to be honest, and you did just that. \n\nI get the parent's perspectives wanting the best for their daughter and believing that she could do as a father of two children myself. But in conversations like these, you have to weigh the pros and cons of the choice that one could make. You did the right thing by telling her the truth, but you also need to mention she needs some therapy. I've personally had rejection issues that I have toughed out and got over on my own but not everyone can do that. Your cousin seems like its not just rejection but also comments in the negative (see your last few lines. she's just sad from you telling her the truth like she wanted something more positive) She needs to talk it out and get help getting better so she can handle negative responses and rejection better.", "NTA.  It sounds like you made some very logical points and made them kindly and thoughtfully.  Your cousin asked you oa question and you answered,  It's a different opinion, no need for your parents to react so extremely.", "NTA. You're not saying she wouldn't make a good stepmum, from what I read it actually seemed the opposite. More that maybe she also needs to consider herself and protect herself too. \n\nYou also told her the truth as you understand it. A decision so big that impacts so many shouldn't be built on fibs.", "NTA you were not cruel, just honestly explained the reasoning for your opinion, being asked for such. it sounds like you care for her a lot and you worry she might end up in a bad place mentally. it's also an extremely difficult situation for the kids and if they already expressed their disapproval this might be even harder on her. but, she might at least try to meet them. try suggesting not a stepmom, but a friend. perhaps it will be good to try and help setting her expectations on this and support her to become a \"friend if dad's\" for now.", "NTA. I wish more people would give this more thought. I am definitely someone who would not make a good step parent. I an not ashamed to admit it. Having kids that I could love and potentially lose a relationship with if the marriage ended, having another adult other than my partner making decisions about my kids and all the other stiff that comes with blended families does not suit my personality. Making the decision not to negatively impact a potential kid life is the moral decision.", "NTA. Your cousin is facing a HUGE life decision and it's very mature and wise of her to be considering it so carefully, weighing pros and cons, listening to multiple points of view etc. Her parents are fools for thinking that adopting a head in the clouds, 'la la la everything will be fine no matter what!' attitude about it is somehow better than thoughtful consideration. Some older people can really hold on to the idea that talking openly and honestly about issues is worse than ignoring them. You did right by your cousin.", "NTA.\n\nMy heart breaks for your cousin, it really does.  But there's no way she's not going to try to fill that hole with Stepkids.  They're going to grow up to be writing here - possibly when the time comes for a wedding - to ask if they're TA for just not seeing her as Mom, even if she's fantastic.\n\nShe needs to be involved with a partner who doesn't have pre-existing children.  The stakes are too high to take a chance.", "NTA at all.\r  \nIt seems to have insulted her parents more then herself. You were straight foward, yet extremely sensitive with the subject and respectful. You brought up good and valid points to the discussion.\n\n\r  \nYou seem to know your cousin very well and for her to ask this question, means she probably have the same worries you have.\n\n\r  \nYou verbalizing those might even help her realising how she can still go foward in this relationship keeping in mind the endless possibilities ahead of her with her step children. If she is conscious of her possible behaviors, that discussion would only have helped her figuring out how to deal with the love (or lack there of) of her stepchildren.\r  \n\r  \nI think your comments will be helpful no matter the decision she makes.", "Nta. Her parents are though. Someone asked for an hose mat opinion and you gave it. That simple. What her parents think is irrelevant and would cause me to tell them to fuck off. Don\u2019t ask a question you don\u2019t want the answer to.", "NTA she literally asked. \nBefore I got married I purposely never dated someone with children because I\u2019d just not have coped well with it. You have to be honest with yourself about these things before the children suffer.", "NTA", "NTA - they can't want an honest opinion and then be upset by the truth", "Question, has your cousin ever expressed wanting to have kids before? I assume she doesn't have any of her own otherwise this wouldn't be a problem. If she has never expressed interest that she wants kids and doesn't plan on having any, then it may not be smart to involve herself with someone that DOES, at least until she knows for sure what she wants. Not saying that it wouldn't work out, but it sure does make it harder.", "NTA...it seems like you gave her a thoughtful, honest, and caring opinion from a loving place. I am a step mom to 2 girls. While the oldest and I bump heads constantly the younger girl and I are closer then she is to either of her parents to the point where she told her Dad if he ever left me she's part of my family not his! LOL!", "NTA The reason they are upset is because your cogent well reasoned arguments prove that THEY failed to create the blended family they thought they had. That her step father FAILED as her step father. All their little delusions of how well they did, how their family was so happy were shown to be so much BS", "NTA it was not cruel, it was something your cousin needed to hear and think about. It was something you said because you love her and want the best for her.", "NTA your cousins parents are not motivated by supporting their daughter. They are motivated in proving that they were right. Because you pointed out their obvious failing in a blended family.", "NTA.  She asked for what you truly think, You gave her what you thought. She may be a bit sad, but thats the normal.\nYour Cousin, she understands why you think that  where it comes from.\n\nSure, you typically dont want to discourage people from things, but understanding how it affects is also important.", "I know people like that too. And it's awful for the kids. A friend of mine had that very experience when she was younger.\n\nI also know that people who struggle when love is not reciprocated can end up in a very bad mental space if they soldier on and keep things as they are because they feel like they're adults and they have to. And given how uncertain blending a family can be, it can be so dangerous to be that kind of person and enter one without really asking yourself if this is a good idea all around.", "Cousin's mom and stepdad see this as a referendum on their own choices. What they did was obviously beyond reproach (in their eyes) so everyone should want to do what they did and it will always be fantastic. And their shit don't stink and they tinkle champagne.\n\nAnd if you inject a note of reality into this, in their insecure eyes you are criticizing their life choices.\n\nThey're the absolute worst people to ask.\n\nTell cousin to read AITA and other forums that handle this issue.\n\nYour insight into her psychology sounds on the money, she sounds high risk for dealing with a blended family.", "Very well said! This is probably the best advice any prospective step parent can receive, and I'm definitely going to steal it in the future.\n\nOP's cousin might very well make a great stepmother one day (her own experiences can definitely help with what NOT to do), but she if she chooses to do so she really needs to make sure she's got the right expectations going in.", "Yes, this is very important to know for the context.", "OP did say that the cousin was almost 30, but didn\u2019t say about Miles and the kids.", "My cousin is 29. Not sure about Miles or his kids.", "I don't know the ages of the kids. She has yet to meet them. The question came up in part because Miles told her that the kids had not taken the news of him wanting to introduce them well and he wanted to postpone to get them some help. My cousin understood but she was feeling hurt about it even though she didn't blame the kids. It was just something else she carried and again another reason I feel the way I do.", "She's actually in therapy and has been for several years. It helped somewhat but she still takes a lot of stuff hard.", "The reality is, you never said she would be a bad stepmom. You said having love that was not reciprocated would be hard on her as a stepmom. after that is her choice if she wants to become one.", "It sounds like you gave her very kind and compassionate honesty. And I get her feeling sad about it, because sometimes truth is hard, but it sounds like she's thinking about it and considering what you've said. And you didn't at all say anything about her capability, just your concerns about her mental health and emotions, and left it up to her how she decides to navigate it. You're NTA, and it sounds like she appreciates your perspective, so no one else's opinion matters in this situation", "This already sounds like a not great situation. We don\u2019t know how long ago their mother died, and tbh, we don\u2019t know if your cousin\u2019s SO is looking for a wife or a stepmom for his kids( Hate to say this but it happens) \nWhile I am not so sure ALL men with children would be a bad thing, I am not sure some situations would be good for her mental health.\nWhat has her therapist said?", "Maybe some more intensive therapy then. I get rejection is hard but to carry that for years on is unhealthy. Does she have outlets to let her frustration and hurt out through?"]}
