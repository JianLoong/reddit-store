That he is not going to redo all of the work he already did? You ideally should, before going to the principal. Be nice, but firm. The notebook isn't at home, it was misplaced while at school, he will not be punished again for that. I would also ask if the punishment for a missing spelling notebook was ever made clear. Because making him miss recess (x2!) and trying to force him to redo the work sound entirely punitive and unlikely to have been spelled out ahead of time as consequences. \n\nRegardless of how that comes out, I would make a complaint to the principal about denying your son recess. I'm a former teacher. Denying a 6 year old recess (esp 2 days in a row) sets them up to fail in the classroom. Kids that young need to move as much as possible so they can be good students while in the classroom. Her denying him that ability is terrible teaching and poor management of student consequences.\n\nIf you're in the US, some states/school districts guarantee how much recess young students are to get, because it is so directly linked to their success in the classroom.\n\nThis teacher sounds like she's tired of dealing with kids and is just handing out punitive punishment whenever they make a child-like mistake (or their stuff gets stolen!). I applaud you not wanting to make her life more difficult, but I also saw plenty of this, and I encourage you to keep your eyes a little extra open as the year goes on.", "NTA. \n\nThe question of \"where is the book\" is a distraction. It doesn't matter where it is, your son doesn't have something he needs for his education. \n\nA first day punishment is one thing - you need to make snap-decisions to instill values and create an atmosphere of accountability, so, okay. Failing to follow up with you so that he's punished on day two is a failure of leadership on her part. \n\nAsking him to redo all the work is suspicious. Either he has been doing fine, and she knows he grasps the material, or he hasn't been doing fine, and some correction should already have been in the works, or she hasn't been evaluating the work, and that's not fair to your son. \n\nThe possibility of talking past each other seems high, perhaps she's \\[understandably but regrettably\\] projecting based on past experiences with aggressive and entitled parents. But the priority should be the education.", "Something smells fishy here to me. \n\nWhy wait 3 days to tell you instead of when it first went missing?  That is when she should of told you and when it could of been ruled out that son lost it at home, in car or school.  It could quite be possible another student took it and she doesn\u2019t want to ask other parents to look.  It easily could of fallen behind a bookshelf in classroom or in she spilled something on it while grading it.  If she damaged it and waited 3 days she can say he lost it and she punished him to hide it.  \n\nI would ask the principal if there is a lost and found just in case it fell out while son was walking to bus or car.  It wouldn\u2019t put the blame on anyone but it would show that you aren\u2019t an uninvolved parent either.", "NTA, there is nothing educative about her approach. \n\nI just would sidestep the whole issue of 'who did it' entirely. The facts are: it's lost, you don't know how or where, she did not inform you so you couldn't solve it, she punished him in a way that's already pretty unacceptable (taking away recess once is already pretty impactful, especially for something the child doesn't connect to that situation and is not a consequence for a warning, but multiple times without informing the parents is just not okay.) \n\nAnd then she doubles down on it. Raise it.", "NTA\n\nThe teacher is just being mean at this point. And she has already checked the work. This is sheer punitive, jerky behavior.\n\nPut all the facts on paper and email them to the principal. Say you're concerned about her policy and want to discuss it. This prevents a she said/you said situation, plus keeps you calm.\n\nYou want it on paper so if the principal supports the teacher, you can take it to the school board. This teacher is far off base. I'd support my child, too.\n\nedit: Stay calm and professional. Don't give the teacher or the principal any grounds for using anything against you.", "NTA He\u2019s not in college. Absolutely talk to the principal", "Why not just go right to having him drawn and quartered on the school grounds?   \n\n\nShe can\u2019t prove he lost it. She may have misplaced it, since she was the last person to be have care, custody and control of the notebook.   \nTherefore, she can needs to pay to replace the notebook, complete all the assignments to date and reimburse your son for lost recess time, as well as punitive damages for his emotional damages.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nEither she had previously checked/assessed his work from those twelve weeks, or she had failed to keep on top of things. If it is the former, he shouldn't have to re-do the work - re-do the classwork from the day or two before it went missing, fair enough if she'd not seen it yet, but not 12 weeks worth of work for a six year old. If it is the latter, it is not your son's fault she wasn't up to date with her part of the work.\n\nBut I wouldn't presume the teacher is at fault for a book going missing. They are six years old. Unless the teacher was responsible for taking the book out the bag, keeping an eye on it all day, and returning it to the bag to be send home, she can't be held responsible for it being missing. Kids misplace things. Adults do too, of course, but you can't blame the teacher for misplacing something just because it wasn't in your son's bag when you unpacked.\n\nIn hindsight, it clearly would have been worth you speaking with the teacher or sending a note in with him that first day you sent him in without it. After all, you knew he should bring it home each week. You knew it wasn't in his bag. A few short words to the teacher asking for him to be excused if work wasn't done on time because the book didn't come home with him might have prevented her from enacting that first punishment.\n\nBut when you approach the head, keep it polite and professional. You want to come to an agreement for a work around which doesn't unduly punish your son and doesn't impact his enjoyment in the work.", "Get the new book and clarify in an email (in writing)  he is to redo \"all the pages in the book prior to the current lesson\".....\n\nStrategically remove every page prior to the current lesson plan that night at home. \n\nStay petty, my friend", "NTA...The punishment seems excessive for a six year old.  Taking three days to notify you was also not acceptable. Your tax dollars pay that teacher, you have every right to complain if you think they're not effective.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nThere is a time to teach personal responsibility, but there is also a time to teach your child you will stand up for them\n\nThis is one of them imo\n\nMaking a 6 yo repeat 12 (twelve!?) Weeks of class work, and making you as their parent pay to repay them, for a notebook that you paid for to begin with, is absolutely absurd \n\nThe \"crime\" doesn't meet the punishment, and all this would teach your child is that teachers are horrible and not to be trusted, especially since he had already missed recess before even getting a chance to explain to you what had happened\n\nYou going above the teachers head would not be excessive in this case imo\n\nIt would be showing your child that sometimes, when you know your cause is worth sticking up for, it is worth doing so, even if your \"boss\" (his teacher) will be upset about it", "NTA\n\nTalk to the teacher (if you haven't yet) and explain that hey we have really looked all over for it. Who knows where it is but a 6 year old not being sure where their notebook is is not the end of the world and these repurcussions at that age are completely ridiculous. If this was a 10 year old it would still be stupidly excessive. If they don't listen then a talk with the principal would not be an AH move after a nice try to talk with the teacher.", "NTA - if she needs him to re-do 12 weeks of work, she's an irresponsible teacher who needs to start doing her grading more often.  Being 12 weeks behind on grading is ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nHe's 6 years old. This is ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re right, the punishment doesn\u2019t match the \u201ccrime\u201d, and you should talk to the principal about this. That being said, don\u2019t jump to conclusions that the teacher misplaced your son\u2019s notebook. She sounds like a dick, but I don\u2019t think she would go on that much of a power trip.", "NTA.  Asking a 6-year-old to re-do that much work is ridiculous.\n\nBut - you might be able to handle this without the principal.  Just advise the teacher that since the work was already done, your son will not be redoing it.  If she tries to punish him for that, then go to the principal.", "Wow. Just wow. NTA.\n\nI'd be having stern words with that teacher, that kind of punishment for a 6yo? What the hell is wrong with that teacher.", "NTA - your child needs to know you have his back.  I would suggest a meeting with the teacher and an administrator, this is nonsense. As someone who both had three children through public schools and worked for 12 years in the public school system, this teacher is flexing her control and nothing more.  Please be mindful of having someone else with you if you meet with her, even if it is her union rep (should it get to that) never let it be her against you type of scenario.  I would emphasize that he is six.  Hang in there.", "Teacher is on a power trip. NTA", "NTA NTA NTA.  This is absolutely OUTRAGEOUS.  I have a five year old and my head would be ROLLING if this were me.  You stand up for your son, OP!", "Even if it *was* his fault .. it\u2019s insane for a 6 year old to make up six weeks of work", "NTA! What is up with Reddit and teachers acting indifferent.\n\nThe book may have been lost by mistake but taking away recess and asking him to do 12 weeks worth of work is not a fair consequence.\n\nI think going to the principal seems like a wise solution.", "NTA.   \nThat teacher has a hard-on for punishment.   \nFrankly it's disgusting.", "NTA. This is a wildly inappropriate punishment for his age. There is a big movement to stop taking away recess as punishment as it often compounds bad behaviors. A 6 year old should have pretty minimal homework. Redoing 12 weeks of work is insane. This is definitely worth raising with the principal. Normally I would suggest speaking with the teacher first, but there are so many inappropriate behaviors here going over her head makes sense. She is clearly not properly trained/ supervised and is giving punishments inappropriate to the age group she is teaching.", "NTA. Taking away recess doesn't help anyone. Kids need them to have enough energy and concentration for the day, especially when they are still adjusting to school. There are so many possibilities where the book could be (there was a girl in my class that took away my stuff so that the teacher punished me in first grade) but punishing a 6yo like that is way over the top. \nDoes she even want to teach him, or does she just want to revenge the missing book?", "NTA- went through something similar. My son \"lost\" his school chrome book it was no whete to be found. I asked the teacher multiple times that maybe its in her room because it never made it home. (We still looked though)\n\nI told my son if it needs to be replaced its coming out of his account (he saves money) he was 7 at the time. He SWORE he had it at school and it just vanished.\n\nA month later I get a message from the teacher saying she accidently collected his chromebook and put it with her spares. The only way she found out was because he had been using the spares for class and finally one day she gave him his. He told her that chromebook was his and was able to log in w/ his passwords and the serial # matched what we were given.\n\nAnnnyywayyy yeah teachers can make mistakes too.", "First go in and talk with her face to face.

Hey consequences is ridiculous given the age group.", "NTA", "Yeah, eff that.  NTA.  I too, would have a lot of issues with this teacher.", "NTA Go to the principal. I'm all for supporting teachers, but this is ridiculous.", "NTA - that teacher is being completely ridiculous.

What was he doing, writing out sentences? As the teacher I would ask if he could write a few of the words for each section of spelling, the most easily-missed words, and turn those in so she can assess his understanding.\n\nIf your son cannot spell and thus can\u2019t meet the objective, then the lost notebook is irrelevant and he should do some remediation. If he can spell, problem solved.", "NAH - yet.  I would speak with the teacher, let them know you will replace the notebook, but that your son will not be repeating the work he already did for 12 weeks, as that is excessive.

The part where you\u2019re supposed to be there parent is to help your son with homework but also come up with a reasonable timeline with the teacher for him to redo the missing work.\n\nSchool is about learning. Not just essentials like English, Math, etc. but about socializing with others, accomplishments, discipline, etc..\n\nYour son is being disciples for losing his notebook, and we don\u2019t know what else. You don\u2019t need to escalate to the principal to be a mother/father and just talk to the teacher to understand their perspective and act accordingly.", "YTA.  \n\nThe reason they would want your kid to redo all the work is they need something cumulative to base marks off of.  If I\u2019m the teacher and you refuse to redo the work, your kid gets a \u201cnot meeting expectations\u201d or however their grade system works.  They\u2019re not trying to be jerks, they\u2019re trying to be fair in their assessments.\n\nEdit:  good god the straight up disrespect for teachers in this comment section is disgusting.  Cutting corners and complaining because you don\u2019t want to help is not a good lesson to teach your kid.  So what if they did the work already?  The practice will only help them.  Plus, you keep saying \u201cHE\u2019S SIX\u201d but then you ignore the fact that 6 year olds misplace everything.

I'd definitely make a stink. This teacher is making a terrible decision.", "NTA though I'd like to discuss how well they are graded after words. After all my son had to redo the work. It's the least she can do. If I grade that and she missed anything....", "One of my kids had his consumable math book - that included the tests - stolen from his classroom cubby while he was out sick.  It was \"missing\" for a few weeks until the teacher noticed that another kid in the room, who was terrible academically, started to make 100s on his math tests while still bombing all the assignments leading up to them.  The mother of that kid was a nightmare and I wouldn't have been surprised if she were in on it.  At any rate, my kid wasn't punished at all, maybe because he wasn't even there when it vsnished, and cetainly was not required to go back and re-do the prior work - months' worth at the point.  This os unacceptable and it's definitely possible OP's child didn't even lose his book.  Even if he did, he is six years old, ffs.", "Don't forget to cc the teacher in, lol", "Hahaha!  I completely agree but wonder what recess reimbursement would look like.  I imagine him sitting alone on a swing for 20 min while everyone else lines up and goes inside.  Reimbursement in candy?

I don't think my son should pay for either of our mistakes...especially without my knowledge.", "It mostly likely is his fault.

The kid is six freaking years old. He\u2019s already lost two recesses for this.", "To continue further: as you stated - your kid is only 6 years old! If the teacher misplaced his notebook, I say she won\u2019t admit it. I would have a F2F meeting with this teacher, possibly agree on a compromise that works for both parties, but if she won\u2019t budge on the punishment- then go to the principal. Good luck on this situation.", "What you said makes no sense.  Stop assuming it was the teacher's fault but you also say it may be her fault.  So why should she stop assuming it was possibly the teacher when you clearly say after that it just might be the teacher's fault.", "I specifically said it was either the teacher's fault or my fault.  10 people live here and our house is a disaster area.  It could certainly be my fault, but I specifically remember it didn't come home last week.

She had already written the marks/grades in the lost notebook.  Unless she hadn't recorded them, which would be entirely her fault.  And judging 12 weeks of work that was done all at once would no longer be cumulative nor a good measure of what the child has learned or how they've progressed over 12 weeks.  I consider it purely a spiteful policy at this point.  \"Not meeting expectations\" would be ridiculously inappropriate as the child, up until this point, HAS met all expectations.  Educational expectations have nothing to do with how responsible children are with materials.", "The teacher should have been marking the work at least semi regularly and recording those marks. She wants a child in grade one to do 3 months worth of work because she was not doing her job.", "That's all anyone can ask. I just wanted to make sure, because, honestly, I would totally understand going above her first, if it were my child. It's a lot of punishments for 1 thing, I'd be pretty unhappy.\n\nI hope it works out well!", "Honestly the best thing in this scenario is incremental actions. Discuss calmly, voice your concerns, and try and come to a rational solution that doesn't involve your kid taking undue punishment. If talking to her feels like laying siege to a bulwark, then start climbing the ladder and voicing concerns to the principal.\n\nAlso keeping in mind that this teacher, on the surface, seems petty and authoritative like a cop fresh out of the academy. Going straight over her head might make her zero in on your kid as a target more than she already seemingly has", "At his age, punishment is unacceptable and ineffective for this issue. Even if we accept that it is, the punishment is excessive and punitive. Stand firm and say no.", "Have you talked to the teacher about your concerns about the assignment? You need to give her a chance to hear your opinion and explain her reasons for assigning it this way.  Maybe you can reach a compromise.", "Honestly it sounds to me like she's been lazy and hasn't bothered to grade the spelling book and is now scrambling because she wont have his grades in.  She's punishing the kid because she is irresponsible.", "100% agree with starting here and having an in-depth conversation about multiple things with the teacher (if you haven't already).

I'm so glad your parents had your back. \n\nMy parents were both teachers, good ones. My dad taught in the same district for 40 years, he couldn't go anywhere without an old student coming to say hi and often excitedly introducing their children. Neither ever had a serious complaint lodged or any really negative interaction with parents, even. \n\nWith that said, as I've gotten older I've realized how many truly shitty, awful teachers I had. The guy who bullied me and called me names all semester because he thought I was \"too liberal\".

Then he'd congratulate my boyfriend and ask thinly veiled sexual questions. We were 14.", "Ask your son what he thinks? Seriously, what treat would make up for the loss?

That doesn\u2019t mean she added the marks to her mark book.  For most teachers I know, that is done all at once.

Would throw out his papers until he wrote them the right way.  She didn't even bother teaching him how to do it, or even mentioning it to me.  When I found out, I was livid.

Positive reinforcement, repetition/practice, age-appropriate reminders, etc, are far more effective in creating good habits and fostering a love of learning than bringing in negativity and stress, especially at this age.
