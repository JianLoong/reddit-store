He was staying at our house for a few days just after our first daughter was born. I was driving him to run an errand since he lost his license the previous summer due to a DWI manslaughter charge that resulted in my MIL\u2019s death. Sorry to spill his tea, but I think the background is important. We have never been super close but always cordial for the 6.5 years I\u2019ve been with my wife. I was there with her to post his bail at the jail the night it happened, I went to his first court hearing, I stayed over at his house the first week after it happened. Asked what I could do, ran errands, sat with him to offer any solace while everyone else ran errands, etc.  \n\nFast forward a year later to that car ride. My grandma had just passed away a few days before our daughter was born and while it\u2019s just my FIL and I in the car, he asks,\u201dDo they know what killed your grandma? Did they do an autopsy to see if your mom poisoned her? To get inheritance or something?\u201d I was shocked and just stared at him. My mom is a saint and this guy is just going to postulate on her killing my grandma when she wasn\u2019t even buried in the ground yet ? The rest of the ride was in silence since I was too shocked to respond. \n\nFinally the \u201cputa\u201d incident. Over the course of the next month my newborn daughter is growing, and we\u2019re a happy family. When he\u2019s over and she\u2019s crying or makes a smelly diaper he always says \u201cputa\u201d when he\u2019s the one holding her. \n\nI finally work up the courage to have a 1:1 convo the next time he comes over. I\u2019m not the best at confrontation. It goes well, I tell him I have two issues. 1) the comments he made about my mom possibly poising my grandma was the most offensive and rude thing a person could say after a death in the family. 2) stop saying \u201cputa\u201d to my kid\u2019s face when she does something you don\u2019t like. He said no problem won\u2019t happen again and he didn\u2019t mean to offend. Was nice and cordial. \n\nTwo weeks later we FaceTime him and our daughter starts to cry. First words he greets her with is \u201cPuta!\u201d  \n\nMy wife told me to cool down and not call him. I didn\u2019t listen because I was tired of the reckless disregard he has when talking to me. Being nice wasn\u2019t an option so I called and told him to stop, or if he couldn\u2019t follow my rules regarding my daughter, he wouldn\u2019t be welcome over here anymore to visit her. He said he wasn\u2019t using puta to mean \u201cbitch or whore\u201d but as \u201cshit\u201d was his response . I did no name calling or cursing, but my wife said I was way too aggressive with my tone and now everyone in her family thinks I\u2019m too easily offended.

You may want to ask that you both attend counseling sessions to discuss your takes of family dynamics and responsibilities... She has no idea how bad her family is to be around!", "NTA. Ummm\u2026WTF?! He killed your wife\u2019s mother. Why the F does she still have contact with her dad? That\u2019s where you lost me in this story. Actually\u2026now that I think about it Y T A for even allowing your daughter to have contact with such a person.", "The term \"Too easily offended\" in this situation is just enabling abusive behavior. NTA.", "NTA. I mean my mum called us strumpets sometimes as a joke but\u2026 Jesus Christ. And if he\u2019d commented that about my mother (my nan died a couple of years ago), I would have done something reddit TOS doesn\u2019t like.\n\nYou told him to stop nicely, he carried on. You\u2019re perfectly within your rights to snap at him.", "you are correct.", "Daughter to Chileans and native spanish speaker here. While it does sound like your FIL wasnt calling your daughter a wh*re or sl*t and just cursing like he said, it is still a strong offensive and loaded word (I think the Spanish use it more lightly though but correct me if Im wrong. Dont know about other Spanish speaking cultures) and I wouldn't want it used around my child. NTA", "NTA.\n\nTwo things that are HUGELY concerning about this man\u2019s capacity for empathy:\n- puto/a is a fairly common exclamation in most Latin communities for a variety of things but it is NEVER used around children. My boyfriend\u2019s brother was playing smash bros with their little cousins (3 and 6yo) and one of the character names that flashed by on the screen was \u201cputo\u201d (since as a guy in his mid 20s obviously that\u2019s how he jokes around with his friends), and when the 6yo saw it, immediately ALL of the family in the room (parents, aunt, uncle, cousins, partners) started telling him that it said \u201cPluto,\u201d like Mickey Mouse\u2019s dog, because they would never use that word in front of their child for ANY reason. The fact that your FIL sees no problem in using a swear word, regardless of his intended meaning, in front of YOUR child against  YOUR wishes is unsettling, as well as the fact that that\u2019s his automatic reaction to your child just being an infant.\n- My boyfriend\u2019s father passed away in June in a drowning accident at the beach. The entire family has been absolutely devastated, ESPECIALLY my boyfriend\u2019s mother as his wife. For her one of the hardest things has been dealing with the guilt of not being able to save him or stop him from going out too far. If anyone made some kind of joke or comment about swimming dangerously? I can\u2019t even imagine the kind of reaction that ANYONE in the family would have, but least of all her. In their case, she was not actually responsible for his death, unlike your FIL - and yet he\u2019s going around making jokes.\n\nBased on the fact that his children love him and he used to be an elementary school teacher, it\u2019s possible that he does still have a moral compass but that he has completely emotionally shut down as a result of her death because the thought of coping with her death and his culpability is beyond his mental capacity. Similarly, his gross comments about your mom poisoning your grandma, while some users pointed out could imply that he was projecting his own murderous intentions, might be him trying to not be the \u201cworst\u201d guy, he wants to find solace in the fact that there are people out there worse than him. He clearly had issues before the manslaughter, given its cause as a DWI, but maybe it has made him disconnect from his own identity, feel like he\u2019s a different person, like he can\u2019t reconcile who he was before and after.\n\nI\u2019ve seen in your comments that your wife doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve\u201d in therapy, I\u2019m assuming her dad is the same, but I think they both desperately need it. It might be helpful focusing on getting to the root cause of your wife\u2019s aversion to therapy.", "I am not a native Spanish speaker and even I know that \"puta\" makes the room go silent and everyone turns to look.  Aside from the drama aspect,  it personifies \"bad word\" and is extremely offensive.  And saying that to an innocent baby? Wtf.", "Calling people fat is just offensive and unnecessary. My friend gets called gordita in a \"playful\" manner by her aunts, and then they call her sensitive if she won't pretend it doesn't hurt her. Calling babies whores is also offensive, if you'll believe it.", "It means whore, I just checked with Google translate. Which is important to know, since he's saying it to a little girl.", "This. Puta or hijo/a de puta is equivalent to \"motherfucker!\" like when you stub your toe, not actual mom sex.", "Even then it's still swearing, you usually don't want your children to learn swear words when they are so young.", "Eu sou do Norte.", "At 63 he must have had more than enough gross shits himself. He should be able to keep his mouth shut.", "The way you describe him, he just gives off such horrible vibes. Like, not normal on the emotional and spiritual level. \n\nPeople like that are never just bad in one way. I'd say he's probably dangerous, even if it wasn't for the fact that he killed your MIL. \n\nYour wife and inlaws not appearing to have any boundaries with him is just another warning sign. It means that he's steamrolled them for years. \n\nPlease, don't let your sense of normalcy be affected by your inlaws, and keep putting your daughter first.", "A 4 month reprieve, and then he is back. You need to have a serious conversation with your wife because this is not going to end well. Your wife is putting her father before you and your child, her child.  Even if she refuses therapy, you can go yourself. Start the documentation somewhere.", "Alright dude. Sorry my hyperbole triggered you. \n\nWe can all agree that \n- it\u2019s bad to lie to the police. \n- no one is perfect \n- judicial systems are not perfect\n\nAnd since no one said those things and they weren\u2019t the topic at hand\u2026.\n\nDudes FIL is a fucking asshole who seems to make shit life choices so maybe he should listen when people tell him not to do things. If he doesn\u2019t he might lose more people in his life and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not what he wants after the year he\u2019s had. And I would not allow someone to refer to my child in a derogatory manner. I would be very very mad about it in point of fact.", "NTA stop feeling sorry for the drunk murderer. Kick him out and protect your family.", "Yeah, the FIL is not saying the baby is, well, That. Puta is use in my country like the F word in the USA but still, OP is NTA. You just don\u2019t go around using that language in front of children. Also, wtf with the poisoning comments? Completely out of place!", "I'm sorry but this man seems dangerous to say the least, I'm surprised that this is the straw that broke the camel's back here because there wasn't any good enough reason to keep him around yourself and your child long before that. NTA obviously, but somewhat of an A H to yourself for taking this long to at the very least try to lay down some boundaries. In my opinion and just from what I've read here, this man is legitimately dangerous and shouldn't be allowed you or your family at all. He's clearly not mentally and emotionally stable, he doesn't take accountability, and I don't doubt that there's far darker demons in those murky waters he seemed to be chin deep in. \n\nYou should cut contact entirely and set up a security system at your house to have video recorded evidence for your safety should he ever escalate. Don't respond to me telling me this is overkill or that he would never try to physically hurt you or your child, this man you're describing definitely has the potential to escalate that far.", "PUTA directed at a child is atrocious, our family speaks Spanish and we don't call each other puta. He should go into a bar and call the guy sitting next to him PUTO, grandpa may not come home at all.", "NTA. For the emotional, psychological and physical safety of your daughter, I highly advise you keep the FIL away as he repeatedly violated your boundaries. If he can't be trusted with not drunk driving and killing his wife, I doubt he's any better with your baby. Letting him stay could potentially be a path rife with abuse and I wish your wife could see that. This isn't something to take lightly. I wish you and your family luck!", "NTA your fil is mean...but I need the INFO If he is mexican or romanian... Because I know the word puta in romanian as something that \"stinks.", "NTA, who does that to a kid or says that to a grieving grandson?", "I\u2019m Hispanic and \u201cPuta\u201d really is used like that, Shit! Goddamn! Fuck! Like if you smell a shitty diaper you would say \u201cGoddamn\u201d or \u201cshit\u201d Puta is used just like that it started as \u201cPuta madre\u201d and has just been downsized to Puta almost all Mexicans I know use it this way. It\u2019s an exclamation. You at NTA, the comment made about your mom was rude, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s calling your daughter a bitch/whore. But then again context is everything really gotta be there to judge.", "Those yes, but never just on its own.", "Ent\u00e3o deves estar mais que habituad@ a levar com umas putas que pariram.", "Os palavr\u00f5es no Norte , na realidade, n\u00e3o s\u00e3o muito usados como insultos.\n\nTudo o resto? Sim, at\u00e9 como pontua\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nHabituad@, sim e muito. Usar com crian\u00e7as ao lado, n\u00e3o. Usar como insulto a uma crian\u00e7a, muito menos.", "Honduran", "I am not a Spanish speaker so I doubt I have the linguistic and cultural competence to adequately address the \u201cputa\u201d incident and I am not even going to attempt to do so here. That said, I actually think the \u201cputa\u201d thing sounds like the least offensive thing this person has done that you mentioned. He sounds dangerously unhinged and I would worry a little about my infant child being around this person at all from your description. To hear you tell it, this person accused your mother of a capital crime with no basis while you are grieving your grandmother\u2019s death and he drove while drunk and basically murdered someone in the process. With a toxic person like this it will always be something. I get that this is your wife\u2019s father, but you don\u2019t want toxic influences around you and your child either so I would talk to my wife about potentially at the least seriously limiting contact with this individual. He\u2019s a deadly menace to society and his own family as proven by the drunken car murder incident. Honestly, I think you may be focusing on the \u201cputa\u201d incident and ignoring the larger issue - this man is completely off his rocker and has even killed people. You need to protect your child from this person and get him out of your life as much as possible just based on general principle.", "NTA. I'd just start calling him Maric\u00f3n when your daughter isn't there. It's offensive AF in general but a macho dude would especially dislike it.", "Pend*jo is a good one for for him. NTA. Daughter comes first.", "NTA", "Yeah, I almost feel like the OP may not want to deal with the bigger issues here so he\u2019s picking a fight about things that are relatively minor compared to the much more serious issues going on here. Maybe OP needs to have a heart to heart talk with his wife about how the family has normalized this man being a murderer and a dangerous drunk and insulting OP\u2019s mother for no reason. Why can\u2019t the OP\u2019s wife realize how abnormal and wrong all of that is? I think the folks saying to document everything and to prepare to sue for full custody have a point. As often happens on AITA, the lede was sort of buried here. If this was just about the puta thing, it could be that OP was overreacting. But this guy is a danger to society and his family members wind up dead because of him and he assumes other people go around committing murder too since it\u2019s his personal pastime. I also think the person who thinks drinking may have fried this man\u2019s aging brain raises an important possibility. That would explain a lot and also underscore how dangerous this guy could be around a child for reasons that have nothing to do with vulgarity.", "I suspect you\u2019re right about the language issues even though I don\u2019t speak Spanish. To me, the \u201cputa\u201d thing is a moot point because it\u2019s easily the least serious issue with this dangerous homicidal drunk.", "That\u2019s a good point. This dangerous man should never have been allowed to meet the child to call her anything after all that transpired that had no relation to her. My gut tells me that OP recognizes this but doesn\u2019t feel like he can draw that boundary now because he didn\u2019t before so he has decided the vulgarity thing is the hill he wants to die on. I\u2019d forget about the \u201cputa\u201d stuff and have a talk with your wife about how you\u2019ve reassessed things and realized that this guy is a homicidal drunk you don\u2019t trust around your child. Concede the language issue if it makes it easier to focus on what really matters here which is how dangerous and imbalanced this guy is overall.", "Exactly! Saying Puta is the least of this guy\u2019s problems!", "If I was ops wife I\u2019d be pissed off he killed his wife, possibly the mother of the wife. \n\nI\u2019d have cut off all contact the first incident.", "I'm from Spain and I have never heard anyone just randomly exclaim \"puta\" to express frustration. Maybe mutter \"su puta madre\" when something goes wrong, or \"me cago en la puta\" but it's not like French or Polish where the word \"whore\" is used as a random swearword without the intent of actually calling someone a whore.", "Probably because the FILs just straight up murder people. Less victims to report their activity.", "Is there a one for brothers/siblings in law? The things I could post about my fiance's \"brother\"...", "NTA. Puta literally means whore. It does not mean shit. And, even if it meant that, he still has no business  calling your child names.\nEdit for judgement.", "NTA and you should consider going nc. WTF is wrong with him, how he can be so easily saying that to a baby?! He doesn't respect your daughter, keep him away from her.", "NTA He is disgusting. It's almost like he is greeting her with it or using it as nickname and the word doesn't mean shit just because he uses it that way, what to do id your in public and he says it", "I shouldn't've laughed at this \ud83e\udd2d\n\nAlso, yes", "I don't think for bil, but r/JUSTNOSIL does - best bet would probably be r/JUSTNOFAMILY for BIL\n\nSorry you have a JustNo :/", "It's really weird how it's only been a few days since this man killed someone, drunk driving or not his actions led to the death of another person, and he's so casual about it. He so casually drops this idea that someone could have committed murder as if it's a normal thought or as if he's talking about where to go for lunch.\n\nAm I correct in reading this that two people died? He was driving the car that killed the mother in law, that was ruled as his fault, and then a year later the grandmother dies and he suggests she was poisoned intentionally? Did OP tell the police what he said about the grandmother and his odd interest in whether they did an autopsy? It sounds to me like this man is doing these things intentionally and trying to insert his agenda, his narrative, into his family's minds to control them and the ones he can't control he's getting rid of them.\n\n/u/zebra1084 I don't think your issue is the language this man is using. I think he's legitimately dangerous."]}
