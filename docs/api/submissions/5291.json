He was staying at our house for a few days just after our first daughter was born. I was driving him to run an errand since he lost his license the previous summer due to a DWI manslaughter charge that resulted in my MIL\u2019s death. Sorry to spill his tea, but I think the background is important. We have never been super close but always cordial for the 6.5 years I\u2019ve been with my wife. I was there with her to post his bail at the jail the night it happened, I went to his first court hearing, I stayed over at his house the first week after it happened. Asked what I could do, ran errands, sat with him to offer any solace while everyone else ran errands, etc.  \n\nFast forward a year later to that car ride. My grandma had just passed away a few days before our daughter was born and while it\u2019s just my FIL and I in the car, he asks,\u201dDo they know what killed your grandma? Did they do an autopsy to see if your mom poisoned her? To get inheritance or something?\u201d I was shocked and just stared at him. My mom is a saint and this guy is just going to postulate on her killing my grandma when she wasn\u2019t even buried in the ground yet ? The rest of the ride was in silence since I was too shocked to respond. \n\nFinally the \u201cputa\u201d incident. Over the course of the next month my newborn daughter is growing, and we\u2019re a happy family. When he\u2019s over and she\u2019s crying or makes a smelly diaper he always says \u201cputa\u201d when he\u2019s the one holding her. \n\nI finally work up the courage to have a 1:1 convo the next time he comes over. I\u2019m not the best at confrontation. It goes well, I tell him I have two issues. 1) the comments he made about my mom possibly poising my grandma was the most offensive and rude thing a person could say after a death in the family. 2) stop saying \u201cputa\u201d to my kid\u2019s face when she does something you don\u2019t like. He said no problem won\u2019t happen again and he didn\u2019t mean to offend. Was nice and cordial. \n\nTwo weeks later we FaceTime him and our daughter starts to cry. First words he greets her with is \u201cPuta!\u201d  \n\nMy wife told me to cool down and not call him. I didn\u2019t listen because I was tired of the reckless disregard he has when talking to me. Being nice wasn\u2019t an option so I called and told him to stop, or if he couldn\u2019t follow my rules regarding my daughter, he wouldn\u2019t be welcome over here anymore to visit her. He said he wasn\u2019t using puta to mean \u201cbitch or whore\u201d but as \u201cshit\u201d was his response . I did no name calling or cursing, but my wife said I was way too aggressive with my tone and now everyone in her family thinks I\u2019m too easily offended.
