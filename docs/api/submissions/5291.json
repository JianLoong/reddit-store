He was staying at our house for a few days just after our first daughter was born. I was driving him to run an errand since he lost his license the previous summer due to a DWI manslaughter charge that resulted in my MIL\u2019s death. Sorry to spill his tea, but I think the background is important. We have never been super close but always cordial for the 6.5 years I\u2019ve been with my wife. I was there with her to post his bail at the jail the night it happened, I went to his first court hearing, I stayed over at his house the first week after it happened. Asked what I could do, ran errands, sat with him to offer any solace while everyone else ran errands, etc.  \n\nFast forward a year later to that car ride. My grandma had just passed away a few days before our daughter was born and while it\u2019s just my FIL and I in the car, he asks,\u201dDo they know what killed your grandma? Did they do an autopsy to see if your mom poisoned her? To get inheritance or something?\u201d I was shocked and just stared at him. My mom is a saint and this guy is just going to postulate on her killing my grandma when she wasn\u2019t even buried in the ground yet ? The rest of the ride was in silence since I was too shocked to respond. \n\nFinally the \u201cputa\u201d incident. Over the course of the next month my newborn daughter is growing, and we\u2019re a happy family. When he\u2019s over and she\u2019s crying or makes a smelly diaper he always says \u201cputa\u201d when he\u2019s the one holding her. \n\nI finally work up the courage to have a 1:1 convo the next time he comes over. I\u2019m not the best at confrontation. It goes well, I tell him I have two issues. 1) the comments he made about my mom possibly poising my grandma was the most offensive and rude thing a person could say after a death in the family. 2) stop saying \u201cputa\u201d to my kid\u2019s face when she does something you don\u2019t like. He said no problem won\u2019t happen again and he didn\u2019t mean to offend. Was nice and cordial. \n\nTwo weeks later we FaceTime him and our daughter starts to cry. First words he greets her with is \u201cPuta!\u201d  \n\nMy wife told me to cool down and not call him. I didn\u2019t listen because I was tired of the reckless disregard he has when talking to me. Being nice wasn\u2019t an option so I called and told him to stop, or if he couldn\u2019t follow my rules regarding my daughter, he wouldn\u2019t be welcome over here anymore to visit her. He said he wasn\u2019t using puta to mean \u201cbitch or whore\u201d but as \u201cshit\u201d was his response . I did no name calling or cursing, but my wife said I was way too aggressive with my tone and now everyone in her family thinks I\u2019m too easily offended.

It\u2019s a simple enough concept for FiL and co. to respect.\n\nSo yes. We agree NTA. But the context of the word choice is irrelevant here.", "but that doesn\u2019t make sense to say puta while answering a call right away to a ft baby", "Yes, and I routinely curse \"Verfickte Schei\u00dfe\" when something annoying happens, but I would still not curse like that around a baby.", "That's a fun solution.  OP needs to hone his chancla throwing skills and treat FIL like the insolent brat he's being.", "He killed her mother and she still defends him? Your wife is also TA.", "Is your wife\u2019s attitude not extremely concerning to you? I\u2019d be worried that she\u2019ll disregard your wishes when you\u2019re not around. \n\nIs your wife in therapy? Either for her father\u2019s alcoholism or her mother\u2019s death?", "It can be used the way FIL said, though. Still cuss word not apt for children.", "You get to set the rules for your child and I think not using that word around her is completely reasonable.", " It\u2019s a curse word for us.", "No. The guy sounds super sleazy. He\u2019s clearly disgusted by the baby, and he killed his wife driving drunk. That\u2019s why I said NTA. Why would anyone want that guy around their kid? He\u2019s just not calling the infant a prostitute.", "I'd say kill somebody but that ship has already sailed.", "But \"puta\" as a short version of \"puta madre\" is used all the time. Maybe we are from different Argentinas (Argen and Tina ?)", "[The Secret of La Chancla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSicdnahJ7o)", "He probably was. It's commonly used as a synonym for shit. I've heard plenty of friends say it in this way.", "OP, NTA\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing, he\u2019s saying a curse word every time she\u2019s a baby near him. \n\nThat\u2019s like saying \u201coh shit\u201d everytime you breathe, or \u201cwhoreson\u201d everytime your wife drinks water. \n\nHe\u2019s cursing every time the baby does something  a baby does.  If it continues as she grows, she will think everything she does near grandpa  is wrong which can lean to some internalized issues. \n\nThis man should probably not be around babies or children.", "Same with my culture (Central American). But the original comment I was replying to generalized it so I went with it.", "I say 'puta madre!' daily when dealing with campers in call of duty. I'd never think about saying it in the presence of my family, specially my nieces. It's fucked up.", "My dude: my dad was a major alcoholic back in his heyday and if he ever did what your FIL did or hurt anyone because of his actions, I would\u2019ve been out of his life ASAP. And I\u2019m his golden child. Your wife isn\u2019t his defender. She\u2019s his enabler. She lost another parent because of his actions. How she parents your daughter and future children needs to be more or less scrutinized because the whole game has changed. She has birthed children that are innocent and need to be taken care of. And you\u2019re stepping up so far awesomely. I hope all goes well for the two of you. Much love \ud83d\udc96", "There are a lot of alcoholics in my family on both sides. I'm very familiar with its cycle of addiction, I've been very forgiving of family struggling with the disease.\n\nIf any of them talked about looking forward to picking up their habit after they did something as terrible as what your FIL did, I would go NC.", "As a south american, female spanish speaker myself, it is true \"puta\" is a term itself, like an interjection we use sometimes mostly when in pain or amazement even. It's still an ugly word not for children ears. FIL is the A-hole.", "Good lord that's messed up. Good job setting boundaries with him around your kid early", "More like the paleta. That wooden spoon HURT like a mother effer."]}
