I am currently 20 years old and my mom is planning a trip to Paris. It will consist of me, my mom, dad, two brothers and 2 family friends. One of those family friends is my age and we are really close. I only recently learned that she also had a dream about going to Paris. When my mom told me about the trip I was over the moon with excitement! But I soon learned my mom didn\u2019t really care how excited a was but more about my friends excitement. That\u2019s all my mom would talk about- how excited my friend was to see the Eiffel Tower, and how she wants to eat so many desserts. But when I mention these things she either ignores me or asks like I\u2019m weirdly obsessed with Paris. When I ask questions she shuts me down and when I say how excited I am to go to Paris with my friend she just treats it like no big deal. Like I\u2019m not about to live my dream. It makes me feel jealous and think that I\u2019m being a bad daughter for even expressing excitement.

When you constantly hear about something from someone close to you, it becomes white noise.  While at the same time, hearing about a similar thing from someone else can seem novel.  \n\nThink about it this way.  Lets say you heard your brothers talking about Call of Duty (or whatever video game they play, if they play) constantly.  AT some point, even though they were super excited, you'd tune it out.  If a random cousin or family friend talked about it, you may take the time to listen more and express more curiousity about it.  Even though it is essentially the same thing.", "I kind of get where you're coming from. NTA for being a little irritated that your mom (weirdly imo) cares more about how your friend feels but you really don't need your mom to validate your excitement. Talk to your friends about how excited you are, research some things you'd like to do, and ignore the other bs. Go, document your journey and have fun!", "INFO I don\u2019t know if you are an asshole but I did think you were 14-16 years old until I looked more carefully. At 20, I think you\u2019ve got to start weaning yourself from needing this level of validation from your mom. I mean you are excited yes? You get to go to Paris? Why do you need her to acknowledge that you are excited?\n\nI\u2019m also struggling to understand what these conversations are going like in terms of words, tone, and frequency so it\u2019s hard to tell if your mother is deliberately trying to shut you down or if you are over interpreting.", "Nah. \n\nI mean, you are talking about Paris for 17 years, It became obvious that you like It, your friend Is something new.", "NAH\n\nYou need to let your excitement be your own. You're not the center of the world. Your parents are excited for your friend, has she had some sort of difficulty in her life? Feels like there is a piece of the puzzle missing.", "INFO You are 20, did you communicate with your mom? Did you try talking, explaining how you feel when she dismisses your excitement for someone else's excitement? You have mouth, so talk. Maybe you discover what is actually annoying your mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
