Max does house chores as he likes things tidy, and cooks too, since he is a very picky eater. I do stuff like getting groceries etc.\n\nMax went no contact with his family since his teen years, so my family is all we have. We go to family dinners, BBQs, etc, we just never host because our apartment is small. My family had an issue with how we handled things for our engagement and wedding. Max and I don't have rings, one day he just casually asked if I wanted to go to the courthouse so I could legally take his name, I said yes, and that was it. My dad, particularly, had this crazy wedding dream for me, where he would walk me down the aisle, etc, I can tell he has not forgiven that the dream was taken away from him, but we are happy so who cares?.\n\nToday, we went to get lunch with my parents and extended family for a cousin's birthday, his mom, my 57yo aunt, started asking Max a lot of questions that were very nosy, like if we were having trouble getting pregnant, or if he had a job. I could tell my husband was annoyed so I stepped in and changed the topic, but as soon as I went away to help in the kitchen, my aunt started harrassing my husband with stupid questions about our house, our lack of rings, implying he didn't make enough money for such things, and that he had to compensate this by doing chores. When I went back to him, Max was seriously upset, still wanting to be polite by keeping quiet, yet my aunt was not done, babbling about his son (the birthday boy) and how he was making 200k+ a year and how she expected her own salary to be raised this year, to which I replied:\n\n\"Gee, I am so happy you have a job you love, can't see myself getting a rise at that age, not even working in fact!, we expect to be reading and sleeping in by the time we turn 40, guess we are just so lazy that an early retirement is the only thing we aspire to\"\n\nMax looked so pleased it was worth the sour look on my aunt's face, she went away immediately, to tell my dad right away, he came up to us to demand we apologize or leave right away, to which we grabbed the second option with my husband stating we would not want to upset our gracious host.

That is not the best way to respond to the aunt that is harassing your husband.
