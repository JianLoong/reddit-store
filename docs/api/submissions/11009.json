{"id": 11009, "submission_id": "11cyjvs", "title": "AITA for being sarcastic to a rude relative for looking down on my husband?", "selftext": "My husband Max and I (28 & 26) are the day and the night. For some context: Max is rather quiet, serious, and sometimes a tad antisocial, I on the other hand love to meet new people, sometimes struggle to get organized, and in general, while he is all smartness, I'm the dodo, that gives you an idea on how our household runs, lol.\n\nWhile we have the means for something on the bigger side (he does accounting, I do marketing), we have decided to settle in a tiny apartment, very cozy and clean, since we don't want children, and a big house is pointless. Max does house chores as he likes things tidy, and cooks too, since he is a very picky eater. I do stuff like getting groceries etc.\n\nMax went no contact with his family since his teen years, so my family is all we have. We go to family dinners, BBQs, etc, we just never host because our apartment is small. My family had an issue with how we handled things for our engagement and wedding. Max and I don't have rings, one day he just casually asked if I wanted to go to the courthouse so I could legally take his name, I said yes, and that was it. My dad, particularly, had this crazy wedding dream for me, where he would walk me down the aisle, etc, I can tell he has not forgiven that the dream was taken away from him, but we are happy so who cares?.\n\nToday, we went to get lunch with my parents and extended family for a cousin's birthday, his mom, my 57yo aunt, started asking Max a lot of questions that were very nosy, like if we were having trouble getting pregnant, or if he had a job. I could tell my husband was annoyed so I stepped in and changed the topic, but as soon as I went away to help in the kitchen, my aunt started harrassing my husband with stupid questions about our house, our lack of rings, implying he didn't make enough money for such things, and that he had to compensate this by doing chores. When I went back to him, Max was seriously upset, still wanting to be polite by keeping quiet, yet my aunt was not done, babbling about his son (the birthday boy) and how he was making 200k+ a year and how she expected her own salary to be raised this year, to which I replied:\n\n\"Gee, I am so happy you have a job you love, can't see myself getting a rise at that age, not even working in fact!, we expect to be reading and sleeping in by the time we turn 40, guess we are just so lazy that an early retirement is the only thing we aspire to\"\n\nMax looked so pleased it was worth the sour look on my aunt's face, she went away immediately, to tell my dad right away, he came up to us to demand we apologize or leave right away, to which we grabbed the second option with my husband stating we would not want to upset our gracious host. After we left we started getting nasty messages from my cousins and my parents, demanding an apology to my aunt for \"ruining the party\".

She had no business nor right to question or more like integrate him about his job, what he makes, what your plans are. If that ruined her entire party, she needs to get over herself.

Keep living your best married life", "NTA, your aunt was way out of line, and it sounds like your dad isn't that dissimilar in that regard.

That is not the best way to respond to the aunt that is harassing your husband. She was being nosy and opinionated and the best way to deal with that is to say that that is personal and we prefer not to discuss it with you. If she contimues after that then you can ignore her questions or just say 'Wow\". Maybe for the sake of family peace you can apologize but also tell her in the future that these topics are not up for discussion at family get-togethers or any other time.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nThis was a cousin's birthday gathering. Not the time or place for you and your Aunt to be bickering and scoreboarding each other about whose lifestyle is correct/best/amazing. \n\nYour husband surely is capable of 1) removing himself from interacting with rude people or 2) changing the topic. No one is obligated to answer or even listen to intrusive personal questions.\n\nI don't think an insincere apology is necessary or helpful. Just don't take the bait in the future and end up rude yourself.", "You're literally the only YTA comment.

Glad you two are happy together and that you don\u2019t let extended family make the rules", "Adding info because your comment does have a point:\n\nMy husband prefers to avoid conflicts with my family. He knows he's lacking on the social field, and that they would judge his every answer, especially if it comes out as too cold, hence he just shuts up and waits for me to do the talking, since they are my relatives", "NTA.  Sounded fine to me, and if it upset her, that's just too bad.", "It sort of sucks that he just asked you to go to the courthouse to be Mrs. Him, but if you\u2019re cool with it, eh. NAH.", "NTA. Your family are really asking to be next on the NC chopping block: and your aunt is, and (frankly) your father is, appalling and mannerless boors. Ask yourself honestly: Would you really miss them when, not if, you cut them off?", "NTA", "NTA. Why is it that the older, and should definitely know better family member are never the ones that are expected to apologize after they start the issues with their questions/opinions/my way is the correct way after their rudeness backfires on them and someone gets snarky? The aunt should be the one apologizing, not OP.", "NTA\n\nI would have smacked her silly for saying that to my partner so kudos to you for having the self restraint! I\u2019d go LC or NC for a while with them if it were me but I\u2019m petty AF", "NTA, but you need to tell your parents what actually happened because I can promise she told them something different.", "You two sound absolutely delightful. NTA and you handled that with more wit and tact than your family was probably even capable of processing at the time.", "Nta", "Your aunt was determined to show that everything you and your husband did was wrong.  It didn't work that way, so she got pissed. Too bad. \n\nFYI, hubby and I have been married 46 years. We got married in our church but did not invite family. Had a reception the next week for family and friends. I don't wear my wedding ring because it doesn't fit. He doesn't wear his because he is a welder by trade. Does it make one bit of difference? No. Do any of our relatives care? Not one bit because it is literally none of their business. Ignore the self-entitled idiots. They don't deserve any apologies for being snobs.", "NTA, you and your husband seem uncommonly well suited for each other and I know you will achieve that early retirement and enjoy your life together immensely. I wish you every happiness \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nThat aunt had it coming, honestly I have no idea why people care about sharing all of their personal details. It's one thing to be proud of your kid, but when you only are using it to rub it in someone else's face you are the biggest kind of jerk. It really shows how unhappy a person she is.", " I can promise she told them something different."]}
