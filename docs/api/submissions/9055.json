I have 2 contractors who are very close friends of mine.  I offered to remodel her bathroom 5 months ago but her husband declined.  Then a month before she was due, they asked if we could do it.  I scheduled it with contractors, even though she was very close to her due date.  (We told her she should wait).  Regardless, she wanted to move forward.  \n\nWe started on Saturday and Wednesday night she tells us she is being induced the next day.  We work as fast as we can and get to the point where we are hooking the toilet back up and ready to set the tub.  Then my contractor that does the plumbing gets covid.  So with a newborn at home by Saturday, I don't want him in the house obviously. So daughter and husband come home Saturday morning and I suppose the guys didn't sweep well enough so she loses her shit and starts crying about how the bathroom isn't done and the house is a wreck.  Spoiler: They live in filth, it was always a wreck.  \n\nAnyways, I wait til Monday to reach out to her to see if we can come over to finish.  She tells me they already have a guy coming to install the toilet and that she would like her car keys back.  I drive over to drop off the keys, and her husband is waiting for me at the door.  He grabs the keys and slams the door in my face. Okay, so my daughter texts me later that day and says that she's going to have a contractor finish the rest because we lied to her about the timeline and I am holding this project over her head.  I am furious now, so I calmly tell her that I will be back that day to pick up anything that hasn't been installed and they can finish as they see fit. \n\n I figure, if her husband can slam a door in my face when I am trying to gift a 10-15k remodel to them, then I don't need to supply materials for this anymore and they can figure it out.  He then texts me \"F#$% you you ruined my paternity time.  I want nothing to do with you.  You'll never see your granddaughters again.\" (a longer string of insults but you get the picture.). I calmly responded to him that it sucks to use your kids as a weapon on their grandparents, but he had to do what he had to do.  Now his mom is calling us because they cannot afford the remodel AND he stays off from work like planned.  My thought is why should I gift anything to a guy to who I've already given 10's of thousands of assistance when he talks to me like that?  I feel like I'd be a chump. \n\nAlso, side note, we offered to have them stay with us while the bathroom was being completed.

Yet when unexpected things happen and the remodel takes longer than expected he's TA? How exactly does that math add up?", "If this feels like unusual behavior from them, I feel like you should cut them some slack. Usually if doctors are inducing a mother before her due date it means they are doing it for the health of the mother and/or the baby (meaning there are possible complications they are trying to avoid). That is super stressful and scary for both mother and father. Coming home to a (somewhat) unexpected construction site with a new born when you are sleep deprived, hormonal, and trying to heal (both mentally and physically) from a risky birth. They weren't paying attention to the bathroom. They are grateful for it, but at this moment they honestly don't give a shit about it because they have a tiny human they are trying to keep alive. They also probably care because mom is post birth, so she needs easy access to a bathroom and to probably minimize her time on the stairs. But now, she has to go downstairs every time she has to pee. Which is often, because pregnancy/post pregnancy means your muscles are all strained and your bladder has shrunk.\n\n\n\nAnd ok, so the timing messed up, why didn't you personally get the place cleaned up? Like if my daughter was coming home from the hospital with my newborn grandbaby, and I knew for a fact the contractors had cleaned up, I would (at a minimum) go run the vacuum again all over the house and see if there was anything I could do to help prep things for their arrival. See my first paragraph. They are already dealing with all that and they come home to construction debris... come on, you would be pissed too. And now, in order to be able to use their bathroom in a timely fashion (since 2+ weeks is a long time to have to wait for your frie d to test negative), they have to spend a bunch of money on a plumber.

I also wouldn't leave my materials and I definitely would not finish the bathroom.\n\nHowever, if this is abnormal for your daughter I'd be straight with her that her behavior was disrespectful and you deserve an apology.

They have another fully functional bathroom and OP warned his daughter there wasn\u2019t enough time a month before her due date but she insisted", "Info:  Are you the daughter or a teenager who\u2019s never gone through a remodel/construction?\n\nThe daughter and husband\u2019s lack of planning is the reason it was filthy and unfinished.  There\u2019s almost always unexpected delays in construction and remodels.   If they were paying a premium to get it done on time they might have an argument, but the entire job was free.  What a bunch of choosing beggars.", "Did you mean\u2026 cray cray?", "Exactly, and it sounds like she's dealing with a major AH husband too", "If you think describing the hubs as potentially abusive based on this post is a load of crap, you might want to seriously reflect on your past or current relationship dynamics.", "He sounds abusive. Does your daughter seem withdrawn? Has her personality changed since meeting him? Does she ever have mysterious marks, wear seasonably inappropriate clothing (long sleeves or pants in Summer)? Has she started dressing differently since meeting him, maybe more conservative?", "Then I would keep a close eye on the situation, because that shits not normal or acceptable. He sounds low-key abusive.", "Absolutely agree.", "I\u2019m commenting because he talks like a narcissist, which is why I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s the victim here.", "There were just too many things he said that were red flags and the working bathroom was downstairs. I\u2019ve never had kids but that doesn\u2019t sound convenient with a newborn. He ultimately was the one who agreed. He ultimately was the one who failed to stick to the timeline. I don\u2019t believe it was \u201cjust a little messy\u201d. I just get such strong narcissist vibes from this post. His reaction was not proportional. It reminds me exactly how my dad would describe an incident he caused where he would downplay all the negative things he did and spin it so he was the victim.", "Can confirm I sobbed uncontrollably for no real reason a couple of days after giving birth both times.", "I mean it says she lost her shit and screamed at her dad about the floor being a little dirty after they swept.", "From one abused child to another, you're not seeing red flags, you're projecting. My therapist called it \"seeing Boogeymen\" as shorthand. Basically, those of us with trauma think we're super sensitive to the traits and patterns of people like our tormentors, but we actually just have a very strong confirmation bias towards believing people are like what's been indelibly inked in our brains. It's also very common among cops and social workers. Objectively, the dude definitely had some poor word choices and some background on previous interactions is needed, but there isn't anywhere near enough info to actually confirm your \"vibes\".", "This is normal and caused by hormonal changes following birth.", "Not really? How do we know that the floor being dirty isn\u2019t a trigger for the husband\u2019s temper?\n\nI know my ex would lose the few brain cells he had and I\u2019d end up with bruises, if the floor hadn\u2019t been swept before he got home.\n\nSo yeah, I was militant about no shoes inside and swept a million times\u2026 I would have been seen as psycho over it, but it was that or cop a punch?", "But if she's a nesting mom who was about to be induced...I think I could potentially give her some slack. But I wasn't there.", "That\u2019s why I went with ESH instead of YTA, I just didn\u2019t give him the benefit of the doubt because of the verbiage he used, or I would have gone with NAH. But I disagree with you, him not caring about making a mess because the house was \u201calready a mess\u201d, him holding it over her head, him being furious at her, him taking back the supplies because she\u2019s upset, that is definitely enough to give a vibe about this guy.", "Hope you have your cake and get to eat it too! \ud83c\udf70\ud83d\ude0b", "I guess only the OP can tell us if his daughter typically treats him with respect or if she's usually rude and short-tempered over other things as well.", "And she\u2019s just arrived home with a newborn. By no means am I someone who gives pregnant women or new mothers a free pass, but seriously - she has a baby (who is 72 hours old at most) in her arms and clearly stressed, hormonal and all the rest of it.", "I say this as a woman who gave birth in the middle of a free bathroom remodel by my father-in-law that took 4 months longer than I was told... she's still in the wrong. Could it be understandable given circumstances? Sure. Would I have instantly apologized to the man providing me free labor? Yes.\n\nEdit: I gave birth at a hospital but the bathroom remodel was in progress \ud83e\udd23", "Read the OP replies, there was another bathroom in the house.", "Fair enough!", "Just to add OP, if you still care for your daughter, you should check up on her mental health as well. Not suggesting it is the case here, but I recently read another AITA thread that post partum depression / anxiety / psychosis is a real thing and may be affecting your child to think, feel, and act rationally.\n\nNTA here, but your daughter's husband is def TA for being rude to you. I know he's also under a lot of stress with the baby coming but pushing away people who wanted to help is not a smart move, and he didn't just push out a baby from is d*** so he has no excuse. I hope he steps up as the dad of that household instead of opening the blame hose on everyone.\n\nWishing this still gets better for you, if not soon, then someday.\n\nPS - did you push through pulling out the leftover materials? I didn't see if it was explicitly said, or maybe I'm just dumb. \ud83d\ude05"]}
