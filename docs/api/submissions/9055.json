I have 2 contractors who are very close friends of mine.  I offered to remodel her bathroom 5 months ago but her husband declined.  Then a month before she was due, they asked if we could do it.  I scheduled it with contractors, even though she was very close to her due date.  (We told her she should wait).  Regardless, she wanted to move forward.  \n\nWe started on Saturday and Wednesday night she tells us she is being induced the next day.  We work as fast as we can and get to the point where we are hooking the toilet back up and ready to set the tub.  Then my contractor that does the plumbing gets covid.  So with a newborn at home by Saturday, I don't want him in the house obviously. So daughter and husband come home Saturday morning and I suppose the guys didn't sweep well enough so she loses her shit and starts crying about how the bathroom isn't done and the house is a wreck.  Spoiler: They live in filth, it was always a wreck.  \n\nAnyways, I wait til Monday to reach out to her to see if we can come over to finish.  She tells me they already have a guy coming to install the toilet and that she would like her car keys back.  I drive over to drop off the keys, and her husband is waiting for me at the door.  He grabs the keys and slams the door in my face. Okay, so my daughter texts me later that day and says that she's going to have a contractor finish the rest because we lied to her about the timeline and I am holding this project over her head.  I am furious now, so I calmly tell her that I will be back that day to pick up anything that hasn't been installed and they can finish as they see fit. \n\n I figure, if her husband can slam a door in my face when I am trying to gift a 10-15k remodel to them, then I don't need to supply materials for this anymore and they can figure it out.  He then texts me \"F#$% you you ruined my paternity time.  I want nothing to do with you.  You'll never see your granddaughters again.\" (a longer string of insults but you get the picture.). I calmly responded to him that it sucks to use your kids as a weapon on their grandparents, but he had to do what he had to do.  Now his mom is calling us because they cannot afford the remodel AND he stays off from work like planned.  My thought is why should I gift anything to a guy to who I've already given 10's of thousands of assistance when he talks to me like that?  I feel like I'd be a chump. \n\nAlso, side note, we offered to have them stay with us while the bathroom was being completed.

Yet when unexpected things happen and the remodel takes longer than expected he's TA? How exactly does that math add up?", "If this feels like unusual behavior from them, I feel like you should cut them some slack. Usually if doctors are inducing a mother before her due date it means they are doing it for the health of the mother and/or the baby (meaning there are possible complications they are trying to avoid). That is super stressful and scary for both mother and father. Coming home to a (somewhat) unexpected construction site with a new born when you are sleep deprived, hormonal, and trying to heal (both mentally and physically) from a risky birth. They weren't paying attention to the bathroom. They are grateful for it, but at this moment they honestly don't give a shit about it because they have a tiny human they are trying to keep alive. They also probably care because mom is post birth, so she needs easy access to a bathroom and to probably minimize her time on the stairs. But now, she has to go downstairs every time she has to pee. Which is often, because pregnancy/post pregnancy means your muscles are all strained and your bladder has shrunk.\n\n\n\nAnd ok, so the timing messed up, why didn't you personally get the place cleaned up? Like if my daughter was coming home from the hospital with my newborn grandbaby, and I knew for a fact the contractors had cleaned up, I would (at a minimum) go run the vacuum again all over the house and see if there was anything I could do to help prep things for their arrival. See my first paragraph. They are already dealing with all that and they come home to construction debris... come on, you would be pissed too. And now, in order to be able to use their bathroom in a timely fashion (since 2+ weeks is a long time to have to wait for your frie d to test negative), they have to spend a bunch of money on a plumber.

I also wouldn't leave my materials and I definitely would not finish the bathroom.\n\nHowever, if this is abnormal for your daughter I'd be straight with her that her behavior was disrespectful and you deserve an apology.
