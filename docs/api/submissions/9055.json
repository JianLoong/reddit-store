I have 2 contractors who are very close friends of mine.  I offered to remodel her bathroom 5 months ago but her husband declined.  Then a month before she was due, they asked if we could do it.  I scheduled it with contractors, even though she was very close to her due date.  (We told her she should wait).  Regardless, she wanted to move forward.  \n\nWe started on Saturday and Wednesday night she tells us she is being induced the next day.  We work as fast as we can and get to the point where we are hooking the toilet back up and ready to set the tub.  Then my contractor that does the plumbing gets covid.  So with a newborn at home by Saturday, I don't want him in the house obviously. So daughter and husband come home Saturday morning and I suppose the guys didn't sweep well enough so she loses her shit and starts crying about how the bathroom isn't done and the house is a wreck.  Spoiler: They live in filth, it was always a wreck.  \n\nAnyways, I wait til Monday to reach out to her to see if we can come over to finish.  She tells me they already have a guy coming to install the toilet and that she would like her car keys back.  I drive over to drop off the keys, and her husband is waiting for me at the door.  He grabs the keys and slams the door in my face. Okay, so my daughter texts me later that day and says that she's going to have a contractor finish the rest because we lied to her about the timeline and I am holding this project over her head.  I am furious now, so I calmly tell her that I will be back that day to pick up anything that hasn't been installed and they can finish as they see fit. \n\n I figure, if her husband can slam a door in my face when I am trying to gift a 10-15k remodel to them, then I don't need to supply materials for this anymore and they can figure it out.  He then texts me \"F#$% you you ruined my paternity time.  I want nothing to do with you.  You'll never see your granddaughters again.\" (a longer string of insults but you get the picture.). I calmly responded to him that it sucks to use your kids as a weapon on their grandparents, but he had to do what he had to do.  Now his mom is calling us because they cannot afford the remodel AND he stays off from work like planned.  My thought is why should I gift anything to a guy to who I've already given 10's of thousands of assistance when he talks to me like that?  I feel like I'd be a chump. \n\nAlso, side note, we offered to have them stay with us while the bathroom was being completed.  It would have been done 3 days later than expected.", "created_utc": 1675456206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10sud8l/aita_for_starting_a_bathroom_remodel_for_my/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were doing huge favor and I would love you to remodel my bathroom for free lol.  \n\nHave they never had a remodel done before?  Things get delayed and it can get messy so it should be expected.\n\nHonestly I would try to talk to your daughter alone if possible.  Her husband was incredibly rude and I can\u2019t tell if they are both entitled or he is just controlling.  You should also talk to his mother and explain your side if you haven\u2019t and maybe if she is a good mother she will smack some sense into him.", "INFO: What is missing here?

Being pregnant/hormonal doesn't mean you get to treat people as you see fit.\n\nEither way your daughter and partner went about this completely wrong at almost every turn. Having said that you could've seen a lot of this coming and with all the baby stress and all could be a bit more lenient towards them. Ow and with your comments about their filfth and all you kinda sound like you tried to make yourself irreplaceable for them and that's toxic man.", "Yta for leaving your extremely pregnant/just gave birth daughter in the lurch with a filthy unfinished bathroom.", "NTA actions have consequences", "NTA. Don't do a single thing for them again. Seriously, I never had a dad and would absolutely faint at someone offering me a new bathroom for free.  Tell him and his mom to f*ck off, and tell your daughter hey, while I understand pregnancy and childbirth is extremely stressful, you treated me like crap.", "Yes. I told her the contractor had Covid and would delay slightly.", "Also we thought we had more time to complete but they informed us of induction after the demo had been done\u2026 so we were scrambling to put it together.", "I told them that but they were anxious to get it done.", "That\u2019s a stretch. They both sound like entitled jerks, not just the husband. She\u2019s the one who told OP to do the work (for free, I might add) 1 month before her due date when he had offered 4 months earlier, and then claimed he was holding the work over heard when unforeseen circumstances arose (her early induction, contractor getting COVID). NTA OP, maybe give your daughter a break because she just had her baby in a way she wasn\u2019t probably expecting. But the husband can go chew on some sharp pointy rocks.", "What a load of crap", "No, they have one downstairs", "That\u2019s it\u2026 hence why I posted it here because I am befuddled by their response.", "I can see where you can say that\u2026 I wasn\u2019t trying to make myself irreplaceable but saying that we trashed their house when it was already a mess was kinda ludicrous to me. I was merely trying to get that point across.", "Wow, did you even read it? It was a free job, got declined for 4 months, the plumber gets covid, they still want to finish the job, it would have taken three days, and there was an offer of other accommodations during these three days.

It sounds like they decided to start this project a month before her due date but she was induced early. And it sounds like you told them starting then was a bad idea. Then the project was delayed by 3 days or so and they absolutely FLIPPED out. \n\nSo either they feel that you failed to give them crucial information like:  construction projects rarely finish on time, babies come early all the time, and a remodel is a BIG project that included plumbing and not just paint or a new shower curtain. It sounds like they feel you lied or misled them somehow and failed to live up to their expectations. So either they don't know how the world actually works and they are holding you accountable for their ignorance, or there was some major miscommunication on your part that gave them the wrong expectations. \n\nYou need someone else in your life to intervene and get more information from them.", "I get that, but felt more like a low blow. You're obviously hurt which is understandable as well.", "Contractor gets sick thursday, saturday daughter comes home with newborn to a wreck, dad calls monday to ask when they can mosey on by. \nDaughter and son in law are angry because they\u2019ve been livin in a wreck for five days with a newborn and no toilet. \nDad: how dare they be angry", "Sure.

The toilet was hooked back up, it wasn't 5 days, and they're pissed it isn't free now that they fired the person supplying labor and materials. Hell, it would be done by now had they allowed it to continue.\n\nI have no sympathy for people getting free stuff complaining it isn't good enough.", "That\u2019s not it at all.

And same goes for using access to the grandkids as a weapon.", "This is key - when things have settled down with the baby and everyone\u2019s emotions, calmly explain to your daughter that you need an apology for her behavior. Reactions can be outsized due to hormones, pregnancy, stress, etc, but that that\u2019s mitigating information, not an excuse from responsibility.", "They have a bathroom they can use.", "OP recommended holding back on the remodel until after the baby was born, but his daughter and SIL refused. Yet when unexpected things happen and the remodel takes longer than expected he's TA? How exactly does that math add up?", "If this feels like unusual behavior from them, I feel like you should cut them some slack. Usually if doctors are inducing a mother before her due date it means they are doing it for the health of the mother and/or the baby (meaning there are possible complications they are trying to avoid). That is super stressful and scary for both mother and father. Coming home to a (somewhat) unexpected construction site with a new born when you are sleep deprived, hormonal, and trying to heal (both mentally and physically) from a risky birth. They weren't paying attention to the bathroom. They are grateful for it, but at this moment they honestly don't give a shit about it because they have a tiny human they are trying to keep alive. They also probably care because mom is post birth, so she needs easy access to a bathroom and to probably minimize her time on the stairs. But now, she has to go downstairs every time she has to pee. Which is often, because pregnancy/post pregnancy means your muscles are all strained and your bladder has shrunk.\n\n\n\nAnd ok, so the timing messed up, why didn't you personally get the place cleaned up? Like if my daughter was coming home from the hospital with my newborn grandbaby, and I knew for a fact the contractors had cleaned up, I would (at a minimum) go run the vacuum again all over the house and see if there was anything I could do to help prep things for their arrival. See my first paragraph. They are already dealing with all that and they come home to construction debris... come on, you would be pissed too. And now, in order to be able to use their bathroom in a timely fashion (since 2+ weeks is a long time to have to wait for your frie d to test negative), they have to spend a bunch of money on a plumber. At the same time they are going to start getting a bunch of ridiculous hospital bills.", "The daughter and SIL have another bathroom that was completely functional.\n\nRead again, indeed . . .", "Was he supposed to send covid to their house?"]}
