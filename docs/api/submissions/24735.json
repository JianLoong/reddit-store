Unless you always ask them to the cinema of course.\n\nEven with good intentions it can be read this way:\n\n\"Hey, you're Korean, let's go see 'Train to Busan' despite the fact I've never invited you to anything ever but hey it's 'Train to Busan' which is a great tribute to Korean cinema and culture because it's Korean.  You're Korean and stuff, come join me.\"  That's probably how they're reading this.\n\nThat above sentence, doesn't even consider your interests in films or what genres you like.  I'm inviting you to watch Train to Busan but didn't for any other zombie genre films made.  Why?  Because you're Korean... at least that's what it going to look like.  Add in the fact they're probably at least in their late 40s to mid 50s and DC movies may not even be on their radar... it's going to be a stand out moot.\n\nSo flip that onto how many super hero films (or even just films in general) have you invited them to?  Only the Mexican one.\n\nYour intentions were good but it's an othering thing.", "YTA, gently.\n\nYou were trying to reach out and show interest, I get that. But as someone outside that culture, telling them how much of a great tribute to Latino culture that movie must be is kind of weird. It would have been way better if you had just said \"I like superhero movies, I like Emily, I figured maybe we could all get to know one another a little.\"", "While well intentioned inviting them to a movie based on their culture sounds like you're only looking through at them through the eyes of being \"Mexican\".  There is more to them than their culture and they don't need you to guide them to things that are about their culture. YTA", "My opinion as a Mexican Immigrant to the states is that you had the correct intentions but the way you said it was easy to misinterpret. I personally have no intrest in the way they made this movie, Im quite tired of seeing my cultures traumas and experiences sold to Hollywood so they can make millions on cute little coco guitars. NAH, they are sensitive and you should have only brought it up to your gf and she could have asked her family.", "Soft YTA\n\nThe problem is: The reason you asked them to the movie was because they're Mexican. There's nothing about each individual person's personality that made you think they'd like this movie.\n\nImagine if her parents bought you tickets to a random K-Pop concert \"Because you're Korean.\"\n\nApologize profusely for being tone-deaf. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt could be worse- at least you didn't say,\n\n\"Hey, wanna watch a movie where your people aren't portrayed as gang-bangers, gardeners or housekeepers?\"", "what if someone assumed you should want to see Joy Ride because it\u2019s a tribute to Asian-American culture? would you say, \u201comg i love chick flicks!\u201d? or would you feel that someone assumed because it\u2019s a mostly Asian-American cast that you wouldn\u2019t care about it being a chick flick (if you weren\u2019t into them)? idunno, you\u2019re NTA but it is presumptuous. doesn\u2019t matter if a movie reps your culture if you don\u2019t actually like those kinda movies. a lot of people are tired of super hero movies. it\u2019s like assuming all puerto ricans love west side story, when a lot of people hate musicals", "Soft YTA.  They're individuals, not representatives of a culture.  Do you like K-Pop?  If not, how would you react to someone inviting you to a concert because it's a love letter to your culture?", "YTA.\n\nthat\u2019s like me inviting you to a k pop concert simply because your Korean and you MUST looooove k pop.\n\ni don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal necessarily but i imagine it\u2019s annoying as fuck to be asked shit like that constantly. lucky i don\u2019t have to deal with it as much anymore so i have more patience for it.", "YTA.\n\nYes you meant well. Yes I\u2019m sure there\u2019s probably a culture barrier in how both you and her family grew up in why you would ask them to see the movie in the way you did you both need to consider. \n\nAt the end of the day it comes off as insensitive. If instead you asked because it\u2019s a movie and it\u2019ll be fun to see, then my response would be different.", "The answer hinges on one thing: has your girlfriend\u2019s family ever indicated that they have any interest in superhero films?\n\nBecause if not, yeah, even if you meant well, YTA.\n\nBasically, if they have no interest in the superhero genre, you\u2019ve implied that Mexican heritage alone is enough to interest them in a movie, which is a bit silly.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a racist. Just a little bit presumptuous.\n\nEdit: if it had been more like \u201chey this seems like a movie you\u2019d all enjoy, and the bonus is it features good representation of Mexican culture\u201d that would have been different.", "Your intentions were well-meant, it sounds like. It doesn't like you had ill-intent or anything. You simply said something ignorant unintentionally and it offended them (which I can understand).

Just use this as a learning experience for going forward.", ">I explained that it could be a great tribute watch for their culture and a love letter\n\nThere's your problem.
