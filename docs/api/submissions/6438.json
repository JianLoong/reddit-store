Your dad only found out when he wanted to do a DNA test and in turn caused your dad to no longer want to be with your mom for she had a baby with another man that he thought was his. Your mom wanted to fix things and you thought your parents were going to get back together but instead your dad found someone else and is now happily married and has a newborn baby with his loving wife that you want nothing to do with since you feel she caused the end to the possibility of your mom and dad getting back together. You say your dads wife is nice and even got you and your brother tickets to a show you both really wanted to go to & the seats are amazing but you don\u2019t want to go because it\u2019s from her and you want nothing to do with her. Your step mother is trying her best to build a positive relationship with you both because she cares about you and loves your father enough to want to build a relationship with you and Kyle. She could\u2019ve been an evil wicked step mother instead but she isn\u2019t. Also, your dad is not obligated to have your consent in marrying his current wife because he is an adult who can do what he pleases/makes him happy. He doesn\u2019t have to wait until you both finish college because what\u2019s the point in that? Did you hope your parents will still get back together during that time? Honestly your mom was probably only waiting because she was probably hoping for the same thing but that ended up not being the case. This hatred you have towards your dads wife will only cause harm to your relationship with her, but to the relationship you have with your father, your half brother Kyle, and your new half sibling. I think seeing a therapist may help you open up to this pent up hatred you have towards this woman and may allow you to open up to the possibility of having a civil relationship with her and your half sibling and save whatever relationship is left with your father. Your mother and father are both adults and their separation was for them to deal with, not yours.
