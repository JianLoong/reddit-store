You are under no obligation to pretend it isn't happening or that it isn't uncomfortable for you.\n\nDid you call it masturbation when you told them you aren't comfortable witnessing the behavior? If not, I wonder if part of the problem is their, and your, unwillingness to articulate exactly WHY the behavior is inappropriate.

So we regularly invite her son over to play at our house and she usually comes and visits at that time.  \n\nHer son also seems to prefer coming to our house, but I go out of my way to make my house a bigger lure than anything they would have going on at her home.  I do not talk to her about the messy house because I know she knows it's messy already.  She talks to me about how hard it is to organize the space.  I have helped her clean and organize twice over 8 years of friendship and would happily do it again, but I know discussing the mess is pointless.  So yeah...

OP's self quotes did come off as though she was scolding a puppy, but we don't have enough information to know what Enid's communication limit is. \n\nTo the question at hand, NTA. Your friend is subjecting you to  a person who makes you uncomfortable and blowing you off when you expressed it made you uncomfortable.

Enid is masturbating in front of people.", "No, she just didn\u2019t add the rest off he details because she\u2019s already so embarrassed and feeling awkward. \n\nI\u2019m definitely sure it involved exactly what you\u2019re thinking (AND likely a lot more details\u2026like sounds)\n\nI can feel the heat off her face from here", "No, you're just a disgusting creep", "It says it in the reading comprehension classes you obviously didn't take in school.", "If Enid is ever out alone, this could lead to a situation she can\u2019t handle.", "My son has been \u201ctickling his P\u201d since about 5ish? He\u2019s 7 now. \n\nWe set that boundary. I\u2019m a firm believer that you can do whatever you want with it behind your bedroom door but leave it alone otherwise. \n\nHe\u2019ll often yell \u201cmom I\u2019m gonna go tickle in my room!\u201d And I say \u201cok I\u2019ll yell for lunchtime.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s it. No shame. And no inappropriate behavior elsewhere. He also has learned a lifelong lesson in boundaries, the value of privacy, and that sexual stuff is an intimate thing that we don\u2019t do out in the open", "Yeah why do they think we call them private parts?", "Yes, I think all little kids do that at one point or other. Like you, I told my kids it's not bad but it is rude to do that in front of other people so they need to wait to be in their room alone. Problem solved. Our pediatrician asked about it at one point since it is a normal part of development and that was the right way to handle it.", "You can't control their home rules but you can decide to never visit again.", "Right? If you want the answers to match the problem, you have to come out and say what the actual problem is! I was reading this thinking \"what, she's not sitting in a 'ladylike' position? So what?\" But obviously that's not *at all* the situation.", "And I get that, but if you want accurate answers / advice / what have you, you need to explain the real issue", "I am not talking about masturbating in public... I am talking about Enid's freedom from repercussions. As you stated, if she were not disabled, she would be in jail.", "You\u2019re right, reading comprehension is not a real class.", "But in the case, and only if you think you want to still be friends, I would give her one chance.", "Yes this is true too. Plus she may have been treading carefully not knowing the audience. If she appeared to be making it lurid or giving the uncomfortable details, they might\u2019ve made her out to be \u201csexualizing a woman with disabilities, how dare you!\u201d \u201cOnly perverts would see what you\u2019re seeing! Clearly you shouldn\u2019t be around her anyway with those thoughts!\u201d (I quoted replies I\u2019ve heard or read here or there if this situation becomes topic. )", "This is creepy. You're creepy.", "https://www.udemy.com/topic/reading-comprehension/\n\nhttps://www.universalclass.com/i/course/reading-comprehension-101.htm\n\nhttps://www.skillshare.com/en/browse/reading-comprehension\n\n\n\nMaybe you should sign up. :)", "Right, it can be frustrating, but if you can't say the actual problem, you just won't get the right answers. It's a catch 22. Plus, there are moderators to work with as well"]}
