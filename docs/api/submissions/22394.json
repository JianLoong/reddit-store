You are not the authority to punish them.\n\nAnd they should keep the Enid under control.\n\nYou can say: \"I feel uncomfortable while Enid satisfies herself, that's why I prefer stay away from her\" but not \"That will teach you\"", "I am a sibling of a disabled man\u2026and so I can sympathize with the sisters who didn\u2019t sign up for this\u2026but they should be working on this issue.  (Or someone should). \n\nI mean, if Enid was a male and jerking off in public\u2026.well, it\u2019s just all inappropriate and a pretty big deal.  \n\nAnd you\u2026. You have a right to feel uncomfortable\u2026if she\u2019s disabled or not.  But the blocking was somewhat over the top.\n\nSo\u2026my judgement is ESH.", "I understand why you would feel uncomfortable, I think most would feel the same way in this situation.  However, Ruthie is \u201cvery, developmentally disabled\u201d.  There\u2019s a good chance that both sisters have tried to intervene but again Enid is disabled and it\u2019s not as simple as you think. \n\nThis is where you are the asshole\u2026ruthie feels you\u2019re meddling after you try to educate Enid and you in turn say this is my last visit and block Ruthie.  What type of friend does that?  You don\u2019t know Ruthie and Gemma\u2019s struggles with Enid or how difficult it is to try to teach her socially acceptable behavior.  You are not the authority by any means.  If I were Ruthie I\u2019d cut ties with you, especially after you blocked me.  She doesn\u2019t need added drama. YTA.", "YTA, I do see where you are coming from. I have a disabled brother, that being said there are only so many things you can do. I think that if you\u2019re uncomfortable yes, you should voice it. However, because Ruthie is still trying to be your friend, and you value her friendship, perhaps you need to meet and set boundaries moving forward.", "You blocked her? YTA. You make no sense and expect your behavior to be effective in changing their behavior? Good luck", "YTA\n\nFor your arrogance and lack of tact.\n\nThere's no problem with you being uncomfortable with Enid's behavior. Just don't go to their house or be out with them in public. Basically, cut all contact. That's your right.\n\nEnid's behavior in HER home is nobody's business as long as she's healthy and not harming herself or anyone else. You know her limitations, so why are you focused on this particular behavior, especially after you've made it known you're not comfortable with it?\n\nI can see how her behavior could be embarrassing in public. But again, you are not her caretaker and don't have to be seen with her.\n\nYou telling your \"friend\" you're teaching her a lesson is ridiculous. Who the hell do you think you are? Like you're doing her a service by being her friend. Given her circumstances, Ruthie probably doesn't have a lot of friends. You're the worst kind of friend. If I was Ruthie, I'd block and be done with you.", "Does it bother you Enid has an excuse to live her best life? What is holding you back from living yours?", "ESH\n\n\u201cThis will teach you\u201d makes your ultimatum about punishing your friend rather than setting your own boundary. And that\u2019s gross.", "You\u2019re the only one who gave the answer I was expecting. \nI feel that Enid fiddling with her lady bits or the area under her skirt/dress shouldn\u2019t be done in front of Ruthie\u2019s and Gemma\u2019s guests and certainly not on a public subway. Like she\u2019s very lucky nobody actually took action against her.", "Even though they have the same intent they are drastically different visuals.", "I agree with YTA for her blocking her friend and trying to educate her and her sister. NTA for no longer going to her friend\u2019s house or anywhere where she will have to interact with Ruthie.", ">Enid's behavior in HER home is nobody's business\n\nSo if you were invited to someone's home and they started dry riding their couch cushions in front of you, you'd be totally chill with it?", "Enid is straight up masturbating in front of people that dont want to see that. Even in public. While enid might not be the asshole since she has development issues, throwing shade on OP for being uncumfortable with it is wrong lol", "Yeah, I noticed many missed the point. That behavior is not okay. They need to understand the seriousness of this. I work with small children that often fiddle (although they don\u2019t have disabilities) I remind them often that it\u2019s not appropriate. You did good setting you boundaries. It\u2019s not right for you to have to power through discomfort. Someone \u201cliving their best life\u201d, should not infringe on your comfort and I think removing yourself from that situation was for the best.", "I'd leave. I would let my friend know I was uncomfortable. I would NOT presume to think I'm teaching my friend a lesson about controlling her disabled sister.\n\nOP could have suggested the other sister or a hired caregiver watch Enid for a few hours so Ruthie could get a break. If Ruthie was amenable to that, she might be grateful and enjoy having a bit of time to herself or with OP.", "We have to accept certain things as an adult and understand the challenges certain people face. I know what Enid is doing, but to a kid, she is being weird. Now if I have to explain to that same kid why they were popping out private parts, that's a whole other post. OP is resentful of Enid's freedom in my opinion.", "The cherry on top was Gemma helping Ruthie evade my boundary. I got a mini heart attack. It can feel eerie to think you're rid of someone and the next thing you know...\n\nDid the sisters expect me to just be like \"OK, ya got me!\""]}
