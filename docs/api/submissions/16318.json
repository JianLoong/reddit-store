When this happened with me and my bf and his roomates, me being at his place more, I split like utilities or whatever because I was there often enough, and I paid a few hundred towards rent, nothing near what theirs was but helped out being an unofficial kind of roommate at the time.  It still allowed me to still make out and them too.  I still saved for our own place.  They paid less in everything because even though my portion was smaller, they were happy I was contributing. \n\nYou love this girl.  Don't sit back and watch her struggle.

At very least pay her utilities since you're shitting in her toilet using her water and toilet paper, turning on her lights, using her gas to cook your food, using her electricity to charge your phone, using her water to shower, and wasting her air by breathing. You probably would expect her renter's insurance to cover your shit too. Pay for that also.\n\nAlso, make sure she doesn't get evicted because she is subletting her apartment to someone not on the lease.

Pay for everything else when you are together", "NTA\n\nI'm aparrently going to be in the minority here.  You don't officially live there.  If you get in a fight, she can kick you out.  If you break up, it's her place and you're gone.  If you don't like the furniture layout, too bad.  You also didn't choose to live in a place with that amount of rent.  Utilities are included in rent (not free as you say) so they don't increase in cost with your usage.\n\nHowever, you could contribute more to food.  The groceries you do bring are bought by your mom.  I'm guessing it's not even enough to cover what you eat throughout the month.  If you're there as much, or more than she is, buy all the food.  You're eating most of it and it would take some strain off her finances.  \n\nI do wonder why you don't just officially move in though?", "NTA She never even asked you to contribute.\n\nI understand the YTA votes but I have a different perspective. At the beginning of my current relationship I wanted to see my partner all the time, it was like a honeymoon phase. At the same time, I was definitely not ready to live with him; I liked having my own place, and even though he was there almost all the time, I definitely didn\u2019t want him to contribute to rent. Because if something was to go wrong, or if I needed space, I could have immediately ask to stay alone.\n\nLots of people say that you shouldn\u2019t stay with her that often if you don\u2019t contribute, but did they consider whether is what she wants? Not only she struggle financially but now she also won\u2019t get to see her bf as often as she would like. \n\nHaving said that, if I had means to help, and my partner was struggling, I would definitely offer to help.", "NTA. This is between you and her, your friends opinions are irrelevant. I do suggest talking with her about it just to make sure she doesn\u2019t feel used. Offer the idea of you saving up for when her lease is up to get a place together?", "I'm gonna go with NTA but would recommend pitching in. If she got the place without expecting help, it's on her to pay the bills. She shouldn't have gotten an apartment she couldn't afford. (Though housing is definitely RIDICULOUS and maybe it's the best she could do.) \n\nI was in your girlfriend's position many years ago. Divorced my ex and was slowly going into credit card debt bc I couldn't afford the place we had on my pay and I couldn't afford to move. My now husband started living with me but I never asked him for help either. He would pay everything when we'd go out together and that was it. I didn't feel like it was his responsibility to take care of bills that I put on myself. Once we got married, his paycheck started paying bills too.\n\nSo again, NTA but she's your gf who you live with most of the time. Help the woman you love with more than just food from your parent's house.", "NTA, even if in my gut you sort of are. Paying toward rent can have legal implications and provide certain rights, depending on the state. I think you should probably help out in other ways if you're not paying your own rent at home - like getting meals the majority of the time or doing near all of the driving.", "NTA. Unless you\u2019re on the lease you have no reason to pay. It could be a nice thing to do I guess, but also an easy way to get yourself into a position where you\u2019re being taken advantage of.

She won\u2019t want to move in with you at this rate babes, fix it now. Utilities, groceries, rent, renters insurance are all things she\u2019s been paying while you have been for lack of a better word mooching indeed. I don\u2019t mean to sound rude I just have been in the same situation as the girlfriend(however my ex didn\u2019t work and refused to work to contribute) whereas you work and still don\u2019t\u2026 Do better! \u2764\ufe0f", "YTA\n\nYou're basically living there and barely contributing  anything to her household when you go over. She is struggling and has told you as such and you're doing what exactly? Sitting there with your thumb up your ass? Your friend is right", "Except, you DO live there more than half the time. YTA, mooch.", "YTA, you should offer to contribute to her utilities and food at the very least, especially as she\u2019s financially struggling. You\u2019re contributing to those higher costs (water, gas, electricity, etc.). You say she has free utilities, but they\u2019re just bundled in with rent. You should agree with her on an approximate number and give her that. \n\nAlternatively, help out around the apartment. You say you work half the hours she does and she\u2019s exhausted. Go grocery shopping for her, clean up the apartment, laundry, do the cooking sometimes. If you\u2019re really not going to contribute financially, then try to contribute by making an effort in other ways.", "YTA\n\n>She says all the time how she wishes she could work less.\n\nThis is her way of indirectly asking you to help out more. If you helped out more with food, internet, etc.... She could work less and then you could spend more time together. Seems to me that if that happened she'd finally realize what a loser she's with and dump your ass. Grow up dude and stop being such a mooch.", "Hard YTA, honestly.\n\nHe's definitely increasing her utilities, and he's basically living there at this point. And she's working extra hours to scrape by, while he lives it up in two places he contributes nothing to financially? He's there 5 days a week and tries to get away with offering nothing in return by some BS technicality. And he SOMETIMES brings his own food, what about the other times?! Plus the lack of empathy in regards to how much she's struggling, partially because of him at that, right now is just infuriating.\n\nOP is a greedy, self-absorbed, inconsiderate asshole. I hope his girlfriend dumps him before he starts leaving all his belongings there and refuses to pay rent because he has all his mail sent to his parents.", "Yea, and OP are you then eating her food etc. all the other times?? It\u2019s way much if you use her utilities and space for free at this point. \n\nShe\u2019s probably being polite about it and will tire of you using her soon. Step up and offer, see what she says would be fair. She may sound reluctant at first, make sure you keep to your offer.\n\nYTA", "I left a guy for this exact reason.   \nI was doing 90% of the cleaning, all of the shopping, managing the bills (making sure they got paid on time, even the full cost out of my own account).  \nMy exact words were \"If I'm doing all this on my own, I may as well be on my own\".", "But we aren\u2019t ready to move in yet", "My parents are always in my business and her utilities are free", "No just the groceries. My mom offers", "She has free utilities", "Ok bur she never says no and the days I\u2019m off during the week she says I can stay over while she works. Why am I an asshole I help with dishes and stuff", "Also sad she's saying she's struggling and he's like here are a couple apples from my parents.", "That food shouldn\u2019t even count as a contribution. He took it from his parents house. Guy is closer to 30 than 20. Eventually, she\u2019s going to dump his loser ass.", "Oh lord look at his post history. Definitely mooch", "then he needs to spend the majority of his time in his own home", "or since she's expressed that she feels it's unfair that he's over so often without contributing, maybe he should be at his own home??\n\nhe wants all the benefits of having moved out without the cost.", "Yup at some point we'll hear from her talking about how her bf stays there 5 times a week and never contributes and Reddit will tell her to end things.", "You already have. More than 50% means you live there.\n\nWhether you are on the lease or it was ever even discussed doesn\u2019t matter. It is the amount of time spent. Period.\n\nThis is a standard IRS definition and used by any census agency. Also recognized that way in the courts.\n\nThe only reason you don\u2019t want to recognize it - because you are a mooch.", "YOU ALREADY MOVED IN WITHOUT HER PERMISSION", "Who says you should move in together? You take most of your dumps there. You use the toilet paper, you use water to flush and shower. You eat her food, charge your phone, drink her coffee and use her soap. The list goes on.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you should just \u201cget over it\u201d and move in together but you\u2019re not a casual, once in a blue moon guest either, are you? The least you could do is go shopping for groceries, toiletries, detergents and so on few times a month.", "You already have.", "Then go home", "Cause you\u2019re cheap.", "No you\u2019re not ready to have actual expenses and need 2 mommy\u2019s. You\u2019re ready to move in more than half the time but still have your other rent free home. Not cool and not fair.", "Oh goodness they\u2019re always in your business, but you enjoy living there with zero expenses right? You\u2019re mooching everywhere you go buddy, grow up.", "Jfc, no such thing as \u201cfree utilities\u201d. Unless she\u2019s stealing them from neighbors, she is paying for it in her rent.", "No, no they're not.  They may be included, but they not free.", "So, you refuse to stay there less than half the week? Then give her some rent money. You\u2019re taking advantage of your overworked girlfriend/babysitter.", "Your mom buys the groceries you bring over?", "Not the guy you're replying to and I actually think NTA but she does NOT have free utilities. The cost of utilities is added to her rent.\n\nNo landlord is losing money every month to pay their tenants water bill. It's part of her rent. Not free.\n\nSorry just had to clear that up.", "Add the utilities are included in rent to your post", "If utilities are included with her rent, I\u2019d recommend: 1.buy her groceries. once a week go to the grocery store, buy the food, take it to her place and put it away. Or place a weekly online order to be delivered and put it away\n2.Cook her dinner once or twice a week, have it ready when she\u2019s home from work. Cool enough that she has leftovers for a lunch or two. You will buy all the ingredients necessary in this scenario, and will clean up afterwards \n3. Pay for her internet and TV. Switch it to your name or set up a monthly etransfer to her account", "And a free tool.", "How old are you? If you are a late teen this attitude is mildly ok, since you don\u2019t know much about living alone, otherwise take the judgement, people are telling you (and friends too) that you are taking advantage of your gf, you are ok living there more than half the time.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to contribute make a point of taking her out and taking her to your place even if it\u2019s not convenient", "Well, I hope she grows a backbone soon and starts telling you no.  A lot.", "No, it doesn\u2019t mean that. His stuff is in his parents\u2019 place, and in case of a break up he can leave immediately. \n\nLiving with someone is a far greater commitment, especially if you have a lease signed together. They might simply not be ready for that.", ">Also recognized that way in the courts.\n\nThat's a lofty statement. Are you a lawyer? What's the precedence? Your statement effectively implies a scenario where if she were to miss rent (for example), he would be affected, which I find hard to believe. \n\nBy accepting payment, depending on the state, there could be an issue of legal status. As it stands, he is still a guest. \n\nu/Ordinary-Cookie-9779, do not take the above user's comments as legally correct.", "No I didn\u2019t she says yes when I come over", "Haahaha.. snort.... even the mom knows he is a freeloader and feels bad for the girlfriend", "Ordinary-deadbeat-6969\n\nEdit: YTA", "I was thinking the same things. \n\n\nOP, YTA. Get your head out of your own behind and pay your share of what you're using. You are already living with her in all but name.", "If they break up and she wants to kick him out, he\u2019s been there long enough to force it to be an eviction scenario.\n\nI don\u2019t make the rules - but in most jurisdictions in the US, that\u2019s the law. More than 50% over a span of 30 days is recognized as legal residence.\n\nEdit: actually a lot of states are even lower on their standards and state 14 days in a six month period.", "Bro, how old are you???? You sound like you\u2019re 12.", "But this means that she would pay the same for utilities regardless of whether he\u2019s there or not (as they are included in rent, and not dependant on usage)", "I don't think that applies to apartments or rentals.", "a different post says 27", "He\u2019s still using that stuff that she\u2019s paying for. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019ll cost the same amount.", "It does.", "Yikes. I was assuming he was 18 or 19. 27 is way too old be be acting and thinking that way."]}
