You're already living with her might as well start paying bills and change your address. YTA if i was your girl is leave you in the dust. She sounds more like another mother to you than a partner or girlfriend lmao. If you want a real working relationship you need to put in more work in at least financially.

When this happened with me and my bf and his roomates, me being at his place more, I split like utilities or whatever because I was there often enough, and I paid a few hundred towards rent, nothing near what theirs was but helped out being an unofficial kind of roommate at the time.  It still allowed me to still make out and them too.  I still saved for our own place.  They paid less in everything because even though my portion was smaller, they were happy I was contributing. \n\nYou love this girl.  Don't sit back and watch her struggle.  She's a hard worker, and it feels like you're taking advantage of her.  Either pay up something on the regular for your time there, or don't stay there anymore.

At very least pay her utilities since you're shitting in her toilet using her water and toilet paper, turning on her lights, using her gas to cook your food, using her electricity to charge your phone, using her water to shower, and wasting her air by breathing. You probably would expect her renter's insurance to cover your shit too. Pay for that also.\n\nAlso, make sure she doesn't get evicted because she is subletting her apartment to someone not on the lease.

You acknowledge she's struggling financially, and despite the fact that you spend the majority of your time at her house, you're not willing to contribute anything other than occasionally bringing food? You're not paying rent to your parents. The least you can do is help your girlfriend get by instead of leaching off of her", "What does bringing food over \"sometimes\" mean cause if it's 2 out of 4 days when you come then fine...if it's once or twice a month you could definitely contribute more. You are basically living there and going home to your parents on the weekend...I get living at home and saving money but that only works if you are at home 90% of the time.", "YTA\n\nYou are spending 4 - 5 days/nights a week there, so you are making her utilities go up.  \n\nYou need to help her pay the bills for those utilities, and for food costs if you are eating there.", "YTA, if you spend more of your free time at your gf's place than your own,  then you basically already moved there.

When my now husband and I were dating he chipped in for groceries and a little extra at my place because we ate almost all our meals there. And at the time he owned his own home so he had his own bills as well.

And then, when you\u2019re ready to move in together, she\u2019ll be all the more excited about it.  \n\nRight now, seems like YTA but you can turn that ship around *really* fast.

I've had a bf like this, and in the 2 years we were together he build some beautiful collections of niche stuff, while staying at my house for free most of the week. \nHe got bored, bought a game console including all kinds of extra's, and told me he needed a month at his mommy and daddy.

I assume you use her shower, water, electricity, trash, etc, so helping her out would be a very kind and generous thing to do.

If your partner is struggling and you\u2019re going to cohabit though, supporting her would be a nice gesture.", "NTA, you are within your rights to spend the money how you want, however it would definitely be a nice thing if you can afford to chip in and help her out. Especially if she has not asked for anything, she sounds like a real sweetheart and could probably do with a little extra support in that regard. \n\nI do think people saying YTA are a bit harsh with the limited information we are given, however I would say that if I were in your situation I think I would definitely pitch in some money and help her out. Make of that what you will\n\nTl;dr NTA, but I think you should help her with it anyway.", "NTA from experience for one very specific reason - you didn't choose this place together, therefore she will always treat it as HER place even if you pay half the rent on it. Get a place together so it's both of yours, then your contribution will be worth it because it's something you have a stake in.", "NTA but you could give her a little something for the food and utilities you use.", "[deleted]", "NAH-  but \n\nif you\u2019re not ready to move in together, then why do you live there? \n\nEither you should pay some(maybe a third since you aren\u2019t on the lease) , or you should set boundaries of staying over 1-2 nights per week which by your own admission is where you\u2019re at in the relationship. The way you\u2019re doing it is codependent.", "If the situation were reversed I doubt very seriously someone would expect a woman to chip in. \n\nThat said the there are other things you can help with. Pay for everything else when you are together", "NTA\n\nI'm aparrently going to be in the minority here.  You don't officially live there.  If you get in a fight, she can kick you out.  If you break up, it's her place and you're gone.  If you don't like the furniture layout, too bad.  You also didn't choose to live in a place with that amount of rent.  Utilities are included in rent (not free as you say) so they don't increase in cost with your usage.\n\nHowever, you could contribute more to food.  The groceries you do bring are bought by your mom.  I'm guessing it's not even enough to cover what you eat throughout the month.  If you're there as much, or more than she is, buy all the food.  You're eating most of it and it would take some strain off her finances.  \n\nI do wonder why you don't just officially move in though?", "NTA She never even asked you to contribute.\n\nI understand the YTA votes but I have a different perspective. At the beginning of my current relationship I wanted to see my partner all the time, it was like a honeymoon phase. At the same time, I was definitely not ready to live with him; I liked having my own place, and even though he was there almost all the time, I definitely didn\u2019t want him to contribute to rent. Because if something was to go wrong, or if I needed space, I could have immediately ask to stay alone.\n\nLots of people say that you shouldn\u2019t stay with her that often if you don\u2019t contribute, but did they consider whether is what she wants? Not only she struggle financially but now she also won\u2019t get to see her bf as often as she would like. \n\nHaving said that, if I had means to help, and my partner was struggling, I would definitely offer to help.", "NTA. This is between you and her, your friends opinions are irrelevant. I do suggest talking with her about it just to make sure she doesn\u2019t feel used. Offer the idea of you saving up for when her lease is up to get a place together?", "I'm gonna go with NTA but would recommend pitching in. If she got the place without expecting help, it's on her to pay the bills. She shouldn't have gotten an apartment she couldn't afford. (Though housing is definitely RIDICULOUS and maybe it's the best she could do.) \n\nI was in your girlfriend's position many years ago. Divorced my ex and was slowly going into credit card debt bc I couldn't afford the place we had on my pay and I couldn't afford to move. My now husband started living with me but I never asked him for help either. He would pay everything when we'd go out together and that was it. I didn't feel like it was his responsibility to take care of bills that I put on myself. Once we got married, his paycheck started paying bills too.\n\nSo again, NTA but she's your gf who you live with most of the time. Help the woman you love with more than just food from your parent's house.", "NTA, even if in my gut you sort of are. Paying toward rent can have legal implications and provide certain rights, depending on the state. I think you should probably help out in other ways if you're not paying your own rent at home - like getting meals the majority of the time or doing near all of the driving.", "NTA. Unless you\u2019re on the lease you have no reason to pay. It could be a nice thing to do I guess, but also an easy way to get yourself into a position where you\u2019re being taken advantage of.
