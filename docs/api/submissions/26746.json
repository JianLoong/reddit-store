As someone who has has weight loss surgery, I am more aware of how much people eat because I no longer can eat that much. However, I do remember how much I used to be able to eat. \n\nYour friend should not comment on your eating habits (unless she is truly worried for you) and can\u2019t get mad that what you said was true. People who have the surgery do it so they can\u2019t eat a lot anymore. It is what it is.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA! I'm baffled as to why she's upset about you stating facts!!! I guess unless you said it in a malicious way (which it doesn't sound like you did) then I see no problem. Honestly, it could be flipped, her questioning or pointing out how much YOU eat could be considered offensive!!! Leave her to her feelings, she's just miffed that she can't eat a whole slice of pie anymore!", "She commented on your eating habits first. You responded at least partially truthfully. Seems fair", "NTA. You were just making an observation. She was the one who was out of line for remarking on how much you eat. That's pretty rude.", "ETA neither of you should have been commenting on each others\u2019 eating habits, weight, appearance, etc.", "NTA. She was the AH when she commented \"yOu eAt A lOt.\"", "NTA\n\nSo what? Your friend got weight loss surgery and now thinks it's okay for them to comment on what other folks eat? No, I don't think so.", "I\u2019d say NTA.  First of all, you may have not meant it in a snarky way, but even if you did, she started it with unnecessary comments about your eating habits.", "NTA, if she\u2019s going to talk about your eating habits, fair game to talk about the reason behind Hera.", "i mean it sounds like she was trying to shame you and didn\u2019t appreciate the reality check. nta. facts is facts, and if anyone was rude it was her imho\u2026", "NTA. \ud83d\ude02", "You were not rude per se, but I also don\u2019t think she was being rude either. Maybe that\u2019s why she got her feelings hurt? Sometimes when people don\u2019t have a filter they make observations out loud and it can backfire. I would just have a convo with her and find out where she was coming from with her remark. Sounds like a misunderstanding imo.", "NAH - \" You eat whatever you WANT to\"", "NTA. You didn't call her out in front of anyone you said it only to her. She made an observation and stated her opinion. You made an observation and stated a FACT. In my opinion she said it in a way of \"oh goodness you can eat so much but I'm a dainty lady who watches what she eats and would never eat that much\" she definitely seems to have made it in a holier than thou way. \n\nI grew up extremely overweight and always thought it rude to comment how much someone can eat.", "NTA. How is it okay for her to comment on your eating habits but you can\u2019t comment on hers?\n\nDid you ask her that? Because that screams double standard to me.", "NTA she started it by commenting on your eating, you provided an honest response. Did she suddenly forget how much she used to eat before surgery? Most people don\u2019t get to a point where WL surgery is performed by eating small portions.", "NTA - I have had weight loss surgery and I eat small compared to others. I would never dream of commenting or critiquing someone else\u2019s plate. Hella rude from your friend.", "ESH, you guys should both shut up about how each other eat lol", "Not a big deal, IMO. You didn't mean anything by it. She's probably sensitive about the topic. If you apologized, then she should get over it.", "NTA - you just stated a fact", "NTA. Is your friend mentally challenged, or does she really have no self-awareness at all??", "I don\u2019t know. It all sounded passive aggressive.", "You're both kind of in the wrong here, but apologies cost nothing beyond a little ego. If you value the friendship, apologize.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have commented on your eating habits but her getting weight loss surgery doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t eat so much. I have never had any kind of surgery & can\u2019t finish a whole meal most of the time.", "Okay so I am going against the grain here it really depends on how she said it. I can eat a shit ton and people comment on it cause it is kinda amazing. So it varies from super soft yta to nta. But the yta is really super soft.", "It depends on how she said it. She could have just said it innocently. It does sound like you were a bit snarky in your response.", "ESH. She didn't have a right to make a comment about your eating habits, you didn't have a right to comment about her health. Why not simply answer something non-committal like \"yeah, that's true\"?\n\nIs this person actually a friend?", "Nta", "Nta", "NTA I\u2019m sorry ?? She commented on your food intake which was unnecessary and rude . Your reply was factual accurate and shut her down . She can be angry all she wants but she opened the door to this conversation not you.", "Nta. She commented on your eating habits first, she should not be surprised by your response", "So it is wrong of you to point out your friend's eating habits but it is okay for her to talk about yours? Nope. What's good for the goose, etc etc.\nNTA.", "She had her stomach surgically altered to reduce capacity. She's not eating less because she has willpower...it's because she has no choice unless she wants to throw up. The girl needs a reality check. \n\nYou didn't say anything wrong, you stated a fact after she made the initial comment about your eating habits. She can deal with it.", "NTA. She was clearly being passive aggressive.\n\nBecause...What was the point of her needing to say that to you? I also would have reminded her that \" oh you're right I can. You ate waay more though...ya know before you got your surgery. Isn't that why you did it?.Mmmm...whatevs. \nThis tastes soooo good!\"\nlol\n\nIf she keeps up this kind of behavior, please allow yourself to exit this friendship ASAP. You deserve better friends.\n\ud83d\ude09", "NTA. \n\nI remember someone once said, the biggest assholes about weight, are always exfatties. I always keep that in mind as an ex-fatty myself. \n\nI have a friend who has weight loss surgery and is on ozempic. She eats as much as a toddler, and spends the rest of the time in the bathroom (someone explained to me it's called dumping syndrome). So now, I'm not joking, I get one plate of food when we go out, and just let her eat from mine instead of buying two separate things. Kinda like what OP already does.", "YTA \n\nWhile what you said may be partially or completely true, it was like a cold slap in her face. \n\nLearn some tact and sensitivity.", "ESH talking about someone else's eating habits is gross as is talking about someone's medical history", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
