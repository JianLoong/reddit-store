All things considered, your son is a saint for still inviting them. I suggest you keep a close eye on them at the wedding should they try to guilt-mooch from the honeymoon fund.", "NTA 1000 times and the in-laws are toxic people who should not be in your lives - at all!!!\n\nI would talk to both kids, explain them everything, show them the messages.\n\nThen i would ask them what they want, in order for both of them to be happy on their big day.\n\nThey could have a wonderful wedding even with 10 people they are both comfortable with.

Why do you think your DIL cut them out of her life?", "NTA! It\u2019s your money, you\u2019re entitled to do with it as you see fit. If they want a small wedding, you can still pay for a small wedding. That doesn\u2019t mean their parents are simply entitled to the money you\u2019d otherwise be spending.

Even if they had a courtroom wedding you don\u2019t owe the in laws the money. There\u2019s a valid reason you never got on with them and their daughter doesn\u2019t talk to them. Don\u2019t give them a penny. If your son is anxious you could offer to pay for a coach to help, and check with him he\u2019s happy with the plans they have or do they want to change anything. I would also be inclined to tell bianca and your son as she has valid reasons to not want them there and this may help your son understand they likely won\u2019t behave appropriately and be less stressful for bianca if they are not there rather than it would mean something to them to be there.

The fact that Bianca keeps telling them no should tell you something. Give your son and Bianca their wedding.", "NTA, it's not \"your\" wedding. You are not responsible for the type of wedding or how much it will cost (although I hope you set a reasonable maximum, you don't want bad feelings about money because you didn't think it would cost so much more than $X...).\n\nYou're enabling your son and (soon to be) daughter in law to have the wedding they want. If they wanted a small event in the registry, that's probably what they'd be having. Bianca's parents have no right to tell you off for generously supporting the couple, nor do they have any right to tell you how you should be spending your money.\n\nI recommend that you tell Bianca's parents that you're not going to change or overrule the couple's wedding plans, that as far as you are concerned the money has already been spent and that while you hope they're able to sort out new accommodation, you will not now or ever be bailing them out of financial challenges and that it's inappropriate of them to demand that of you. If they continue, tell them that you're not willing to discuss it further and any continued conversation on this matter will be harassment.\n\nOnly you can tell whether it would be appropriate to raise this with your son and Bianca. If you feel that your mentioning it would make them feel obliged to scale down their plans so that they could request your money to bail out her parents, then you should also tell them how you would feel if they were to make that choice. Some people would feel proud, others would feel insulted, both make sense given different parameters. It's good to be clear where you fall on that very wide spectrum.", "NTA, sounds like bianca is the one who wants the big wedding, not you, you\u2019re just financing what the couple wants.
