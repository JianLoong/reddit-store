Who asks their kids in-laws for money.", "The fact that they were more concerned about losing out on vacation than losing their son really says it all. Unless they both have some sort of disabilities preventing them from supporting themselves, they are solely responsible for their own circumstances. Most definitely NTA. All things considered, your son is a saint for still inviting them. I suggest you keep a close eye on them at the wedding should they try to guilt-mooch from the honeymoon fund.", "NTA 1000 times and the in-laws are toxic people who should not be in your lives - at all!!!\n\nI would talk to both kids, explain them everything, show them the messages.\n\nThen i would ask them what they want, in order for both of them to be happy on their big day.\n\nThey could have a wonderful wedding even with 10 people they are both comfortable with.

Why do you think your DIL cut them out of her life?", "NTA! It\u2019s your money, you\u2019re entitled to do with it as you see fit. If they want a small wedding, you can still pay for a small wedding. That doesn\u2019t mean their parents are simply entitled to the money you\u2019d otherwise be spending.

Even if they had a courtroom wedding you don\u2019t owe the in laws the money. There\u2019s a valid reason you never got on with them and their daughter doesn\u2019t talk to them. Don\u2019t give them a penny. If your son is anxious you could offer to pay for a coach to help, and check with him he\u2019s happy with the plans they have or do they want to change anything. I would also be inclined to tell bianca and your son as she has valid reasons to not want them there and this may help your son understand they likely won\u2019t behave appropriately and be less stressful for bianca if they are not there rather than it would mean something to them to be there.

The fact that Bianca keeps telling them no should tell you something. Give your son and Bianca their wedding.", "NTA, it's not \"your\" wedding. You are not responsible for the type of wedding or how much it will cost (although I hope you set a reasonable maximum, you don't want bad feelings about money because you didn't think it would cost so much more than $X...).\n\nYou're enabling your son and (soon to be) daughter in law to have the wedding they want. If they wanted a small event in the registry, that's probably what they'd be having. Bianca's parents have no right to tell you off for generously supporting the couple, nor do they have any right to tell you how you should be spending your money.\n\nI recommend that you tell Bianca's parents that you're not going to change or overrule the couple's wedding plans, that as far as you are concerned the money has already been spent and that while you hope they're able to sort out new accommodation, you will not now or ever be bailing them out of financial challenges and that it's inappropriate of them to demand that of you. If they continue, tell them that you're not willing to discuss it further and any continued conversation on this matter will be harassment.\n\nOnly you can tell whether it would be appropriate to raise this with your son and Bianca. If you feel that your mentioning it would make them feel obliged to scale down their plans so that they could request your money to bail out her parents, then you should also tell them how you would feel if they were to make that choice. Some people would feel proud, others would feel insulted, both make sense given different parameters. It's good to be clear where you fall on that very wide spectrum.", "NTA, sounds like bianca is the one who wants the big wedding, not you, you\u2019re just financing what the couple wants.

OP\u2019s son and Bianca should have the wedding they want, small or big. It doesn\u2019t matter if they just go to the courthouse, and OP ends up not spending any money on it. This really blows my mind that her parents would even ask for that money.", "NTA- You offered to pay for the wedding, it could be a court house, backyard, or church.  Let him choose, if he does not want it, her parents are not owed anything.", "NTA. Bianca's parents don't care about your son's anxiety for sure. They just try to use it to manipulate you into not paying for a big wedding, so that you have money for them. But you shouldn't even give them money if there was no big wedding. They should earn their own money. It is really ridiculous to expect the parents of their SIL to pay their rent.\n\nAlso your son wants that big wedding to make his wife happy. He decided to go for it and is optimistic that all will go well. Just respect his decision. It doesn't sound like anyone forced him to have a big wedding. It was his own decision. \n\n>I didn\u2019t tell Bianca any of this exchange, and I blocked her parents, who keep making fake phone numbers to reach out to me. \n\nTell Bianca what is going on and your son, too. They are outright harassing you now and they deserve the truth. Likely it would also result in them not being invited to the wedding anymore and that would be for the best. Bianca is already low contact with them and wasn't particular interested in inviting them. And I bet your son wouldn't want them there anymore either if he hears what they are doing to you.", "I think you need to talk to your son and Bianca. \n\nCertainly discuss if having a large wedding is what they both want.\n\nWhether or not you share the pressure from the in - laws is up to you.\n\nFrom what you wrote, Bianca would be mortified that her parents are putting the pressure on you.  This might cause NC and the loss of being invited to the wedding that that couple want.\n\nIn no way are you obligated to pay the in-laws.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Even if they just had a small wedding doesn't mean you need to give them money.", "NTA. Do not give in to these people. They'll just come up with another scheme to try and take your money. Maybe you should come clean and tell your son and Bianca of what's happening. The whole fake numbers thing is far enough to tell them.", "NTA. Just keep blocking them. Every time. Block them again. I know it\u2019s tiresome but they will get the message eventually.", "No way, NTA! Don't let the parents play their fun little mind games on you. First of all, why would it ever, in any reality, be your responsibility to financially support Bianca's parents? Second of all, when was it ever discussed that if you didn't end up paying for the wedding for any reason, that the money was then still up for grabs? It has one purpose. Pay for the wedding. If the wedding's in the court - the money goes to courthouse fees. If the wedding's a luncheon - the money pays for the meal. If it's a destination wedding - you get the point. As far as I can tell from the post, the offer was never, I'll pay for the wedding or gift Bianca's parents on what I would have spent on the wedding.\n\nAs for the second half, Bianca's parents are definitely, definitely attempting to manipulate you. They're the not spokespeople for your son's feelings about the wedding. Your son has told you himself he's scared, but excited. If you're feeling insecure about the type of wedding your son wants, just ask him. If he has concerns, you can make changes.", "I don't understand the in-laws' thinking. I mean, they seem to think there are 2 binary choices: either pay for A) a wedding, or B) the in-laws' rent. Even if you did follow their suggestion and not pay for a large wedding... why would you be forced somehow to pay their rent? You could pay for their honeymoon, pay for a down payment on their house, buy them a truck load of lottery tickets... or not spend anything at all.\n\nStick with your original plan. NTA", "NTA. \n\nIs there a reason why two adults don't work to support themselves?", "NTA - Bianca has already gone NC with her parents. They should not be invited to the wedding and the rest of you should follow Bianca and have NC with them. They should have never been invited to the wedding since she doesn't talk to them. That was putting her in a bad place to begin with. Tell them directly to stop calling you. I've never in my life heard of soon-to-be in-laws demanding rent money from the other in-laws. It's ridiculous and should not be tolerated. They need to get jobs like the rest of the people in the World do in order to pay their bills.", "NTA. Let your son know that if he wants to scale down the wedding it's ok. If he does, take the money you save and put it aside for him and his wife later. Her parents are not your responsibility. And if they keep getting through to you, just say, \"Sorry, I'm in the middle of something. I'll call you back later.\" And never (I mean never) call them back. This is their issue, not yours. They don't belong in the conversation between you and your son about the wedding.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA!", "NTA - Probably best to not invite them to the wedding considering they can and probably will make it about them instead of the bride and groom. No contact sounds best in this scenario.

Apparently Bianca doesn\u2019t - as she\u2019s happy to just have a legal wedding , and would rather the money went to her parents. Your son doesn\u2019t want it as he has anxiety in large groups. I\u2019m deducing , therefore , that you want the large wedding. In that case YAH. I think you might be applying pressure to them to meet your expectations and desires. \n\nBut absolutely agree no way you should be giving money to Bianca\u2019s parents.", "I would say either the wedding or a downpayment on a home for your son and his bride to be, this is a gift for your son who cares what the parents are going through NTA", "NTA\n\nTell Bianca NOW so she could deal with them.  You could warn them not to contact you through their fake phone numbers after you keep blocking them to pass on to your attorney, hopefully they'll stop.

Your son and his future bride decide on the wedding themselves without anyone else's input.", "NTA. You owe nothing to Bianca's family. In this the couple should decide their future. If they tell you \"we want a small wedding at the courthouse\" then that is on them. If they go \"full gala wedding\" that is also up to the couple. You have zero responsibilities to the other side in this. They are just being guilt tripped into something because Bianca's parents sound irresponsible. \n\nStop worrying about the money at the moment, and support the couple to make sure they know that this is their life, and owe no one anything, and to possibly go no contact with them.

It is nice that you are paying for your son's wedding, and he is fortunate, but don't let others tell you that you are an AH for not catering to grown people because of their financial status.

Even if they elope don\u2019t give those leaches a penny.", "NTA I fail to see how what her parents want comes into play in anyone else's behavior except her parents. I want a new car. Should you forgo the wedding and buy me one? No. I am barely less part of your life than her parents are (or should be). Even if Bianca wanted you to fork over money to them doesn't mean you should feel obliged to at all. You value the wedding. You don't value them leeching.", "NTA. Just when I\u2019ve heard it all.

What do you think they would say if they were informed that you decided to not have a big wedding & instead gift the money to your son & Bianca, or use it to help them buy a home or just have a super long & over the top honeymoon. They are using your son's social anxiety to try to guilt & manipulate you.\n\nIf Bianca always says no to their money requests it makes no sense that she would give up a wedding (which it sounds like she wants) for her entitled parents. Do not believe a word that comes out of their mouths - sounds like they are selfish scam artists.  \n\n\nYour son is making a huge mistake, If Bianca doesn't want them there that should be it.

He can have his bride walk down the aisle and have a beautiful formal wedding without 200 people. I\u2019m a wedding florist. I see beautiful weddings with under 100 people, even under 50 all the time. If he has that much anxiety, consider limiting the guest list- not every coworker or cousin needs to be invited. Parents, siblings, grandparents and favorite friends is plenty. There is room to compromise here and if it would be more comfortable for him, it doesn\u2019t have to be either the alone at the courthouse extreme or the full blown 200 person affair. They as a couple can also choose which traditions to include (cake cutting? First dance?) and which to exclude- (garter toss? Toasts?).
