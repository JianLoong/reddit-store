How would she feel if her friends just assumed she would care for their pets and home without giving her the option to say no.  Contrary to what your wife believes, \u201cno\u201d is a complete answer. You do not have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do in this situation.

If he  says no, I will inform them.

So NTA.", "NTA. No is a full sentence. You don't feel up for it, and don't have to do it. I can't stand being signed up for stuff, and then told you're an A H for saying no.

Can I demand money from a bank if I say that it's important to me?\n\nWill they cast me in the next revival of The Music Man if i say it's important to me?\n\nJust watch--as soon as it starts, she'll begin to nag and push and sulk.

Why?  Because it was the nice thing to do and if I'm not gonna be nice to my *wife* and help her with something that isn't really that big of a deal when she asks, I'd have a problem with myself.  \n\nGo ahead and downvote this all you want, my decades of being in a happy marriage with my awesome wife means way more than what Reddit people think.", "ESH.

She's your wife and it's important to her, the pets will be ok.\n\nWhat do you think might happen on your watch that you couldn't live with yourself? That's a weird statement to make. Just feed them and have fun and help your wife.\n\nYTA btw.", "YTA.  Marriage requires loving compassion and empathy for the feelings of another person.  Oftentimes, this means that we are mindful of prioritizing the needs of someone else, especially when situations are more important to them than to ourselves.  Selfish people don't care about anyone besides themselves.  It was important to your wife to help out her friend in need, but you completely disregarded her feelings so that you can simply get your way like a child because of meaningless principles.  Congratulations on ruining your marriage and breaking your wife's heart, unless you come to your senses and apologize to your wife, somehow contact the people, and lovingly take care of that dog.", "ESH. This is such a weird hill to die on. Why is she insisting? Why are you resisting? Do either of you have a habit of making couples commitments and then coercing the other into joining?

There's nothing wrong with that imo, while communicating is healthy and you absolutely should talk this out, you should TALK it out and recognizing that you guys aren't ready to have a conversation versus a screaming match or combative argument is pretty cool. I know way too many people who can't recognize that and only make their issue bigger by going in still on full tilt.\n\nAs for the question, NTA. I also don't like the stress of watching animals that aren't mine. Your wife should have asked you, not assumed. You said no. No is a full answer.\n\nFood for thought; have you guys had a vacation together recently? A fun get away? Maybe she was thinking of this in terms of something fun for you to do together and got ahead of herself. Also could be that she doesn't want to be apart for a whole week. Maybe you can make plans to spend time together during that week even though she will be away. \n\nGood luck, I hope you two resolve this and have a good talk about why you both reacted the way you did!", "NTA, wife is voluntelling and guilt-tripping OP just to look good to her friends. Also kennels and home monitoring systems exist.", "NTA.\n\nBut neither is she. I used to do exactly what she\u2019s doing, but for a job. I loved to invite my partner or friends to hang out with me, it helped to spend some time together! Bond over a most likely unique, unfamiliar environment.\n\nMaybe you should discuss this with her, maybe it really is important to her. And maybe in her mind she was really excited about it.\n\nYou make it sound like it\u2019s a pain in the ass and a bother. And that you made it sound that way when you were \u201cexplaining your reason\u201d to her. Which is never a way to let your partner down. Probably why she reacted the way she did, and she might\u2019ve taken it personally.\n\nCommunication buddy. That\u2019s all. NTA but neither is she. Try and answer with a little more respect for your woman and her feelings.", "She should have asked you how you felt before volunteering to take the animals. It's your home too and now you have these extra animals around. It would be nice to help out, but she should bear the burden of caring for them since she volunteered.", "So you were volunteered without your consent to do a job that you don't want to do and once you refused to do it the perpetrator got angry with you. NTA for sure but surely a pushover if you ever doubted even for one moment that you weren't in the wrong with this one. Tell your wife that next time dhe wants to volunteer you for something to check with you first.", "NTA\n\nFrom my understanding, she volunteered you into this without asking you first, so easy NTA for me.\n\nIt's amazing how many times I see in here an argument stemming from someone assuming the other person would do something. Lesson is don't assume..", "ESH neither of you seem capable of communicating with one another. She's acting immature and rude but at the same time surely you could have told her you didn't want the responsibility. Not \"I don't want to\" like a sulking teenager. Now neither of you are talking to one another?", "Info how far will she go for the house sitting?", "\"Really important to her\" = wants to push some of the responsibility she has signed up for onto you so she can just play with the dogs and snoop.\n\nIt's not really important to her, it's just really embarrassing to her in her eyes she has told her food friends you suggested it/ wanted to do it yourself.\n\nYou have every right to your opinion and you did not sign up for it. NTA but you both need to get better at communicating as just not speaking to each other for ages is not terribly productive. You can agree to disagree and let her lay in the bed she made but she can't be mad at you.\n\nSometimes you have to do stuff to keep the peace or the help out when you don't really want to but she signed you up and argued with you when you gave an answer she didn't like which was always going to be a risk of", "NTA. Sounds like your wife lives in the do/feel everything box. When she\u2019s there, everything feels important and since there\u2019s so much to do (and all of it is important) everything becomes a \u201cgroup project.\u201d Took me 16 years to figure out that\u2019s where I was living! Lol my husband was going crazy because I saw his resources (his time, mental energy, physical energy) as an extension of my own! So when people asked me to do something, I automatically assumed his resources in my ability to say yes. It\u2019s crazy. I know that now. But I didn\u2019t realize that before because I only had two options in my brain: do/feel everything or instant relief (where I escaped/procrastinated) and yes I am ADHD. I am not that way anymore, and it doesn\u2019t kill me either. I had to activate other parts of my brain though! Im Actually much happier realizing I don\u2019t have to say yes to everything and I can say no to things without guilt. And I NEVER volunteer or assume my husband will do things ever without asking. He\u2019s actually 10x more willing to help me now that I respect him and his boundaries. In fact, he can\u2019t get enough of me, so if I was babysitting a dog, he would follow me just to be near me now. Lol \n\nI can bet she\u2019s not trying to be controlling or back you in a corner. I\u2019m betting she\u2019s wired like I was! Let me know if you need more information about it", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t preventing her from doing it. You just personally don\u2019t want to do it. Let her do it, then, and enjoy a little mini-vacation from each other. It\u2019s healthy for spouses to have their own pursuits and interests.", "Nopideenopenope. NTA. You're a grown man. I've seen similar AITA posts from people's older kids that were put in this position when parents went away and stuff like that. \n\nWe each need to ask every person for their consent before arranging anything for them these days. Why did she offer you up to something you don't want to do?! She should have thought about your likely reaction before planning your time. She possibly wanted to help at the time but didn't think it through enough, and for that she can calm down an apologise then you guys can work out a compromise where you might want to help her out maybe just once. But you don't have to. Don't fall out with her, there's absolutely no reason. She shouldn't get angry or anything because you say no, you hae the right to say no! Stay calm and don't be pushed into replying to anger. If she can't calm down and see this is her mistake ... Well that's not cool either. You might want to let her know, she's building a second problem if she can't show you respect for your time.", "\"Hey husband, I agreed to go take care of my friend's dog so I'm gonna need you to go over and do that.\" \n\nNTA.", "NTA because of she wanted you to participate in a week long commitment away from your home, she should've discussed ahead of time... But why do you think you'll kill a dog in a week? They're only slightly more work than a houseplant unless it's a crazy high energy or medically complex dog. Feed it, water it, and take it out on a leash from time to time. They don't die easily unless you don't have them secure when you open a door and they are a bolter that will run in traffic.", "Doing something like that for a week is a major commitment.  At the very least, she should have discussed it with you first before making any promises.  \n\nNTA\n\nAlso, you didn't say where the friend's house is located.  Is this in your town, or will your wife have to travel to get there.  If you would have to sacrifice vacation time to do this, then she's doubly wrong for not discussing with you first.", "If it's so important to your wife that you spend the time together, she should have \\*asked\\* you first.\n\nYou are NTA for being annoyed at being voluntold for something.\n\nYour wife is being overly pushy.", "NTA for the simple fact she should've asked you first if you were interested in doing it not just assume you would be on board with it then get upset when you said you were not.", "NTA, but it would be nice to help.", "NTA she volunteered you to dog/house sit without your input.\n\nNot your problem.", "Huh. It's very important to your wife to dogsit? I smell a rat, or, rather, a dog. Did you, by any chance, discussed having pets previously, or did you at any point (maybe several years ago, even) mentioned you don't want pets? Because as someone who has been denied pets for 18 years I see a person who wants to maybe get you used to idea of having pets by trialing other people pets first.\n\nSomething to ask your wife when you're speaking again. Seeing as you aren't yet mature enough to discuss things when you disagree, underhanded tactics instead of another fight about pets doesn't seem all that far-fetched here.\n\nAlso, YTA. Why did you chose this woman (or anyone, for that matter) as a life PARTNER, if you don't want the partnership aka sharing life tasks big and small?", "NTA.  \n\nIf she wanted your help, she should have talked to you before agreeing to watch the animals.  \n\nSince she didn't ask you, you are under no obligation to help her.  You take care of issues that come up while she's taking care of them, but that's it.  When I would agree to watch my neighbors three dogs, my husband never went over.  He would watch the kids or cook a meal while I was nextdoor, but I never expected him to help me.  \n\nSo tell her to enjoy her volunteer work and you'll be home when she gets back.", "NTA, does your wife have this habit of volunteering your time for other people without asking you?", "\nTrying to make you feel bad for not saying the answer she wants to hear is just shitty behaviour on her part.", "Hard agree and also This is funny. I literally committed to the exact same thing TONIGHT\n\nmy husband isn\u2019t coming. I invited him but he doesn\u2019t want to, which is perfectly fine. We are both looking forward to having some alone time in the separate houses. It\u2019s gonna be like a mini vacation for me as they live closer to the beach than I do. I am excited to explore with the dogs and enjoy their cable tv (we haven\u2019t had cable for years), Im not going to speak many words for an entire weekend and I\u2019m stoked!\n\nthey are two people they can make their own choices and do things separately sometimes.\n\nHe were not consulted before she committed major NTA.", "I believe they call that being 'voluntold' and it's not a good thing to do to anyone! Thank goodness you taught him haha.", "Considering this is planned for the fall.... I assume this was the first attempt at discussing it.", "She is literally speaking to him about it beforehand.  The trip is planned for the fall.  It's June. She can tell her friend it isn't going to work still.  She isn't contractually obliged. You only see one side to the story.  For all we know, the conversation between the wife and her friend went along the lines of, \"Let me see what my husband says\"", "Because they are her friends and are like \"her second family\". Seems plenty clear to me why she wants to help them and wants OP to help too.", "That analogy was the oranges to OP's apples. You seem to have missed the bit where OP's wife never asked him anything before volunteering his time and effort.\n\nWhere, exactly, did OP fail to communicate clearly?", "This!", "You have some issues. Wow.", "Where\u2019s the love, compassion, and empathy for OP\u2019s feelings? Why is his wife not prioritizing the needs of her husband? Why does she gets her way, but OP is a child for setting a reasonable boundary?", "Exactly, an afternoon would be one thing, but a whole week? That's something it's probably best not to agree to without discussing it with the other partner first :P", "She hasn't volunteered him. She volunteered her own time, and now she's asking him to do it with her.", "The first attempt at discussing it should come before agreeing to anything, even a text \"hey X is planning a trip and want to know if we can look after their dogs, don't need to answer now but what do you think?\"", "We only know one side to the conversation. Id bet OP is leaving sine stuff out or skewing the perspective in their favor. There is a ton of info missing from this post.", "Relationships are about compromise. Sometimes that means compromising on issues that you just don\u2019t understand.

How is it any better than volunteering his time?", "Doing the good work!!", "Compromise comes after communication, which she failed to do. But that\u2019s just my opinion.
