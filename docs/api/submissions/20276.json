How would she feel if her friends just assumed she would care for their pets and home without giving her the option to say no.  Contrary to what your wife believes, \u201cno\u201d is a complete answer. You do not have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do in this situation.

If he  says no, I will inform them. I accept that he has the right to say no, without me asking, \"well why not?\"  But it took about 10 years to pound it into his thick head, he could not volunteer  me and no is the only reason he needs.   So NTA.", "NTA. No is a full sentence. You don't feel up for it, and don't have to do it. I can't stand being signed up for stuff, and then told you're an A H for saying no.

Can I demand money from a bank if I say that it's important to me?\n\nWill they cast me in the next revival of The Music Man if i say it's important to me?\n\nJust watch--as soon as it starts, she'll begin to nag and push and sulk.

Why?  Because it was the nice thing to do and if I'm not gonna be nice to my *wife* and help her with something that isn't really that big of a deal when she asks, I'd have a problem with myself.  \n\nGo ahead and downvote this all you want, my decades of being in a happy marriage with my awesome wife means way more than what Reddit people think.", "ESH.

She's your wife and it's important to her, the pets will be ok.\n\nWhat do you think might happen on your watch that you couldn't live with yourself? That's a weird statement to make. Just feed them and have fun and help your wife.\n\nYTA btw.", "YTA.  Marriage requires loving compassion and empathy for the feelings of another person.  Oftentimes, this means that we are mindful of prioritizing the needs of someone else, especially when situations are more important to them than to ourselves.  Selfish people don't care about anyone besides themselves.  It was important to your wife to help out her friend in need, but you completely disregarded her feelings so that you can simply get your way like a child because of meaningless principles.  Congratulations on ruining your marriage and breaking your wife's heart, unless you come to your senses and apologize to your wife, somehow contact the people, and lovingly take care of that dog.", "ESH. This is such a weird hill to die on. Why is she insisting? Why are you resisting? Do either of you have a habit of making couples commitments and then coercing the other into joining?

You saw fit to tell Reddit your perspective, why couldn't you do that with your partner?", "NTA for not wanting to do this, but have you asked your wife why she would like to have you with her? Is it a nice place that could work as an inexpensive mini vacation for you? Is it a scary neighborhood and she doesn't want to be alone?

Obviously there's a reason you're so disinclined to do this, and it's obviously not some melodramatic altruism like if the pets die, so yeah just repeating \"because\" is pretty poor behavior.  \n\nThe core of healthy relationships is compromise; my SO and I do plenty of stuff we may not be over the moon about, but you do it because you love that person and their happiness mean's something to you. She wants to watch Below Deck? Fine, I hate the show with a passion but I yield time to make her happy. I want to go to a late night showing of Jaws? Same thing. There's give and take within reason. \n\nI think reason is the key. If you can't legitimately articulate your feelings as to why this is such a big ask for you, then it comes off as unfeeling. If this is a family she cares about, or likes their pets, it's easy to imagine it's meaningful to her. And even then, it's not like you can't have an adult discussion about what you're agreeing to. Like if you're that averse to picking up dogshit or whatever, why not set some groundrules that you'll go there but she has to pull the lion's share of the weight with picking up after the animals?\n\nAnd if there's some kernel here that makes it so that being in that position is genuinely a demanding thing for you \u2013 e.g. you were attacked by a dog or whatever when you were a kid and it's traumatic, you have an insane week at work, or maybe have hygiene fixation about going over other people's houses \u2013 then have a discussion about it. Personally outside of these extenuating circumstances, asking to house/petsit is not really a huge ask. Depending on how close they were, I might expect some payment, but it's fairly common for friends to ask each other to housesit. My siblings and I petsit for each other routinely for no cost, but I agreed to housesit for a coworker (didn't end up happening) a while back for compensation. \n\nThe real issue here, to me, is instantly shutting down and refusing to communicate. And for the record, I'm a person who has difficulty processing my emotions, but that's why when we disagree, I take time to think and explain myself. It's a hard and conscientious process but it's something we have to learn.", "ESH, She should have asked you first, instead of just telling you.

Maybe she wanted this to be a cute sort of getaway or maybe she lowkey wants pets and wants to do a pet ownership trial run with you to warm you up to the idea. If there really is something like that, maybe you can talk to her about other ways to experience the desired effect. She could also be interpreting your actions in a way which hasn\u2019t occurred to you, we all have different triggers. It really seems like there\u2019s more to this.", "NAH: when I house/dog sit, I think of it like a mini vacation with an Airbnb and cute puppers around. I don\u2019t really consider it much work.

I get why you wouldn\u2019t feel that way. Perhaps she\u2019s afraid she can\u2019t handle the dogs alone. Has she ever taken care of dogs before? Knowing why will help you discuss this and figure out a way to compromise. For example, dog and house sitting isn\u2019t a 24/7 activity.
