How would she feel if her friends just assumed she would care for their pets and home without giving her the option to say no.  Contrary to what your wife believes, \u201cno\u201d is a complete answer. You do not have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do in this situation.

If he  says no, I will inform them.

So NTA.", "NTA. No is a full sentence. You don't feel up for it, and don't have to do it. I can't stand being signed up for stuff, and then told you're an A H for saying no.

Can I demand money from a bank if I say that it's important to me?\n\nWill they cast me in the next revival of The Music Man if i say it's important to me?\n\nJust watch--as soon as it starts, she'll begin to nag and push and sulk.

Why?  Because it was the nice thing to do and if I'm not gonna be nice to my *wife* and help her with something that isn't really that big of a deal when she asks, I'd have a problem with myself.  \n\nGo ahead and downvote this all you want, my decades of being in a happy marriage with my awesome wife means way more than what Reddit people think.", "ESH.

She's your wife and it's important to her, the pets will be ok.\n\nWhat do you think might happen on your watch that you couldn't live with yourself? That's a weird statement to make. Just feed them and have fun and help your wife.\n\nYTA btw.", "YTA.  Marriage requires loving compassion and empathy for the feelings of another person.  Oftentimes, this means that we are mindful of prioritizing the needs of someone else, especially when situations are more important to them than to ourselves.  Selfish people don't care about anyone besides themselves.  It was important to your wife to help out her friend in need, but you completely disregarded her feelings so that you can simply get your way like a child because of meaningless principles.  Congratulations on ruining your marriage and breaking your wife's heart, unless you come to your senses and apologize to your wife, somehow contact the people, and lovingly take care of that dog.", "ESH. This is such a weird hill to die on. Why is she insisting? Why are you resisting? Do either of you have a habit of making couples commitments and then coercing the other into joining?

The language of the post doesn\u2019t read like this is a first time thing.  \n\nThe initial post came off as\u2026 fucking frustrated.  Not so much entitled?   Does that make sense?  And also?  It\u2019s OK to take a time out.  If they don\u2019t have anything nice to say to each other RIGHT NOW, it\u2019s not always so bad to mutually withdraw and respect each other from a distance until things cool off.  \n\nI, for one, am so uncomfortable and triggered by someone else offering/deciding/dictating MY PERSONAL TIME without consulting ME FUCKING FIRST, that it will send me into an absolute tailspin.   Yes, duh, lots of trauma to uncover there and I\u2019m mostly aware of those factors and why I react like I do, but HONESTLY?????   DON\u2019T COMMIT SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S TIME, WITHOUT ASKING THEM FIRST, EVER.  **THE END**", "I think the compromise in this situation would be to spend part of the week over at their place with his wife.", "I completely agree. I lose my ever loving mind when I\u2019m forced into these situations I have so much anxiety and trauma about being trapped in any way. If she wanted you to help and be a part of it, she should have asked you before agreeing on your behalf. She\u2019s welcome to do it on her own. NTA", "But let her do all the work? I personally think that she should do all the work because she volunteered. You might do things to support your partner if they are having hard times but this doesn\u2019t meet that definition", "Adding on to this, the important things OP seems to be referring to are \"Important things that can't be done without me.\" And this certainly doesn't fall under that category.\n\nTo OP\nYou guys seem to be doing well, unconventional is fine, even good as long as you both work out happy.\n\nNTA", "I think its perfectly fine to draw the line but if you wanted to compromise, you could help her out some time of some of the days. Relationships are give and take, but mutual agreement to things are important and listening to your own needs. As doing something in spite of your feelings and needs just builds resentment.", "OP I think Dragonflymon83 is probably someone who  volunteers their partners for stuff and expect them to just suck it up.  You are not TA.", "Yes, I didn't mean to take over the work. Just to spend time with her over there", "I can guarantee it would have.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, my wife does stuff she doesn't really want to do because it's something that's important to me as well.  It's a two way street.  A marriage isn't (or shouldn't be) a competition on who's wants/needs supercedes the other's.  It's never a binary choice.  I disagree with my wife at times and she disagrees with me times, but we are always on the same side regardless.  A lot (not all) of comments in this thread are incredibly self possessed and read like they are written by people who see marriage as some sort of sterile arrangement between two people who are ultimately thinking not of *us* but as *me/them* and I think that's just sad.  Being so consumed about minutiae and who's violating who's autonomy instead of focusing on working together to accomplish something, even if it's only important to one party, is just something that I do not like in any aspect.  This goes beyond marriage and encompasses all forms of human relationships.  It's such a \"me, me, me\" mindset.  Working together, helping others, and sacrificing for the well-being of others are wonderful traits that humans are capable of, and too many times people lose sight of that because they find it inconvenient."]}
