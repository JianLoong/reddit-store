She should've consulted you before hand because one week of house and dog sitting isn't exactly a small or simple commitment.", "Why can't she do it on her own? Have some alone time? Tell her have fun and to watch the shows she likes that you don't. NTA", "NTA. Compromise is the pinnacle of any healthy relationship, which means sometimes you bite the bullet and dog sit and other times, like this time, you say you just don\u2019t want to. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a no and you seem to have communicated it respectfully.", "NTA she made a decision without asking you first. Measure twice, cut once.", "NTA. Your wife agreed to do a favor for someone, assuming you would jump in and participate. However, she didn\u2019t ask you. How would she feel if her friends just assumed she would care for their pets and home without giving her the option to say no.  Contrary to what your wife believes, \u201cno\u201d is a complete answer. You do not have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do in this situation. Tell her she is welcome to fulfill her promise to her friends but you will be staying home. She needs to remember that as your partner she should at least ask if you want to participate and if you have any issues with her agreeing to offer her assistance.", "NTA-your wife should of asked you. she didn\u2019t ask you, you declined to help her because you weren\u2019t up to it and didn\u2019t know about it.", "NTA, she warned very suddenly", "***NTA***. sure, you could do it.  Especially *just* for her.   But you don't  *have* to.\n\nShe should.also respect your stance. SHE agreed to do it (without even speaking with you) and assumed you would.\n\nQuite frankly, the whole not speaking to one another is total childish BS.  You *both* need to grow up where that is concerned.\n\nIf something *this* trivial has you two not speaking, I hesitate to think what happens when you two encounter a real situation.  Good luck.", "NTA. In full agreement with you, you were volun-told and if the situations were reversed, I'm sure she'd be equally pissed at you.\n\nThat said...even if you might win the court of reddit opinion and be technically \"in the right,\" you also need to ask yourself how much this matters or how much it's worth fighting back on. Obviously if this is a pattern or has happened before, you might need to have a talk about this. But also, there's no reason to be contrary and stick to your guns for no reason beyond your own pride.\n\nYou should probably talk with your wife on how her decision made you feel left out and not respected, but also don't purposefully be antagonistic just to \"win\"", "I have been  married for over 40 years, to the same person.  It was a lot of work to convince him he can volunteer  his time, but not mine.  If someone asks if he can do something, I will ask him, and if he says yes, I give him their number.  If he  says no, I will inform them. I accept that he has the right to say no, without me asking, \"well why not?\"  But it took about 10 years to pound it into his thick head, he could not volunteer  me and no is the only reason he needs.   So NTA.", "NTA. No is a full sentence. You don't feel up for it, and don't have to do it. I can't stand being signed up for stuff, and then told you're an A H for saying no. Trying to make you feel bad for not saying the answer she wants to hear is just shitty behaviour on her part.", "NTA, she should have asked you before agreeing to it.", "NTA- it isn\u2019t your responsibility, I bet she said yes because she thought you were going to help her with it all and didn\u2019t want to do it alone. She should\u2019ve spoken to you about this before hand before accepting instead of trying to make you do it with her.", "NTA.\n\nShe volunteered you without asking because she had no intention of doing most of or any of this dog-sitting.\n\nOh, I have a headache. Oh, I have lunch with Mother. Oh, I need to garden.\n\nShe was all prepared to throw a tantrum if you even once begged off on doing a favor to people who I'm guessing don't matter to you in the first place.\n\nShe says it's important to her. What\\[s that supposed to mean? Can I demand money from a bank if I say that it's important to me?\n\nWill they cast me in the next revival of The Music Man if i say it's important to me?\n\nJust watch--as soon as it starts, she'll begin to nag and push and sulk. Because she wants to score brownie points with these friends of hers.", "NTA", "NTA. I dog sit for friends/family fairly regularly, I'd never expect somebody else to do it with me unless they specifically said they wanted to", "NTA, should never commit to something you can't do by yourself and expect help. Always ask the person you're trying to get help from. If they're willing to do it. She agreed she can do it by herself.", "I find it odd that \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d isn\u2019t a good enough reason for you not to do it, but her saying \u201cI want to, it\u2019s important to me\u201d is supposedly a good enough reason that you should. I might be biased because I hate being \u201cvolunteered\u201d for things and really hate staying at other people\u2019s houses, but to me \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d is completely valid.", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nI dont blame you for not wanting to get roped into this because your wife volunteered for this duty.  She said she would do it, so let her do it.  BUT, \n\nWhats it going to hurt to hang out with your wife?", "This is very reminiscent of a post from a few months back where the husband refused to help his wife\u2019s family member move. You\u2019re not being pigeonholed, and aren\u2019t required to help, but just because you\u2019d technically be right doesn\u2019t mean you wouldn\u2019t be an A H. \n\nI\u2019m going with ESH. Her for trying to make you, and you for choosing this hill to die on. Your excuse of \u201cI could never live with myself if something happened to them (your friends pets) on your watch\u201d is beyond a cop out and we all know it.", "I'm going with YTA.  I've had the same exact thing happen to me.  My wife agreed to watch someone else's dog and asked if I would help.  Did I want to?  Not really.  Did I agree to help her out with it?  Heck yea I did.  Why?  Because it was the nice thing to do and if I'm not gonna be nice to my *wife* and help her with something that isn't really that big of a deal when she asks, I'd have a problem with myself.  \n\nGo ahead and downvote this all you want, my decades of being in a happy marriage with my awesome wife means way more than what Reddit people think.", "ESH.    Y\u2019all are more interested in getting your own way that in respecting each other.  There is SOOOO much room to compromise but you both want to win your point. Marriage will be long and difficult at this rate", "You don't have to do everything she asked for but at least help her out a bit. She's your wife and it's important to her, the pets will be ok.\n\nWhat do you think might happen on your watch that you couldn't live with yourself? That's a weird statement to make. Just feed them and have fun and help your wife.\n\nYTA btw.", "YTA.  Marriage requires loving compassion and empathy for the feelings of another person.  Oftentimes, this means that we are mindful of prioritizing the needs of someone else, especially when situations are more important to them than to ourselves.  Selfish people don't care about anyone besides themselves.  It was important to your wife to help out her friend in need, but you completely disregarded her feelings so that you can simply get your way like a child because of meaningless principles.  Congratulations on ruining your marriage and breaking your wife's heart, unless you come to your senses and apologize to your wife, somehow contact the people, and lovingly take care of that dog.", "ESH. This is such a weird hill to die on. Why is she insisting? Why are you resisting? Do either of you have a habit of making couples commitments and then coercing the other into joining? Why can't either of you communicate and compromise over the course of a week?", "YTA   because not wanting to take responsibility for someone else's pets is a *total* copout!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a dog and a cat, and I wouldn\u2019t be happy if an individual I trusted with their care tried to get an uninterested person to \u201chelp\u201d with them. It was the wife that was trusted with their care, not the husband, and she definitely should be asking the friends if they\u2019re comfortable with another person being in their home/taking care of their dogs too.

I've definitely done stuff that I didn't want to for her before (and vice versa) but that's when it's important (for example, driving her brother 2 hours to go pick up the new car he bought).

I've been there too, and yeah, it can be annoying.  But your wife is more important here and so is your happiness together.
