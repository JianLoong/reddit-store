Had my cat Jinx for about two years. Jinx broke into my house during the hardest time of my life, and instantly saved me from deep depression. I love him to death, he is my best friend.\n\nLilly recently got divorced and is in the process of moving out of her ex\u2019s house. I don\u2019t know the details but I know it was messy. She asked me if she could stay in my spare room (my home office, Jinx thinks of it as his own room). I told her so and that there isn\u2019t space for all of her stuff, but still offered to let her stay for a bit since I have an air mattress. She was grateful for that but then she also asked if I could keep my cat elsewhere while she was there. \n\nApparently she is very allergic to cats. I don\u2019t have another place for Jinx to stay, for free (pet hotels here go $50 a day and they put them in extremely small cages), and even if Jinx wasn\u2019t there his hair would still be everywhere. I told her so and said she should probably ask other friends who doesn\u2019t have cats. She got extremely mad and said she can\u2019t believe I\u2019m prioritizing a cat over her, and that she needs to rethink our friendship before hanging up. I get that shes in a rough spot, I can\u2019t imagine what she is currently going through. I feel awful. But I don\u2019t want to send Jinx away for however long it would be to accommodate her. AITA?\n\nedit: Lilly suggested I put him in a kennel out on my balcony (not an option, its freezing cold out), or send him to a friends house (I have friends who petsit for a living, not something I feel I should ask for free though) or pet hotel. She didn\u2019t clarify how long she\u2019ll be staying. Jinx also hates closed doors and knows how to open them so keeping him in one room would be tricky. I am also 20% cat hair, Jinx sleeps on my face. \n\nI appreciate all the comments, thank you all for supporting my decision. Lilly has been a good friend for a long time, has supported me in the past and is generally very chill, but I think the divorce is really affecting her. I\u2019m going to give her some space for now, and give Jinx extra butt rubs.\n\n[cat tax](https://imgur.io/a/yQqNFF8)", "created_utc": 1672932267, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1041m7q/aita_for_choosing_my_cat_over_a_longtime_friend/", "score": 889, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The bonus is that they are also cat-exclusive to minimise the stress of dogs etc. being present, all of the enclosures are designed for cats specifically with no bars or cages. They even provide enrichment and guarantee interaction and playtime as well as plenty of cuddles and pats. You get what you pay for though, it's pricey and not all areas will have access to pet hotels with so many thoughtful features.\n\nIn the case of OP, they don't have time to do the research and prep that would be needed to make sure that their kitty has the best possible quality of care, and it'd be unfair to put that pressure on them. **NTA IMO, springing those demands last minute as a guest (when someone is doing them a favour, no less!) is beyond the pale.**", "do it!", "Oh no, Catpocalypse"]}
