Had my cat Jinx for about two years. Jinx broke into my house during the hardest time of my life, and instantly saved me from deep depression. I love him to death, he is my best friend.\n\nLilly recently got divorced and is in the process of moving out of her ex\u2019s house. I don\u2019t know the details but I know it was messy. She asked me if she could stay in my spare room (my home office, Jinx thinks of it as his own room). I told her so and that there isn\u2019t space for all of her stuff, but still offered to let her stay for a bit since I have an air mattress. She was grateful for that but then she also asked if I could keep my cat elsewhere while she was there. \n\nApparently she is very allergic to cats. I don\u2019t have another place for Jinx to stay, for free (pet hotels here go $50 a day and they put them in extremely small cages), and even if Jinx wasn\u2019t there his hair would still be everywhere. I told her so and said she should probably ask other friends who doesn\u2019t have cats. She got extremely mad and said she can\u2019t believe I\u2019m prioritizing a cat over her, and that she needs to rethink our friendship before hanging up. I get that shes in a rough spot, I can\u2019t imagine what she is currently going through. I feel awful. But I don\u2019t want to send Jinx away for however long it would be to accommodate her.

Cat hair and dander is very hard to remove from things like rugs and upholstered furniture - even cracks in the floor boards or heating ducts. \n\nYou are not prioritizing your cat over your friend, you are just not able to accommodate her needs. \n\nThat being said - give her some time to cool off and approach the situation with some grace if she reaches back out.

She knew that you have a cat when she ask and just assumed that you give your cat away for who knows how long. I really can't understand the thought process.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't \"owe\" her a place to stay, to begin with.  If she would end your friendship if you refused to take her in, for WHATEVER reason you had, then she's not much of a friend.\n\nYou didn't do that, you offered her what you could reasonably do, which was an air mattress in your dander-filled apartment.  Sorry but that's a take it or leave it offer.\n\nJust because she is getting a divorce does not mean she gets to dictate how you run your life. If you had a relative who could take Jinx, maybe it would be OK to ask, but not DEMAND.\n\nAt the end of the day I think it's a good thing she's allergic to cats.  Otherwise she'd have moved you out of your office and been re-arranging your kitchen cupboards by now.  \n\nJinx saves your life AGAIN.", "NTA. You made an effort to take your friend in. Unless she's willing to pay for the cat to be put up in a kennel, you can't magic your cat into non-existence. There are other ways to support her, besides giving her a place to live, and I'm sure you haven't closed those off to her.", "NTA.\n\nIf she's allergic to cats why would she have even asked? Cat dander doesn't just magically disappear when the cat isn't in the space, even if you clean thoroughly and often.\n\nIf she's that good of a friend why would she have even asked you to \"keep your cat elsewhere\" knowing what the cat means to you?

Stupid of her to even ask knowing that you have a cat.", "NTA. I'd tell her that she doesn't need to rethink anything. Your friendship is pretty much over at this point.", "Nta.

She knows about the cat so if she wants to stay there it's part of the deal.", " NTA - I really respect you for seeing it from her perspective, trying to even imagine what she\u2019s going through. \n\nBut for her to ask that of you when you\u2019ve offered a place for her to stay? r/choosingbeggars is you need to send her.", "NTA and Jinx relies on you and needs you.

Your friend would be a guest and can\u2019t just kick your cat out for her own convenience, this is such an entitle thing to do! And also it would hurt the cat psychologically too since you can\u2019t explain to Jinx you\u2019ll be back and he would feel so abandoned. Plus it would cost you money, even if she\u2019d ask to cover the cost this isn\u2019t fair. \nThe list of the reasons why she\u2019s the AH could continue. \nBottom line she can\u2019t make rules in your house and if she wants things in a certain way she can choose an hotel or Airbnb.\nCat mamas forever \u2764\ufe0f", "Really, she is the one throwing a friendship away over a cat, not you..let her", "NTA. Good for you for protecting your cat. I wouldn't put mine out of their home to house an entitled \"friend\" either.", "NTA. What a choosy beggar your friend is. She's not entitled to stay at your place, nor to have you get rid of your cat. Poor kitty!\n\n>pet hotels here go $50 a day\n\n$50 per day is roughly $1,500 per month. Unless you live somewhere with very expensive housing, it would cost less to rent a small apartment for Lilly to stay in. Not that I think you should do that.\n\n>and they put them in extremely small cages\n\nDon't send Jinx there.

She's a longtime friend but she didn't help you with depression, whereas Jinx did. Lilly demands that you get rid of Jinx, but Jinx has never asked you to get rid of Lilly.\n\nHas Lilly tried taking anti-allergy tablets to deal with her cat allergy?\n\n>But I don\u2019t want to send Jinx away for however long it would be to accommodate her.\n\nJust how long would Lilly want to stay, anyway? A week, a month, a year?", "NTA. It's your catim your home. You are doing her a favor by letting her stay. She can not expect you to dump your cat to accommodate her.

You are choosing your day-to-day life, which includes your beloved cat, over disruption that will make you unhappy. Your entitled friend is ridiculous for expecting you to rehome a pet just for her. She can take allergy pills or find another place to live. What nerve!", "NTA - she asked to move into YOUR space and wants you to get rid of the cat!  Your suggestion for her to find a non-cat home was spot-on.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your cat lives there and was there first. She isn't being even a little bit reasonable in her request.", "NTA; as others have said, how would removing poor Jinx even help the situation?  Your entire house is House of Cat, even after a normal level of household cleaning.  You can't put her up because you live in House of Cat.", "NTA\n\nThere is literally nothing you can do about having cat hair and dander all over your house. Your home (and vents!) would have to be professionally cleaned for this to be safe and comfortable for her. For someone 'very' allergic to cats, I'm really surprised that she doesn't already know this.", "NTA. I have a dear friend who is dangerously allergic to dander. In this scenario, she would do what you suggested and exhaust all other possible options before asking me even though we're very close. If she had absolutely no other choices, she would figure something out to make it work without expecting me to send any animals away. I don't know what the solution would be, I just know my oldest and bestest friends would never ask that much *because* they are my oldest and bestest friends.", "NTA - She is a entiled friend , glad you protect your cat \nYou should end things with her", "NTA. Of course, you're prioritizing Jinx over her; he's your best friend and family member. It's his home as much as yours.\n\nLook, I get it. Helping her would be a nice thing to do, but you're not really in the best position to be able to do that. Her blaming you for that is selfish and entitled. Maybe it's a good thing she's taking space, so you can also re-evaluate a friendship with someone that would ask you to dump your literal lifeline.", "NTA.

Our pets are also our family. She\u2019s basically demanding that you remove a family member from your home.

You were willing to accommodate her to your place and help her (when you didn\u2019t have to) she has no right to tell you how/what to do with your pets.
