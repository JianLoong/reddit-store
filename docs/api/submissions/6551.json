Lilly should not ask you to move your cat out of your (and his) own home; that's clearly unacceptable\u2014but I don't see anyone else questioning that the spare room is off-limits partially because your cat thinks of it as his own room?\n\nSeveral months ago, a \"friend of a friend\" whom we had never met before was in a really unstable housing situation and we offered them our spare room. This person has two cats and we have an absolutely beloved dog that doesn't like cats, but my husband and I talked about it and even though it would be stressful for everyone involved, the human being in need made us willing to try, still.\n\nLilly's been your friend for over a decade and is facing a major life upheaval. It was not nice or right for her to ask you to move your pet, but you guys should have had a real conversation that included the words \"Jinx will be staying here, that's non-negotiable\" and then discussed how long she might stay and if you could temporarily give up your home office/if she could manage in the home office as a cat-free zone for that time until she could find long-term housing, rather than this.", "NTA - Toss Lily some Benadryl and tell her to go kick rocks.\n\nEdit: forgot judgement!", "Completely agree! We have friends that have 4 cats. I am allergic and an asthmatic. Any time we go over to their house, they thoroughly clean one chair for me to help with it but everywhere else is cat friendly. I would never in a million years ask them to put their cats away or send them away for me. I come with my benadryl and inhaler and just know going in the cats are there. When I get home I change and wash up. Our friends are nice enough to clean a chair for me but totally do not need to. I know what I am getting myself into. OP is NTA and her friend needs a reality check.", "Cats and kennels don't mix. Not a good idea.", "Pets are family. I\u2019d never kick them out. I know she\u2019s in a rough spot but honestly there\u2019s no way you can really get all that cat hair out. NTA\n\nAlso, cat tax", "she said until she is able to find her own place, but didn\u2019t give me an exact timeframe which made me feel uneasy", "[my bad, here is him looking apologetic](https://imgur.com/a/0Ql7qkL)", "[him dressed as an eggplant!](https://imgur.com/a/yQqNFF8)", "And that doesn't take dander in account, as someone with serious allergies to cats I know how hard it is to get rid of all the dander, just cleaning is not going to do it.", "That would make me feel uneasy too. It can be difficult to get rid of someone after they've moved in if they don't want to leave. Why would she look for her own place if she could continue staying at yours rent-free?", "My cat had to spend the day at the vet getting his blood sugar tested for his diabetes. He won\u2019t let us do it at home, and he\u2019s realllly mad right now. \ud83d\ude39\n\nMy other cat is mild mannered UNLESS he sees another cat out the window (or is on the way to the vet), then he sounds like an air raid siren.", "Me as well.", "The cat actually lives there so yeah he does have priority.", "Yeah that\u2019s AH for sure", "[removed]", ">Yeah that\u2019s AH for sure\n\nYes, I agree that the friend is TA for asking OP to get rid of her cat.", "No that\u2019s not the issue the friend is allergic to the cat and wants OP to get rid of the cat while she is there. If the friend wanted to stay there with the cat that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t displace the cat.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
