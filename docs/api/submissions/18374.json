Both my parent figues got incredibly sick at once. My grandma who raise me had a severe stroke that left her bedridden, my bipolar, disabled mum fell into a paranoid psychosis which left homeless and in and out of psych wards. The rest of my family are  narcissistic people who just care about money who want both my grandma and my mum dead. \nI got married to my wife two years ago when we both were oblivious to the shit that was about to happen. My wife also suffers from trauma due to neglect and is heavily triggerd by this whole situation.  \n\nYesterday  and than today we got into a big fight and I don't know if im being an asshole here: My mum had a bad psychotic episode again and I had to call an ambulance and admit her to the clinic because she was being sucidal and making fires in her house. This all happened this week two days before my wifes birthday. I know that her mum always forgot her birthday and she was already crying when i got home from the clinic because she was scared that i would neglect her because of my mum. \n\nI tried my best to get my shit together and still come to the party, went shopping with her, prepared food etc. but on the day of the  i had to bring my mum shoes because she left them at home when she was admitted. I told her that i would try my best to be back a little early so i can finish preparing with her. But i got stuck at the hospital and missed my  bus and could only be there on time for the birthday to start not to finish the preparations. My wife got really angry because I promised to help her and then didn't keep my promise. She says that she always has to put her needs back and feel like she can't be upset now because i always have it worse. she said that she  feels like my mum won't get better anyway so i have to stop using her as an excuse for my poor time management and breaking promises. I apologized for being late but told her that its really hard for me right now and that im trying my best already. she said she wants me to try harder and communicate more clearly next time that i cant be there for her and that she even offered not having her birthday because of my mum but I said I was fine and I could help her. Her birthday was great btw.

I think individual and couples counseling is in order for you both to heal from your past experiences.  \n\nI\u2019d recommend you speak with the folks in the hospital about additional services for your mom.  You will not be able to do all this on your own\u2026and your mother\u2019s condition will worsen over time.  You are still newly married with only two years in.  You and your wife deserve to enjoy life together.  Wishing you and your wife happiness and joy togetherness.", "Info- why we're you stuck at the hospital? You're vague about the reason why you missed your wife's birthday when your original mission was to drop your mother's shoes off at the hospital, something that shouldn't take an unreasonable amount of time.\n\nEdit: the prep, not the whole party.", "NAH. If your wife is having a breakdown over you missing the set up/beginning of a party she may need therapy. I understand she has trauma from childhood but I assume she wasn\u2019t entirely alone whereas your mother is having an episode and is probably not handling well. \n\nThat being said, she\u2019s not the asshole either. You were clouded by stress with your mum and broke a promise. Did you not call her to let her know? Her argument was valid. \n\nI feel as though you and your wife need to sit down and have a serious conversation about everything \u2014 she feels like you\u2019re constantly putting her second and she can\u2019t voice her feelings because she\u2019d sound like a raging asshole, it\u2019s possible due to the stress you\u2019ve probably in someway compared your traumas so she feels like she can\u2019t be honest. \n\nMy mother has paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and after a severe episode where she was committed to hospital they got her on some pretty good meds and it\u2019s made the world of difference, hopefully that can happen for you. \n\nYour comment about feeling like shit about leaving your mum alone and having the staff deal with her is valid but the health workers are trained to handle people with severe episodes so you shouldn\u2019t feel bad. She\u2019s in the best place at the moment.

You're beloved grandmother and her stroke, your mom's suicidal thoughts, wife's past trauma involving her birthday. I mean how much is one person supposed to take? It's time to sit down with your wife and really share with her how you're feeling as well. You both need support.", "INFO: \n\nWhy was it urgent, two days after admission, for your mum to have the shoes that day? She's managed two days without them, so would one more day have been an issue??\n\nWhat caused you to get stuck at the hospital and miss your bus? Was the delay at the hospital due to your mother, your own poor time-keeping, or the medics needing to speak to you about your mother's condition?\n\nWhat is the basis of the communication complaint?", "NAH. Caretaking is very hard and draining. Both on the person being the caretaker and their loved ones. However, people in hospital and their needs trump birthday party preparations.

This is a beautiful quality to have- but it can also be very hard to manage. \n\nYou have to move your mom and grandma into facilities that can help them. This is the only answer.", "NAH. You being late sounds like it triggered your wife's trauma but really, what else could you do?

You\u2019re mom is in the hospital ffs.  Maybe there are other times you put your mom first when you shouldn\u2019t have, but in this situation, your wife is being totally unreasonable.", "Do like the airlines do-If you plan 2x the amount of time for everything, you\u2019ll never disappoint. If you expected the hospital to take 1 hour, plan on 2.

It seems like,  just from what she said,  you put her needs last.  It really really sucks that your family is going through what it is.  But your wife is family too. Did your mom NEED those shoes right then? Or could she have waited? You need to prioritize. Helping your extended family in these times is absolutely okay but not at the expense of your wife's feelings or needs. That's not okay.\n\nThat being said, your wife does need to realize you cannot heal her trauma. Things happen. You didn't mean to miss the bus, you didn't mean to be late.  I hope she's in therapy. I hope she learns to overcome her triggers because everyone deserves a peaceful life and it seems that she hasn't had one.", "NAH, maybe gentle YTA... It seems your wife just needs more communication. She is trying to be supportive but it seems like she doesn't know what to do and keeps guessing (such as offering to cancel her birthday) as you seem to be keeping her out a bit. Whilst this may be self-preservation to you, it's painful to her.\n\nIt's hard, but just keep at it.", "This is far beyond the scope of this sub. I will say your wife thinks you\u2019re an asshole and perception is also reality. I hope you are in therapy", "NTA. Your mum being acutely unwell is more important than a birthday. A grown adult crying because you didn\u2019t devote the entire few days up to and including her actual birthday to celebrating her birthday has issues. There\u2019s absolutely no need for her to behave this way.

Factually you do have it worse right now. Your wife being triggered doesn't mean you are responsible for her emotions or you are required to soothe her. Having someone in your life as a priority doesn't mean you drop everything for them no matter the urgency. Is your partner able to support you too? When your mother is having a psychotic episode in which she's suicidal and setting fires, this is obviously a life or death situation that trumps a party no matter what the back story is. Having to drop shoes off is lower down the list, but still something necessary to do. Realistically, you might not have capacity to care for your partner as well as your mother. It really means finding out if your partner willing to be with you knowing that you may have to break promises (which should be made from here on in with the understanding that an emergency involving your mum will trump an event). Who looks after you?

It seems your wife was trying to accommodate you and \n\nBut to answer your question   YTA for breaking your promise and now communicating.  You could of talked with her.    NTA for been there for you mum", "Gentle YTA. You had two days before the party to get your mother her shoes and whatever else she might need. Even if she got transferred. Did she only need shoes after those two days? You already know that your mother has a chronical illness, your wife is kind of right, it won't get better with her. You also knew how important it was for your wife to have you with her. Yet you decided to deal with the shoe problem last minute. You really need to get your priorities straight, your wife definitely needs therapy for her traumas as well. It's a big mess you have there. I wish you the best", "[removed]", "YTA. You didn't have to go to your mum right there and then. You chose to. She's in a safe place with people looking after her needs and you chose to prioritise her over your wife. Again. On her birthday. When she has trigger points about neglectful behaviours. \n\nTake a look at yourself because no matter how you twist this, you made the decision.", "NTA I get why your wife is disappointed but I also have family members who struggle with mental health and sometimes you have to make other sacrifices to be there for them.  You had to feel very conflicted.  I do suggest counseling for you and your wife to help you deal with the guilt, grief and stress and establish some boundaries so you can keep your promises to your wife too.  The emphasis on birthdays can be triggering.  Ask her how you can make things right.  I will be holding a positive thought for you.", "NTA.\n\nBased on your post history I think the best idea is for you and your wife to separate and for you to get therapy because she's toxic based on previous posts and gonna continue to drag you down.", "NTA!! I don't know if this is American culture but I'm dumbstruck reading people's comment agreeing with OP's wife about not catering to the mother because she'll probably remain sick. If you expect parents to cater to their children irrespective of disabilities, flaws, etc., how do you not feel guilty about abandoning them when you can absolutely support them? Wife needs therapy, and while I agree that it's an unfortunate situation for everyone involved but I'd still say OP was right about prioritizing their suicidal mother over wife's birthday party.

For them; ESH.)\nCrappy situation.", "NTA. I'm sorry she's upset because you missed the last part of getting ready for her birthday? But you did help her get ready in the days leading up and were there for the actual party? I have to assume this is a straw that broke the camel's back scenario because that's just not you neglecting her needs, that's her being overly demanding. \n\nI'd suggest marriage counseling and individual therapy for both of you.", "NTA.

You need to hear it.  You ARE putting your wife last. You are married. She is your priority. Your mom needs professionals, not you.

She could have waited one more day for her shoes. And you could have left the hospital on time. I get that you're spread thin right now, but it sounds like you're making your mother your 100% priority and your wife zero. This does not bode well for your marriage.

If this was an isolated incident I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole, but I\u2019m betting it\u2019s pretty frequent and this was just the final straw for your wife. Her saying your mom isn\u2019t going to get better is probably her picturing the next decade of her life with you constantly prioritizing your mom\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d (she didn\u2019t actually NEED her shoes that day) over her feelings. I\u2019d say YTA if this is a constant occurrence.

You cannot set yourself on fire to try to keep  her warm. \n\nYou both need to communicate more, you made a promise and knw you were going to be breaking it by staying with your mother. A quick text to update your wife could have been sent. She can't use you as her coping method, she has to learn to manage her own symptoms. It is truly heartbreaking to know she suffered neglect and abuse as a child, and so her brain always looks for that sort of thing to happen, but you both need to work out ways she can comfort herself and use facts to fight these feelings.\n\nYou're going through a rough time with caretaking, which has its own set of burnout and exhaustion. You need support too. \n\nHope you two find the best ways forward for yourselves as individuals first, and as a couple second.\n\nNAH two struggling people, just trying their best to survive, don't need judgment, but love and support.

As someone with bipolar who has had to stay in mental hospitals before, shoes aren\u2019t necessarily needed and you could\u2019ve taken them to her earlier if you wanted to. I can see both sides here. \n\nAlso minor correction (question?) but previously you\u2019ve stated you and your wife have been together 4 years, and now you\u2019re saying it\u2019s 2.

Your wife has trauma but she could also try to understand what's happening with you. NTA", "NAH. There\u2019s a few commenters saying you should\u2019ve put your wife first due to her past. It seems to me you\u2019re damned if you do and if you don\u2019t. I think you did the right thing bringing shoes to your mother, considering you didn\u2019t miss the party at all (just the prep) I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty negligible. If it were me, and my mum was suicidal and clearly unwell/unstable and god forbid anything happened to her, not doing a simple task one time would constantly hang over my head for a long time (but that\u2019s my personal view). \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that your wife has had a traumatic past surrounding birthdays etc. but she should also understand that your mother is an important part of your life and needs that extra time/support. It also sounds like you\u2019re going through an awful lot and could do with some help yourself so don\u2019t beat yourself up too much. \n\nLike I said, damned if you do and don\u2019t.

Planning a birthday party isn\u2019t a need it\u2019s a want.", "This is a really tough one. I don't know.", "Here's the thing, your mother was being cared for by qualified people so you're statement about needing to calm her down isn't necessarily correct. You feel guilty for her being in the facility to begin with and are trying to compensate. On the surface that isn't necessarily bad thing, but when you add your wife's own past trauma of abandonment and neglect then you have a mess partially of your own making. Did the staff ask you to stay to help calm her as they were unable to? Did she seem fine until she realized you were leaving and not taking her with you? How many times has there been an incident with your mother and you dropped everything, and everyone, to rush to her side? Yes, she has a mental illness but that does not mean you sacrifice everything in your life to cater to it. She has a team of professionals, not everyone has that, so you should not be taking on every issue every single moment.\n\nIt's not a question of did she need her shoes, it's a question of did she need her shoes right at that moment. Chances are, if you look back, you'll answer no, she didn't need them right then and could have waited until after the party. You're wife has issues as well, and a big one is not being a priority in anyone's life,  which you cemented with breaking a promise to her. Is it a crappy situation? Yes, it is. Are you handling it the best way you can? Well, maybe. Have you sought help in dealing with your own trauma? Or how about finding strategies to deal with the complexities of family with mental illnesses? Learned about prioritizing and boundaries? If your answer to those questions are no, then you have some things to take care of for yourself, if you want to continue to be supportive of others.\n\nHonestly, I'm on the fence as far as judgements go. It's not your mother's fault for having a mental illness. But it is her fault if she stops treatment. It's not your wife's fault for expecting her husband to keep a promise (because it wasn't about the birthday). But it is her fault for not finding help to deal with her abandoment issues. It's not your fault that you have so much on your plate. But it is your fault if you don't find ways to manage things better.\n\nIt's a crap situation that entails many intricate needs. Right now you need to take a moment to step back and figure what to do next. Suggestion: find a therapist who specializes in childhood trauma and family dynamics of mental illnesses. Also, keep in mind the majority of those with bipolar disorder (as well as other mental illnesses) are great manipulators. Ask specifically for ways to spot any manipulation, and how to deal with it when it occurs. It won't be easy, but this will help you in the long run.\n\nDisclosure: I've interacted with family members who suffer from different mental illness my whole life.
