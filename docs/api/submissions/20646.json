I don\u2019t mind bringing 2 more dogs into the family, but they\u2019re tiny chihuahuas. I have an 85 lb Rhodesian Ridgeback. He\u2019s huge, a little stinky, and has major separation  anxiety. He\u2019s 10 months old and still a puppy. The Chihuahuas are elder dogs. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ended up leaving his sisters house and finding a job at a hotel that lets him stay in a hotel suite. He thinks both of us and the 3 dogs can live comfortably in this hotel room because they\u2019re only charging him 400$ a month and he\u2019s going to be there for a while.  Where I am at now, my dog has a backyard he can run around, my family who watches him when I have to work 3rd, and a nice area for him to go into his cage and be alone to de stress. I take him on multiple walks a day and treat him as if he were an extension of me. I love my dog. I love my fianc\u00e9, but I think it\u2019s unfair to ask that I take myself and my dog out of my house and downsize to a hotel room. \nHe said I valued my dog over him.

I have no clue as to what is going on with the estate. All I know is that his siblings are all trying to lay claim to it. His parents had a will, I should have corrected that, they didn\u2019t have an updated will, it\u2019s being contested.

Moving across the country to live in a hotel room with 3 dogs? Absolutely not. Your fiance has lost the plot.", "It sounds like some details are missing. What was the reason why your fiance got a job while he was out with his sister on the West Coast? That seems to be kind of a big, permanent, life changing deal. *(edited to add: Did you have any idea he had plans to do that? Did he talk it over with you first?)* It seems like maybe he didn't intend to come back to the East Coast if he's seeking out employment opportunities on the West Coast.", "Info - why did he decide to just up and get a job and place to live out there? Did he have a job where you two were living? Why is his parents estate so complicated?", "NTA. This goes far beyond your dog. You'd be leaving your friends, your family, your JOB to live across the country for an indefinite amount of time. Then what? You'll want a job and not sit around a hotel room all day. How easy will it be to find one? What happens when the estate is settled. Do you stay there or go back east? Will your job still be there or do you have to start over again? Yes, we all make sacrifices and compromises for our significant others but this is make or break time. You may be engaged but what do you want for your life.\n\nThis isn't just about your dog and you need to have a serious conversation.", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to understand big dogs need space to run. Also, yours is a puppy, so it doesn't understand that small, older dogs don't want to play.\n\nI would not find living in a hotel room with multiple dogs optimal. It sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.", "NTA. People do what they have to do to survive. However, forcing a LARGE puppy and two tiny elderly dogs to live in one room would not be fair to anyone.", "INFO - is this west coast move permanent, or just until the will is sorted? Did he discuss this with you before taking a job out there?", " NTA! Giving up a place with a backyard for a hotelroom is nuts.", "NTA Could you make this situation work with space? Of course. In a hotel room? You have senior small dogs. You have a large breed puppy( probably not used to senior, small breed dogs) This isn\u2019t a good situation at all. \nThe chihuahuas were taken from their home. They are in a strange place. They lost their caretaker. Your dog wouldn\u2019t have the space to e work out and would be introduced to a completely new environment. Dogs are adaptable, sure, but this is going to make for some serious stressful situations.", "NTA. The move was meant to be temporary, according to your story. It sounds like he wants to live on the W.C., and he wants you to give up everything to join him. If it IS temporary, it\u2019s completely unreasonable for you to quit your job, go there, then have to do it again when you return. That doesn\u2019t sound like what\u2019s happening, though. You need to have the conversation about what he wants: stay on WC or come back to EC.", "INFO\u2014 a key piece of info missing is how long this hotel arrangement is supposed to last. How long is he going to be in the hotel/west coast, in total?\n\nThis sounds like an extremely unusual situation. He is out there to settle an estate but he got a job out there?! That lets him live in a hotel room??", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Your bf is probably just stressed and not thinking clearly.", "Nta. He unilaterally decided that you would uproot your life to move across the country. Why? What benefits are there for you? Are there job opportunities there that would improve your life? Has he made a habit of forcing your hand with his actions? \n\nDog aside? How do you see yourself with this person in the future?", "NTA", "NTA. Too much uncertainty. Stay home.", "Nta, moving a dog into a small apartment when it lived in a house with big yard and space to actually be happy isn\u2019t best nor good to do.", "The dogs are beside the point.   Uprooting your entire life because he decided to settle thousands of miles away, without consulting you is unreasonable.   You are allowed to take time to think and decide if this is something you want to do, if long distance is worth considering, or if someone who makes major unilateral decisions and then tries to guilt you into compliance is perhaps not an ideal life partner.", "NTA\n\nYeah, you're only 24, moving across the country with some guy to live in a hotel would be a completely stupid move, even if he is your fiance.\n\nWant some advice you didn't ask for? Don't get married until you are in your 30s, late 20s at the very least. You'll regret it otherwise. I guarantee that within 2-5 years you're going to be a completely different person than you are now", "NTA. Stay put with your dog. Do not move across the country to live in a hotel room with your fianc\u00e9 and 3 dogs. These kind of legal fights can be ugly and take a long time to resolve. You don\u2019t want to rearrange your entire life for this with the idea that it will just be temporary, it could literally take years. There\u2019s no way 5 mammals, including a large puppy, can live in 1 hotel room. Just no. It\u2019s not you choosing your dog over him. He\u2019s asking you to move across the country on a half baked plan. You can support him from a distance, until you you guys come up with a plan that takes everyone\u2019s needs into account.", "He's potentially also seeing a bigger picture, but not communicating it to her. Sounds like his parents might've been pretty well off if they're buying apartment buildings and siblings are fighting over the \"estate.\" When my dad died, the word estate was never used because he was beyond broke. lol\n\nI think this could be a test since they're not married yet...he wants to see if she values him more than a dog. He's not even asking her to get rid of it, he's asking her to \"suffer\" for a short time in a hotel suite to potentially benefit long term.\n\nWe definitely need more context, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA - OP, NTA generally since it sounds like he hasn't communicated much to you, unless you're leaving a lot out. You ATA for not responding to him when he said that, though. His parents both died (sounds like same time or soon after?), he's fighting with siblings...sure, he shouldn't say that, but you shouldn't be ghosting your supposed fiance at a time like that...reassure the guy, he needs your support.", "[deleted]", "A will contest could take a year to get sorted.", "Honestly, I'd think a person choosing their dog over someone squabbling with their siblings over their dead parents' money is the far safer bet than someone who'd abandon their dog to come live in a hotel with me on the potential for hitting the inheritance jackpot, but that's just me.", "OP says there is a will but it is being contested.\n(No will would be simpler because the law of intestate succession would determine everything; here there is apparently stuff to fight about).\nSounds like a mess that OP should nope out of.", "I\u2019m not gonna judge but train your dog for separation anxiety", "Someone made a comment about how his family sounds really well off (buying apartment buildings) and the estate may be much bigger than he originally let on. Most people don't have huge fights over inheritance if its not something significant. He may not be telling you yet because he wants to make sure that any decision you make is for him and not for money or something. He should probably already know that as you guys are engaged but I guess he needs more reassurance. Also you are putting the dog first, but I'm not commenting on whether I think that's a good or bad things.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t remotely understand why the dog is the sticking point when the ask is completely unhinged. This man really wants you to come be HOMELESS with him and the only thing you\u2019re fighting about is the dog??\n\nHe wants you to \n\n1)sell your house/break your lease \n\n2)put all your stuff in storage \n\n3)move cross-country \n\n4)into a hotel room \n\n5)with multiple animals \n\n6) for an indeterminate amount of time\n\n7) to\u2026 keep him company? I guess?\n\n8) when you\u2019re unmarried and have zero rights to any property or wealth he has.\n\n\nThis is how horror movies start. Completely isolated, no means of support, you don\u2019t even have a single item you own! For what purpose?! What happens when he\u2019s done with the estate? What happens if he gets nothing? What happens if this takes years?!\n\nNo, do not leave everything and everyone you know for zero guarantees or even EXPLANATIONS. The hell??", "NTA\n\nNever ever ever move for a man.", "Nta, your fiance is delusional", "NTA. You didn't respond to your boyfriend when he said that you valued your dog over him.  Maybe you do. It is just as well that you live separately until you know the answer to this question and others.", "This is a good point: it could take years and he might not get anything. OP, you have stability right now. Think carefully about setting it on fire because you're engaged.", "I have to disagree with you, unless you have more info than I do somehow. (I haven't read through comments to see if OP posted more)\n\nWho said anything about abandoning the dog? OP didn't say that and I didn't say that. Based on what OP wrote, her ex isn't saying that. OP literally said he wanted her and the dog to come out. In fact, the only people complaining about the dogs in this post are you and OP. She's the one that's saying she doesn't know how she feels about her dog with 2 other older, smaller dogs. Her ex is taking in 2 dogs that weren't his when nobody else will! He actually sounds like a very caring guy to me, based on what she wrote, despite how you've framed it. He does need to work on communication, but to give him some benefit of the doubt...sounds like he's dealing with a lot. Everything in her post says to me that he's bending over backwards for the 2 dogs from the parents and his family...and she's choosing the comfort of the dog over his comfort, without any context (because OP didn't give more). She even admits to ghosting him instead of responding to her fiance, which is crazy to me considering what he's dealing with.\n\nIf he said that, she should set a boundary and communicate that he shouldn't say stuff like that to her. She should also 100% tell him that she DOES care and value him and that they need to have a conversation on what's the plan here before she uproots her entire life."]}
