She has a son (my stepkid) from her former marriage. When she found out about the tradition mom has, she said she expects my stepson to get his own custom stocking and be hanged along with the other kids' stockings. I asked my mom and she said that she loves her step grandchild but does not feel comfortable yet to have a stocking of his name and gang it in her home. Apparently, my wife refused to drop it and chose it as a hill to die on and even told me she would not be attending christmas party if mom doesn't do it. We started arguing about it for days. I finally blew up and told her it was not reasonable for me or her to dictate how my mom decorates her home and what stockings she hangs. She started crying and called me 'blind' for not seeing how my family are treating my stepson. I said they love him and a some stocking isn't going to prove anything. She said she wouldn't go then and I called her ridiculous for deciding not to go over something so trivial.\n\n\nWe have been in conflict about it since then and she's refusing to even speak to me.\n\n\nAITAA for saying that it was ridiculous for her to decide not to go over some stockings?\n\n\nMy stepson's age is 9.", "created_utc": 1670506922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfz9u6/aita_for_calling_my_wife_ridiculous_for_saying/", "score": 16600, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother is singling out *a child* from a Christmas tradition that your family has. Your stepson is now part of your family. If your mother can\u2019t even bring herself to have a *sock* with his name on it, then your stepson deserves better than your family. It might only be a stocking to you, but to your wife and *your stepson* it\u2019s going to look like a hell of a lot more than that.", "YTA: 3 years isn't enough? Your mom's a real piece of work.", "YTA. My guy, you\u2019ve been together 3 years. When is your mother gonna be comfortable?", "YTA. Your stepson has been in your life for 3 years. If your mom \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel comfortable\u201d putting a stocking up for him (which really just sounds like an excuse to be exclusionary) she never will. Your wife is 100% right here, your stepson will absolutely feel very hurt and left out if all the other grandkids get a nice customized stocking and he gets nothing. It\u2019s not about a decorating choice, it\u2019s about excluding a kid.", "YTA. It\u2019s not like this is your girlfriend and her son you\u2019re bringing to the family for the first time. It is your wife and stepson. Imagine it from your stepson\u2019s perspective. You\u2019re the ridiculous one along with your mom.", "YTA and so is your mom. Major YTA. How could she feel comfortable leaving your stepson out and why are you okay with that? Of course it's your wife's \"hill to die on\" that's her son getting left out for absolutely no good reason. You should be proud she's the type of woman who puts her kid first. Instead you're trying to make her feel wrong for it. You and your mom are huge AHs.", "YTA - I have 2 half siblings and my father\u2019s side of the family did this to them constantly! They\u2019d go all out with gifts, stockings, the whole 9 for everyone but my half siblings. My mother eventually came to her senses and stopped going to these things because she realized her older children be treated like they were nothing. The moment my \u201cfull\u201d siblings and I were old enough to understand what our father\u2019s family was doing we stopped going as well. Now that we\u2019re all adults, not one of us speaks to anyone on that side of the family.

You are the one being ridiculous if you don't understand why after 3 years your mother still finds it necessary to exclude your step son from having a stocking. It is a stocking that she literally has to put up right before you arrive and can remove when you leave if having it up is \"too much\" for her to have up full time. Think how he feels with every other kid having a stocking and not having one, that's the kind of shit that stays with you throughout life.", "YTA. Your wife is right. You're being blind to your family's exclusion of your stepson. Like it or not, he's a part of the family and should be treated as such.", "YTA\n\nYour mom is making a display of who she considers family and who she does not. She does not consider her step grandson to be family. I\u2019m not saying you should make her hang a stocking, but you should definitely understand why your wife and child feel unwelcome. They deserve to celebrate Christmas somewhere that they are treated like family.", "YTA - I\u2019m 46, and my step grandparents are both gone now.  It took them losing a son and a granddaughter before they started treating me like family.  I was in my 30\u2019s when they started being decent humans to me.\n\nYour wife is a saint.  I would have a much better relationship with my mother today if she had ever made me feel supported and included.  How dare you take something like that at be so mean to a CHILD?", "YTA. My family does custom stockings as well that were made collectively by my mom and aunt. Any time someone new is joining the family for Christmas they get a stocking. Some of those people stay around others may only be there for that year.

You are married. He is your stepson and not going anywhere. Your mother shouldn\u2019t leave him out just because he is not blood if she \u2018loves\u2019 him. Your mom sounds like a JustNo and you are apparently blind to it. YTA.", "YTA. I\u2019d die on this hill too and saying she\u2019s refusing to go just over stockings feels disingenuous to me.

Imagine being a child and seeing stockings with everyone else's name on it but yours. Seeing all the other kids open theirs up and you sit there just watching. That breaks my heart. \n\nThis is not your girlfriend. This is your wife. Her child is now your child and should be treated as such. She has every right to protect her child from that kind of embarrassment and pain. That could cause trauma that lasts for years and forever impacts that child's relationship with you and your family. \n\nI have grabbed extra stockings for my children's friends and girlfriends. If they're at my house when stockings are being opened, they get a stocking. No one will feel left out on Christmas under my watch. You can get them from the dollar store, and fill it with dollar store items. Cost is not an issue, so what is it then besides an intentional act to show one child is not welcomed the same as the others?\n\nSheesh this makes me angry.", "YTA surprise it\u2019s not about the stocking! How many other times has your wife complained about your stepson being treated as second class? Does every other kid have a stocking? Would he be the only one left out?

It's disrespectful to your wife and her kid. Above it all it's MEAN. It's just plain mean, he's a KID why can't he have a little stocking?? Who would it hurt, what bad things will happen if this kid doesn't get a treat? \n\nYour mom saying she doesn't feel comfortable yet implies she doesnt expect your wife and you to stay together, she wont commit to the stocking because she has no faith in your marriage. Doesnt that embarrass you? \n\nThere is no good reason to exclude him other than to be vile. You should have more respect for your wife, and her child and yourself, because this mommas boy bs you seem to be pulling is embarrassing. \nYour wife deserves better.", "YTA and so is your mother. How cruel and thoughtless. I'm gobsmacked. Your wife is being a great mom and is protecting her son from the hurt.", "Yes you\u2019re absolutely TA. 9 year olds don\u2019t understand adult relationship dynamics but they do understand \u201ceveryone got one but me.\u201d Hanging a stocking won\u2019t prove they love him but not hanging one will prove they don\u2019t see him as a part of the family, or that he is \u201cless-than\u201d worthy. \n\nDeep down you probably know she\u2019s right but you\u2019re a coward bc fighting your mom seems too big of a task or will strain your familial relationships.\n\nSorry I prbly will miss any replies, I\u2019ll be out today, I\u2019m going to hike up that hill to die with your wife.", "Excluding a 9-year old? really, f\\*\\*\\* your mom and f\\*\\*\\* you too for defending her, YTA.", "YTA so much. As is your mom. I feel sorry for your wife and her son. I\u2019d totally die on this hill with her. \n\nI can\u2019t wait til your next child (bio of course) has their own stocking and your poor step kid is still Cinderella in the corner. Fun times. \n\nI don\u2019t even know you and I don\u2019t like you.", "YTA your mother is being unwelcoming to your step son, basically saying he's not part of the family. How about you step the fuck up and support your wife and step son?", "YTA and she\u2019s not being unreasonable telling your mom how to decorate her house but she is being reasonable in looking out for the well being of her child.

If your stepson means anything to you, you will not subject him to this. \n\nYour mother is horrible for excluding a child like this. \n\nYou should be skipping Christmas with your mommy if she can\u2019t play nice.", "YTA. When u took her u took her son too. Now he must see all the kids are special but not him? Shame on u and ur mother", "This stuff breaks my heart, I am the step child and so is my daughter, my step fathers parents didn\u2019t treat me any different than their other grandchildren nor did they treat my kids any different, my husband is not my oldest daughters father and his parents never ever treated her any differently, and as a matter of fact my youngest daughter calls her sisters grandmother nan too, no differences. They are children and they feel and know when they aren\u2019t loved. Step up be a man and tell your mother she either includes your step son or you will make your own traditions with your own family\n\nEdit to add: IF your mother \u201cloved\u201d her step grandchild none of this would be an isssue\n\nSorry edit YTA", "YTA - this will be the hugest of deals to the poor kid who is left out.  Good on mom for understanding this and putting her child first.", "If you weren't together for literal years / married I would understand your mother atleast a tiny bit  but honestly...\n\n\n\nShe doesn't feel comfortable hanging an extra stocking? Where is the harm? It isn't a tattoo. That you think this is reasonable at all is crazy to me. \n\n\n\nI would put one up for the kid who is not family and just be there because of whatever reason.", "I\u2019m so glad that child has at least ONE TRUE PARENT WHO CARES. YTA A MASSIVE, GAPING ONE!", "I'm guessing you and your mom watch Disney movies and think the evil stepparents have some valid arguments. \n\nIf your families are combined they are combined. Your stepchild is your child and he is part of your family. If you are protecting your mom's feelings over his, you are not just an AH, you are a terrible parent and partner. \n\nPlease reconsider which side is choosing the wrong hill to die on. Are you really suggesting that the person protecting her child from feeling like an outsider is the irrational one? Or is it the person who would let his mom essentially bully his stepchild?", "YTA - there is no more obvious way of saying \"You are not one of us\" to a child than doing this no-stocking-for-him b.s.\n\nThat you are too blind to see if and feel it's perfectly fine to send him there to be treated that way shows you are not ready to be a father or stepfather. Willingly allowing (and not defending) the child being outcast shows you do not care for him and feel it is perfectly fine that he be blatantly excluded.\n\nYour mother is a real peach btw... she \"loves him\" so much that she thinks destroying him in a comparison to the \"real\" grandkids is acceptable, in the name of supposed tradition. All over a  $10 stocking. Wow. Grandma of the year right there.\n\nSigned, a grandmother who would never treat a child that way in general, let alone one that was family", "YTA\n\nIt costs your mom so little to make a child feel included. Yet she isn't \"comfortable\" enough to do so? Um. Nothing like so very cruelly telling a child he's not \"real\" family to say Merry Christmas. \n\nMy daughter has been dating a guy for less than a year. I have no idea if he'll be The One, but she loves him, he's great, and I want him and my daughter to feel like we accept him and their relationship. So he gets a stocking this year. If I wanted to I could come up with all kinds of excuses not to. He's only been around less than a year...he's spending Christmas with his family...they're not engaged. But the thing is I'd rather come up with reasons to make him feel welcome and accepted here. So a stocking is the least I can do. \n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around how you don't see how hurtful this can be to a child, but you also don't see how it's hurting your wife either. And to be honest, I can't understand why your feelings aren't hurt that your mom isn't accepting every aspect of your marriage. Your mother is sending a loud & clear message that she's not accepting this child and your role in his life. Why? Because he's not \"blood\"? Because she thinks your marriage won't last? Because you have an unhealthy relationship with her? Figure it out before your wife realizes she and her son deserve so much better.", "YTA. The old bint is not being asked to gift half the family inheritance and the 17th century christening spoons to her step-grandchild. Just to treat a guest as included in the family for a few days to the tune of $10 or so. It looks like being Shady Pines for your retirement plans, so think on that.", "YTA. The lack of a stocking proves a lot. How do you think your stepson is going to feel seeing all the other kids names up there but his? And you think the other kids won't notice?!? If your mom loved and accepted them then this shouldn't even be an issue", "YTA - And so is your mom. You don't exclude one kid and make them feel different. That is setting up resentment. My mother would have never tolerated someone being treated this way. In my family even a friend of the family would have gotten a stocking if it was known they'd be around!", "YTA, and so is your mother. Either your step son is a member of the family or he isn't, your mother's \"comfort\" with that shouldn't matter. And you taking her side here is a huge red flag.", "YTA\n\nThis is something that seems trivial to you but would be a big deep hurt that would lead to resentment and feelings of not being included and could produce a deep trauma for your step child. Those kinds of traumas take years to heal. Your wife understands that. And it absolutely is a hill worth dying on.\n\nA small (to you) gesture would make a huge difference to the health of your family in the long run. Think of it in terms of an investment. The investment to your mother is discomfort. The risk is alienating your family. If you\u2019re not willing to work with your mom to make this adjustment now I would prepare for justified resentment and a breakdown of family trust in the future because the message you are sending is that your step child (and by proxy your wife) just aren\u2019t quite good enough to be family. That\u2019s a heavy message.", "YTA. If it's not a big deal then why aren't you defending your step son? If your mom loves your stepson why isn't she comfortable hanging a stocking? She doesn't see him as a true grandkid and how do you think your 9 year old step son is going to feel seeing that he is the only grandkid with no stocking? Kids see more than you think.", "YTA and so is your mother. Way to single out and alienate your step child", "YTA and son of an AH", "YTA and so is your mom. She's a particularly cruel AH too. Three years this kid has been part of your life, when does he become family? Wake up because your mom is intentionally choosing to exclude a kid and make them feel bad on a kid-centric holiday. By not standing up to her, you are complicit in this. If you keep this up, the marriage won't last and your wife won't be to blame, I just hope it's before you have more kids together.", "Yta and your wife is right. Either include everyone or done do the tradition.", "YTA - Your mom is actively excluding your step son. The stocking absolutely is proof they don't love him like family. It's rude.", "YTA. He's a grandchild, he should get a stocking. Your wife is right. It's not a silly hill to die on--she's nipping the exclusion of her child in the bud before it extends to more important matters. If it hasn't already, which I doubt.", "YTA. Her child is supposed to come and be the only child left out?? That's some trauma shit.", "Dude, your mom hates your stepson. Probably hates your wife too. YTA. Your mom is an AH.", "YTA and so is your mom. \n\nWhat kind of person would exclude a nine year old, who they have known since they were six like that? I'll tell you, an asshole. \n\nThis is a hill to die on, and I think most people would agree that If you see any more of a future with your wife and her son, you might want to wake up and take action before it's too late. \n\nClearly you feel the same way as your mother does in regards to her son because if you looked at him as a son and part of your family, you would fight harder for him.", ">something so trivial\n\nSo it's trivial enough that mother dearest can get the fuck over herself and hang the fucking stocking, yeah?\n\nYTA", "YTA - Are you serious? You really expect your wife to bring your step son to a Christmas celebration where is the only child left out of a family tradition? Your mother is completely heartless.", "Of course YTA\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t her child be the hill she dies on.\n\nWhat\u2019s with all these \u201cgrown\u201d men afraid to upset their mothers?", "YTA. So is your Mom. \n\nI\u2019m a step child. My parents got married when I was 11. His family took me in like their own without batting an eyelash, and my grandparents on his side would do anything for me. I can\u2019t imagine my life without their love and acceptance. \n\nI feel really badly for your wife and her kid. You\u2019ve been married to her for THREE YEARS and your mother doesn\u2019t feel comfortable accepting him as her grandchild? Imagine how that feels to YOUR wife and child. \n\nThe fact that you have to even ask if you\u2019re the a-hole here tells me that you don\u2019t make much effort to set boundaries with your mother & stand up for your family - your wife and son. \n\n(Edited for some grammar mistakes)", "YTA to the staaaars! You are a grown ass adult, married with a stepchild, and I refuse to believe that you actually think this is about your mom's decorating choices and not about your mom wielding family traditions like a hammer to insult and exclude your family.\n\nYour mom is clearly and loudly stating that she doesn't respect you or your wife and that she doesn't view your family as legitimate. And also that she's perfectly happy to take out her ire on a child, who is also the only person in this scenario who has no choices about their family.\n\nIt sounds like you also need a refresher on how boundaries work. It's certainly your mother's right to refuse to hang a stocking with her stepson's name on it, however small-minded and mean it is. It's also your wife's right - and responsibility - to protect her son from adults who think he's less-than. \n\nWhat's actually happening here is that your MOTHER is choosing to die on the hill of being aggressively dickish to a child, and your WIFE is exercising her responsibility to protect her son from being insulted and excluded. Your wife is correct.\n\nYour choice is to pick a side: your mother or your wife and stepson. You have the power to fix this by informing your mother that if she's too \"uncomfortable\" to include your family in holiday traditions that you will not be attending, and then follow through.\n\nIf you're not up to the task of standing up for your wife and stepson then yeah. If I were your wife I'd be crying too, because I'd be facing up to the fact that my husband is attempting to force me to choose between my son and my husband, and my son will win every single time. This is the kind of stuff that breaks marriages.", "YTA and your mom too. That child is being blatantly excluded.", "YTA. Your mom is excluding family, stepson or not. That is not very welcoming into the family and I would be very hurt. Youve been married 3 years, why isnt your mom comfortable? That\u2019s ridiculous.", "YTA  we have a similar tradition in our family and when my brother was dating a woman with a child, we had a stocking made with the child\u2019s name because we thought it would be hurtful *if* he saw that he was the only kid without a stocking.  \n\nWe discussed it because we didn\u2019t want to be weird for the girlfriend or her to think the family was being presumptuous about the relationship but decided that making a child feel included was more important", "Yta- imagine being that child and being excluded from everyone at Christmas. This makes my blood boil. I bet your mom is. \u201cChristian woman\u201d\nAs well.", "YTA.\n\nYour mom is also TA.\n\nYour wife is being a (very appropriate) Mama Bear about this. Good for her.", "YTA, absolutely. How hard would it be to include your stepson? Answer: not hard at all. quite frankly I think it\u2019s disgusting your mom said no after you asked. You shouldn\u2019t have even had to ask.", "You are setting this kid up for a lifetime of being the \"other\" in a family, he's been a part of your family for 3 years and it's sad he can't be seen as such. Congratulations, YTA.", "YTA. \n\nIf your stepson was going to be with his dad/not with you/your wife/your family the holidays then not hanging the stocking would be still kinda weird but fine since he wouldn\u2019t be there being deliberately excluded, but it\u2019s messed up to completely single out one of the kids in attendance. \n\nThis is the hill I\u2019d die on too, and I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019d be your wife if my child wasn\u2019t welcomed by your family and you weren\u2019t willing to advocate for him.", "We, humans, thrive on symbolism, everything we do giving out trophies after sports or giving birthday gifts or giving those world's #1 mom mugs, are all some forms of symbolism. We don't have to do anything of these, yet we do. \n\nWhy do you ask? Because symbolism is one way to express our feelings. \n\nNow apply this to your stepson's case. The act of making those socks are a symbolic act of your mom's love towards her children/grandchildren. Denying this act of symbolism toward's your stepson specifically is harsh, cruel and indicative of how she \"really\" feels about him. As this absence of hanging socks is representative of an absence of love towards him. \n\nAgain, one doesn't necessarily have to do this, but if one does it for few and excludes this one person specifically, tells a lot about what they really think!\n\n**Double dose of YTA**, for being blind to your mom's biases and insensitiveness to your own stepson+wife's emotional needs.", "This is absolutely the hill for your wife, the mother of \u201cnot your child,\u201d to die on.

I labeled them from Santa to the people they were meant for. The gifts were the talk of the dorm for MONTHS because no one had any idea who they were from. I hadn't had that much fun in years.", "I wasn\u2019t welcome home one year and was just going to stay at school. My bff invited me home with her. In the 40 min drive her family had a stocking and personalized gifts under the tree for me. It\u2019s is still one of the most amazing things anyone has ever done for me. If you have the chance to be kind, be kind.", "Its downright evil", "That is so much to carry on her shoulders for a teenager (or anyone, really). I am so glad you were able to give her an opposite experience, an experience of love and kindness. I am sure that meant so much to her. Thank you for sharing that story.", "Note too how OP has not responded to ANY comments. OP tell your stepson to come to my house. I\u2019ll have a stocking AND gifts for him and I\u2019ve never met him.", "I've been a stepmom for nearly 18 years now. My mom always bought something for my stepkids at Christmas, attended their graduations when she could, sent wedding gifts, etc. She is thrilled that she is going to be a step-great-grandma in April and has already bought her unborn step-great-grandson far too many clothes. \n\nThat's how you build a family.", "Yeah she was awesome. She is a good example on how to live your religion right. She also once \"converted\" a jewish woman. She was battling c\u00e1ncer and she told her praying to the virgin Mary would give her strength. When the woman said she was jewish, grandma said \"that is okay so was she, you don't have to, but if you want to, do not pray to her like a Saint, talk to her like a collegue\". 2 year later the woman was in remision, still jewish but very devout to her jewish friend the virgin Mary. \nShe did so much more than the people yelling \"gay is sin\".", "I remember one year that a cousin at our family Christmas brought her boyfriend's kids with her. We had never met them, didn't know they were coming. My grandmother disappeared into a storage closet and came back a few minutes later with 2 wrapped gifts for them. She was always prepared, and super classy. I never forgot how excited those kids were.", "This is the mom I strive to be. My kids are still young but I\u2019m sure at some point they will bring home a friend or partner that needs a family holiday. I will gladly be the one to run out on Christmas Eve. This is a life goal and honestly considering grabbing extra stuff now just in case this exact scenario plays out in a few years.", "This right here! When I was a student in a foreign land (dual degree), I did not have money to comfortably travel back to my country for christmas. When my classmates found out about it, not only was I invited to join several families but also these families ended up sending me goodie packages with homemade holiday delicacies and my classmates that were at campus (i.e. muslim etc. so not celebrating christmas) ended up arranging a potluck so that I could get the holiday spirit experience :)\nIt remains my fondest memory of my time there\u2026", "I have spare stockings too. We write our names on them with glitter glue. I'm always ready, lol.", "This is not a random date with a kid, it\u2019s his WIFE and they\u2019ve been together for THREE years. \n\nGood on the mum to not let his family treat her kid as second rate. How hard is it to get another stocking for a 9 year old and make him feel included?!\n\nHe can certainly pick up on being treated differently so yes it\u2019s a big deal. \n\nOP shouldn\u2019t have married the wife unless he was happy to fully take on both her and the son.\n\nAs a side rant (sorry) - I\u2019m always amazed by the amount of effort these guys will go through arguing for days or weeks to stand up against their wives on behalf of their mums but will absolutely under no circumstances do the reverse. They couldn\u2019t say a single word to stand up against their mums, like they are capable of standing up and arguing but only in one direction. \nAnyway, rant over and done. Thank you!", "My mom had a magical secret gift closet. \n\nWhen unexpected kids showed up (blended family. Foster kids. Exchange student without a host... whatever. We picked up a lot of stray kids), they would get a hastily wrapped something. \nTheir stocking wouldn't have a name but there was always something. \n\nHell, one year i was given a jenga game in January because one of my uncle's foster kids really wanted it as his only Christmas wish and my mom had it, planning on giving it to me. \n my mom switched a tag, i was none the wiser, the kid got Jenna and she got it for me the following week. \n\nMy secret gift drawer is not as magical as my mom's, but a kid at my house is getting a damn gift. Heck, my sister is mid- divorce and her bonus child won't be related to me in a month and she still getting a gift from me.", "My parents were the same. Strays were always welcome.", "If the stepson were 19, I'd get it, and he probably wouldn't care. But 9? And she's known him since he was 6? This is just mean!", "I have trouble talking to my dude's aunt because of this. Hardly ever do. \n\nI told her I am estranged from my parents and was essentially raised by my grandparents. I also expressed a desire to adopt (I've had a stroke and I am concerned about risks, still not sure).\n\nNot even two hours later: \"I don't think you can love an adopted child. At least not as much as your own children.\"\n\nI told her that was an absolutely horrible thing to say. She got up from the table and left. Wouldn't speak to me. My dude's mom pressured me into apologizing to her.\n\nThat's only the tip of the iceberg too.\n\nShe got diagnosed with treatable cancer and I still haven't talked to her really, even with pressure from his mom to do so. After all, we aren't related so why should I care, right? \n\nI know it seems harsh but I'm not going to coddle a woman who looked right in my face and essentially told me my parents didn't *really* love me (among a lot of other things) and that I'd never \"really\" love my own child (like she loves hers ofc). You have your own family for that, lady.", "It is probably because he knew deep down what he had done and did not want to face it.", "When I was in my late teens, I was living with my then boyfriend.  He had been away (partying up two hours away in the city while I worked - yes, I was stupid but I was young, dumb and \u201cin love\u201d), and called me on Christmas Eve to say he wouldn\u2019t be home until the day after.  I hadn\u2019t made plans, it was just going to be a normal day really, but the thought of being alone on Christmas sent me into a doom spiral. I called my friend in tears, he told his girlfriend (also a long time friend of mine) and the next thing you know I was whisked off to her house to spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with her family. And to top it off, they somehow found a gift for me, which was so unexpected I nearly cried.  I will never forget their generosity", "Yup this is how op ends up divorced. \u201cIm sorry wife but after 3 years i still dont see your child as our child and im not willing to fight for him against my mommy and i am completely fine with him being the only kid with nothing for xmas\u201d hes a real piece of work", "I go out every year for my step nephew, I never want him to feel left out amongst the army of all my other nieces and nephews. He\u2019s a teenager now but the memory that will always haunt me was when he was 5, through no malice just pure miscommunication and us being new to the situation and my sisters relationship, he didn\u2019t receive a present from our side of the family. The poor child asked my sister if her family didn\u2019t like him or if he was a bad kid. I will do everything to make up that Christmas to him but we can never undo the hurt we did that year. If OP thinks that what his mother is doing isn\u2019t pure cruelty and causing his stepson pain he\u2019s delusional! YTA", "Right? OP is being wilfully ignorant here, claiming that the stocking \"wouldn't prove anything\". Au contraire - the lack of a stocking (and the OPs insistence that said stocking is unnecessary) will prove to the stepkid that he's not considered \"real\" family by the grandmother, and that such an assertion is accepted/encouraged by OP."]}
