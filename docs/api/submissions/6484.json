Taylor is the daughter of my sister Mary and Ben is the son of my sister Yasmine. I love both of those children dearly. I held them the day they were born, changed their diapers, heard their earliest words, told them all sorts of absurd Uncle tall tales and generally watched them grow from babies to children and now into preteens. They are both 11, only 4 months apart in age but they are vastly different. Taylor is a fairly rounded out, she's into the typical pop culture preteen things you'd expect at her age & she also plays sports & has a strong interest in science & the outdoors as well, which is a subject we definitely bond over.\u00a0\n\n\nBen is a different story. Since the age of 8, Ben has been glued to a computer screen of some kind and I can't recall the last time I saw him where he did not spend 90% of the time playing on a computer/ipad/etc. I\u2019m not judging him for this, just a statement of fact, though I do think it's a bit concerning but that\u2019s a issue for his parents. Additionally, though I love him, Ben has become more difficult to like lately. He\u2019s often rude, sarcastic, and acts like a smartass. I know this is partially part of his age but his parents don\u2019t push back against this enough in my opinion. Also worth noting is he is rarely ever wants to participate in any activities that aren't digital. For example, recently we had a family get together at a lake and Ben just stayed inside the whole time.\u00a0\n\n\nRecently my family had a few get-togethers and at one my wife and I were talking about a trip that we are planning for the summer. We recently purchased a camper and we are going to do a road trip to a nearby state to do some rock hunting (We\u2019re both amateur geologists) and we will also stop at some springs and parks and such. This is planned for early summer without solid dates yet. Taylor was very enthusiastic about the idea and asked if she could come along. My wife and I were both ok with this and told her we\u2019d have to talk to her parents. This was done with pretty much my whole family around, including Ben who was on his computer. I know he was at least partially listening because earlier in the conversation he asked if we had a TV in the camper.\u00a0\n\n\nLater I got a call from Yasmine who accused me of favoring Taylor and excluding Ben because I didn\u2019t ask him if he wanted to go too. I told her that\u2019s ridiculous, Ben could have said if he wanted to go and honestly he has never shown any interest in kind of things we'll be doing. Yasmine said we're still leaving Ben out, which I suppose we are but ultimately this is my wife and I\u2019s trip and I don\u2019t want to spend big chunks of the time dealing with attitude, or fighting to get Ben to come along with us, otherwise I foresee at least one of us having to miss out on many activities because Ben will refuse to do them and just want to stay in the camper.\u00a0\n\n\nSo AITA for not asking (and not planning on asking) Ben if he wants to come along?\n\nEdit: We didn't invite anyone, Taylor jumped in and asked when we were describing the trip if she could come along.", "created_utc": 1672854456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1039uzr/aita_for_not_inviting_my_nephew_to_come_on/", "score": 1522, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially on a holiday you hadn't planned to invite them to at any point. \n\nYour niece asked, she was interested and you kindly agreed to take her. I see no issues with this. \n\nDifferent if you were doing an activity they both liked and purposely excluded one. NTA.", "**NTA** Surely it's completely normal for two different cousins to start doing different kinds of things?  Not everybody has to be included in every activity.  *Especially* if you're the uncle, not the parent.  Everybody knows children, especially boys and girls, develop at different rates at different ages.  \"When you want to join in with our adult-type activities, we'll be happy to have you along.\"  Over their lifetimes, there will be many times when one comes with you for something and the other does not.  This is just the first of those occasions.", "NTA. No favoritism exists here, because you didn\u2019t invite either one of them. Taylor is going because she asked permission and everyone agreed. Ben doesn\u2019t want to go anyway, and his mom is TA.", "NTA Methinks Yasmine wanted a week without Ben.", "NTA\n\nMy guess is Ben doesn\u2019t even want to go, but his parents want him to.  He was there, didnt express any interest, and would likely hate it.", "NTA. It's obvious that Ben's interests and your interests are quite difficult and he wouldn't be a pleasant travel companion. Kid needs to learn that attitude has consequences.", "NTA, perhaps bad judgment that you asked your neices parents in front of everyone so that this did become a publically debatable event. I don't see how your extricate yourself cleanly by any choices now. Each road has bumps, but NTA.", "NTA.  Why invite someone who is a PITA?  You reap what you sow and Ben's surly behavior kept him off the invite list.", "NTA", "NTA. Why bring someone along who clearly is not into it. You are not favouring you are just being realistic. I'm sure you'd happily bring him along if you were doing some computer thing he would actually like.", "NTA. The difference is the niece enthusiastically asked to join while nephew didn\u2019t show interest, and you know he won\u2019t be interested in rocks and parks and campers. He\u2019ll be happily playing call of duty while you\u2019re happily enjoying nature, everyone doing what they enjoy. It does suck that now you have to bring an 11 year old on your intimate trip with you wife. You weren\u2019t the one that showed favoritism, but rather the kids showed their interests.\n\nI grew up a Ben, when we would rent beach houses as a family I would bring my xbox along because I hated the beach. I had fun playing cod at home all day (besides shitty beach house wifi), everyone else had fun getting sunburned and sandy, then we\u2019d all have fun going out for a meal. No point bringing someone to a situation you know they won\u2019t have a good time being in.", "NTA and it strains the bounds of credulity that your sister could even suggest that. Taylor enthusiastically asked if she could come; Ben said: \u201cIs there a TV in the camper?\u201d Like what are you supposed to do here, beg a kid to come on a vacation that they won\u2019t enjoy, which will inevitably lead you and you wife to not enjoy your vacation, just to give your sister a break?", "Definitely NTA. This was YOUR trip, not a planned 'with the niece/nephew' trip. Taylor invited herself and you accepted. Ben heard and could have also piped in that he wanted to go, but he piped in with his requirement (is there a tv) and when his requirement wasn't met, he didn't ask to go. If you ask Ben to go, I have a strong feeling Yasmine will pressure him to go, against his will, and he will be one unhappy camper. Maybe next year he'll be interested in other things beyond screen time, but it won't kill him to not go this time.", "NTA. Yasmine is mad that she won't have a chance to dump her irritating kid on someone this upcoming summer. She's not concerned about her kid feeling left out, she's concerned she doesn't get a kid free vacation. Ben would not bring anything to the trip other than attitude. Taylor is going to help make great memories. You didn't even ask Taylor, she brought it up. If Ben were interested, that would have been his time to speak up. \n\nNo, this is his mom upset she doesn't get rid of him. And an 11 year old being a rude and sarcastic smartass? That's not the age. That is on his parents.", "NTA.\n\nClearly, Ben will not enjoy and doesn't like partaking in outdoor activities.\n\nForcing him to come would make everyone miserable. Yasmine needs to entertain her own kid.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou can bring anyone you want.\n\nAnd how much fun would Ben really have anyway?", "NTA. You are allowed to ask/not ask whomever you want on a trip. I don't blame you for not wanting to deal with a nephews attitude while doing something you and your wife enjoy.", "Pull him aside and say \u201chey buddy, I\u2019d love to have you along but it\u2019s going to be an unplugged event for several days. You down for that? Pinky promise?\u201d", "NTA for not asking him to come, but please be careful how you act/talk around Ben. You do come off as having a favorite, and that could really hurt him (and contribute to him being \"unlikable.\" I have a teenager and two pre-teens, so I definitely understand the attitude can be a bit much). Kids hear and pick up on more than you'd think.\n\nWith that out of the way, there's a difference between treating kids equally, and forcing one to do something the other likes but he doesn't, just to keep things \"even.\" It doesn't sound like Ben would want to go on a geology trip, because there's no internet connection in the camper. \\*However.\\* I do recommend you find some way to spend some one-on-one time with Ben and do something that HE would like. Take him to ComicCon, or something like Blizzcon, or purchase tickets so he can see the Overwatch League compete live against other teams, that sort of thing.", "NTA, Taylor asked to go and Ben didn't.", "Mmmm. I'm gonna say NTA. However. \n1. Taylor was too forward and a bit rude to invite herself to your vacation. Normal thing for a kid to do though and shows her enthusiasm for what you are going to do. She asked, you could've said no but you didn't so I'll assume it doesn't make you uncomfortable to take her with you.\n2. Ben would probably not enjoy it. BUT. The polite thing is to ask him. He can say no. I wouldn't ask him in front of his parents but I would tell him that if he wants he can come.\n3. If he did want to come with you, I would take BOTH kids and set some rules for the trip. Clearly and firmly. If there's something they don't want to do they are old enough to stay in the van watching a movie or whatever. \n\nAll of this assuming that he doesn't have terrible behaviour. Talking back to and having conflicts with parents as a preteen/teen is very normal but they usually don't have the confidence to talk that way to other adults, like uncles and such. You are the one who know him best but if you agreed to take him and laid down the rules and consequences he probably would behave.", "NTA! I think it\u2019s toxic for people to expect other people to invite or include their kids. At the end of the day if it\u2019s so important for her son to go she can pay up and go with him. Don\u2019t give excuses or apologize. It is what it is.", "Gentle.  If he is asking if you  have a TV in the camper, you will be stuck with him watching TV all day, so I would not want to invite him, but next time do not invite others in front of him", "NTA at all. Taylor sounds like she has interests. Ben sounds like he has an addiction. Is it his fault? Probably not. \n\nTell him you\u2019ll take him but there\u2019s no iPad or video games allowed. Maybe that\u2019ll open his eyes to the world.", "NTA. I would say you could take Ben on a \"starter\" trip to see if he is interested in these outings in the future. Something small and easygoing  to see if he even vibes with this sort of stuff once he is removed from everyday life.", "NTA in ANY way\n\nTechnically, you did not even invite your niece. You talked about a trip and she asked to come. If he wanted to come then he could have asked as well. He didn't. I would be respectful but advise my sister that it is your decision on what you do and who you are inviting. \n\nIf you bring a kid to something that he does not want to go to it WILL not be a good time for everyone else. Unfortunately, it sounds like your sister is making your nephew entitled. He obviously did not want to go otherwise he would ask to and then your sister calling you to try and make you feel bad about it. It does not look good.\n\nThe best case scenario is that he stays in the camper the entire time and you, your wife and niece go out and have fun. The worst case is you force him to go with you, he complains and argues the entire time. Everyone has a crummy time and then you deal with this on the NEXT camping trip you go on and he doesnt go.", "You will be the a-hole  if you don't invite Ben, but setting some ground rules on both kids attending may resolve the issue.  Tell both kids that this will be an electronic-free trip and that they will be required to participate in the activities . . . In other words, there will not be a situation in which the group has to be divided so that some can participate and others don't.\n\nI think if you set these requirements, Ben will naturally opt out if it is not his cup of tea and then the sister can only blame her son, and not you.", "I could swear I've read this one before a few weeks back.", "NTA but  mildly rude. Taylor was rude, too, to invite herself on your vacation, but she's a kid. However, you shouldn't have said yes in front of Ben without inviting him, too. You could have put Taylor off and addressed the issue with her parents and her later.  I would not want to bring Ben along either because he does sound like he would stay inside the whole time either watching TV or on his computer, and it changes the nature of the trip if one person refuses to join in. However, I disagree that you have to babysit an 11 year old who wants to hang out in your camper while you explore the park.  He's old enough to stay behind and watch tv or do whatever without you.", "NAH. I feel like your feelings are valid here based on what you've said, but I'd spend some time with him before and cater a day to his interests. Otherwise, you'd be TA.", "NAH. You might offer Ben but tell him there won't be any electronics allowed or working. He'll say no.", "Yta just ask him he would say if he wants to go or not and she\u2019s right you are playing favorites", "YTA you have to ask him. Maybe he can tell that you don't like him a lot, and he notices that you are treating him differently. You have to treat them equally even when one of them is more \"difficult\"", "YTA\n\n>Ben could have said if he wanted to go\n\nIt is incredibly rude to ask to go on someone else's vacation. So no, Ben could not reasonably say he wanted to go too. And you were very obviously playing favorites.", "YTA, just ask if he wants to come too, if he doesn't he'll say.", "YTA- he\u2019s a kid and it would be rude of him to ask to come along. As the adult, ask Ben if he\u2019d also be interested in camping, hiking and looking for rocks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If Ben wanted to come, he could have asked like his cousin did. You are under no requirement to invite people on your vacation.", "NTA.", "NTA  but sounds like the kid needs a break from his own head. Say if he comes there will be no screen time unless prescribed, he cant brings tablets or games or phones and I suspect he will make the decision for you. If he wants to go, tbh, this might be the break he needs from all that. Engrossed in gaming all the time can make people seem self centred, quick to anger,and he clearly hasn't had great limit setting from his parents. Perhaps this is what he needs to get him back on track?", "NTA", "NTA. It seems clear to me that OP was caught off guard by the request. Only in redditland do people have the perfect answer at the drop of a hat. There's also this idea that siblings need to be treated exactly the same otherwise the OP is a monster. Ben is an AH. There is mitigation in that he's a kid growing up and will presumably settle down and be less of an AH in the future but he's an AH now. I see nothing wrong in Taylor making the request, kids are cheeky acquisitive monkeys, always pushing at boundaries. It's a tough call as to whether OP would be an AH if she did not invite Ben but I am going for NTA provided this does not become a pattern.", "NTA but maybe you should consider better engaging with Ben in his interests. It isnt his fault that you don't have similar interests, but as the adult you could do more. Maybe see if there is a gaming convention in town or similar, he deserves your time and attention as well", "NAH  Your nephew asking about TV in the camper was him fishing for an invite most likely. It at least does show he has an interest in spending time with you all. Doesn't mean you have to invite him, especially if it means ruining the trip for any of you. Obviously your sis is mad because she feels like you excluded her boy, but has he expressed being upset he wasn't invited?  If yes then maybe talk to him only so the distance between you doesn't grow.", "You might enjoy the movie The Way Way Back.  Try to remember that every kid is different.  Give Ben an opportunity to shine (not necessarily on this trip).  Have you tried engaging with him on the things he likes?  Let him teach you a game?  I get that he\u2019s not like you - maybe he needs someone to take an interest in what he\u2019s interested in.  If no one else in your family is like him, and no one encourages his interests, that might explain why he\u2019s not the friendliest kid.  Don\u2019t discount him because he\u2019s an introvert who likes video games.\n\nETA\u2014forgot to say you\u2019re NTA about the trip.  It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019d enjoy it.  But I do think he might feel left out, even if he doesn\u2019t want to go (if that makes sense).  It\u2019s hard to be the different one.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019d say Y-T-A of you had invited one over the other, but that\u2019s not what happened. Taylor asked to come along and Ben did not. I\u2019d tell Ben\u2019s parents that if he comes to you independently and wants to be included you will of course take him, but if he doesn\u2019t express any interest then you won\u2019t force the issue", "I'm going to go with a very soft YTA, I can't blame you for not wanting him along but extending an invite to her and not to him, in front of him, is pretty insensitive.\n\nI realize she asked but you could have brushed her off and changed the subject to avoid hurting Ben's feelings and discussed it later.\n\nThat said, just because Ben doesn't outwardly express interest doesn't mean he isn't. He could just be shy and not want to impose. It's possible he has other interests he doesn't get to explore and finds electronics as his only outlet. I can certainly related to that.", "YTA, sorry he\u2019s a moody kid? He\u2019s at that age where it looks like he\u2019s isolating himself but you\u2019re treating him differently and basically telling him he\u2019s not invited. Even if he says no, you should\u2019ve just offered. What was the harm in saying hey buddy wanna come with? The worst thing he can say is no, but he\u2019ll remember that you CARED ENOUGH TO ASK. Yeesh, who plays mind games with a CHILD? \nThe always online part isn\u2019t good it\u2019s pretty toxic for a kid to be online to begin with but it\u2019s not your jurisdiction his parents will hv to deal with that.", "YTA for talking about it in front of Ben. Best response would have been, \"we will discuss if you can come along later\". That said, I get why you wouldn't want Ben on this type of trip. My son and daughter were polar opposites and my son hated outdoors activities. I mistakenly took them both on a trip that involved kayaking, parasailing and more and my daughter missed out on many activities she would have enjoyed as my son wouldn't leave the TV/condo. \n\nCan you find something in common with Ben and do that separately? Comic book convention? Video game convention? Ask him to teach you gaming?", "YTA.  You have your favorite, let's be honest.  I'm going to tell you that I know what it feels like when an uncle clearly has a favorite nephew/niece.  It's a crappy feeling.", "Very light ESH \n\nYes, it WAS your and your wife's trip first and foremost. However, that did change when you decided to allow Taylor to join even if you didn't outright invite her. At this point if you don't also offer for Ben to attend it would look like favoritism, even if it wasn't intended to be (although it looks like that's exactly what it was).\n\nParenting aside, they are both 11 years old and while they can understand a good bit at that age their brains are no where near fully developed to be able to fully understand the dynamics of this situation. You would not be TA if you invited both or invited/agreeed to take neither, but its an AH move to include one and not offer to the other.", "I didn't invite anyone, Taylor asked if she could come when we were describing the trip we were planning and after my wife and I exchanged affirmative looks we told her yes. If Ben had asked to come along we would have told him the same thing, granted we might have followed up with a conversation later in private about what the expectations were and all that, but I wouldn't have told one of them yes and then denied the other", "It's not his responsibility to take his nephew anywhere. Perhaps his mom and dad could do it?", "They don\u2019t have to do anything. They\u2019re going on a rock hunting trip; and this kid is balls deep into Roblox probably.", "Taylor asked if she could go and that\u2019s the only reason she\u2019s going now. They didn\u2019t invite her, I think it completely normal, especially for children of the same age, to hear one person ask for something you\u2019d think it\u2019s okay to ask too", "He\u2019s 11 do you think he knows what rude is? If he wanted to go, he would\u2019ve asked to go when he overheard the plans. Kids do that all the time", "OP didn't invite anybody though, Taylor asked them. If Ben wants he can join 'em too", "What if he says yes, though? OP clearly doesn't want to take unethusiastic preteen who doesn't like outdoors on a trip.", "It\u2019s always crazy that people think video game kids don\u2019t like things outside. I grew up a video game kid and would have loved things like camping but my parents never wanted to do that stuff. Habits/interests can very heavily favor how much effort parents are willing to/can put in.  OP also claiming not to have a favorite while very positively painting one kid over the other night show how the kid is always treated so he becomes more recluse", "Did you read the OP?  The worst the kid could say is \"yes\" (not no) and actually come and then be a buzzkill the whole time according to the OP.  I don't see any \"mind games\" here at all.  \n\nIt is not the OP's child so there is no firm obligation exists and why should the OP have to potentially ruin their good time just to extend an invite to a kid who sounds like he would have a miserable time if he came, along with ruining everyone else's time.", "OK, I would have said, lets talk later.", "Bottom line, you're taking Taylor on a major vacation. Are you doing anything to give equivalent time to Ben or to engage with Ben in a similar way?", "It isn't responsibility no- but it never hurts to try and connect with a kid at something more their level if you want to be in their life. It's up to OP whether they want to try and nurture a relationship with Ben.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand this is OP's interest. If they want to engage with their nephew this is one of many ways they could do it- show Ben that there is no game of favorites and that his uncle still wants to connect with him. I was just suggesting something that could help mend fences and help Ben explore and grow.", "Yeah, Taylor was rude when she did that. And OP didn't then look at whether the situation was equitable or feel out if the other kid had any interest. These are kids - to have a relationship with a kid, especially an introverted one like the nephew you can't just wait for them to come to you, or expect them to make the ask to spend time with you.", "Or he was shy or nervous of being rejected because he already has the vibe that OP doesn't like him as much - which was real clear from the post.", "I was the same at that age but would've loved to opportunity to to go out for the summer like that, being indoors a lot doesn't mean he wouldn't enjoy the trip, it just means its out of his comfort zone, it may take a day or 2 to adjust", "Yeah, I lived with my grandparents as a kid. They loved to criticize me gaming but all they ever wanted to do was watch TV. And to add on top of that they were super controlling and barely let me see friends. \n\nSo it was either TV, games, or go outside and kick rocks alone. I chose games but there was so much more I wanted to do. I was jealous of all the kids that got to go hunting, fishing, camping, etc. \n\nAnd now as an adult I'm stuck in the same loop because I don't know how to do any of those things ,where to start, or have anyone to go with. But that's totally unrelated.\n\nKids are products of their environment.", "It\u2019s his nephew not some random kid. So what if he comes and is a buzzkill? He\u2019s a KID don\u2019t take it so harshly, be patient and he\u2019ll come around", "sure, in hindsight. it came up naturally, OP responded to what was presented in real time. Later all the tangents poked their heads up. It's also true that one more is one more and two more is two more. Especially in a camper. Which is to say, one more might be tolerable and two more might not be.

I am disabled and have been for my entire life, but I had no idea of this until recently (I\u2019m an adult now). I had no idea what was wrong with me, why I hated doing physical things that others liked. I felt pathetic and weak and like I wasn\u2019t trying hard enough, so I would do my best and still get pushed to do more by my peers and the adults around me, and it made me really upset. With a disability diagnosis, all of it finally makes sense.\n\nI\u2019m not saying Ben has an unseen disability, and him being a smartass does suck. I\u2019m just saying please be careful when interacting with people who may not do a lot of physical stuff and may be very interested in a lot of screentime.

The equitable thing to do would have been something like turning to Ben and saying, \"What about you? Are you interested in a week spent out in the mud and rocks with no internet access and no electronics?\" and of course, Ben would say no because frankly that sounds awful (different strokes and all that.) But you didn't observe the niceties and someone's feelings got hurt.

They need to learn to deal.", "Exactly, the onus isn\u2019t on OP to make Ben want to be outdoorsy kid just because Taylor is or because they want him to get off the computer or be more social.\n\nAnd while I do think it couldn\u2019t hurt to limit his computer time a little at least in favor of another activity, even if it\u2019s just reading, I will say:\n\nI was a kid who grew up in the early 90s and became introduced in the middle of my childhood to screen time but I was not born into it. I still always enjoyed solo activities, like drawing and reading. Once computers were introduced I began to enjoy reading online, and developing websites in basic form. I was quite introverted, but enjoyed socially with my very small friend pool. However, I did eventually grow to like hiking, paddle boarding and became more extroverted. I would know consider myself an introverted extrovert. I\u2019m very good socially and had a life of the party phase, but I didn\u2019t do it often and enjoy my space and get exhausted when to many people are in it.\n\nParents should always encourage activities to kids, but they need to ultimately let them make the choice for themselves, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with putting a time limit or a \u201ctime and place\u201d on activities that you feel they are either too engrossed or that can be unhealthy in excess, without pulling them all together or forcing them out of their comfort zone. I think part of the reason that I was able to come out of my shell was that my mom was really good about that. (My dad on the other hand tried to force every activity, they were all things HE wanted me to do, and would force me to do them for hours either because he felt they were more academic or because he wanted me to be better at them and thought forcing time into them would make me great. I wound up resenting those hobbies and him, and while I became or could\u2019ve been extremely good at some of them, ultimately decided I hated doing them. It also caused a lot of unnecessary turmoil in our relationship. Some of them are things that I realize in hindsight I actually enjoyed and would like to do again, but I can\u2019t get past the resentment they bring up.)\n\nIt\u2019s *okay* to allow a time limit or a certain time for certain activities like tv and computer. It\u2019s not okay to throw a kid at sports and summer camp or even theatre and expect them to suddenly like it or enjoy it. You wouldn\u2019t take your sports enthused extroverted kid and throw them at a book club or a computer club right? Moderation is okay, introducing kids to the idea of new things is great, but forcing kids to do things they don\u2019t enjoy is not only not okay, but will just make them hate those things.", "If he showed interest also and you didn't extend the invite then you would be more likely to be the AH, but I'm pretty sure he'd hate the entire thing.
