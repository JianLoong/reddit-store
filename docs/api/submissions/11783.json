We will be away for a month to stay out-of-state at our respective parents homes, meaning we will not be together for the time being.\n\nI told her we should drive our own cars separately, and that she should have it available to her just in case. She thought otherwise, saying gas would be expensive, and she doesn\u2019t really have a need for a car because she doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go or anything to do. She hates driving and prefers to be a passenger princess.\n\nSo, we hopped into my car and off we went. After a long, sore drive, we finally arrived at my parents place, and I wanted to rest a bit before driving her 30 minutes away to her parents place. She got annoyed because she wanted to get home ASAP.\n\nFast forward to today, she asked me to drive her to her spontaneous medical(beauty surgeon?) appointment. I got annoyed because this was exactly what I was talking about when I said she should take her own car with her.\n\nI expressed my annoyance, and we got into an argument. Eventually I said I\u2019ll drive her, but next time she should take my advice. She then refused me and said she would take a bus home and drive her car back here.\n\nShe argued that she offered to drive me places when I needed a ride in the past, and that I am being an asshole for being unwilling to drive her this time. The only times she would drive me were if there were no viable options for me.\n\nI hate it when people depend on me, especially if there are easy solutions to overcome that dependence. I would\u2019ve been alright to drive her if she had no choice, but this is the result of her refusing to drive her own car.\n\nSo right now my annoyance comes from her dismissing my advice, brushing off the possibility that she might need a car, and putting full dependence on me even though she is a 30 minute drive away.\n\nAlso, our parents are quite busy, so we are not putting anything on them.\n\nAITA?\n\n- \n\nEdit: our place is 4 hours away from my parent\u2019s place, i had to drop off my younger brother there before continuing the drive 30mins to her parent\u2019s place, so I just wanted a short break in between\n\n\nAppointment is 30 minutes away from her parent\u2019s place, not back home\n\n\nMy car is manual, and she can\u2019t drive manual.\n\n\nI think I might have worded it a little too harshly. *Hate* is not the right word.\nWhat I meant to say was, if there\u2019s no need for dependency on me, she shouldn\u2019t create it in the first place. Basically I got promoted from bf to chauffeur.\nI\u2019d be happy to help in case of emergencies and such, even if she\u2019s not my gf. The fact that she is my gf, naturally I would be the one of the first people she\u2019d depend on. I am totally fine with that.\n\nShe is able to drive without any issues, she just doesn\u2019t like driving.

I have all the patience in the world for someone who is clearly in need, someone who really tries to take care of things on their own but just needs a little help right now.   I have zero patience for someone who isn't trying, could easily handle it themselves -- ***they just don't want to***.   The gf sounds very high maintenance.   She chose dependence - it seems to be her happy place.  Think about that when making long term plans.", "NTA. That's a lot of driving for an appointment she could reschedule to be when you all are back at your place.", "NTA sadly you don't track driving hours", "NTA this is weaponized incompetence.

She should have talked to you before booking. It's a 2 hour round trip for you, it's unreasonable to book this without asking you. Why couldn't her parents drive her? Why couldn't she take public transportation? Why couldn't she take an uber? It feels really disrespectful to book this and not even consider alternative transportation methods.\n\nIn my personal opinion it doesn't make sense to drive 2 cars over such a long trip, especially if she really dislikes driving. You paid for gas and possibly tolls, you know how much it costs. I guess it depends on the household but in mine sharing a ride wouldn't need to be a discussion, it would be implied. I'm sure there a more reasonable way to do this (eg: lunch at your parents, dinner at hers, then go your separate ways). \"I hate it when people depend on me\" is a bit of a yellow flag when you're talking about your significant other. Being dependant on eachother is a natural outcome of a relationship.", "Esh - it doesn't make sense to drive two cars when you're going to roughly the same journey. Driving her to her parents first and then dropping your brother off where you were staying would have made the most sense. She sucks for scheduling the beauty appointment.", "Nta. This is a normal argument", "INFO: How long of a drive is it between your home and your parents? Were you were supposed to drive her to her parents and go back to your parents house again? EDIT: Could her parents not drive her to the beauty surgeon?", "NTA\n\nYou offered a solid compromise, she didn\u2019t listen and is being petty af about it. Be careful this doesn\u2019t creep into other parts of your relationship OP.", "ESH.\n\nYou for calling her a \"passenger princess\", when you know she doesn't like driving. Her for springing an appointment on you out of the blue that she expected you to drive her to.\n\n\nWhy does she hate driving? You don't say, and it's important. If she gets panic attacks, dizzy spells, etc, it may actually be unsafe for her to drive.", "NTA.\n\nYou advised her upfront that it would make sense for her to bring her call to her parents, she chose not to and as a result has become dependent on you. That said, she's your GF that you live with. If you plan to stay together for the long term you need to pick your battles, taking her to a medical appointment should not be one of them.", "It sounds like you don\u2019t actually love your girlfriend.   Although she could certainly have made the 4 hour drive herself, I\u2019m guessing she thought it might be nicer to spend those 4 hours each way with you, rather than by herself.   Sure, she said she wouldn\u2019t need her car, and then suddenly needed a ride from you, so she is a bit of an AH in that way.   But, looking at it from her perspective, she\u2019s going to be away from you for a month - this might have been a chance to spend some time with her, which it looks like you don\u2019t actually want.\n\nThe fact that she decided to take a bus back home to go get her car tells me you probably won\u2019t have a girlfriend when you get home, which is just as well.\n\nMy husband frequently drives me places I could drive to myself because he enjoys my company and vice versa.  Although your girlfriend shouldn\u2019t have made an appointment she couldn\u2019t get to, I\u2019m going to vote YTA for obviously not wanting to spend time with someone you should actually miss and care for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they took two separate vehicles then they wouldn\u2019t need to be apart for a month she could drive up to see him or they could meet in the middle somewhere.

How can you have a take this just\u2026.wrong? You can\u2019t see a reason to take two cars? What about the literal exact scenario that OP is in.

Then practically as soon as they get there she needs to be driven on a 2 hour round trip for a spontaneous appointment that she didn\u2019t mention. So she either 1. Made the appointment before hand and insisted on taking one car knowing that would mean OP would have to make that two hour round trip to take her, or 2. She made it while already there, knowing that she didn\u2019t have a car and OP would have to make the trip. Either way NTA on OPs part at all.

Whenever I was in a new relationship, I\u2019d be eager to spend every possible moment with my partner, including doing things I would never enjoy (like stripping the paint off his car, going to motocross meets, etc.).  My point was more that, you don\u2019t seem excited to spend time with your girlfriend.   I\u2019ve been married over 30 years, and I would still choose being in the car with my husband over getting somewhere efficiently.\n\nTo each his own - I hope the two of you can work it out and manage your expectations on what you will and won\u2019t do for your partner.", "True enough.
