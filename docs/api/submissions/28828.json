Basically, she demanded me to pay her back for covering my share of the children\u2019s expenses during our divorce if I have now money.

Your finances are NOT your ex-wife's business.", "NTA, what? that's your money, your kids are grown. sounds like she just wanted you to be poor forever and got mad when you weren't.", "NTA. You don't owe her squat. Divorce is finalized and it seems like you started the business *afterward* anyway (she re-married as it is and as far as I know, that disqualifies you from alimony from the previous spouse), and the kids are older than 18. Tell her this cash cow is off to greener pastures.", "The fact that your daughter came to you for help with costs is indicative that your ex has ran out of money OR hes husband isn't as generous anymore.

The money was never for her, but for your children and it's still going towards the children (like paying graduation costs), it's just not going through her anymore.", "NTA at all. Your ex is insane to ask for such a thing. You owe her nothing. You both made the agreement to contribute what you could and that was, literally, done. She doesn't get to change your previous agreement now because you started a business later and are better off and your business is continuing to grow. (Nice!)\n\nShe too, wound up better off marrying a guy who made more money.

Why did you have to pay for the trips they took with your ex and her husband? You said you had shared custody, which I think means each pais for when the children stay with the respective parent and a share of shared expenses ( car, I don't see trips as being part of this honestly). Did they contribute with more than half? I don't understand what she thinks she is entitled to. Your job came recently, of course you don't owe her anything. Do you have legal documents for the shated custody and money part or was everything just verbally agreed?", "NTA, you don't owe any child support because none was agreed with the courts and it sounds like you held up your end of the bargain even without the courts. \n\nWhy would she think you owe her more though?

Thats a hard NTA.", "If this happened when they were children, she could have filed for a modification of child support, at which time they'd examine both of your incomes, your parenting time, etc. But they're in their 20s.

You don't owe her anything. She really shouldn't even have been calling for that. \n\nNow, you could have maybe been slightly more polite and just said you had started a different financial oppurtunity recently and this was new money, but how you make now that the kids are grown really isn't her issue. \n\nIf she does want you to give her more from back then, maybe she need to pay 50% of the grab school costs? See what she says.", "INFO\n\nDid you split custody time evenly? If you indeed earned the same amount until the kids were 18, and had the children an equal number of days during the week, and both of you split their necessities (school costs, clothes, healthcare, sports fees) evenly, then this sounds like a fair split. Her and her husband wanting to splash out extra for a trip to Italy or to buy the children fancy new cars when they turned 16 is not a necessity. That's on them if they want to spend their money that way.\n\nHowever this sentence gives me pause if it refers to day to day child expenses, not just trips to Italy:\n\n>**I contributed as much as I could then the ex covered the rest.**\n\nThis is not how child support works, and if you had a child support order enforced by the court, perhaps you would have been required to pay more. So if she had to pay all the school fees, sports fees, health insurance, clothes, braces, and then the day they turned 18, you miraculously came into money... then no, I don't think you need to pay HER a cent, but just like you are paying for your daughter's grad school, you might want to be generous when it comes time to pay for weddings or help with down payments and then make sure your kids know that this is team effort and that mom was the one paying for things when they were growing up.", "Omfg. There are so many idiots that don't know shit about child support.  Nta, but you might get your ass handed to you by a court.  Every state has their own laws on child support.  Even if you two had a written agreement, if it wasn't through the courts, they can still throw it out.  \nLook up your local laws and ask a lawyer. The court can deem you need to pay child support for the entire time possibly.  And it'll all be due in 5 days or less most of the time.  How they pro rate how much and at one time also depends all on the judge and lawyers.  Some have formulas, some don't, and even then, they can add on to that number.  \nSo sure, you don't and shouldn't, but when it comes to kids, the courts are rigged against men. So CYA.", "If it's court ordered that you owe her money then yes, YTA but if there's no court order then I guess you got lucky in having an ex wife who could give your kids a better life than you could.", "NTA.\n\nChild support is wrong.", "I reckon the OPs ex is convinced that he was hiding his income until the children aged out of child support. \nI wonder if she\u2019s right. \nOP could easily be the AH.", "Info: did you tell her you were no longer at your job, hadn't been since 2020, and the business you and your brother started is what's allowing you to be more generous now? \n\nIf you haven't talked to her for years I can understand her being suspicious that you were not contributing more when you could have when the kids were young, but demanding back \"child support\" at this point is still off the wall.", "Potentially YTA - this is highly dependent on if you are in the USA and what state you live in.  If you don\u2019t live in the USA or your state has different rules, ignore this and figure out what your laws are for this.  You didn\u2019t tell her your salary changed.  I highly suggest you find out when your salary became greater than hers and when your children aged out of child support.  Talk with a lawyer about what the formula in your state is for child support and work with an accountant to make sure that any back child support is corrected.  She most likely will easily win that amount in court, no use in wasting a ton of money on lawyers to pay what is legally due to her based on the formula.  You may have met that with what you gave her already, but you need to make sure you have that covered.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your ex wife's relationship, nor the amount of income their partner makes, has any impact on your life, income, or budget.

Heck, the fact that you contributed anything to a vacation they chose to take is surprising, and if they chose to get the kids new cars, knowing you couldnt afford half, then they knew they were picking up the slack. If you talk to any judge, they dont base support on 50/50 splits of costs, they base it on the income of the parent. And if a parent ends up making more later down the road, they will increase the support, but they dont make the parent pay any kind of back support based on the new income. The fact that your ex expects you to pay her, \"back,\" for the stuff her and her husband paid for is crazy. They made the choice to pay for what they did, not thinking you would be paying them back.
