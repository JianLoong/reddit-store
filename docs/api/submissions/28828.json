Basically, she demanded me to pay her back for covering my share of the children\u2019s expenses during our divorce if I have now money.

Your finances are NOT your ex-wife's business.", "NTA, what? that's your money, your kids are grown. sounds like she just wanted you to be poor forever and got mad when you weren't.", "NTA. You don't owe her squat. Divorce is finalized and it seems like you started the business *afterward* anyway (she re-married as it is and as far as I know, that disqualifies you from alimony from the previous spouse), and the kids are older than 18. Tell her this cash cow is off to greener pastures.", "The fact that your daughter came to you for help with costs is indicative that your ex has ran out of money OR hes husband isn't as generous anymore.

The money was never for her, but for your children and it's still going towards the children (like paying graduation costs), it's just not going through her anymore.", "NTA at all. Your ex is insane to ask for such a thing. You owe her nothing. You both made the agreement to contribute what you could and that was, literally, done. She doesn't get to change your previous agreement now because you started a business later and are better off and your business is continuing to grow. (Nice!)\n\nShe too, wound up better off marrying a guy who made more money.

Why did you have to pay for the trips they took with your ex and her husband? You said you had shared custody, which I think means each pais for when the children stay with the respective parent and a share of shared expenses ( car, I don't see trips as being part of this honestly). Did they contribute with more than half? I don't understand what she thinks she is entitled to. Your job came recently, of course you don't owe her anything.

Thats a hard NTA.", "If this happened when they were children, she could have filed for a modification of child support, at which time they'd examine both of your incomes, your parenting time, etc. But they're in their 20s.

You don't owe her anything. She really shouldn't even have been calling for that. \n\nNow, you could have maybe been slightly more polite and just said you had started a different financial oppurtunity recently and this was new money, but how you make now that the kids are grown really isn't her issue. \n\nIf she does want you to give her more from back then, maybe she need to pay 50% of the grab school costs?

If you indeed earned the same amount until the kids were 18, and had the children an equal number of days during the week, and both of you split their necessities (school costs, clothes, healthcare, sports fees) evenly, then this sounds like a fair split. Her and her husband wanting to splash out extra for a trip to Italy or to buy the children fancy new cars when they turned 16 is not a necessity. That's on them if they want to spend their money that way.\n\nHowever this sentence gives me pause if it refers to day to day child expenses, not just trips to Italy:\n\n>**I contributed as much as I could then the ex covered the rest.**\n\nThis is not how child support works, and if you had a child support order enforced by the court, perhaps you would have been required to pay more. So if she had to pay all the school fees, sports fees, health insurance, clothes, braces, and then the day they turned 18, you miraculously came into money... then no, I don't think you need to pay HER a cent, but just like you are paying for your daughter's grad school, you might want to be generous when it comes time to pay for weddings or help with down payments and then make sure your kids know that this is team effort and that mom was the one paying for things when they were growing up.", "Omfg. There are so many idiots that don't know shit about child support.  Nta, but you might get your ass handed to you by a court.  Every state has their own laws on child support.  Even if you two had a written agreement, if it wasn't through the courts, they can still throw it out.  \nLook up your local laws and ask a lawyer. The court can deem you need to pay child support for the entire time possibly.  And it'll all be due in 5 days or less most of the time.  How they pro rate how much and at one time also depends all on the judge and lawyers.  Some have formulas, some don't, and even then, they can add on to that number.  \nSo sure, you don't and shouldn't, but when it comes to kids, the courts are rigged against men. So CYA.", "If it's court ordered that you owe her money then yes, YTA but if there's no court order then I guess you got lucky in having an ex wife who could give your kids a better life than you could.", "NTA.\n\nChild support is wrong.", "I reckon the OPs ex is convinced that he was hiding his income until the children aged out of child support. \nI wonder if she\u2019s right. \nOP could easily be the AH.", "Info: did you tell her you were no longer at your job, hadn't been since 2020, and the business you and your brother started is what's allowing you to be more generous now? \n\nIf you haven't talked to her for years I can understand her being suspicious that you were not contributing more when you could have when the kids were young, but demanding back \"child support\" at this point is still off the wall.", "Potentially YTA - this is highly dependent on if you are in the USA and what state you live in.  If you don\u2019t live in the USA or your state has different rules, ignore this and figure out what your laws are for this.  You didn\u2019t tell her your salary changed.  I highly suggest you find out when your salary became greater than hers and when your children aged out of child support.  Talk with a lawyer about what the formula in your state is for child support and work with an accountant to make sure that any back child support is corrected.  She most likely will easily win that amount in court, no use in wasting a ton of money on lawyers to pay what is legally due to her based on the formula.  You may have met that with what you gave her already, but you need to make sure you have that covered.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To see her get upset over the money she spent on HER CHILDREN is ridiculous. \n\nIMO this sounds like the ex wants money for HERSELF, I feel like she wants the old trips paid by OP but still wants the credit for taking the kids on the trip\u2026", "Yeah why would OP need to help fund a vacation his ex and her new partner decided to go on????", "The kids might have been made worse so spending extra on them and giving them luxuries that they did not EARN through their own labor.", "And in more than a few places even if there was 50/50 custody the ex may have had to pay child support to OP to try and equalize the standard of living in both homes.", "He said shared custody but didn\u2019t specify 50/50.

Formulas are usually auto set for what child support is due to the other parent based on salary and custody share.  It\u2019s up to them to keep track of that formula for themselves.

He gave what he could afford for extras like a trip to Italy and new cars. That indeed is not how child support works, he didn't need to give anything to facilitate their vacations.

He didn't owe her funding a trip to Italy and new cars for the kids, that was her choice to spend her money.", "This is not how it works.  You can't retroactively ask for money for all those years ago.

New drivers should NEVER have a new car.", "Good point", "Because he had them 50% of the time, he was paying their everyday expenses directly.  For example, he paid for half their food at the grocery store, he did not have to pay the mother child support for food. He had already paid for their food.", "From what I understood, they were each paying for daily expenses and he contributed with whatever he could on the other expenses. I don't get the 1000 for the trips because a family trip (his exs family trip more exactly) doesn't seem like something he should contribute to. The car expense on the other hand is. I would be curious though how much was the car, because 5000 dollars is a lot already (I have 2 cars that put together don't cost that much) and it depends what the ex paid. If she wanted to buy more extravagant stuff (like a 20000 dollars car) and he only could afford 5000 of it, then he doesn't owe her now the rest 5000 dollars that would have been what's misding from paying half. I mean if his ex chose to have a more expensive lifestyle together with her children, he shouldn't have to support half of that if he could not afford it at the time. Alimony is usually established by the earnings at that point, so even if they had a legal sum established, he shouldn't have to pay retroactively anything now, as his salary increased, since his children are already adults.", "So, should the ex have been paying for things during the 50% of the time OP had them? You\u2019re trying to imply the mom is a good woman bc she paid for an Italy trip and cars, but she was skipping out on day to day expenses, which she should have been paying.\n\nDo you hear how utterly stupid you sound when you swap the genders? They paid equally for things during their EQUAL parenting time. They earned the same amount of money. 6k EACH for extras that the mom wanted (new drivers don\u2019t need 10k+ cars as starter cars, and mom\u2019s vacation on mom\u2019s time is mom\u2019s responsibility to pay for.)", "I think those are just examples and he was still paying half of grocery costs, school supplies etc because custody was 50/50", "If anything she owes him money. Why on earth would he be responsible for 1K for his each of his kids to go to Italy with her and her new husband. Also 5K for each car that she got to pick out for the kids. He was much more generous to his ex then I would have been. I doubt she helped him pay to take the kids on vacation.", "I agree. Why should he pay for any of his kids vacations with their mother.  If he felt that 5k was a reasonable amount for a kids car then that\u2019s all he should contribute, regardless of how much money he had. His ex should be happy that his paying grad school and stop being greedy.", ">it doesn\u2019t matter how much money he was making as he was paying half\n\nIt doesn't sound like it actually applies to the OP, but that's not really how child support works. If one parent earns significantly more than the other then the higher earner is expected to contribute more, regardless of 50/50 custody. It's why celebrity divorces always have such eye watering numbers.", "I said he needs to check when they aged out vs his increase of salary.  I don\u2019t know the details of when they aged out and when his salary increased.  Beginning of pandemic was over 3 years ago and some states have support over 18.  He just said they are over 20 for the kids.  He could owe some, impossible to say, he needs to verify he is in the clear with people who know the rules on where he lives at.", "Here in Brazil, if an young adult is strictly in education, they may receive support up to 24 yo.", "He was only ever morally (and legally if they had a legal order) obliged to let her know when the kids were minors/supported by their parents.

Especially one that is only 3 years old since it was made during the Pandemic.\n\nThe fact that she immediately assumed he was hiding money and still working the same career at the time of divorce shows he hasn't kept her in the loop because it wasn't relevant to her.", "Doesn\u2019t matter if he was. He paid his share already anyways.", "> For all she knows he could have been withholding cash\n\nSure, but he knows for sure that she was. Her income increased when she remarried. Her only recourse now would be to go to court. But that would be a FAFO situation since the court could easily decide *she* owes back child support, if they did anything at all", "Depending on state of course, but most have a formula based on salary and custody share that you need to keep track of to make sure you are paying the correct amount.  It\u2019s not up to the lawyers or court to keep track of, it\u2019s on you.  If the other party finds out you aren\u2019t meeting that formula or lied about it, they can sue and easily win back child support for years where this person was making more than the other person.  This formula is usually auto set, you don\u2019t make divorce agreements on it, it\u2019s just automatic that is what you need to meet.  If you are 50/50 with same salary, it would be 0.  It obviously changed here at some point.\n\nIt would just be back paid to when he started making more than her to when they aged out of child support.  I know at least 1 state goes to 19.  He would only be on the hook for the formula percent, not what she thinks is his share.", "Many courts will deem what he was paying all along as a \"gift\" and then order him to pay back child support going back to the date of birth.", "Doesn\u2019t have to be. She can go back and ask for it retroactive.", "It also depends on when OP's income changed. He states his youngest is in grad school, so they're at least 21-22, possibly older. If OP's income didn't significantly increase until after the youngest was 18, there's no chance of OP's current income level being a factor for back child support.", "Yeah it could go the other way if she made more. I was just speaking in general terms about how it works.", "Really? That\u2019s surprising. In a lot of cases they have a handshake agreement but the guy never pays or stops paying or whatever so she\u2019ll take to court.", "If it\u2019s a formula state, it\u2019s all predetermined, that\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to check what the formula is for their salaries and when they aged out.

If it was deliberate, then that could be the only thing I would consider giving him a bit of AH ruling for it.  Court definitely wouldn\u2019t be happy about it.", "Depends on state, my state puts the requirement on the payer to keep up with the formula and pay the correct amount.  If the payee finds out later the payer hadn\u2019t being paying the correct amount and got increases of salary that went unreported, they can get back pay based on the formula.  Basically you have to submit all income from both parties and they will determine everything off a formula that weighs custody share and income difference.  Can be back dated.", "Guy admitted he never informed his ex of salary increases.   If that was while they were still eligible for child support, no way she gets laughed out of any court.  Not enough info to determine if they were eligible.", "The youngest is in grad school.\n\nUnless he\u2019s been making this type of income for 4+ years there\u2019s no back money.", "Since they never had child support, he wouldn't owe anything. They agreed to 50% custody and neither paid child support.", "In the US, court-ordered child support usually ends at 18 or the end of high school.", "Also depends on the state how long you can go back.  In my state is only 3 years unless there is public assistance involved.", "But I don't know of any state (in the US anyways) that allow you assess child support once the children are adults.  If the child were minors, sure you might be able to request some back child support.  But here it sounds like the kids are adults.", "In Michigan, unless it has changed, it is up to one of the parties to ask for a review.  The Friend of the Court will check once every 3 years I think.  My ex never asked for a review because she was making a little more.  Which I was fine with because my salary did increase.  I was already paying the max child support plus alimony.", "WTF?!

And it's limited to 3-5 years from the date of filing (depending on why it's being ordered). None of that would apply here, but might in the you're describing.", "You keep assuming it is a handshake agreement.

He may have not kept up income differences when they were still eligible.  Some states do allow backpay.", "Yes, that\u2019s true, he could.

You could have 50/50 and one of the parties pays child support, likely the one with more money which wasn\u2019t him.

Then no. \nThe key question is his income along with his children\u2019s ages. \nIn the us child support typically ends at 18 unless there\u2019s agreements to continue after, which doesn\u2019t seem the case here."]}
