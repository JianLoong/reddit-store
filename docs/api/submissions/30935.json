Being from Germany, the number one nation of Sitzpinklers, my initial thought was very much YATA. Most Germans only ever pee standing in public bathrooms. I would feel insulted if a friend of mine refused to sit down in my bathroom. Also its unhygienic and I wouldn't feel comfortable on my toilet (public bathroom). \n\nAnyway, my initial thought was YATA, but different cultures, different social norms. Idk :D", "While I do think that one should pee as they like, I believe this should only happen as long as it does not cause REAL issue to others.\n\nWhile we clean up after ourselves, we may miss a spot sometimes. Fact is, peeing standing up splashes. \n\nI myself was confronted with a similar paradigm a few years back and have since peed sitting down (except where the seat is dirty). To be honest, it made me realize how much people who went before me, who thought they were \"cleaning up\", left behind.\n\nWhoever tells you that sitting down emasculates you thinks that you are less of a man for daring to do different than most men. I believe the contrary.\n\nHowever, do as you please so long as you are respectful and actually make sure you clean up. My experience tells me that there is no disadvantage to sitting down.", "Huh?

You might miss some sometimes that splatters, and if their household is an only sitting down household now you've gotten your piss on them, even if you say you are good about it.  Also if everyone peed sitting down the great seat up seat down debate would be settled finally.  I am a guy, I pee sitting down, make it normal.

Now I find standing to pee disgusting because no matter how clean you think you are, you're getting pee all over your bathroom floor and under the toilet hinges.

Or why would I want my dick covered in bleach?  And yep, this concern does make shitting an issue sometimes\u2026one has to have processes.", "What if people have dirty but cheeks though? What if they wipe they\u2019re ads then touch a but cheek before washing their hands, so the next toilet they sit down on has shit particles. I don\u2019t think I agree with you all about it being more hygienic to be honest!", "They don\u2019t have to get wet to touch the seat, the rim etc. Why is that acceptable?", "There's no vote. It's just the top comment", "NTA but if you ever have to clean up pee splash anywhere, maybe consider that as a hint to sit when you pee. It's a hands-free experience. No mess. No splash. No spills.", "I learned this just from having to clean the bathrooms every week growing up. Imagine a house with three or four males! I very quickly learned to wipe down before going and to always sit while peeing. It's also why we require our guests to sit while peeing. We've never gotten pushback from any of them, either.\n\nSo, really, the judgment should be YTA.", "Did you read my comment or just say fuck it after the first sentence?", "No, where you live that's rude. Where I come from it isn't. And that's also where op is from. Cultural difference.", "As long as I have to clean the bathroom my guests sit. If they wanna stand they can pee outside.", "Exactly!! I can\u2019t believe most people In here think, sitting is more hygienic. It baffles me to be honest", "You gotta sit on it to poop anyways. And women have to sit on it regardless. So if the seat isn't clean then everyone has problems anyways.\n\nPeeing while standing is less hygienic for everyone else since you're probably getting some amount of pee on other surfaces (but may be more hygienic for the person peeing since you don't have to touch anything).", "Surprise! You are not the person in this world and there is \u201cin fact\u201d cultures where this is normal. I personally come from a country where guys sitting down is unheard of. Completely. Never heard of it. Actually I even believe is not common for guys to wipe after peeing, I did it cause I always thought it was nasty not to but I have never heard anybody do it. So no, is not standard for everybody. It depends on culture and people and it should be respected once known.", "5 guys never stand when they pee in other people's houses?\n\nMisschien hebben ze dit onderwerp al eens eerder besproken, anders is dit de toiletversie van overdreven politieke correctheid.", "Who doesn\u2019t like a little break during the day? I don\u2019t have a penis so sadly am resigned to sitting, but my partner tells me that they started sitting when they realized that a) it makes much less mess, so no clean up time for them and b) they get to *sit down*. I\u2019m all for men sitting, have a little rest and make sure you flush with the lid down.", "Call me pedantic, but comparing standing vs sitting, sitting takes longer. You gotta undo you pants, pull down you underwear and pants and then pull \u2018em when done. \n\nVs\n\nSitting, where you just undo the zipper, pull it out and go, then stuff it back in.", ">NL toilets are (usually) very low and the bowl have a weird shape so it splashes a lot more than \"common\" toilets\n\nEh, I wish they usually were, but it's just random. In my experience, modern Dutch toilets are often high, because Dutch people are tall.\n\nI assume the toilet shape you're referring to is the one with the shelf? It's a classic design that imo splashes far less, especially compared to when you drop a shell in the toilet and the toilet returns fire and soaks your bottom\u2026", "Exacerbated by the fact that they\u2019re all tall as fuck", "Just fyi, it\u2019s kinda weird to assume cultural expectations are the same as in the US. I get that you just wanted to contribute but how do you know it\u2019s not an expectation halfway across the world?", "Fuck that. I put the lid AND seat down in my house, everyone has to raise and lower that shit. Women don't get special exceptions in my house.", "How exactly do you police that?", "You require your guests to use the bathroom like you want? That\u2019s fucking weird gtf out of ppls private business ya fuckin goof.", "Nah I read the whole thing and my comment still stands, just because it looks clean doesn\u2019t mean it is.", "Why can\u2019t people understand this", "Completely agree. I hate when people stand and piss. My bathroom is not a urinal.", "Me either", "Except it's standard where op is from.", "I have no proof, but I'd argue c: you empty your bladder more which means less trips to the bathroom", "this isn't a speedrun", "It depends how much time you have to spend wiping up your pee - particularly if you have to wipe the floor, which is extra time consuming.", "But with sitting you can take a few extra seconds to let that last little bit dribble out. Just my preference.\n\nAlso, ZERO sitting in public toilets. They're almost always nasty.", "Low blow, low blow.", "> Dutch toilets are often high, because Dutch people are tall\n\nI guess I'm bringing a stepping stool if I ever travel to Dutch places lol", ">when you drop a shell in the toilet\n\n*Nobody* knows how to use the three seashells.", "I'm a woman living alone and I always lower both. It's unhygienic to flush a toilet with the lid up, *especially* when there are bath towels, tooth brushes, face cloths, and make-up brushes all in the same room in the general vicinity of the toilet. There's always particles being kicked up even if you can't see it", "To be fair, they're basically talking about sitting down being considerate of those who clean the bathroom. Seems pretty reasonable to me.", "Aw man, that makes a lot of sense! I was wondering why people didn't have many helpful responses!", "Yes it does. I\u2019m not going to get anything nasty on my bum if it looks clean and you aren\u2019t gonna contract anything from a toilet seat. There\u2019s no risk and you aren\u2019t splashing piss everywhere", "I really don't know! In some cultures you don't wear shoes indoors. You'd be an asshole to do it anyway. I see this as the same. \n\nI wonder why so many men get so defensive or offended because they're asked 'to pee like a girl'.", "Saying you can't tell the difference. I've cleaned toilets (and especially the floors) and yes, you can. even though you might not see it the once, it builds up.\n\nApparently most men who are asked to sit down, spontaneously grow a vagina \ud83d\ude02", "If you would have read the comment I've replied to, you would know that that's not the issue for OP. And most other people neither, for that matter.", "True, but I like to be efficient with my time.", "Wiping the toilet bowl rim takes a second or two and as long you hit the right spot in the bowl, you don\u2019t get any on the floor.", "No, low bowl, low bowl \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Even with the lid down it doesn't really stop the particles getting on everything. But it doesn't hurt to just lower the lid before flushing anyway.", "This is exactly it. There's a reason why you shouldn't keep a toothbrush near a toilet. I got downvoted for saying I'm not your cleaner. In the Netherlands it's completely normal to sit down to pee for men, as you can see by the reaction of his friends. It's mostly the older generation who insist on standing, usually the reason is because they have a penis. Eh, okay?", "Are you sure? Most of the really nasty stuff can\u2019t be seen. What if the person before you was wiping their shit and then put their hand on the toilet seat or brushed it on an ass check before washing their hands? Could be all sorts of bacteria on their, also what if your dick touched the inside of the bowl where people have pissed a thousand times? What if someone pulled the toilet paper up to see if there was any shit left on it and dropped it on the toilet seat but only cleaned it off with water? Could definitely be some nasty bacteria left over!\n\nLike I said, I\u2019m not so sure man.", "I read it, it still doesnt change the fact that your dick and balls touch both the bowl and the water. Which you would know if you had a dick or balls. I'm not even well hung and my dick touches the bowl.", "You do. You just don't see it.", "Unless you have open sores on your ass cheeks, you\u2019ll live. I\u2019d rather not smell piss in my bathroom so extend that courtesy to my clean friends.", "How do take a dump then?", "Sure, okay then.\n\nSo, tell me, what's easier: wiping off your dick or wiping AN ENTIRE ROOM?", "If you're getting piss in the shower, that's on you. For your stance on this you sure as fuck better flush with the toilet lid down, or you're just as bad as every guy who stands to piss.\n\nObviously whipping your dick is easier, that does not however change both the facts that the bacteria in a toilet bowl can cause a UTI or that it's easier to clean AN ENTIRE FUCKING ROOM than it is to clean your balls every time you take a piss.\n\nCause at that point you may as well just piss in the shower while your cleaning them anyways every time you need to piss.", "Come to my house. My mother in law gets more pee all over the place than my bf ever has, including getting it on the floor. And she never cleans it up. Sometimes I wonder if she stands or tries to pee like a male dog based on the mess left behind."]}
