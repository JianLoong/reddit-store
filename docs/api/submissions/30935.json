Being from Germany, the number one nation of Sitzpinklers, my initial thought was very much YATA. Most Germans only ever pee standing in public bathrooms. I would feel insulted if a friend of mine refused to sit down in my bathroom. Also its unhygienic and I wouldn't feel comfortable on my toilet (public bathroom). \n\nAnyway, my initial thought was YATA, but different cultures, different social norms. Idk :D", "While I do think that one should pee as they like, I believe this should only happen as long as it does not cause REAL issue to others.\n\nWhile we clean up after ourselves, we may miss a spot sometimes. Fact is, peeing standing up splashes. \n\nI myself was confronted with a similar paradigm a few years back and have since peed sitting down (except where the seat is dirty). To be honest, it made me realize how much people who went before me, who thought they were \"cleaning up\", left behind.\n\nWhoever tells you that sitting down emasculates you thinks that you are less of a man for daring to do different than most men. I believe the contrary.\n\nHowever, do as you please so long as you are respectful and actually make sure you clean up. My experience tells me that there is no disadvantage to sitting down.", "Huh? NTA, obviously, but I'm wondering where you live where you'd get this reaction from people for doing something completely normal.", "Do you also check the floor for splashes and wipe it if necessary?", "Do you pull the toilet seat up?", "INFO:\n\n> wipe the seat\n\nYou're not putting the seat up?", ">I'm quite hygienic, and told them I always wipe my genitals after\n\nINFO, like you dab the tip with toilet paper or are you wiping your balls? No trying to be a jerk but for some reason this one threw me lol", "YTA. In some countries this is completely normal as peeing standing up is more unhygienic than sitting down. In the Netherlands it's indeed an expectation for most.\n\nWhatever you think of it, it's just common courtesy to be a good guest and peeing sitting down really isn't a lot to ask.", "I won't give a judgement because I'm not sure what's the norm in the Netherlands, but in Italy *always* sit down what you're at some else's place. The only exception is public toilets. My reaction to this would be \"eww\" too, but I won't call you TA because of different social norms.", "It is unhygienic technically. I sit at home and stand for public restrooms. If its a friends house and the toilet is clean I will sit. I'm from the US and idgaf what other guys think about it.", "soft YTA, it's a strange request but their house their rules", "NTA. I have never heard of this as a rule. It's standard where I'm from for penis-havers to lift up the toilet seat and stand up while peeing. Generally, only vagina-havers sit down while peeing but I know this is not 100% universal for either plumbing type. \n\nThough, if you leave the toilet seat down and stand to pee, that's gross and bad manners.", "Kind of a piss-poor attitude from your friends. Unless you're spinning around wildly and leaving a mess everywhere, I just don't see what's unhygienic about standing while peeing.\n\nNTA. Tell them to piss up a rope.", "I\u2019m not sure I understand. Do they have a problem with you sitting down to pee, or standing up? Either way it seems like a strange thing to have strong feelings about!\n\nNTA. When I have guests they can do what they want in my bathroom, as long as I don\u2019t have to clean up after them.", "NTA. Peeing standing up is totally normal for guys. Are your friends girls or something?", "NAH, but your friends have a point.  Peeing standing up is unhygienic, no debating which of the two is the cleanlier option.  You might miss some sometimes that splatters, and if their household is an only sitting down household now you've gotten your piss on them, even if you say you are good about it.  Also if everyone peed sitting down the great seat up seat down debate would be settled finally.  I am a guy, I pee sitting down, make it normal.  I only pee standing when I'm out in the woods and there isn't a toilet.", "Idk if there is some new-wave thinking that dudes can't pee standing up anymore outside their home throne, but if your friends think that peeing sitting down is the only way it should be done then they should bolt their toilet seat down and it will be obvious that you can't lift it up to pee standing up.\n\nY'all must be kids to have so little knowledge of how a toilet works that it's somehow bad manners to use a toilet the way it was designed.\n\nNTA", "NTA. WTF is happening right now, people really believe they have the right to tell you how to use a toilet because you're in their house and that it's \"respect\" or \"manners.\" This is absolutely nonsense. If you clean up and are respectful to the point that they never would have known, then who gives a shit. This is some high brown bullshit. \n\nFor reference: I exclusively sit while I pee. (and stand while I shit).", "NTA", "I do think it is strange for them to expect you to sit down, however if it is their place, you should follow their rules, whether you like that or not, so I do think you should go sit down. Even if that is weird", "Urinals are for standing, toilets are for sitting. I do not understand why men are so weird about this. Y'all splash, and you don't clean nearly as well as you say you do. I can always tell when my boys have decided not to sit. None of you have d**ks long enough to worry about them getting wet from sitting.", "NTA. They shouldn't care and it's pretty weird that they do", "YTA. Dude, it's THEIR house. Major AH", "TDIL that other countries sit when they pee. Interesting.", "Your parents raised you poorly imo and should be ashamed of themselves. As should you", "NTA probably like 99% of us men pee standing up\u2026 you haven\u2019t done anything wrong", "YTA.\n\n Learning manners doesn\u2019t stop just because you are 22.", "NTA\n\nI don't know any man who sits to pee.  Is this a new thing? Maybe a cultural thing?", "NTA. Don't sit down for nobody.", "Nah\n\nWhat you are doing it's completely normal. \n\nIt's their home, so their rules are *the* rules, as weird as the rules are in this situation. You are welcome to not go to their home, or just not use the bathroom while you're there.", "NTA.

Unless someone\u2019s bathroom habits are having a tangible hygiene impact on others, I don\u2019t think they should be judged.

Second of all, I raised four boys, no matter how much you clean up after yourselves, pee splashes on the floor and it also gets underneath the hinges of the toilet seat. If you were to take your seat off, you'd see how disgusting it is. I was an exchange student in Germany as a teenager, and virtually everybody in Germany sits down to pee. I realize then that it's much much better. Particularly as an older man, and particularly at night. Now I find standing to pee disgusting because no matter how clean you think you are, you're getting pee all over your bathroom floor and under the toilet hinges. Just because you're used to something, doesn't mean it's the best way. American men somehow turn this into some kind of macho bullshit thing, instead of just simple expediency and cleanliness", "What's wrong about it?", "It's just dirty as hell. You won't see it obviously, but droplets of piss will be everywhere", "As a man who prefers to stand up, you're full of shit and it has nothing to do with that. This toxic masculinity nonsense doesn't help anyone and I'll happily downvote an opinion as dumb as that.\n\nThat having been said, OP is also NTA, unless he's been leaving a huge mess or something.", ">Go ahead downvote me.\n\nNo problem. Anyone who espouses this kind of dumb \"attack of masculinity\" bullshit deserves to be downvoted.\n\nWhile I usually stand to pee in my own home where I live alone, it is absolutely more hygienic to sit down. A fairly substantial percentage of men realize that and normally pee sitting down. More than 1/3 of younger men in the US normally pee sitting down, and statistics also show that around 20% of American men 55 and older sit down to pee. It's definitely not some new thing and has nothing to do with trying to emasculate men.", "Is this why the Netherlands are part of the low countries?", "Actually splashes a lot less with the platform. I miss Dutch toilets.", "Oh I do. This is an expectation. There's absolutely no reason for a man visiting my house to stand up.

You can see this if you fill a kettle with water dyed with a bright dye and pour it into the toilet.", "I don't understand how every answer like this gets downvoted? \nSitting down is more hygienic, and it helps empty the bladder. I don't understand why people get so offended when asked not to spray their (invisible droplets of) pee in someone's bathroom?

It would be messy though, since I have no aim with my anatomy.", "sorry you don't have a dick. i will never pee sitting down", "A pee stream out of a penis is not similar to dumping a kettle into the toilet.", "I don't understand either!

It's just a fact. In many countries it's the norm.
