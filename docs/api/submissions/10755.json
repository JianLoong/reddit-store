Reminder to not have lilies in your home with a cat or make sure they are in an cat unreachable place + hand washing after care. \n\n----------------\n\nObvious throwaway but more so because I don't want the cats subreddit to eat me alive.\n\nWe have three cats, absolutely handsome boys who we love dearly. Given this, I rarely bring lilies home and when I do, it's always gifts from my mother. I miss her a lot and she's given my lilies since I was a kid - they hold a lot of sentimental value. We recently purchased a home and I always keep them locked in my office and do not allow the cats in until they've died and I've had a chance to deep clean and press them with the notes my mother sends me. It's a hassle ensuring that there is 0 contact, meaning I rarely have them in my household for the cats safety. \n\nGiven that they're my favorite plant and have such sentimental value, but we want to be safe with our cats, our garden is decked in them. We do not have lilies that are big pollen producers, if anyone is worried about that, lots of research has gone into that to ensure we aren't covered in pollen coming inside. However, they cannot be eaten by cats. \n\nHere's the AITA - I warned my neighbors that we have lilies in our garden. Several of our neighbors have cats and we gave them a heads up and the date in which the garden construction would begin. Nobody protested and thanked us for warning them, some did not know about lily toxicity. We have a large privacy fence as we have a Doberman as well, so it's not an easy backyard to get into to begin with. \n\nI came home from work two weeks ago and heard howling in the backyard. One of the neighbors cats had managed to get into our yard and absolutely went to town on our flower bed. I didn't recognize the cat but threw it in a carrier and headed to the vet. Once he was there, I checked with the neighbors to see who's cat it was. \n\nThe cat belonged to someone we had talked to. She screamed at me over allowing her cat to eat the plants, but I just took her to the vet. High stress, no big deal. However, a last week, she started an argument as I was walking the dog. It initially started with me asking how the cat was doing (dumb mistake), and escalated into her calling me a cat killer. I ended up exchanging nasty comments about how she should keep her animals on her property. \n\nToday, I found a letter detailing her vet bill and her demanding to pay it. My husband wanted to just throw it away, but at this point I'm so angry. We have a fenced in private yard, I let the neighbors know in advance, and she didn't even know where her cat was. She's lucky my dog wasn't out. \n\nAnyhow, AITA? I really don't want to rip up the plants because outside of the only place we can have them to keep our cats safe.

I'm sure OP would have been a bit disconcerted if this person hopped their fence into the garden at random and just used the excuse of \"gotta get my cat\" because anyone could use that line and it's a bit of a breach of personal space.\n\nThis is a tricky situation all around", "\u2026YOU KEEP THEM IN YOUR HOUSE. \n\nVery simple solution. \n\nUnless its a barn cat, it has zero business being outside your home. Keep it inside or dont own one.\n\nThere are loads of items on the market that are dangerous and stupid. Just because its sold on the market it doesnt mean its a good idea to use them.", "[removed]", "So I've looked and cats right to roam is actually protected in law;\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.rspca.org.uk/documents/1494939/7712578/CAT_adviceondeterringcats.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiNhazp5az9AhVKUMAKHa2tDnwQFnoECAwQBg&usg=AOvVaw1LS3PHp8ZR8Afydk6vz7QO\n\nI would argue keeping a cat, an animal that naturally roams, inside is crueler than letting it out. And again, if cats either are meant to be kept inside or in barns why did they invent cat flaps specifically to let cats get outside?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

But theres no evidence OP is in the UK. \n\nThey invented cat flaps so lazy owners didnt have to keep getting up and opening the door. It doesnt prove anything other than even less responsibility from the pet owner.", "No, no idea where OP is, but the animal is the and either way same either way and I'm just trying to demonstrate that cats being allowed outside is the norm. Trying to dismiss the as irresponsible is odd. And FYI cat flaps are so the cat can come and go as it pleases; if you open the door to let your cat out then have to go to work or something how is the cat meant to get back in when you're not home otherwise!?", "As i said\u2026its so nobody has to be there to open the door. It still doesnt make it a good invention."]}
