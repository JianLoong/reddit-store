Reminder to not have lilies in your home with a cat or make sure they are in an cat unreachable place + hand washing after care. \n\n----------------\n\nObvious throwaway but more so because I don't want the cats subreddit to eat me alive.\n\nWe have three cats, absolutely handsome boys who we love dearly. Given this, I rarely bring lilies home and when I do, it's always gifts from my mother. I miss her a lot and she's given my lilies since I was a kid - they hold a lot of sentimental value. We recently purchased a home and I always keep them locked in my office and do not allow the cats in until they've died and I've had a chance to deep clean and press them with the notes my mother sends me. It's a hassle ensuring that there is 0 contact, meaning I rarely have them in my household for the cats safety. \n\nGiven that they're my favorite plant and have such sentimental value, but we want to be safe with our cats, our garden is decked in them. We do not have lilies that are big pollen producers, if anyone is worried about that, lots of research has gone into that to ensure we aren't covered in pollen coming inside. However, they cannot be eaten by cats. \n\nHere's the AITA - I warned my neighbors that we have lilies in our garden. Several of our neighbors have cats and we gave them a heads up and the date in which the garden construction would begin. Nobody protested and thanked us for warning them, some did not know about lily toxicity. We have a large privacy fence as we have a Doberman as well, so it's not an easy backyard to get into to begin with. \n\nI came home from work two weeks ago and heard howling in the backyard. One of the neighbors cats had managed to get into our yard and absolutely went to town on our flower bed. I didn't recognize the cat but threw it in a carrier and headed to the vet. Once he was there, I checked with the neighbors to see who's cat it was. \n\nThe cat belonged to someone we had talked to. She screamed at me over allowing her cat to eat the plants, but I just took her to the vet. High stress, no big deal. However, a last week, she started an argument as I was walking the dog. It initially started with me asking how the cat was doing (dumb mistake), and escalated into her calling me a cat killer. I ended up exchanging nasty comments about how she should keep her animals on her property. \n\nToday, I found a letter detailing her vet bill and her demanding to pay it. My husband wanted to just throw it away, but at this point I'm so angry. We have a fenced in private yard, I let the neighbors know in advance, and she didn't even know where her cat was. She's lucky my dog wasn't out. \n\nAnyhow, AITA? I really don't want to rip up the plants because outside of the only place we can have them to keep our cats safe. They have so much sentimental value, but I also know that people let their cats out regardless.\n\nEDIT: there's a lot of confusion on the cats status. the cat survived, she just called me a cat killer because kidney failure is no joke. i am not sure on his current health status but have seen him outside since, so i know he's at least up to kitty cat business still.", "created_utc": 1677193035, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11abgcr/aita_for_refusing_to_remove_my_plants_after_it/", "score": 636, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
