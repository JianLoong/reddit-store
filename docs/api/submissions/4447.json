My half-sister Carrie (F36) has only known this for about a year. They were all very supportive, but I have a grandmother who is a very conservative baptist. Neither I nor my parents are religious.\n\nToday I found out from my mom that Carrie accidentally outed me to my grandmother. I had honestly intended on never coming out to her, as I was pretty sure I knew what her response would be. All I know right now about her actual response is that she wanted to know if we had prayed on it and that she is concerned about my soul. \n\nThis resulted in my conservative aunt and uncle also being told about my sexuality, but they were luckily very supportive.\n\nCarrie had originally planned on telling me about what she had done herself after Christmas, but my mom felt more comfortable telling me once I finished with my finals so that I would be prepared and decide what I felt comfortable doing.\n\nI wasn't mad at Carrie, I do believe it was an accident, and I told her this over text. However, I also told her that I don't feel comfortable attending her Christmas Eve dinner because my grandmother will be there. Carrie has stated that it will be a small family gathering (me and my parents, her, and my grandmother) and that it wouldn't be the same without me there. I told her again that I just didn't feel comfortable with it. My mom and I are very close (Carrie is not her daughter) and are essentially a package deal. I let Carrie know that if I didn't go then my mom would also not go, especially since she wouldn't want to leave me alone on Christmas Eve. Carrie's response was to ask, \"So now she's not coming either?\". I told her most likely not. I can tell that she is upset with me about this, and she hasn't responded to the last text I sent almost 4 hours ago.\n\nBoth Carrie and my dad have spoken to my grandmother and asked her not to say anything, but I feel like this is too big for her to not say something to me when she sees me next. She has always been very critical of me and my mom and has a history of being homophobic and racist.\n\nI don't want to ruin Carrie's event by being an asshole, but I also feel like all I am doing is trying to create boundaries and protect my mental health. I just don't want to be bombarded with questions and have my holiday ruined.\n\nWIBTA if I didn't go?", "created_utc": 1670738497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zihf4j/wibta_if_i_didnt_go_to_christmas_eve_dinner/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your not penalizing Carrie, your protecting yourself from a woman who has a history of being homophobic and racist. It\u2019s perfectly fair that you don\u2019t want to spend Christmas with her, especially now that she knows your a lesbian. Tell\nCarrie you love her and hope to see her over the holidays, but it\u2019s not good for your mental health and you won\u2019t compromise on that. Good luck", "NTA. Keep yourself safe from potential assholes targeting you for who you are. Find a different venue, something that's come-and-go, if you want to test the waters. Or if you're sure the waters are acidic, don't even bother.", "Carrie outed you. Everyone claims it was an accident. Then some other relatives who you didn't want to tell got wind? Hmmmm... not my first rodeo, and I'm skeptical. But either way, it's done. You're not kicking up a lot of drama about that. Mature. \n\nBut your boundary with your grandmother is understandable and must be respected. If Carrie is pressuring you about this? Carrie is not only THE asshole in this instance? She is AN asshole in perpetuity. NTA", "NTA you have every right to decide not to go, just as your mother does. Regardless of whether Carrie accidentally outed you to your grandmother or not, the fact is that she did and will now have to deal with the consequences and backlash of her actions. Don\u2019t let her overstep this boundary you\u2019re setting. \n\nYou don\u2019t feel comfortable going to a party that a woman who has been critical to you and homophobic in her past will be attending. That\u2019s certainly reason enough to stay away under normal circumstances, but now that she\u2019s learned of your sexual orientation, and have learned she wasn\u2019t very tolerant already, you\u2019re completely justified in staying home. \n\nYour mom is a competent woman to make her own decisions on where she wants to spend the evening. If that\u2019s with you, instead of Carrie\u2019s, then that\u2019s her decision to make. \n\nCarrie will learn a tough lesson in being more careful with things that aren\u2019t her business to share.  And perhaps they can use that time to discuss with your grandmother why her attitude and behavior is so wrong. \n\nI know you said you aren\u2019t religious, but you would be welcome in my church. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a lesbian. We welcome everyone. That\u2019s the way Christianity is intended be, and if your conservative Baptist grandmother hasn\u2019t learned that then she\u2019s ignoring the Bible teachings deliberately. Regardless, religion aside, there\u2019s no reason to be a shitty human being. \n\nStand your ground. NTA", "NTA, if your grandmother has a history of being critical to the point of having to be warned to keep quiet, then you may be right to be concerned about going. Your sister outed you but wasn't going to warn you about it beforehand? Sounds like she's more worried about her party being ruined than your mental health.", "Protecting yourself is reasonable.  If this woman has a history (she does) and has been asking questions about your soul why would you want to spend time with her?\nHonestly  if everyone stood up to homophobes and racists they would be the ones at home by themselves. \nA good Christian woman would know it's not her place to judge anyone but herself. \n\nRemember,  in her religion Jesus' best friends were outcasts and a prostitute. \n\nToo many \"religious\" people blame the Christian beliefs instead of owning up to the fact they are homophobic and racist.\n\nStay home with mom. Order pizza or something fun for dinner.  Watch a fun movie that you both love. \n\nYour half sister blew it. She can live with it. It may help her remember not to gossip (your grandmother should be angry with her). This time she told someone who is just critical. She could out someone who could be physically harmed too.", "Accidentally outing someone is a thing that should just never happen. It is too bad your sister made this \u201cmistake,\u201d but now she has to suffer the consequences for it. \n\nLuckily for her, those consequences include a single awkward celebration rather than potentially a lifetime of cut-off relations with a relative. She should suck it up and get over it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Good for you for protecting yourself. NTA", "NTA - Carrie told your \u201csecret\u201d, accident or not. Now she gets to accept how you respond. Your response is reasonable.", "NTA. You never ever have to go to a family dinner if you don\u2019t feel comfortable doing so. Carrie should be more understanding of your concerns about being around your racist and homophobic grandma. Stay home and have a relaxing, stress free time with your mom.", "NTA - While Carrie outed you by accident, she made a conscious decision to keep what had happened from you. That's not okay, even if she had good intentions (like not wanting to ruin your Christmas). You've been more than gracious.", "NTA. Why does it bother her so much of who you find attractive? Tell your gma to mind her own. \ud83d\ude06", "NTA.  You shouldn't have been outed and been allowed to choose how to tell people and when.  It is really unfortunate that your half-sister did that to you, accidental or not.  \n\nThat being said, I would consider that drawing out addressing it may make the reaction bigger.  Ask yourself if you want a relationship if your grandma and want to attend family gatherings.  If so, you may want to get ahead of it.  Call your grandma and talk to her, let her know what you expect as far as treatment.  Then talk to the rest of your family.  Talk to your sister about what you are concerned about with family events and what you would need to feel safe attending (mainly, that you don't want to be attacked).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is it possible that they would be supportive enough to shut gma down and rally around you in such a way that it is more of a triumph over bigotry? \n(Although it\u2019s not looking good if Carrie is upset with you and more worried about her party than about supporting you\u2026)", "NTA, you are not required to go to any particular event. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable going, don\u2019t go. Have you thought about having a pre-event meeting with your grandmother to see if she can be civil with you? People sometimes change their tune about things when the targets of their comments suddenly includes their own children or grandchildren.", "OP it's done, it's over with, and any \"damage\" has been done so it's not a matter putting blame on how things went.  The best option is how you feel moving forward, and if your mental health is saying to stay away then do it.  It's saved myself more peace of mind than you can image, and you need to protect yourself too.  Just ignore those people pushing you to satisfy their own curiosity to see what could potentially happen.  It's just one night.", "NTA. The sister put herself in this situation when she outed you, even if by mistake. You have kindly let her know, without any blame. Only thing is that I'd let your mother say she wouldn't go to the half sister, it makes relationships easier when we don't speak for eachother.", "How do you \u201caccidentally\u201d out someone?! NTA, OP. Your mental health is more important than an awkward family dinner. Holiday or not.", "NTA.\n\nYou do what is comfortable to you, and if your experience of your grandmother is someone who is homophobic and racist, and you are a lesbian, I would personally not go. \n\nI would, and if you are willing, however, keep the door open if you can for your grandmother to approach you at some point in the future. Maybe once your grandmother absorbs the meaning of you being a lesbian, she\u2019ll be a lot more understanding and open to hearing more about this newly-awakened part of you, and you can organise it in a way where you hold the power of the conversation. That is up to you if you think it\u2019s worth to give her a chance to try and understand the real you, and of course, this is only a suggestion for if your half sister and your parents come back and give a positive review of how your grandmother seems about it.\n\nBut, overall, in the here and now, not going to this Christmas Eve party is not just understandable, but something I\u2019d personally do too if I were in your shoes. I just hope that you don\u2019t feel lonely this Christmas, because you don\u2019t deserve to be alone; invite a friend or two over, or go to a friend\u2019s house for Christmas Eve, instead if you can \u2764\ufe0f", "This!  I suspect Carrie did it on purpose.", "Perpetuity- love that", "I was also thinking along these lines.  If dad talked to grandma call and see if it had any affect.

And if your sister really cared about you and wanted to fix her mistake, then she would ask the racist bigot to not come instead of forcing you to miss the dinner.", "NTA, but I do wonder if you're thinking it will be worse than it will. Everyone there except your grandma is supportive, and 'have you prayed about it' isn't the worst response ever (don't get me wrong, it's not good, but from a conservative grandma it could be worse). If the only reason you're not going is that you're worried your grandma will say something, would it not be better to just ask one of your family to have a chat with her in advance and ask her not to? and then if she takes it well you can go and see how it is.", "Yeah my first thought was she did it on purpose too. OP she knows your grandma, KNOWS she\u2019s homophobic. Like come on\u2026. She was *trying* to make drama. No one would ever go telling their homophobic family about their gay sister without being FULLY sure they knew. Edit: NTA"]}
