He asked if we could take my new car as that would give him and his wife a chance to see it and ride along in which I have ZERO issue with and would gladly agree to. However, I replied to his text and told him \u201cI don\u2019t want us to take the Urus as L (nephew) tends to make a mess like he did the last time in my car. Will you get him to behave or should we take your car?\u201d \n\nThis prompted my brother to get offended and insinuate that I was acting like a piece of entitled shit because I think i\u2019m \u201cdoing better than them so I look down upon their lives.\u201d NONE of this is true.

I use accidentally in quotations as I KNOW my nephew and how spoiled he is. My brother and his wife let him get away with anything at home, whether it\u2019s screaming tantrums or buying him whatever he points his finger to in a store.

Your brother is very entitled if he thinks it\u2019s ok to let his child do that to other people\u2019s stuff. I wouldn\u2019t let the kid in my car either and if I was your brother, I wouldn\u2019t even dare to suggest taking your new expensive car knowing that the kid might make a mess again.", "NTA. You know how he is and that your brother just brushes it off. If he's okay with the kid destroying his stuff then fine, but you don't have to be.", "NTA\n\nYour car, your rules. Nephew has proven himself to be a little monster, so it\u2019s reasonable to protect your expensive belongings.", "NTA. BUT, the reason your brother is mad is the way you phrased it and you are kind of an AH for that. Saying, \"Can you get him to behave?!\" implies a ton of judgement over their parenting style and a dislike of your nephew. That is why they're angry. A better way of approaching this would have been to say, \"Sure we could take my car, but I do have concerns about Nephew and messes (cite examples if needed), what can we do to make sure that doesn't happen?\" Voices your valid concern, keeps your sentiment to the issue at hand (and not all of his parenting), and offers up simple fixes that make everyone happy, like no food in the car, no messy toys, etc.", "NTA. your brother knows there is truth in your assessment of the kid, but doesn\u2019t want to own up to it. So he takes it out on you instead.", "NTA", "NTA do not back down.  He can be a passenger but tell him you have a blanket ban on all children after what happened not just your nephew.\n\nNo kid accidently draws on car seats - thats just horrific parenting.", "NTA. Nope. They want to ride in your new car? They parent their kid.", "NTA.\n\nyour new car, your new rules.\n\nbro & sil do not parent their child, he ruins / destroys something, who would pay for the repairs / cleaning? not them i guess. because FaMiLy. like the time he drew on your seats. the spilled juice i can almost excuse, maybe a sudden break to prevent an accident and there is the mess. but the drawings? nopedy nope. dealbreaker. big time.\n\nso use brothers car or drive alone. and hide your keys.\n\notherwise you wake up and the car is gone while bro, sil & nephew take a test drive with it...", " Nta. My kids never would've done that at 7", "NTA especially after the incidents described. I'd never let them kid in my cr again even with a tarp under them.", "I think the only way fault is the nephew. Kids over 6 show know how to treat things. Whether they're parents or the school teacher teach them.", "NTA for not wanting him in the car. YTA for the way you handled it. You know your nephew and your brother. You should of said no from the start without specifying the reason. We parents can get sensitive about our kids.", "NTA don't parent your child and reap the consequences.", "NTA.  The kid is 7.  They are not parenting him and letting him ruin other people\u2019s property and taking no responsibility whatsoever.  You don\u2019t have to let them ride the car but you are allowing it for them.  Don\u2019t let anyone think you\u2019re in the wrong here.  They need to shape up as parents.", "NTA.\n\nI wouldn't want a destructive child in my Lambo either .....", "This can't be real as there is no chance anyone would ever judge you to be the asshole here. It really looks like a sh\\*tpost saying, \"Look at how I can casually buy a $250K car.\"", "Stop calling, this his problem not yours. NTA", "ESH, there was a better way to handle this. \n\nYou're not giving them the car, you are gonna be in it all the time, so you can actually watch the child too. Give the child a tablet for 3 hours and you're done.\n\n7 year old spilling juice it's not the end of the world and not terrible behaviour, but if your so worried about your precious lambo you can always stop somewhere if he wants a drink...\n\nThey are entitled from what you're saying but it's hard to tell without hearing their side", "NTA - For dont let your nephew ruined your car again \nYTA - Because you dont handle well", "Absolutely. The issue is more with the brother than the nephew and the parenting styles. There are certain things I don\u2019t give my kids in the back of a car, juice and markers being on that list, and that\u2019s how you control that. Also the rule is to return in the condition you received it, if not better. \n\nGuilt free NTA OP, this is brother\u2019s own fault and lazy parenting coming back at him.", "I didn't know what a Urus was until you mentioned it. I will say that when I was first reading this, I thought that the kid must be a baby because keeping them entertained can sometimes cause a mess. Instead, this kid is 7! And, intentionally destructive and his parents don't do anything about it. Why would they give a kid markers and a juice box in a borrowed car?", "Why can't he pass judgement? Letting a child use markers in someone else's car is simply bad patenting.", "So, OP needs to be the driver and parent the kid?\n\nJust sounds like you're hating on the Lamborghini to be honest.\n\nThey should've taken better care of his property.  \n\nJuice spills can happen but a 7 year old with markers isn't an accident. That's a failure to parent and from the sound of it they didn't even clean it."]}
