You know how he is and that your brother just brushes it off. If he's okay with the kid destroying his stuff then fine, but you don't have to be.", "NTA\n\nYour car, your rules. Nephew has proven himself to be a little monster, so it\u2019s reasonable to protect your expensive belongings.", "NTA. BUT, the reason your brother is mad is the way you phrased it and you are kind of an AH for that. Saying, \"Can you get him to behave?!\" implies a ton of judgement over their parenting style and a dislike of your nephew. That is why they're angry. A better way of approaching this would have been to say, \"Sure we could take my car, but I do have concerns about Nephew and messes (cite examples if needed), what can we do to make sure that doesn't happen?\" Voices your valid concern, keeps your sentiment to the issue at hand (and not all of his parenting), and offers up simple fixes that make everyone happy, like no food in the car, no messy toys, etc.", "NTA. your brother knows there is truth in your assessment of the kid, but doesn\u2019t want to own up to it. So he takes it out on you instead.", "NTA", "NTA do not back down.

They are not parenting him and letting him ruin other people\u2019s property and taking no responsibility whatsoever.  You don\u2019t have to let them ride the car but you are allowing it for them.

The issue is more with the brother than the nephew and the parenting styles. There are certain things I don\u2019t give my kids in the back of a car, juice and markers being on that list, and that\u2019s how you control that. Also the rule is to return in the condition you received it, if not better. \n\nGuilt free NTA OP, this is brother\u2019s own fault and lazy parenting coming back at him.", "I didn't know what a Urus was until you mentioned it. I will say that when I was first reading this, I thought that the kid must be a baby because keeping them entertained can sometimes cause a mess. Instead, this kid is 7!

Letting a child use markers in someone else's car is simply bad patenting.", "So, OP needs to be the driver and parent the kid?\n\nJust sounds like you're hating on the Lamborghini to be honest.\n\nThey should've taken better care of his property.  \n\nJuice spills can happen but a 7 year old with markers isn't an accident. That's a failure to parent and from the sound of it they didn't even clean it.", "You let them borrow a previous car and they let him have markers and juice in the back seat?

You're not the one making drama, you were ending it by not giving him the opportunity to vandalize your vehicle. And you should see now, that if to try and placate him you give him your car to borrow, it will come back ruined entirely to spite you. If they were willing to fuck up your last car even without them holding any resentment, they absolutely will destroy this car given that you've told them very clearly that they are bad parents and asshole relations.\n\nStop calling him because you crawling to him is giving him power in the situation", "NTA. However, you still need to watch your car like a cat with one kitten. Your lovely little nevvy sounds like the kind of poisonous little dickwad that would key your car, throw rocks, etc. I wouldn\u2019t trust him any farther than I could throw his dad.", "No. Brand new car?  Past history?  There is no issue. Don\u2019t let the kid near the car.", "NTA. Why are you calling him? He can stay mad.", "NTA. I looked the car up and saw the price on it.

Can you even comfortably get 3 adults and a child in a car seat in an Urus? I dont think I have ever seen a car seat in a lamborghini and there is a reason why....", "Haha! \n\nDon\u2019t carpool. Remind him of last time, and need to elaborate further.

I don\u2019t remember how, but I do remember that part of my punishment was he took away a cup that I absolutely loved, and I remember being devastated.
