Nephew has proven himself to be a little monster, so it\u2019s reasonable to protect your expensive belongings.", "NTA. BUT, the reason your brother is mad is the way you phrased it and you are kind of an AH for that. Saying, \"Can you get him to behave?!\" implies a ton of judgement over their parenting style and a dislike of your nephew. That is why they're angry. A better way of approaching this would have been to say, \"Sure we could take my car, but I do have concerns about Nephew and messes (cite examples if needed), what can we do to make sure that doesn't happen?\" Voices your valid concern, keeps your sentiment to the issue at hand (and not all of his parenting), and offers up simple fixes that make everyone happy, like no food in the car, no messy toys, etc.", "NTA. your brother knows there is truth in your assessment of the kid, but doesn\u2019t want to own up to it.

The issue is more with the brother than the nephew and the parenting styles. There are certain things I don\u2019t give my kids in the back of a car, juice and markers being on that list, and that\u2019s how you control that.

I will say that when I was first reading this, I thought that the kid must be a baby because keeping them entertained can sometimes cause a mess. Instead, this kid is 7!

Letting a child use markers in someone else's car is simply bad patenting.", "So, OP needs to be the driver and parent the kid?\n\nJust sounds like you're hating on the Lamborghini to be honest.\n\nThey should've taken better care of his property.  \n\nJuice spills can happen but a 7 year old with markers isn't an accident.

And you should see now, that if to try and placate him you give him your car to borrow, it will come back ruined entirely to spite you. If they were willing to fuck up your last car even without them holding any resentment, they absolutely will destroy this car given that you've told them very clearly that they are bad parents and asshole relations.\n\nStop calling him because you crawling to him is giving him power in the situation", "NTA. However, you still need to watch your car like a cat with one kitten.

You were kind enough to lend your car out to them in a time of need and they absolutely took advantage of it and allowed their kid to wreck your property. I would have probably asked for them to pay for a detailing at least. But, these are the consequences of their poor parenting, and they're only just beginning. Their son is going to continue to cost them- money to replace things they break, damage, or ruin, social connections of people who don't feel obligated to continue a relationship with people who won't parent their child, who knows, their child may get into serious legal trouble one day. Seven is way too old to be acting like this and if you don't establish boundaries it'll continue to cost you too. Congrats on your promotion!", "AITAH!\n\nI'm confused by the NTA comments.\n\nIt's not like you didn't know you would expect your nephew to be in the car too. Why did you say yes and act surprised and start telling them how to parent?\n\nWhether you agree with their parenting or not this could have been handled in such a better way....\n\n1. Saying no...no need to offer an in depth explanation\n\n2. Tell a white lie...I'm going up a bit earlier than you...there isn't enough room as I need to take XYZ...the car seat won't fit....\n\n3. Go for something outrageous that would give everyone a talking point over dinner...the devil rides with me....I plan to get some roadkill along the way...I'm going to have my favourite serial killer podcast on the whole way (this is me btw)", "You need to learn from what happened and not be gaslit into calling it something else. Your nephew is messed up and your brother and SIL are messing him up by their lack of healthy parenting. This is not a small thing. This can ruin that kid\u2019s life and you are not helping by overlooking the obvious and using euphemisms like \u201ctends to make a mess\u201d instead of \u201cdestroys property.\u201d \n\nI was one of those kids when I was in elementary school. Early on, I was well behaved  and got along with everyone. Then after a few years of seeing people get drunk, beat each other up, having to scavenge for food and going hungry a lot of the time, I started fighting on the playground, destroying neighbors\u2019 flower beds, egging front doors. The police came to our house when I was 10 to warn my mother we were going to have big problems if things didn\u2019t change. A few months later, my sisters and I were in the county home for orphans. Just having regular meals and being able to sleep through the night was a revelation to me. (We only stayed a few months, while our dad went to court to get custody of us. Our mother got help. We all survived and are having good lives.) \n\nMy point is, kids are not inherently that bad or that good. Their behavior is learned. Home life may not be that bad for your nephew, but your brother and SIL are neglecting him. They are not giving him the attention he needs to learn healthy behavior. I\u2019m probably not saying this the right way, but I feel for the kid and at the same time, would not want to be around him or let him near my stuff. You pussyfooting around his destructive behavior is not helping. Your brother and SIL need a wake-up call.\n\nNTA for not wanting the kid in your car, but you are T A for not being upfront with your brother. They seriously need parenting coaching and their kid needs therapy to recover from their crap parenting.", "It's a Lamborghini.

Also to never borrow anything.", "Is a Lamborghini big enough to fit all these extra passengers comfortably anyway? Luxury and sport cars are not family sedans. It doesn't seem advisable regardless of the kid or not. They'd probably be more comfortable traveling with everyone in a normal car. Maybe rent a car if OP is still willing to drive. That's what I would do.", "I wouldn't let this kid or his parents in a 30 year-old Ford held together with duct tape and force of will, just because they're that obnoxious.", "I just googled it and it\u2019s a 4 door. Just looks like an SUV", "It's their only SUV.", "Ya, I guess there's piss and shit in there, too.", "I'm parent OF a 16 year old, that I'm 25 years older than, and sometimes I don't like my own kid in my own cheaper but beloved 2019 honda civic hatchback because I really really like my car and I hate when anyone messes up my personal belongings. I tolerate it from my kid but it's still annoying at times. I wouldn't tolerate it from anyone else and if I had a car 10 times as valuable as my own, like OP, I probably would be the only person I allowed inside it. These are normal feelings to feel.", "\u201cnephew is just a kid, you can\u2019t control that.\u201d\n\nOf course you can.  You don\u2019t give him food or markers while in the car!  You also can control it by not LETTING him in your car.\n\nI have no concept of how you think YOU caused conflict or why you feel like a villain - you might consider therapy for why you let your brother run roughshod over you.  The problem here seems to be that you don\u2019t know how to stand up for yourself, ESPECIALLY when you are right.\n\nNTA.  Tell your brother that you will NOT take your nephew anywhere in your car until he learns to behave.  And that if your brother REALLY THINKS that kids can\u2019t be controlled, then YOU THINK y\u2019all will be taking brothers car from now on.", "NTA please don\u2019t let the kid anywhere near your car and if he ruins it in any way sue them", "NTA.

Given the past behavior, there's no way they would ever make him behave or even recognize there's a problem. Your response should have been sorry I can't because of (some vaguely believable excuse) and leave it at that. They let him **draw on your leather seats with markers and shrugged.** You didn't really think they'd get him to behave, so why ask? They obviously don't want to hear it so bringing it up just made them mad because they can't handle the shame of being bad parents. They'll be shocked when he's arrested for vandalism, or worse.
