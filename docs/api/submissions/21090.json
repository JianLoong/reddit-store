I will call my half sister Cindy. Cindy is 27 years old and got married (is now divorced and a single mother). During that failed marriage she had 3 kids back to back to back. She now shares custody and gets them 3 days a week. You would think that she would be as involved as she can in those 3 days but nope. She went on to have a 4th child with some random man that wants nothing to do with that baby. My entire life growing up cindy has been older and resentful of the life i have with my dad. My dad is very successful and is able to give me and my little sister a great life. Cindy seems to think she is entitled to some part of what I have even though everyone except my mom hates her. She uses her kids as pawns to get back into peoples lives and have them babysit them. Every day she has those kids she is over at my house having my mom babysit the kids. I on the other hand don\u2019t put up with any of it i would die before I did anything for her. She has hated me and i\u2019ve hated her. Today is what made my hatred for her skyrocket though. She brought her kids over and made my mom watch the kids while she tanned on our hot tub. I walk outside and out of nowhere she accuses me of slamming her kids head in the door. And as someone who won\u2019t put up with her bs i told her to shut up cause we both know that\u2019s not true cause i have better things to do than entertain her. Her in her infinite knowledge told me she was \u201cgonna slap the fire out of me.\u201d Just to give some information on me I am not the type of person you want to start crap with. She was expecting me to just shut up and go inside but i got in her face and told her i bet she wouldn\u2019t do crap to me cause she knows exactly what would happen. And she had the AUDACITY to stay at MY house while tanning on our hot tub. My mom is mad at me for saying anything but my entire life my mom has taken cindys side.

You, mom, dad?", "NTA but your 1/2 sister needs to realize that she isn't going to have anyone around if she keeps verbally abusing them.  Your mom sucks because she can't tell her oldest daughter \"NO\" and is a doormat under the guise she won't see her grandchildren again.  Your sister lays hands on you it's assault, and you should press charges.  If your mom wants to rug-sweep this behavior talk with your dad.", "NTA. Your mother feels guilty for something with your sister and thinks that siding with her, it's compensating for whatever she missed. But with this enabling she is doing a bigger damage to her, she is keeping her from growing. Now, the new kids are affected because they don't have a functional mother. You can try to talk to your mom, calmly and maturely. Don't confront her, but you can start by asking if there is something she wants to talk about. Maybe the issues will start coming up. Tell her she was a good mother,  and if she made mistakes, it's ok because nobody is perfect, and regardless of what she did well or wrong, she is done. Now is her daughter's turn to be the mom and needs to grow up to it. She may not see it, but the kids are the ones who are going to be affected by this behavior. She can offer her help when she needs to work or she is sick, but other than that, those are her kids, and she will not babysit anymore. Hopefully, she will see the light and see how much damage them both are doing to the children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe just let it go. She\u2019s your sister.", "Yeah, you're a very hate-filled person and you seem to not realize that your half-sister is still your mom's full daughter, every bit as much her daughter as you are.  The ugliness between you and your sister is a wash, assholery-wise but despising your mom for being a caring and supportive mother and grandmother, for enjoying watching her grandbabies, and for letting her daughter come over and enjoy the amenities in her home absolutely makes YTA.", "ESH, except the Mom, I feel sorry she has 2 adult children acting like mean spirited cry babies.", "Something seems fishy, here. I\u2019m going to vote ESH.\n\nMom for being a doormat\n\nDad for not putting his foot down.\n\nCindy for being manipulative with her children.\n\nOP for being overly judgmental about her sister.", "I feel like I\u2019m missing context that I need to really give an opinion, why do you and cindy hate each other? Does your mum express any issue with babysitting or does she volunteer? If she\u2019s happy to do it, I don\u2019t think your anger about it is justified really. Where did the comment about you slamming her kids head into a door come from, that seemed really random? Did the kid bang their head and she blamed you or? Details missing here.", "My mom doesn\u2019t make any payments on the house. I have a job so i do help my dad out with payments because i feel like i owe him for everything he\u2019s done for me.", "My dad. My mom contributes nothing to the house. Also a little update i told my dad about everything and he has also been getting mad at cindy being at the house 24/7 he voices his opinion about it a lot more but nothing ever escalated before today.", "Being a sister it's not a free pass to behave like that, specially when it's the mom's husband house. Not hers.", "If you knew everything she has done to me you would understand. My entire life she has resenting me for having a \u201cbetter life\u201d and it has shown. She says im not her real sister and she will never be there for me. So it makes sense that now that im grown im never going to be there for her.", "My mother doesn\u2019t enjoy watching them all the time though. In another comment i explained it better but my mom has voiced that she doesn\u2019t want to watch them all the time and cindy took the kids and refused to talk to my mom for weeks.  My mom also does not appreciate the fact that everything she has is taken advantage of by cindy.", "Okay so, cindy had hated me all of my life and growing up i always tried talking to her and being close with her but she would always say i wasn\u2019t her real sister and i didn\u2019t deserve everything i have. My mom constantly expresses that she wants to have free time and it\u2019s impossible when she always has a kid with her. Everytime in the past that my mom had said something about cindy keeping her kids more cindy would take the kids and not let my mom see them for weeks. Cindy kinda just dumps them on my mom and leaves. And i\u2019m just as confused about the door comment. I walked outside and that\u2019s immediately what she said, that\u2019s why i got so defensive and mad at her. She pulled that out of nowhere even though i had been in the kitchen the whole time.", "Thanks for the context! Based off your reply I would say NTA, sounds like a hard dynamic you\u2019ve had to navigate I\u2019m sorry to hear it! \ud83d\udc95"]}
