It\u2019s especially social stuff that I struggle a lot with atm.\n\nSo two of my close friends have invited me to their nye party. It\u2019s also to celebrate one of their birthdays. It\u2019s gonna be pretty big, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever done anything like this before, so it\u2019s a big deal.\n\nThe thing is, there are going to be a lot of people I know there. I\u2019m talking like high school and college acquaintances that I haven\u2019t seen in a while. Seeing all of them and having them ask about my life is pretty much my worst nightmare atm, because I don\u2019t have any answers and I\u2019m embarrassed. So I don\u2019t want to go to the party, but I feel like a crappy friend because they\u2019re close friends and I think this is a big deal to them.\n\nI already feel like a crappy friend because I often fall out of touch and stuff, so I feel like this would be a really sucky thing for me to do.\n\nWIBTA if I told my friends I won\u2019t go to their party? (Either tell them the truth or make up an excuse)\n\n\nEdit: oh shit I just remembered another thing that might make me TA. I\u2019m going to see a musical soon that I\u2019m actually excited about. And I think it might seem like if I can do that, which is a lot more people than are going to be at the party, I must be doing alright. But in my stupid brain I don\u2019t have a problem with being around a bunch of strangers, it\u2019s people I know that I\u2019m afraid of.

I know that in the fog of depression everything seems hopeless, but you\u2019re 22, and I can guarantee you that most of us in our early 20 we didn\u2019t have everything figured out as to what we wanted to do with our life. Everyone\u2019s journey is gonna look a little bit different, don\u2019t be too hard on yourself, take things one day at the time by working in your mental health first. I wish you the best of luck, and a fast healing!", "NTA. (Please don\u2019t take this the wrong way bc your mental health matters 110%) But seriously...you being depressed doesn\u2019t matter in this instance. It has zero bearing on why you don\u2019t want to go. You don\u2019t want to go. Full stop. \u201cThis sounds awesome. I\u2019m sure it will be fun but I\u2019m unable to attend. I wish you all the best.\u201d That a polite response and the only thing that matters is you have informed them you\u2019re unavailable. Your reasonings do NOT factor into a decision such as this. You don\u2019t have to give a reason if you don\u2019t want to and I encourage you to not give reasons as an adult. If someone wants something and you give a reason they will have ten reasons why you are wrong. No (or no thanks) is a complete response.", "Nope. NTA. You gotta take care of yourself.

But don't beat yourself up if you aren't better by tomorrow or if you can't get yourself to actually attend.\nIf they're real friends as you wrote that they are supportive, they understand why you feel anxious. You can also tell them: well it will be another 2 months, I am not quite sure how I'll feel then but for now it gives me so much stress only thinking about it.
