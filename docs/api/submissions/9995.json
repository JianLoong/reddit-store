There was this one guy (21m) who we will call Mike, in our high school who would constantly flirt with younger girls, and about a year ago, started my best friend.\n\nSince I became friends with Holly at a young age, I knew her home life very well and noticed the neglect that her parents inflicted on her. She hasn't talked about it much, but it caused her to abuse marijuana, eventually dating her dealer, Mike.\n\nI had never thought this relationship was a good idea and told her from the start. She is a straight-A student who graduated from high school with a 4.6 GPA, while her boyfriend dropped out. Despite my efforts, she has stayed with him.\n\nOver the past few months, I have noticed a change in her behavior and mood when talking about Mike. She gets quiet and tries to change the conversation. I once asked her what had happened and the most she said to me was that she didn't feel valued in their relationship anymore. I knew she wouldn't be able to break up with him, so I had to step in.\n\nFor Valentine's Day, her boyfriend insinuated that he would surprise her with a gift, and she was pretty excited. Today, Valentine's Day, Mike gave her a gift to give to her, which was a pair of Valentino shoes that she wanted for a while. Instead of giving them to her, I went to the store where he bought them from (checked from the receipt) and returned them, getting the cash back, and planned on using it for her after they break up.\n\nAn hour ago, she came into my dorm crying, saying how my relationship with Mike was for real over, and beyond repair. Apparently, he was also a liar and the fact that the shoes were never given proved him as a gaslighter in her eyes. She said, although I never liked their relationship, she respected me honestly and believed she should've listened to me sooner.\n\nSo in conclusion, AITA for breaking up their relationship, even though I know she would eventually be happier without him?\n\nEdit: in high school, Holly did something similar to me (lied to break my romantic relationship), and although I mad for a week, I eventually thanked her and respected her loyalty to keeping me safe", "created_utc": 1676428527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112ncce/aita_for_throwing_away_my_best_friends_valentines/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

HOLY HELL, I'd be wanting to know where the gift is, if I was that guy and pressing charges against the person who stole them.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your place to sabotage her relationship. She\u2019s 19 and in college, not like her life is in the dumps.

Why would he give them to you or her with the receipt?", "YTA\n\nFirst off, I think this is fake. Even if it isn't, you're still wildly out of line. No one asked you to \"step in\".... Honestly, who do you think you are?!?! Returning a gift and then planning to use the money to \"buy her something after they break up\"..... Oh, so you can pass it off as a gift from you???? You also gonna deny he gave you the gift when the subject comes up?? \n\nLet me also add that what you did was technically stealing..... You should be (at the very least) looking at a larceny charge if you're caught. Which, if this is true, I hope you are caught and soon", "YTA. \n\nAlso a liar and a thief.", "YTA. That was a terrible thing to do. Terrible.", "YTA and you are right. Holly is in an abusive relationship but it isn\u2019t with Mike, it\u2019s with you.\n\nYou are not only an abuser, but also a thief and liar.. Holly deserves better then you. Please end this friendship and let her find friends that will actually respect her.\n\nReturn the money to Mike as well you thief.", "YTA. He trusted you and you've lied to your friend. I get that you believe this was for the best but you returned her gift and pocketed the money. That's just not ok.", "Not only are you YTA You're seriously creepy.", "YTA. You don't like their relationship so you actively sabotaged it. When she finds out, she's never going to trust you again. And that's when, because she will find out somehow. You need to tell her, give Mike back the money you stole from him, and stay out of their lives. You've done enough damage and you know it.", "So you just stole about $2,000 from a drug dealer? Not smart, OP. And it was all for nothing, because your \u201cfriend\u201d is probably going to get a restraining order against you when she figures out what you\u2019ve done. YTA.", "YTA I get being upset that your friend seems to be dating down, but unless he's doing her genuine harm mentally, socially, or physically, you have no right to intervene.", "YTA.\n\nYou seem like a friend that is very concerned about your best friend Holly, but what you did was wildly inappropriate. You have no business returning someone else's property and sabotaging their relationship regardless if you feel a certain way about the circumstance. There are healthy alternative ways to speak to your best friend and communicate your concerns. It's only going to be a matter of time until she finds out what you did, and I'm going to have to say that I don't think she's going to appreciate what you did.", "Of course YTA.\n\nLook, she\u2019s not your child, she\u2019s an adult woman.  Generally speaking, interfering in and breaking up other people\u2019s relationships is self-centered asshole behavior.  (One can reasonably argue an exception for an abusive relationship, especially one severe enough that one fears permanent harm or death.)  You decided he wasn\u2019t good enough and did a spectacularly shitty thing to break them up.\n\nIt\u2019s not your decision.  The fact that you believe she\u2019ll be happier without him doesn\u2019t matter.  This is like dressing her like a doll or child every day against her wishes because you think you know better what clothing flatters her, but worse.", "YTA.\n\nAs a friend it\u2019s not your job to break up their relationship. it\u2019s your job to be there for her when she\u2019s strong enough to leave him herself.", "YTA. You caused their breakup, and you clearly didn't think this through. At some point he's going to ask about the shoes, and she'll respond, and you'll be asked and if you don't tell her the truth then YOU'RE the one screwing with her head. She will not forgive you, and it will end with her being even closer to him. You should really tell her immediately what you did, give her the money, and apologize profusely because you messed up big time.", "YTA wtf", "YTA for not admitting to your friend you\u2019re in love with her.

Accept it or just delete this and move on.", "INFO: you do realize that Mike 100% knows you stole from him and destroyed his relationship, right?\n\nYou keep saying in the comments that it\u2019s okay that you stole because Mike has done much worse. You realize that none of that will matter at all if he turns you in, right? His crimes have nothing to do with your crime and no one is going to accept that excuse.\n\nAlso, are you safe? Because you just stole a significant amount of money from someone who you know is bad news. What\u2019s your plan if he retaliates?\n\nI\u2019m less concerned about whether or not you\u2019re an asshole, more concerned about the fact that you\u2019re impulsive and naive.", "YTA. \n\nYour 'friend' sounds like she is is surrounded by terrible people on each side. Quite frankly, I don't trust your description of their relationship since you're quite willing to overlook your own manipulations / theft too.", "OP thank you for saving your friend from such a horrible bf since you know for a fact that she'd obviously be much happier without him and be in a relationship with you.  She's definitely going to revel in the fact that you saved her from a life of misery.  I personally would recommend that you just spend the money on yourself since it would obviously make you look like not only a liar and thief, but a giant loser for your plan to be perfect if you want to keep thinking that you're above it all and know what's best.  Definitely be on the lookout to make sure that you keep anyone else that could steal her away from you out of the picture, so you can continue your growing and abusive relationship with her.  We're all rooting for you!", "YTA-Regardless of your reasons for doing so you had no right to do what you did and the one she needs to leave is you.", "OP, I have to thank you.  Your level of asshole-ary is beyond anything I could have imagined.\n\nListening to yourself try and say what a good person you are, how you did this to protect Holly, to justify your actions has been nothing short of entertaining.\n\nIf this is the kind of shit you do to your \u201cbest friend\u201d, I would love to see what you do to someone you claim to not like.\n\nYou are so clearly delusional to think that you are justified for ANYTHING you have done.\n\nLet\u2019s recap what you\u2019ve done to your best friend:\nLied to her\nStolen from her \nGaslighted her \nBetrayed her\nBroken her trust, she just doesn\u2019t know it yet\n\nSuch a petty, selfish, fucked yo justification you have for you asshole-ness.\n\nCongrats.
