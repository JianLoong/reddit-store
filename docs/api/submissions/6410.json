I (M21) am disabled, full time wheelchair user, and live in a fairly small college town with a couple friends. My roommates and I are part of a larger friend group of 8 people, and I\u2019d say we\u2019re all pretty close. I really love my roommates, they\u2019re great, but sometimes a little thick. There\u2019s one person in the large friend group, let\u2019s call him Chris, who is dating a guy, let\u2019s call him James. I really don\u2019t like James for many reason, mostly petty ones to be honest. But another fact, James is vegetarian. That\u2019s not a problem in itself, but Herein comes the issue. \n\nAll of us planned on getting dinner on New Year\u2019s Eve. Smallish college town, there are three main restaurants to choose from that are open in the nearby area. One of them is a steakhouse, one of them is a Thai place, one of them is a sort of hippie plant-based place. James immediately suggests the plant-based one. I give a veto, as it\u2019s completely inaccessible, and give the alternative of ordering take-out from there and bringing it back to my place. But we recently started fostering a cat, and one of our other friends is allergic to cats, so that\u2019s also a no-go. \n\nNone of the other friends are able to host a gathering for various reasons, so I suggest we go to the Thai place. It\u2019s a nice spot, and reasonably accessible. But apparently James and Chris went to the Thai place last week for their anniversary, and don\u2019t want to go back. I then suggest the steakhouse, but of course that is loudly shut down because James is a vegetarian. \n\nLong story short, the group did a vote between the hippie place and the Thai place, not even including the steakhouse, and the plant-based place won. I admitted that I was slightly frustrated to my roommates, who said that they can bring food back after. I said that that wasn\u2019t the issue, but sure. \n\nSo New Year\u2019s Eve comes and they get back from dinner, and James and Chris also stop by. At this point it\u2019s pretty late and I\u2019m a couple drinks in, and I flat out tell James that I think it\u2019s shitty that he suggested and then subsequently campaigned for a place that he knows that I can\u2019t go to. He said that it\u2019s fair because I suggested the steakhouse, knowing he\u2019s a vegetarian. I told him that it\u2019s different, because he could have at the very least physically been present. He insisted that it\u2019s the same, and I asked him to leave the apartment because I was I was tired of dealing with his bullshit. \n\nSo he left, and my roommates think I overreacted. Maybe I did.

Him being vegetarian and you being *physically unable to access the restaurant* are completely different things.

You gave plenty of options, and they specifically chose the one that directly excluded you.", "NTA - James' diet is his choice, you being disabled is not. He could have gotten a salad at the steakhouse, or he and Chris could have sucked it up and gone to the Thai place once more.\n\nThey literally decided that eating at the same restaurant twice in two weeks was worse than having you around. Chris and James majorly suck, but your other friends aren't much better for going along with this. Also, one or two people could have decided to skip the restaurant and stay with you.\n\nThese people aren't good friends.", "NTA. Who the hell cares that they went to the Thai place last week? They can go again. It's a small college town! Not like there's a whole range of options here. The other people who also voted for the vegetarian place share some blame too.\n\nSide note: as long as you keep calling it a hippie place, you're never going to win people over.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, most steakhouses have vegetarian options. In the very worst case, he could have gotten a salad and a drink.\n\nYou could not physically get in the chosen restaurant.\n\nHe is not the only asshole though, all of your friends are.", "INFO:  when you say the plant based restaurant was \"inaccessible\" do you mean \"Wheel Chair Accessible\"?  As in, \"you are not physically able to go into the restaurant\".\n\nIf that be the case the your friends are major AH's here.  Why would they pick a restaurant that you physically cannot go into?  Being vegetarian, by the most part, is a choice.  Being in a wheelchair isn't.  It's not rocket science.", "NTA. There's plenty of vegetarian options at steak houses too. James isn't your friend so he doesn't owe you anything BUT it's really shitty of your friends to go along with that and vote for a place knowing it'll exclude you. You need better friends.", "Nta. Vegetarianism is a choice. Wheelchair access is not. My partner is deathly allergic to peanuts.and cannot even enter a Thai restaurant. That's super different from food preferences, ability equity is non-negotiable. Sucks you have to deal with this ignorance.", "NTA. You have every right to stand your ground and to not have to tolerate the company who has no interest in your wellbeing. \n\nAlso, the fact that your friends found that his vegetarianism was a more significant ultimatum than your accessibility (going to a place he likely couldn't eat was completely off the table whereas a place you absolutely physically cannot enter was acceptable enough not only to be put to a vote but also to be voted for) says something very unfavourable about your circle of friends. Dietary stuff is difficult to arrange but I cant imagine my group of friends even considering a place that someone couldn't get into due to disability. I'm horrified by this kind of prioritisation to be quite honest, let alone that the compromise that would suit you both was voted against just because they've been there recently.", "NTA but I find it strange that none of your friends stood up for you. They were happier to not have you rather than forcing a vegetarian to eat fries at stakehouse\n\nEither your friends really dislike you for reasons not related to this post or they are so thick that you should look for better company", "Here\u2019s my problem, while James may have suggested it, all of your roommates were the ones who voted towards the plant based restaurant. No one stood up for you, and everyone decided to go there, rather than going to a more accessible restaurant or splitting into two groups so that everyone could go where they wanted to, and then reconvene somewhere else. So I would say NTA, but you\u2019re directing all of your anger at James, who only suggested the place, rather than your \u201cfriends\u201d who all decided to go there and leave you behind. Just something to think about.", "NTA. The thai place was an excellent compromise and I\u2019m horrified that your friends chose a place you couldn\u2019t access, instead. James sounds like a tool.", "NTA, but you might want to consider where your \u201cfriends\u201d decided to go, even knowing you would be left out.", "NTA. What would infuriate me the most is that everyone (including the other friends) chose to go to the restaurant you physically couldn\u2019t go to even after you brought up that point. And then the fact James brought up that you suggested the steak house which wasn\u2019t even part of what they voted on is ridiculous.", "Lol what? You have a physical disability that literally makes you unable to access the restaurant. He chooses to be vegetarian. How are those the same thing when one is a CHOICE? He could have got Thai one more time or some side dishes at the steakhouse but he deliberately chose a place where you are unable to enter. He is the AH and your friends who chose the same restaurant are also AH. I wouldn\u2019t even accept a restaurant without accessibility to be in the list. Period.", "Nta. It's pretty rude to purposefully exclude someone because of a disability just because they don't want to be around people eating meat", "NTA\n\nYour friends are AHs and so is that restaurant. What kind of restaurant is not wheelchair accessible?", "NTA shit move by your friends to go somewhere they know you can\u2019t. I just don\u2019t think you can compare a physical disability to being vegetarian. Might want to think about branching out with some new friends.", "NTA. My cousin is in a wheelchair. When I lived with him, we always made it work. Inaccessibility was just out of the question (also ignorant of the business owner in my opinion) every food place has SOMETHING a vegetarian can eat, not every food place is accessible. He was just doing that to exclude you.", "NTA. I went to steakhouses w/ friends when I was a vegetarian. I ate a baked potato and soup or some related combo. If he were vegan, that is a different story. That just is not the same as a place being wheelchair inaccessible and it is really rude to compare the two.", "no offense, but you friends are shit. I personally would never go to a nye party meant for friends that excludes someone like this. James chose to be vegan, you didnt choose to be in a wheelchair, so his whole \"its the same\" attitude is so gross. NTA", "NTA. There are vegetarian options everywhere you go. Some might not be great (I have ordered 3 sides of fries, corn on the cob and steamed veggie plate once) but there are options. Not being able to even get into the restaurant is not giving you an option at all and excluding you. For your \"friends\" to go along with them excluding you, says a lot about them.", "NTA.  But I don't think the problem is James, but your roommates.  They didn't take your disability and your presence, as part of the group into consideration.   They don't see you as part of the tight knit group.", "NTA Many others have commented why James sucks but I\u2019m side eyeing all of your friends as well.

Remind them that you don\u2019t get to choose being in a wheelchair, but James does get yo choose what he can order at any restaurant.

NTA, but your friends seem to be.", ">They literally decided that eating at the same restaurant twice in two weeks was worse than having you around\n\nThis is just a different way of framing it, but this is what actually went down.", "I don\u2019t really think calling it a \u201chippie place\u201d is a dig\u2026 hippie is the vibe many vegan restaurants go for.", "You do realize hippie isn't the insult it used to be right? Many people happily embrace the \"hippie\" label and even strive for it.", "Exactly there should have never been a vote it should have just been up to op", "Actually no, a lot of times most of the sides are made with meat. Frying things in lard, mixing bacon into brussel sprouts, serving salads with bacon bits or other meat on it... it's not a good bet.\n\nNot saying his friends weren't assholes, but steakhouses are not for vegetarians.", "Does that particular steakhouse have vegetarian options?", "It\u2019s a little spot that\u2019s up a small flight of stairs with no ramp, so yeah. I\u2019ve never been inside, obviously, but I can\u2019t imagine the inside is very easy to navigate either", "Many steak houses use animal based fats for frying food just fyi", "Why would a vegetarian eat fries there? If there\u2019s nothing at a restaurant that I can eat other than some fried thing I\u2019m just going to go elsewhere.", "A lot of them. You\u2019d be surprised. A lot of places in general, really. It doesn\u2019t help that a lot of the nearby town area is fairly historic, so most buildings are super old.", "There are a lot of restaurants in America that aren\u2019t wheelchair accessible. If the building was built prior to 1970 it is exempt from ADA laws.", "Not sure why James is getting all the hate here.  Multiple other people voted for the place OP cannot go, and even more went knowing OP couldn\u2019t. Those people are just as shitty as James.", "Personally I think that the Thai place would have been the best compromise, despite two of the group having recently been there \u2014 a far cry from not accessible.", "Even if salad was the only option, why did no one suggest that he could order take out from the vegetarian place? Why did OP, who is disabled, have to be the one left out?", "No main entrees unfortunately, but a lot of the sides and appetizers are vegetarian. They have some stuffed mushrooms that are good, mashed potatoes, etc. I do get why a vegetarian wouldn\u2019t want to go to a steakhouse though.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. Leaving out someone because of their disability is nowhere near the same as someone having limited options for choosing to be a vegetarian.", "Nope, you\u2019re flat out wrong. A dietary *choice* that may mean limited menu options for James is never the same as someone being disabled, which is not a choice.", "No, they suggested the Thai place, which the couple refused because they just went there. And then they suggested the steakhouse.\n\nThe OP gave a reasonable suggestion that two people didn't want because they ate there a week ago and so instead of doing something she could do, they purposefully leave her out.\n\nIf the steakhouse had been her first go, I'd call OP an AH, but given it was their last choice, I lean towards NTA.", "The only other option was Thai, which OP said was fine. But James didn\u2019t want to eat at the same place 2 weeks in a row. The friends all suck too for accepting that excuse. OP can\u2019t physically go to the vegan place. James could go to a steakhouse. Just because you are vegetarian doesn\u2019t mean you can watch other people eat meat. Does James avoid every other restaurant that serves meat?", "I mean, they proposed getting takeout, but someone is allergic to cats, then they suggested the Thai place, which the couple shot down because they just went there, and THEN OP suggested the steakhouse.\n\nA little different from putting the steakhouse first, imo.\n\nNTA.", "You TA for suggesting vegetarianism, a dietary *choice*, is anywhere near the same as being disabled, which is never a choice. OP suggested the steak house but then the vote was between the Thai place and the vegetarian place. The vegetarian place shouldn\u2019t have even been considered since OP can\u2019t get into it at all.", "They accommodate a cat allergy (take an allergy pill FFS, your just eating there, not sleeping there) and a vegetarian (they could eat some things at the steakhouse or go to the Thai place and it\u2019s a lifestyle choice not a disability) over someone in a wheelchair. What terrible friends.", "Every damn steakhouse I\u2019ve ever been to has vegetarian options, you just have to ask for them. \n\nActually one of the steak places in my town has the best damn roasted veggies and stuffed mushrooms, even if I don\u2019t want meat I usually advocate to go there for the roasted veggies and the stuffed mushrooms.", "I'm vegetarian.  Every steakhouse has a baked potato and salad available.   Is it amazing?  No but it's perfectly doable.\n\nJames is vile to compare a mediocre meal to not being able to even enter a place. And the supposed friends who voted to keep OP at home aren't much better.", "I\u2019m a vegetarian and this was my first thought as well\u2014virtually any restaurant will have something vegan or vegetarian on the menu, even a steakhouse.", "Everywhere does a vegan or vegetarian option these days, literally everywhere. Granted they probably aren\u2019t fully vegan/veggie given all the disclaimers about them being cooked on the same grill/fryer etc but still. Not everywhere has ramps, lifts etc. which is pretty damn crappy.", "It doesn\u2019t matter because it would\u2019ve been much easier for James to order take out from somewhere else than OP being left behind because they are disabled and literally can\u2019t get in somewhere. Leaving someone out because they are disabled, which isn\u2019t a choice, is infinitely worse than a vegetarian being in a steakhouse. Doesn\u2019t even come close.", "So James is an ableist and all the friends who voted for the plant based place are ableist as well.\n\nAs a vegetarian, I would have picked the Thai place.\n\nAlso next time have your comebacks faster. You first suggested Thai (which you both could have enjoyed) but he 100% ignored it. He is for sure an ableist.", "isn\u2019t that illegal ?  i thought wheelchair accessibility is a federal law", "Even if it was 4000 square feet of wide open space inside is irrelevant because you couldn't even get to the front door.  Those \"friends\" of yours that chose that place need to be put into their place.  Just because they wanted to go there so bad, they thought it was \"ok\" to shut you out.  What massive AH's and I hope this New Year brings you better friends.  Best of luck", ">Why would a vegetarian eat fries there? If there\u2019s nothing at a restaurant that I can eat other than some fried thing I\u2019m just going to go elsewhere.\n\nIf you have a choice of 2 restaurants - one that meets your diet, and one your friend can \\*physically enter\\* - you would choose the one your friend can't enter?  Rather than going to the one they can enter and finding \\*something\\* edible on their menu?", "Are you in Europe?", "I took it that they didn't want to go to the Thai place because they didn't like it, not that it was because they were just there last week, if that's the case, then that was a perfectly more reasonable option than just excluding a friend. They only have 3 restaurants to choose from, they shouldn't be that picky.", "Maybe the rest of them like the veggie place more?", "But it\u2019s doesn\u2019t come close yo being left out because of a disability. Don\u2019t let anyone try to tell you that you were wrong for suggesting the steakhouse.", "Do they have limited vegetarian options or no vegetarian options?", "Are there limited options on that menu or none?", "Are there vegetarian options at that steakhouse? I wouldn\u2019t go to a restaurant where I couldn\u2019t get a meal I could eat.", "I am not vegan/vegetarian, so I don't know any more than I know what that restaurant had on its menu.  \n\nI do know that finding a place everyone could go to was a complete fail on everyone's part.  Somebody was going to be dissatisfied with every one of these choices, hence, ESH.", "No he's even worse because they couldn't handle having Thai food two weeks in a row. Like try something new there.", "It does matter. OP could order take out just as easily as James could. Do you really think it\u2019s \u201cmuch easier\u201d for a person who isn\u2019t in a wheelchair to order door dash? \ud83e\udd23 \n\nWhy would James or his boyfriend want to go to a restaurant he couldn\u2019t eat at?", "Not if it\u2019s an old building. If they built it new or renovated a large portion it would have to become accessible", "Not everywhere is 'Merica'.", "It is, but the law only states that reasonable accomodation is required, so the owners can opt out if the financial burden of the accomodation can be proven to be harmful to the business.  I'm not certain of the particulars, but I think that's the gist of the reasoning.  And that would make sense with an old building.", "Could be in Canada. So many places here have at least a couple steps you need to navigate to get in. \n\nMost restaurants are in old building that can be grandfathered in with regards to accessibility laws. I don\u2019t even think accessibility is enforced where I am (Newfoundland), you just need to check the rules and follow them if you want accessibility status.", "fam liking an inaccessible restaurant more than liking including your friend in a wheelchair makes you an AH lol.", "Maybe they could\u2019ve gone to the steak place then. The point is, they left out someone who is disabled. Who is in a wheelchair. Which had no problem with the food but literally couldn\u2019t go there. \n\nStop being dense.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. Leaving someone physically disabled behind is wrong. The end.", "You must be James at this point. Hi James.", "I\u2019m sure there is. Salad, sides etc. It sucks to not have a ton of options for one meal, but it would suck worse to be in a wheelchair for your entire life, and not physically be able to go to dinner. I really blame the friends more than even James, because no one stepped up and supported OP. Clearly the Thai place was the best option, but it seems everyone defended James and Chris not having to eat in the same restaurant two weeks in a row. Such a dumb issue", "So how about the guy who chooses his diet versus the person with a disability that is out of their control? Or do you think OP shouldn\u2019t want their friends to include them?", "So screw the disabled person and just leave them behind? Why do you hate people in wheelchairs?", "It\u2019s not about eating. It\u2019s about spending time with friends. Eating just happened to be the activity.\n\nThey made it so one person absolutely could not go when there were other options. They are assholes.", "Maybe op sucks as friend. Any number of reasons the group voted for a restaurant he can't get to.", "You haven\u2019t seen the menu but you have decided that they have those options?\n\nBecause OP\u2019s life sucks more James should have to eat some little salad while everyone else gets a full meal? That\u2019s ridiculous. It sounds like most of the friends just wanted to go to the veggie restaurant.", "Lol \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019ve never been to a steakhouse that didn\u2019t have salads. And sides are always veggies (potatoes, broccoli, mushrooms). So yes I decided that.   And no, poor James should have compromised and gone back to the Thai restaurant. God forbid he do that. Maybe get some curry instead of the pad Thai he got last time? Ya know, change it up a bit?  The \u201cfriends\u201d are all assholes for not supporting that compromise."]}
