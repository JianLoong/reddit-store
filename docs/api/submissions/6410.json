I (M21) am disabled, full time wheelchair user, and live in a fairly small college town with a couple friends. My roommates and I are part of a larger friend group of 8 people, and I\u2019d say we\u2019re all pretty close. I really love my roommates, they\u2019re great, but sometimes a little thick. There\u2019s one person in the large friend group, let\u2019s call him Chris, who is dating a guy, let\u2019s call him James. I really don\u2019t like James for many reason, mostly petty ones to be honest. But another fact, James is vegetarian. That\u2019s not a problem in itself, but Herein comes the issue. \n\nAll of us planned on getting dinner on New Year\u2019s Eve. Smallish college town, there are three main restaurants to choose from that are open in the nearby area. One of them is a steakhouse, one of them is a Thai place, one of them is a sort of hippie plant-based place. James immediately suggests the plant-based one. I give a veto, as it\u2019s completely inaccessible, and give the alternative of ordering take-out from there and bringing it back to my place. But we recently started fostering a cat, and one of our other friends is allergic to cats, so that\u2019s also a no-go. \n\nNone of the other friends are able to host a gathering for various reasons, so I suggest we go to the Thai place. It\u2019s a nice spot, and reasonably accessible. But apparently James and Chris went to the Thai place last week for their anniversary, and don\u2019t want to go back. I then suggest the steakhouse, but of course that is loudly shut down because James is a vegetarian. \n\nLong story short, the group did a vote between the hippie place and the Thai place, not even including the steakhouse, and the plant-based place won. I admitted that I was slightly frustrated to my roommates, who said that they can bring food back after. I said that that wasn\u2019t the issue, but sure. \n\nSo New Year\u2019s Eve comes and they get back from dinner, and James and Chris also stop by. At this point it\u2019s pretty late and I\u2019m a couple drinks in, and I flat out tell James that I think it\u2019s shitty that he suggested and then subsequently campaigned for a place that he knows that I can\u2019t go to. He said that it\u2019s fair because I suggested the steakhouse, knowing he\u2019s a vegetarian. I told him that it\u2019s different, because he could have at the very least physically been present. He insisted that it\u2019s the same, and I asked him to leave the apartment because I was I was tired of dealing with his bullshit. \n\nSo he left, and my roommates think I overreacted. Maybe I did.

He could have gotten a salad at the steakhouse, or he and Chris could have sucked it up and gone to the Thai place once more.\n\nThey literally decided that eating at the same restaurant twice in two weeks was worse than having you around. Chris and James majorly suck, but your other friends aren't much better for going along with this. Also, one or two people could have decided to skip the restaurant and stay with you.\n\nThese people aren't good friends.", "NTA. Who the hell cares that they went to the Thai place last week? They can go again. It's a small college town! Not like there's a whole range of options here. The other people who also voted for the vegetarian place share some blame too.\n\nSide note: as long as you keep calling it a hippie place, you're never going to win people over.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, most steakhouses have vegetarian options. In the very worst case, he could have gotten a salad and a drink.\n\nYou could not physically get in the chosen restaurant.\n\nHe is not the only asshole though, all of your friends are.", "INFO:  when you say the plant based restaurant was \"inaccessible\" do you mean \"Wheel Chair Accessible\"?  As in, \"you are not physically able to go into the restaurant\".\n\nIf that be the case the your friends are major AH's here.  Why would they pick a restaurant that you physically cannot go into?  Being vegetarian, by the most part, is a choice.  Being in a wheelchair isn't.  It's not rocket science.", "NTA. There's plenty of vegetarian options at steak houses too. James isn't your friend so he doesn't owe you anything BUT it's really shitty of your friends to go along with that and vote for a place knowing it'll exclude you. You need better friends.", "Nta. Vegetarianism is a choice. Wheelchair access is not. My partner is deathly allergic to peanuts.and cannot even enter a Thai restaurant. That's super different from food preferences, ability equity is non-negotiable. Sucks you have to deal with this ignorance.", "NTA. You have every right to stand your ground and to not have to tolerate the company who has no interest in your wellbeing. \n\nAlso, the fact that your friends found that his vegetarianism was a more significant ultimatum than your accessibility (going to a place he likely couldn't eat was completely off the table whereas a place you absolutely physically cannot enter was acceptable enough not only to be put to a vote but also to be voted for) says something very unfavourable about your circle of friends. Dietary stuff is difficult to arrange but I cant imagine my group of friends even considering a place that someone couldn't get into due to disability. I'm horrified by this kind of prioritisation to be quite honest, let alone that the compromise that would suit you both was voted against just because they've been there recently.", "NTA but I find it strange that none of your friends stood up for you. They were happier to not have you rather than forcing a vegetarian to eat fries at stakehouse\n\nEither your friends really dislike you for reasons not related to this post or they are so thick that you should look for better company", "Here\u2019s my problem, while James may have suggested it, all of your roommates were the ones who voted towards the plant based restaurant. No one stood up for you, and everyone decided to go there, rather than going to a more accessible restaurant or splitting into two groups so that everyone could go where they wanted to, and then reconvene somewhere else. So I would say NTA, but you\u2019re directing all of your anger at James, who only suggested the place, rather than your \u201cfriends\u201d who all decided to go there and leave you behind. Just something to think about.", "NTA. The thai place was an excellent compromise and I\u2019m horrified that your friends chose a place you couldn\u2019t access, instead. James sounds like a tool.", "NTA, but you might want to consider where your \u201cfriends\u201d decided to go, even knowing you would be left out.", "NTA. What would infuriate me the most is that everyone (including the other friends) chose to go to the restaurant you physically couldn\u2019t go to even after you brought up that point. And then the fact James brought up that you suggested the steak house which wasn\u2019t even part of what they voted on is ridiculous.", "Lol what? You have a physical disability that literally makes you unable to access the restaurant. He chooses to be vegetarian. How are those the same thing when one is a CHOICE? He could have got Thai one more time or some side dishes at the steakhouse but he deliberately chose a place where you are unable to enter. He is the AH and your friends who chose the same restaurant are also AH. I wouldn\u2019t even accept a restaurant without accessibility to be in the list. Period.", "Nta. It's pretty rude to purposefully exclude someone because of a disability just because they don't want to be around people eating meat", "NTA\n\nYour friends are AHs and so is that restaurant. What kind of restaurant is not wheelchair accessible?", "NTA shit move by your friends to go somewhere they know you can\u2019t. I just don\u2019t think you can compare a physical disability to being vegetarian. Might want to think about branching out with some new friends.", "NTA. My cousin is in a wheelchair. When I lived with him, we always made it work. Inaccessibility was just out of the question (also ignorant of the business owner in my opinion) every food place has SOMETHING a vegetarian can eat, not every food place is accessible. He was just doing that to exclude you.", "NTA. I went to steakhouses w/ friends when I was a vegetarian. I ate a baked potato and soup or some related combo. If he were vegan, that is a different story. That just is not the same as a place being wheelchair inaccessible and it is really rude to compare the two.", "no offense, but you friends are shit. I personally would never go to a nye party meant for friends that excludes someone like this. James chose to be vegan, you didnt choose to be in a wheelchair, so his whole \"its the same\" attitude is so gross. NTA", "NTA. There are vegetarian options everywhere you go. Some might not be great (I have ordered 3 sides of fries, corn on the cob and steamed veggie plate once) but there are options. Not being able to even get into the restaurant is not giving you an option at all and excluding you. For your \"friends\" to go along with them excluding you, says a lot about them.", "NTA.  But I don't think the problem is James, but your roommates.  They didn't take your disability and your presence, as part of the group into consideration.   They don't see you as part of the tight knit group.", "NTA Many others have commented why James sucks but I\u2019m side eyeing all of your friends as well.

In what regard do the accessibility options vary between the two locations?", "Thanks for pointing this out. I have managed a few restaurants, half in historic buildings and the other half in (less older, but still dated architecturally) venues that we renovated. We did our damndest to make things accessible, but on occasion sometimes it was impossible. Eg the lift in our heritage building would only accomodate wheelchairs with XX cm width, and the only solution to this was to build an external lift which just frankly was not on the cards for financial and planning reasons - bear in mind we were rental tenants as well, so this was at the discretion of our landlord. Many of our clients simply were not able to book  the upper venues because they weren't adequately inclusive (on the small chance a ticket holder would require such accomodations.) Frankly, this likelihood was tiny but obviously it was a necessary decision to book elsewhere and we would make recommendations. I wish our world was more inclusive, but I'm glad to see that laws and council regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent in mandating appropriate accommodations. \n\nAs for people saying the hippie vego place should be more inclusive and have appropriate accomodations.. I'm just going to share a harsh reality. Hospo is a slim margin, and start up costs are huge. If it's their first venue, it is likely they had to settle for a venue with low rental overheads, but likely did include certain setbacks eg no ground floor access, footpath trading, lift access etc. A shitty compromise is that individuals can get takeaway, and I hope to god they'd be super gracious in preparing you an extra delicious meal because, as a server, it's super embarrassing when you fail to accomodate individuals with disabilities.

They are typically small businesses that moved into existing buildings with stairs to enter, and in which ramps, elevators, or lifts cannot be installed without great expense or imposition on public space. Take, for example, Toki Underground (which is ironically named because it is on an upper floor), which is a great ramen restaurant. They are situated on the second floor of what used to be a residential building. There's another business below them, which also does not have a level entry. They'd have to work with the other business, the landlord, and the city to install an accessible entryway into another business, and an elevator to take customers to their space, to be fully ADA compliant. The ADA does not require that of small businesses!\n\nIf you are dining with someone who cannot access a space, you should be mindful of that, but not every business, even in the US, is required to be fully accessible.", "Yes and no. So I\u2019ve been to the steakhouse before. It\u2019s a nice place, and the staff are very friendly, but the entrance is quite tight, and so is the distance between tables.

It\u2019s a bit frustrating when restaurants have the high booths, as I\u2019m more comfortable personally staying in my chair. But for me that\u2019s also negotiable. And bathrooms.

Some restaurants I could go to without any accommodation, I\u2019d consider that highly accessible. For something where they\u2019d have to move things, I can\u2019t use the bathroom, or I have to leave my chair to sit, I\u2019d consider that less accessible, but obviously still doable.

Your friends really need to watch some TED talks on ableism and unconscious bias. Maybe even white fragility because some of those concepts might translate to this scenario as well. Your home should be your safe space, no bigots allowed. Your roommates need to come around to supporting and respecting you as a fellow human being, and step up with J&C. \n\n*\n \nSo a couple things. 100% you\u2019re NTA. Like\u2026 for goodness sake, in what universe would not wanting to be around people who excluded you for *any* avoidable reason not be ok? \n \nI have ADHD which is not generally a mobility disability (I say generally because let\u2019s be honest I fall down far more than an adult human should because I\u2019m not watching where I\u2019m stepping, please take that as a self deprecating attempt at humor because I\u2019m really mad on your behalf and that\u2019s how I cope \ud83d\ude05). But it means there are restaurants that flat out make my skin crawl. *Can* I go to a sports bar in the evening when my meds are wearing off? Sure. Physically I can be present in a sports bar. But mentally? Mentally my entire brain is slowly filling up with bees and I\u2019m trying to figure out what level of alcohol is needed to drown them but not also black out myself. I can\u2019t hold a conversation. I have no notion of how much time has passed since my eyes became superglued to a random sportsball game on a TV. My ears are full of noise but none of it sounds like words that friends are saying around me. 50/50 if I\u2019ll notice if my friends wander off. \n \nThat type of place is a no go for me. And do you know what happens when a new friend or acquaintance suggests it? I say \u201cI can\u2019t, my ADHD can\u2019t take it.\u201d And they say \u201cOk what about a dive bar?\u201d Which is fine. I just can\u2019t take sportsball on screens in every direction and crowd/announcer noise coming out of speakers. \n \nOr my friends immediately say *they* don\u2019t want to go there, even though I *know* they don\u2019t care either way. Just because they know I won\u2019t go if that\u2019s where the group is going. \n \nAnd *my* disability is invisible and routinely discounted and meme\u2019d to hell and back. \n\nYou deserve better friends. Flat out. \n \nYou deserve better friends and better roommates and I\u2019m sorry they weren\u2019t better for you in that moment. \n \nOk here\u2019s an ADHD thinking while typing 60 wpm on a smart phone stream of consciousness list. Please feel free not to read it. Also feel free to send it as divine retribution to C&J and force them to read it and all it\u2019s mis-punctuated glory. \ud83d\ude1c\n \n1) Like, (very respectfully) remove the reason you couldn\u2019t go and replace it with literally any other reason that is not health related and your friends would probably not think it\u2019s ok to exclude you like this. And if they *did* think it was ok, then you\u2019d feel completely justified for setting a boundary and refusing to allow them to then hang out in your house. A disability is a protected class, correct? So is sexual orientation. If the Thai place discriminated against gay men and wouldn\u2019t serve them, how would Chris and James react if your friend group decided to go there anyways on NYE and told them tough luck but you\u2019d bring them take out? Or if the steakhouse wouldn\u2019t serve POC? Or the  health food place only served men? \n \nYour friends would blow and absolute gasket over the prejudice and injustice of it, and they sure as hell wouldn\u2019t be friends with anyone who was fine with it and ditched them to go there. \n \n2) Your friends need to look up casual ableism, and also to read this entire post and all the replies. \n \n3) I also think they need someone to point out to them in very strong terms how prejudice and absolutely able bodied privileged they\u2019re acting. If they need a reference point out to them it\u2019s like white privilege, where they have it but since it\u2019s not smacking them in the face they\u2019ve been able to fool themselves into thinking they don\u2019t. Might be best if someone else points that out to them, maybe a mutual friend? Otherwise they sound like they\u2019re dismissing your *VERY REAL AND VALID CONCERNS* as what? You were upset about food? Which is *not* the issue. \n\n4. They need to deep dive into their own brains and root that crap out, just like many of us have to root out other unconscious biases and prejudices. Having a bias, prejudice, or a long held belief that you\u2019re not fully cognizant of doesn\u2019t make someone a bad person or an AH. But if someone points it out and you don\u2019t stop, listen, go away and really ponder it to see if there\u2019s any validity to what they said, research if you need to, ask questions, etc before deciding whether or not you have that bias or prejudice and what to do about it? That makes you an AH. \n \n5. This is me, as an elder millennial saying to Gen Z \u201cThat\u2019s some boomer shit right there. Do better.\u201d \n \n6. I think once things calm down you should sit down with your immediate roommates and set some boundaries. Ask them if you can calmly talk about it. Start by basically saying exactly what you said in your post. Then ask them what their impression of what happened with the restaurant was. And THEN what they thought about how you handled things afterwards. I\u2019d try very hard to appear to be the calm, reasonable one (even though I think you have every right to throw things in this situation). Take the high ground, enlist their empathy (not sympathy but empathy), and support. Remind them that everyone deserves respect, especially friends, and what happened with the restaurant was very disrespectful and hurtful. \n\nThen I think you need to clearly state that bigots are not welcome in your home, no matter what form they take or what their own identities are. It is *your* home as well as theirs, and your safe space too. Point out to them that you\u2019re not trying to control who they hang out with, if they choose to hang out with bigots they\u2019re adults and you can\u2019t stop them. But that does not mean you have to tolerate their presence. \n \nHowever depending on how your roommates take that conversation, if they still want to be friends and hang out with Chris and James and you want to salvage some kind of working, respectful relationship with them, then I\u2019d ask them for their help. See if your roommates are willing and able to explain things in a way that C and J will hear and listen to. Or conversely, tell C and J to eff off until they grow up. \n \nNTA.

I am livid at the idea that there was a vote and the inaccessible place won.", ">You have every right to stand your ground\n\n... phrasing? =D \n\nNTA OP. I agree with the point being made here.", "Yeah, that was my immediate thought. I am vegetarian and have no problem going to steakhouses because I can easily load up on sides and salad. \n\nThis was just a straight-up dick move. \n\nOP is NTA but everyone in the friend group definitely is", "I'm a vegetarian my fam isn't. I'm also disabled. There is always veggie options at steakhouses. Mainly because of the rise in popularity of being a vegetarian tbh. And accessibility is a must within friend groups.", "Everybody has salad. Side note -  aren\u2019t all businesses required to be wheel chair accessible?", "I've been to numerous steak houses. One of my best friends is a vegetarian and her boyfriend is vegan. They happily joined us at a steakhouse for Christmas Eve dinner.  There is creamed spinach, steak house mushrooms (no steak included) salads, usually pasta and artichoke dip. \n\nPlus most chefs at a steakhouse will make a meat free pasta if requested. \n\nAll you need is a modicum of intelligence and you can eat at a steakhouse \n\nHonestly OP all your friends are AHs. I'd never leave a friend who used a wheelchair home alone on a holiday and go to an inaccessible restaurant.", "Been a vegetarian for most of my life and have always hated steak. But if it\u2019s a celebration and I have to go to a steakhouse, I shut up and go and enjoy the goddamn night", "Steakhouses often have pretty decent (sometimes great) vegetarian and vegan options, because they know that not offering those options is a substantial barrier to entry for many people.", "As a vegetarian, I usually have better luck at steakhouses than, say, diners. Steakhouses tend to have good salads and veggies, but at diners I\u2019m usually stuck with breakfast for dinner because if they have a salad it\u2019s gross and the sides are usually no better. So it\u2019s breakfast either in the form of sugary carbs (pancakes/waffles) or eggs with toast and/or potatoes.\n\nBut I\u2019ve never been anywhere that didn\u2019t have SOMETHING I could eat. Even if it\u2019s a combo plate of sides. Cracker Barrel came the closest, but even then I could get breakfast food.\n\nVegans probably have a different experience, but 1. Most places do have vegan options to some extent and 2. The guy in this story isn\u2019t vegan anyway.", "Exactly. I could eat Thai every day for a week because I hate having to decide just one thing. What should I have today? Yellow curry? Hmmm. Pineapple fried rice? No. Tom Ka ramen? Maybe. Pad Thai? No, maybe red curry today? Maybe just appetizers? Shrimp spring rolls? Tofu fries with peanut sauce? I mean, I always choose two and take home leftovers because I can't decide.", "Especially in a small college town with only three viable restaurant options", "Sometimes there\u2019s a pretty wide definition of accessible. In my country everything should be accessible, but at the front door of my building there are a set of stairs and no ramp. I enquired about this as I had a toddler in a pram and was told we could use the parking access (about 100 feet away from the front door, requiring a remote) which also requires you to go through a set of double doors. Hard enough with a pram, impossible in a wheelchair, but ticked the accessibility rulebook boxes, apparently.", "Can confirm,  family owns 3 buildings that are in the historic building register locally,  we can't even make the windows more insulating(in the fucking fridge north)  let alone anything that would make the buildings more accessible. All in they're not terrible,  inconvenient and one harder to manage than the others,  but absolutely nothing can be changed.", "Yeah, I live in an old city, inner city has a lot of late medieval buildings still. (And everything between medieval and today.) A lot of effort goes into trying for accessibility, but it's not always an option when you also want to keep the monumental buildings. A lot of the streets are narrow, so ramps etc. wouldn't even fit, while also keeping the street wheelchair accessible. Bathrooms especially tend to be in the basements or upstairs, which doesn't work for wheelchair users. \n\nOf course when remodeling they should always try for the very best accessibility that is possible.", "> Could you just ask for some other oil?\n\nnot usually, no. most restaurant fryers use gallons of oil and changing it out isn't quick or easy.", "This is what I don't get. Why was the inaccessible place even in the mix? If they added it to appease a new person in the group, then why did any of the old friends vote for it?\n\nAnd worst of all, they are now saying OP is overreacting. They should be apologizing!", "I don\u2019t understand how my friend takes allergy meds every single day for his cat allergy. He loves his wife and the cat so much.", "There is! And a vegan version of coxinha, too", "My in laws (for good reason) - one is very spice intolerant (black pepper is spicy) and one is allergic to coconut, so there\u2019d be limited options and they\u2019re just not used to eating it. They\u2019d still go rather than exclude someone and would find something!", "I don't but that's because I can barely handle the most mild of spices. But if the option was Thai vs a place a friend couldn't go at all, I'd still go to thai place and try to find sth I could eat. Or just, eat later?", "Unless The building it\u2019s located in is on the historical society registry and/or built before 1954\n\nThat\u2019s most likely why that spot isn\u2019t accessible \n\nOtherwise that\u2019s a federal lawsuit and the find would run the out of business", "So much more to eat, yummy!", "That's what you see when you eat the magic mushies"]}
