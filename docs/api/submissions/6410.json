I (M21) am disabled, full time wheelchair user, and live in a fairly small college town with a couple friends. My roommates and I are part of a larger friend group of 8 people, and I\u2019d say we\u2019re all pretty close. I really love my roommates, they\u2019re great, but sometimes a little thick. There\u2019s one person in the large friend group, let\u2019s call him Chris, who is dating a guy, let\u2019s call him James. I really don\u2019t like James for many reason, mostly petty ones to be honest. But another fact, James is vegetarian. That\u2019s not a problem in itself, but Herein comes the issue. \n\nAll of us planned on getting dinner on New Year\u2019s Eve. Smallish college town, there are three main restaurants to choose from that are open in the nearby area. One of them is a steakhouse, one of them is a Thai place, one of them is a sort of hippie plant-based place. James immediately suggests the plant-based one. I give a veto, as it\u2019s completely inaccessible, and give the alternative of ordering take-out from there and bringing it back to my place. But we recently started fostering a cat, and one of our other friends is allergic to cats, so that\u2019s also a no-go. \n\nNone of the other friends are able to host a gathering for various reasons, so I suggest we go to the Thai place. It\u2019s a nice spot, and reasonably accessible. But apparently James and Chris went to the Thai place last week for their anniversary, and don\u2019t want to go back. I then suggest the steakhouse, but of course that is loudly shut down because James is a vegetarian. \n\nLong story short, the group did a vote between the hippie place and the Thai place, not even including the steakhouse, and the plant-based place won. I admitted that I was slightly frustrated to my roommates, who said that they can bring food back after. I said that that wasn\u2019t the issue, but sure. \n\nSo New Year\u2019s Eve comes and they get back from dinner, and James and Chris also stop by. At this point it\u2019s pretty late and I\u2019m a couple drinks in, and I flat out tell James that I think it\u2019s shitty that he suggested and then subsequently campaigned for a place that he knows that I can\u2019t go to. He said that it\u2019s fair because I suggested the steakhouse, knowing he\u2019s a vegetarian. I told him that it\u2019s different, because he could have at the very least physically been present. He insisted that it\u2019s the same, and I asked him to leave the apartment because I was I was tired of dealing with his bullshit. \n\nSo he left, and my roommates think I overreacted. Maybe I did.

Him being vegetarian and you being *physically unable to access the restaurant* are completely different things.

You gave plenty of options, and they specifically chose the one that directly excluded you.", "NTA - James' diet is his choice, you being disabled is not. He could have gotten a salad at the steakhouse, or he and Chris could have sucked it up and gone to the Thai place once more.\n\nThey literally decided that eating at the same restaurant twice in two weeks was worse than having you around. Chris and James majorly suck, but your other friends aren't much better for going along with this. Also, one or two people could have decided to skip the restaurant and stay with you.\n\nThese people aren't good friends.", "NTA. Who the hell cares that they went to the Thai place last week? They can go again. It's a small college town! Not like there's a whole range of options here. The other people who also voted for the vegetarian place share some blame too.\n\nSide note: as long as you keep calling it a hippie place, you're never going to win people over.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, most steakhouses have vegetarian options. In the very worst case, he could have gotten a salad and a drink.\n\nYou could not physically get in the chosen restaurant.\n\nHe is not the only asshole though, all of your friends are.", "INFO:  when you say the plant based restaurant was \"inaccessible\" do you mean \"Wheel Chair Accessible\"?  As in, \"you are not physically able to go into the restaurant\".\n\nIf that be the case the your friends are major AH's here.  Why would they pick a restaurant that you physically cannot go into?  Being vegetarian, by the most part, is a choice.  Being in a wheelchair isn't.  It's not rocket science.", "NTA. There's plenty of vegetarian options at steak houses too. James isn't your friend so he doesn't owe you anything BUT it's really shitty of your friends to go along with that and vote for a place knowing it'll exclude you. You need better friends.", "Nta. Vegetarianism is a choice. Wheelchair access is not. My partner is deathly allergic to peanuts.and cannot even enter a Thai restaurant. That's super different from food preferences, ability equity is non-negotiable. Sucks you have to deal with this ignorance.", "NTA. You have every right to stand your ground and to not have to tolerate the company who has no interest in your wellbeing. \n\nAlso, the fact that your friends found that his vegetarianism was a more significant ultimatum than your accessibility (going to a place he likely couldn't eat was completely off the table whereas a place you absolutely physically cannot enter was acceptable enough not only to be put to a vote but also to be voted for) says something very unfavourable about your circle of friends. Dietary stuff is difficult to arrange but I cant imagine my group of friends even considering a place that someone couldn't get into due to disability. I'm horrified by this kind of prioritisation to be quite honest, let alone that the compromise that would suit you both was voted against just because they've been there recently.", "NTA but I find it strange that none of your friends stood up for you. They were happier to not have you rather than forcing a vegetarian to eat fries at stakehouse\n\nEither your friends really dislike you for reasons not related to this post or they are so thick that you should look for better company", "Here\u2019s my problem, while James may have suggested it, all of your roommates were the ones who voted towards the plant based restaurant. No one stood up for you, and everyone decided to go there, rather than going to a more accessible restaurant or splitting into two groups so that everyone could go where they wanted to, and then reconvene somewhere else. So I would say NTA, but you\u2019re directing all of your anger at James, who only suggested the place, rather than your \u201cfriends\u201d who all decided to go there and leave you behind. Just something to think about.", "NTA. The thai place was an excellent compromise and I\u2019m horrified that your friends chose a place you couldn\u2019t access, instead. James sounds like a tool.", "NTA, but you might want to consider where your \u201cfriends\u201d decided to go, even knowing you would be left out.", "NTA. What would infuriate me the most is that everyone (including the other friends) chose to go to the restaurant you physically couldn\u2019t go to even after you brought up that point. And then the fact James brought up that you suggested the steak house which wasn\u2019t even part of what they voted on is ridiculous.", "Lol what? You have a physical disability that literally makes you unable to access the restaurant. He chooses to be vegetarian. How are those the same thing when one is a CHOICE? He could have got Thai one more time or some side dishes at the steakhouse but he deliberately chose a place where you are unable to enter. He is the AH and your friends who chose the same restaurant are also AH. I wouldn\u2019t even accept a restaurant without accessibility to be in the list. Period.", "Nta. It's pretty rude to purposefully exclude someone because of a disability just because they don't want to be around people eating meat", "NTA\n\nYour friends are AHs and so is that restaurant. What kind of restaurant is not wheelchair accessible?", "NTA shit move by your friends to go somewhere they know you can\u2019t. I just don\u2019t think you can compare a physical disability to being vegetarian. Might want to think about branching out with some new friends.", "NTA. My cousin is in a wheelchair. When I lived with him, we always made it work. Inaccessibility was just out of the question (also ignorant of the business owner in my opinion) every food place has SOMETHING a vegetarian can eat, not every food place is accessible. He was just doing that to exclude you.", "NTA. I went to steakhouses w/ friends when I was a vegetarian. I ate a baked potato and soup or some related combo. If he were vegan, that is a different story. That just is not the same as a place being wheelchair inaccessible and it is really rude to compare the two.", "no offense, but you friends are shit. I personally would never go to a nye party meant for friends that excludes someone like this. James chose to be vegan, you didnt choose to be in a wheelchair, so his whole \"its the same\" attitude is so gross. NTA", "NTA. There are vegetarian options everywhere you go. Some might not be great (I have ordered 3 sides of fries, corn on the cob and steamed veggie plate once) but there are options. Not being able to even get into the restaurant is not giving you an option at all and excluding you. For your \"friends\" to go along with them excluding you, says a lot about them.", "NTA.  But I don't think the problem is James, but your roommates.  They didn't take your disability and your presence, as part of the group into consideration.   They don't see you as part of the tight knit group.", "NTA Many others have commented why James sucks but I\u2019m side eyeing all of your friends as well.
