Either you have a medical problem, you\u2019re not getting enough sleep, or you\u2019re  setting your alarm for the wrong part of your sleep cycle because you're skimping on sleep.

As a health care professional, how do you not understand her situation?", "My trick to not sleeping through alarms is to switch up the alarm ringtone often. I\u2019ll have a different ringtone for every other day, or every day. There are also apps like Sleep Cycle, which I use, which supposedly track your sleep to wake you up within a ~30 minute interval when your sleep is lightest, so you wake up more easily. If I need to be up at 7, I\u2019ll set sleep cycle to wake me up at some point between 6:30-7, and I\u2019ll have a backup for 7:05 using Alarmy (which makes you perform an activity like math or a puzzle before you can turn the alarm off of snooze mode) or a general alarm.

Extremely hard to wake up.\n\nA couple of things that helped him was every couple of days changing what his alarm sounded like.

Timers are cheap.", "YTA. \n\nIt seems like you never properly learned how to wake up on your own (I learned this at 9 years old, getting up with my own alarm, getting dressed, making breakfast and walking to school on my own.

We were on vacation together for 4 weeks. Her alarm went off on the highest volume for 30-60 seconds. I usually woke up bit earlier so I was awake when her alarm went off.

As a teen I waken up for years with alarm smashed on the wall, and no memory of anything (alarm clock was literally a budget for me).\n\nIt was so frustrating to be unable to wake up as easily as others.

But the fact that your alarm goes off in the afternoon, she can chill a little", "ESH. Have you tried sleeping after Rem cycles? I sleep deep with sleep apnea and I find it easiest to wake up at the end of a cycle. I have phone and metal alarms a few steps from my head with aluminum behind to have the sounds bounce. \n\nCount up 1 hour and 30 min until you get to roughly how much you wake up. I saw you said 7 hours. Try to time it for 7 hours and 30 minutes. \n\nSet your alarms for 7 hours and 30 minutes ahead (I put 10/20 min more to allow for me to pass out for the above amount of time). That's how long you sleep for. If you need less take away 1 hour 30. \n\nIt should get you to the stage closest to waking up. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA, people who can't sleep through an alarm simply don't understand. Mine goes off for an hour and I've slept through the whole thing before.", "I too am a VERY deep sleeper.  I found a great alarm that has an attachment that goes under my pillow and vibrates.  It works great for me.", "NTA the alarm was going for 3 minutes in the afternoon!!

I used to have multiple alarms going off at random times in the morning & not hear any of them. My sister\u2019s a really light sleeper and would get progressively more annoyed every time she had to wake me up to turn off my alarms which made me recognise what a shitty human I was being. Honestly, if she decided to pour water on me I\u2019d be pissed too so nta there. \n\nI found that if I needed to wake up early the next day, I would just go to bed really early the previous day so I would more likely to hear my alarm.

He sleeps through his alarm and if I don't wake him, the alarm can go on for 10 mins.

It works so much better than an alarm. ESH.", "NTA because this is common with nighttime shift nurses and workers. Also she could have just turned the alarm off, you can\u2019t read texts in your sleep.  Not sure why this part got ignored, I would absolutely flip out if someone woke me up this way. I get it was her last straw, pregnancy brain is something else, but it\u2019s not intentional. I got a daylight alarm and it helps me a lot! This may be a side effect of working longer hours as a nightshirt nurse as well. We had a parent that still hadn\u2019t picked up their kid from daycare an hour past close so we sent a welfare check for her. Her alarm was still ringing from the three hours prior she literally couldn\u2019t hear it. The police officers knocking didn\u2019t wake her up. The only thing that did was her husband coming home from work after we alerted him to the situation and him going inside to wake her up which still took a few minutes. She obviously was super apologetic and made a plan in case this happened again. She had worked a double and her body just crashed. People forget how important sleep is in terms of brain function and the fact that it can literally kill you if you go days without it or even just not getting enough sleep. Some studies suggest iirc that going from 8 to 4 hours create a sleep deficit that takes weeks to correct. I would go to the doctor to find out if there is something that is impacting your health or overall sleep. This could also help with work being more accommodating as well. Don\u2019t be afraid to take sick days relating to this, sleep is part of your health too. I have been like this since I was in high school. Being awake 12 hour days for years basically fried my sleep. I went to bed at 8pm-9pm and woke up at 7 am all of elementary-middle school bc of strict parenting to sleeping in like this. In college before COVID I bounced back and could easily pull all nighters and go from activities to jobs and then wake for my 7 am job or class. Also COVID ruined everyone\u2019s sleep schedules and routines and you may be recovering from that as well. I went to summer camp in high school they couldn\u2019t get me awake for a half hour and when I did I knocked over my entire nightstand including a cup of tea because I was so disoriented. Just this week I got only 6 hours and my body decided with my busy schedule it had enough. This meant I literally slept through my alarm and my mom coming to my house knocking on my door for a few minutes. I\u2019m also at the doctors currently to see what I can do to fix this. There\u2019s several theories, thyroid issues, viruses, ect. I wish people were more understanding with this, sleep deprivation is up there with impaired driving for leading causes of accidents. People assume laziness when often it\u2019s health or even lifestyle/job related instead. If they can understand when people are sick, they can understand this. Best of luck! :)", "NAH\n\nJust incompatibility and unfortunate circumstances. I'm glad I don't sleep that deeply; it sounds terrible.", "You're just gonna sleep through the bed shaking.

He could be snoring and completely in Lala land whilst his alarm was going through his speakers at full blast until someone else would go in and turn it off for him and then basically have to pry his eyes open in order to wake him\n\nIt was actually a huge fear of the rest of the family that he wouldn\u2019t wake up in case of the fire alarm or an emergency \n\nI understand your sisters frustration as I\u2019ve been on the far far far worst receiving end of my brothers inability to wake up to an alarm.

There\u2019s no reason to throw water on someone who\u2019s sleeping except to be an AH. If you were layed there staring at your phone whilst the alarm went off then that would be different but until you\u2019ve walked into a room with an unconscious person whilst their speakers are going at full blast then it\u2019s impossible to comment and actually have a valid opinion", "Eh, ESH on this one. \n\nI don't know the Science behind whatever it is that prevents you from waking up to an alarm.

I don't make a lot of money so I want to wait until I get my next paycheck to buy something. \n\nMy alarm went off earlier this afternoon at 4:40.

You should wake after less than ten seconds of someone shaking you.", "Oh ok. \n\n1. If you were to move out, would she be able to pay the rent on her own? Because if not, then you guys have a common problem and you could ask her to participate in some way.\n\n2. Could she wake you up like Donald Duck in that old cartoon where Mickey, Goofy and Donald goes camping in a caravan? Donald has an alarm clock that winds up his blanket and slaps his feet with the end. I'm just trying to brainstorm here and this is what my mind came up with :-D \n\n3. Could you start your sleep time earlier? I know my kids are horrible to wake up, but if I put them to bed 30 minutes eatlier, it is a whole different situation in the morning.\n\nI understand this is a very difficult situation for both you and your sister.

The only thing you have mentioned is your \u201cloud alarm\u201d you bought before moving in, and that same loud alarm still bothering your sister since you moved in 1.5 yrs ago?", "Okay, that's a rough one for sure. Is there any way you can ask for advice via work (you said you work in Healthcare?), or save up for external help?", "you should try aiming for longer sleep times. it helped me to have a time where i was in bed and ready to sleep, with a solid routine before work. i was never a breakfast person (i only had breakfast as a kid because my parents didn\u2019t give me that choice), but for the sake of a routine, i started eating.\n\nit made it easier to roll out of bed because i wasn\u2019t simply rolling out of bed and rushing to get ready for work, i was rolling out of bed to eat, maybe shower, with time to spare to watch an episode or two of a 20 minute sitcom, then getting ready for work.\n\nit takes time and commitment, and a lot of experimenting with different methods, but it\u2019s worth it. especially if you want a peaceful home life. if you\u2019re bothered by your sister\u2019s reactions to your heavy sleeping now, it\u2019s likely only going to get worse once the baby\u2019s born, because she\u2019s going to have to sleep when the baby sleeps, and you\u2019ll have two unhappy campers instead of one because of your alarm.", "That's tough. Yeah, trying finding a sleep specialist. Maybe there's something you could try to improve your quality of sleep and/or make it easier to fall asleep quickly. Melatonin is worth a try, and hell, Ambien exists.\n\nAlso, if you unwind by watching a show or scrolling on your phone, that's going to make it harder to fall asleep. Look up blue light from screens and how it blocks melatonin production in the brain.\n\nGood luck - I used to be that person who slept through long alarms, so while your sister is right to be frustrated, I also get how frustrating this is for you.", "Most of the apps on teh samsung watch are also available on android phones, so op doesn't even need the watch, just the apps", "My insurance won't cover it", "With what money?", "That is for a studio.", "Must be nice.", "My insurance won't cover it.", "I understand its inconsiderate and rude.

I've already listed all of that.", "this is super common in people with ADHD.\n\nI had a roommate once who wanted to murder me because i set alarms to go off every 5 minutes, with the most obnoxious sounds I can finde, until I wake up.  And I would sleep thru that shit for an hour.  \n\n\nThe the thing that has helped me the most is taking guanfacine at night.
