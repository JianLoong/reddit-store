I currently work at a small company and spend most of my time working in a \"cubicle farm.\" The pay is good, but unfortunately the furniture sucks. The company gave us some pretty trash chairs to sit on.\n\nMy colleague Randy (35?M; I think he's about my age), one day just has this new office chair: a Herman Miller Aeron. From what I understand, this is one of the nicest chairs on the market.\n\nFor the next week, I'm green with envy that he's sitting on this throne of a cubicle chair, until I eventually crack and ask him how he got this chair.\n\nRandy told me that he got it through HR. He said that HR offers various accommodations for people with disabilities or mobility issues.\n\nI'm a bit surprised. Randy is a bigger fellow, but I didn't think he had a disability. So I ask him what he said he had to get this chair. He said he was able to get it because of obesity. I ask him as respectfully as I can how much he weighs, and he said he weighs 235.\n\nI visit HR and ask about this. They said that if someone brings a doctor's note saying their BMI is in the obese category, they can provide this accommodation. \n\nInfo: I don't exactly have abs, but I don't think anyone would consider me obese by conventional means. However, I weigh almost as much as Randy, most likely because I've been lifting weights for 20 years. I'm 5'9 and weigh 205 with a 32 inch waist. This puts my BMI at 30.3, which is obese on paper.\n\nI go to my doctor to ask for a note about my BMI. He definitely gives me a look, but he obliges me. I bring it to HR, do the paperwork, and after a little time, success! I am now sitting on a Herman Miller Aeron. \n\nRandy quickly notices my new chair and asks me what happened. I told him the entire series of events, and he becomes irritated. He said I'm exploiting the HR policy and (in workplace code) called me an asshole. \n\nI think I need a second opinion from AITA because I followed all of HR's rules; albeit with a little problem solving.

How can that possibly effect Randy?  NTA.  The real asshole is your employer.  Herman Miller Aeron chairs are extremely expensive for an individual to buy, but for a company that runs a cubicle farm, it's just another line item on a balance sheet.  There's no reason they can't make all of their employees comfortable while they make the company money.", "NTA. BMI is a silly way to measure people (as your story proves), and if your company has built a policy around it, then good on you for exploiting it.", "I work in HR and I say NTA. Their policy is ridiculous, but that isn\u2019t your fault.", "NTA.\n\nTheir policy is stupid - BMI is a broken system and they are stupid for following it this way. and 235? C'mon. That's only a disability if he is 5'5\"  He was doing the same thing.", "NTA\n\nOh please please please post this to r/maliciouscompliance", "NTA.\n\nIt's literally the company's workplace policy.\n\nYou followed the rules. He's probably pissed more people will use it.", "I'm going to say NTA. You have every right to do this since you're going by the book. If they were standard chairs it's one thing, but if they are trash and uncomfortable heck with them!\n\nI would say no AH here but your coworker has no right to be upset at what you did. You meet the criteria just like he does.", "NTA. And as former HR, I find this hilarious.", "NTA - I do think in general exploiting a policy in place to make the workplace accessible for disabled workers sucks. But only if the policy is not ridiculous.\n\nIn this instance, a proper desk assessment and appropriate equipment so you\u2019re not in discomfort shouldn't be just considered a reasonable accommodation for disabled workers, it should automatically be done for all staff.\n\nYes, we should get reasonable accommodations to make the workplace accessible (I do), but generally speaking, that will require more than a nice chair", "NTA. You played their game and got the chair. Wtf does he care if you're also comfortable???", "NTA. Good on you for showing how dumb BMI is. Lol. If the policy says obese on paper is good enough for a nice chair, then you enjoy that nice chair", "NTA. HR is The Great Satan.", "Re: getting a chair? NTA. You're following their rule, didn't make doctor lie or anything, not taking anything away from a disabled person.\n\n  \nBut as a disabled person - if someone who is just a colleague and doesn't even know my age asked for more personal info after I said something was due to disability accommodation, I would be in an awkward situation. Obviously he felt fine answering in this case and I don't mean you're a total dick for it, I get it wasn't malicious. but imo it is good practice to leave it at that unless the person volunteers it. I have an invisible disability and it gets a bit tiring when your real answer is something that immediately turns the mood to shit, I get to choose between being dumping that on someone I don't know or awkwardly being like sorry I don't want to tell you", "NTA\n\n\nErgonomic seating is a basic tool required for office work.  The company is the asshole for not providing this by default.", "NTA. Just one more example of BMI being a BS measurement, but if you get a better chair out of it... why not!?", "NTA\n\nTrash office chairs are a health hazard. If this is the game you have to play not to work in pain, you aren\u2019t an asshole for playing it.", "NTA.  Honestly, any employer that isn't proactively looking out for the ergonomic setup for their workers is just asking for trouble.  Ergonomic injuries are OSHA recordable depending on the severity.  I work as a manager in a lab environment - we do ergonomic assessments on office setups and lab setups at least annually or more often if anyone thinks they may be having an ergonomic issue.\n\nYes, you are somewhat exploiting policy, but should be in a decent ergonomic chair regardless.", "NTA it's a chair not a handicap parking spot. Plus you getting it doesn't negatively effect anyone nor their chances of doing the same thing", "NTA -\nSometimes you've got to do what you've got to do for comfort so that you can work comfortably so that is bearable.\n\nPlus technically as defined by BMI you are obese.\n\nThe thing is uncomfortable furniture and sitting long time on uncomfortable furniture can obviously have negative health implications for the discs in your back. Your pelvis you tailbone.\nIn an ideal world your workplace should provide furniture that's  comfortable for you to sit down and work without discomfort", "NTA. According to the BMI scale you are obese.", "NTA - you could have literally told your doctor that your back was hurting from your terrible chair and gotten the same note though.", "NTA you followed procedure.", "NTA\n\nYou did exactly what he did and got the same results. He cannot be mad at you doing this without being a hypocrite.", "You are exploiting the hr policy, but I think you're NTA for it", "NTA - you followed the HR policy to get comfortable seating. Randy is the AH if he thinks you have no right to be comfortable because you have no disability or mobility issues.", "NTA. Not your fault that BMI is bullshit or that your employer has chosen to use it in their policy.", "NTA, just playing the BS game", "You got the required documents, did you convince your doc to lie? \n\nReally everyone should have ergonomic and comfy chairs so NTA either way. Good for you.", "NTA.  Policy is policy.", "NTA. Surely there are 1,000 other valid reasons you could ask for a better chair. Lower back pain, upper back pain, posture support, carpal tunnel, achey breaks pelvis, etc.", "NTA. Your ergonomic health is worth 1500 to you and the company.", "NTA HR is just making sure the don't  get sued for ADA violations. Meanwhile everyone else gets substandard working conditions.", "NTA.\n\nA good chair that provides proper support for an eight-hour cubicle job shouldn't be considered a special accommodation; it should simply be the baseline for all employees. An Aeron chair should last for 10+ years; $1,000 amortized over 10 years is only $100/year, or about $2/pay period. If you consider that improper support can lead to long-term injuries that require sick days, surgeries or more to address, then you can even make the argument that the chairs would save the company money in the long run.\n\nAnd if you can argue that the chair makes it easier to work longer and be more productive, then it becomes even more baffling why all staff don't have those chairs.\n\nBut regardless - you're NTA for complying with HR guidelines in order to improve your work environment.", "NTA. The real AH here is your job for this policy. You\u2019re definitely exploiting the policy but it\u2019s their fault for creating a policy than can be so easily exploited. However asking Randy for details regarding what he told HR to get the chair was inappropriate. It doesn\u2019t matter if you two get along well. Information like that should only be volunteered.", "You know how workers become disabled? Shitty working conditions. Good, supportive chairs, ergonomic desks, etc should be standard so that workers aren't getting injured. You're NTA but your company is for cheaping out on office furniture.", "From one wage slave to another, you\u2019re NTA. Exploit all the policies because they definitely exploit you. It\u2019s sad your coworker is directing that ire at you and not the boss forcing y\u2019all to work in painful cheap chairs in the first place. Oh well.", "NTA. HR policies are often dumb and should be exploited. Everyone deserves comfortable chairs, and it's not like what you did negatively impacts Randy.", "I'd say \"soft\" YTA because you are abusing a policy intended for people with disabilities and mobility issues (also disabilities can be invisible so Randy might have problems derived from his obesity). That being said, you followed policy so technically it is on the company to have the right criteria for mobility aids (BMI definitely not being one) and they should not use disability as an excuse to give everyone else shitty chairs, so enjoy your fancy chair and destroy corporate BS.", "NTA employer should be providing reasonable accommodations for comfort throughout the workday. A shitty chair can absolutely wreck your back when you're sitting in it all day.", "YTA -  what will happen, is more people will do this.  Then the company will change the policy and make it harder.  So really the people who lose will be the people who need the consideration.\n\nIt also contributes to the idea that people with disabilities are all faking and lying about it.  ESPECIALLY if it's invisible or it doesn't match the stereotype of the disability.\n\nAlso I'm shocked at the amount of people who are N T A.  I'm guessing none of you have or know someone with a disability.  It being recognized is honestly a privilege, because most of the time it isn't.  Or there is zero support available in your area.  \n\n\nEdit for spelling", "Yes you are an ahole but also seems unfair that someone who knowingly over eats till he is obese gets privileges. Healthy people who take care of themselves get the short end of the stick. Ie the bad chairs. Your HR office is the true ahole here.", "YTA but I support you.

You're NTA; your company is.", "NTA.\n\nYour company sucks for not giving adequate office chairs. You just used their loophole to get around it.", "NTA. The BMI clause sounds a bit silly, but what's worse is your company not providing every single employee with an ergonomically neutral chair by default.

I did Wolverine's BMI: 53.1", "Yup, my BMI says I am obese. I am slightly overweight, but grew up on a farm and have a good bit of muscle under that plush layer. If I can hit 210, I'm at a very healthy muscle:fat ratio but BMI will still say I am overweight.\n\nIt's a truly awful system with such shitty applications. HR needs to resolve the loophole, such as by looking at joint or muscle issues caused by obesity as opposed to just BMI.

A competent HR would talk with lawyers to draft a policy that doesn't use a glaringly obvious flawed system like BMI, but still benefits disabled workers.

Obesity is not always due to binge eating and stereotypical overeating.", "How about before the metal skeleton?", "Yeah, BMI is kind of a bad indicator of 'healthy' weight.\n\nIt sounds like you and are in similar situations; I didn't grow up on a farm, but I've been doing martial arts for decades, and my PCP says that for me, 210 is a perfectly healthy weight, and the fact that all my blood work, blood pressure, and resting heart rate are fine backs that up, along with a few other tests that I've had done from time to time.  There was one period, some years ago, for non-medical reasons, I decided to lose a bunch of weight, got down to 185, and people who hadn't seen me since before I started on the weight loss but had known me for years thought I was deathly ill (like, dying of cancer), even though that was *still* in the Overweight category for BMI.\n\n\nHeck, if I could get a great new chair just by telling HR that, by their standard, I was unhealthily overweight, I'd to that too!", "I\u2019m a little torn on this.
