Your girlfriend seemingly disregarded it.  Perhaps someone could quibble and say you could use more sensitivity and tact, but the reality is that you're riding out an anaphylactic reaction, so your mood isn't going to be super great.  I know what those feel like (bee stings).\n\nBeyond the immediate issue of whether or nor you're an asshole; I think you need to examine this relationship on a more fundamental level.  You're talking about marrying a person who willfully, and in a very literal sense, put your life in danger over a food product.  Given this dynamic, is she willing to keep a nut-free household when you're married?  Is having children together something you've considered?  A fair bit of research suggests there is a hereditary element to such allergies.  Will she endanger your children in a similar manner?\n\nAfter two years together, I think these are some very legitimate and fundamental questions you need to be asking.", "I'm sorry.

Because that\u2019s what you do when you care about and love people. \n\nThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that she doesn\u2019t give a single fuck about your health\u2026 so therefore she doesn\u2019t care about you.

I've been married 25 years and I am telling you now, having family that are willing to get involved with every argument you have will make your marriage a living nightmare. \nThis does not bode well for your future together.

She should not be eating anything with peanuts/peanut butter on days you plan to go out and if she can\u2019t abstain for a day, that\u2019s a massive red flag.

This is not marriage material!!!", " NTA - I don\u2019t have an allergy but the smell of peanut butter makes me want to vomit and my skin crawl. I have never had any guy I dated or my husband ever question it and happily didn\u2019t partake because they, well, cared about me enough not to gross me out like that. \n\nAn allergy takes this to an entirely different level. I mean, why would she want you to break out in hives over a peanut butter cup? Certainly your health and comfort are worth skipping a spoonful of peanut butter\u2026 or they should be \n\nSounds like it\u2019s time to rethink this relationship \u2014 if she cannot make this one concession I can assure you that it will only be worse if you end up moving in together or get married.", "NTA for not wanting to die bud.

How will this ever work when you live together? \n\nCould it have been someone other than your GF?  Yes, of course it could be.

Or she could have been indignant as she did wash as you asked!\n\nOr, she could have been surprised.  And asked if she also needed to wear different clothes. \n\nInstead she complained that you were policing her food intake and calling her dirty.  That is someone who is unwilling to take your health seriously.  And she will pick her favorite food over your health.", "NTA. If she loves you the way you love her it\u2019s not asking too much of her to not eat peanut butter on date nights. The fact that she had the nerve to be mad about you \u201cpolicing her food intake\u201d while you\u2019re having an allergic reaction because of her is crazy. I would be feeling bad about being the cause if it was a stranger let alone my boyfriend. \n\nAlso WTF does her family have to do with anything!? Idk why she felt the need to get them involved in anything. She seems young and/or immature and not like someone you should even consider marrying if this is the way she acts.", "I love peanut butter too, like just like your girlfriend. If my husband was allergic it would literally be the least I could do to not eat peanut butter the day of a date. Hell, I wouldn\u2019t even keep it in the house if we lived together.
