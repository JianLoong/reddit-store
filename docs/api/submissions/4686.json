Your girlfriend seemingly disregarded it.  Perhaps someone could quibble and say you could use more sensitivity and tact, but the reality is that you're riding out an anaphylactic reaction, so your mood isn't going to be super great.  I know what those feel like (bee stings).\n\nBeyond the immediate issue of whether or nor you're an asshole; I think you need to examine this relationship on a more fundamental level.  You're talking about marrying a person who willfully, and in a very literal sense, put your life in danger over a food product.  Given this dynamic, is she willing to keep a nut-free household when you're married?  Is having children together something you've considered?  A fair bit of research suggests there is a hereditary element to such allergies.  Will she endanger your children in a similar manner?\n\nAfter two years together, I think these are some very legitimate and fundamental questions you need to be asking.", "I'm sorry.

I've been married 25 years and I am telling you now, having family that are willing to get involved with every argument you have will make your marriage a living nightmare. \nThis does not bode well for your future together.

This is not marriage material!!!", " NTA - I don\u2019t have an allergy but the smell of peanut butter makes me want to vomit and my skin crawl. I have never had any guy I dated or my husband ever question it and happily didn\u2019t partake because they, well, cared about me enough not to gross me out like that. \n\nAn allergy takes this to an entirely different level. I mean, why would she want you to break out in hives over a peanut butter cup? Certainly your health and comfort are worth skipping a spoonful of peanut butter\u2026 or they should be \n\nSounds like it\u2019s time to rethink this relationship \u2014 if she cannot make this one concession I can assure you that it will only be worse if you end up moving in together or get married.", "NTA for not wanting to die bud.

How will this ever work when you live together? \n\nCould it have been someone other than your GF?  Yes, of course it could be.

Or she could have been indignant as she did wash as you asked!\n\nOr, she could have been surprised.  And asked if she also needed to wear different clothes. \n\nInstead she complained that you were policing her food intake and calling her dirty.  That is someone who is unwilling to take your health seriously.  And she will pick her favorite food over your health.", "NTA. If she loves you the way you love her it\u2019s not asking too much of her to not eat peanut butter on date nights. The fact that she had the nerve to be mad about you \u201cpolicing her food intake\u201d while you\u2019re having an allergic reaction because of her is crazy. I would be feeling bad about being the cause if it was a stranger let alone my boyfriend. \n\nAlso WTF does her family have to do with anything!? Idk why she felt the need to get them involved in anything. She seems young and/or immature and not like someone you should even consider marrying if this is the way she acts.", "I love peanut butter too, like just like your girlfriend. If my husband was allergic it would literally be the least I could do to not eat peanut butter the day of a date. Hell, I wouldn\u2019t even keep it in the house if we lived together.

She clearly doesn't care about how it affects you", "The fact they are saying it wasn't the gf who caused the reaction but some random stranger he may have happened to be near. Nope definitely not the girl with Reese's wrappers in her car who he kisses...\n\nThey will end up being the death of him one day - literally.", "Washing hands is an insanely low bar \u2026 and \n\n1.  She didn\u2019t wash her hands \n\n2. She LIED to you about washing her hands \n\n3. She didn\u2019t show any remorse after her inaction harmed you \n\n4. Tried to play the victim (accused you of calling her dirty for not washing her hands after she didn\u2019t \u2026wash her hands) \n\n5. Brought her mother and brothers into this (your feelings are not a democracy\u2026 no one but you gets a vote) \n\nPlease stop making excuses for her before she accidentally kills you with her carelessness.  She\u2019s not acting like a caring partner. I\u2019m sorry", "It's such a nothingburger request and really concerning that she would be willing to put you at risk like this. My best friend's husband is West African and he loooooves peanuts in any form. We went to Five Guys once (a burger place where they have free peanuts on the tables) and the man demolished a ridiculous serving. Well... they had a baby who turned out to have a severe peanut allergy. Husband hasn't eaten a peanut or peanut product in 2.5 years, and I don't think he even thinks twice about it now, because he cares for his baby's life.", "OP read the above again. This is what someone who cares about you would sound like.    I think you know who the a h is, and you deserve better.", "Definitely NTA. I have a severe reaction to shellfish. Like, full anaphylaxis. I\u2019m not dating anyone. But my best friend (who I\u2019ve only known for a couple of years) is SO careful with it around me. He *loves* shellfish. Specifically crab. So if he has anything shellfish, he goes out of his way to wash up and make sure he\u2019s clean before coming around me. He\u2019s even showered before coming to see me. Not just wash his hands or something. If this girl cared about you in the slightest, she would be willing to be more careful. She\u2019d follow through with your (simple and not very expectant) requests of washing her hands and brushing her teeth. Honestly, I think it may be worth re-evaluating your relationship with her. Ultimately your decision, but I do think it would be worth it to seriously consider everything.", "I like to read the second part of this comment as \"Charon is rooting for you because he's looking forward to punting your asses down the Styx.\"", "Agree. I read these types of posts and really try to play devils advocate for the person who doesn\u2019t get a chance to offer their side, but in this case I don\u2019t see how there is a legitimate other side. I\u2019m sorry that OP might have to give up someone he cares about but this is so egregious, he really needs to dump her.", "She always promised that she\u2019d \u201cget her fix\u201d outside the house when we married. Tonight casts doubts and that\u2019s another shitty comment I said to her. I\u2019ll edit to reflect that", "Honestly I get the point you\u2019re making. I\u2019m not happy she involved her family but there are extenuating circumstances that make it more understandable that she did so. (Wonky family dynamics)", "She\u2019s later 20s, I\u2019m earlier 20s. It contributes a lot to our conflicts because I tend to take the snappier, or more immediately gratifying, route due to immaturity. \n\nIt is something to consider that her family got involved, but at the same time I accept she has a very close relationship with her family, and always has, which skews that \u201cred flag\u201d more toward orange.", "Honestly that\u2019s a good point. I do know how she reacts when she\u2019s made a genuine mistake and this is just not that. It\u2019s her being on guard. She\u2019s a sweet woman, she\u2019ll try to figure out how she messed up usually and try to help extensively. This is not the behavior I\u2019ve come to expect from her", "I guess I agree. She always said she\u2019d give it up but only in hypotheticals. \u201cIf\u201d we moved in together. \u201cIf\u201d we married. I know how much she adores peanut butter, so that should be a greater factor in my hopes.", "No she knows he says so multiple times", "We had a sort of standing agreement that she\u2019d \u201cget her fix of peanuts\u201d outside of the house when we moved in together. After this the cynical part of me says it was probably more jokes than anything else, but I don\u2019t know quite what to do with the thought that she was planning to move in with the peanut butter not changing at all", "I agree. Also, I can imagine her giving you peanut butter on purpose because for sure you're exaggerating or for another equally dumb reason.", "*You've heard of Momma's boy now get ready for... Momma's girl, an all-new and sometimes even fiercer foe! Now you too can have the unique pleasure of your SO's family getting unnecessarily involved in your drama! Don't worry they're happy to tell you you're wrong despite your terrible peanut allergy, they'll cram Reese's down your throat! She lies, she gaslights and she'll always choose her family over you! What more could you possibly want in a partner!?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry this is ridiculous it's just all I could think about reading this post \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "All of this.", "My partner has many allergies when I consume the food. I brush my teeth use mouthwash wash my hand my face\u2026 even my hair if I have too\u2026 b/c I love my partner and I hate seeing him in pain", "I understand it's for medical reasons, I'm not bashing you at all.... but that's also a shitty way to live, she'd never be able to be comfortable in her own home, if pb is that level of a comfort food for her... so after every shitty day at work she has to hide in the car to down a jar of jiff, rent a motel room to shower and brush her teeth before she comes home?\n\nYes I'm exaggerating a bit to prove a point but... i really don't think you two are compatible long term, like build a life together long term.", "Well obviously you know the situation better than I do, just make sure she's worth dealing with those family dynamics for the rest of your life. And to be clear, the problem isn't that she told her family about it, it's that they felt entitled to harass you to the point where you had to block them. Family dynamics or no, they will have to learn to stay out of your marriage. Good luck to you.", "The blocking is the red flag, not her relationship with them. She\u2019s close with them and you\u2019ve gone NC already and you\u2019re not even engaged. I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t have blocked them, obviously the dismissal of your medical condition is unacceptable, but where do you go from here if her feelings over a slight rebuke are more important than your medical condition?", "OP.... no one, no one, loves peanut butter that much. Also, cardiac issues? \n\nSeriously, I had a bf with a seafood allergy & accidentally kissed him... my reaction was guilt & shame that my lack of diligence caused him discomfort. \n\nYou deserve someone who loves you, cares for your well being, handles conflict privately, and so much more. Good luck OP, I can tell you love her, I hope she pulls her head out of her oily ass.", "I'm sorry but that sounds like she just says it so you would marry her. After marriage she probably will get mad at you if you tell her to keep away from peanut butter for your health with the excuse of \"you married me for me, why do i have to change my habits\". \n\nCould you ask her to do a trial run, like a week of not eating peanut butter for your sake and would learn about food safety around you. That would be the best start to try. Then you could really see if she would change for your relationship.", "I hate to admit you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not fair that something so small that brings her such pleasure might be barred if we progress. Someone else in the post said they worked better as friends despite loving someone and I guess it really does make sense. I adore her and I wish her only the best in life. \n\nIf that means her being with another peanut butter lover or just someone not allergic, so she doesn\u2019t have to treat it like a dirty secret, who am I to stand in the way of her happiness?\n\nI do want to have a solid discussion about it with her of course. I just didn\u2019t know if I was out of line even asking her to hold back. You gave me a good perspective to consider about both our wants and needs", "It's a tough conversation to have but you gotta look at something like this in terms of can you do this for the rest of your lives, there is no temporary compromise available. You'll always be allergic and she'll always love it. \n\nI want to make a pb and jelly/Romeo & Juliet pun but am coming up short.\n\nYou're two nut crossed lovers just sounds dirtier than need be", "Dirtier for sure but I totally just laughed my ass off", "Good! \n\nSincerely, best of luck."]}
