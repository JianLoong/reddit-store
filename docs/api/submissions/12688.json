Mortgage, utilities and grocery. I also do alot of the household work as sometimes she can barely get off the bed. She's been gradually getting better and might be able to go back to education, she's a drop out. \n\nSo recently my girlfriend really adamant on getting a therapy pet. To which I firmly deny her of. So last Friday we had some friends coming in from both sides for her birthday. She casually mentioned it and a few of her friends was pretty upset about it. They called me out and said I was abusive and trying to trap my girlfriend in a depressive cycle. We bickered of course.\n\nAfterwards my friends comforted me but still insinuate that I was an asshole for denying my girlfriend of something that's good for her mental health.\n\n\nEdit: forgot to add this in. My girlfriend is willing to pay for the full amount for the pet but I think there's also paying for it's vet visit. Cleaning it's area and grooming it that's very troublesome.\n\nEdit: we did talk to her therapist about it. The therapist said that I'm expected to be taking care of the pet primary and I'm not ready for that commitment. She is also not approved for an ESA yet. She's been talking to her therapist about it since last December.\n\nEdit: i would like to add that my girlfriend didn't really complain about it. We talk about it a few times and we have left that matter to rest for quite a while. We are going to talk about it after her therapist decides that an ESA is a good move.

They don\u2019t know they\u2019re there for therapeutic purposes\u2014they have their own needs. Someone in a depressive episode _cannot_ provide the level of care required for most animals.\n\nI\u2019d be less concerned about costs and more concerned about day-to-day care. There were times in my 20s, deep in the trauma, when I had pets I absolutely should not have been responsible for. It made my mental state _worse_ because I felt so bad about neglecting their care, but I physically couldn\u2019t get out of bed to change the litter box. \n\nI got through it, and my pets thrived, but it would\u2019ve been irresponsible for me to get a new pet in a state like that. I wish I could go back and temporarily rehome my cats so they didn\u2019t have to live like that. \n\nToo many people look to external motivators to heal them (pets, babies, new relationships) when what they really need is to do the work.

Join her for a therapy session where you can discuss your concerns.\n\nIf she really wants a pet, maybe you can use that as an incentive to motivate her to get her life in order (education, a job, to chip in with household chores, and contribute to living expenses). Set your conditions and tell her that if she does that, the pet idea will be back on the table for discussion.\n\nNTA", "If you are the one who is going to take care of the pet NTA\n\nIf she want a support pet, she is supposed to take care of it too.

I foster for our local shelter, and I check in with every member of our family (including our kids) before I bring in a pet even temporarily because pets can be a huge disruption to a family/couple/household. Even for those who aren't the caregivers. \n\nIf everyone in the household isn't on board with a new pet, then you should not get a pet -- even an ESA. And you don't even need a \"good reason\": \"I don't want a pet\" is a good enough reason. \n\nThere are many other treatment options that could better serve your partner, and I hope she considers them. Best of luck to the both of you!\n\neta: I'd be calling the friends TAs in this scenario, to be clear, not your girlfriend.

None of us knows your situation better than you.", "NTA\n\nWhile I love pets (I have several cats), owning a pet is a **huge lifelong commitment**.  If you're not both 100% willing **and able** to take care of the pet, whatever it is, it would be a disservice to the pet as well as both of you, to adopt one.\n\nIt's not just about the money which your GF has.  It's about the time, attention and ability to care for that pet's needs.  **The most important thing here is how well the therapy pet's needs will be met.  Not your GF's.**\n\nAs of right now, where your GF can barely get out of bed, **DO NOT GET A THERAPY PET**.  You already have a full plate and you'd be adding all of the pet care as well.  That's not good for you, your relationship or the therapy pet.\n\nIf all her AH friends are so insistent she have a therapy pet, why don't they volunteer their time to do most of the care of the therapy pet?  If they won't offer concrete help, every day, they should shut up.", "NTA based on OP's added edits and comments. \n\nI feel like the original post is still missing some crucial information that's been added in comments. \n\nOP is her primary caregiver. She(OP) cooks, cleans, prepares her medication, feeds her, etc. OP attends therapy with her and has even skipped classes to do so. Her own therapist is hesitant about the idea of a therapy animal and has informed OP during these joint sessions that she will be the sole caretaker of the animal as well as continuing to be the primary caregiver to her girlfriend. That's all on top of working and being in school.  \n\nShe is not considering a dog or cat either, she is considering a chicken or duck. Feels like a situation where the novelty will eventually wear off. Especially since she's already changed her mind once from chicken to duck. Those animals are harder to take care of and are primarily outside, so even if OP isn't home all day to help with the emotional aspect of her girlfriend's mental health issues, if she's too depressed to get out of bed how will an animal that's always outside help? \n\nAnimals are not toys and disrupt the entire household. Everyone needs to be on board with the idea of a pet. Since OP will be the one taking care of the animal, and it's not even something sensible like a cat,  she's fully within her right to deny the request. Even if it was a cat OP is still well within her right to refuse an additional full time responsibility. Pets can be an amazing source of emotional support but this just doesn't seem like a situation where the animal's well being can be put first. ESA or not an animal is an animal. They may do things to cause your girlfriend more stress rather than relieve it. It just seems like a massive full time responsibility to be added to a long list of current responsibilities. Her own therapist is uneasy about the idea, that should tell you something.", "NTA. Living with a pet requires both people to be on board and involved. \n\nINFO: you mentioned in comments that your GF often cannot bathe herself.

I also don\u2019t understand what the therapist is going on about - one of the benefits of getting a dog to help with your mental health is taking it out so you\u2019re forced outside, and other assorted care to get you out of bed. \n\nCan you get a cat rather than a dog, and have your gf use the inheritance to get one of those self cleaning litter boxes? Cats are pretty low maintenance.", "NTA A duck isn't a therapy animal.", "NTA\n\n>Edit: we did talk to her therapist about it. The therapist said that I'm expected to be taking care of the pet primary and I'm not ready for that commitment. She is also not approved for an ESA yet. She's been talking to her therapist about it since last December.\n\nYour GF can\u2019t manage to care for a pet on her own, and expects you to care for the animal.  Absolutely not\n\nNext: the GF wants a DUCK?  Good grief NO!  Ducks are NOT pets.  They absolutely do NOT belong inside the house.  They belong out side, in a pond, away from the house, in a flock with other ducks.  They make lousy pets and their waste gets everywhere if they are nearby.   They are nasty.", "Honestly, this woman sounds like too much fucking work. Can\u2019t work, can\u2019t handle a pet. Christ, you\u2019re way more patient than I am.\n\nAre you sure this isn\u2019t just puppy love, since you have known her since a young age?\n\nNTA.", "NTA, the therapy pet is a temporary fix.  It won't be allowed public access so she needs to learn to function without it.", "Moral of the story: OP should have clarified esa pet as in a duck. Now it\u2019s settled bc wtf a duck \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, gf is an asshole for wanting to force a duck to live in a two bedroom apartment. The duck will not like the apartment because ducks don't live in fuckin apartments.", "NTA. Here's a suggestion - if your GFs friends are so adamant that she should have a duck as a therapy animal, they can house and care for it and let GF visit whenever she likes.", "NTA Ducks make a mess, the waggle their tail feathers from side to side vigorously and spray liquid diarrhoea everywhere and anywhere. They are not a suitable support animal. A cat needs minimal care, but is very loving and will purr on your lap and curl up next to you on the bed. But they can be very destructive to furniture. Dogs need exercise and taking out regularly to toilet and puppies will chew up stuff. If you are the primary care taker of that pet then it has to be that you are completely on board with it. Pets can live a long long time and be expensive. My cat is 19 and costs an absolute fortune in medication.", "NTA since the responsibility for caring for the animal would fall on you. \n\nAlso a duck would basically mean that even when she's doing better someday she shouldn't get a job unless it's work from home. Ducks are social animals and can't just be left home alone for hours like that, it would be very stressful and cruel to the duck. If she does eventually get an ESA she should choose something that will be ok to be alone when necessary when she gets to a state of healing that allows her to live more of her life outside the house. \n\nBtw I speak as someone who had a duck who was kind of like an ESA during a period of depression. She loved coming in the house and she'd watch movies with me and was very affectionate. But whenever she wasn't with me she had a flock to go back to outside so she was never alone.", "NAH, \n\nI don\u2019t know the whole story but if severe depression is part of what you\u2019re treating, a duck in an apartment is probably not the best answer. \n\nMy therapist and doctor only agreed to an ESA for me because my stress and anxiety didn\u2019t inhibit my activity. It actually ramped me up. I\u2019d get home from work or from the hospital and just pace for hours. Getting an ESA allowed me to expend all of that nervous energy and redirect  it in a healthy way for myself and the animal. \n\nIf I start pacing or crying, Spots will follow me throughout the apartment, meowing, until I sit down and pet him. This isn\u2019t a behavior I trained into him but I do reinforce that behavior with rewards and walks.\n\nIf your girlfriends behavior includes periods of neglect for herself and/or others (not cleaning, showering, eating/cooking) then an esa really isn\u2019t something I think any therapist would or should recommend. That\u2019s really entering actual service animal territory. Which are mostly dogs. \n\nBut if she\u2019s truly passionate about a pet and the esa is just a means to an end, I\u2019d recommend getting a pet that fits into your current life style.\n\nA duck doesn\u2019t fit into an apartment and has basic needs that you really can\u2019t supply in that environment. It\u2019s cruel to the duck \ud83e\udd86.", "Dude bounce, you have life ahead of you and she is a drag.", "The reality is that the pet MIGHT help her be more functional, but it also may not be.  Ugh, I'm really torn between no asshole here (I understand her desires and your concerns) and everyone sucks (she doesn't seem to respect your concerns, and you are not respecting the help that an emotional support pet can provide)..\n\nI guess I'm landing on no asshole here- but that you could be making things worse by making this decision, and I hope you will reconsider it.\n\nEDITED AFTER FURTHER COMMENTS FROM OP:  NTA - A DUCK?  And her therapist isn't behind this for her?  NTA", "A pet can be extremely healing and therapeutic but they\u2019re also very expensive. I understand your hesitancy but I do think you need a further discussion, if you\u2019re open to it. Is your gf currently seeing a counselor or therapist to work through her trauma? \n\nMaybe before you guys adopt, could your girlfriend volunteer at a local animal shelter or try fostering for a bit before committing to a pet?", "NTA- though the pet may be motivating, it is also a huge commitment. I look at it similarly to people who get an active dog as motivation to exercise. I\u2019m sure there are some that do, but there are also many people who do not, and it is the animal who suffers. I think some people may have not thought about what happens to the pet if she is unable to care for it, or if maybe your relationship does not last. Dogs and cats can be a 15 year commitment, and both members of a couple should be ready for that commitment, no matter their mental state. The fact that the therapist doesn\u2019t think she is ready is also a detail not to be overlooked.", "Huge NTA. You sound like a very understanding and fantastic partner.

You sound really controlling.", "NTA but I think you should give her some reasons. \n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that a pet will be good for her mental health. She might find a new purpose in life and gets out of bed to take care of it or dump most of all the responsibilities on you.

So i guess info needed.", "I mean I guess it\u2019s your place so you can enforce your own rules but just saying no without considering it is an AH move especially if she is really struggling. She lost her parents\u2026maybe actually think it through at least\u2026yikes.", "First why does finances have anything to do with it?  Second you \"denied her\"... a partnership is a partnership meaning you talk about it- come to a conclusion- you don't dictate. \nLastly- as you stated she had a very traumatic event and lost her parents. Please put yourself in her shoes. Therapy pets have proven to help alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. If you love her the way you say you do, would you not agree to help her in any manner you could? She said she would take care of it and pay for everything- so what harm does it do to you? Specially if it brings her some relief?\n\nJust a side note- I suffer from PTSD and severe panic attacks. I wanted a dog. My husband understood why I wanted one and we went and got one. My dog has been life changing for me. She helps when I have panic attacks, calms me when I'm upset and helps get me out of the house.

Because I hate people like that. If you\u2019re too anxious/depressed/whatever to be without your pet, you need therapy and to use the delivery option for shopping.

Would she be willing to go for something else instead?", "Okay, I'm going to comment again... based on your edits and comments, I'm not only going to say NTA, but I'm also going to say that you would be TA if you agree.  It sounds like your GF needs intense, inpatient therapy.  This is well above just the desire to get a DUCK as a therapy animal (which is completely inappropriate due to its needs).  Have you discussed with her therapist the idea of her getting more serious medical treatment?", "NTA -  As someone who has an ESA, he's been a massive help for me, but he's for my anxiety and PTSD, not depression.  If I were depressed, I know I wouldn't be able to care for him in the way he needs to be cared for.  \n\nThey require care and they aren't exactly cheap.  I can't just 'I can't get out of bed today, sorry Felix.'  He needs his litter cleaned, his food, his playtime, his treats, vet visits, grooming, claws clipped, etc.  \n\nI understand that she wants one, but if she struggles to care for herself, it shouldn't fall to you to take care of the animal.

Anything less than a large water trough on a piece of land is neglectful to their needs. Ducks aren't easy like cats. Molting is also a major pain in the ass, it happens every season, and I couldn't imagine it in a city scape. Plus, they can't be potty trained. Expect duck feces to be literally everywhere. \n\nIf she truly wants an ESA, look at a cat first. I have 3 and they are the easiest pets I've ever had, but your girlfriend does need to learn how to be responsible for ANY pet she will have. \n\nOP, get her a stuffed animal duck if she wants one so bad. \n\nDucks are a pain if you don't live on an actual farm. \n\nNTA.   \n\n\nSource - Have ducks on our farm.", "I think that this is above Reddit's pay grade.\nThe best thing to do, in my unprofessional opinion, is have a calm discussion. \n\nWould you be willing to live with an ESA of any kind in the future?

A duck? I love animals and I love ducks but I love ducks outside where they can't crap on my floors. Good Lord!", "NTA. First of all, the therapist putting the primary animal care on you is not okay. They can\u2019t expect you to do that. Frankly I don\u2019t trust a therapist that would put that kind of expectation on someone like that. What would they do if you weren\u2019t around?? She can hire a carer if it\u2019s that important. \n\nSecondly, as for her wanting a duck\u2014this is just a bad idea, especially if she\u2019s intending to keep it as a house pet. I\u2019m gonna talk about it assuming that a housepet is the idea. Farm birds like ducks are fuckin gross. Speaking from experience here. They poop everywhere, it still smells bad even if you get them diapers, and if diapered them you would have to clean the diapers and duck\u2019s butt constantly so they don\u2019t get what\u2019s known as \u201cpasty butt\u201d (where their vent is basically glued shut by poop, deadly if unaddressed). They need to be able to swim in water daily and are very messy eaters and swimmers. They are also social animals who need a flock, it\u2019s uncommon for them to be happy alone. Birds can also get sick pretty easily, and prey birds like ducks try not to show it until sometimes it\u2019s too late to help them; it\u2019s instinct not to show weakness. Vet care is expensive because many vets don\u2019t even work on ducks or chickens because of how hard they are to diagnose and get care for in time. They don\u2019t make great housepets and are simply suited best for an outdoor life. Your girlfriend, when it is feasible, should look into alternatives that are better suited for her lifestyle.\n\nETA: almost all the same care stuff goes for chickens as well, except they need a dust bath area instead of water to swim in.", "NTA.\n\n\nBut you don't have a gf, you have a dependant.", "NTA. She can't care for an animal and your plate is full supporting her and being her full-time carer. Bringing any animal (but especially a highly social bird who CAN'T be housetrained - they don't have a sphincter they can control the way we do) into that situation is desperately unfair to the animal and to you. Even if you had superhuman reserves of time, energy, and resources, animals bond with their caregivers, not with the people who fuss over them for a few minutes and go back to bed. It would act like YOUR pet, and she'd resent that.\n\nI'd suggest contacting 4H or a therapy animal program and see if anyone with a friendly, diaper-acclimated duck is willing to do outreach visits. Your GF might be able to visit with a duck at home a few times and hear about how complex their care needs are as sort of a compromise. But really, her focus needs to be on either getting better or accepting that she needs full-time care and *hiring a professional carer* so you can be her partner and not just her life support. Once that's sorted you guys can revisit the pet discussion.", "NTA", "Why would the therapist say that?

Having a non traditional pet even as an ESA could just give them encouragement to find reasons to not renew your lease.... It sucks but that's the way it goes sometimes. \n\nHave you asked her to consider a more traditional small pet?

It\u2019s more like taking an over the counter painkiller when you have a broken leg, AND a cast.  The cast is the treatment part, the pain killer is just a small part, to make it easier.
