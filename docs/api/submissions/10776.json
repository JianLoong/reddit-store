I'm not a meddling MIL, she had a rough upbringing from her mother's addiction and abandonment the first 15 years of her life and has trust/control issues (She couldn't control much as a kid and wants to control everything now). \n\nLet me also say that her mother has done amazing things with her life since getting sober and I give her full credit for this. \n\nHer mother has lived with them since they moved in together over 10 years ago. Both of them are judgmental and at times and don't seem to care for me very much. \n\nMy DIL is currently cooking their 3rd child which will also be their 3rd girl. Do I want a grandson? Of course. It would be fun to have another little boy just like my amazing son (31). \n\nI have had and still have my share of faults, however, both of my kids will tell you I was good mother and my daughter will tell you I'm a fantastic Nonie (I have the oldest 8 year old girl half time and we co-parent). My son knows in his heart I'm a great GM but you really can't tell since my DIL has never let me be alone with them except upstairs in their playroom. To be fair, she has never left them with anyone except her mother. \n\nMy DIL's younger brother just had a baby boy. I did the usual congratulations on Facebook. I ended the post with a joke saying \"This may be the only 'grandson' I get\". \"Good thing (Son) and (Daughter) have male animals. LOL\". It was totally a joke. I didn't mean to hurt feelings or cause my DIL stress. \n\nMy DIL texted me that my post to her brother was rude and out of line and I \"better delete it. Unbelievable\". This is not the first time she's told me in text how \"Unbelievable\" I am. I immediately took down the comment and texted her that I was sorry. It was meant to be a joke and that I understand pregnancy can be hard, but that I thought her wording and demand to me was 'rude and out of line'. Her response? \"There is so much more I could say\". So I told her to grow up and say it. That maybe we should stop pretending that everything is ok. I may or may not have said something to the effect of \"maybe your mom wants to chime in (as she has done on many occasions that do not involve her)\" but I can neither confirm nor deny that I made that comment. LOL \n\nSo. AITA asshole for wanting my DIL to just tell me how she feels and what she has to say so we can or cannot move past it for the sake of my son and grand girls. \n\nI have been asking my son for two years to sit down with me (maybe an hour tops) so he and I an discuss some stuff because I haven't told him all the times his wife or MIL have said inappropriate things to myself or my husband. I would never want to put him in a position where he thinks he has to choose (and I would NEVER ask him to that. He's just very sensitive and doesn't care much for confrontation). Every time we make a plan, DIL finds a way to sabotage it. And please, no comments on how my son needs to grow a pair. I know this and telling me won't change him.", "created_utc": 1677176605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a4qui/aita_for_telling_my_daughterinlaw_to_grow_up_and/", "score": 280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your low key shaming your DIL for not having any sons on social media. DIL can\u2019t control the gender of the child she is carrying. And I bet she is fully aware that her husband may have wanted a boy. \n\nYou say that your Facebook comment was a joke, but it wasn\u2019t. You meant every word you said. Even in the post, you say \u201c my DIL is currently cooking their \u20263rd girl. Do I want grandson? Of course\u201d. \n\nJust because you were a \u201cgreat\u201d mom to your immediate kids doesn\u2019t mean you are a good grandmother or mother in law. This is a great example. Would you have made that same Facebook comment if it was your daughter? No, because you care about your daughter, but apparently not so much your DIL. I get the DIL\u2019s hesitancy to leave you alone with the granddaughters. \n\nIn reality, you shouldn\u2019t be commenting on the DIL and her sons relationship in general. At the end of the day, the DIL can\u2019t truly be upfront with you because you are her husbands/your sons mom.  Any issues is a discussion for your son  and you to work out. He should have confronted you for disrespecting DIL/ his kids, and set future boundaries with you", "YTA. The way you've described your actions paints a very toxic picture. I understand why you're kept at arms length by your son and DIL. Frankly, I think they're wise to do so.", "YTA.\n\nThe reason I prevented my mother from spending unsupervised time with my kids (before I went NC altogether) is because I did not trust what she would say around my children, and I knew from experience how much that could poison family relationships. \n\nI know it might seem like your DIL is being very arbitrary about the lines she's setting, or that she's favoring her mother over you. I promise you, it's at least in part because you don't consider the impact of what you say. You say you aren't intending to be hurtful, and I agree you probably aren't -- but intent does not equal impact, and you have almost certainly left a negative impact on your son and DIL, as well as DIL's family.\n\nI'm about a decade older than your son. I finally went NC with my mother because she could not respect my boundaries and did not see my needs as being as important as hers. I did not make that decision lightly -- in fact, it took me years. I don't regret it at all and it is better for my children not to have her in my life.\n\nIf you don't want your son to be posting on Reddit in a decade's time, telling a stranger that life is better without his mother in it -- if that matters to you at all, for the love of God, apologize and listen to your son and DIL. Don't fight. Listen. See them as equals. Take your drama to a therapist. Realize the negative impact you're having and stop creating it. Thid is your warning from the ghost of Christmas Future.", "YTA just based on several points of your post:\n\n1) Your \"joke\" was out of line. It seems that DIL is very aware that you want a grandson and I would assume that you have either made similar jokes or made mentions of this in the past. I am sure that this is something that really bothers DIL but she doesn't want to cause trouble. \n\n2) The \"joke\" was on Facebook which is a *public platform.* Think about it this way, if this was a topic YOU were sensitive about and then someone in your family made a public \"joke\", I am sure you would not take it lightly. It's incredibly thoughtless and rude.\n\n3) You want to sit your son down and list off every offense from his wife and MIL? Why would you want to go out of your way to put MORE strain on not only your DIL and your relationship, but also your son and wife's marriage? I don't know what positive effect you think this will have, but if it did happen, your son better had stand up for his wife and daughters!! \n\nWhat you NEED to do is either sit down with them and have a discussion where you listen and everything gets hashed out and/or go to therapy. \n\nIt also sounds like you wanted to be surrogate mother to DIL but since you don't get that attention/respect that you are craving, you see others as \"judgmental\" and \"controlling\".", "I can't exactly put my finger on why so I'll reserve putting in a formal jugement but the general taste in my mouth after reading this is that there are tons of missing reasons here and even though I can't quite identify why you give me major ick and like spending time with you would be a major chore. \n\nIt's bothering me that I can't even identify exactly what is triggering me so to speak", "YTA\n\nYour general disposition is just insufferable. You have a snide comment for everything. You blame everyone else and judge constantly. You really believe yourself to be a victim. Your DIL took the words right out of most sane people's mouths: unbelievable.\n\nI'm sorry that you struggle this much with your interpersonal relationships in your family. It would be great if you could all sit down and come to a resolution like you wanted. But notice that the common denominator is you.", "YTA\n\nNot knowing you, this comment about not having a grandson does feel somewhat passive aggressive. I'm sorry you're disappointed this new kid is a girl, but many people are okay with female children and aren't comfortable with wishing they were boys.", "As soon as you said \"my amazing son\" I knew you were the problem.  YTA", "Wait, you have custody of the oldest part time?  Why?", "What's the point of asking if you're not actually interested in listening to your answers. We're neutral, you're giving us only your side of the story, and we're *still* all voting YTA. \n\nYou sound pretty narcissistic. Like, it's everyone else's problem that they don't like the way you act? If you can muster the empathy, try to put yourself in your DIL's position. \n\nMoreover, phrases such as \"methinks the lady doth protest too much\" are such a blatant dismissal of someone's feelings. You don't get to decide if someone else is hurt by stuff you do/say.", "YTA. She is not \u2018controlling\u2019, she is in control and it bothers you. And you would never put your son in the position to choose because you know every man chooses their wife over their mother, as it should be. Start kissing ass big time.", "YTA.  You're a bloody caricature of an interfering, obnoxious, hateful mother in law.    You sound like Marie on Everybody Loves Raymond except that Marie actually did have a few decent qualities.  not a ton, but some.       \n\n\nYou need to do some serious introspection.       \n\n\nYour 'wonderful' son is a grown man and father and he is picking his family over you, which means he does in fact, 'have a pair', because he's not letting you try to control him.", "Oof. YTA.\n\n>My DIL is currently cooking their 3rd child which will also be their 3rd girl.\n\nSo, how long have you viewed your DIL as nothing more than an incubator? \n\n>My DIL's younger brother just had a baby boy. I did the usual congratulations on Facebook. I ended the post with a joke saying \"This may be the only 'grandson' I get\". \n\nUm, hate to tell you this, that child is nothing to you. The child is not your grandson and you are not his grandma. \n\n>\"Good thing (Son) and (Daughter) have male animals. LOL\". It was totally a joke. I didn't mean to hurt feelings or cause my DIL stress.\n\nThe only thing that's a joke here is you. Way to totally disparage your granddaughters. \n\n>Every time we make a plan, DIL finds a way to sabotage it.\n\nReally? Every time? Maybe he's just as fed up with his own mother as his wife is.", "So first - your DIL's younger brother...now I don't have living grandparents anymore but I'm 99% sure my cousins on my mom's side did not call my grandma on my dad's side their grandparent...so little confused about how your DIL's younger brothers child, would in turn be your grandchild...\n\nSecond point, you say specifically your DIL prevents you from spending time alone with your grandkids, and you've never brought this up to your son? So realistically, your son could have been part of the one to make this decision? \n\nNow I just want the tea - what else has she said?!?", "Yta 'my dil, who I constantly belittle in the form of jokes and psychoanalysis, doesn't let me impose my parenting style on her kids.  Why????'\n\nThey are not your kids. You are not their parent.  She sounds like she knows you are over bearing and like stirring up shit and she just won't take it.\n\nIt also sounds like she *has* told you many, many times when your behavior is not acceptable.  You just don't want to hear it.", "Yta 'my dil, who I constantly belittle in the form of jokes and psychoanalysis, doesn't let me impose my parenting style on her kids.

The open shaming of her for having another daughter is bad enough. Couple that with here in the comments you say your family is pretty toxic. Which means you have likely made what to you were just off hand comments or \"teasing\" that to them were open hostility, so they returned that energy. You may have been raised that this was \"thinking out loud\" or \"playful banter\" but to someone who survived abuse, every word matters and they are taken very seriously. As someone who's done trauma therapy, we are taught to watch for early precursors to abuse. Like passive aggressive comments, people constantly being negative even if they do try to play it off as a joke, or people demanding we sacrifice our boundaries. And this \"say what you need to say\" push, may be what tips her to begging your son to go no contact.", "YTA\n\n>My DIL is currently cooking their 3rd child which will also be their 3rd girl. Do I want a grandson? Of course.\n\nThe fact that you consider pregnancy \"cooking\" is disgusting and then it only gets worse from here. Your DIL's brother is not related to you and yet you go into his comments and make a comment that you think is a joke. \n\n>I did the usual congratulations on Facebook. I ended the post with a joke saying \"This may be the only 'grandson' I get\". \"Good thing (Son) and (Daughter) have male animals\n\nPlease tell me what is funny in what you wrote.", "YTA. Whether you realise it or not, you're a JNMIL. You seem very rude and tbh, she's right for calling you out.", "YTA, Why does it seem like every grandmother is incapable of not posting obnoxious shit on Facebook and pretending like it's all just some big \"LOL\" and \"my daughter in law is making a huge deal out of nothing\" the moment it pisses off the actual parents who are in the crosshairs?", "what would be the point in \u201c telling \u201c your son hurtful thing his MIL and wife say. What purpose would that serve what do you want him to do with the information. Trust me your Son knows you, his Wife, and his MIL he\u2019s lived with all of you at certain points,  he\u2018s not sitting down with you because he doesn\u2019t want to hear it,  yet you blame his wife for that too.", "YTA. Big time. And your victim mentality is astounding! Over & over you repeat how you want to tell your son all the things your DIL & her mother have said to you that you've found offensive. You want to have a private conversation with him where you plan on complaining all about his wife, whom he has chosen for life and has children with.. WHILE she's pregnant.. He's clearly still very much connected to her and actively choosing her every day. This is ridiculous, grow up.\n\n\nI hope if you can't see your failures as a parent grandparent and mother in law here that you actually follow through. They will go no contact so quick it will make your head spin.. it's so toxic and disgusting that you're convinced you're the victim. It's incredulous.\n\n\nYour own post paints you as the controlling, doting mother who hasn't given up the fantasy of having her little boy still attached at the hip. You wouldn't be happy with anyone he married and convince yourself it's all her. She's the controlling one, she's the mean one, meanwhile you post horrible things like that under the guise of a joke... she's all the things you wanted to be for him now and you hate her for it. Let's acknowledge real quick that it's the men who determine the gender, not the woman. DUH. Be mad at your \"perfect\" son. Every egg has an X sex chromosome; a sperm can have either an X or a Y sex chromosome... DIL has NO fault in your son producing girls. The Y chromosomes he carried were just stronger.\n\n\nI can't imagine the years of verbal abuse, passive aggressive acts and self centered loathsome things you put her through to the point that your perfect nonconfrontational son has chosen to keep you away to keep the peace. They constantly fight because of you and how you treat her with such disregard & disrespect. You've made his life so much harder because you refuse to accept his wife and treat her as an equal. You will definitely lose them all. Stop borrowing money from them and start apologizing earnestly for not including her into your family. Stop treating her like a second rate citizen because of your own jealousy. \n\n\nYou're the definition of a JNMIL. It's so cringy.", "YTA\n\nBy your own account of things you sound toxic AF", "YTA. First, your DIL\u2019 s brother\u2019s child is NOT your grandkid. Ew. Way to overstep. Your comment on the post WAS unbelievable. Jokes are supposed to be funny and this was not funny. It\u2019s you that should \u201cjust grow up and say it\u201d. You\u2019re upset that your DIL is having a girl and you\u2019re poorly disguising it as a joke. You escalated things between you two.

What\u2019s the purpose of sitting down and having a meeting if not to make your son choose?  Maybe not directly, but you do want him to be on your side.\n\nYour post was out of line and you embarrassed yourself!  Guaranteed that everyone who saw that laughed\u2026at YOU for being such an AH mil!", "Yta. The misogyny is coming from inside the house. You couldn't make it any more clear that you are disappointed at only having granddaughters and no grandson. I highly doubt her control issues are the only reason that you aren't allowed to be alone with your grandkids. I'm definitely on DIL's side.", "YTA. WTH is it with a grandson? It\u2019s not the 19th century & the male heir inherits everything. You should be happy the kids are happy & healthy & shut the hell up about the sex of the kid.", "OP is the most passive-aggressive faux-innocent person I\u2019ve ever seen in this sub. YTA and I truly hope a rage-bait troll.", "Years ago I knew a woman who had 3 daughters with her husband, when they told his mother they were pregnant with their 4th daughter, her mother inlaw looked at her, then turned to her son and said, I bet you're regretting marrying her, you deserve a son. Suffice it to say future communication between the woman I knew and her MIL pretty much ceased from that day. Of course YTA, some \"jokes\" just aren't funny, they're cruel and unnecessary", "YTA- as a DIL who has two boys and is currently pregnant (don\u2019t know gender yet) I can\u2019t tell you how hurtful it is to not only have every single person say \u201cbetter be a girl!\u201d But have a MIL say things like this, too. I would actually love another boy, my boys are so sweet and kind. I would also love a girl! But in no way should I feel guilty because my MIl or ANYONE won\u2019t be happy with a boy outcome.  Why don\u2019t you have some more babies and stop when you have a girl.", "YTA You sound a lot like my MIL that my husband and I have been no contact with for years.", "YTA.  It wasn't a joke, it was cruel.  Not only to your son and DIL, but more importantly to your three granddaughters who now know that they are not and will never be as important to you as a grandson.  Good job, Grammie.  (At least now you'll understand why if in the future they don't want to have anything to do with you.)\n\nIt's not \"judgmental\" to call a person out on cruel and unacceptable behavior.  Most people don't care much for others who say and do mean things.  You really don't want your DIL to \"grow up and say what she needs to say\"--you want her to shut up, agree with you, and eat the shit you serve her and her mother just like your son does.   We know this because you complain when she ACTUALLY DOES speak up.", "YTA. You upset your DIL, yet somehow feel like you need an apology from her for her response to *your* passive aggressive comment. Then the whole \u201cmay or may not\u201d bs comment about her mother was completely uncalled for, yet you seem to have found it hilarious. These words can hurt, and they already have. You not finding them hurtful or you saying it\u2019s a joke, doesn\u2019t change that it offended someone. Someone you know you already have a rough relationship with.\n\nThis entire post has been about you and how much you love your son, not one instance of taking  DILs feelings into account. Hell, you even managed to talk good about her mother who mistreated her for half of her life before DIL. She\u2019s not just a person your son\u2019s with, she\u2019s a person with her own history, feelings, and actions. And also the mother of your grandchildren. To think so lowly of her to not even consider her feelings is what\u2019s the issue here. It\u2019s probably why she doesn\u2019t trust you much around the kids, and I can damn near guarantee that\u2019s why she hasn\u2019t told you how she feels about/around you. \n\nI don\u2019t say that to shame you but to say you\u2019re being a hurtful person and don\u2019t realize it\u2014and now\u2019s the time to realize. Telling your DIL to grow up and talk to you is missing the reason *why* she feels she can\u2019t, and using a taunting approach like that is not helping.

I am sure they aren't blameless but I am also sure that you aren't either and their story is very different.  Don't sit down with your son.  Sit down with son and DIL, tell them you want the relationship to be better, and then LISTEN.  And own things that you've done that have been hurtful, even if they weren't intentional.  I'm in touch with my mom, despite a rough childhood, because she managed to do this.  We're not in touch with husband's mom because she would never own any of the awful crap she did.

There are a bunch of books on it - go get one and actually read it.\n\nI think we know why DIL wants nothing to do with you, and won't let you be alone with their child(ren).   You've already impacted your son with your toxicity, so she doesn't want her children to be harmed either.  That's what good mothers do - protect their children from adults (you) who only have their own interests in mind, and always want to make sure that they aren't perceived as the problem to the rest of the world instead of owning their terrible behaviour.  \n\nIt's almost comical to read your post - it's so similar to so many posts on here from narcissistic, toxic parents and how they can't understand why people/their families are refusing to engage or are pushing back on their behaviour.  I think it's time for some reflection on your part, as you have a lot of work to do to show them that you can treat them all with respect and operate within their boundaries.

People are calling out some valid things here, but they\u2019re being incredibly harsh while they do it and I really don\u2019t think all of them are right. Another commenter described some as abusive, and tbh I agree. It\u2019s clear from your responses that you\u2019re struggling to shift your perspective and are having trouble letting go of your narrative, but that you\u2019re TRYING to understand. And you love your family and want things to be better. These are good qualities! You need someone who can help you tease this out so you can get a balanced perspective for what\u2019s happening with your family. We don\u2019t know you, we don\u2019t know DIL, we don\u2019t know the context for these interactions, and we don\u2019t know 100% why everything has gone south. You need to get a more neutral party involved who you can talk to and help you figure it out.\n\nI would send a heartfelt apology to DIL for the comment, then back off. I wouldn\u2019t try to have the sit-down with them now because I think you need to get your head sorted before you do so. Send the apology, find a therapist, and start trying to figure out what has happened FIRST. I think a large part of you feels silenced and invalidated, and that\u2019s why you want to talk about the things DIL and MIL have said that you feel were wrong. Your feelings are definitely valid, and I think you need to get them out! But I don\u2019t think you can get them out to your son and DIL right now, if ever. I don\u2019t think either of them are in a place where they want to hear it. I also think you need to sort through those feelings first and figure out which of them are justified (meaning you need to bring them up), and which are not. The non-justified ones are still okay to feel, it just means you manage those feelings on your own instead of bringing them to other people. Right now everyone is basically telling you that NOTHING you feel is justified, which a) I don\u2019t think we know for sure, and b) are you just supposed to take that at face value? And immediately change, and be able to start communicating healthily? I always need to understand why I\u2019m wrong to really be able to fix it. I don\u2019t think people here are helping you understand. So, again, time for a therapist.\n\nFor others who disagree with this perspective here, I get it! I\u2019ve read y\u2019all\u2019s comments, the narcissist vibes pinged you and you sniffed out those missing reasons. Okay. But for some reason I can\u2019t get on board\u2026the comments I\u2019ve read from OP contain a lot of pain and grief, and I\u2019m genuinely having difficulty reading them and seeing all the anger spewing right back. It was too painful to even get through them all, so hopefully I didn\u2019t miss one where she said she murdered a puppy or something. It seems to me she\u2019s gotten a sufficiently harsh dose of reality at this point, and we probably don\u2019t need to keep smacking her in the face with it. So yeah\u2026I know my opinions not the popular one, and if you disagree I def understand. But I won\u2019t be getting in a debate about it, as I will certainly be logging off Reddit shortly to pour myself a stiff drink instead.\n\nOP, I hope you find some clarity here and can start working your way towards peace with yourself and with your family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not a meddling MIL, she had a rough upbringing from her mother's addiction and abandonment the first 15 years of her life and has trust/control issues (She couldn't control much as a kid and wants to control everything now). Let me also say that her mother has done amazing things with her life since getting sober and I give her full credit for this. Her mother has lived with them since they moved in together over 10 years ago. Both of them are judgmental and at times and don't seem to care for me very much. My DIL is currently cooking their 3rd child which will also be their 3rd girl. Do I want a grandson? Of course. It would be fun to have another little boy just like my amazing son (31). I have had and still have my share of faults, however, both of my kids will tell you I was good mother and my daughter will tell you I'm a fantastic Nonie (I have the oldest 8 year old girl half time and we co-parent). My son knows in his heart I'm a great GM but you really can't tell since my DIL has never let me be alone with them except upstairs in their playroom. To be fair, she has never left them with anyone except her mother. My DIL's younger brother just had a baby boy. I did the usual congratulations on Facebook. I ended the post with a joke saying \"This may be the only 'grandson' I get\". \"Good thing (Son) and (Daughter) have male animals. LOL\". It was totally a joke. I didn't mean to hurt feelings or cause my DIL stress. My DIL texted me that my post to her brother was rude and out of line and I \"better delete it. Unbelievable\". This is not the first time she's told me in text how \"Unbelievable\" I am. I immediately took down the comment and texted her that I was sorry. It was meant to be a joke and that I understand pregnancy can be hard, but that I thought her wording and demand to me was 'rude and out of line'. Her response? \"There is so much more I could say\". So I told her to grow up and say it. That maybe we should stop pretending that everything is ok. I may or may not have said something to the effect of \"maybe your mom wants to chime in (as she has done on many occasions that do not involve her)\" but I can neither confirm nor deny that I made that comment. LOL So. AITA asshole for wanting my DIL to just tell me how she feels and what she has to say so we can or cannot move past it for the sake of my son and grand girls. I have been asking my son for two years to sit down with me (maybe an hour tops) so he and I an discuss some stuff because I haven't told him all the times his wife or MIL have said inappropriate things to myself or my husband. I would never want to put him in a position where he thinks he has to choose (and I would NEVER ask him to that. He's just very sensitive and doesn't care much for confrontation). Every time we make a plan, DIL finds a way to sabotage it. And please, no comments on how my son needs to grow a pair. I know this and telling me won't change him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But I would really dig deep for a real true apology with details and meaning and no expectations from her", "YTA\n\nApologizing and then telling her that she is rude and out of line in the same breath is not an apology.  \n\nYour DIL may be a TA for all the other interactions but you are asking about you.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA. Even if it was supposed to be a joke, it comes across like you're disappointed in your granddaughters.", "YTA", "You all seem pretty unbearable but it also sounds like there are details you aren't including here. \n\nFWIW, I knew my ex's mother was bad, but I had no idea how bad until things came to a head. My mom also thought she was protecting me and my relationship by not telling me about the cruel things this woman had said/done. The thing is, I would never welcome that person into my family knowingly, so my mom wasn't protecting me, she was preventing me from making an educated decision about my future. If my sister hadn't revealed what was going on, I would be typing this as an unhappily married, likely soon-to-be divorced man. \n\nTell your son what is going on.", "YTA, I'm pregnant with what will likely be my last baby. My partner told me he didn't want anymore no matter what this baby turned out to be. We already have a son, I wanted a girl of course to have one of each, but I also want another boy. I had to grieve either way the it went that this would be my last, and I knew if it was a boy that I would forever feel the longing for a daughter and If it was a girl that I would go without a son I always pictured myself having. It turns out I hit the jackpot as many people have said to me (which shows how real gender disappointment can be) and found out I'm having a little girl. \n\nSo imagine your daughter in law who has gone through two pregnancies which are not always easy and likely knows this will be her last finds out she is having another girl. She's trying to feel good about it, trying to grieve that she won't have a little boy and feeling incredibly guilty about it and here comes good ole MIL posting a \"joke\" about how her brother's baby is going to have to take the place of the baby boy she won't have. And when she tries to be the bigger person by not escalating the conversation, MIL pushes her even more. \n\nAgain YTA", "You're not the asshole for telling your DIL to be open about her feelings.

I have a great relationship with my MIL but a public joke such as yours would have damaged us. I am not saying beyond repair, but the damage would be real.\n\nStill I think you are approaching the situation wrong by trying to force a confrontation. Both with your son and DIL. When people \"not care much for confrontation\", confronting them usually do not work the way you think it will. For some people, confrontations leads to clearing the air and moving past the issue. For others, confronting leads only to breaking. It may very well be that if you force the DIL to speak her true mind, she will, and then she will never want to see you again.\n\nFor some people, apologizing and never mention the thing again is what lets them move on. Pretend all is well, go through the motions of normality, and eventually the emotions will calm and the normalitet will become real. \n\nYTA for the joke. Now try to mend it in a way the other person can handle.", "YTA. You remind me exactly of my ex\u2019s mom who I only tolerated for the sake of keeping the peace and his benefit, but stayed as minimal contact with her as possible because she was overbearing and rude.

Too bad they can\u2019t choose which one it is and also, this weird obsession whether it\u2019s a boy or girl is archaic and misogynistic. I would absolutely take offense to a comment like that because it sounds like you are disappointed and making it known publicly or criticizing your own son and DIL\n\nThen you out of nowhere bring up her mom when she expressed that she\u2019s upset, which had nothing to do with the discussion.

My son has loaned us a bit here and there as has my daughter when she is able and we have always paid it back in full, when we said we would. \n\nLike many older people we are living on two fixed incomes and inflation that's going up faster than our COLAs.

She responded she was still in treatment so no settlement talks yet. ANd then in front of my husband, she stage whispered to her nephew \"Why, you aren't getting any\".\n\nAgain, let me be clear. We have borrowed and re-payed loans from my son (the most was $200 at one time and we've only asked twice) but, just the fact that she would say this knowing my husband (who, as you can imagine, at 65 years old is a proud man) could hear her was over the top. \n\nNot to mention that, in my opinion, she shouldn't have even known we borrowed money from my son and his wife. Obviously, if DIL wants to tell her mother that's her prerogative but I just think it shouldn't have happened the way it did.  \n\n\nAnother time, I had to go to physical therapy 3 times a week for 6 weeks to prepare for a multi-level spinal fusion surgery. \n\nWe only had one car at the time and my son and dil had been gifted an old beater Nissan Sentra from her grandparents that nobody was driving because they all 3 had their own cars.\n\nI asked my son to ask his wife (L) if I could rent it from them for 6 weeks (in other words, pay them for the privilege of using a car nobody else was using to help prepare me for a very serious surgery).\n\nL went off the rails about my audacity again telling me how unbelievable I was.\n\nThen, her mother chimed in with a text saying \"why do you always have to start trouble between C and L?
