Grow a spine. Cut her.", "I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid numerous times and have attended many weddings (including my own) over the years. I\u2019ve never known a bride to require her bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle. That seems very excessive and controlling. Since you\u2019ve already made an exception for this particular bridesmaid, why not let ALL the bridesmaids choose their own hairstyle? That way this bridesmaid\u2019s hair style won\u2019t stand out so much. Are you so insecure that you don\u2019t want your bridesmaids to choose flattering hairstyles?", "NTA\n\nShe's definitely playing games with you, especially the wearing white bullshit...giving you unnecessary problems at literally every turn\n\nJust do yourself a favor and drop her...or if you really really want to keep her, tell her exactly what the dress/color/hair etc is gonna be. Period.", "Since when is pink not a rainbow colour?? It\u2019s literally the third colour in the rainbow song! \n\nMy wedding was 15 years ago and my advice to you is to let go of the petty stuff - shit is going to go wrong regardless of how hard you try to control it. You can decide how much you want to let these imperfections affect your enjoyment of your wedding day.

Focus on what is important and let the rest be what it is.", "I think you probably should tell her that. I think the only issue I have is you using the phrase \"All the colors of the rainbow\". Maybe I'm the only one but I thought that phrase meant ANY color and did not realize (as I just looked up) it specifically meant ROYGBIV..... There are shades of those colors though.... But I'm arguing semantics now and they don't really matter as she picked white next .... That and the hair... she's unreasonable and shouldn't be in your wedding period sounds like.", "If someone told me I could wear any colour of the rainbow, I would not take it that literally. Usually when people say that they simply mean any colour. That being said, I think it is ridiculous to tell people what colour they can wear to a bridal shower. \n\nI also wouldn't worry about how my bridesmaids had their hair done. This is a good thing, too, because I just realized that my MOH had pretty much an identical style to mine. I never even thought of this until now because with different colouring, figures, heights, etc, we still looked pretty different.\n\nYou will be the radiant bride in your gorgeous gown and nobody can take that away from you. Relax a bit and let your bridesmaids have fun and feel good about their appearance, too.", "Y.T.A. Grow a backbone and kick her out of your wedding.", "ESH. No one will notice her hairstyle.

It is rather presumptuous to want the same hairstyle you have.  However, I think you may be being too controlling on having everyone have the same style instead of some range of updo styles.  I also think you being too controlling with what is worn to the bridal shower (since when do bridal showers have color dress codes?)", "ESH - eh, she seems difficult but - so do you. \n\nDress is fine but the exact same hairstyle?

That's the one thing you should have allowed. I grt it, the bride decides a lot of things, but the bridal shower attire, too? In all other respects, you are NTA. I'm assuming the dress is nice.

Think maybe change your mind about her being a bride\u2019s maid as she doesn\u2019t seem pleased with anything about your wedding plans. As a guest she probably will dress like a bride.

The real question is how to summon up courage and kick this bridesmaid out", "NTA. It\u2019s not uncommon for brides to have different hairstyles than their bridesmaids (for my own wedding it was my hair up, theirs down)", "NTA, kind of. You are doing yourself and your fianc\u00e9 a disservice by not standing up to someone you don\u2019t particularly like and who makes rude remarks about your fianc\u00e9. You don\u2019t want your memory of your wedding day to involve stress about this person. Sometimes stress about family members is unavoidable. But a now-distant friend? Not worth it. Stand up for your fianc\u00e9 as well as yourself. \n\nRe the your actual question - based just on the hair, I\u2019d say NTA. Demanding people wear set colours to a bridal shower seems overly controlling and kind of demeaning to me but I don\u2019t want to judge on that because you\u2019re in an uncomfortable situation with this apparently pushy Nola. It seems like the real problem is keeping her involved at all. \n\nGood luck and I hope you and your fianc\u00e9 enjoy your wedding with minimal stress.", ">Uh, sorry but pink isn't a rainbow color.\n\nLyrics to \"I can sing a rainbow\" :  \n\nRed and yellow and **PINK** and green, purple and orange and blue.
