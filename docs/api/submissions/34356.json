Grow a spine. Cut her.", "I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid numerous times and have attended many weddings (including my own) over the years. I\u2019ve never known a bride to require her bridesmaids to have the same hairstyle. That seems very excessive and controlling. Since you\u2019ve already made an exception for this particular bridesmaid, why not let ALL the bridesmaids choose their own hairstyle? That way this bridesmaid\u2019s hair style won\u2019t stand out so much. Are you so insecure that you don\u2019t want your bridesmaids to choose flattering hairstyles?", "NTA\n\nShe's definitely playing games with you, especially the wearing white bullshit...giving you unnecessary problems at literally every turn\n\nJust do yourself a favor and drop her...or if you really really want to keep her, tell her exactly what the dress/color/hair etc is gonna be.

It\u2019s literally the third colour in the rainbow song! \n\nMy wedding was 15 years ago and my advice to you is to let go of the petty stuff - shit is going to go wrong regardless of how hard you try to control it. You can decide how much you want to let these imperfections affect your enjoyment of your wedding day.

Focus on what is important and let the rest be what it is.", "I think you probably should tell her that. I think the only issue I have is you using the phrase \"All the colors of the rainbow\".

But I'm arguing semantics now and they don't really matter as she picked white next .... That and the hair... she's unreasonable and shouldn't be in your wedding period sounds like.", "If someone told me I could wear any colour of the rainbow, I would not take it that literally. Usually when people say that they simply mean any colour. That being said, I think it is ridiculous to tell people what colour they can wear to a bridal shower. \n\nI also wouldn't worry about how my bridesmaids had their hair done. This is a good thing, too, because I just realized that my MOH had pretty much an identical style to mine. I never even thought of this until now because with different colouring, figures, heights, etc, we still looked pretty different.\n\nYou will be the radiant bride in your gorgeous gown and nobody can take that away from you. Relax a bit and let your bridesmaids have fun and feel good about their appearance, too.", "Y.T.A. Grow a backbone and kick her out of your wedding.", "ESH. No one will notice her hairstyle.

It is rather presumptuous to want the same hairstyle you have.  However, I think you may be being too controlling on having everyone have the same style instead of some range of updo styles.  I also think you being too controlling with what is worn to the bridal shower (since when do bridal showers have color dress codes?)", "ESH - eh, she seems difficult but - so do you. \n\nDress is fine but the exact same hairstyle?

The real question is how to summon up courage and kick this bridesmaid out", "NTA. It\u2019s not uncommon for brides to have different hairstyles than their bridesmaids (for my own wedding it was my hair up, theirs down)", "NTA, kind of. You are doing yourself and your fianc\u00e9 a disservice by not standing up to someone you don\u2019t particularly like and who makes rude remarks about your fianc\u00e9. You don\u2019t want your memory of your wedding day to involve stress about this person. Sometimes stress about family members is unavoidable. But a now-distant friend? Not worth it. Stand up for your fianc\u00e9 as well as yourself. \n\nRe the your actual question - based just on the hair, I\u2019d say NTA. Demanding people wear set colours to a bridal shower seems overly controlling and kind of demeaning to me but I don\u2019t want to judge on that because you\u2019re in an uncomfortable situation with this apparently pushy Nola. It seems like the real problem is keeping her involved at all. \n\nGood luck and I hope you and your fianc\u00e9 enjoy your wedding with minimal stress.", ">Uh, sorry but pink isn't a rainbow color.\n\nLyrics to \"I can sing a rainbow\" :  \n\nRed and yellow and **PINK** and green, purple and orange and blue.

I have had the color of shoes/jewelry dictated though.\n\nAnd it's NOT too much to just ask people to wear a certain color. They're your bridesmaids, not just random guests. You have a theme for the shower. It's the same as if you asked everyone to wear a special T-shirt to the bachelorette. These are more requests than the most loosey goosey bridesmaids situations I've been in, but kinda on par with the average ones. \n\nI also immediately thought ROYGBIV with rainbow colors but I'm gay and I guess we take our rainbows seriously \ud83e\udd23\n\nAnyway, NTA, you're making pretty basic requests and this girl is saying no to all of them, she's not a team player and doesn't deserve to be your bridesmaid.", "Yeah, whereas OP said \"I'd be fine with any hairstyle, as long as it's not the one hairstyle I'm wearing at my wedding\". This \"friend\" is insisting to wear the same hairstyle as the bride for her wedding, that's not the same as a demanding bride.\n\nEta: to add what OP said in another comment: \"The bridesmaids picked, not me, we went with majority vote\"", "Your SIL is a jerk. My hair absolutely won\u2019t part the other dude ton because of cowlicks, if someone forced me to make it go the opposite direction, it would look utterly rediculous. Imagine cutting off a friendship because of the wrong direction of hair\u2026", "French twist? Curly up-do? Puffy braids? \n\nMessy bun screams low-effort. It will not look elegant at all. Is that what you want?", "Great idea, so you will gain a scene and a cleaning bill at your wedding \ud83d\ude12", "For the wedding yes, but for a shower? Maybe my friends are just low maintenance.", "Not just remove her from the bridal party. She needs to be Completely disinvited. She's going to show up dressed in white with her hair done up like OP's. \nBetter have some security on hand.\nNTA", "I\u2019m stealing this!  It\u2019s a fabulous line", "Yeah it comes down to friend groups I\u2019ve had friends who\u2019ve wanted everything to look how they wanted so it\u2019s not uncommon and normally it isn\u2019t that much of an issue", "> All colours are made up from those three - you must have learned that in your physics classes?\n\nSpeaking of physics class, fwiw, color theory is not actually how rainbows work.  The sun is emitting full spectrum white light, which gets separated into the spread out \"rainbow\" by rain droplets.  All those other colors are actually there, it's not just combinations of RGB.", "This! She'll definitely show up looking for trouble... in white. NTA.", "Huh. Yeah, in my circles, asking your friend to buy a different brightly-colored dress because pink isn\u2019t rainbowy enough would be considered pretty entitled for anything but the main event. But responding with \u201cfine then I\u2019ll wear white\u201d makes it clear who the asshole is here!", "I think it was a culture thing. As a Brit, American weddings sicken me. Unfortunately, all the worst parts are becoming common here, too. The sheer waste of it all, the audacity of the bridezillas, the meddling mothers, the expense the guests have to go to. I'd be horrified to be invited to one. \n\nCan't wait to elope by ourselves!", "Are you suggesting that someone needs to have red wine available?", "With all due respect, the comments aren't excusing her - they're telling you to look at yourself too.", ">Your other bridesmaids are affected by this. You\u2019re affected by this. Your groom is affected and everyone at your wedding will be too.\n\nAt this rate, this conflict is going to be one of her core wedding memories, forever. Is that what she wants?", "Because she knows you're too pathetic to stand up for yourself & your fiance and kick the girl out. She did it out of pity, not because she wants to spend her day doing that.", "Glad you were able to make things work. Congratulations on your wedding! It will be over so quick, I cannot stress enough to you that this is just one day of the rest of your beautiful lives together. Don't sweat the small stuff!"]}
