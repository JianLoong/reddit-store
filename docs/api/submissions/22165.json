I understand wanting to have more control over the spaces specific to you. But you are already lucky you have biggest room with the most storage space. Like you could salvage this if you didnt throw everything out and maybe put it in the living room and said to your parents to find a place for them. You are an asshole for making a decision without informing them and for throwing away stuff which was not yours.
