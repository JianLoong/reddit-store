For example, my school system would have summer school and other special programs, like summer camps run through the town, running. August is when most take their vacations \n\nYour coworker needed to put her days in quick. She can ask to move, but needs to accept a \"no\" without petty insults", "NTA, she needs to figure out her schedule. Having kids is not a reason to be an entitled deuchebag", "NTA I try to accommodate my coworkers when I can. I probably wouldn\u2019t be willing to work with her in the topic of time off since she\u2019s being an AH.\n\nIt\u2019s too common a mindset that people who\u2019ve chosen certain lifestyles/made certain life choices are inherently more important. Disney isn\u2019t going anywhere. It\u2019s on her to plan better. Or make other times work for her if it\u2019s that important. It isn\u2019t an emergency.\n\nWith that, I\u2019d be tempted to just smile at her if she approaches you again. \u201cJanice, you\u2019re so silly. We\u2019ve discussed this before. I can show you how to access the calendar on your computer if that\u2019ll help you plan better.\u201d", "NTA. Most of the school's calendars are available at least a year in advance (at least in my area), so Janice could print a copy of the 2023/2024 school calendar and do her requests now. \n\nIt doesn't hurt to ask, but Janice became the asshole when she started complaining.", "This post is almost identical to an older post. This is a copycat looking for karma.", "NTA. Your time is not less valuable because she *chose* to reproduce. What arrangements she has to make are her problem. Take your holidays.", "NTA.\n\n\nHaving kids doesn't mean you get special privileges. She should have planned ahead.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with ASKING a coworker, but once the answer is no, that's it.\n\nA previous job, my fellow supervisor and I would swap our time off as needed.  For example:  She needed Christmas Days for her kids, I needed Christmas Eves with my family. So no matter how we were scheduled originally we'd make the arrangements ourselves. But if anyone came to me and demanded it, no way.", "NTA\nNo explanation needed. You booked them first, it's your holiday. Did Janice's kid just fall from the sky yesterday or was she aware that she has a child and school holidays happen at the same time evey year? This is Janice's problem. You don't get to whinge about not booking your holidays in time. Get in early next year Janice!", "NTA. And the age old adage \"You snooze you lose.\" Comes up. Sorry Janice try again next year.", "[removed]", "NTA", "NTA\nYou don\u2019t own her anything", "NTA- she\u2019s entitled & she doesn\u2019t deserve special treatment just because she has a kid", "NTA\n\nYou followed the rules and prepared early.  Their lack of preparedness is not your problem.  \n\nIf others continue to give you grief, ask them if they are going to pay for your new flights, accommodations and a stipend for the stress for ruining your plans.  Again, you have a right to take any holiday that is available.  Her fault for not planning.", "NTA.  She should have planned ahead like you did.  She has a kid?  So do millions of other people in the world.", "NTA  she is not entitled to any special consideration because she had unprotected sex.  Her choice to wait too long to put in her vacation request does not create a conflict for you.", "Definitely NTA.\nAs you said, you put your request in waaay before and it\u2019s on a first come first serve basis so you did nothing wrong \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nJanice should have been more up to speed if she really needed that time off.", "NTA  She is.  I would consider reporting her to HR.  This was poor planning on her part not yours.  Not sure why the end of July wont work for her but thats on her.\n\nShe does not have the right to bitch about you or slander you at work.  That is harassment.  She needs to know if she keeps it up she can be fired.", "NTA\n\nI don't have children + I do the exact same as you and put all my holidays in for the year at the same time, I tend to stick to the same times to spread my holidays throughout the year but if someone gets in first then I'll pick different dates.\n\nNone of my colleagues with kids do this + I don't get it. The school holidays are the same every year but they wait to put holidays in + then complain that they can't have the time off they want.\n\nThe fact you don't have kids is irrelevant, it's first come first served + you got in first, if your coworker wanted that time off she should've been more organised.", "NTA\n\nYou followed the rules, she didn't so she has no ground to stand on. Anything she says to anyone is just petty and harassment.\n\nHypothetically: if and only if you were to consider this. I would ask her to cover the costs to move all my travel arrangements. I'd bet that she would balk at that and say she couldn't afford it, putting her right back at AH status even if you did offer to swap.", "The next time you \"hear\" her complain tell her \"You know what since you have been so nice in asking I have decided to change. Since I have booked flights and hotel plus event tickets I need all that money back. It totaled (make up an amount 2 or 3 times what you paid) so if you can pay me that back I'll be happy to let you have the time. I would need full payment by (date within 1 - 2 weeks) before I cancel everything.\". \n\nHeck of she gives you the money great you just made money but missed an event. If she does not want to pay the next time you \"hear\" her complain tell her you offered a solution that would work for you that she refused and it is not your problem any more. \n\nMake sure everyone knows you offered to cancel but she refused the offer. Don't go into more details.", "NTA-Her lack of planning doesn\u2019t constitute your problem.", "NTA\n\nJanice is an asshole, especially trying to recruit people to dislike you for not giving up your planned vacation for her.\n\nThe rest of the world doesn\u2019t stop because someone\u2019s kid is out of school. You applied for the weeks that worked for you and your life, and you were approved because you applied early. People who don\u2019t have kids also have milestones to celebrate and events they want to attend.\n\nThat\u2019s it. There is nothing more complicated happening here. There is nothing unethical happening here. Janice isn\u2019t owed the pick of weeks because she has a kid.\n\nIf a certain time becomes highly competitive, it might be good for the company to institute a rotation or lottery for those weeks - but this just sounds like Janice didn\u2019t plan, and may not have had any plans until the company was requiring people to sort leave.\n\nHopefully graduating university means you\u2019ll be on to a new career shortly, because sheesh.", "NTA. It doesn't matter if you took the best or worst times off. Its fine that parents ask, its fine for you to say no. Being childless doesn't lessen you or your time and doesn't entitle parents preferential treatment in this case", "NTA. Your title is misleading, making me think you were talking about one of your parents. \n\nAnyways, you have to obligation to make changes to your plans you made in advance to accommodate a coworker.", "Plus July doesn't belong solely to parents. Everyone should be able to have a holiday that month if they want.", "Lol HR is non existent here.

Time off is first come first served. This shit with parents harassing child free employees to swap became an issue. He instituted a policy that you CANNOT ask an employee to swap ever - you ask Human Resources to see if anyone is willing to change. Once - u can ask once and when u get your answer that\u2019s it, no going to coworkers directly. It worked, the few times it was violated written warnings were issued. \nTelling employees to ask coworkers themselves to swap is lazy and bad management!", "Frustrates me too & I am a parent to 2 sons.  Janice, get your shite together!", "I don't blame you one bit, esp. since you already paid for everything. Having kids should not automatically move you to the front of the line. NTA\n\nI do hate the 'first come, first served' system though. I know you said more than one person can be off at a time but it still sounds like people can get screwed by it. \n\nMy mom was a manager and had to deal with all the problems that came with this system all the time. She had one employee who would come to her on January 2 morning with her whole year of vacations/time off requests planned out. She'd barge into my mom's office first thing because she wanted all the best holidays and because she was always first everyone else would get shafted. Finally my mom had to be like, \"You took the week of Christmas last year and the year before that. You can't take it this year too.\" The employee complained to upper management but they told her my mom had the power to reject whatever requests she wanted. My mom tried over and over to get the system changed from 'first come, first served' to a rotating schedule (i.e. - Amy gets Christmas and 4 of July while Bob gets Labor Day and Thanksgiving, then they switch next year) but could never get upper management to approve.", "This should be brought up with HR.  She's deliberately creating a hostile work environment because she 1.) Didn't plan ahead for a school vacation schedule that is basically THE SAME EVERY YEAR!!!! and 2.) Is actively riling up co-workers to take sides on what should be a non-issue.  How these people function in the real world is beyond me.", "Ouch! The pooch must really be sore.", "This is a rather wild think to say given the information provided by the OP.", "Her issue is with management, not you. Her harrassment campaign is inappropriate. Is there a manager you can ask to \"settle\" her questions so she no longer approaches you about changing her work schedule?", "If you\u2019re in the UK, she has around 6 weeks school holiday. Why does it have to be your two weeks? You are not using the only time the kids are off, so she should use some of the other 4. NTA by any stretch.", "I love that policy. Thankfully, I work only with people who\u2019s children (if any) are already grown.", "Janet, get your shift together!", "The rotating schedule isn't fair either as things like \"Bob worked Christmas last year, but Amy quit this year so surprise Bob we need you to work Christmas again\" happen. I don't have a perfect solution, but I think it would be some combination of the two. Like, pair the holidays and then have a random number generator determine what order the staff picks to have them off in. Or you know, companies actually close on holidays and let their staff have a personal life, but obviously the capitalist overlords will never let that happen.", "And OP is also working around a school schedule, so how is that different?  OP planned ahead and shouldn't have to change.  \n\nNTA", "Planning a holiday is enough of a pain in the neck without having to coordinate with your coworkers, much less moving things around after you've already booked it.", "We had that system when I was in training and it is very hard on families because it is rigid and assigned and if your spouse has to elect time off you never have your schedule known in time to coordinate with your spouse.", "Yes, you're right.  Which is why, before judging, I asked if it was planned and paid for or if he'd just booked the time and was going to figure it out later.  I asked if moving it by a couple of weeks would be an issue.\n\nIf I had no plans for time I'd booked off 10 months in advance, I wouldn't think twice about switching with a woman who wanted to take her kids to Disneyland or wherever.  It's worth more to her than it is to me. I could take my leave a little earlier or later.\n\nBut if I did have solid plans, just like the OP does, or that time frame was special for another reason,  I would say sorry but no, and then I would explain why not to anyone who gave me a hard time about it.\n\nI'm really confused by the negativity my comments are getting, especially that other poster who seems to think that \"Fuck off, life is tough and I got here first.\" is all the justification a person needs not to switch and do someone a favour.  What kind of person thinks that way?"]}
