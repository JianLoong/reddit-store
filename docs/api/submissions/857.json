{"id": 857, "submission_id": "yjp6yr", "title": "AITA for suggesting to pay for only half of the payment to help my fianc\u00e9\u2019 sister?", "selftext": "So my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family is in a difficult time right now with his sisters husband needing to get a surgery done. I know this sister doesn\u2019t have a lot since she\u2019s a stay at home mom and he\u2019s a missionary. None of their children work since they are all underaged (there are about 3 children). My fianc\u00e9e wants to help them out by sending money, about $5,000. I told him its nice for him to do that and then he asked for my help. \n\nSo a few things about our financial situation, we both have a very stable life and we don\u2019t have children yet. He earns more than i do but is terrible when it comes to saving and i earn a good amount of money that i am able to afford a few things for myself. This year I was able to afford to go on 2 vacations with him but those vacations dont even last a week and they are mostly on a strict budget (note: the first vacation is fully paid by me and it took me about 1 year to save and the other was a split). I have a few savings account one for my school (since im planning to go back in 2 years) and one for my retirement savings. I pay for most of our bills because he cant keep up due to his spending habits and then he pays me back after 2 weeks or so. The food is usually covered by me (about 60% of groceries and take out). When we moved in together, 50% was paid by me, 15% from my parents and the rest from him. I was never bothered by it because i knew his situation and he was going through a tough time. He got better now but he still has a few things to work through.\n\nSo when he asked me for help, i told him that i am willing to help but not $5,000 just maybe half of it and we can work on saving $2,500. I can tell it bothered him that i only wanted to do half of $5,000, so i reminded him about my plans to go to school. He got quiet then txted his mom if his sister needs help. After dinner, we cuddled on the couch when he received a txt from his mom saying that he should ask his sister instead. He got really mad and thinks that his family is trying to shun him and so i tried to explain to him that sometimes asking for financial help is an awkward thing but he didnt understand my point so he kept getting more mad and yelled at me that im an asshole cause i just dont want to help his family and i am trying to talk him out of it\u2026.so AITA?", "created_utc": 1667345987, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjp6yr/aita_for_suggesting_to_pay_for_only_half_of_the/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Step back and think about it. \n\nYou are NTA - but he is. He will run through whatever savings you have + some. Don't do it and reconsider this marriage.", "NTA.  You are helping them more than I would want to.  He can send however much money he wants, I would want to be left out of it.  He makes more than you do but saves less?  That is a recipe for trouble.  And now he is pressuring you to give money to his family.  This guy is treating you like an ATM.  Are you sure that you want to marry this guy?", "NTA. He is being irresponsible. Let him be irresponsible with his own money, after he has contributed his fair share to the living costs the two of you have. It doesn't sound as if he is doing that now. Tell him it is easy to be a \"do-gooder\" with other people's funds. I am seing red flags here.", "NTA - you keep saving YOUR money for YOUR future.", "NTA. He makes more than you and pays less in every aspect of y\u2019all\u2019s shared life. He\u2019s expecting you to chip in more than 50% yet again because he\u2019s used to you covering for him. He\u2019s trying to guilt you into doing this, which is inappropriate to say the least. \n\nYou need better financial boundaries with this man. He is a grown ass man and he can\u2019t even control himself well enough to have his share of the bills on time. He needs to get help for his spending habit and you need to stop enabling him.", "NTA Okay, as far as your actual question, of course you are not the asshole. But this is only part of a much bigger issue. Your fiance makes more money than you do, but you cover the majority of the expenses because of his spending habits. Okay, yeah, you get some of that money back eventually and that's nice, but this is a problem. You need to get this situation straightened out now, because it's going to get so much more complicated once you're married.\n\nAnd as for this situation with his family, you are not obligated to help them. And the way he treated you is unacceptable. This is a large sum of money he's basically demanding from you. You were being EXTREMELY generous offering the 2,5000, I'm genuinely appalled that he felt it was perfectly fine to throw a fit over you not just handing over $5,000.", "NTA. Half is better than nothing and his own money management is why paying the whole amount is an issue.", "NTA\n\nYou have been incredibly patient and understanding and generous with your fiance. Honestly his behavior is very disconcerting. He is being completely emotionally manipulative and playing on your kindness and that is not ok! Give him a boundary and then stick to it! Good luck!", "NTA.\n\nPlease, please, have serious discussions about money, finances, and everything before the wedding. You've got to be 100% on the same page or willing to compromise.\n\nHe can learn to be better with his money, but he doesn't have to, because he's got you to pick up the slack. You pay for all the vacations and he makes as much as you?\n\nAnd it's YOUR financial situation and HIS financial situation until you combine finances once married.\n\n$2500 is a generous amount, regardless. It's kind of you to say \"yes\" and offer what you did. Choosy beggar he is.", "So the outside perspective here is that you are being **very generous** by gifting $2500 to your husband's sister. You're not under some obligation to give them the full amount they ask for (or anything). If they are shunning you or your husband for not fully opening up your checkbook, that's just showing you what kind of people they are... And keep that in mind when considering if you want to help them again in the future. \n\nNTA.", "Respect your money... Coz he for sure does not respect you. 2500 is a looot.", "NTA it is unfair and wrong that you are paying most of the costs in your relationship when he earns more and makes up the excuse he is bad at saving. What exactly does he do to benefit your life?", "Nta. With school and the wedding coming up (assuming since you said fiance) most of your income can me tied up. Maybe this will help him learn to save. He could just be mad at himself cause if he had learned he wouldn't have to ask you or his mom for financial help. Can they ask their church for help like maybe fo a special offering for the surgery?", "If you stay with him he will always expect you to sacrifice your wants and needs for him while never reciprocating. Why are you the one who has to provide for his family? He wants the credit of helping out without actually doing the work. \n\nThink of all of the things you've already given up for him. Has he ever given up anything for you? He sounds like a selfish mooch who is taking advantage of your good habits with money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
