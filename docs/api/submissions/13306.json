First of all i'm very sorry you had to go through all this (from the divorce to the discoovery of the cheating passing through the evil behaviour of you're step-mother), you have all the right to live you're life in the happiest way possible and you deserve to be surrounded by people who love you, especially on the wedding day, a day so important that it is supposed to be spent in joy. That's why she doesn't deserve to be present, not only was she an accomplice in the destruction of your family but because of her unjustified jealousy she behaved in an unacceptable way towards you doing everything to get you away from your father (unfortunately succeeding) causing you pain that you didn't deserve. As far your father, I understand that you love him and that you want him present on such an important day for you, however, it is good that you prepare yourself for the worst possible scenario, that is, the one in which he will not be present, this because he has already clearly demonstrated to you what are his priorities and that he doesn't have the courage to rebel against his wife's actions (which I find disgusting especially since from what I've read he has acknowledged the negative attitudes he had from her in the past which makes his doing nothing even worse). So if i were you i would use marriage as a last attempt to mend the relationship and if things were to go wrong i would remove him permanently from my life eliminating even the small contacts left this because there is no point in trying to continue a relationship that is totally one way. I wish you te best for the future hoping this story comes to a happy ending.\n\nP.S: i'm sorry if i made some grammar mistakes but english is not my main language", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
