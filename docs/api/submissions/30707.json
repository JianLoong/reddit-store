His sister and BIL are refusing to buy a car for reasons I don\u2019t understand. They can obviously afford it, as they easily spent a trip for four to Burning Man from Australia this year and every year for some years before COVID.\n\nTheir house is paid off, and the husband makes $200-300k annually at least, or possibly more. Whereas I don\u2019t make as much money, and I work three jobs - sometimes 10-hour shifts, six days a week. Of course, I am bitter about them using my car because I work hard to pay for this car in cash from my hard-earned labor, and I don\u2019t own a house.\n\nThey have a child that needs specialist appointments, so they would ask me to take them when my boyfriend is away, but I refuse because I\u2019m mostly working, and only my boyfriend and I are insured to drive my car. And they can definitely afford to get an Uber.\n\nMy boyfriend puts petrol in the car, but I pay for everything else - registration, insurance, maintenance, new tint, tires, and repairs.\n\nThey said they don\u2019t need a car because they can just order an Uber, take public transport, or ride their bikes everywhere, and they can save money by not owning a big expense like a car.\n\nSo I asked my boyfriend why he is using my car to drive them when they told me they don\u2019t have a need for a car. He thinks I\u2019m evil, and we\u2019re currently on silent terms, and he will be using my car to ferry them around tomorrow while I\u2019ll be doing overtime this weekend.\n\nBtw, I don\u2019t have a problem with him driving them - just not with my car.\n\nEdit: He begged me to borrow the car coz his niece is going horse riding and he\u2019s organised to drive them, and he promised this will be the last time. I agreed, this is definitely the last time because I told him we are done and I\u2019m moving to my own place on my own.

Plus the cab fare to the tow yard, which was in the next down and not walkable... Over all, it cost us well over $200.\n\nShe didn't speak to us again. She blamed us for her arrest, because \"I never would have gotten pulled over if he'd just gotten the inspection taken care of!\" And that we didn't help with (or pay!) her bail was just fuel to the fire...

I spend maybe $200 dollars a month, in the US, on Uber and the like. That gets me to the places I need that I can't walk to, and saves me tons of money and energy I'd be using on car maintenance. Sometimes, rarely, I borrow vehicles or accept rides because that saves even more money and time, but I'd still be massively better off if I never borrowed cars and only used taxi services than I would be if I bought a car.\n\nIt would be better financially to share the car, and the expenses associated with it.

I have an ex that sat around and ate all my food and trashed my house while I was working 40 hours a week, and trash talked my family for not \"helping\" us, when he couldn't hold down a job longer than a month. Anyone who doesn't give money to dead beats are \"selfish and stingy!\"\n\nMy only regret was not leaving him sooner", "We all must live in the same area and have dated that same guy...lollll", "Yeah i could buy ap apartment if i would not feed this leech and his family. Better to learn young tho. I faced another leech right after him and that was fast process. Both leeches were also selling drugs, which I had no idea because I was 18/19 and naive. The first one was upset I did not let him grow weed at our home. The second was selling hardcore drugs so I had to move elsewhere. I said I was broke and had to move \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude02.", "I actually broke up with a guy because he ate too much of my food that I paid for and he did not. Then it came to a head one day when I cooked 2 lb of hamburger meat into burgers and a couple of bags of chicken breast to last all week. Plus I bought lunch meat and cheese I thought we were set for lunches. He ate all of it by Tuesday from Sunday! Leech is going to leech NTA dump his ass! In my case, you don't mess with a fat girls food", "Alright. No sex until marriage then. Let me see how much true love men have for their women. 50/50 means women will go hard while man will act like stupid child that can do nothing and will discrespect as a spice to the relationship.", "Good relationships are never fully 50/50 in any regard. Sometimes they are 60/40, then maybe 30/70, and maybe briefly 50/50... A good relationship is one that doesn't count percentages bc it doesn't need to; it adapts as needs change. This goes for household responsibilities, emotional support, finances, time together and time apart. There can be basic outlines (you cook, I'll clean; you wash clothes, I'll fold; you pay utilities and food, I'll pay rent;...) but if the situation changes, briefly or long term (you had a hard day so I'll cook AND clean; you just took a cut in pay, so I'll cover rent AND groceries; or you just got a raise, you cover a little of the rent, too...) Putting the needs of your partner ahead of your own (but not at the expense of your own) works well when both partners do it bc each partner places value on and prioritizes the needs of the other. Keeping a tally just results in resentment bc each partner will feel cheated at some point.\n\nOP does not hv a partner who prioritizes her needs -- he doesn't even acknowledge she has needs!! OP is so NTA!! As my husband says, DTMFA! (dump the mf'er already!) You deserve someone SO MUCH BETTER! Find someone who loves and respects you, supports your needs and wants, contributes to all aspects of your relationship, and, this one is very important, someone who makes you laugh some every day, even on the worst days, or possibly, most importantly on the worst days. Good luck!!", "A lot of leeches survive long time relationship. There are women out there who would be baby mamas to three four men, provide for them kids, for the \u201cman\u201d, pay all the bills etc and all for something as insignificant as a sentence \u201cI love you\u201d. I am a true gold digger and I can tell you none of my exes ever felt bad about the situation because they knew damn well what I give them is more precious then those money. They can always make more money, I can never get back those months and years I gave them.", "YTA. How is this even a question? \n\nYou broke up with your boyfriend because he drives his sister and her kid to doctor\u2019s appointments?", "THIS RIGHT HERE OP^ NTA", "This is the answer OP^", "Have you reached reading the end of my post? Coz they took my car to go horse riding today.", "You are correct, I'm not American. But I am British and we use miles over kilometres. Also absolutely no offence taken!\n\nI'm not sure what the equivalent would be when refering to KM in the same way.", "He can go date a girl who also believes in owning nothing", "Have you read the burning boy creed? Something about not leaving a trace, but also something about self-reliance. He may feel superior to others because he doesn\u2019t have a car, may feel people who own cars are bad for the environment. Let him think whatever the flip he wants to think. Brass tax: His sister needs to be more self-reliant. How dare she not have safer transportation for her child when she can afford it!  \n\nBut YOU need to bring your horse with you to work. Quit being codependent on his needing you. \n\nHe is not someone with whom you are balanced. You need someone who builds a life WITH you, not someone who resents you and uses you in the same emotion. QUIT MAKING HIM OUT TO BE WHAT YOU WANT HIM TO BE. You\u2019re obviously a complete badass, and you deserve someone as amazing as you! \n\nI am so sorry, and we have ALL been there. The next chapter of your life will be a much better read. Sending LOTS of love your way!!!", "50/50? You\u2019re dreaming. He wants to pay even less for his share of the rent to me when we move to the new unit than his share of the rent currently. Obviously he knows we will have more bills to cover but I have to pay all that by myself because it\u2019s my house, and the bills are not his obligations, according to him. So he can stay where he is and pay for all his rent.", "I'm in a metric-system country, and I use \"mileage.\" The other way of saying it is, \"How many clicks on the odometer, eh?\" ;)", ">So he can stay where he is and pay for all his rent.\n\nYay!! \ud83c\udf89", "Run, don't walk. Get away from this loser. Never give him a key, and never take his calls again. He will not change. Remove him from your car insurance and any credit cards you may share. You are his meal ticket, his part-time job, his live-in maid. You are not equals. Grown-up men take care of their part of the business. Cry Baby, whiny boys will take your money forever! I hope you enjoy your new apartment!  Don't even think about giving him your new telephone number or address! Yes, that means changing your number!", "I feel like half the posts here have that as the solution\u2026 we need a new acronym to vote on, DTA dump the A", "Incusucc?", "\ud83e\udd23", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 i live in europe\u2026. But maybe relatives??\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "The guy I mentioned up thread, he finally got a job and he spent his entire first paycheck on his own wardrobe right before Xmas. I was devastated, as I had moved across country twice to be with him - because of money problems. I told him I just wanted to feel like he thought about me, or appreciated me and a simple gift like a flower or a card would've gone a long way. He then bought me a box of swedish fish (my least favorite candy) and told me that my wallowing in self pity was getting depressing. I booked a plane ticket home the next day.", "What an ass! Glad you didn't tolerate that and left"]}
