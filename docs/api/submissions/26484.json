I've never been to a baby shower where the parents didn't specify a certain brand of diapers or wipes, it's like telling people what size of clothes your kids wear. The baby shower is a social gathering that is literally about gifting new parents with things for the baby so there is no way specifying what you want is tacky.

The only benefit of getting random brands though is every baby booty is different and it\u2019s a nice way to try them out. I was recommended the \u201ctop\u201d brands but my babe peed through those every time. And other wipe brands gave him a rash and made his face breakout even if they were for sensitive skin.

(Hint: it was *not* the brand I had assumed would be my favorite, based on popularity.)", "I definitely just give friends a GC for like Walmart and write on it with a sharpie saying to use it to buy diapers/wipes. Baby bums are so unpredictable about what kind they'll prefer, so I don't gift actual diapers. Buuuuut.

Diaper prices are no joke, and add up.  I don't see anything wrong with it at all.", "I would say diapers are fine and by size but not brand specific. Only because you don\u2019t know what brand will work best for this baby. Skin sensitivities and all that jazz aren\u2019t known during pregnancy so you try different things to see what works best. You\u2019re baby may do better with a brand you wouldn\u2019t normally buy. You just don\u2019t know until you try them. But the general idea is good. It helps avoid the \u201cI don\u2019t know what to get\u201d or the \u201cregistry options were too expensive\u201d", "NTA I had preferred brands told for both of mine. The only one that was wrong was the one where the host said any brand except luvs so someone bought loves. But most everyone else got pampers Huggies or hello bello and my baby ended up only being able to use pampers.", "NTA. We had a registry that included nothing but our preferred brand of diapers and wipes since we had started buying necessities as soon as I found out I was pregnant. We already had all of the clothing, nursery decor and furniture, and accessories that we would need. My husband's family bought us so many boxes of diapers in all sizes and wipes that we didn't have to buy any for a year. \n\nMy family went a bit nuts buying things like glass bottles (I told my mom that we were trying to avoid plastic), cloth diapers, and lots of visa gift cards to be used for necessities that popped up along the way. They shipped everything to us from the US and joined our \"meet the baby\" party via Skype. \n\nDon't listen to family that balks at your asking for what you need. Most people are happy to have the what to buy gifting decision taken off their hands.", "Where I live there is usually a traditional baby shower and the boys have diaper party, everyone brings a box of diapers/wipes and they usually get drunk somewhere.

It also stops you from getting too many of one size.", "NTA I prefer to get you what you want. Diapers are a perfectly reasonable and affordable gift", "NTA. it's logical and realistic to ask for gifts you can actually use and that are most likely not as pricey as the things you usually would buy someone for a baby shower if it's a one-off purchase for the guest. people are probably still gonna call you an AH because reddit has a huge hate boner against gender reveals, baby showers, anything that isn't you just keeping everything about your pregnancy secret, but realistically, you're fine.", "NTA. Diapers and wipes are great requests.", "NTA You\u2019re doing your guests a favor giving that kind of info, it takes the guesswork out of it. In the south this kind of a shower is called a \u201cdiaper pound\u201d.", "NTA, it\u2019s essentially no different than having a baby registry and having sending it to everyone to make a purchase. Actually it\u2019s easier and I would be thrilled to just buy diapers and not have to search for the exact item, color, and size on the registry.", "NTA.  I always appreciate knowing what people want and need when it comes having to buy them a gift.", "As a mom who is expecting her second, Nta and not tacky. I plan to do the same if I have a second baby shower. My first I got all kinds of brands and I tried them all out, but now I know which I prefer and as long as LO doesn\u2019t have any allergies to what I prefer im going to continue to use what I like and works for us.", "NTA I have be a hostess for many baby showers in my time. The most recent one was in July. Every single shower where I have done a diaper raffle as part of it, it has included 1 or 2 choices for diaper brands. Not tacky at all.

I love a registry because I love knowing that I\u2019m getting something someone will actually use!\n\nIf I wanna add a personal touch I always buy something off the registry and add something small and/or useful and wrap it beautifully (not more clothes though because most new parents have more clothes than they know what to do with and don\u2019t need random things that I think are sweet).", "NTA. Idk if its bc of my shit reading comprehensiom, but i dont see the problem? Literally the go-to gift in any baby shower i know is diapers.", "Are you saying that each person was given a size and brand. Like Suzy  got a card with size 1 pampers and Lisa got a size 2 pampers? Because  if that\u2019s true where you specifically told them exactly what they were supposed to bring them yes that\u2019s tacky. If it was just sizes 1-4 brand pampers then that\u2019s better although as a mom of 3 kids the brands really aren\u2019t all that different.", "It\u2019s tacky to ask guests to bring a baby shower gift and then also put in an optional diaper raffle. It should be one or the other. It\u2019s tackier still that some of these guests also were invited to bring gifts to a gender reveal. It\u2019s even more tacky to now add a preferred brand and size, particularly when your brand is only available at membership stores. There\u2019s NAH and even your best friend said you were being tacky, not that you\u2019re an ass. You can ask for whatever you want but she\u2019s right, this is not gracious.

Some people are so traditional they don't even believe you can throw your own baby shower or ask for anything specific.

Would be silly if you got 3 bassinets.", "NTA for asking for a specific brand. But I do think it\u2019s tacky to expect a gift and then want diapers on top of it as well. I get it\u2019s optional and I always do bring diapers when this game is requested, not because I care about wining anything but only cause I feel obligated and don\u2019t want to look bad or like I can\u2019t afford it. I just get annoyed when I see it. Same with the \u201cbuy a book for the baby instead of a card\u201d. I get that it\u2019s a good idea in theory, I just don\u2019t like to be told what to bring.  That\u2019s just me though :)", "You\u2019re not an AH, but it\u2019s still tacky.", "Uh yeah.", "Yes, YTA. The kid poops in the diaper and you throw it away. Requesting something that is 'most beneficial for us' also makes no sense. You aren't diapering yourself.", "Gift-grab at the gender reveal (ugh) and now a baby shower?

I'm a firm believer in a gift you don't want is not a gift it's a burden. \nAsking for diapers and specific sizes brands is SMART and useful. Otherwise you could end up with a hundred packages of the nb size that might not even fit your bsby for more than the first day after birth lol and the raffkes are a very commonplace accepted norm nowadays and as youvstated its optional no one has to play. Personally I love duapervraffle, gift registries and little notes in invites that specify things. For people who aren't sure this eases their decision making. Personally I like knowing someone wants and will use what I'm gifting. I even taught my daughters to only go \"off registry\" when they know the recipient well enough or they have credible info the person would like what the gift is. And especially for a baby shower! As you stated the last thing a new mom needs is to be running around trying to do exchanges or store credit for a bunch of cheap she didn't want or doesn't need. My last babyshower I got FOUR stupid wipe warmers. Never wanted even one. Returned them all except for the weird off-brand no name thing I swear the giver must have bought off of Wish.
