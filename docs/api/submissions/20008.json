I went to visit my niece for a week that I haven\u2019t seen for two years because we have lived so far away from each, and other reasons. I FaceTimed my mother multiple times so she could interact with my niece because my mom lives across the country and hasn\u2019t seen my niece since 2019. While FaceTiming my mom, she wanted us to pose so she could take a screenshot of us. I told her \u201cdo not post any of these screenshots\u201d, bc she\u2019s always posting stuff that I request she doesn\u2019t. Well, I reactivated my Facebook last night and saw three days ago, she made the photos her PROFILE PIC. I was livid. I texted her very nicely asking her to delete and that I had even asked her during our FT call she doesn\u2019t post any of the photos. Instead of deleting the photo of me, she changed her PF pic to my nephew. I, again,was LIVID. I called her out and said \u201cdo not change your PF pic, delete IT\u201d. She ignored me and was still on FB interacting with people on her new PF pic. So I screenshotted her interaction and sent them to her with the following text \u201cI can see you\u2019re still awake. Delete my photo\u201d. Well she continued to ignore me. I had a three hour long panic attack and bawled my eyes out. For context, I was in a very toxic/abusive relationship, called fat and ugly for years, and now I feel fat, gross, and ugly. But I shouldn\u2019t have to explain this to her. She has done this since before high school. I would beg her not to post things of me and beg her not to share my secrets or wrong doings with people, and she didn\u2019t care. She would tell everyone and post everything. So I went off on her via text. I blew her phone up, text after text. I didn\u2019t call her names, but I demanded she remove every photo she had ever posted of me on every social media she has. She played the victim and played clueless and tried to say \u201cI know you\u2019re probably going through something\u201d as if she\u2019s not the reason for my reaction. AITA for blowing up her phone and demanding she remove not just the PF pic but every photo she\u2019s ever posted? Maybe I handled it incorrectly. I wasn\u2019t trying to be rude.

Blowing up someone's w texts and calls can definitely be perceived as being the assholes, even though I wasn't trying to be mean towards her.

I reported her account and every photo of me on there, but unfortunately no action was taken.", "Thank you for your response. I think you\u2019re right, it feels like I\u2019m her property when she does this. I tried to explain that it felt like a violation and disrespectful but she belittled me saying \u201call this over a photo\u201d, as the argument continued into this morning over text. I thought about threatening suing, but I didn\u2019t want to stoop that low. I genuinely didn\u2019t want to hurt her in my response to her actions. I struggle with anxiety, panic disorder, ptsd and ocd though, so my reactions can be extreme. I called her nearly 13 times last night and probably sent about 20 texts explain why it was hurtful and demanding she remove it. The response I woke up to was criticism about how I reacted, and the photo was STILL up there. I continued demanding her to remove it and she eventually blocked me bc I wouldn\u2019t call her to speak w her about it. I called her on Snapchat after she blocked my number and eventually got her to remove several photos. I\u2019m hoping me blowing up at her finally will resolve this situation even though I\u2019m still blocked and she doesn\u2019t seem to understand why and how this hurt me. She\u2019s very emotionally immature and it\u2019s a lot to deal with. She kept gaslighting me and trying to mention things I\u2019ve done that have hurt her in the past. It\u2019s been a lot to deal with but I\u2019m really tired of her (and others) doing things without my consent. I barely talk to her these days because of this. She doesn\u2019t know much about my life bc I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing anything w her. She already blabbed to my eldest brother about this whole situation.", "As mentioned I was in an abusive relationship and have had a lot of trauma over my 25 years of life. I have OCD, PTSD, anxiety and panic disorder. I said it may seem extreme which is why I was asking if I\u2019m the AH.  This isn\u2019t over a photo though, she blatantly when behind my back, against my wishes and shared a photo she knew I was be insecure about. And once I asked her to fix her mistake, she didn\u2019t and ignored me. As the argument continued into today, she\u2019s gaslit me, tried to belittle me, and lie. I also mentioned that I didn\u2019t call her names, nor did I say anything hurtful. I was just demanding she take down my photos that she didn\u2019t have permission to post or even take.", "Sorry to hear that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next tool you have is: \"Mom, I am going no contact with you until you respect my boundaries. Send me a text when the pictures are down\". Then do it.", "Legally she can post photos she takes.  The only option therefore is to stop allowing her to take any of you.", "Honestly, I think your best bet is to just cut all ties. FB isn't going to do anything nor is there an easy legal path. I know it's hard but, unless there is material there that is directly life/reputation/career threatening, accept that she's not going to take them down and get this toxic person out of your life.", "I have PTSD too - from growing up with my mother. Her constant nagging, criticizing, punishing, and disrespecting took their toll on my psyche. I suspect you have these disorders at least partly because of your mother. It's pretty common. Check out r/cptsd. I used to feel guilty for my \"overreactions\" but they weren't overreactions. They were appropriate, considering what she did to me.", "> A professional could help you sort out how (or even if) to handle the relationship with your mother.\n\nAgain.", "She already blocked me bc I called her out for her gaslighting and manipulation. She tried to say I sent her that photo and never told her not to post it. I was really angry but tried to nicely correct her that she actually screenshotted the photo during a ft call and I told her over the call. She said she didn\u2019t remember this interaction, taking the photo, or me requesting her not to post it. It\u2019s a mess. I do believe that she didn\u2019t remember doing it, bc she forgets a lot of what she does. I told her she should go see a neurologist and she blocked me after that.", "Yes, unfortunately it is legal. The photo was taken over FT w out my consent technically. But either way I know there isn\u2019t anything I can do. Plus, I wouldn\u2019t go that route either way. She did delete the photo I had originally asked her to remove and she removed a few others though. Finally.", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. I\u2019m sure part of my PTSD is from my mom, but it\u2019s mostly from others that I have endured abuse from. I think my requests were completely valid and what I said was fine. I just know I shouldnt have continued to text and call her though. But I was having an active panic attack. My panic attacks can last minutes to hours and nothing helps. It feels like I\u2019m literally dying, so I thought if I could get this issue resolved faster that maybe my panic attack would end quicker. I would like to say though, I wasn\u2019t having a panic attack bc of a photo but bc it triggered me. I have had a lot of pain from many ppl in my life. My consent and my feelings have never truly been taken into consideration. I have never had a say on how people treat me bc I was a child and couldn\u2019t flee the situation so I was forced to be around and in very toxic and hurtful situations. This lead to me remaining in a toxic relationship when I got older bc I thought I had to stay bc the way I was raised. My mother would continue to bring me around ppl who abused me mentally and emotionally, and encourage psychical abuse.", "I\u2019ve had therapy and even prescriptions for my trauma and disorders. Besides blowing up her phone, I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong. She refuses help. She takes it as an insult when i suggest therapy for her. I have cut her out of my life many times bc the way she is, and bc I know how I\u2019ll react to things, although it\u2019s never my intention to hurt her. But it\u2019s hard not having her in my life. She is in heart failure and is in a toxic relationship. I don\u2019t think I could forgive myself if I cut her out permanently and something happens to her.", "\"She already blocked me\" .. consider that a win.", "I totally empathise with you.  You aren\u2019t over-reacting.  Your mum is being inconsiderate.  Though she is perhaps proud of you and your family and that\u2019s why wants to share your photos. NTA for respecting your boundaries though.", "Time to stop video calling", "My mother tore my self-esteem to shreds. Which led me to find abusive boyfriends. Thankfully I didn't marry any of them. That's what abusive parents do - they make you think you don't deserve anything good, and that if people abuse you, it's your fault.", "Don't light yourself on fire to keep her warm.  She's done enough damage to you already.", "Well I know my mom didn\u2019t try to hurt me. When we\u2019d have arguments she would say really really hurtful things. And she didn\u2019t protect me from toxic and abusive people. But she gave me lots of love and she would raise me up (when we weren\u2019t fighting). I know she loves me, and I her. She was abused by her mom too, like physically and emotionally, so I understand where her behaviors stem from. She\u2019s wasn\u2019t all bad at all tbh, in fact she was so amazing, but there were times where she would say and do really hurtful things in response to me being a normal kid. We were also essentially in a cult until I was about 17. My aunt was a \u201cpastor\u201d and literally controlled my moms every move. She would tell my mom how to discipline us (myself and two brothers). She would tell my mom she should \u201ctithe\u201d to her ($30k+ dollars). All while my aunt was mistreating myself and my brothers. Her daughter, my cousin, was also very abusive towards me especially. She would lock me in crawl spaces and hurt me. And of course my uncle was very mean and hurtful, especially to my two brothers. Sorry it\u2019s a lot lol. I guess I\u2019m just now realizing all the abuse we endured. No wonder why we\u2019re all f***ed up."]}
