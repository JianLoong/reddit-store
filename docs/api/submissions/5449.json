I went to the eye doctor a few weeks ago and decided I should get some new glasses since I've had mine a few years.  \n\nWell my mom and I went to get me some glasses yesterday.  I'm still on her insurance and she wanted to help.\n\nWe walked in and right away this sales lady I'll call Sally asked if we needed help. My mom said \"he needs some glasses\" and I said \"yea but I'm just looking \". \n\nSally started picking out different frames and making me try them on.  None of them we're my style,  and whenever I was looking at pairs I LIKED she'd bother me to come try some she picked on. Not sure if she thought my style was different than it actually is or what but she kept picking out nerdy glasses, types that someone would wear to try to look nerdy. So I said I didn't like them or they were too big on my face, or flat out said I looked like a nerd.  My mom just said \"it's her job to be helpful \".\n\nI was getting more annoyed because I'm buying them but can't even look for something I LIKE. Because Sally kept calling me over to try some on.\n\nSo after probably 10 pairs Sally picked. I said \"I'm not really into those they make me look like a geek\". Sally said \"well I think they look cute on your face maybe you'd get used to them\". \n\nI said \"I don't really care what you think. I'm the one that's buying them and has to wear them.  I don't like those styles\". \n\nThen I told my mom I was leaving and walked outside. \n\nMy mom said I was unnecessarily rude and acted childish.  That the sales lady was just doing her job and trying to help and I acted really immature. She wanted me to go back inside but I refused.  \n\nLast time I got glasses the sales person asked if I needed help, I said no that I was looking,  so they let me look and I told them when I found some I liked. \n\nI don't like being harassed when I'm shopping in general, especially with things that affect my appearance.   I don't really thinks it's that bad to tell a stranger that their opinions don't matter but my mom said it's rude. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671811004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztk9pf/aita_for_telling_a_sales_lady_i_dont_care_about/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are 100% correct - you are the one who has to wear the glasses and the salesperson\u2019s opinion doesn\u2019t matter.

Perhaps a less blunt way was better, but the sales person first step should always be asking what you are looking for. Not push things onto you.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nA salesperson's job is to help the customer if requested. If the customer states they don't need help, the salesperson must respect the customer's wishes. Sally has been borderline to harrassing with you.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m an optician. Helping people choose glasses is my job. Anyone selling glasses should start with, \u201cIs there a particular style you\u2019re looking for?\u201d, then ask lifestyle questions to narrow foe the search. \n\nI tell my patients that I won\u2019t let them get something that\u2019s ugly, because then they\u2019ll tell people where they got them, but the patient\u2019s style choices are their personal preferences.", "NTA.

I was so tired of ending up with glasses I hated I switched to Zenni. I've never been happier with my glasses.", "ESH, Sally is bad at her job but there's basically no excuse for yelling at a staff member in a store. A lot of people come in being indecisive and offering ideas can be helpful for them (though I hate pushy staff too) \u2013 but it's her job to sense what . You can tell her sternly that you prefer to browse on your own, there's no reason to behave like a child. Your mom is absolutely right, it is incredibly rude.\n\nAlso you're 20 years old and shopping with your mom, so I would expect people to assume you're a kid and your mom is really making the purchase not you \u2013 if she was receptive to the sales lady's pitches, she's the 'real' customer for whom the pitch is calibrated.", "I'm going with NTA. You said you were looking. You told her you didn't like the style she was choosing. She made a really stupid statement. She kinda got what was coming to her.", "YTA. If you didn't want the salesperson's inputs, you simply say: \"I'm going to look on my own for a while and if I need help I will come find you. Thanks.\" \n\nThere's no need for rudeness.", "ESH. Sally does sound pushy. But you don't need to be rude; you can simply say 'thankyou for your help but I'd like to browse on my own'.", "ESH. The sales lady was overbearing. Some salespeople have that style because it works for them (or maybe doesn't work but they think it will), and some because that's what the company/their superiors ask of them. Either way, she was annoying and should've picked up the clue that you were not into her suggestions and let you browse alone or offer a different style more similar to what you were trying to pick. \n\nThat said, someone being annoying doesn't mean they have bad intentions, and per your narration she never once said anything rude to you, she was just overbearing. Plus, while you would've preferred to be left alone, your mother did welcome the lady's help so she wasn't out of line for trying. \n\nYou were unnecessarily rude. At 20 you're still young, but old enough to know that establishing boundaries with people doesn't mean being rude and offensive toward them. There was no need to tell her \"I don't really care what you think\" and all that. A simple \"thanks but I just don't like this style and prefer this other kind of frames, can you show me more in this style, or otherwise I'll just pick some myself and call you when I'm ready to check out\" would've sufficed. You acted rude, and childish. \n\nNot the end of the world though. Learn and move on.", "Youre right but also YTA. Be nice. \n\nThough ive been there. I was picking out glasses during covid, and was changing my style so i was trying on a bunch of pairs. The lady said something to the effect of \"we have to clean all of those so only try on what you like\" which ticked me off and responded with something like \"I'm about to buy a $500 pair of glasses, ill try on as many as i want\" which kinda killed the vibe in the room. I ended up getting a pair of raybans that were $700 in total. Was I a dick? Probably. But its a major pet peve of mine when the buying experience for a luxury product isnt luxury itself.", "YTA. Your mum was right, she was just doing her job and you were very rude to her. You also could have gone back in to apologise but you didn't. I couldn't agree with you more about being pestered when shopping but have a little respect for the someone trying to help.", "YTA. Sorry, but you over-reacted. The sales assistant was doing her job. They can be a bit overbearing and pushy at times, which I personally don't prefer, but that doesn't makes them AH. It's up to you to \\*politely\\* make it clear that you don't need advice/suggestions, just them showing you what \\*you\\* want to try on. Your mom was not helping, next time try to do it without her, or tell her from start that you will handle everything and she shouldn't \"baby\" you.", "YTA. You were unnecessarily rude. Also, there's nothing wrong with being a nerd, grow up.", "ESH\n\nSally because she should have been asking you what styles you like and going sooner frames in those styles. Maybe also suggest a couple other styles that are similar, but that you might not have known about.\n\nYou because you acted like a jerk instead of actually explaining like an adult that you weren't really into those styles and that you'd prefer something more similar you the ones you were looking at.
