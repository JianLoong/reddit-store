I went to the eye doctor a few weeks ago and decided I should get some new glasses since I've had mine a few years.  \n\nWell my mom and I went to get me some glasses yesterday.  I'm still on her insurance and she wanted to help.\n\nWe walked in and right away this sales lady I'll call Sally asked if we needed help. My mom said \"he needs some glasses\" and I said \"yea but I'm just looking \". \n\nSally started picking out different frames and making me try them on.  None of them we're my style,  and whenever I was looking at pairs I LIKED she'd bother me to come try some she picked on. Not sure if she thought my style was different than it actually is or what but she kept picking out nerdy glasses, types that someone would wear to try to look nerdy. So I said I didn't like them or they were too big on my face, or flat out said I looked like a nerd.  My mom just said \"it's her job to be helpful \".\n\nI was getting more annoyed because I'm buying them but can't even look for something I LIKE. Because Sally kept calling me over to try some on.\n\nSo after probably 10 pairs Sally picked. I said \"I'm not really into those they make me look like a geek\". Sally said \"well I think they look cute on your face maybe you'd get used to them\". \n\nI said \"I don't really care what you think. I'm the one that's buying them and has to wear them.  I don't like those styles\". \n\nThen I told my mom I was leaving and walked outside. \n\nMy mom said I was unnecessarily rude and acted childish.  That the sales lady was just doing her job and trying to help and I acted really immature. She wanted me to go back inside but I refused.  \n\nLast time I got glasses the sales person asked if I needed help, I said no that I was looking,  so they let me look and I told them when I found some I liked. \n\nI don't like being harassed when I'm shopping in general, especially with things that affect my appearance.   I don't really thinks it's that bad to tell a stranger that their opinions don't matter but my mom said it's rude. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671811004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztk9pf/aita_for_telling_a_sales_lady_i_dont_care_about/", "score": 252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At 20 you're still young, but old enough to know that establishing boundaries with people doesn't mean being rude and offensive toward them.

A simple \"thanks but I just don't like this style and prefer this other kind of frames, can you show me more in this style, or otherwise I'll just pick some myself and call you when I'm ready to check out\" would've sufficed.
