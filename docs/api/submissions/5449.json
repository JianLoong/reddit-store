I went to the eye doctor a few weeks ago and decided I should get some new glasses since I've had mine a few years.  \n\nWell my mom and I went to get me some glasses yesterday.  I'm still on her insurance and she wanted to help.\n\nWe walked in and right away this sales lady I'll call Sally asked if we needed help. My mom said \"he needs some glasses\" and I said \"yea but I'm just looking \". \n\nSally started picking out different frames and making me try them on.  None of them we're my style,  and whenever I was looking at pairs I LIKED she'd bother me to come try some she picked on. Not sure if she thought my style was different than it actually is or what but she kept picking out nerdy glasses, types that someone would wear to try to look nerdy. So I said I didn't like them or they were too big on my face, or flat out said I looked like a nerd.  My mom just said \"it's her job to be helpful \".\n\nI was getting more annoyed because I'm buying them but can't even look for something I LIKE. Because Sally kept calling me over to try some on.\n\nSo after probably 10 pairs Sally picked. I said \"I'm not really into those they make me look like a geek\". Sally said \"well I think they look cute on your face maybe you'd get used to them\". \n\nI said \"I don't really care what you think. I'm the one that's buying them and has to wear them.  I don't like those styles\". \n\nThen I told my mom I was leaving and walked outside. \n\nMy mom said I was unnecessarily rude and acted childish.  That the sales lady was just doing her job and trying to help and I acted really immature. She wanted me to go back inside but I refused.  \n\nLast time I got glasses the sales person asked if I needed help, I said no that I was looking,  so they let me look and I told them when I found some I liked. \n\nI don't like being harassed when I'm shopping in general, especially with things that affect my appearance.   I don't really thinks it's that bad to tell a stranger that their opinions don't matter but my mom said it's rude. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671811004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztk9pf/aita_for_telling_a_sales_lady_i_dont_care_about/", "score": 1873, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At 20 you're still young, but old enough to know that establishing boundaries with people doesn't mean being rude and offensive toward them.

The glasses she prefers to wear aren't super flattering on her, but she's the one that has to be happy with them, not anyone else.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the \"geeky\" glasses look better on you, if you're not comfortable wearing them, you shouldn't buy them. \n\nI will say, making fun of \"looking nerdy\" isn't really a good look either. It's almost 2023.", "NTA. She lost a sale by being too pushy. She should have offered assistance, and when you declined she should have given you her name and stood back.", "NTA I loathe pushy salespeople. If I ever feel any kind of pressure to buy something I don\u2019t want, I leave.", "NTA. I hate pushy salespeople who think they no better than you after you repeatedly tell them you are not interested. I\u2019m an adult and would have no qualms saying the exact same thing.", "NTA.  You lasted longer than I would have.", "I worked retail as a younger man and this isn't how to do it, but you over-reacted too. What's really stupid is how you didn't spot that she was probably into you.", "op=nta\n\nsales persons need to listen", "My optician had a lady working there (unfortunately, she's just retired) who'd tell me what frames I liked. She was always right. One time, she was off work the day I came in, but she'd picked out some frames for me. I always looked around and thought about things, and tried a few different ones, but I almost always went with the ones she'd picked for me.\n\nThat's how sales should work. She knew my tastes (we'd discussed them) and was wonderfully opinionated without ever being at all pushy.\n\nSally is just not very good at her job, to be honest. NTA.", "I'll say YTA actually. Yes sales folks are annoying, but every encounter can be avoided by saying to them at the start that you don't need their help. You didn't say that. You said you were looking. \n\nLady was doing her job, you were unnecessarily rude.\n\nYta.", "Nta", "NTA  I hate when they do that.", "Nta.", "I agree there may have been some incentive or commission tied to those particular frames. She also may have been trying to assist by choosing something she deems \u201ctrendy\u201d. As a sales person though, she should have been able to read the room better because her absence of awareness in that situation lost her a sale. Seems like she may have also been assisting more if your mom was into it, especially if she was assuming your mom would pay (despite her just being there for opinion/insurance).", "YTA while it does sound like that lady was being annoying, she was just doing her job. I think it would\u2019ve been better to politely tell her that you want to look for glasses yourself", "nta. you definitely could have been kinder, but you seemed to have made it clear you didnt want help.", "Oh my god NTA this happened to me at the eye doctor too. I wasn't even planning on buying frames there (they overcharge SO BAD), but I tried some on just to see what they looked like.\n\nI told the sales lady I didn't like rimless glasses and I liked larger frames. All she showed me were the smallest rimless glasses possible.\n\nDidn't buy any.", "YTA. Formerly worked retail/food service. Sometimes salespeople are required to promote certain products for a period of time. As such that may be why she was promoting those particular frames. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a poster sale it could\u2019ve been her boss told her to sell more of x frames for some reason. Another thing is she could be inexperienced. Usually if someone says they don\u2019t want something you back off but sometimes they don\u2019t because they receive instructions from up above to keep pushing to sell them or they just can\u2019t read social cues. I\u2019ve had this happen many times when going to stores and the cashier is required to promote the company\u2019s credit card. You didn\u2019t need to be rude to her and yes. You did act like a child and directed your anger at someone just trying to do her job. You don\u2019t know what instructions she received and you don\u2019t know her experience level. She may have wanted to go get you the style you wanted but couldn\u2019t because of needing to sell certain frames. I hope this opens your eyes a tiny bit to see that there\u2019s probably a lot you\u2019re missing here information wise.", "I think she liked you honestly. NTA", "NTA... But there is always a kind way to say things. 'Sorry, I'll tell you when I find something I like', it's a phrase i usually use. I even ask their names so when I'm ready to buy i look for the salesman or saleswoman that first approched me.", "NTA but you\u2019re also a bit of a loser to react that way. You\u2019re 20. Grow up. If \u201cSally\u201d was trying hard to get you glasses that suit you she probably thought you had terrible fashion sense and was pointing out what was trendy and wanted to save you from yourself. Not her place but I get it. Sometimes I see people pick out their first pair of glasses and cringe cause they try so hard to find glasses that don\u2019t stand out and end up looking like they have no taste in fashion.", "NTA. Never happened to me before, and I\u2019ve worn glasses for 37 years. The sales associate is supposed to listen to you!! It\u2019s ok to suggest, but she wasn\u2019t listening to what you wanted, and therefore was supremely UNhelpful.", "NTA. When my daughter and I go to the eye doctor, they give us a small bin to put the styles we want to try on it. Then they let us browse. Once we pick a pair, they take the bin to clean the frames.", "I despise pushy salespeople. If I say I'm just looking, or don't need any help, leave me the hell alone. You have made yourself known to me, if I have a question, I'll come find you. On the opposite side are the salespeople who just stand around doing absolutely nothing. The ones who outright ignore me, even when I try to get their help, usually end up looking at my ass as I exit the store empty-handed.", "I don't see any reason for rudeness here.  YTA", "NTA", "NTA. You could have expressed your feelings a bit more gently, but I understand your frustration and anger. It sounds like the sales person was extremely pushy and not paying attention to or considering the customer\u2019s opinion and wishes. Leaving was a good choice, and you might want to share your experience with the owners or managers so they can prevent it from happening to others.", "YTA but it's a difficult call. Sally was annoying in her sales approach. Yet you too were wrong for your retort about not caring about what she thinks. Two wrongs don't make a right. Just remember in future that if you don't like a level of service, feel free to LEAVE, no explanation required. If Sally loses enough customers, she will take the hint. What you need is an eyeglass shop more to your style of shopping, and there are plenty to choose from.", "Kind of TA: I Think that you could have gone about this a different way. I honestly think that you storming off like you did as you explained was a little childish, but a also agree with you that Sally was not really getting the hint that you did not like what she picked out for you,  and was not helpful at all. you could have told her directly and respectfully and say to her \" I appreciate your help, but i want to look for a pair on my own.\" Or something like that instead of storming off, its just a pair a glasses it's not the end of the word. they are there to do a job i get it, it can be a little annoying when they are trying to sell you something that you do not want. that is only part of the job tough. just say \" No thank you.\" and move on.", "NTA. As the saying goes \u201cthe customer is always right in matters of taste.\u201d This salesperson would do well to remember that, they were essentially telling you that your opinion was wrong. You were right to walk away.", "YTA. Your Mom is right.", "Lord help that woman's child / partner.", "so.. your a hypocrite then? nice. OP your NTA", "Yeah fuck that noise. You can wear whatever you want.", "If you like it, and your prescription works in it, it is suitable for your face.", "They don't look good on OP if OP doesn't like the way they look.", "NTA, but in her defense, maybe she has experience with what glasses look best on which face shapes and was genuinely trying to nudge you towards frames that are most flattering for you. \n\nI think aviator sunglasses look cool and certain people wear them to try to look cool but if I wear them I look like a major dork. The glasses you think \u201cpeople would wear to try and look nerdy\u201d might not have given others the same impression if you see the one wearing them. Maybe on you they look cool and you were unable to eee it because you were too fixated on your perception of the glasses as nerdy. If that were the case, maybe that\u2019s what she means by \u201cyou\u2019ll get used to them\u201d. You\u2019ll take a second look without any prejudice and say \u201cHmm, surprisingly, these do look really good on me.\u201d", "Sally was already told the style she picks out is the \"nerd look\" which OP doesn't want, yet keeps repeatedly picking out similar as she deems the OP's image, and doubles down with he can get used to it.", "If you ever want to buy in store, take someone with you who can take pictures of you with the frames on.\n\nBut also I would just stick with Zenni personally lol", "From going to different optometrists- some of offices kind of have a policy that the office workers pull glasses for you. Others just let you loose.", "Helping people find glasses involves helping them find glasses they LIKE. She was not doing her job if she was not doing that.", "Lucky you! I had everything from what was considered the best insurance in my state to medicaid, and none have covered the glasses themselves though my visits are only $35 with my current (good) insurance. And glasses stores in my state (at least the 5 different companies I've tried over the years) that take insurance are much more expensive than ordering for yourself because they charge to pull your prescription and to take your measurements on top of hawking designer frames at you.\n\n\nLuckily my optometrist is a pretty cool guy who gives me a print off of my prescription and my pupillary distance after each check up, so I just order my own glasses for $15-$40 online.\n\n\n I'm very curious though, for your insurance to include a pair of glasses with your yearly check up all in one do they have a limited set of approved frame styles and colors that you have to choose from? I couldn't imagine they'd just give you free rein to pick any frame and add-on you wanted.", "This is how it came off to me. It's pretty easy to tell a salesperson what you do want and they'll be accommodating. Especially when it comes to glasses. They generally have a limited inventory and know what they have and where to look. \n\nYou say \"no plastic frames, no thick frames. No square lenses. This is my range of color preferences.\"\n\nGlasses aren't like buying clothes. How good they look on you is highly dependent upon face shape which isn't a factor most people are used to considering. They're generally pretty skilled at picking stuff that looks good on you, even if it's not what you'd usually pick. \n\nHave a list of dos and don'ts that are more specific than \"nerdy\" and they will be helpful.", "Not the point I'm arguing, not surprised many of you are jumping to ignorant conclusions", "my grandparents were farmers and went to a car dealership in their work clothes (this was in the 50s). No one would approach them until the New Guy did. He also tried to sell them a more modest car but Grandpa said, \"no, I want THIS one (pointing to a Cadillac).\" He pulled out a wad of cash and bought the car on the spot.", "That's not at all what i described. Being followed after being greeted and telling them that \"I'm just looking\" or \"no thanks\" is over the top pushy and will actually stop my desire to look around. Especially if they're wearing loud walkie talkies or keep asking questions. \n\ni have walked into empty stores where the staff are gossiping and not working and I might have been looking for something but now i'm offended at whatever they are saying and don't want to patronize the store. \n\nthat's not being Goldilocks, that's choosing where to spend my money.", "I went in knowing exactly what I wanted and the ability to buy it. I wasn\u2019t looking to be sold on anything. I\u2019m pretty sure it was one of the easiest sales the guy I bought it from has ever had."]}
