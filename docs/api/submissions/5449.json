I went to the eye doctor a few weeks ago and decided I should get some new glasses since I've had mine a few years.  \n\nWell my mom and I went to get me some glasses yesterday.  I'm still on her insurance and she wanted to help.\n\nWe walked in and right away this sales lady I'll call Sally asked if we needed help. My mom said \"he needs some glasses\" and I said \"yea but I'm just looking \". \n\nSally started picking out different frames and making me try them on.  None of them we're my style,  and whenever I was looking at pairs I LIKED she'd bother me to come try some she picked on. Not sure if she thought my style was different than it actually is or what but she kept picking out nerdy glasses, types that someone would wear to try to look nerdy. So I said I didn't like them or they were too big on my face, or flat out said I looked like a nerd.  My mom just said \"it's her job to be helpful \".\n\nI was getting more annoyed because I'm buying them but can't even look for something I LIKE. Because Sally kept calling me over to try some on.\n\nSo after probably 10 pairs Sally picked. I said \"I'm not really into those they make me look like a geek\". Sally said \"well I think they look cute on your face maybe you'd get used to them\". \n\nI said \"I don't really care what you think. I'm the one that's buying them and has to wear them.  I don't like those styles\". \n\nThen I told my mom I was leaving and walked outside. \n\nMy mom said I was unnecessarily rude and acted childish.  That the sales lady was just doing her job and trying to help and I acted really immature. She wanted me to go back inside but I refused.  \n\nLast time I got glasses the sales person asked if I needed help, I said no that I was looking,  so they let me look and I told them when I found some I liked. \n\nI don't like being harassed when I'm shopping in general, especially with things that affect my appearance.   I don't really thinks it's that bad to tell a stranger that their opinions don't matter but my mom said it's rude. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671811004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztk9pf/aita_for_telling_a_sales_lady_i_dont_care_about/", "score": 1108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At 20 you're still young, but old enough to know that establishing boundaries with people doesn't mean being rude and offensive toward them.

Instead of saying it like that you could've said ''I want to pick myself I don't need any recommendations, thank you'', no ?", "Yes. You were a rude, immature brat.", "YTA. Learn how to be polite. You can literally say something like, \"hey, thanks, I'm going to look around a bit more by myself.\"\n\nAdditionally, if you don't want your mom's advice, don't have her come with you to the eye doctor and glasses store. As such a mature adult, I'm sure you know that she doesn't need you to be there to use the insurance, right?", "Wow I\u2019m surprised that there\u2019s so many N T A judgements here. I\u2019m going with a light YTA cus of course there\u2019s nothing wrong with telling her to back off, but you said it in a very harsh way. Being with anyone who talks to people like that is mega embarrassing when you could\u2019ve just said \u201cHey, I think I\u2019ll be alright finding a pair for myself, but thank you for the assistance\u201d and went on your merry way. It\u2019s all about how you say this stuff and not being a jerk about it.", "I thought you were kind of an asshole.  All you had to say to her was \" thank you\" and then ignore her.  I don't understand why this had to ruin your whole day.", "YTA. \n\n> Then I told my mom I was leaving and walked outside.\n\nThat\u2019s a weird thing to do. Just keep shopping, and stay with your mum.", "NTA. OP, next time say, \"I appreciate that you're trying to help me, but I'd rather look without help.\"\n\nAlso, I had a sales lady at a store once. I came out to look at myself in this shirt I loved in different lighting, and this lady told me the shirt basically looked awful on me. She ran off and brought these ugly shirts. I tried on a few while she exclaimed how great I looked. I ended up leaving without buying anything because she just wouldn't stop, even though I tried to tell her I didn't need help in about ten different ways.\n\nSometimes sales people just think they know everything.", "Where did you get that from? Perhaps you should read his account again more carefully.", "I agree with this. Everyone is the AH in this situation. Yes. OP is the one who has to wear the glasses and he should be able to browse for a pair that fits his personal style. \n\nMom is an AH\u2026 actually mom is not AH. She reacted in a way that any parent would when their \u201cadult\u201d child embarrassed them in public. If I\u2019m the one paying the bill you better believe that my kid won\u2019t act out in public without getting checked. \n\nSally is an AH because she couldn\u2019t take a hint and let OP look at the selection without being bothered. It\u2019s literally her job to make recommendations. These are generally based on her taste. We\u2019ve established that her taste is nowhere near the same as OP. \n\nAfter reading the post a couple of times. I seriously doubt you were as polite as you describe. People tend to take things for face value without knowing all the facts. The story was told from the perspective of someone that believes that they couldn\u2019t have possibly done anything wrong. Albeit pushy, the optician was just doing their job. \n\nSorry OP. You\u2019re an AH too.", "How? It's not like I dislike other people for choosing that style but it's not my thing.", "No I'm not.", "I'm not getting married or having kids bro.", "Sometimes sales people can't seem to disengage their personal views...  NTA", "Glasses sales people are the worst. They\u2019re always pushing whatever the trend is that year. People have ONE pair of glasses that they wear for years! Who cares about trend?", "Maybe she thought you were cute and is just real crap at flirting? (I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s somewhere close to your age by her comments).\n\nRegardless of her motives NTA- you said you were good and she kept bugging you. You told her you didn\u2019t need help politely several times and she kept at it- she was in the wrong should have let it go.", "I think she was being a nosy, controlling old lady that wants you to look like whatever aesthetic that she personally likes. Which understandably you don\u2019t like. It\u2019s totally normal to tell salespeople to go away. Especially ones like her", "I assumed she was old! Regardless of age, it\u2019s not ok to be pushy like that.", "Nerdy style? \n\nThere\u2019s a chance she knows what\u2019s more current. Next time just lead with \u201cthat\u2019s not my style I need x shape/style\u201d", "You haven\u2019t worked retail have you? At least not a retail job where direct selling is involved. It\u2019s their job to sell, therefore they have to cater to the person with the wallet, otherwise you don\u2019t get the sale", "I accept this. But I'm paying for my own glasses, not my mom.", "A good salesperson listens to their client/customer she disregarded you numerous times NTA I could maybe understand if it was the insurance thing but if you were willing to pay the difference she should\u2019ve listened to you", "Ok. I was trying to figure out why she kept picking out those particular glasses.", "Mine are like that, I can't use rimless styles, but there's a way to say it that isn't pushy. I agree with prudent, she was just bad at her job.", "Lol a lot of people? Trends can last  for years, humans like fashion etc", "That thought crossed my mind and annoyed me more.", "I feel this is a good opener for a sales person. Start by asking what do you like/what\u2019s your style/ ideas about colours/ price range etc. that would be doing her job. What actually happened sounds like harassment", "Or imagine offering that opinion proactively as the customer!", "On his parent's insurance", "Maybe I made my point not clear. I'm not a native speaker, I'm also not great at expressing my thoughts.\n\nWhat I meant is that his mom is treating him like he's some small kid who needs a lot of guidance. This is what moms do - until you show them that you're all grown up and that you don't need this from them anymore. Some moms get this message right away, others need years of persuasion (worst case they accept this...), either way he is the person who needs to tell his mom that while he is grateful for her for taking care of him all these years, from now on he can make his own decisions (in this case, can choose his own style of glasses, and doesn't want her or the salesperson's style advice).", "Yeah, its their job to be pushy and obnoxious. My mom doesn't need a 2500$ laptop for her facebook browsing but I still had to swear at the Best Buy guy for him to understand that. Just because their manager wants them to be unbearable doesn't mean clients have to put up with it and accept the upselling.", "Not on your mother\u2019s insurance which would cover the bulk of the cost? Regardless, the situation could\u2019ve been handled better by all parties involved. Merry Christmas OP. I hope Santa brings you the gift of good vision.", "congratulations you figured out what insurance is! you must feel so smart adding nothing to the conversation", "So in other words, you yelled at someone for doing their job properly, which they\u2019re pressured into doing? You can be firm without needing to yell or be cruel. It startles me how little human empathy people like you have\u2026", ">The minute your mom started speaking, and telling Sally what you needed.\n\nHow does this crappy bot get any upvotes at all? This comment makes zero sense, because it is an excerpt from someone else\u2019s sentence.", "Helping people find glasses they actually WANT is her job- treating random customers like her own personal styler doll not so\nMuch.\n\nI think op was her type and those glasses made him more her type and she was so busy trying to build her boyfriend she totally missed the mark.\n\nNTA- you told her no, she ignored you, you told her again- she ignored you and told you you could get used to the style she picked out.\n\nThis is just bizarre. Like I can see a girlfriend pulling this but some total stranger?\n\nYeah weird.\n\nNTA", "At some point, its not helping anymore.

I\u2019ll come back later or maybe go to your competitor. \n\nThat said, I think it\u2019s also reasonable to politely ask her to stop helping you and if that doesn\u2019t work, to escalate to a manager and explain that she\u2019s being extremely overbearing.

She may care more about what her manner thinks than you", "It's so uncomfortable. \n\nI hate shopping for cars, beds & furniture.", "I have a few pairs of glasses all a different shade of purple, I bloody love them"]}
