That's just gross. He should be wearing diapers to bed if he's not yet able to wake up to go. Someday he will grow out of this but not yet. \n\nAlso putting them in there also is a big invasion of privacy.  I don't get it.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI'm not a doctor or professional, but your nephew is 13 years old and still wets the bed? That needs to be checked out ASAP.\n\nYou shouldn't have to have someone sleep in your bed and wet it too. And he shouldn't have sleepovers if he continues to be a bedwetter.", "NTA.  Your mother has issues", "NTA. Why isn't he wearing Pull Ups? There are incontinence products out there for all ages. Your mom needs to buy a new mattress protector anyway, so saying the one on his bed is ripped is just an excuse. Does the friend know about the nephew's bed wetting, and is your mom hoping that just because a friend sleeps over, that will be enough to stop the bed wetting for that night?? You're not home, so you can't prevent your mom from doing what she wants, but you aren't wrong to not want him to sleep in your bed!", "Even solely going by the post\u2018s title, NTA. Your mom might be the home owner AND have bought that bed, but it\u2019s 100% reasonable to not want someone peeing where you sleep.", "NTA, Why can\u2019t your mom buy another waterproof cover before the sleepover? Your mom is the AH for pulling the \u201cit\u2019s her house\u201d card. Nobody wants to sleep on a bed they know someone else has peed in.", "NTA, you should be to decide who sleeps in your bed--enuresis or not.", "NTA but i\u2019d seriously do my best to get out of there and it\u2019s rather unhealthy for a 13 y.o. to regularly be wetting the bed", "NTA. She has given you this space for the time being. While it is her room, your belongings are in it and the space is clearly set aside for your private use, so putting the boys in there would lead to the problems you listed.", "NTA, no one wants their bed to smell like piss. Sounds like she\u2019s holding the living situation over your head.", "NTA but yikes the mum", "NTA, and to be honest, I'm not sure what your mom is thinking... you have one room in her house, so ***all*** personal items are there (including meds per your post).  You are an adult, which means there are **definitely** adult things in your room (or at the very least, things that aren't *technically* adult but are either not suitable for thirteen-year-old boys or something you wouldn't want them to get their hands on).\n\nMy cousin (well, technically, my cousin's wife but I see her as a counsin) told me a story about her eleven-year-old nephew and his friend staying overnight in her room for a sleepover (she was away at college at the time). Her bedroom at her parent's place had a connected bathroom, which is why they opted for her room. Anyway, the next day, her parents and her aunt/uncle kept finding clean yet stringless tampons all over the house. Apparently, the two boys had found the box in her bathroom and decided they were good standins for granades. So they each took half the box and a pair of scissors and spent the night trying to blow each other up. You know, with tampon granades.\n\nAnd while it was perfectly harmless in that the kids weren't exposed to any horrible adult stuff, it ended up being a very expesinve game, given they used up nearly the whole box, which was one of those multi-size/bulk boxes that cost like $30+.\n\nYour mom didn't ask you to set your room up so your nephew could spend the night in the room before you left, which means you didn't have time to stow/hide/lock up stuff that nobody wants a 13-year-old boy to get into, including your medications.\n\nSo, even if there was **no** possibility of getting urine on your mattress, I would still say NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Boundaries are good. Your mom is being an AH.", "NTA. It looks like you have some boundary setting to do.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s your space, if he wets the bed he shouldn\u2019t be having friends over.", "NTA", "NTA not only are there sensitive, private objects in your room that a pair of young teen boys shouldn't have access to, but someone's bed, above all other places, should be THEIRS! its it's perhaps the most personal space a person has! Your mom has PROBLEMS!!!", "NTA, at that age if he has a bedwetting problem he should be wearing some sort of adult diaper and OP's mom needs to invest in an air mattress for sleepovers.", "NTA I don\u2019t want no pissy baby in my bed either. Get a lock for your room.", "NTA I don't understand your mom's lack of logic at all. His mattress protector is ripped, so the solution is for him to stain another mattress?", "NTA. His water proof cover is ripped, so instead of peeing HIS bed it's better that he sleeps/pees in yours? Ewww.", "Look up the statistics on older male children who wet beds and abuse. It\u2019s alarming.\n\nGo home and protect your room.\n\nNTA\n\nSomething is going on in that home. Your Mom is deliberately violating your privacy and your nephew is in danger of neglect or abuse.", "Info : what's your age?\n\nWhat steps are you take to have your own place outside the influence of your mother?", "ESH-ish.\n\nI would be upset too, but... it's not your room, nor mattress. Totally understandable how you wouldn't want to sleep in a urine-tainted bed or sheets, but you also don't seem like you can afford to be a choosy beggar at the moment.\n\nOverall, a piss-poor situation to be caught in.", "As someone who wet off and on until adulthood (basically due to a traumatic childhood)--just have him sleep on a towel on the bed, this really isn't a big deal. I think your mom is technically in the right here because it's her house and her say, but I empathize with not wanting it.\n\nAnyway a towel will protect the mattress.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Feel bad for the kid, however, nooooo.", "Ok Kevin lol", "You need to go home and purchase a waterproof mattress cover immediately and your nephew needs to see a specialist.  He would benefit from some type of adult pull up. They also make an alarm pad so he would wake up when he wets the bed.", "There\u2019s a reason he still wets to bed and should be seeing a dr or therapist.", "Bedwetter isn\u2019t something a child can control, and it\u2019s wrong to shame them or deny them normal social activities for their age - like sleepovers because of it. But they should be wearing nighttime diapers or check with their pediatrician for medication that prevents nighttime urination. It\u2019s not for everyday long term use but for situations like this where a child wants to have sleepovers with their friends. My son is 12 and still west the bed, we\u2019ve done extensive testing but some kids just take longer to produce enough of the hormone needed.", "Yes and the issue is her adult daughter still is dependent on her.", "Tbh, They make amazing, cushy, silent waterproof covers now. Long gone are the days of laying on a wrinkly plastic mattress cover that reminds you constantly whenever you move that you have bedwetting issues.  I sometimes have issues with incontinence at night due to PTSD related night terrors, and I know my mom and sister use them because of their elderly dogs and cats who may lose their control while sleeping too. It is way too infrequent for me to use adult diapers, and the mattress pad is absolutely ace and super cpmfortable. There really is no reason not to own one at least for yourself even if you don't have elderly animals or foreseeable incontinence issues. Heck, it makes it so you don't get your mattress wet too if you drop a glass of water on it accidentally from your nightstand. They are even useful for people who sweat heavily in their sleep to keep from staining and ruining their mattresses. It should not be treated as a stigma to own or use one, op should talk to her mom about one.", "Really?", "I think the other child waking up in a pee-soaked bed (both children are in that room together) or noticing that the nephew wears a diaper to bed would result in far more shame than simply not having a sleepover.", "Yeah, I\u2019ve known more than one person who wet the bed until about 13.
