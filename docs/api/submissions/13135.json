Her bedroom at her parent's place had a connected bathroom, which is why they opted for her room. Anyway, the next day, her parents and her aunt/uncle kept finding clean yet stringless tampons all over the house. Apparently, the two boys had found the box in her bathroom and decided they were good standins for granades. So they each took half the box and a pair of scissors and spent the night trying to blow each other up. You know, with tampon granades.\n\nAnd while it was perfectly harmless in that the kids weren't exposed to any horrible adult stuff, it ended up being a very expesinve game, given they used up nearly the whole box, which was one of those multi-size/bulk boxes that cost like $30+.\n\nYour mom didn't ask you to set your room up so your nephew could spend the night in the room before you left, which means you didn't have time to stow/hide/lock up stuff that nobody wants a 13-year-old boy to get into, including your medications.\n\nSo, even if there was **no** possibility of getting urine on your mattress, I would still say NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.
