People with young children usually do attend fewer events held by the larger family for the reasons you describe.  Parents want to see their kids open gifts in their own home.  \n\nThe problem is not your in-laws though, it's your husband.  Your in-laws are going to want to have things their way and it is your husband's job (he is the blood relative) to communicate what you and he will do after first discussing it with you.\n\nIf he is making decisions without discussing them with you, then you have a problem in your relationship.  You need to agree as a team on what's reasonable.  \n\nI wouldn't be going to al of the events you listed either.  Maybe visit his grandmother at some point during the day.  His parents can visit you there or at your house if their children have all left the nest.  That's pretty standard.  If they can't get to you because of other obligations, then visit them on Christmas Eve or the day after Christmas.  You may agree on a different schedule with your husband, of course, after negotiating.", "NTA. All of that sounds excessive and exhausting.\n\nAfter we had our first baby, we stayed home for holidays for a while. I\u2019d welcome people to our home, but we weren\u2019t going to travel, deal with nap scheduling issues and lug all the baby gear everywhere. Just no.\n\nNow that our kids are older, it\u2019s much easier, and we take turns hosting and going to other family member\u2019s homes for holidays.\n\nWhile baby is little, if you want to stay home, you should.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s more of a husband problem. Your husband should put his immediate family (you and child) first. Your concerns are reasonable and valid. And the fact that his immediate reaction was to accuse you of disliking his family was disproportionate. 3-4 gatherings per holiday seems exhausting and excessive especially when you have a newborn. Husband shown his true colors on who\u2019s feelings takes priority.", "NTA \n\nTruthfully that sounds miserable.  Do your own thing at home, or go to one event. If he wants to go to more, then he can go alone.", "NTA - I was once you.  It gets old after a while.  You can always not go and blame the vid.", "NTA\u2026 But it is normal. Not normal for everyone but normal for a lot of people. Especially with family that close. Your husband needs to stop with the \u201cyou hate my family business\u201d and support you but you need to realize that he probably enjoys the traditions of his family gatherings. You both need to compromise. You say extended family should take a backseat but you need to be on the same page of what\u2019s best for your little family. He might feel that the holidays are about being with extended family and that\u2019s what\u2019s best. It\u2019s pretty normal to stop going to some of the family events. Maybe you no longer attend the aunts events but always grandmas or whatever one the most family is at. Maybe you do every other year. You\u2019ll just have to figure it out. Whatever you decide, get on the same page and don\u2019t let him make it your decision when he speaks to his family.", "NTA\n\nIf his family wants to see more of the baby, then they can make plans with you to visit instead of making you come to them every single time.\n\nOtherwise, that's an awful lot of get-togethers every holiday season. I had a pretty good family, and typically there were only 2-3 big holiday get-togethers each *year,* and all the rest were just for close family and not the whole clan.\n\nI really don't blame you for wanting a break to just have a holiday season for yourselves.", "NTA. \n\nI am in a similar boat, 2 young children and my parents divorced and dad remarried. That makes every holiday: wife\u2019s parents, my mother, my fathers side, my stepmothers side. We had to have a conversation with them finally that it was too much for us to do every single one. There were some hurt feelings for sure. \n\nWe do what we can to combine my mom with my in laws, and make sure if we didn\u2019t go to the previous holiday with one of those groups, we definitely make it to the next one. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting and I hope you guys are able to work it out with his family. My suggestion is to try to come to some middle ground.", "NTA. NOW is the time to stand your ground. Set your boundaries. Start YOUR own traditions. You and your lovely little family will be spending holidays at home. If anyone would like to spend time with you, let them know the window of time when you will be accepting guests.

I grew up in a gigantic family and there was one Thanksgiving, and the larger family got together on Xmas Eve, and Xmas Day was with your nuclear family and the grandparents came by.

Invite the family to your house for Christmas dinner. Resist all efforts to \"help\" or \"make things easier.\" Insist that if they will not come to you for baby's first Christmas, they must not love you or the baby.\n\nThen once Christmas day itself is situated, make some personal traditions for your own little family. Christmas tree farm? Cookie baking? Visit to Santa (which be warned may be a total nightmare)? Pick what you want to do and make plans. Feel free to invite the family to join you.

And I said, no thanks, lol.\n\nDifferent strokes for different folks", "NTA.  Why does everything have to be an all or nothing situation? Come up with a list of holiday events you'll all attend as a family, ones you want on your own, some where you host others (if you want to that is) and if some he can take your little one to on his own.  \n\nHmmm, maybe try that first, he'll quickly realize how much more exhausting it is doing these events solo.\n\nIf he tries to pull the you hate his family, tell him you don't appreciate being guilted or made to feel wrong for wanting to build memories with just the 3 of you, or like a bad in law because it's exhausting for both you and baby to constantly be in hyperfocus mode due to the lack of baby proofing.  \n\nGood luck!", "NTA-raising kids is exhausting and there are many events that I simply do not want to go to because it creates more work for me.

As such, I can see how this could be a delicate situation for everyone involved.   I\u2019m not a very direct person and know how delicate family relations are.

Big hugs!!", "My late husband and I had a blended family with 2 of our own.   Neither of our exes was reliable.   Going to his family Christmas/Thanksgiving resulted in kids being dropped off to an empty house.   We decided to focus on OUR unit and see other families the weekend before\u2026.making it clear that they were all welcome at our place\u2026.Christmas\u2026.nope.\u2026we had to go to our inlaws or my janky ass SIL and BIL\u2026.the anointed ones who are now divorced\u2026.or nothing\u2026.it was nothing and we all loved happily ever after\u2026.NTAH", "NTA. Time to carve out some space and time for your family. You don\u2019t have to attend anyone else\u2019s parties.", "NTA start your own traditions and decide what events you\u2019ll go to and flip flop next year. Good way to do it is have Christmas am just the three of you. Then choose to go to whatever works for you both or rather three of you.", "NTA.  Go to the one thrown by his mom and skip the others.", "NAH - some people love going to all the gatherings and others like to do their own celebration with their immediate family and then everything in between.\n\nIt sounds like the 2 of you just need to talk things through ahead of time, make a plan for how many events you want to go to and then remind your husband not to start saying yes when invited. Talk about making some of your own personal traditions.", "NTA. \n\nWe used covid to break away from old traditions set by dead relatives. Me and my husband are from massive families and we just wanted a small quiet Christmas with just our kids. It\u2019s been great. It\u2019s a chance to create our own family traditions.\n\nMake sure it\u2019s your husband who tells this to his parents. He handles his family, you handle yours. Otherwise if you say something, your mil is going to harp that you\u2019re anti family.", "NTA, this may be \"normal\" for them but normal is subjective here. You say it's to much its to much. If they really wanted to see the baby it wouldn't only be at times and locations that are convenient for them. Start placing boundaries and let your husband k ow he needs to grow a spine quick when it comes to his family of origin because he has a new family now that needs to come 1st. Spend those holidays just the 3 of you and make great memories (and take lots of pictures kids grow to quick!) if you're feeling generous you can facetime them.", "You're definitely NTA.\n\nAs a kid, I had divorced parents who both remarried. Christmas was a nightmare, dad house with step mom, dads parents, step moms parents, moms house with stepdad, moms family, and step-dad family. \n\nWe had no time to be kids and play with our new toys. \n\nOnce I had kids, I made them come to me because I was not gonna drag my kids all over hell and back when I knew all they wanna do is enjoy their loot.", "NTA - No this is not normal, families usually do 0-2 events per holiday season (1 house hosts Thanksgiving, one or a few houses host a Christmas event, and then small things like \"gingerbread decorating party\" or \"Adult only Christmas party\" are case by case basis), 1 larger party per milestone birthday/anniversary, and then youngs gets usually get their own family parties for the first couple of years. 3-4 events PER holiday/birthday is absolutely insane.", "NTA  \nAnd here's the thing. You don't have to do \"normal\" or \"what other families do.\" You do what you want to do, and what you're comfortable with. You and your husband decide what your priority event or events are and stand by them. And decide which family events you enjoy and want to participate in.\n\nWhen asked, keep your responses polite and matter-of-fact. \"Thanks so much for inviting us, but we're really looking forward to Christmas Eve / Christmas morning / Whatever day with just the three of us, to start forming our own traditions.\" Repeat as necessary.\n\nI would not bring up the fact that travel is an issue, or they might very well suggest coming to your house.", "This. My husband let his mom run all over me our first Christmas; she lied about the times so we would be where she wanted us when she wanted. On our way home I told him, That won't ever happen again, and it didn't. I told HER when we would be there (one of the three events she expected us to attend Xmas and Xmas Eve) and stuck to it. Go to what you'll enjoy, let your husband go alone if there are get togethers he looks forward to. Set your own family's holiday schedule, and work around that. Good luck!", "Agree. I tried that traveling around with babies/kids on the holidays and it's the worst. Let them know they are welcome to join you  (if that's true) but you will be staying home.", "I was definitely not super clear - normally he agrees it\u2019s a lot but just agrees to go because his mother is pretty insistent. This is our first year with a child (the three of us were home for the holidays last year as we were all horribly sick!) I wasn\u2019t being very nice about it one day and he said, \u201cIt seems like you just hate them.\u201d He wants to see them, but not as often. I\u2019d rather never go. So we will definitely compromise and just attend the ones we WANT to go too! I would not stay married to a man who had no spine, I pinky promise! It\u2019s my fault for not being more clear. :)", "Right, holidays with family is normal. Holidays with each family member individually is wacko.", "Definitely not opting out fully! I want my daughter to have a big family she has access to for sure! Maybe not five times a holiday though lol!", "Oh, I 100% won\u2019t subject my daughter to only time with us! I was an only child and was bored with just mom and dad sometimes. Just while she\u2019s an infant primarily! And then reducing the amount we go up there overall would be ideal.", "Definitely not interested in fully eliminating spending time with them nor avoiding them on holidays fully! Currently they just have too many events to allow us to do anything at home ourselves so I\u2019d like to cut back! It just is hard to pick what to cut back because each family member throws a different party at a different place for the same occasion. It also doesn\u2019t leave us time to visit my father because they\u2019re often on the same day at the same time. So it\u2019s a lot!", "They\u2019re a family of teen parents so they have GENERATIONS more alive and young than most families. My daughter is lucky to have a grandma, two great grandmas, and two great great grandmas. It\u2019s so beautiful but SO MUCH SOCIALIZING.", "They don\u2019t travel because they choose not to. The older family members that aren\u2019t safe to drive I\u2019m fine visiting 100% of the time because I understand the situation. Everyone else is super close together because they grew up there and never moved. Husband works in city A (where his family lives) and I work in city C so we split the difference and moved to city B. It was the fairest choice for us to each drive the same amount for work without overextending either of us!", "Your husband probably need a reminder that going to family parties for holidays is not normal for you. That you understand it is normal for him however it is more exhausting for you for its not something you grew up with.", "Honestly my best childhood memories are the holidays with the whole family\u2026 just because you didn\u2019t have a family that close doesn\u2019t mean is bad cause you are not use to it", "Your husband has a big family! Certainly making a space for one more (your father) could be accommodated. In my experience people who love an excuse to gather (like 4 different parties for the same event) also are \u201cthe more the merrier\u201d crowd. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t agree with your reasoning or excuses. Are you saying that literally every single Saturday and Sunday all year there is some family party you are invited to?", "You say there are four occasions? Can you just pick two for this year?", "If my father would come, it would absolutely be easier yes! He is remarried now and lives with his MIL who has some health issues so they try to stay home for holidays and just host. They\u2019ve come to one event (my baby shower) but nothing else. They were invited though!\n\nEvery single weekend (unless they have work or a school event for a kid) they get together for something on at least his mom\u2019s side, yes! They\u2019re very close and live very very close so it\u2019s easier for them then it is for us. Holiday months like December or November there is something every Friday or weekend.", "My husband and I discussed picking one for his moms side and then one for his dads side so it\u2019s as fair as possible!", "I feel for you in this position, but I hope you see the big picture here. \n\nYour side of the family is small and finds any reason to stay home. Your an only child, and your one surviving remarried parent / step mom don\u2019t leave their house. You are trying to do the same. \n\nYour husband is from a large family that spends every weekend getting together with one another. \n\nYou might want to think of how you want your child to turn out: close with all the cousins, aunts, uncles, grands, great grands etc, always a support network vs we just look at the 3 of ourselves all the time. There isn\u2019t a right or wrong here, but your decisions and reluctance to do one will result in the other occurring.", "I appreciate your perspective! My daughter is number one and I\u2019ll do whatever my husband and I agree to be in her best interest. It\u2019ll most likely have to be a happy medium - attending some, but not all, until she\u2019s old enough to tell us what she wants to do! Thank you for your input.", "You are welcome! TBH I was an only child. Only saw other family on major holidays. My first serious adult relationship was a person with a HUGE family. And having grown up only staring at the same 3 people All. The. Time. Except twice a year when it was 7 people really sucked in comparison to being welcome into the opportunity to be around 30+ people on any given weekend that were always so happy to see everyone and actually cared what each other were up to. I was more sad to miss that persons family when we split than anything else, because I wished so much growing up to have this built in permanent network of people that would always be there for each other."]}
