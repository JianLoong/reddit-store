She has been pretty rebelious since she was young and has always had a nasty attitude towards me, and so, I haven't always been the nicest to her.\n\nShe absolutely never listens to me and always says that I am not her second mom, and that she doesn't have three parents, which I agree with. Except that she uses it when its not necessary, like when I'm trying to tell her to do things so that my dad doesn't loose his temper when he gets home.\n\nI fight with her the most though over cleaning the kitchen and her taking my stuff. She has started telling me what I will and will not do, which is unacceptable in my opinion. I am not allowed into her bedroom, even if she goes into mine, and I have to clean the kitchen, even if my mother has asked her to do so.\n\nI have begged and pleaded that she stop's taking my stuff but she says that if I don't use it, than she can. Whether it's my makeup or clothing or even my art equipment, she takes it and fights if I try and take it back. She raises her voice so quickly, without me even doing anything, just to get me in trouble.\n\nI found my expensive art equipment in her bedroom the a while back and brought it up in a civil way, but I was told to just leave it because it doesn't matter. I feel so frustrated.\n\nI have started trying to ask my mom for help with these fights, and she will try and stop my sister sometimes, but most of the time I just get fought with and it hurts so much, as if nothing I do matters.\n\nI overheard some insults on instagtam the other day, and my sister and I were fighting that same evening in the kitchen about her not doing what my mom asked her to do. She escalated the situation by deciding to fat shame me, something she does often. I am not what I would consider fat, but I am insecure about my weight, and she is super skinny.\n\nI decided that I had had enough and decided to use an insult I had come accross. I said to her, \"You know what sister's name, there is a tree somewhere out there in the world. This tree's sole purpose in it's life is to replace the oxygen that you waste, go find your tree and apologize to it.\"\n\nIt ended the argument really quickly and I won't lie, I was pretty happy with myself. My parents said that what I said made me am Asshole. It didn't seem to bother her much because she is unphased by everything, but I feel like it might have been crossing a line.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: I live in South Africa and most people my age still live at home.

Full grown woman fighting with a child lol, selfish child, weak parents, abusive dad causing stress on the whole family \n\nGet a lock. If you can't, get a safe.", "NTA for the comment, that was actually kind of funny and if someone told me that during I fight I would probably start laughing. Buuut I think you should really stop and take a look at the dynamics within your relationship and your family. If living at home at 23 WORKS for you, that\u2019s great but it doesn\u2019t sound like the best environment at this time. You\u2019re fighting with your sister, tiptoeing around your dad, and your mom isn\u2019t providing much support. If you have the means, or could have the means, I would consider thinking about whether some space would be good for you, and probably them. \n\nThe thing that irks me a bit is that your sister is 15, still developmentally a kid in so, so many ways. You are an adult taking the bait from a teenager. I was a bit younger, but I had literally the same dynamic with my own little sister up until I was about 16 and she was 9/10\u2013she would steal my stuff, yell and scream when she didn\u2019t get her way or had to do a single chore, say horribly mean things to me because she knew what I was insecure about and I, too was responsible for her for much of her life up until that point, she still jokingly calls me mom but neither of us found it funny at the time when I basically was helping raise her. So when I was 16 I had some serious health problems that forced me to move away and live with our dad and almost immediately we stopped hating each other because we were able to just be sisters which allowed her to see that I was really unwell and just needed my family to be kind and gentle with me and I was able to see that she was just a child with no say in anything and her feistiness is largely a defense. \n\nObviously your situation is different but the sentiment, I think, remains the same. You and your sister need to get out of this dynamic you have whether mentally, physically, or both and see each other for the beautifully flawed humans that you both are. You probably have a lot more in common than you realize and if you can put your egos aside (this can start with just you btw), I think a lot of healing could happen because you were both thrust into familial roles you had no choice in but those things change over time and if you\u2019re able and willing to see that, a LOT of good can from that.\n\nEdits: spacing, typos/grammar", "NTA.

Perhaps you can find your sister in a good mood and just talk candidly about what it\u2019s been like for you to have the pressure of all the responsibilities you carry as well as how it makes you feel when she takes your things or says hurtful things but be empathetic and willing to hear what she has to say and feels\u2014also try to put yourself in her shoes, you were 15 not too, too long ago and even under the best circumstances being a teenager is no walk in the park. I doubt she wants to fight with you all the time either but if that\u2019s the dynamic, it can be hard to break out of over night but she\u2019s old enough to understand that her words and actions have consequences that she will likely regret later if she can\u2019t see the impact right now. \n\nMy little sister and I are now extremely close and she\u2019s truly my best friend despite the age gap and it kills me when I see siblings who don\u2019t have that because it IS possible and so beautiful, it just takes a little work. \ud83d\udc9c\n\nETA in no way am I saying that it\u2019s okay for her to be taking your stuff or saying hurtful things, she definitely needs to hear from you how much it affects and bothers you.

I mean, I still love her and watch out for her because I WANT to and I try and help her communicate with my parents and deal with her emotions because I\u2019ve had to figure stuff like that out on my own and that\u2019s the real benefit to being an older sibling if you\u2019re not being forced to be there. \n\nDon\u2019t rush anything or do anything you\u2019re not ready for but I really, really hope that you and your sister can find some common ground (for example, my sister and I make a LOT of jokes about the way we were raised and it is genuinely very healing) and start to forge a new dynamic as she matures because neither of you wants to miss out on the awesome adults you\u2019ll get to be together!!!", "All the time.

NTA", "Hmmmm a reeces peanut butter cup\u2026. The plot thickens. Do you think we should contact the United Nations? Maybe have peacekeepers on standby?? Get the Netherlands to supply neutral ground for peaceful negotiations?? Or maybe you get over yourself, move yourself into your own apartment and start acting like a mature adult instead of a little girl. Grow up. You are a 23 year old asshole", "That was beautiful and I hope you come across more sayings like that. Also get a lock box for your things.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop harassing her, and leave her alone. YOu are an abusive AH.", "Don't hesitate to point out the double standard in her insults being made excuses for and yours making you an asshole. They enable her doing these things. We don't get to have the comfort of our parents forever. She will absolutely be miserable in life when (God forbid not for a LONG time) they are gone. And nobody else that she finds to enable her that way will love her or have her best interest in their heart as much as they do. Spare the rod spoil the child", "That\u2019s a really dumb insult. Good job copying shit I guess.", "Get a lock for your room or a cabinet you can lock your stuff inside. Treat her like an asshole roommate you're temporarily forced to share house with.", "The older \u201cchild\u201d is 23 and shouldn\u2019t be babysitting a teenager. OP has confirmed dad has anger problems and is verbally and emotionally abusive. Explains a lot.", "This dynamic has probably been in place for a long time, and the parents haven't bothered to change it up as the girls got older.  What may work reasonably well when the older kid is 13 and the younger is 5 is bound to fail by the time they're 23 and 15.  Father's abusive behavior makes it all much worse, of course.", "I AM GOING TO USE THAT COME BACK!!! NTA", "NTA. Get a lock for your room and go gray rock with your sister - don\u2019t be emotional, don\u2019t respond to any insults and don\u2019t argue about your stuff just quietly take it back if she does and if she starts shouting start talking very quietly or walk away. Be as boring as possible to her. \n\nI would definitely look into overseas jobs. I don\u2019t know your skills / education but you might have language skills that are in demand.", "NTA, I've been in the same boat, op. My mother died, and I was expected to step up and parent my brother. He used to be a nightmare to live with, and dad just wouldn't help the situation at all. My therapist has told me that my brother probly dose resent me little siblings, don't tend to see it as you trying to help them, but as you judging them. You should just choose not to play that role anymore and force your parents to do their job. I know it's easier said than done, but it is worth it. Your relationship will get better when you are older and don't live together. Trust me. In the meantime, I would invest in a lock for your room. That way, she can not take your things.", "NTA.\n\nit might be normal.to live with your parents in your place, but you should really move out.", "Nta. Your family sucks. Put a lock on your door. And maybe a camera. Also take everything she isn't using.", "NTA.\nI feel this so hard. This was me and my sister. Reddit is full of people who believe siblings need to love each other more than life itself though. But many times siblings are just too different. Moving out helped me tremendously but I understand if that isn\u2019t possible. Good luck! (Maybe a cabinet with a lock can help?)", "Great idea, thank you", "What happens if he comes home, the kitchen (your sister was supposed to clean) is dirty, and he goes on a tirade... but you're not there? Does he wait until you get home so you can receive your portion of the tirade?", "NTA - and I'm going to borrow that insult at the next opportune moment.  That was just priceless!", "What a comeback! Well done OP! Mad respect", "NTA. Get a lock or a chest with a lock and put your valuables and things you don't want her to steal in that chest.", "NTA. Beautiful insult. I\u2019m filing that one away for later! She sounds like she can dish it but cannot take it.", "I have a sister who used to help herself to my stuff and my parents wouldn't do anything about it. So I bought a lock for my door. I had to lock it all the time, even when I was in the shower because she would take any opportunity to grab my things.", ">He will fight with everyone. Shout and swesr and call names. Sometimes break a dish or something. My sister will move on pretty quick like nothing happened but it lingers with me\n\nYour dad's abusing alll 3 of you", "Hi OP, I learned to teach at The Language House TEFL in Prague and there was a South African in my class! Check it out, it worked out very well for me.", "NTA Your sister is a brat, she needs to be shown what it's like to have something she likes to be taken and then get screamed at when she brings it up.", "NTA. She deserved it. And it was incredibly clever and quick witted.", "\\*Writes down insult\\* uhuh and then what'd you say? keep going this is gold.  \nAnd NTA, i'm so sorry you've been forced into a parental role with your sister, it's wrong.", "Ohmigosh I actually spit out my drink laughing when I read that insult! I love it! Totally NTA (technically justified asshole) and whew, DM me if you end up telling her any other insults because I'll happily write those down as well", "NTA\n\nBrillant insult also...I'm tucking that into my back pocket to use later. Thank you for that :D\n\nAlso, what are your future living arrangement plans? Would you be in a position to remove yourself from that situation soon? It just sounds like she's testing her limits. Until she starts getting unfavorable consequences, she will always apathetic to you and all that matters to you.\n\nNot sure what her other relationships are like but it could be possible also that she's only ever known this kind of dynamic. Essentially, your anger towards her at least still means someone has to acknowledge her. This is vastly different than her sticking to her space and using only her things in silence which is all housed by people who aren't seeing her for more than an unruly kid.", "Look, you\u2019re an adult. She\u2019s still a child. Your insult wasn\u2019t that bad, but act like an adult. ESH", "You both need to grow up.", "OP, my suggestions:\n\n1. Put a lock on your bedroom door with a key, if you're going to stay at your home. That should eliminate a lot of fights.\n2. Stop telling her what to do. If your mom tells her to clean the kitchen, YOUR MOM can follow up with her and get her to do it, or not. But YOU don't do it for them.\n3. Seriously, stop telling her what to do. If she's going to anger your dad, let her. You ARE acting like her mom. Why? It sounds like she already has a mom telling her what to do. Just start acting like her sister from this point on.", "My sister did it in Japan -- the JET program. I think most countries have their own individual programs, but they have them all over Europe too.", "I went through very similar. I locked my doors whenever I left the room. Everything of real value was hidden away, I only left the stuff I wasn't too bothered about in view (for example I hide my expensive art supplies and left the cheap ones out so when she stole them she viewed it as a victory whereas I never really used the cheaper ones any way so she did me a favour). \n\nI bought an electric safe for the bathroom for my toiletries with a code she'd never guess (alphanumerical). I was lucky enough to have enough room to turn the conservatory attached to my living room into a sort of kitchen but I know most people can't do this so get a small fridge for your important food and lock it in your room. \n\nBasically you either accept the thefts and live miserably or you lock everything up, even if you're just nipping to the loo. Lock your door. Also giving her small victories like I mentioned above. Accidentally leaving cheap toiletries out for her to steal. It's expensive, but it's *less* expensive than her stealing \u00a350 worth of toiletries every time you replace them. Instead get the cheapest shit you can, pour some away to make it look like you use them. If she says anything about your stuff being poorer quality then you just tell her you can't afford to keep replacing stuff every time it vanishes. \n\nI wish I could say it will get better soon but it likely won't. My sister moved in with me and my dad when she was 16. It was *bad* until a couple of years ago when she was about 24 or 25. She made friends online with a counsellor. He helped her see that she needed help so she went to the Dr about anxiety. Obviously didn't mention everything else. Dr put her on medication for anxiety and the first one she tried worked for her. She started to see how she had been behaving, with the help of her friend and started to change. I told everyone for those years that I had no sister, after she assaulted me twice on top of everything else I was beyond done. We now have an OK relationship. If she forgets her meds she reverts but with them she's a functioning human being. \n\nI don't know if your sister needs professional help, or if she's just an entitled brat, but either way unless you get lucky this will not stop. If you can get out then get out. If you can't then you need to take as many steps as you can to trick her and lock things away. If she's stealing important things like technology, jewellery, money, etc then reporting her to the police could be enough of a shock to stop her doing it in future.\n\nAlso, NTA.", "NTA", "Ah I love that insult. I believe the version I heard was something to the effect of \u201cstop wasting the air trees use to breathe.\u201d (Actually I remembered another version \u201cstop wasting the air trees have worked so hard to create\u201d.) one of them is probably more biologically correct then the other lol.\n\nAnother favorite or so I\u2019ve heard is, \u201cyou\u2019re not pretty enough to be that stupid\u201d. Use it as you will, you have my leave to do so.\n\nBut also, I\u2019m sorry. You sound taken advantage of and unsupported by your adult family. I hope things get better for you. And I hope your entitled sister gets better life lessons from somewhere and becomes a better person.", "She ate your Reece's cups????? That's a step too far!!!!!\n\nNTA, the tree line was incredibly reserved, no lines to be crossed unless you aren't allowed to say anything at all.", "Thank you for your advice.", "Sometimes you gotta let people face consequences, whether it's immediate, or 20 years down the line for that kind of entitlement and shitty attitude.", "The thing is, she does it with no problem when I am not here, but if something does happen, he doesn't do as above mentioned, he is just very irritable for the rest of the day", "Personally I'd be trying to figure out how to weaponize his tirades against her.", "Hey OP, I hope one of these programs helps you get out of there. You sound like an amazing person. I'm sorry you are being treated so poorly. I generally won't speak for other people, but I think it's safe to say we're all rooting for you.", "Thank you for this!"]}
