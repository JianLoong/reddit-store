It\u2019s also common for people in different life stages to forget what it was like when they were young and broke, and instead found a cool new place to check out and wanted to invite her bro to also get to check it out.

(Usually McDonalds or Taco Bell, since both of us didn't have too much money, but still.)\n\nAnd then there's you - you need to just communicate the next time she invites you somewhere. You probably did sound rude on the phone. I also think you're taking the Venmo request too personally. If you'd really like to bond with your sister, then be open about your money constraints and then suggest an alternative restaurant that is within your budget. There's no shame in doing this, especially at 20 years old. It's actually the mature move in this situation.

Now, you don\u2019t want to use your words to work through it and try for a compromise restaurant that you could afford. As a result, your sister probably is hurt and feeling rejected.

Did you even ever consider non-money options like going to an outdoor park or having a picnic, beach? Or did you only accept expecting to have a nice meal for free because you seem in your typing you were excited she was \"going to take you out\" rather than \"I was going to enjoy a meal with my sister.\"\n\nAnd frankly, $30 to reconnect with a lost sibling is nothing and you are being stingy as fuck. I bet you ask for a couple bucks when you bring your friends McDonald's.", "Brother. Learn to use your words. She is your sister, just communicate your feelings in a better way than \"eat by yourself\". Don't be afraid to talk about what you're feeling. 99% of relationship issues derive from lack of communication, or miscommunication.\n\nJust talk it through with her. Explain where you're coming from and what happened that day when you were rude. You're trying to reason your way into postponing a conversation that you can be done with in 5 minutes, and will not affect her in a negative way, on the contrary, it will probably take a weight off her shoulders to know that her brother is not an AH.\n\nDon't let it linger, just fix it, the more it lingers the more awkward you'll feel to bring it up.\n\nShe's trying to connect with you too, hence the invites.", "Bro. Say you can't afford it. You literally decided to not bring up your issue then you backhandedly insulted her to eat by herself. Did you even realize her BF was gonna be there and you told her to eat by herself? That by itself shows you just wanted her to feel bad because you yourself feel bad but never even expressed why. \n\nYeah, you were being rude. \n\nYTA.", "On your first paragraph, I'm from a similar culture of paying if you were to formally invite someone out but again, you are applying a level of formality and \"how we treat others\" to your sister, not an other. She wanted to catch up and suggested a chain-restaurant. Presuming this is the US (mostly because $ and your sister being 34 and not fully a doctor yet), I can relate to $30 being brutal when you're flat broke but that's a pretty casual meal if that's what you owed post-tax and tip. \n\nBut regardless of how we differ on the first paragraph above, I still disagree with your approach for the second paragraph. You're creating this massive deal out of this eventual conversation that'll boil down to \"yo I can't afford these places you're picking.\" (Unless the conversation you WANT to have is, you have lost your customs and you should be paying for me if you ever ask if I want to catch up over dinner, in which case, uh, don't.) Which sounds more stressful to you: my brother said hey can we go to cheaper places when we go out to eat I'm an unemployed student OR my brother has suddenly lost all interest in trying to hang out and go out to eat and simply tells me to go eat alone?", "You need to just tell her you can't afford to eat out right now, especially in places like those. \n\n>She is well aware of my financial situation.\n\nIt seems like she isn't, if she's inviting you to $30 lunches. \n\nIf you think she is aware enough to know you can't afford a $30 lunch and expensive meals, then what is your theory behind why she invites you? Do you think she's doing it to antagonize you? Why do you think she would do that? (Sincerely asking this question.)", "You\u2019re welcome! And sure, feel free to post ideas here, or you\u2019re welcome to DM me as well!", "You\u2019re TAH because you were pissed at her from the time before and were rude af to her over the phone instead of actually using your words like an adult and explaining to her \u201cI can\u2019t afford to go somewhere expensive, and while I\u2019d love to see you/spend time with you I\u2019d appreciate it if we went some place cheaper or maybe just cooked something together at one of our places\u201d. How is she supposed to just magically know that she\u2019d upset you when she had no idea you were assuming she\u2019d pay? You say you viewed her highly until this\u2026so you viewed her highly because she\u2019s got money and you had the expectation that she\u2019d pay for you instead of your parents, and when she didn\u2019t pay she\u2019s automatically a disappointment to you? Yikes, my guy.", "Depending on the restaurant, $30 could be a single meal.\n\nSource: I work in a pricy restaurant where our burger is $32 and if you want fries instead of chips, that\u2019s an extra $3. Our least expensive alcoholic drink is like $14 and soda is $5. So minimum your spending before tip and taxes is at least $37. And the price goes up from there. You can easily spend $200 for four people, I\u2019ve seen it happen.", "I think people are viewing this as if I don't eat with her I will never connect with my sister's situation. I still see her at family gatherings every other week and we talk when the siblings get together. I am only posting this here since I was confused that I was called rude for rejecting an invitation to eat with her and her boyfriend without the rest of my family even though we see each other on a regular basis.   \n\n\nIn response to the free alternatives, I have to say I never really thought about that. Thanks for bringing those up (also thanks to the other commenters that brought up those ideas). She does seem busy with her fellowship but I'll suggest these to her and I'll see if I get a positive response for that. Thanks, guys.", "I didn't realize it could be interpreted that way. That was not my intention. I was driving on the highway so I was more focused on the road and spoke poorly. I will apologize for not choosing my words more carefully. I will take this into consideration for my apology to her.", "Thanks for your input. I never really thought of it that way. My parents told me not to do anything to stress her out so I assumed telling her that the places she was choosing were too expensive for me was possibly too critical of her. I was afraid that she was going to take it personally. I might need help wording this conversation. Would you be open to DM's in order to workshop some ways of inoffensive ways to explain my thoughts? I'm trying to be very careful of causing a stress cycle from spiraling into something dangerous.", "I'm afraid I don't know her intention in doing this. Maybe she thought since we did it once, we could do it again. I don't think she meant it maliciously but I also didn't expect her to respond so negatively to my refusal to eat with her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso for those that are posting judgment on why I may or may not be the asshole, it is supposed to be for me just refusing to eat with her. I know that I will have to communicate to her whether or not this was supposed to be her treat or whether I would be responsible to pay. My query is whether I was the AH for refusing a dinner invitation even though I am uncomfortable. Not whether I'm the AH for assuming that she would pay since it's been ingrained in me and my sisters about that specific social custom.", "Ok, this is what I have drafted so far.   \n\n\nHey (sisters name). I hope I didn't interrupt you during anything. I wanted to apologize for the words I said during the earlier conversation when you invited me out to eat. I was in the midst of driving and didn't give it much thought. I realized that those words may have hurt you so I apologize for that. That was never my intention. I wanted to make clear that as of now, I am currently on tight finances. Is it possible to instead eat at (cheaper location that we both like and i can reasonably afford)? If not I still want to spend time with you. Would you be down to visit (park since we both live nearby and it is free) sometime? I can go ask (other sister) if she is interested in a picnic.  \n\n\nI tried to not include \"you\" when I was talking about the difficulty paying since I don't want her to feel attacked.  Also, my thought for asking questions was to hopefully give her the prerogative to respond so it might open the conversation in a less offensive way. Thoughts?", ">u say you viewed her highly until this\u2026so you viewed her highly because she\u2019s got money and you had the e\n\nYou are putting words into my mouth. I still view her highly (present tense) since she is my sister. Not due to money but because she is an older sister in my life and has given me insight into classes, life, and careers. The reason I included that phrase was to indicate that I was surprised she, someone who was preached as the model person in our family, had different social habits than what was taught to us.", "200/4 is 50, so you already are giving sis the benefit of the doubt. Again, we don't know if OP was indulging themselves because it kind of sounds like OP was expecting a free night out and got tight they had to pay some cash. OP never mentioned total cost of bill, what they ordered, etc. There was never a \"I only got one app one drink and the cheapest entree!\" Part of the post. \n\nOP wanted a free gourmet outting at the older sisters expense, then got upset she inviting him again after probably giving him a huge discount on what was actually spent.\n\nAlso, I am so willing to bet they didn't go to Del Frisco's for a $35 burger...", "Dude just tell her you can\u2019t afford it. Why are you jumping through hoops to avoid telling her the real issue? It is way more stressful for her to wonder why you\u2019re \u201crejecting\u201d her than to tell her you enjoy hanging out with her but can\u2019t afford expensive restaurants. That\u2019s not stressful for her to hear at all. \n\nBy telling her the truth you will save both of you a lot of stress and misunderstanding.", "I can literally see her being upset talking to her BF saying things like \"I said you would be there but he told me to eat alone after saying no! Why would he say that?! I just wanted to see him! Does he not like you?\"\n\nBe a fucking grown up and just tell her you are stripped on cash and can't afford to go out. Be an adult and say you had some traditional preconceived notions that because she invited you, she was going to pay (the irony in the gender swap is also fucking hilarious). Explain you are younger and need to budget. \n\nAll of this could have been avoided if you just acted like an adult, but you are young, so take this as a learning experience. Why hide why you are feeling some type of way, especially to family? \n\nIf anything you are now reconnecting on negativity. Is that how you wanted to start this back up?", "I'm off to bed but feel free and I'll respond tomorrow", "Yes, I think this looks great, and has your own personal touch. You apologize, which is great. And, I think you make it clear that you\u2019re on a budget, which was the major issue with the activities that were being suggested before, and you provide multiple options and let her know that you\u2019d still like to spend time with her. It also, as you mentioned, opens the door to further conversation and opportunities to continue to build your relationship. If she still isn\u2019t clear on the budget thing after this, you could always just sort of casually say \u201coh yea, the last place we went was really good, but it was a little out of my price range, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m suggesting something cheaper now.\u201d Something like that would be non-confrontational and chill, but will reinforce your point if for any reason she doesn\u2019t pick it up the first time. It also tosses a positive in there (\u201cThe food was great, but), which I find can help soften the blow when needed.", "The fact you call it social grace... Uhhhhhh, your standards are not everyone's? Woah culture shock is gonna smack you in the FACE when and if you travel and decide to leave your little bubble.", "OP doesn't want to admit he is in a worse financial situation than what appears. He is clearly hiding something and doesn't want family to know.", "Ooh, I really like that response. Thanks for your feedback. I was really dreading bringing this up since I was afraid it was capable of causing something extreme but I really like how you word this conversation. I will definitely remember this response as a contingency in case she inquires about why I couldn't go to her picks. Thanks a lot! You really didn't have to commit so much time but I'm grateful for your thoughtfulness!", "Glad I could potentially help smooth things over! :) And when in doubt, always remember the compliment sandwich: \u201cI\u2019m so happy we can hang out and destress together! My bank account is crying right now so we have to do it cheaply, but if you\u2019re up for it, I know that we\u2019ll have a great time no matter what we do!\u201d So, you\u2019ve got a positive, possible negative, positive. Best of luck, and I hope the convo goes well.", "Knowing I'm going against the grain, NTA.\n\nYou're a 20 year-old college student. Broke is the standard at that time in one's life. Your much older, employed and established siblings inviting you to go to a pricey restaurant and expecting you to pay is myopic at best.", "OP post what you got.", "Yeah, YTA.\n\n1) You don't assume someone is going to pay for you just because they picked the restaurant. This could have been avoided if you were clear with your sister beforehand. I have never in my life paid for someone's meal just because I picked the restaurant, nor has anyone ever paid for me because they picked.\n\n2) Your sister invites you again and instead of talking to her about *why* you don't want to go, you get all weird and tell her you'll think about it. Why not tell her it's not something you can afford or suggest a place that is in your price range?", "I wouldn't necessarily say YTA, but it was unfair of you to expect that she'd pay for your food. You could have asked her. Or, if you didn't feel comfortable doing so, you could have simply said that you don't have enough money to spend on restaurant food.", "While etiquette does state whomever extends the invitation is the one who pays, it's also acceptable and wise to double check as family and close friends often are bound by a different set of rules.", "YTA. Use your words.  You acted like a spoiled child.  \n\nIf you have a problem with her inviting you to eat and not picking up the tab, say that.\n\n*But you couldn\u2019t say that* bc you knew you were an AH for making that assumption in the first place. \n\nSo, instead, you decided to act like a brat.\n\nIt seems everyone in this family has been paying for you to eat except for you.\n\nETA:  based on your comments in this thread, you are massive, entitled asshole.", "YTA and I can see why your relationship was/is bad. Little entitled boy.", "Lol I wrote \u201cuse your words\u201d and then saw your comment, smh", "OMIGOD, grow up!", "You must be insane if you don\u2019t see how this is rude.

No cocktail, no app, nothing too fancy for the main, no dessert.\n\nThat said, when I can afford to go out, I will. But when my sisters visited recently I just told them that $75.00 for dinner (at a pretty decent but not especially fancy place, where that would be the cost of 1 cocktail, a shared app, and a main plus tax/tip) was not in my budget that week.  I invited them to my place for dinner instead. They brought wine; we had a blast.\n\nOP needs to use his words.", "YTA Why couldn\u2019t you just clearly state, \u201cI can\u2019t afford such an expensive restaurant.

Don't talk on the phone while driving, that's really unsafe, not just for you but for the other people on the road. Your goal is to *minimize* your distractions, especially in the evening and at night.\n\nAnd if you actually *looked at your phone* when that Venmo request came in, as you were still behind the wheel, then even more YTA for that.", "> I'm feeling a lot of discomfort since on the one hand I want to tell her that I was displeased with how I had to pay last time,\n\nYou're 20 you can COMMUNICATE like a big boy and tell your sister what's up, she's not a mind reader and your game is stupid\n\n>I also want to bond with my sister who I only just got to know in the past 2 years\n\nDo you though? Because throwing a tantrum like a disgruntled preteen isnt going to build a positive relationship\n\nCan you not ask your sister if she minds paying bc you dont have a job but are still expected to pay your parents rent? She might not realize the financial strain your under. She might just want to spend time with you and might pick a cheaper restaurant. Honestly no telling how she'll react bc you havent even tried to talk to her about it .\n\nYTA bro", "YTA for the way you handled it. \n\nYou should have mentioned that you\u2019re struggling financially and after last time, where you incorrectly assumed she was paying for this pricey place, you\u2019ve realised you cannot afford to eat out with her. Especially when she picks places that are so expensive. \n\nThe way you\u2019ve handled it is just sulking at the situation, which isn\u2019t good for your relationship. Be honest, it\u2019s better for everyone", "NTA.

You cannot afford to eat at fancy restaurants because your not working atm and need to be careful with money. \n\nSo many of these types of situations can be avoided by just simply communicating with each other.", "YTA, but lightly. Honestly I\u2019m the youngest sibling and I totally expect me to sis to pay, not necessarily because I\u2019m broke but because I\u2019m the youngest?? Yeah you should I have just talked to her and explained where you\u2019re coming from", "It's almost like there's no such thing as \"ol' Reddit\" and the comments are made by different people on different days with different opinions.\n\nThe inconsistency you mention could also be due to the advice being given to an inviter and an invitee, and in both cases the advice is to not take advantage / assume.", "YTA, all the way around. Sprout a pair and tell her the truth - that you can't afford to eat at the places she wants to go. It's called adulting - grow up. Your sister is right. You acted like a rude, cowardly little shit."]}
