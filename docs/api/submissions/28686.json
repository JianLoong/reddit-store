Last week it was my wife's birthday and she received a 3000 dollars diamonds necklace from my brother (30M). I was pretty weirded out by this as even tho my brother is far from poor, he's not the type to gift anyone thousands of dollars gifts and he especially never gave my wife something as expensive as this. My wife shrugged it off as it was nothing and my brother was just feeling generous. \n\nHere's where I might be the AH: I still felt uneasy about the gift and so I ended up bringing it up to my brother's wife (30F) and she lost on him. Apparently she never agreed to my brother gifting another woman such an expensive gift. Now both my brother and my wife are mad at me. My brother for creating problems in his marriage and my wife who thinks I only blabbed about my brother's gift for her to my SIL just cause I'm insecure my own birthday gift for her wasn't as expensive (I paid for a full spa day for her, which she really liked, but it indeed wasn't as expensive as my brother's necklace) and who also thinks that SIL is overreacting as she herself received a lot of expensive jewelry from my brother.\n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1697009015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175874v/aita_for_not_feeling_comfortable_with_the_fact/", "score": 4476, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be the other way around too, if my imaginary wife would gift my imaginary brother some expensive Item, without talking to his wife first, red flag, period.\n\nSecond, your own wife shrugged it of as if it was nothing, this red flag is even bigger than the one before. If she doesn't even care to act surprised, then shit is real.\n\nThird flag, you talked to your SIL and **she didn't know about**, and this red flag, is the king of flags for me. Your brother didn't even tell his own wife let alone ask her if she'd be ok with it, before gifting your wife that necklace.\n\nAnd last but not least to hit the ~~bullshit~~ red flag Bingo, now both your wife and your brother blame you for this and what would actually be red flag number 5 but we hit the bingo so we let is slide, is your own wife trying to gaslight you with telling you that you feel insecure because your own gift wasn't that expensive.\n\nIf i was in your shoes, i'd talk to my SIL and start operation Necklace right about now.\n\nSomething her stinks and my best guess, either your brother wants your wife or he's already got her, either way be on your toes, i wish you the best of luck\n\nBtw. you talking to your SIL is the only normal thing that happened here, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. \n\nEdit: NTA, obviously", "NTA - you don't upstage a husband by giving his wife a 3k necklace ... that's odd behavior, and I would be rather suspicious about it, especially since BIL lied to his own wife about the gift.\n\nETA: A lot of people are sure there is cheating going on, and that's not an unreasonable guess, but OP, does your brother have a history of just upstaging you in general?  Maybe he has a crush on your wife and he wanted to show off, and he just doesn't care that it was a dick move?  Either way, your brother should have never done this, especially not without speaking to you about it first.", "NTA \n\nAre you sure it\u2019s a real diamond necklace? I can\u2019t imagine any situation where this would be appropriate unless your wife and brother are involved in a romantic way. \n\nAlso, you did not cause marital problems between your brother and SIL. He did that when he decided to splurge on a woman who is not his wife and did not bother consulting his wife on such a large purchase. \n\nSomething is fishy.", "It seems a strange way to let everyone know you're fucking your brother's wife. Even weirder,  after making it so obvious, they both act like it's all normal and nothing's going on.", "NTA. Let's break it down. Your brother and your wife are dancing horizontally.\n\nThey think you're too dumb to notice, and as a private joke between them he gave her an expensive necklace in front of you. They thought they would be able to get away with being blatant about their relationship.\n\nYou stuffed things up by contacting the SIL, who has a few dozen more IQ points than your good self and recognizes horizontal dancing when she sees it. \n\nThat's what this is about.", "Is someone gonna tell him?", "NTA\n\nEveryone is going to assume your brother and wife are having an affair, but I think the truth is much more sinister. The necklace is cursed. Bringing it into your home will attract the attentions of the Old Ones. Disavow your brother (he's trying to kill you), and abandon your wife (she's already come to their attention, it's too late for her). Rescue your SiL and flee.", "NTA \n\nAs you've stated that's odd behaviour from him and the only reason he's angry is because his wife is pissed at him because she smells a rat too\n\nIt's a little odd that your wife hasnt been atleast a little confused over it too...", "NTA\n\nbut lets face it there is more to this than meets the eye.\n\na brother doesn't gift expensive jewellery to their SIL (your wife) unless something is going on.\n\nThe question has to be asked are they being faithful? His wife's and your wife's reaction to you speaking to your SIL about it would indicate they are not!\n\nSorry", "NTA \n\nAs others have stated, I'd look into your wife's activities. A $3k necklace for someone you've been married to for a year? Little suspicious. The fact that she wrote off the SIL receiving similar gifts from her husband is also odd. Your wife must realize that she and the SIL are in a different class when it comes to importance for your brother, unless she doesn't because she is cheating.", "INFO: Any signs that your wife is cheating?", "NTA\n\nEven if they are not having an affair your brother likes your wife. He didn't tell his wife he bought the necklace. It's weird.", "Bro.", "Was the gift about impressing your wife or making you look small? Is your relationship with your brother a good one or is there tension. Your wife\u2019s nonchalant reaction is very concerning, his wife\u2019s is justified.", "I'd confront him about it, maybe not fully mad but just like, asking why. Is Mom involved in your lives or still alive? Maybe he didn't pay as much as you think it cost? He obviously appreciates her a lot and you need to figure out why he would go all out for her when he doesn't do it for everyone including his wife.", "lol NTA. You didn't create any problems your brother did. Clearly this is pretty fishy with your brother lying to his wife and your wife gaslighting you. Your brother knew it was a weird thing to do which is why he never told his wife. And your wife knows its weird which is why she upset rather then surprised or confused.  After all if they both thought they actually did nothing wrong then they shouldn't have expected you to keep it a secret either", "Only situation where it doesn't feel weird is if your brother is a millionaire and usually buy expensive stuff to all his relatives\n\n\nEven if it's the case, I think it's a huge disrespect to both you and his wife to not mention the idea to you before buying the necklace\n\nAnd your wife reaction in front of the gift is REALLY weird, I don't imagine \"normal\" people not reacting in front of a diamond necklace, as if it wasn't a Big deal\n\nHell, who gives diamonds without implying \" I wanna Fuck with you for the rest of my life \", diamonds are for lovers in common culture \n\nI really hope there's a blind spot in your story, and it was just a misunderstanding ( your wife not reacting to not make you feel as shit more than you already were in front of the gift ; your bro not talking to both you and his wife about the gift because both of you would have disagree about him buying it )\n\nBut the story is really weird, and that's a huge disrespect from the bro for doing this without any consulting \n\nDefinitly NTA even if there's nothing between them, everybody would feel suspicious in your situation", "I\u2019m not badly off and my wife and I both have our own bank accounts as well as our joint ones, but even so, if I spent 3k of my own money on another woman, without discussing it with my wife, she\u2019d be rightfully pissed! \n\nI don\u2019t understand how bro thought he was going to do this without it potentially getting back to his wife!\n\nRegardless of whether you told her or not, he shouldn\u2019t have done it!", "NTA\u2026. There is definitely something shifty about that especially since his wife had no idea\u2026", "NTA\n\n$3000 is too much generosity...\n\nI'll be waiting for your next post where you confirm they are having an affair...", "How did the $3k price come up? Was the price tag on the gift? Did brother say that it cost that much?", "NTA. Your wife completely misunderstood\nthe reason you mentioned such an inappropriate gift to SIL. How does she not see that SIL receiving expensive gifts from her husband is completely different? Are you sure there isn\u2019t something going on with those two?", "NTA. If my own husband gave me a 3k necklace I\u2019d be wondering what on earth did he do because clearly the man\u2019s trying to apologize or something. \n\nThe fact your brother gave it to YOUR wife is FISHY. I would be 100% convinced he\u2019s sleeping with her. Bare minimum he wants her but she\u2019s been rejecting him. \n\nNTA. I would be so mad and concerned.

I\u2019m a person that sees the good and the bad in things and I can honestly say I only see the bad. The brother gifting the necklace (red flag), brother hiding it from SIL (BIGGEST red flag), GF mad and calling you insecure over your concern (bigger red flag), GF calling you insecure because of your gift (big red flag). Time for you and SIL to put up cameras around each other\u2019s house", "NTA Stop asking or confronting them about anything and just watch their actions closely and ask your SIL to do the same lol", "There is something real fishy going on.. I dont know if there is a sexual relationship going on between these two or not but it sure aschell is suspicious as fuck!!\n\nNTA, you are right about not being comfortable with such an expensive gift from your BROTHER to your WIFE!\n\nI would suggest keeping a close eye on both of them.. something is not right here", "NTA\n\n\nI know it\u2019s hard but are you sure the two aren\u2019t cheating on you?", "NTA and that expensive a gift, and without clearing it with his wife!, is weird as hell.

If I was the wife (loyal to my husband), i'd be damned confused. I'd even go to my husband and ask wtf did your brother sniff? did he win the lottery? is he laundering money? i don't want to accept illegal shit lol\n\nthat amount is NOT something to shrug off. i suggest OP and SIL to let it go and start gathering more info.", "Yeah, I'd hazard a guess they've been bumping uglies behind yours and your brothers wife's backs.", "NTA, but there is something wrong... Be prepared pal!", "Here's the question, what would your bro get you for a birthday gift? Maybe he has the cash, like it's no big deal to him, so why not? And why not let your wife have something nice? If he wouldn't similarly spend that much on you like if he gets her this necklace but then for your bday gets you like a bottle of whisky or scotch or something then yeah the gift would be way out of line", "It\u2019s odd everyone knows it\u2019s a 3k necklace, did he leave the price tag on it or announce the price? Neither sound plausible and as a result I doubt your story.", "Definitely Red flag, might check to see if your wife is receiving pearl necklaces from your brother on the side.

But that must be some bangin good good your wife be slangin.", "NTA - get him on here to explain himself... \n\nHe's either interested in her, or interested in making you look bad, and read the comments to give him some perspective.\n\nHis wife is right to question him and lose her shit.", "NTA.

Your wife and brother should recognize that, but are likely choosing not to. \n\n\nHate to be (another) that guy, but you need to consider how much they talk, see each other without you, and what other gifts have may have been in the past.

Last week it was my wife's birthday and she received a 3000 dollars diamonds necklace from my brother (30M). I was pretty weirded out by this as even tho my brother is far from poor, he's not the type to gift anyone thousands of dollars gifts and he especially never gave my wife something as expensive as this. My wife shrugged it off as it was nothing and my brother was just feeling generous. \n\nHere's where I might be the AH: I still felt uneasy about the gift and so I ended up bringing it up to my brother's wife (30F) and she lost on him. Apparently she never agreed to my brother gifting another woman such an expensive gift. Now both my brother and my wife are mad at me. My brother for creating problems in his marriage and my wife who thinks I only blabbed about my brother's gift for her to my SIL just cause I'm insecure my own birthday gift for her wasn't as expensive (I paid for a full spa day for her, which she really liked, but it indeed wasn't as expensive as my brother's necklace) and who also thinks that SIL is overreacting as she herself received a lot of expensive jewelry from my brother.\n\nAITA ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Of course his wife would be pissed off! You're wife should understand why this was in issue for his wife. Your BIL can get his wife lots and lots of expensive jewelry but thinking that SIL is overreacting because of this is bizarre. Your wife is not his wife and is not entitled to the same level of gifts, end of. \n\nYour brother has no right to be mad at you. The guy didn't even tell his wife which again is another red flag.

If there was maybe a pretense to the gift then maybe I could understand it. \n\nFor instance. Me and my partner gave our friend a very nice gift for their birthday because they helped us with a legal matter (Real estate) service gratis. So it was like a thank you. But that was from us both and to a friend. \n\nNot saying someone can't be friends with their in laws. It's just seems a bit off the brothers wife wasn't told about the gift.

Is it because it *looks bad*?). But that\u2019s their marriage. So ok. \n\nBut not telling OP is what points to real negative intent.

Been too long since I did a rewatch", "Lol well the context of that wouldn\u2019t make it weird. But if my father in law (who isn\u2019t in to jewelry) got me a 3k necklace without telling my MIL, yes that would be extremely weird.", "Human psychology is weird, and if this is what\u2019s happening it\u2019s probably not a conscious thing. So the \u201csudden change\u201d would be because this thing in particular tripped the \u201cyes shiny object\u201d part of her brain and subconsciously she is justifying that it must be normal.", "Everything you pointed out is super sketchy. I can\u2019t think of a situation, and we\u2019ve bought some expensive gifts in the past, but in every case we bought them. Not just me, or just my wife, both of us together sat down and talked about expensive gifts (almost all have been our son/daughter-in-law). I\u2019d be really weirded out if I was the SIL, especially about how often he gives such generous gifts.", "The only way this would Not be a red flag if the wife had given her kidney to the brother in law and he lived and was eternally grateful for, gave bone marrow to him or his kids or saved his kids from a burning fire or some extraordinary thing that I could never repay. These are all fantastical scenarios that are unlikely to happen. The brother is in love with the wife. Or is manic.", "True BUT the big issue was the kind of lack of embarrassment or whatnot.  Like even just a sentence where OPs wife asks OP if its ok to take such an expensive gift.  Then tie in the fact his brothers WIFE didn't know and that just solidifies a) they cheating or b) brother has to upstage OP. Both looks arent good\n\nOh and his wife's justification that brother buys his wife expensive things and its no big deal makes me question if she feels on par with brothers wife (eg equals)", "Added with the red flag of her blowing it off saying that his wife also gets expensive gifts. This is just all around fishy.", "Yeah, I'd bet money these two are cheating or want to cheat. If I were OP, I wouldn't let this go. If a man gave me a gift that expensive, I'd give it back and tell him that was inappropriate. Heck, when I was single, a guy tried to buy me a car, and I turned him down. It meant he had feelings for me, and I didn't have them for him, so it felt wrong to accept.\n\nI don't know, OP, but I'd be doing some digging.", "I've mentioned on another post that my aunt's husband, one year, told their kids they didn't have much money for Christmas.\n\nMy aunt then saw on a bank statement a charge for an expensive bracelet. More than she would want spent on herself when they have the three kids and not what she'd asked for, as she is a practically minded woman. However she knew who it had been bought for, a family 'friend'. She went and confronted the woman, who swore that she had never given him any reason to believe there was anything there. (She was/is married.)\n\nAunt then had a blazing row with her husband in which he asked her if she wanted the bracelet instead. You can imagine how that went.\n\nHe just moped around sulking because he'd been caught. \n\nThey're still married. I'd have killed him and fed him to a neighbours pig long ago.", ">And last but not least to hit the   \n>  \n>bullshit  \n>  \n> red flag Bingo, now both your wife and your brother blame you for this and what would actually be red flag number 5 but we hit the bingo so we let is slide, is your own wife trying to gaslight you with telling you that you feel insecure because your own gift wasn't that expensive.\n\nIn this game of Bingo, the FREE SPACE is the gaslighting.  \n\nNTA.", "Gold star. This smells of an affair. I'd encourage OP to consider this possibility, while remembering that you don't nuke your relationship until you know for certain there's a reason to nuke it. Echoing the point someone else made: don't accuse her of cheating or even talking about that concern until you're certain beyond any doubt or else you're ready for her to break up. Because you can't unring that bell. \n\nNTA", "This response nails it. Only thing I can add is, in a couple situation, what husband gifts his SIL as an individual?\n\nIts one thing for his wife to be unaware, but couples gift as couples. It is totally creepy that bro gives wife in this way. Worse that it is inappropriately expensive. Some would argue that jewelry is way too personal on its own. \n\nOP's wife should be sponging the ooze of this off of her, not berating OP for being concerned. Red Flag Bingo is right!", "We all know the only reason you would freely give another woman other than your wife an expensive jewelry is because you may be expecting something in return, like a favor unless it\u2019s already done. And the fact that it is not discussed with his wife is astoundingly clear there is something going on. Time to do detective work my man and free yourself of any baggage.", "agreed. maybe its growing up poorer, but 3k for a gift that isn't a car, engagement ring, or helping with college/house downpayment is... well, unfathomable. I wouldn't accept it, and I definitely wouldn't accept it if their partner didn't know.", "NTA. If anyone but my husband got me a gift that expensive, I would be very uncomfortable and I think that's pretty common for people in relationships. I would also be mad he spent that much on me.\n\nIf my husband spent that much on someone else without talking to me, especially another woman, I'd lose my absolute shit. \n\nSomething isn't right here.", "Ah yes, the horizontal mambo", "Or he is having a manic episode", "Dang, he could have at least gotten you the same coat.", "Exactly. I mean if the guy was loaded and gave those kinds of gifts to everyone, that would be different. But this scenario, I would give major side eye \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude12. The brother wants OP's wife for himself or is already cheating with her.", "Oh yeah or either they\u2019re about to. OP seems genuine and really just needs the best advice and Operation Necklace and have SIL in on it and get to the bottom of this weirdo shit", "To love so recklessly, get shattered, and then to dare to love recklessly again. A fool for love, perhaps, but a brave and true lover you are.", "Honestly in these situations once someone is married, couple's presents in general feel like the best way to go - maybe a slightly personalised gift each if you're getting said person a couple of things, but the fact he's gone out on his own and done this is so odd.", "Yep. The only scenario this could go back to normal with is:\n\nSo I asked my sil. Turns out he gifted it to her first, but she didn't like it. The stores 30 day return policy meant it was to late to take it back, so we decided to gift it to your wife. \n\nNotice how the wife was involved in that scenario above? Too bad it didn't flow like that!", "Facts....   The fact that the mrs and bil is acting as if that type of behavior is normal is disturbing on so many levels...", "Yeah that part is weird of course the SIL would get nice gift it the brothers wife", "You\u2019re right maybe he just wants to. Or she caught him cheating or something else he doesn\u2019t want anyone to know about and it\u2019s a bribe.", "Yes it\u2019s the not talking to the wife that makes it suspicious to me. At least in my family couples pretty much give gifts together or at least they know what the other person is getting for friends and relatives"]}
