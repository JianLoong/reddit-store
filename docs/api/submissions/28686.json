Last week it was my wife's birthday and she received a 3000 dollars diamonds necklace from my brother (30M). I was pretty weirded out by this as even tho my brother is far from poor, he's not the type to gift anyone thousands of dollars gifts and he especially never gave my wife something as expensive as this. My wife shrugged it off as it was nothing and my brother was just feeling generous. \n\nHere's where I might be the AH: I still felt uneasy about the gift and so I ended up bringing it up to my brother's wife (30F) and she lost on him. Apparently she never agreed to my brother gifting another woman such an expensive gift. Now both my brother and my wife are mad at me. My brother for creating problems in his marriage and my wife who thinks I only blabbed about my brother's gift for her to my SIL just cause I'm insecure my own birthday gift for her wasn't as expensive (I paid for a full spa day for her, which she really liked, but it indeed wasn't as expensive as my brother's necklace) and who also thinks that SIL is overreacting as she herself received a lot of expensive jewelry from my brother.\n\nAITA ?", "created_utc": 1697009015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175874v/aita_for_not_feeling_comfortable_with_the_fact/", "score": 1020, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be the other way around too, if my imaginary wife would gift my imaginary brother some expensive Item, without talking to his wife first, red flag, period.\n\nSecond, your own wife shrugged it of as if it was nothing, this red flag is even bigger than the one before. If she doesn't even care to act surprised, then shit is real.\n\nThird flag, you talked to your SIL and **she didn't know about**, and this red flag, is the king of flags for me. Your brother didn't even tell his own wife let alone ask her if she'd be ok with it, before gifting your wife that necklace.\n\nAnd last but not least to hit the ~~bullshit~~ red flag Bingo, now both your wife and your brother blame you for this and what would actually be red flag number 5 but we hit the bingo so we let is slide, is your own wife trying to gaslight you with telling you that you feel insecure because your own gift wasn't that expensive.\n\nIf i was in your shoes, i'd talk to my SIL and start operation Necklace right about now.\n\nSomething her stinks and my best guess, either your brother wants your wife or he's already got her, either way be on your toes, i wish you the best of luck\n\nBtw. you talking to your SIL is the only normal thing that happened here, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. \n\nEdit: NTA, obviously", "NTA - you don't upstage a husband by giving his wife a 3k necklace ... that's odd behavior, and I would be rather suspicious about it, especially since BIL lied to his own wife about the gift.\n\nETA: A lot of people are sure there is cheating going on, and that's not an unreasonable guess, but OP, does your brother have a history of just upstaging you in general?  Maybe he has a crush on your wife and he wanted to show off, and he just doesn't care that it was a dick move?  Either way, your brother should have never done this, especially not without speaking to you about it first.", "NTA \n\nAre you sure it\u2019s a real diamond necklace? I can\u2019t imagine any situation where this would be appropriate unless your wife and brother are involved in a romantic way. \n\nAlso, you did not cause marital problems between your brother and SIL. He did that when he decided to splurge on a woman who is not his wife and did not bother consulting his wife on such a large purchase. \n\nSomething is fishy.", "It seems a strange way to let everyone know you're fucking your brother's wife. Even weirder,  after making it so obvious, they both act like it's all normal and nothing's going on.", "NTA. Let's break it down. Your brother and your wife are dancing horizontally.\n\nThey think you're too dumb to notice, and as a private joke between them he gave her an expensive necklace in front of you. They thought they would be able to get away with being blatant about their relationship.\n\nYou stuffed things up by contacting the SIL, who has a few dozen more IQ points than your good self and recognizes horizontal dancing when she sees it. \n\nThat's what this is about.", "Is someone gonna tell him?", "NTA\n\nEveryone is going to assume your brother and wife are having an affair, but I think the truth is much more sinister. The necklace is cursed. Bringing it into your home will attract the attentions of the Old Ones. Disavow your brother (he's trying to kill you), and abandon your wife (she's already come to their attention, it's too late for her). Rescue your SiL and flee.", "NTA \n\nAs you've stated that's odd behaviour from him and the only reason he's angry is because his wife is pissed at him because she smells a rat too\n\nIt's a little odd that your wife hasnt been atleast a little confused over it too...", "NTA\n\nbut lets face it there is more to this than meets the eye.\n\na brother doesn't gift expensive jewellery to their SIL (your wife) unless something is going on.\n\nThe question has to be asked are they being faithful? His wife's and your wife's reaction to you speaking to your SIL about it would indicate they are not!\n\nSorry", "NTA \n\nAs others have stated, I'd look into your wife's activities. A $3k necklace for someone you've been married to for a year? Little suspicious. The fact that she wrote off the SIL receiving similar gifts from her husband is also odd. Your wife must realize that she and the SIL are in a different class when it comes to importance for your brother, unless she doesn't because she is cheating.", "INFO: Any signs that your wife is cheating?", "NTA\n\nEven if they are not having an affair your brother likes your wife. He didn't tell his wife he bought the necklace. It's weird.", "Bro.", "Was the gift about impressing your wife or making you look small? Is your relationship with your brother a good one or is there tension. Your wife\u2019s nonchalant reaction is very concerning, his wife\u2019s is justified.", "I'd confront him about it, maybe not fully mad but just like, asking why. Is Mom involved in your lives or still alive? Maybe he didn't pay as much as you think it cost? He obviously appreciates her a lot and you need to figure out why he would go all out for her when he doesn't do it for everyone including his wife.", "lol NTA. You didn't create any problems your brother did. Clearly this is pretty fishy with your brother lying to his wife and your wife gaslighting you. Your brother knew it was a weird thing to do which is why he never told his wife. And your wife knows its weird which is why she upset rather then surprised or confused.  After all if they both thought they actually did nothing wrong then they shouldn't have expected you to keep it a secret either", "Only situation where it doesn't feel weird is if your brother is a millionaire and usually buy expensive stuff to all his relatives\n\n\nEven if it's the case, I think it's a huge disrespect to both you and his wife to not mention the idea to you before buying the necklace\n\nAnd your wife reaction in front of the gift is REALLY weird, I don't imagine \"normal\" people not reacting in front of a diamond necklace, as if it wasn't a Big deal\n\nHell, who gives diamonds without implying \" I wanna Fuck with you for the rest of my life \", diamonds are for lovers in common culture \n\nI really hope there's a blind spot in your story, and it was just a misunderstanding ( your wife not reacting to not make you feel as shit more than you already were in front of the gift ; your bro not talking to both you and his wife about the gift because both of you would have disagree about him buying it )\n\nBut the story is really weird, and that's a huge disrespect from the bro for doing this without any consulting \n\nDefinitly NTA even if there's nothing between them, everybody would feel suspicious in your situation", "I\u2019m not badly off and my wife and I both have our own bank accounts as well as our joint ones, but even so, if I spent 3k of my own money on another woman, without discussing it with my wife, she\u2019d be rightfully pissed! \n\nI don\u2019t understand how bro thought he was going to do this without it potentially getting back to his wife!\n\nRegardless of whether you told her or not, he shouldn\u2019t have done it!", "NTA\u2026. There is definitely something shifty about that especially since his wife had no idea\u2026", "NTA\n\n$3000 is too much generosity...\n\nI'll be waiting for your next post where you confirm they are having an affair...", "How did the $3k price come up? Was the price tag on the gift? Did brother say that it cost that much?", "NTA. Your wife completely misunderstood\nthe reason you mentioned such an inappropriate gift to SIL. How does she not see that SIL receiving expensive gifts from her husband is completely different? Are you sure there isn\u2019t something going on with those two?", "NTA. If my own husband gave me a 3k necklace I\u2019d be wondering what on earth did he do because clearly the man\u2019s trying to apologize or something. \n\nThe fact your brother gave it to YOUR wife is FISHY. I would be 100% convinced he\u2019s sleeping with her. Bare minimum he wants her but she\u2019s been rejecting him. \n\nNTA. I would be so mad and concerned.

I\u2019m a person that sees the good and the bad in things and I can honestly say I only see the bad. The brother gifting the necklace (red flag), brother hiding it from SIL (BIGGEST red flag), GF mad and calling you insecure over your concern (bigger red flag), GF calling you insecure because of your gift (big red flag). Time for you and SIL to put up cameras around each other\u2019s house", "NTA Stop asking or confronting them about anything and just watch their actions closely and ask your SIL to do the same lol", "There is something real fishy going on.. I dont know if there is a sexual relationship going on between these two or not but it sure aschell is suspicious as fuck!!\n\nNTA, you are right about not being comfortable with such an expensive gift from your BROTHER to your WIFE!\n\nI would suggest keeping a close eye on both of them.. something is not right here", "NTA\n\n\nI know it\u2019s hard but are you sure the two aren\u2019t cheating on you?", "NTA and that expensive a gift, and without clearing it with his wife!, is weird as hell.

If I was the wife (loyal to my husband), i'd be damned confused. I'd even go to my husband and ask wtf did your brother sniff? did he win the lottery? is he laundering money? i don't want to accept illegal shit lol\n\nthat amount is NOT something to shrug off. i suggest OP and SIL to let it go and start gathering more info.", "Yeah, I'd hazard a guess they've been bumping uglies behind yours and your brothers wife's backs.", "NTA, but there is something wrong... Be prepared pal!", "Here's the question, what would your bro get you for a birthday gift? Maybe he has the cash, like it's no big deal to him, so why not? And why not let your wife have something nice? If he wouldn't similarly spend that much on you like if he gets her this necklace but then for your bday gets you like a bottle of whisky or scotch or something then yeah the gift would be way out of line", "It\u2019s odd everyone knows it\u2019s a 3k necklace, did he leave the price tag on it or announce the price? Neither sound plausible and as a result I doubt your story.", "Definitely Red flag, might check to see if your wife is receiving pearl necklaces from your brother on the side.

But that must be some bangin good good your wife be slangin.", "NTA - get him on here to explain himself... \n\nHe's either interested in her, or interested in making you look bad, and read the comments to give him some perspective.\n\nHis wife is right to question him and lose her shit.", "NTA.

Your wife and brother should recognize that, but are likely choosing not to. \n\n\nHate to be (another) that guy, but you need to consider how much they talk, see each other without you, and what other gifts have may have been in the past.

Last week it was my wife's birthday and she received a 3000 dollars diamonds necklace from my brother (30M). I was pretty weirded out by this as even tho my brother is far from poor, he's not the type to gift anyone thousands of dollars gifts and he especially never gave my wife something as expensive as this. My wife shrugged it off as it was nothing and my brother was just feeling generous. \n\nHere's where I might be the AH: I still felt uneasy about the gift and so I ended up bringing it up to my brother's wife (30F) and she lost on him. Apparently she never agreed to my brother gifting another woman such an expensive gift. Now both my brother and my wife are mad at me. My brother for creating problems in his marriage and my wife who thinks I only blabbed about my brother's gift for her to my SIL just cause I'm insecure my own birthday gift for her wasn't as expensive (I paid for a full spa day for her, which she really liked, but it indeed wasn't as expensive as my brother's necklace) and who also thinks that SIL is overreacting as she herself received a lot of expensive jewelry from my brother.\n\nAITA ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Of course his wife would be pissed off! You're wife should understand why this was in issue for his wife. Your BIL can get his wife lots and lots of expensive jewelry but thinking that SIL is overreacting because of this is bizarre.

And unless his brother earns at 6 or 7 figure salary it's almost  waterproof evidence for cheating or the intention to do so. Here an normal present for an in law would be in the 50-100 dollar range. And the playing on OP's insecurity is a real dickmove on his wife's part", "He did speak to his wife.... She attempted to gaslight him that's he's just insecure because of his own gift..", "Yes! Great advice", "You're either a very trusting individual from a bygone era. Or you're incredibly naive..", "This is everything you probably thought on your own but were being gaslit into doubting those thoughts. \n\nDude made a clean sweep here. I thought the exact same thing but couldn't be bothered typing it all out, I'm glad someone did.\n\nAlways come back to this post when you need assurance.", "I disagree. \n\nShe gaslit him. There's no point in talking to a liar over and over. It won't get you anywhere. \n\nI have been married to an addict who could lie straight to my face, looking me right in the eyes, like it was nothing. I wasted way too much time trying to talk. \n\nHire a PI today. \n\nDon't waste your time trying to reason with a liar or asking questions they won't answer truthfully.", "Sounds like the brother is trying to 1up the husband to get a young girls attention. \n\nBut as always, communication is key.\n\nEdit: we don't know these people's incomes.

Unless it's a big occasion like a wedding or moving to a new house or something", "We dont really know what the SIL gets, but it is mentioned in the text, that his wife said that his SIL overreacts because she gets such gifts too.", "I dont know, i think the Stereotype that your dad is as surprised as you what he got you for Christmas, is a bit outdated, and frankly shows the lack of interested if anything on your dad sides.\n\nI buy my own gifts and i sometimes do even in relationships, i like to gift people things they need/can use in their day to day live, so if my SO wants to gift my brother a pair of socks that i know he will never wear, then she can buy that herself and i will buy him new BBQ tongs, because he complained about the old ones all summer.   \n\n\nDont get me wrong, we still make it one gift and everything, but my SO is not always present when i give him his gift, well sometimes i am not present. That's what a job and other responsibilities can do to you, sadly. \n\nYou are right with the rest about 3k and everyhing, however even there is a fine line", "Maybe OP will give us an update at some point, i really hope im wrong, but everything points in the other direction tbh", "That doesn't explain OP's wife's odd behavior.", "Compounded with the fact brother's wife did not know. If it was just upstaging the brother, the wife would have known. The secrecy from his spouse does not match simply trying to upstage OP (especially with OP's wife reaction, gaslighting, and calling SIL overreacting because she also gets such gifts).", "r/angryupvote", "And those don't cost a dime!", "Yep. OP seems to be the kind of person who can be gaslit or conned with no effort, so they\u2019re doing just that.", "Funniest comment", "I came here to say this!", "I\u2019m glad you can still be dumbly in love. It\u2019s a testament to your resilience to not take the suspicion and lack of trust forward.", "I wonder when it will be, will it be when his brothers moves in after splitting up with SiL, when he catches his wife being rammed by brother, or when she takes his house in the divorce ?\n\nLet's take bets.", "Not me.", "Not it!", "The only responsible thing to do is admit that, even though all the facts in evidence point in that direction, we don't know the whole story", "he should check for pearl necklace", "If MY OWN husband got me that id want him to return it. A 3k necklace?! In this economy? They\u2019re 100% having an affair or they eat with disposable diamond paper towels and wipe their butts with fine China. Since I\u2019m guessing they aren\u2019t THAT kinda rich, affair or brother having a creepy crush on his wife are the only two real options I see here\u2026. \n\nBut from wife\u2019s non-reaction, I\u2019d bet money on affair\u2026.", "Lmao. I ended up having to read the whole post to my boyfriend because of how I laughed at your comment.", "Well done Sir", "xD", "I\u2019d love to know if he left the sticker on.

Also, if something like this happens, SIIL has a right to know. Only people who are AHs here are the brother for the inappropriate gift and the wife for raising a fuss. I would be more than curious if someone gave my partner a $3K piece of jewellery out of the blue.", "I don't think it's wierd at all! If someone gave my wife a $3000, I would be doubting the reasons for sutch a present...\n\n...and if it was given by a married man, I would talk to his wife to know if she had agreed on something like that. If she knew and agreed, I would just shut up...\n\n...but if she didn't... Well, there's no smoke without a fire...", "Most certainly this is what his plan was. \"Oh yeah?? You wanna gift my wife a 3k piece of jewelry ?!?! I'll show you!!\"", "Chill out lad, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.

Then talks to me and we together with his wife and discuss this if it would be appropriate for them gifting my wife this expensive machine. I think i wouldnt have a problem with it, even tho i have a hard time accepting handouts. \n\nBut his? I mean, jewellery and that expensive? Shit, i wouldnt pay that much for an engagement ring", "I make the higher ranges of salary and would not consider giving my SIL such a gift.  I gave one to my wife as a surprise a couple of years ago and she fell off her chair.  This is weird.  Although I agree it\u2019s not definitive evidence of cheating, I would be having a frank conversation with my wife and another with my brother. NTA.", "It would be the same here in the US. A present costing that range would only make sense if your wealthy.", "Exactly, time for a PI and check her cellphone before she erases any trace. If they haven't cheated physically, at least this smells to an emotional affair.", "Maybe she just really badly wants it to be ok for her to keep the crazy expensive gift rather than have to return it.", "Funny, and possibly correct!", "The Update is gonna be gold", "Maybe his wife just ate something salty", "same", "You must be the brother. Few paragraphs? Some people love being blind.", "If that was the case the wife (should have) reacted MUCH differently than she did. The fact that the wife is trying to minimize the significance of such a gift means she knows the real significance of it and doesn\u2019t want that known. That heavily implies an affair. \n\nNormal people who get $3k presents from anyone NOT their rich spouse/occasional parent, out of the blue for the first time in knowing them for several years are at least surprised. They don\u2019t just shrug it off as nothing.", "^ Bot comment, copied from one below.

And not just a little bit funny\u2026", "Yea 3k worth of jewellery and not talking to anyone about of beforehand, takes the cake for me.\n\nIf you add all the gaslighting and victim blaming on top, i dont see how this will end well"]}
