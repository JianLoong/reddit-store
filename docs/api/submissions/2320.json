I cook huge elaborate meals too and while my husband doesn't complain about the amount of dishes I generate I do notice dishes pile up when I cook. So because of this I've tried to do one pot meals as often as I can to help cut down on my own mess. Granted this is difficult during dinner because we have a big family, but many OP can do more one pot type meals or cook things like bread or rolls earlier in the day, clean that, and then eat it for dinner. Or instead of not cooking they can just not prepare extras like salads and rolls as a way of cutting back.", "YTA. Solve the problem by each doing your own dishes. If that\u2019s a problem then he\u2019s probably right that you\u2019re using too many dishes.", "NTA", "NTA. I have gone on cleaning and cooking strikes in the past. Help or do it yourself", "NTA. Please stop helping him if he won't help you. A marriage is a partnership. Fair is fair.", "NTA\nGirl run or have a long hard chat about his entitled, 1950s esque attitude", "I cook, he cleans. He cooks, I clean. \nThis is very uneven because I clean as I go and he does not. But, it's what we agreed on and it works for us.", "NTA, but it could be the next step to the divorce.  If you two don't resolve your issues amicably, and preferably with professional help, soon, that light at the end of the tunnel is actually the divorce train barreling down the tracks at you.", "This is one of my favourite couples' squabble. \n\nNTA.\n\nFind yourself a simple casserole recipe, a one pot meal. Only make that one on your turns. For as long as it takes.", "why should she have to, the person who's not cooking should be cleaning", "Honestly one time my husband made a sandwich and somehow used three knives, 4 plates and I think a couple pots of pans? I honestly don\u2019t know. He does the dinner cooking and I do all dishes but sometimes it feels like he uses every dish in the kitchen", "I wouldnT even make the Pb&j.", "NTA, your husband however\u2026 Red Flag city. No one asked him, but he volunteered \u201cI\u2019m not helping you.\u201d  Sounds like he\u2019s trying to establish what is your work and what is his work.  I concur with others here, if he can\u2019t be bothered to clean dishes when you cook, then don\u2019t cook for him.", "NTA \n\nEveryone is a contributing adult and should be doing their part. However, pettiness is a slippery slope to resentment. Not a great place for marriage. \n\nThis might be a good time to talk about roles in the household and how to make it fair on both of you. \n\nBut in the meantime, fuck that shit.", "Why not just decides on days he cook and days you cook.. he can clean after him self and you can clean after your self .. that way no more fights and you both have rest days when other spouse is cooking .. why make big deal out of everything.\n\nMaybe you use more dish wear them him thats fine just clean it your self and he can clean the days he cooks", "That's the favorable outcome of this approach. I have had to take this approach and had a positive result too.\n\nNTA op", "NTA \u201cit\u2019s never just about the dishes\u201d something else is happening.  He\u2019s angry about something and it ain\u2019t dishes", "He sounds misogynistic", "NTA.  My husband will get into a rut from time to time and say I don\u2019t do enough.  I had it a few weeks ago and told him I was going to be him for the day.  I took the kids to school and played on my phone most of the day.  I only did what I wanted.  I did take out the trash and a couple other small things.  Husband had to do everything that I do including afternoon pick up which he hates.  He found out how much I actually do and has started helping more.  I would so do this with the dishes and cooking.", "NTA but instead of not cooking for him which would likely not improve your marriage how about compromise and both do you own dishes the nights you cook so you both get a full evening off kitchen duty?", "I stopped cooking for mine. He never reciprocated, never cleaned up afterwards, never appreciated what I made. Now I only cook for myself. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I know it\u2019s common to do the one person cooks, the other cleans, but I was trained to clean as I go, and not everyone was, and it sucks to clean up after someone who wasn\u2019t. My partner and I take turns, and the person who cooks, cleans.  Maybe you guys can try that.", "So much this. Being petty is no way to solve issues in a marriage.  Couples counseling is desperately needed to learn better communication and conflict resolution skills. \n\nESH he should help more and she should not be petty by only cooking for herself.  No longer cooking for him will only breed more resentment in the marriage.  The two of them need to sort it out like adults"]}
