{"id": 28882, "submission_id": "177nich", "title": "AITA for not letting my dad's wife be mother of the groom for my wedding?", "selftext": "I met my dad's wife when I (27M) was 16. She and my dad didn't move in together or get married until I moved out of the house. I was the baby and I have an older brother and sister. They never really got to know dad's wife all that much and only see her a handful of times while they call my dad all the time and see him occasionally. So I was the only one she really knew and she always thought I would look at her as some maternal figure in my life. But she was never family to me. She was my dad's and was accepted as such and I don't hate her, but I don't love her and we have disagreed over her involvement in mine and my siblings lives before.\n\nBoth of my siblings have children and I believe this is why my wedding has become such a big deal. She's not grandma to my nieces. She has only met one of them once and my dad has met them a few times but she was not involved.\n\nSo I think she sees my wedding as her last chance to get \"in\" enough so that she's considered family and a loved one and not just someone important to our dad. She was just a plus one at my siblings weddings. I want her to be the same at mine. She asked to take on the role of mother of the groom and to take part where my mom can't. Mom died when I was just a baby so I don't remember her but I grew up hearing all about her. It was always just the four of us (dad and my siblings).\n\nI told my dad's wife she could not be mother of the groom and she demanded to know why. She said she had been a parental figure since I was 16. I corrected her on that. She said after a decade I should love and care about her enough to make her more than just my dad's plus one. She suggested we do a mother/son dance at my wedding and perhaps I could list her and my dad as \"parents of the groom/mother and father of the groom\".\n\nShe told me I'm being unreasonable and she deserves more than she has gotten from me and from my siblings so far. Dad asked her to calm down and told her she had not been a parent to any of us and she should understand that her relationship with us will be different than if she had helped raise us. She said I was still being unreasonable and could do something for her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697283246, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177nich/aita_for_not_letting_my_dads_wife_be_mother_of/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I feel like I might be TA for that is because this clearly means a lot to her and I could give her something to make her feel wanted and appreciated.

Her demanding it just shows why she doesn't deserve the role of Mother of the Groom.", "Even your dad agrees she hasn't been a maternal figure to you, so she has no claim as mother of the groom", "NTA. You were out of the house before she was in it. She is merely your father's wife, and she doesn't have a family relationship with either you or your siblings. \n\nYour wedding is about you and your fiance, not a pageant with role playing. Let your dad continue to keep her in check, and plan your wedding as you want it.", "NTA you don't even live together in same house before . Why she thinks you will see her as mother when you don't give her any sign for that.", "NTA And I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dad\u2019s wife is so exhausting and overbearing. At leas that\u2019s how she comes off to me. It\u2019s ridiculous she thought she would come into your family and a 16 year old will just see her as his mom?\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0fshe most likely wanted kids and it never happened for whatever reasons so she saw you and your siblings as a perfect deal when she married your dad. She figured out the older kids don\u2019t want her as mom but you, your younger so she thought you would bond with her and then she would be mom. And she clearly knows you don\u2019t feel that way, maybe ask you dad to have an in depth conversation with all 3 of you to get to the root of this. Because you guys need to know why she\u2019s always pushed so hard with you and why she thinks she\u2019s owed the respect and love of title of mom when she didn\u2019t do the work of a mom. She raised no one, she didn\u2019t hold you when you got hurt and cried, she didn\u2019t help you when sick. She met you when you were out of the house basically, so she need to tell you guys why she thinks she deserves this part if your family when she\u2019s never done anything for you in that role ever. I hope it gets resolved and the rest of wedding planning goes smoothly. And congratulations on getting married!!! \ud83c\udf7e\ud83e\udd73 have an amazing wedding and enjoy the rest of your life with your best friend.", "NTA. Your wedding is not about her. You have a mom, and she isn't a replacement for your mom. If you allow her to centre herself in your wedding, eventually she'll be doing it at every major event in your and your siblings' lives. She's being incredibly selfish.", "NTA, and don\u2019t give in. She feels entitled when she\u2019s done very little to be in your life. Some people just like to feel important at events like weddings. If you allow her this, who knows what she\u2019ll ask for if y\u2019all have kids, or at family vacations, or any such thing. If she wanted this stuff, she had 11 years to earn it.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice.", "NTA. She\u2019s just your dad\u2019s wife. What Alarming Reply said about her being a VIP & her being listed as such with minimal work/effort from you. Give her a corsage/buttonhole that matches/compliments yours & your dads & grooms men( it\u2019s a cheap but nice touch which means nothing but will feel like you actually care/give her a acknowledgement but not really) . But then do nothing else- no role in your wedding. The only reason I recommend the above is for your dad actually- so he feels you wanted to make his wife feel nice. But it\u2019s your & your fianc\u00e9e day.", "NTA \n\nIt's for you to decide if you see her as a mother or not. She is allowed to feel sad about you not seeing her as a mother, but she can't demand this of you. Her asking is fine, but pushing after you declined is not.", "NTA\n\nYou absolutely could do something to include her more, if for no other reason than as a favor to your dad, because that could only make his life easier, but you certainly aren't an asshole for refusing. It's your wedding, and your life, and she can't demand to be part of it. She's really going about this in the wrong way, and I say this being the product of divorced parents who both remarried. My step parents mean/meant the world to me. My stepfather is one of the most important people in my life. Although he was with my mom for a bit when I was younger, they split, then got back together when I was 18, and married when I was around 20. But that's me. And my stepdad is awesome. Your stepmom sounds like a handful.", "NTA. It's your wedding therefore your decision so she has to respect that.", "NTA. And your dad agrees.", "NTA. It's your wedding and you've made it pretty clear that you don't view her as a parent. Her continuing to be pushy about it is only going to make it worse.", "NTA \n\nShe is absolute delusional\u2026. Her reaction/outburst is mind blowing\u2026", "NTAH Uninvite her. If your dad decides to not come because of her, that's fine. Just have your siblings. But don't bother with her.", "Ultimately, it's your wedding and you need to do what makes you happy. This is your special day and you need to base your decisions on what you want.\n\nIf she had no role in your upbringing, didn't move in with your father until after you moved out, and you're not remotely close, then I can completely understand why you don't want her taking on a mother of the groom role.\n\nOn the flip side, she is technically your step mother, so I can see why merely being your father's plus one bothers her.\n\nIs there any sort of minor role or duty she could play that would satisfy her but not be indicative of a mother of the groom role? You're not obligated to find a role but it might make life easier. If there's no role, so be it. As I said, this is your day. Be true to yourself and what makes you happy.", "Technically she\u2019s not a plus one. She\u2019s a VIP guest because she\u2019s your Dad\u2019s wife. That cannot be changed or ignored. She should be listed \u2014 Father of the Groom & stepmother. That\u2019s pretty standard in the industry.\n\nWhether or not you have a relationship with your stepmother has nothing to do with your wedding. Your vision for your wedding does not include your stepmother. That\u2019s fine. Lots of people don\u2019t include any \u201ctraditional\u201d parent participation in their wedding day.\n\nI\u2019m not certain why anyone needs/wants to add drama to their wedding. It\u2019s not necessary to drag up all past behaviors & feelings. Your wedding is not about your Dad or his wife that\u2019s all you have to say. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  You could do something for her.  She asked and you said no.  She\u2019s being an ass for pushing it", "OP, is she helping to pay for any part of your wedding?  If so you don't have to call her \"mother of the groom\", but you do have to make some effort to make her feel appreciated.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's no bond and she was never a parental figure in my life.", "I used the word stepmother because by definition that\u2019s what she is & I don\u2019t know her name. It was simply a word used as an example of where name would go. As an event planner I would call her by name but she would be identified as stepmother. \n\nNo one at a wedding is interested in intimate family drama. It\u2019s not the time nor place. No one will care what role the woman had in your life. She would still be a VIP guest because of your father & she should be recognized as such. Out of respect for your father. \n\nYou can call her whatever you want. That will not change that by definition she is married to your father so \u2026 she\u2019s your stepmother. I think you may be overthinking this. This is about your wedding day not your relationship with your father\u2019s wife. She does not need to be included in any part of your day however you should not be creating more problems by drawing attention to any conflicts. \n\nYou can have whatever relationship you want with her. Your wedding is not the place to be worrying about family issues. The best advice I can give you is to stop sharing information about your wedding with her.\n\nCongrats on your upcoming nuptials. Wish you all the best!"]}
