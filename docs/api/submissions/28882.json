She and my dad didn't move in together or get married until I moved out of the house. I was the baby and I have an older brother and sister. They never really got to know dad's wife all that much and only see her a handful of times while they call my dad all the time and see him occasionally. So I was the only one she really knew and she always thought I would look at her as some maternal figure in my life. But she was never family to me. She was my dad's and was accepted as such and I don't hate her, but I don't love her and we have disagreed over her involvement in mine and my siblings lives before.\n\nBoth of my siblings have children and I believe this is why my wedding has become such a big deal. She's not grandma to my nieces. She has only met one of them once and my dad has met them a few times but she was not involved.\n\nSo I think she sees my wedding as her last chance to get \"in\" enough so that she's considered family and a loved one and not just someone important to our dad. She was just a plus one at my siblings weddings. I want her to be the same at mine. She asked to take on the role of mother of the groom and to take part where my mom can't. Mom died when I was just a baby so I don't remember her but I grew up hearing all about her. It was always just the four of us (dad and my siblings).\n\nI told my dad's wife she could not be mother of the groom and she demanded to know why. She said she had been a parental figure since I was 16. I corrected her on that. She said after a decade I should love and care about her enough to make her more than just my dad's plus one. She suggested we do a mother/son dance at my wedding and perhaps I could list her and my dad as \"parents of the groom/mother and father of the groom\".\n\nShe told me I'm being unreasonable and she deserves more than she has gotten from me and from my siblings so far. Dad asked her to calm down and told her she had not been a parent to any of us and she should understand that her relationship with us will be different than if she had helped raise us. She said I was still being unreasonable and could do something for her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697283246, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177nich/aita_for_not_letting_my_dads_wife_be_mother_of/", "score": 1512, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And she clearly knows you don\u2019t feel that way, maybe ask you dad to have an in depth conversation with all 3 of you to get to the root of this. Because you guys need to know why she\u2019s always pushed so hard with you and why she thinks she\u2019s owed the respect and love of title of mom when she didn\u2019t do the work of a mom. She raised no one, she didn\u2019t hold you when you got hurt and cried, she didn\u2019t help you when sick. She met you when you were out of the house basically, so she need to tell you guys why she thinks she deserves this part if your family when she\u2019s never done anything for you in that role ever.

My step parents mean/meant the world to me. My stepfather is one of the most important people in my life.

I know my now adult children rely on my husband for advice and certain things before they would ever expect the same from their father.  The same for his children regarding me.  They have certain things they do with their real parents.  Told this because there are remarriages which are successful not only for the parents involved, but also for the children of the divorced and remarried parents.", "I haven\u2019t asked, but I\u2019m pretty sure my bonus kid likes me better than his biomom. But I never tried to force anything and my goal was just to be someone he considered a trusted adult. Him seeing me as a parent developed from there, partly due to me demonstrating that I could be trusted. Only person who might hate me is his biomom, and if she wants to hate me for being there for him when he needed someone when she wasn\u2019t, that\u2019s her problem.", "If she's having this much trouble letting those unrealistic expectations go after more than a decade, then she should probably go to counseling to work through her emotions. She's going about things the right way if she doesn't want to be a plus one anymore though.

Talk to your father about it.", "People who marry single parents in the hopes that it will drop an instant family into their laps are so funny.", "Okay, that explains it.", "Hmm. Well, you're not TA for your decision. Just because they're together doesn't mean they have to do everything equally. She's being irrational. Not sure if it's coming from a place of sadness (bc she wishes she were more enmeshed in the family) or a place of selfishness/ego (everything's got to be about her). Either way, your wedding's not the place to figure it out.\n\nBut I do hope the invites had her name with his, not just him plus one. That's how it would be written for any other married couple so it would have been unnecessarily unkind to omit her.\n\nCongrats on the wedding!", "What interests me more is the grandma role, and why she doesn't have it. She hasn't been a mother figure to OP or his siblings, but if their dad is grandpa, she could absolutely have a grandma-type role. But it looks like dad isn't all that involved as grandpa, and when he is, she isn't even present - is that her choice, or the kids' parents' choice?

That\u2019s how event planning works.", "Where would you \"list\" anyone as anything?", "I am not saying you have to include her in your wedding.  But after all these years none of you love her and make her feel like she is part of the family?  My God, you people suck.", "oh the point isn't to be persuasive or good, it's to try and inflict feelings of guilt and shame.

Logic has less to do with it than straight up emotional manipulation does.\n\nof course, it doesn't work on people with a spine and just looks/sounds like a tantrum. cuz it is one. but it's an attempt to manipulate, not persuade", "I think it might be.

I don't know for sure because I was invited last minute to a wedding on the absolute opposite side of the country, where they currently live. I have met her in person 1 time, 3.5 years ago. Yet, she insists on being Meemaw (or so other nonsense) to the grandkids and is constantly trying to repair a relationship my father ruined YEARS ago. She has even called my mom on me. I have made it clear that I am respectful to her because she is a human and married to my father but that I don't owe her anything and never will. Some women just don't get it.", "So weird!  I'm pretty old (late 50s) and my mom is dating a great guy.  I'm super happy for them both.  He has his kids and life and so does she.  We are all friendly and he is lovely to my mom.  That's it.

Bonus kid comes to me frequently to talk about stuff before he talks to either of his biological parents because somehow he turned out more like me than like either of them, go figure. So I\u2019m usually better at helping him put his thoughts in order because I tend to think in similar ways and can see where he might be going or what he might be getting at.

We don\u2019t have enough information to know why the siblings don\u2019t involve their dad in their lives or that they have an issue with him or his wife, perhaps they live far away. We only know that they were grown when their stepmother came into their lives and aren\u2019t attached to her. It\u2019d be understandable if they didn\u2019t include her in their weddings since they didn\u2019t have a relationship with her, but OP states that he\u2019s in regular contact with his dad and presumably her by association. It\u2019s gotta be gutting to think that she\u2019s built a relationship with her spouse\u2019s son only for OP to exclude her from being associated with his family. The siblings might not have a relationship with her but OP doesn\u2019t offer any insight into his relationship with her except that she\u2019s not his mom; we don\u2019t even know if he likes her or if there\u2019s been any drama.", "No. It doesn't.

Come on, the only person here that sucks is the step mom that cannot accept reality and is trying to manipulate her way into getting what she wants.

There is a point though that even people without spines pass through the guilt to get to the Plateau of Annoyance, so tantrums can backfire that way too.", "Which is exactly why we see so many similar situations on AITA!", "In fairness to her, anyone willing to marry my father had to be a few cards short of a full deck.", "It\u2019s weird.
