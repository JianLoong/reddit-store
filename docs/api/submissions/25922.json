Her unaccepting behavior started at 14. Since she was raised in an inclusive / non-judgemental household and had an angry / hostile reaction from the start, those are good indications that point to the all too familiar psychology of homophobia as a result of suppressed or even non-suppressed feelings.

You certainly don't owe her any kindness for treating you and your partner horribly.  However, there is a chance here for you to extend an olive branch, because if she **is** gay and really uncomfortable about it, you not accepting her ALSO as a member of the family could push back her coming out or just becoming more comfortable around the idea that gay people ARE,  JUST PEOPLE.  \n\nI'm just spitballing a wild take here, but:   I wonder if she may have confided in a friend as a child who was raised in a fundamentalist family and expressed abhorrence at your niece's confidence.  It may have happened several years ago before puberty.  Even at 8 or 9, kids know who they feel attracted to, if someone's presence gives them the giggles or butterflies, so she may not even remember the incident simply because she felt really rejected by a friend, even if the emotional and mental ramifications were not understood or noticed at the time.  \n\nAt any rate, I don't think you are an asshole for saying she can't stay, but I also can see how this could turn out to be something that can affect her personal journey and story in a profound way if you do consider it.

My world would\u2019ve come to a crashing halt.\n\nI don\u2019t know if they share some of her beliefs but cover it up around OP, or are just supremely lazy parents who didn\u2019t do the hard work and let their daughter turn into a bigoted asshole. Either way, they share culpability. If you tolerate the bigot, you\u2019re a bigot. SIL is a further asshole by leaning on the victim of her spawn\u2019s bigotry to just take it so she can keep thinking she didn\u2019t raise someone deserving of ostracism. His brother isn\u2019t stepping in either, which makes him an asshole along with her.", "Right! I don't want to be the fucking bigger person! I do not want that little bigot to be in my home! \n\nMake her get some therapy to find out why she thinks it's ok to act that way!

Niece is an incredibly entitled and a spoiled brat. NTA.", ">Your niece is simply being inconvenienced by her beliefs\n\nMy thoughts exactly. And that's all that it is for her. An inconvenience. She doesn't like staying with her friends, but she has other alternatives available to her - other friends (presumably she has other friends), other family members, or paying for a hotel herself or with help from her parents.  She's choosing to make her own life difficult because she choose to be hateful towards someone. If she wants to hold those beliefs, then she can also hold the consequences of those beliefs.\n\nI don't know about you, but I wouldn't be caught dead, asking for help from someone I hated. Not unless it was literal life or death. \n\nShe's not going to see it that way, in all likelihood, but that isn't OP's issue to deal with, either.", "I'd make it just the mum and daughter who get kicked out. Brother sounds like he supports op decision. It's also easier to kick just two people out than the entire family. If mum wants to side with the homophobe, mum gets tied to the consequences.", "Why don't you house her then and make her not homophobic?", "Allow someone who hates you to stay with you?  Yeah, no.  Not going to happen.\n\nIf this was something that happened years ago and the girl has been great ever since, that\u2019s one thing.

OP is not name calling, being hurtful or gloating. OP isn't returning the nieces behaviour. Instead, OP is teaching her not to treat them badly because there will be real world consequences. OP is expressing healthy behaviours. That is what family should do because strangers won't be as kind.", "Yeah indeed she had 6y for considering them family. But she didn\u2019t, so she did lose her position.", "The irony that if she had gone woke, she wouldn't have gone broke.  Lol", "I know this is completely off-topic, but I have to finally tell you something. Whenever I see your username crop up, it gives me a smile. I dearly loved Sir Terry's books.", "Ask the mother at what age she feels it would be appropriate for a bigot to start learning their actions have consequences.", "And tell her No is a complete sentence and unless she wants to join her daughter, to lay off.", "Remind her that she should be embarrassed her child behaved so awfully to someone who is family.", "even my 14 year old knows better than to act that way. because he's been TAUGHT better.", "I came to say the same. Not even complete homelessness would get me to even consider letting someone like her who treated me the way she has OP and his husband to live with me. I MAYBE would be willing to toss a cardboard box in their general direction if I was feeling generous.", "Yeah, because if she is homophobic, how bitter will she be that she is having to accept the help from someone of the lgbtq+ community? Would she openly mess with their house? Steal from them? How far does he hate go? I'm at least glad to see OP's brother isn't forcing the issue.", "Same here. No one should feel that level of blatant disgust and disrespect in their own home. Also when it comes down to it, she's just not entitled to access to your home regardless of the situation.", "NTA, One bad turn deserves another", "Yup cuz once she\u2019s in, she will make it a point to upset your entire life. \n\nNo thanks.

I keep wondering where the niece has learned this behavior.

I was watching season 2 of Good Omens last night and there was the BEST Discworld reference and I just went nuts over it.", "Yeah, honestly if she were still 14 I could write it off as a phase.

This kid should have had major consequences before now (like not being included in family gatherings if she couldn't be civil to both of her uncles and refrain from using slurs) and the fact that her mother is arguing that she shouldn't face consequences now is suspect.", "Exactly.

LOL, it was towards her parents.", "I mean I can't believe how casual they are about their child's homophobia.\n\nI fully support that kids need to be their own people and that isn't always gonna resonate in who you are or even your own values.\n\nBut, personally, I would NOT be this casual about my child growing up to openly be a bigot. Regardless of whether that is in the form of racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.\n\nShe showed these beliefs before she was even 14... Did anyone ever sit her down and in depth talk about how unacceptable it was for her to have these biggoted beliefs? OOP doesn't know where these beliefs came from... does ANYONE? Did anyone sit her down when she first started talking like this and ask her why she thinks/acts like this? Did anyone try to teach her better? How can your child suddenly start talking like this and you don't react in any way? Guys this is a code RED! You are raising a monster!\n\nWere there ever any real consequences for the bigoted things she said to/about her own uncle? I have a gay sibling and I would never let a child of mine treat them like that. Why were there never any REAL consequences for the way she acted? Not a chastisement. It's not like she let a casual curseword slip. The things she is saying openly is fucking hatespeech. And the whole family is accepting that as acceptable within the family by not reacting to it and tolerating that behaviour again and again. Why are they letting their familymember be treated this way?\n\nThe literal moment someone ever spoke to/about my family members in my house like this they would be OUT. Regardless of who it was. And if I were the guest I would be LEAVING.\n\nThe fact that this whole family has casually accepted that the niece just drops hatespeech every once in a while honestly speaks of the virtue of everyone present.\n\nYou are not a friend to any gay person in your life if you casually let people speak about them that way and don't see any TRULY serious issue with it. Not something that requires a mild scolding.", "It could be that she\u2019s learning it from friends/social media, and if all her parents do is chastise her then they\u2019re not really teaching her any differently.
