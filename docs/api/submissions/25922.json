To me, it seems like maybe she's terrified of homosexuality because her own sexuality terrifies her, she needn't be gay, but she could have more fluid sexual tendencies that for whatever reason, she finds disturbing.  Her unaccepting behavior started at 14. Since she was raised in an inclusive / non-judgemental household and had an angry / hostile reaction from the start, those are good indications that point to the all too familiar psychology of homophobia as a result of suppressed or even non-suppressed feelings.  The vehemence alone informs the psychological story here, not with 100% certainty, but the evidence points pretty squarely in that direction.  \n\nNTA and I understand you wanting to not feel disrespected in your own home.  You certainly don't owe her any kindness for treating you and your partner horribly.  However, there is a chance here for you to extend an olive branch, because if she **is** gay and really uncomfortable about it, you not accepting her ALSO as a member of the family could push back her coming out or just becoming more comfortable around the idea that gay people ARE,  JUST PEOPLE.  \n\nI'm just spitballing a wild take here, but:   I wonder if she may have confided in a friend as a child who was raised in a fundamentalist family and expressed abhorrence at your niece's confidence.  It may have happened several years ago before puberty.  Even at 8 or 9, kids know who they feel attracted to, if someone's presence gives them the giggles or butterflies, so she may not even remember the incident simply because she felt really rejected by a friend, even if the emotional and mental ramifications were not understood or noticed at the time.  \n\nAt any rate, I don't think you are an asshole for saying she can't stay, but I also can see how this could turn out to be something that can affect her personal journey and story in a profound way if you do consider it.
