Whenever someone says something that she can remotely latch onto she will derail the conversation for ten minutes and not stop. Everyone is obviously uncomfortable but is too nice to say anything so she keeps going. Sometimes when it got really bad the director would tell her stop but she had to talk over this woman to be heard. Today was our first dress rehearsal and we have a show on Friday. The stage manager was going over costumes and the woman had a question regarding hers. I don't remember what it was because I went from mentally preparing myself for the awkwardness as I do every time she speaks, to tolerating her rambling and suffering with everyone else. I do remember that it was totally unnecessary and she obviously should have saved it for afterwards. What pushed me over the edge to speak to her about it was the lady next to me who desperately whispered \"just... stop... talking\". So I went up to her afterwards and said hi, and she greeted me happily. I said that I was asking as respectfully as possible to talk a little less. The smile drained from her face and she stared through me for five seconds. I awkwardly asked her if my request was hurtful and she managed a \"y-yeah\" before going to a chair and crying. Later she pulled me aside and basically trauma dumped. She told me that I upset her because as a child she was excluded to the point of needing to eat from the trash because of her autism. She said that I had effectively told her to shut up. Which of course I didn't but I guess that's how she took it. She gave me a hug and said she wasn't upset at me.

One must be respectful, but it's not your job to know everyone's life story, especially if they choose to place themselves in social situations and then act inappropriately.", "NTA. I'm on the spectrum and I often talked too much and too loudly. I've had people tell me to be more quiet \ud83e\udd23 \n\nI'm not as bad now that I'm on meds and getting therapy. I don't trauma dump on random people as much either, it's nice to have a therapist.", "NAH, but the way you approached this was unproductive. You made her feel like an asshole, she probably feels silenced as well. And your comment didn't work because she came back to find you and explain herself, resulting in her talking even more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCommunication is a two way street. Come from an 'I' perspective, tell her what you're struggling with, in regard to her behavior, and then ask her for a solution. \"I am noticing that when mid rehearsal you have an off topic conversation, my focus on the rehearsal is lost. And I spoke to...and she has the same thing. Is there any way we can stay on topic during rehearsal?\" Might also be an opening for the future as it'll come from your needs when you say mid-group: \"Can we please get back to the rehearsal?\" It will feel like less of an attack and she won't feel the need to explain herself bc she's not being criticised.", "NTA. You signed up for a play, not as someone else\u2019s therapist/psychiatrist.

She sounds highly sensitive, which is understandable given her past trauma, but she can\u2019t put that on everyone around her. I hope she finds a good therapist or support system to work through these issues. It sounds like you were polite and respectful, OP, so don\u2019t feel any guilt.", "NTA. \n\nLook I\u2019ll say this much, virtually every spectrum friend I have (myself included) over analyzes our social interactions. Yes I know, a lot of people not on the spectrum do that too, but it\u2019s not exactly the same when you\u2019re fully cognizant of the fact that you don\u2019t read social situations the same as neurotypical people. You know you\u2019re different, you\u2019ve been told you\u2019re weird your entire life. \n\nAnd we have a term for what likely occurred here: rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD).

Im glad you took the time after to sit with her, and I\u2019m sorry you felt weird about her trauma dumping, but it sounds like you sincerely tried to be polite about letting her know she\u2019s talking too much, and that you followed up to ensure it didn\u2019t hit her too hard. No matter how she takes it after that, it\u2019s the most any of us could hope for. You did the right thing here.", "The best thing for you to do for this person is to be polite and kind but HONEST. \n\nI have adhd and it's like having social broccoli in my teeth. If no one in my life tells me when I have broccoli or showed me for to use a mirror I'd never have learned how to fix it. \n\nIt is unfortunate she hasn't learned these skills but you need to let her know hey I'm busy I can't talk this long.\n\nDon't bring all the stuff in it from this post, that could end up in bullying quick. Just stick to the point; thank you for sharing but I can't talk for this long. \n\nHer response unfortunately is because she knows she's weird and is pushing people away, but unfortunately if no one says anything and just mutters under their breath not only do you waste your time on this but so does she. \n\nNah slightly leaning to her being ah as she should know better, but as she clearly does not please advocate for yourself in these conversations with kindness. Please realize that this is also going to help her to learn what is appropriate. Don't be mean to her to her or behind her back, but make it clear you can't talk this much.", "NTA.  I say this as an autistic woman with ADHD.  I tend to ramble and overexplain things.  I\u2019ve seen people visibly get annoyed with me or ask me to speak slower.  It sounds like you expressed how you were feeling calmly and respectfully, and tried not to hurt her feelings. \nAutistic people do have different needs than most, but it\u2019s okay to politely give them feedback and constructive criticism if appropriate, just like neurotypical people.", "NTA\nIt needed doing and you did it politely.\nWhy do people need to off load their \u201ctrauma\u201d guilt on others?", "NTA You handled the awkwardness really well. \n\nI was unfortunately in a similar situation where I \u201ctriggered\u201d someone because I looked/sounded like their mother-in-law. There wasn\u2019t any action I could take and I wasn\u2019t apologizing for my face so\u2026.\n\nI see it as the same thing, you asked as her behavior impacted you. Her response was completely out of your control. Also there was a lot of hugging\u2026 you good with that? \n\nI would reminder her about the talk the next time you are together with maybe something along the lines of \u201clet\u2019s leave space for other to speak as well\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s stay on the time set\u201d & good for you for voicing your needs as that is really hard sometimes.", "NTA. I think you did great communicating to someone with that kind of mental disorder about her social awkwardness. I know they didn\u2019t take it well but that doesn\u2019t excuse the behavior and how it impacts others around them. People with Asperger\u2019s are highly intelligent so by telling them that, they will look at how they are acting and will actively try to correct the behavior.\n\nJust don\u2019t get angry and use a friendly tone of voice and they will come around.", "YTA. There was plenty of better ways to phrase that. It can be really hard to navigate and while that\u2019s not your problem nor your fault you doubt need to make it worse by being rude regardless of their issues. Adhd and Aspergers aside you should never react to someone like that. I understand wanting her to be quiet but she will never forget that comment regardless of how tame. I don\u2019t think you are wrong in your comments about the trauma dumping however very uncomfortable and not ok on her end.", "Very gentle YTA. What did you think you would achieve by doing this? You stated the directed had mentioned it at least once. So, what did you think you would achieve that they didn't? It's also not your responsibility to address this. \n\nAnd to add on, people who talk very excessively often can't control it. Whether for a mental issue or something else. It's not as simple as as \"just stop talking.\" And as a neurodivergent person, I promise most of us know we talk \"a lot.\"", "YTA. \n\nYou value the whispering person and others over the person with special needs. \n\nPatience and accepting differences is something we all need to practice. \n\nYou annoy the crap outta me, but I'm not asking you to delete your post. \n\nThe director can handle running the rehearsal.", "as someone with ADHD slight YTA. you could have changed your wording from \"talk less\" and explained that for everyones comfort she could be a little quieter. neurodivergent people can a lot of the time not have a strong grasp of social cues. but literally explaining to them what theyre doing and how its affecting those around them usually makes them understand. its just stupid to tell a person with ADHD to just talk less. because you can easily do that, for her its a struggle. its like telling a dog to stop running around acting over the top, they cant help it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's 2023. \n\nOP was not wrong to say something, but they were wrong to just start off with \"talk less please\" to someone who likely had no idea they were monopolizing conversations. Others have given good suggestions for what would have been a more polite way to broach the topic. Bottling up resentment at someone for something they don't know is causing a problem and then suddenly addressing it in a rude way with no warning to them is not good communication or okay behavior regardless of their neurotype. \n\nBut what OP said is miles less offensive than this.
