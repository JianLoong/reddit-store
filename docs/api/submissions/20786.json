So I went up to her afterwards and said hi, and she greeted me happily. I said that I was asking as respectfully as possible to talk a little less. The smile drained from her face and she stared through me for five seconds. I awkwardly asked her if my request was hurtful and she managed a \"y-yeah\" before going to a chair and crying. Later she pulled me aside and basically trauma dumped. She told me that I upset her because as a child she was excluded to the point of needing to eat from the trash because of her autism. She said that I had effectively told her to shut up. Which of course I didn't but I guess that's how she took it. She gave me a hug and said she wasn't upset at me.

And the only subject ever was them. I was pretty heavily pregnant and at some point ended up snapping at her for once again waking us up without a reason after a scrappy night's sleep. I only told her to let us sleep, but I still sometimes feel bad about it. But seriously, I don't say this lightly, but I honestly feel triggered every time I remember that week.

It is hard enough on a daily basis with just the ADHD, but to add ASD (which is what it should be referred to) can make a hard life, even harder. ADHD comes with all sorts of co-morbidities, like RSD which can very often lead to a very strong emotional reaction to perceived rejection, and conflict, as she displayed.\n\nWatch some stuff on YouTube, How To ADHD is a fantastic resource and I urge everyone to watch Jess's videos. ADHD is a very well-known condition that is hard to diagnose and unfortunately, many of us women with it fly under the radar. This leads to greater difficulty in social conditions and the ASD amplifies the difficulty in reading social cues. She may have thought that she was empathizing with you, or bonding with you through similarly shared experiences.\n\nI'll still say NTA, but hopefully with some education and compassion from you, you won't be TA for long.", "NTA.

I can guarantee she didn\u2019t mean to trauma dump, but we have a tendency to not have great filters for what others see as appropriate sharing- it can be all or nothing, especially when rejection sensitivity comes in to play (which I see heavily here), which can make us defensive and need to explain ourselves- which at that point ends up excruciatingly detailed- and usually even more awkward than usual.  \n\nYou did her a favor by mentioning it to her, but it can still be difficult to process emotionally- it\u2019s rough when it feels everyone else has a rule book they\u2019ve hidden from you (from some research it may be more difficult for NTs in predominantly autist/ND spaces).  If you are up for it maybe let her know appropriate times to talk by asking her questions then and even reminding her gently when it\u2019s time to be quiet (adhd means she\u2019s going to forget or have issues with impulse control- it\u2019s not intentional or about will power).  I\u2019ve found if you model for other people gentle redirection methods it can help her and allow other people to know how to intervene.  Especially for AuDHD teens (though I\u2019ve used it and had it used on me) I find that an acknowledgment then redirection seems to work best (if I can stay on task, lol).

Yes we may have this disorder but it\u2019s not what defines us it\u2019s how we define it. You can let it affect you or you can use it to your advantage. As I\u2019ve said before having the disorder doesn\u2019t define you it\u2019s what you do with it  that defines you.", "I disagree. Someone who can\u2019t read social cues can understand \u201cplease talk less\u201d much easier than 10 minutes of beating around the bush trying to be polite, but still boiling down to \u201cplease talk less\u201d. Considering OP stuck around even though it was awkward, and took the time to listen, it sounds like OP tried to be as respectful as possible. No matter how you frame it, 90% of the time there\u2019s no way to frame \u201cplease talk less\u201d in a way that isn\u2019t gonna cause hurt.", "That is so true, I've had the same problem with a good friend who is a big talker... just \"talk less\" is not helpfull", "What did she think it would achieve? She hoped that the person would stop droning on ruining the entire rehearsal for everyone else. If she isn't listening to the director then she clearly needs to hear it again. She also needs to work on her coping methods. The idea that everyone should just sit back and listen to her drone on because she is neuro divergent isn't helpful. If she needs accommodation (breaks, subtle cues as to when she needs to stop talking etc) then the onus is on her to communicate these needs.", "What the lady did is the textbook definition of trauma dumping.", "I dont think its impolite. Its a simple neutral and direct question. its not op\u2019s fault that it triggered her.", "The obligation to be polite to someone ends when they are also not being polite.", "This exactly, naming the behaviour and how it affects other people is way more helpful than just telling her to shut up, even if you say it politely", "If someone didn't get it the first time, they're not going to get it the second time. And again, it wasn't OP's place to correct this behavior. It's the director's.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying but it\u2019s not a choice and so it\u2019s not quite as super as manners. It can be extremely difficult to suppress and control symptoms and while I don\u2019t think that\u2019s everyone else\u2019s issue to deal with or solve I do believe she deserves some understanding. I don\u2019t think her trauma dumping was ok and I understand where op is coming from there was just a better way to phrase the feedback.", "Maybe they think only the director is bothered by it. Saying something confirms it is an issue."]}
