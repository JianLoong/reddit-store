This is our first baby and we're excited. Thing is he barely attends any dr appointments with me and his excuses aren't even valid. He's willing to miss the dr appointment over soccer or a drink or board game with friends. His response is always \"I'm not the one carrying the baby, why do I have to go see the dr with you?\".\n\n\nLast week was my final straw. He was supposed to come with me for the baby's gender reveal appointment but he chose to not come last minute because his friend invited him to fish 'n' chips meal. I was pretty livid but didn't make a fuss about it. Mom went with me instead.\n\n\n\nHe texted asking me to tell him the results (boy or girl) but I refused to tell him. He kept spam calling me but I hung up each time. He came home fuming demanding I tell him the results but I refused and bluntly told him, since he refused to attend the appointment then he gets no results til after the baby's born and said I was wiling to die on this hill. He went off calling me spiteful and immature for doing this and punishing him. He said he's the father and has the right to know. He then called me dramatic since I wasn't alone and mom was with me. I said he gets no results period.\n\n\nHe's been fuming about it and told his family and they're now pressuring me to stop playing mind games with him and tell him but I declined.\n\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: Hi, so, first of all, wow!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Sorry, can't answer any comments because of feeling overwhelmed...um I just wanted to mention that my husband just attempted to contact my dr to get the results. It didn't go well and we had another argument over it. He couldn't get it since his mom was the one who made the call.", "created_utc": 1672679959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101hya0/aita_for_refusing_to_tell_my_husband_the_gender/", "score": 10983, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And also I really do wish that people (partners, family of both parties, extended friend groups etc) realised one very important thing about these scans: Finding out the gender (if you want to know) is a happy bonus. It is NOT the point of the actual scan.\n\nThe point of the scan is to find out if the baby is healthy and growing well! It's to confirm they have a heartbeat, that they have the appropriate limbs and organs, that their skull has grown over the brain, that there are no signs of a serious medical condition that is incompatible with life, and that there's nothing wrong with the placenta or anything that could cost you YOUR life.\n\nEvery day people go into these scans and get the worst news possible. And so many people dismiss that aspect because they're focused on what genitals the baby has. \n\nMaybe instead of focusing on what the baby has between their legs, your partner should be grateful that he didn't get a phonecall from you sobbing in a waiting room going \"There's something terribly wrong\".

I don't see this bloke changing diapers or getting up during the night.\n\nNot sure she'll be able to change him but start with maintaining this as a hill to die on.", "I cannot imagine having to drive myself in for an appointment that important and say \"uh, it's just me today\" knowing the absolutely dumbass reason the father \"couldn't attend\"", "Yes - it downplays the importance of the scan itself.", "That\u2019s when we learned about my baby\u2019s fatal heart defect. It was awful as it was- would have been so much worse without my husband.", "I never heard of it called gender reveal scan, but we never found out the gender, so maybe that\u2019s why I never thought of it that way. \nIt was the 20 week anatomy scan. And both times there were slight issues that needed to be looked at further. The first one I was low key freaking out with my husband by my side as the doctor spoke to us. Everything was fine, and we had the same issue with my second pregnancy so I wasn\u2019t as worried, but still would want my husband there. \nHow selfish and uninvolved to not be there for something that could be so exciting or scary.", "I feel the same. Everyone kept talking about finding out the sex of the baby before mine and all I wanted to know was the health. It\u2019s not the main part!", "20 years ago I had this scan done and found out my baby had a rare fatal bone disease ( perinatal hypophosphatasia). I wasn\u2019t alone but having to switch to the high risk unit at a major Toronto hospital, genetic scans, and all of that is difficult. You need your partner there.  This appointment is critical.", "I\u2019m so sorry that this happened, it was so difficult during the worst of COVID.", "I\u2019m so sorry.", "He's \"excited\" for the rights and privileges that, in his mind, come with being a father. Take the kids to the park, build a swingset when he has the time, help coach the soccer team, post lots of pictures of his kid on social media and collect the social clout that comes with being a dad, a family man . . . and, possibly, having undisputed power over a small human at home. What he has zero interest in is the *responsibilities* of parenthood, or being a partner to his wife.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if he refused to help with night feedings, diapers, mealtimes, bath time, bedtime, taking care of the kid when they're sick or taking them to doctors appointments, school pickup or dropoff, shopping for Christmas presents, or carpooling to activities he's not interested in like ballet or cheerleading - that'll all be \"her job,\" and if she ever leaves him, that's when he goes on every social media platform to complain about how horrible she is for not letting him see his kid - \"I'M THE FATHER! I HAVE RIGHTS! LET ME BE A *FATHER!\"*", "There\u2019s no such thing as emergency surgery at your 20 week appointment. It\u2019s more like \u201cyour baby might have downs or is missing a limb or worst case, has anencephaly and won\u2019t survive\u201d. It can be really devastating is the point and is one of if not the most important appointments.", ">>Which makes him 100% the AH\n\nI agree with everything you\u2019re saying; just wanted to point out that your verdict won\u2019t count as written - it needs to state \u201cNTA\u201d or one of the other three-letter strings the bot looks for", "My dad used to take my brother to soccer practices and games, but never once took me out on my own because he didn\u2019t know what to do with a girl. \n\nLuckily he\u2019s come around and will do anything to spend time with me as an adult. He also wants to spend as much time with my kids as possible, even babysitting them.", ":hugs back: \n\nWe are both so much better off.", "Exactly!!! Big sacrifices for him!\n\nOn a different note, i feel bad for OP as she is a pregnant woman, a soon to be mother who needs all the care and support her partner can provide. Stay strong OP \u2764\ufe0f", "My son is born of my egg and sperm donor. He\u2019s now a healthy 14 year old.  I\u2019m grateful to this anonymous person for helping me have my son.", "I, too, have 2 kids with a deadbeat. Being a single mom with 2 kids is way easier than it was being a married mom with 3 kids. Pretty sure if I stayed, my kids would be prison bound by the time they reach adulthood.", "Also if they split custody, even if the deadbeat has to only watch the kid every other weekend, the deadbeat is FORCED to do basic parenting *if he wants any hope of retaining custody*. Can't just dump the kid on Mommy every time you want to do party with your friends. For two days every two weeks YOU have to provide for your child's needs.\n\nOr they just peace out and in the end it's a win-win for the parent and kid cuz at least you don't have to deal with this deadbeat anymore.", "I support that lol, but I anticipate it will just make someone this immature to begin with\u2019s emotional and mental state spiral into further immaturity and coping skills to match, I\u2019d hate to bet on the beginning of the end tho, i dont know them", "I too support her hill! \nIt\u2019s not like it was a no miss opp. Come on now, bruh. \n\nNTA", "And all this guy cares about is the sex. Not if the baby is healthy or if there are any issues, or even how OP is doing. He's butthurt because she won't tell him  what genitals the baby has.", "Yep. You can find out the gender a million ways, I found out through NIPT and an emergency scan, where baby laid it all out, they gave me the news to soothe my bawling ass who was absolutely panicking. It was well known I wanted to know. They asked at my first appointment if I planned on knowing and EVERYONE has access to those wishes. So it couldn\u2019t have angered me. \n\nMy anatomy scan isn\u2019t even going to reveal the gender. It\u2019s been revealed. They do it if you want to know or not.", "That would be my thought.  OP, you're not going to get any help from him.  Not with anything that matters anyway, like the night feedings in the beginning or the hard pre-teen and teen stuff.  Prepare yourself for that, whether or not you remain with him.  To be honest, be ready for him to bail at the birth too, because it's uncomfortable for him, and he's not the one who has to go through the childbirth.\n\nNot to mention somethingkooky's point that you never know if you're going to get not-so-great news.  For that reason alone, the other parent should also always be there if at all possible.  Mom/Grandma being there is great, but it's just not the same as the other parent.", "God I couldn't imagine being a mother going through that appointment alone if everything was fine. I'd be stresses as hell. Thank for correcting I'm honestly to terrified of pregnancy to do research about those appointments (until the day I have too).", "Cum bum", "'One and Done' dad", "Good. Let him. Better to get his honest self out in the open right now. Better to know he\u2019s a deadbeat now after a decade of miserable marriage. \n\nHow he handles this really easy stuff right now is an excellent forewarning for how he\u2019ll be after the baby is born. This is only a bump in the road. She needs to know how his emotional suspension will handle before they get utterly totaled down the line.", "I think it's planned. He and his friends just *conveniently* have plans during every dr appointment? Not possible. Maybe a couple of times it would be a coincidence, but having it happen during every single appointment is deloberate. They're doing it on purpose.", "Maybe but maybe not.   Easily could've just been like \"yo u wanna grab a drink?\" And his response is \"yeah let's do it.\". With the friends being unaware of how often he's blowing off appointments.", "My friend does these scans.  \n\nShe said Covid was hell - only the pregnant mother was allowed in these appointments (in the UK) as a precaution.  So many times she had to tell pregnant mothers that there were problems with their unborn babies, and they had no support.  She was left trying to console distraught ladies, while not able to hug/touch them either, and with another patient sat waiting.\n\nI can't imagine trying to drive yourself home in those circumstances.", "Probably how long he lasts too\u2026", "Don\u2019t these people work?", "Kind thoughts to your friend! That sounds awful.\n\nThankfully, over here, even during covid the other parent could still come to the scans and appointments. And our baby was healthy and perfect. My husband was with me for every single appointment. OP, that's the standard your partner should be held to."]}
