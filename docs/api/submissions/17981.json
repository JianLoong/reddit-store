It was a large gathering. Both SIL and BIL brought their dogs (x3). I didn't really want the dogs here but at the same time, I kind of just sucked it up because we were going to be outdoors anyways. \n\nAnyways, SILs dogs are extremely high energy and food driven. Ones a giant Rottie and the other is some sort of Russian Chihuahua (I think that's what she said)- so small lap dog. BILs dog is fine. He is old and just kind of lays around looking for pettings (black lab). So we start dishing out plates or whatever and my SIL is just waiting and staring at us but not saying anything. When we get everyone's food she goes \"Uhm, where's their food?\" And points down at her two dogs, who are standing by the grill begging. I told her that I'm not feeding her dogs food that cost me over $300. I purchased this food on my dime and I'm not going to see it go to a dog, when other people could want more food. She said something to the affect of \"well what the hell are they supposed to eat then? They eat with us for every meal and now they are just going to be sitting here thinking they did something wrong because you won't feed them.\" So I responded with \"with all due respect, that is not my problem. You should have figured something out instead of expecting us to feed your dogs steaks and burgers.\" \n\nAnyways, she ended up putting her food on the ground for her dogs and sat with her arms crossed the whole time, glaring at everyone around her while they were eating; saying \"That sure looks yummy. Good thing the rest of the family gets to eat.\" My husband kept coming up and saying \"just give her a plate hun, she's causing drama\" and I refused. She gave her plate to her dogs, who shouldn't have been fed the food I purchased anyhow because I clearly said no already, and I'm not going to give in to the entitlement when she didn't do anything to contribute. If I allowed her to walk all over us this time than it would happen over and over in the future. MIL and FIL are on my side, as apparently she pulls the same shit at their house.

Who gives dogs hamburgers?  That's pretty upsetting to see they just feed them human food.  \n\nI wouldn't let this drop.  Don't let her do that with your food.  Dogs need dog food, that's formulated as a complete diet.  If you're going to prepare food, it needs to be specifically for dogs and most likely raw.\n\nShe's an animal abuser whose knowingly making her dogs sick.  \n\nI can't imagine how poorly behaved they ate, if they are being fed at the table like that.", "...why didn't she bring dog food?

I hate these self-righteous entitled jerks like your SIL.\n\nTo me the issue goes beyond simply not feeding the animals expensive food: they invited 3 more sentient beings without asking your permission or letting you know beforehand to plan accordingly for a meal you were inviting them to.\n\nAnd her little tantrum was pathetic. Good call on not giving her anything else.", ">Both SIL and BIL brought their dogs (x3). I didn't really want the dogs here but at the same time, I kind of just sucked it up because we were going to be outdoors anyways.\n\nThat was your only mistake. You should have said no to them bringing the dogs if you didn't want dogs there.\n\nThat said, if SIL and BIL expected you to feed their dogs, they needed to say that in advance so you could account for their needs. Apparently, SIL is a \"doggy mommy\" who expects everyone to treat her dogs the way they would human children but lacks the courtesy to ask rather than assuming.\n\nIf SIL and BIL have enough disposable income to feed their dogs people food and are okay with mistreating their dogs that way, that's their prerogative. But so is the burden of making sure they have food to eat. Taking them to a bbq where steak is being served without having 1) asked if it's okay to bring them and 2) asked if you're aware they will need to be fed was a combination of AH moves on their part.\n\n>MIL and FIL are on my side, as apparently she pulls the same shit at their house.\n\nHow did no one think to mention this to you in advance?\n\nYou are NTA.

More importantly you clearly set your boundary that only she got a plate, and she gifted it to the dogs.

I am gonna assume no... but if it is not a thing why would she expect food for the dogs?

That is truly irresponsible dog ownership and those dogs\u2019 tummies must be so uncomfortable all the time.", "Not one but 3 uninvited dogs at a BBQ that she didn't even chip in. I never would have let her stay. That's absolutely ridiculous of her and her husband. Did they bring the rest of their house with them as well? The entitlement of some people is just wild. NTA and I'm glad you stood your ground.", "NTA! I'm cracking up thinking about this image in my head\ud83d\ude02. So did the BIL offer to share his food with his wife? Entitlement is running rapid these days. Glad you stood your ground. I'd make sure to remind her next time to bring their dog's food with them!", "NTA Jesus some people.", "NTA, also I assume you provided food other than meat so I'm wondering why she just sat there and didn't eat a bread roll or something", "NTA, you bring your dogs, you bring food for them.", "NTA. I have two dogs, one that is very food driven, and I would NEVER assume that people would cook meals for me and my pups. You are not obligated to feed someone else's pets and your SIL chose to give  the food she was served food to her dogs. I wouldn't  have given her a second plate either.", "NTA. Your SIL is out of her mind expecting other people to feed her dogs.", "NTA \n\nI think most of us here are damn proud of your shiny spine tbh.

And if someone told me the dog was welcome, I'd bring food for her and treats, I certainly wouldn't demand a plate of food for my dog from the hosts.", "NTA I love dogs but feeding them is down to their owners you don't bring a pet to a bbq that you contributed nothing to and demand things bring your own meat if u want to do that don't expect others to give up food they paid for lol", "NTA\n\nShe expected you to plate food for her dogs and when you didn't she thought she'd shame/force you to give her another plate.

I literally do not understand why SIL isn't embarrassed.", "You are so NTA! You did feed SIL and she could have had the food that looked so yummy. She chose to give it away, that\u2019s on her not you. \n\nBIL was smart enough to bring food for his dog and she should have too. \n\nAlso it sounds like she feeds her dogs human food every night which I can\u2019t imagine is very healthy for them. I love the idea of stocking a small amount of dog food to give her when she pulls this bull crap. And this comes from someone who, when having a big bbq at my home, used to make an unseasoned burger for my dog so he got a treat too. But that was my choice at my house with my groceries. \n\nDefinitely do not let her win this one, someone needs to enforce boundaries with her.", "NTA \n\nIf there's ever a repeat of this instance I'd be petty AF and give my respectful BIL's well behaved pooch some table scraps.", "SIL is going to make her dogs seriously ill, if not actually kill them one day. There\u2019s all sorts of ingredients in human food that can make dogs sick and even kill them. Not only is she an entitled ass, she\u2019s also a neglectful and moronic ass. You\u2019re definitely NTA, OP!", "Does BIL think you were unreasonable?", "Wait, do they not live together? They should treat their dogs as eachothers if they are family. Why would SIL not be mad at BIL for bringing food for only one dog?

It's what I do, before I sit down to eat I just feed my dog his food and if I have any veggies or meat he can have it goes into his bowl after I eat. Dogs can get all sorts of issues from eating seasoned meats.", "Sounds so limiting. You can't feed dogs onions, garlic, chives, chocolate, avocado, grapes, so much stuff that it's just not worth the risk. Either she's quit making food with garlic or onions in, or she's slowly poisoning her dogs. Rough", "If that's what they're doing, they're really bad dog owners because it's not good for dogs to do that....  I have a lot of friends with dogs who have brought them to BBQs at my place - none of them were feeding their dogs \"person food\" and had brought food for their dogs.  (Of course, things dropped on the ground were fair game ... many people bring kids as well and so the combo does result in some dogs getting person food.)", "Can you post an update when her dogs are either really fat or have pancreatitis? I love my dog. He eats things, in moderation, that he probably shouldn't. He would never get a plate of BBQ.", "That's really bad for the dogs. It's one thing to give a dog some bones as a treat at a BBQ. That's the most I've seen. That's after the meat has been eaten off by humans.\n\nBut they absolutely shouldn't be eating the same food as humans. Dogs have different dietary needs than us. A lot of the food we eat is poisonous to them as well.", "She's legit killing her dogs...", "Did the BIL & SIL say they were bringing their dogs?  BIL at least brought his own dog food.

That\u2019s just wasting food and money.", "That's even worse.", "Yeah same. I give my dog pet safe human food but it\u2019s at my house under my roof. Therefore my choice. It\u2019s so rude to take whole plates SOMEBODY ELSE PREPARED and give it away like that. \n\nSIL just needs to have some pre-packed food (could even be some plain chicken) for the dogs to indulge on when everyone eats their food. It\u2019s seriously not that hard to figure out.", "The high energy food motivated dogs in this story sure as hell would", "Seasonings like onions and garlic can be toxic to animals. Xyitol fake sweetener will kill your dog with a 1/2 piece of gum. Raisins and grapes are another dangerous one. Raisins are used in bbq or other sauces as sweetener, as is fake sugars. I have raised 2 wolf crosses and other large breed dogs. If you give them people food of any kind: It's in their food bowl, NOT when you are eating. No seasonings. I feed my dogs after I eat. If you don't establish you are  the pack leader and enforce pack rules,  dogs can become problems very quickly. The other commenter had perfect answer..big ole' side dish of dog kibble bowl. Maybe with some shredded carrots and beets to make it special and let her decide whom is getting BBQ and whom gets kibble. I'm willing to chip in $25 to see it on video..", "Exactly! These poor dogs are really primed for a serious case of pancreatitis and early death. \n\nOP, NTA. Your SIL has an odd brand of entitlement.

I'm shocked it isn't dead already since it only has to eat a fraction of the poisonous foods that the rottie would need in order to get sick", "I'll bet she's slowly poisoning her dogs. If she feeds the dogs whatever the humans are eating, but didn't give OP a heads up, she isn't paying enough attention to what the dogs can and can't eat. It's pretty common to season burger patties and steaks with either garlic or onion.", "With the attitude she gave OP, she's absolutely poisoning those dogs slowly. Even BBQ food is absolutely awful for dogs. It doesn't sound like she gives her does kibble ever. I'm shocked there isn't more dog diarrhea in this story, honestly", "Uh, no?\n\nNo reasonable pet owner would expect somebody else to procure pet food for their pets. If my dog comes somewhere with us and we will be there at his meal time, we bring his food. Shit we bring a water bowl with us anywhere we take him. I don't expect anybody to offer up a dish for him to drink from. This is pet ownership 101. The SiL in this story is beyond ridiculous. \n\nOP NTA, not even close. Good for you for standing your ground. Also, the comment made above about having a serving of dog food ready to serve SiL the next time she gives your food to her dogs is hilarious. We could then say Y T A, but a damn funny one!", "Asking to bring your pet should have been on the SIL, she didn\u2019t even ask for permission to bring the dogs in the first place. Also sounds like OP would have preferred she didn\u2019t at all. Bringing food to feed your dog is also on the dog owner because a responsible dog owner doesn\u2019t give their dogs exclusively human food.", "I love dogs but people need to stop bringing them EVERYWHERE. A backyard BBQ with permission? Sure. An indoor mall in a stroller? Fuck off.", "I give my dogs hamburgers once in awhile if I\u2019m grilling. But only the meat, no bun, no cheese and no condiments. It\u2019s not terrible for them if it\u2019s done once in awhile. It does have a high fat content so again it shouldn\u2019t be an everyday thing. My dogs are small so they usually split one anyways.", "You\u2019re putting them at risk of pancreatitis", "I don\u2019t tend to believe much I read on Reddit. This story is more of a believable one though. Not saying it\u2019s real, also can\u2019t count it out.

Our dog accidentally got ahold of paper towels soaked in prime rib juice and got really sick with pancreatitis. It was scary, but he\u2019s okay.", "Yeah 100 percent. I had a dog that had hard dietary requirements so I cooked for him, but you have to be so careful. I never give my dogs people food, and even as a treat they only occasionally get some banana or apple. To expect other people to give or even feel comfortable giving them human cooked food is wild.

That's the only way to handle these kind of people sometimes. I'd hate to married to her.", "I\u2019m guessing iron stomachs at this point.
