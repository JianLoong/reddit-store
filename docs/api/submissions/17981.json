It was a large gathering. Both SIL and BIL brought their dogs (x3). I didn't really want the dogs here but at the same time, I kind of just sucked it up because we were going to be outdoors anyways. \n\nAnyways, SILs dogs are extremely high energy and food driven. Ones a giant Rottie and the other is some sort of Russian Chihuahua (I think that's what she said)- so small lap dog. BILs dog is fine. He is old and just kind of lays around looking for pettings (black lab). So we start dishing out plates or whatever and my SIL is just waiting and staring at us but not saying anything. When we get everyone's food she goes \"Uhm, where's their food?\" And points down at her two dogs, who are standing by the grill begging. I told her that I'm not feeding her dogs food that cost me over $300. I purchased this food on my dime and I'm not going to see it go to a dog, when other people could want more food. She said something to the affect of \"well what the hell are they supposed to eat then? They eat with us for every meal and now they are just going to be sitting here thinking they did something wrong because you won't feed them.\" So I responded with \"with all due respect, that is not my problem. You should have figured something out instead of expecting us to feed your dogs steaks and burgers.\" \n\nAnyways, she ended up putting her food on the ground for her dogs and sat with her arms crossed the whole time, glaring at everyone around her while they were eating; saying \"That sure looks yummy. Good thing the rest of the family gets to eat.\" My husband kept coming up and saying \"just give her a plate hun, she's causing drama\" and I refused. She gave her plate to her dogs, who shouldn't have been fed the food I purchased anyhow because I clearly said no already, and I'm not going to give in to the entitlement when she didn't do anything to contribute. If I allowed her to walk all over us this time than it would happen over and over in the future. MIL and FIL are on my side, as apparently she pulls the same shit at their house.

I am a dog lover, and I know damn well you don't give the food you serve to people to dogs, which is very rude and inappropriate.

That's pretty upsetting to see they just feed them human food.  \n\nI wouldn't let this drop.  Don't let her do that with your food.  Dogs need dog food, that's formulated as a complete diet.  If you're going to prepare food, it needs to be specifically for dogs and most likely raw.\n\nShe's an animal abuser whose knowingly making her dogs sick.  \n\nI can't imagine how poorly behaved they ate, if they are being fed at the table like that.", "...why didn't she bring dog food?

I hate these self-righteous entitled jerks like your SIL.\n\nTo me the issue goes beyond simply not feeding the animals expensive food: they invited 3 more sentient beings without asking your permission or letting you know beforehand to plan accordingly for a meal you were inviting them to.\n\nAnd her little tantrum was pathetic. Good call on not giving her anything else.", ">Both SIL and BIL brought their dogs (x3). I didn't really want the dogs here but at the same time, I kind of just sucked it up because we were going to be outdoors anyways.\n\nThat was your only mistake. You should have said no to them bringing the dogs if you didn't want dogs there.\n\nThat said, if SIL and BIL expected you to feed their dogs, they needed to say that in advance so you could account for their needs. Apparently, SIL is a \"doggy mommy\" who expects everyone to treat her dogs the way they would human children but lacks the courtesy to ask rather than assuming.\n\nIf SIL and BIL have enough disposable income to feed their dogs people food and are okay with mistreating their dogs that way, that's their prerogative. But so is the burden of making sure they have food to eat. Taking them to a bbq where steak is being served without having 1) asked if it's okay to bring them and 2) asked if you're aware they will need to be fed was a combination of AH moves on their part.\n\n>MIL and FIL are on my side, as apparently she pulls the same shit at their house.\n\nHow did no one think to mention this to you in advance?\n\nYou are NTA.

I am gonna assume no... but if it is not a thing why would she expect food for the dogs?

I never would have let her stay. That's absolutely ridiculous of her and her husband. Did they bring the rest of their house with them as well? The entitlement of some people is just wild.

Entitlement is running rapid these days. Glad you stood your ground. I'd make sure to remind her next time to bring their dog's food with them!", "NTA Jesus some people.", "NTA, also I assume you provided food other than meat so I'm wondering why she just sat there and didn't eat a bread roll or something", "NTA, you bring your dogs, you bring food for them.", "NTA. I have two dogs, one that is very food driven, and I would NEVER assume that people would cook meals for me and my pups.

He is bread obsessed and once figured out he could break open the bread box to feast. \ud83d\udc95 He'll tell you it was worth the hot spots, upset tummy and itchy skin, but we aren't so sure. \n\nMy mum bought him a little tire dog toy and she puts his kibble inside it so he has to roll it around to get the bits. He thinks they're treats and that he's being spoiled, but really it's just 5 or 6 pieces of his regular food.", "I\u2019ll be more careful. Thank you.", "I hate and love that different types of narcissists are where we all win lmao", "It sure is. Thankfully he chewed it enough but he was very uncomfortable pooping it out", "That's great and good to hear. My dog is fine with most dog foods thankfully and doesn't have allergies to the usual ingredients.", "[comment stealing bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ppur4/aita_for_refusing_to_feed_my_sils_after_she_gave/jlavald/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)", "Amen. I thought I disliked chocolate until I tried real chocolate. Blew my mind. (Also blew my wallet, but that's besides the point.) Turns out, I just have an expensive taste and dislike crappy chocolate.", "don't even get me started if you're American. I couldn't believe it the first time I had chocolate in America. I don't even know how to describe the taste but if I really try i'd say it's like a combination of vomit plastic and a spec of chocolate sauce like you put on ice cream.", "My ex's dog once 2lbs of baking chocolate. He barely got him to the vet in time.", "If you don't mind me asking, do you knowingly engage in some of the shittier behaviors that can come with narcissism, or do you side-step them because you see it for what it is?", "Unique like all the other narcissists?", "That would seem to imply you understand that you\u2019re wrong, though. You do know you\u2019re wrong about that, don\u2019t you? Narcissists are everywhere.", "Yep, bakers chocolate is the absolute worst.", "Could you provide me with some examples?", "Obviously, that\u2019s why I said think", "Holy crap!!! My cat loves peanut butter too! I literally made myself a PBJ sandwich for lunch a few minutes ago and his fuzzy butt came running over for a taste.", "Oh my god, pea cat is also a FIEND for yogurt. We actually used to give him a teaspoon of plain, unflavored Greek yogurt a day to help with stomach issues he had as a kitten, and that was on the recommendation of our vet! \n\nOurs are the same about string cheese, though. As soon as they hear those wrappers zip open, they come RUNNING."]}
