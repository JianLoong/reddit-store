If you happen to be at her house when you go into labor then by all means use her hospital, but likewise if you're at your house use your hospital. The day of birthing your son is a day for you and your husband, you get to decide the rules. They can congratulate you and welcome the baby to the world after he's born, no need for a circus at the hospital to appease everyone else. Also congrats on the baby, super exciting time but also stressful - you've got this!", "NTA- Is it just your mother who you think is going to be breaking boundaries, or other members of your family as well? When you are ready, send out a group text with a picture of the baby and the date of birth, weight/height. If anyone gives you grief, tell them why you did it.", "NTA. Your body, your baby, your rules. \n\nAlso you can cover your tracks easily with your first. Say you didn't know what was happening, it was disorienting, came fast, etc. \n\nAlso pro tip: move hours away some time after baby is born. Those family drama catalysts will only accelerate when the baby grows. You can eliminate the whole situation if you live farther away. \n\nCongrats on the baby!", "NTA. This is your birth experience with your husband and you\u2019re a first time parent. You take the time and space that you need and want to from anyone. I would consider stating to your mom that you and your spouse have made the birth plan and once something else is needed you\u2019ll let her know. Nobody needs to be in that experience that you aren\u2019t 1000% comfortable with- it is a vulnerable time. People who are so entitled drive me nuts!", "NTA. You have every right if you want to celebrate this special moment with no one but your husband. You should also be allowed to say this to your mother without her getting angry", "NTA.

Once the baby born you wont even concern about others bullshit... they will shame you for sure however spending quality time with your newborn is the most important thing. After a while they should respect that", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s your life and your pregnancy.  Where and how you give birth is up to you and your husband.  \n\nHonestly, I often feel like there is far too much expectation and pressure on new parents to host a bunch of guests while mom is still recovering and baby is still so little.  There\u2019s nothing wrong about wanting a little time to yourself and settle in. That choice is up to you and your husband, not an angry relative making demands to see your baby. \n\nPlease have the experience you want. Have guests when you want them, not when they guests demand it.  Good luck, I hope it\u2019s an easy labor with a healthy momma and baby!", "NTA. Both my husband and I are the youngest of 7 siblings. By the time my son was 1 week old all of them, including their spouses and children, and our parents had come to meet our baby. It was fun. We had a good time, but it was very busy. If i had to do it again I would have done it differently. Giving birth is a big deal and takes its toll on your body and your mental wellbeing. Your number one priority has to be your baby and you as a close second. If there is ever a time to be selfish, it is in those first weeks after your baby is born. Play by your own rules and never let anyone guilt you into crossing your boundaries in a time when they are most important.", "NTA\n\nYou have the baby where you and your husband decide. Other people's wishes on the location are not relevant. Same with who you have in the delivery suite with you (you're not even TA if you really don't want your husband there). Ditto again for who comes to visit the baby in hospital and when and who comes to your house in the period after new baby is home.\n\nChildbirth is about the mother's wishes and to a lesser extend the father's - everyone else can of course say what they would like from their POV but if you don't agree they have to STFU!", "NTA and if anyone gives you grief about it when you make the announcement - they don't get to meet him until they calm down.\n\nIt's a stressful medical procedure and your mother only cares about her convenience. Do what's best for you. \n\nCongratulations!", "As soon as I read these titles I always know it's NTA already. Birth isn't a spectator sport, you do what is most comfy and best for you.", "NTA...Do whatever works for you and just let the guilt and anxiety go. Your mother has no trouble thinking only of her own convenience,  so why worry about what she thinks?", "Do this exactly as you want it done. This is your child, nobody else\u2019s.  NTA.", "NTA. Your priority is to your child. Also, babies don't tend to arrive exactly on schedule so it wouldn't be unusual for it to happen 'suddenly'.\n\nAs for taking time to settle in first....new grandparents will be desperate to see the new arrival. Although you will want to keep him to yourself, there will be a time when he meets others. Try not to differentiate between you and your husband's sides, but set very clear and very explicit ground rules before they visit. You and your husband also need to be on the same team for this.", "NTA, you have every right to decide who is in or out of the delivery room.  Given your mother's statement about what she would prefer for your delivery shows she is either a narcissist or has narcissistic tendencies.  Best of luck with the delivery.", "Why not just wait until your child is old enough to tell them himself? Age 6? How could they stay mad at a 6 year old?", "NTA \n\nAlso, this is a perfect time to get those boundaries set up. It\u2019s difficult, but the more you practice the easier it gets. \n\nIt\u2019s your birth, your child, your family. You decide. \nAlso, congratulations!", "NTA\nTrust your gut", "NTA, it's common in some part of the world to have time for nuclear family after birth. In my country we have 40 days after birth when you can allow your closest family to come if they are helping around house for cleaning or cooking but nobody else would even ask to come and see baby in those first 40 days. I am always surprised when people have relatives insisting on coming to see baby in first months after birth while parents are getting used to baby and change of life.", "Your body your labor your choices. Nta", "You are most definitely NTA! I too am pregnant and my extremely rude and overbearing SIL has made noises about being at the hospital when I have baby. Absolutely not ma'am. This is about you, hubs and baby, nobody else! Best wishes \u2728\u2764\ufe0f", "I've never had children unfortunately so cant  completely advise from that perspective. But the past year (and being older 47F & having been seriously ill on & off for years) we got married - quickly arranged in 8 months - was very ill in hospital 4 weeks after the wedding then a sudden loss of my beautiful brother. Therefore a wedding & funeral within months along with my own recovery - has been extremely and emotionally draining. The amount of emotions that have bubbled to the surface with so many family&friends - and then my own..has been unexpected and overwhelming. Moral: no matter what you do, you can't please everyone. And our families are for the most part, wonderful and supportive but us humans are humans with faults, warts and all. And its tiring being with people no matter how amazing they are!\n\nAnyway, reading your post has made me realise the same will happen when a baby is born. My (very Scottish) friend said recently \"Aye it's amazing all the insects that come out the woodwork when a baby is on the way\". For me personally, I would be having my Mum at least there, but your Mum doesn't sound like mine. My Mum would never make selfish demands for a start and would totally respect if we asked what you did. \n\nThis time is so exhausting and tiring and special, so it is totally up to you and your husband how you want it all played out. Try not to put so much pressure on yourself, or feel guilty. Be firm, but fair. Yiu dont need to go into great detail why. However they react, you then step away and go back to concentrating on yourself & your pregnancy. Yes, women give birth all the time but your body will need all the energy you can get! Maybe get your Mum, etc to concentrate on the weeks after and how you cant wait for the three of you going for walks, coffee, introducing your little boy to the world. Get her focused on those times, rather than the birth itself? This will be a moment in your life that you will remember until the day you die, so you choose as much as you can anyway - how to goes.
