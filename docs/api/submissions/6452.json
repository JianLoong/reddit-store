If i had to do it again I would have done it differently. Giving birth is a big deal and takes its toll on your body and your mental wellbeing.

But the past year (and being older 47F & having been seriously ill on & off for years) we got married - quickly arranged in 8 months - was very ill in hospital 4 weeks after the wedding then a sudden loss of my beautiful brother. Therefore a wedding & funeral within months along with my own recovery - has been extremely and emotionally draining. The amount of emotions that have bubbled to the surface with so many family&friends - and then my own..has been unexpected and overwhelming. Moral: no matter what you do, you can't please everyone. And our families are for the most part, wonderful and supportive but us humans are humans with faults, warts and all. And its tiring being with people no matter how amazing they are!\n\nAnyway, reading your post has made me realise the same will happen when a baby is born. My (very Scottish) friend said recently \"Aye it's amazing all the insects that come out the woodwork when a baby is on the way\". For me personally, I would be having my Mum there, but your Mum doesn't sound like mine. My Mum would never make selfish demands for a start and would totally respect if we asked what you did. \n\nThis time is so exhausting and tiring and special, so it is totally up to you and your husband how you want it all played out. Try not to put so much pressure on yourself in how you tell them, or feel guilty. Be firm, but fair. You dont need to go into great detail why. However they react, you then step away and go back to concentrating on yourself & your pregnancy. Yes, women give birth all the time but your body will need all the energy you can get! Maybe get your Mum, etc to concentrate on the weeks after and how you cant wait for the three of you going for walks, coffee, introducing your little boy to the world. Get her focused on those times, rather than the birth itself? This will be a moment in your life that you will remember until the day you die, so you choose as much as you can anyway - how it goes.

The way I as a guy view this is does x being there reduce or add to your stress? If anyone adds to it they shouldn't be there. Women go into nesting behavior in weeks leading up and any perceived threat(stressor) will be pushed away.\n\nWhen my sister gave birth birth to her first kid we a system in place with her and her husband there for delivery. My mother and I traded off a support role getting anything they needed and running it to the hospital so the parents could just focus on the newborn. Then after ~72 hours they were comfortable with us staying and getting to meet my niece.  The most important part of this is that the plan was my sister's plan and just having support made the whole process easier."]}
