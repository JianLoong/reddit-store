I\u2019m 5\u20194 and I\u2019ve been growing it out for a really long time. I had waist long golden blonde hair at 14, and I was friends with this one girl who would often tell me how damaged and frizzy it was and how it would look so much nicer if i cut it short. It was then brown as I\u2019d had cut it and I felt that it looked plain and no healthier (as having long or frizzy hair doesn\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019s damaged). I later learned that she was jealous and sabotaging me and decided I\u2019d never listen to hair advice again. \n\nMy sister (25f) is getting married. We are all very excited. Last week she pulled me aside and said my hair is too long, it looks bad and she doesn\u2019t want it in her wedding photos. I thought it was really rude, but I told her I\u2019d wear it up. She said it\u2019s too long to wear up and even when it wear it up it looks too big for my head and body. I told her that\u2019s fine I won\u2019t be in the photos. She told me I\u2019m bound to be in the photos if I\u2019m there so I told her I won\u2019t go as I am not cutting my hair. \n\nMy family are not agreeing her saying it\u2019s her big day and also other things eg I won\u2019t be able to get a job, I look scruffy, I\u2019m getting too old to have hair that long and demanding I cut it. \n\nI want to be clear my hair is no longer frizzy. I use good shampoo for wavy hair so it\u2019s long and wavy. It\u2019s also thick so it isn\u2019t thinning. It\u2019s very shiny and I take good care of it, and get trims so there\u2019s no split ends. I get a lot of compliments towards my hair and I\u2019ve never had any trouble with working and I see no reason to cut it other than the wedding which I\u2019m not willing to do. \n\nI suspect my sister is jealous and doesn\u2019t want my hair to take away her attention but of course she can\u2019t outright say that.", "created_utc": 1685033253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rmrpg/aita_for_refusing_to_cut_my_hair_for_my_sisters/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've been down this road OP, and the criticism and comments never stop even if you do what they want. No, keep your hair how you want it. You have to live with your hair every day, and you deserve to love yourself and your hair too.\n\nMy bio mom and bio sister would tease me for my long, ugly hair and how horrible it was, so I started wearing it up in tight buns and covering it up, since I refused to cut it after my bio mom forced me to cut it all off at 11. They still teased me for my ugly hair when it was up, but less, so I did that for years.\n\nAt least, until my former step mom, when I moved in with my dad full time, said it was wrong to have long hair and not do anything with it. I tried to style it in more ways, but unless it was down and curled (which didn't work because of how long and heavy my hair is), she would say something. So I finally cut it from waist length to lower shoulder length and dyed it. It took five hours and cost a ton of money, but she finally stopped complaining about my hair for like a month- when the color was fading and my hair was now fried from the bleach, and she said I needed to do something with it again. So I kept dying it before just staying blonde, and then I started growing out my hair again and letting the dye fade out slowly. \n\nBy the time she left, my hair was close to how it was before I did all that to it. But now my Dad was complaining about my hair being too long and never being down, but my Grandma complained if I left it down, and said she thought it looked bad that way, and it was too long. Literally, everyone had something to say about my hair. Strangers would compliment it, family hated it, friends usually thought I should do more with it, but it was pretty. \n\nBut honestly, none of them have to deal with your hair every day. Every time I've cut my hair or dyed it for someone else, I never really loved it. You have long, thick hair, that's beautiful I'm sure, and you're the only one who needs to like your hair. If you cut, everyone will talk about how it's too short and you don't do enough with it, and besides that, short hair is way more work. \n\nBut more than that, it's your hair and your choice.

NTA", "She can\u2019t demand you cut your hair, that\u2019s an unreasonable expectation. If she has a certain style she wants the bridal party to adhere to then that\u2019s one thing but making actual changes to your physical body (as a haircut is) is not something you have to do. NTA. \n\nAs a fellow curly girl, I understand the horrible feeling of people commenting on your hair and calling it frizzy etc. Let me assure you, your hair is not unprofessional, that\u2019s coded language stemming from white supremacy actually. Smooth, straight hair was historically deemed more professional because it\u2019s more common in caucasians than the curly/kinky textures common in BIPOC people. Unfortunately these biases still exist but you don\u2019t have to cave to them. \n\nNow all that said, do you ensure your curls are healthy and well hydrated? It sounds like your family hold some harmful ideas so it makes me think you might not have ever been taught how to properly care for your hair. Using the right products for your hair type is crucial for the health and manageability of your hair.", "NTA in this specific instance, but you sound pretty attention seeking. I doubt that your sister is jealous of you, but she--and the rest of the family--are probably more than a little weary of the way you center the world on yourself.", "I might be an outlier, but I think NAH. Of course you don't have to cut it. Of course she wants a certain aesthetic. You do sound like a bit of anAH saying you'll just not be in the photos - she wants you in the photos, she just wants a certain look to them. You can't do lots of styles with hair that long (my hair is to my butt, so I know). She also sounds like a bit of an AH in the way she called it ugly.\n\nConsider doing a donation to Angel Hair that makes wigs for cancer patients at no cost to them. You can feel good about the hair cut, proud of yourself for doing it, & your sister will get to have the look she wants. It'll grow back.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
