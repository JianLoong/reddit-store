Every time I complain my parents get really upset and tell me that I just need to deal with it. I\u2019ve tried to make them beds on the floor but my parents hate it and make me let them sleep in my bed with me.

If your parents are so concerned about your sibling then they should have the kid sleep in their bed. You are too old to be forced to sleep next to your sibling. You need your own space, especially at this age.", "NTA\n\nIf your parents want the little one to bedshare  they need to sleep with them....not you.\n\nNo judgement on the  9 year old as my youngest needed to sleep with me till she was 10/11.... I tried so many times to get her to sleep alone but she had anxiety and sleep issues so I decided to let her choose when she could sleep alone. One day she decided and has never slept with me again. However, it was on me, not my other child to sleep with her. \n\nYour parents have failed here...it is their child and theu need to step up and take the lead and make the sacrifices.", "NTA- It is totally inappropriate. You are also not his parent. They should be the ones dealing with whatever is causing him to not want to sleep alone, not you. It is not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nHave you tried sleeping on the floor yourself?  If your parents understood that you'd rather be alone on the floor than in a bed with your sibling, maybe that'd get through to them?", "NTA\n\nObviously that's preposterous.  But I have no brilliant suggestion about how you can pound some sense into your parents' apparently-loony heads.", "NTA tell your parents you will now be sleeping nude. I'm sorry OP your parents suck.", "Whoaaaa absolutely NTA. Never mind the fact that this is really inappropriate and your parents should be ashamed of themselves - but you aren\u2019t the parent!! It\u2019s not your responsibility to take on the role of being a parent to your sibling because they don\u2019t want to deal with them. I\u2019m sorry that they\u2019re doing this to you, but please know that you\u2019re definitely NTA. Their behavior is wrong and kinda disturbing.", "NTA\n\nIt seems your sibling has a room of their own. If your sibling needs to sleep with someone else it should be your parents not you or they should get you bunk beds or something instead of expecting you to share your bed daily.\n\nI had to share a bed with my older sibling for a bit when I was 12 and she was 16. Neither of us wanted it but we had to share a room. Getting bunk beds was really helpful for us to feel like we had our own space.", "NTA.  Send sibling to sleep with your parents.", "NTA\n\nYou are not your sibling\u2019s parent.\n\nAs a parent of lots of kids, I do empathize with needing to share bedrooms. We physically have more children than rooms, so I understand if that\u2019s the situation.  However we have bunk beds.  \n\nI have also dealt with scared kids. It is simply not appropriate to ask an older sibling to be the parent. I know it\u2019s probably tough to tell your parents that, but they need to deal with it. \n\nA simple solution they will hate is to allow the younger child to sleep with one of them, and one of them sleep in the younger child\u2019s room. I can honestly say that is what I would do (and have done)", "NTA\nYour parents have taken advantage of you for far far too long!!  THIS IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX.  Your aren't even fixing it, you're the band-aid that allows them to put off dealing with it.  It's not easy to stand up to parents, but I wonder if they can tell you why it's ok with them to hurt one child to \"help\" the other?  When they minimize how much it hurts you, tell them that since it's no big deal, sibling sleeps with them now.  Period.  Who can you get support from?  Pediatrician?  School councilor?  Relative?  You may need outside pressure to get them to act.  THIS IS WRONG AND IRRESPONSIBLE OF THEM TO PLACE THIS BURDEN ON YOU.

JFC people shouldn't have kids if they can't do better than this. \n\nYou left out the gender of your sibling. After a certain age, opposite gendered children aren't supposed to be sharing rooms. \n\nYour parents need to knock it tf off with this bs. Holy hell I'm pissed just reading this. In so sorry they're doing that to you!!\n\nTell a trusted adult that can intervene on your behalf. Otherwise, might be a cps call. This isn't ok.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is toxic and borderline abusive to both of you.", "NTA - Starting tomorrow you should tell your parents to get this hillbilly nonsense sorted out.\n\nInform them that you expect privacy to masturbate. Inform them that it won't be your job to tell the 9 year old what you're doing.", "Please tell your school counselor or a trusted teacher about this. You should not be made to share a bed if you're uncomfortable. That's not how it's done in the western part of the world.", "Tell a counselor at school they will get in touch with cps. This is a form of abuse.", "NTA. Tell your parents this is unacceptable. Talk to your sibling and make it clear that you are too old to share a bed, and they are, too. Talk to a teacher or counselor at school. If that does not resolve it, can you stay at a relative's or friend's house for a while? Maybe that will give them a reality check. Most importantly, plan to move out as soon as you can. Apply for colleges and scholarships, make money on the side. This expectation is toxic.", "NTA \n\nIf parents put them in your bed, move to their room or to the living room.", "Nta. It's a nuclear option, but this is the sort of thing that CPS doesn't like.", "NTA\n\nKiddo should sleep with them (not that you could force that)\n\nTry setting up camp on the couch or if you have some money buy a cheap bed and sleep in that in the extra room.

This kind of sleeping arrangement is considered *unhealthy* for children.", "NTA, I would start using your siblings room though, if your sibling needs to be in your bed, you sleep in theirs, problem solved.
