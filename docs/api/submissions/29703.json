Maybe like if she can do this for three months, she can have a friend over sometimes as long as you are there, too. \n\nI would also tread lightly around the \"stripper\" thing. Maybe reframe it as \"potentially dangerous\" instead of \"not respectable.\" There are strippers who make BANK and honestly, good for them.

But it doesn't matter, if you are requiring money from her, as long as what she is doing is LEGAL, you have no right to set boundaries around what she does that does not impact your home.\n\nI disagree with, but fully support your right to set all the rest of those rules though.", "As a father of 3 daughters, 2 are college grads, 1 still in college, allow me to make the point about \u201cgetting paid back\u201d.\n\nI can feel your pain, children not being responsible as we believe they should.\n\nBut you were an adult and a parent who made a financial decision to provide for your daughter to go to college.

A picture of her holding a bong at some other house in Instagram you sought out? Not a violation).\n\nYou can\u2019t control adults, even ones who live with you, even ones who are your kid. You can control your home environment. And you can\u2019t ask for money back, or control where money goes. Like, literally, it just never works.

Assuming that your goal here is to try and help her get to the point that she's an independent, functioning, adult as opposed to just punishing her then you need to be realistic about her earning potential. Basically I think you may need to relax rule 1 a bit in order to help with rule 2.\n\nSo regarding the first two rules I would say you need to have a chat with her about what her long term plans are both for career and for moving out of your house and an agreement on the financial side. One option would be that she does have to repay you for the college but you'll return some or all of the money if she reaches specific milestones for getting her life back on track.", "So under 1) she is paying you, but under 7) you imply that you would be paying her. Which is it?\n\nYou want her to pay you. Her experience is with stripping. 2) is kind of setting her up to fail.\n\nWhile 7) seems like it might be sort of reasonable are they really going to be leeching money from you?

Absolutely and with no doubt.", "YTA - just say no - you are being petty but it\u2019s ultimately because you don\u2019t want to help and you\u2019re too cowardly to admit that.

Alcohol shouldn't be allowed often but it must be allowed on special occasions. as for friends, they should not be allowed near the younger kids.", "If your daughter is homeless and looking for a place to live, asking to be paid back is a stretch. Would you prefer her to go back to stripping or possibly even worse rather than give her a room to stay in while she gets her life on track?", "Soft YTA.\n\nI understand that you're frustrated with your daughter and the fact that she lied to you about finishing college. However, if you want the chance to improve your relationship with her going forward, then this type of controlling approach isn't the way to go about it.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. It is unreasonable for you to ask her to pay back all of the college money. For the time that she lied yes absolutely, but not all of it. You haven't told us why she dropped out (overload, medical issue, social problems?), but I get the impression you wouldn't be asking for money back if she'd simply dropped out instead of stripping. Don't let her job cloud your judgement.\n2. This is unreasonable. if she's working and contributes to your household, that should be enough. It's not for you to tell your adult daughter how she should earn her money. \n3. This is fine.\n4. This is unreasonable. You've basically told your daughter that she isn't allowed to have friends. That's guaranteed to push her away from you and towards the people you seem to think unsavoury. A better approach would be to ask that you meet anyone she wants to bring over and get to know them first.\n5. This is unreasonable. You haven't indicated that your daughter has any addiction issues, so this just reads as spiteful. Are you telling me you wouldn't even allow your daughter, a grown adult, a single wine with dinner? A better approach would be to ask her to keep any alcohol locked away in her room and away from other household members. Set the rule that she can only enjoy alcohol responsibly while living with you (i.e. no coming home wasted).\n6. This is also unreasonable. Same comments as (5).\n7. This is fine.\n\nOverall, your post reads like someone who disapproves of how their child is living and has created a set of rules to \"punish\" them for it. it's your house an no one can stop you, but you might want to think of the lasting damage this will have on your relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
