Maybe reframe it as \"potentially dangerous\" instead of \"not respectable.\" There are strippers who make BANK and honestly, good for them.

But it doesn't matter, if you are requiring money from her, as long as what she is doing is LEGAL, you have no right to set boundaries around what she does that does not impact your home.\n\nI disagree with, but fully support your right to set all the rest of those rules though.", "As a father of 3 daughters, 2 are college grads, 1 still in college, allow me to make the point about \u201cgetting paid back\u201d.\n\nI can feel your pain, children not being responsible as we believe they should.\n\nBut you were an adult and a parent who made a financial decision to provide for your daughter to go to college.

A picture of her holding a bong at some other house in Instagram you sought out? Not a violation).\n\nYou can\u2019t control adults, even ones who live with you, even ones who are your kid. You can control your home environment. And you can\u2019t ask for money back, or control where money goes. Like, literally, it just never works.

Assuming that your goal here is to try and help her get to the point that she's an independent, functioning, adult as opposed to just punishing her then you need to be realistic about her earning potential. Basically I think you may need to relax rule 1 a bit in order to help with rule 2.\n\nSo regarding the first two rules I would say you need to have a chat with her about what her long term plans are both for career and for moving out of your house and an agreement on the financial side.

Her experience is with stripping. 2) is kind of setting her up to fail.\n\nWhile 7) seems like it might be sort of reasonable are they really going to be leeching money from you?

Alcohol shouldn't be allowed often but it must be allowed on special occasions. as for friends, they should not be allowed near the younger kids.", "If your daughter is homeless and looking for a place to live, asking to be paid back is a stretch. Would you prefer her to go back to stripping or possibly even worse rather than give her a room to stay in while she gets her life on track?", "Soft YTA.\n\nI understand that you're frustrated with your daughter and the fact that she lied to you about finishing college. However, if you want the chance to improve your relationship with her going forward, then this type of controlling approach isn't the way to go about it.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. It is unreasonable for you to ask her to pay back all of the college money. For the time that she lied yes absolutely, but not all of it. You haven't told us why she dropped out (overload, medical issue, social problems?), but I get the impression you wouldn't be asking for money back if she'd simply dropped out instead of stripping. Don't let her job cloud your judgement.\n2. This is unreasonable. if she's working and contributes to your household, that should be enough. It's not for you to tell your adult daughter how she should earn her money. \n3. This is fine.\n4. This is unreasonable. You've basically told your daughter that she isn't allowed to have friends. That's guaranteed to push her away from you and towards the people you seem to think unsavoury. A better approach would be to ask that you meet anyone she wants to bring over and get to know them first.\n5. This is unreasonable. You haven't indicated that your daughter has any addiction issues, so this just reads as spiteful. Are you telling me you wouldn't even allow your daughter, a grown adult, a single wine with dinner? A better approach would be to ask her to keep any alcohol locked away in her room and away from other household members. Set the rule that she can only enjoy alcohol responsibly while living with you (i.e. no coming home wasted).\n6. This is also unreasonable. Same comments as (5).\n7. This is fine.\n\nOverall, your post reads like someone who disapproves of how their child is living and has created a set of rules to \"punish\" them for it. it's your house an no one can stop you, but you might want to think of the lasting damage this will have on your relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's a lot of jobs/industries that don't directly benefit society as a whole. A lot even actively harm it I would say. Should all business be able to justify it's existence through its societal impact? \n\n\n> is constantly surrounded by the irresponsible use of drugs, alcohol, ne'rdowells and crime\n\n\nAgain, a lot of industries have this issue and I'm not sure how you propose we only accept jobs if no criminal element partakes in it. \n\n\n\n>  licenses, mandatory regular medical checkups, taxation\n\n\nFuckin what? lol. What would you be medically checking strippers for exactly? Also they're already taxed. \n\n\n>  you cant make one good argument showing it adds value to a functional, modern society.\n\n\nSure you can. For example some research has shown a 25% drop in rape/sexual assault in areas that have legalized prostitution. \n\n\n\n>  Stop glorifying and normalizing sex work.\n\n\nSure thing dude, it should be really easy to get rid of something that's been around for over 100,000 years. We'll knock that one right out next year promise.

If you're a stripper and you go to the cops cause your employer beat you, they will tell you it was your own fault for being a stripper and do nothing about it. Doesn't help that a lot of strip clubs are owned by gangs like Hell's Angel's who pay the cops to not enforce the law.", "There certainly has been a history of women who ran brothels and were pretty awful to the women working there.\n\n...but I suppose it's likely the men were worse.", "Uh.......\n\nHow certain of that are you? The worst treatment I ever received while stripping was at the hand of women bosses.", "With stripping It just comes down to the ppl you know and where you work. \n\nI knew this cartel guy once upon a time..he was like addicted to sex workers and spent countless amounts on them.\nBut if someone were to mess with one everyone that had known that person were def not gonna mess with those girls \ud83d\ude05\nOverall safety not so great. Usually the women who run safe clubs are dating a orginised crime figure who will do their best to kill everyone..", "Right, if you aren\u2019t giving them money/housing there might not be a relationship in their eyes.

I couldn't articulate it quite as well as you, but what a weird suggestion it really was. And the justification is, 'do you want them to live with you forever?' As though that would be the mum's fault! ALL of this is consequence of the daughter's selfish actions. Mum shouldn't have to rip herself off even further just for the pleasure of getting her own home back to herself as soon as possible, when she doesn't even have to take her back in in the first place. Mum's a better person than me, I wouldn't consider letting her move back at all.", "Still ops kid tho.", "I can\u2019t understand wanting to holding some shitty, immature decision making against my college age kids for the long-term foreseeable future, but different strokes for different folks I guess.", "The same structure she raised her with, presumably.

Imagine if sex workers were actually protected under the law. \n\nYou should browse the sex worker subs on Reddit.

Is it about the money or not? \n\n>No good parent would want their child in that industry\n\nOP has not shown themselves to be a good parent, but that aside, requiring immediate repayment of debt is not going to lead to good employment choices. How can her daughter leave stripping if stripping is the only way for her to become financially independent? If OP is requiring that money back asap, then she accepts the means by which that money comes about.\n\nIf she doesn't want her daughter to strip, help her get a better job and pay for her education (directly to the school, it was stupid to give that money to her daughter). Don't demand immediate repayment."]}
