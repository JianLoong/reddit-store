J's been a real wild card his whole life - he's a rapper who's decently well-known regionally, but he isn't nearly well-known enough to consider music a full-time career, though J thinks he's a lot bigger than he is. Pretty much immediately J established himself as a terrible roommate, as he was messy and often brought girls back to the pad, even when I was in it. I initially turned a blind eye and chalked it up to his age, as I did some similar stuff in college. However, the last straw came a few days ago when I got back from a business trip and found my house an absolute mess, as J was in the middle of throwing a party. His music was blasting so loud the neighbors could probably hear it, the place was packed with random people I didn't know, everything was strewn about, and the place was littered with booze and drugs. It took me a while to herd everyone out and once I had done that, I told J to pack his shit and get out, and that if he tried to come back I'd have him arrested. He left in a huff, and after reflecting on this, I think I might've been a little harsh on him.", "created_utc": 1679850678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122ssqb/aita_for_kicking_my_brother_out_and_threatening/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The mess is one thing, but zero information about your own home is another.", "My guess is no", "I agree, I think threatening with being arrested maybe was too far. Kicking the brother out is the right move because he's being put at risk with drugs and people drinking. Imagine what would happen if someone drove home from his apartment and they were in an accident.

If cops showed up you\u2019d be in trouble. He risked that for his own gratification. Maybe some time couch surfing will do him good!", "Yeah. The party was bad enough, but the drugs at op's place. If police found the drugs it would be op's ass on the line as well.", "Yeah, which could get OP a criminal record they didn't earn and potentially cost them their livelihood."]}
