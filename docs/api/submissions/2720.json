Your fiance, however, gets the double AH award.\n\nYou paid the whole rent, so the money he \"gave\" you was to pay back what you laid out for him. It wasn't extra money!\n\nHe stole from you.

He can\u2019t steal it to pay his bills. That he can make you doubt yourself makes me wonder how else he is manipulating you.", "NTA but he honestly sounds terrible. I'll bet his words and actions sounds super familiar to anyone who has been married to (or even known) a narcissist. I don't like throwing that word out there, but honey, please really look at this man you're considering marrying. Does he often blame you when he does something wrong? Does he verbally attack you when he in confronted with his wrong actions and try to turn it around as if you were st fault? Does he normally try to confuse you when he is confronted, by making you doubt whether you're in the right, even though you know you are? It's obvious that he is wrong here, but if you're really having to ask strangers because you now aren't sure, that is concerning. He sounds terrible and way too familiar to me.

And I\u2019d inform him that just because you have cash on hand in your home doesn\u2019t magically just make it up for grabs for him to steal(yes use that word because that is what it is) from you. And what does he mean he won\u2019t pay for anything NEXT time. He didn\u2019t pay for anything THIS time. You did because the the AH used YOUR money. And wanting to use YOUR money for stuff you need is not even remotely selfish. Selfish is taking money that isn\u2019t yours without permission.

Get an agreement in writing for how you'll both handle the bills. \n\nOr, preferably, get rid of this thief and look for an honest person to partner up with. He's shown you who he is.

I know people who can\u2019t control themselves when money is available and must spend it, but they are open about it and just make sure it\u2019s deposited or allocated. The reaction is more concerning as it would become impossible to solve if he doesn\u2019t acknowledge he has a problem and tried to blame you. \n\nId highly suggest a pre- wedding financial counseling or training course to discuss agreed upon concepts, strategies and conflict resolutions in regards to money.
