I said \u201cwho cares? I don\u2019t think the landlord will ever find out, I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d And she went along with it. I never said it was impossible that the landlord could find out, and mind you she had to have seen the lease if she signed it. Anyway, I\u2019ve actually never lived with this girl yet, but I got an email from the landlord today saying the dog has to leave immediately and we\u2019ll be charged 20$/day till it leaves and 150$ flat. I\u2019m not asking if I\u2019m liable by the way. I don\u2019t mind splitting it either. \n\nSo I called Helen about the email and I was like hey did you see that? And she said her mom asked how she didn\u2019t know that and she said she  never got a copy of the lease (or something like that) and she was all upset. That comment made it seem like she was saying she didn\u2019t know that dogs weren\u2019t allowed. I  understand why Helen is upset but she did know dogs aren\u2019t allowed because I specifically remember telling her. I figured that was at her own risk..I\u2019m not even upset about the consequences even though I\u2019m equally liable to pay the fees because I was aware that it was possible the landlord would find out. \n\nSo am I the asshole for allowing her to move in with the dog? \n\nEDIT: HELEN SIGNED THE LEASE! She is on the lease. I told Helen dogs aren\u2019t allowed and she also signed the lease.\n\nEdit: I also offered that she keep the dog at my parent\u2019s house (an hour away) until she brings  it to florida  (where her parents are). We\u2019re not in south (I don\u2019t wanna be specific about where I live lol).", "created_utc": 1693275931, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1645uc6/aita_after_my_landlord_found_out_my_roommate_has/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should have been more responsible and found out exactly what the pet policy was and asked for a copy of the lease.

I honestly have no idea how they found out, I think the downstairs or next door neighbor mentioned it in passing. The dog has been there for the entire summer.

You both took a risk by allowing her to stay with a dog knowing that dogs are not allowed. You both are equally responsible- you shouldn't have given her the ok to begin with, and she shouldn't have stayed in a building that she knew didn't allow dogs.", "Helen was aware, FAFO. She signed the lease, she was more than capable of reading it. If she needs her hand held the whole way then maybe she shouldn\u2019t have moved out from her parents. If I was her and I wanted to be 100% certain my dog would be okay, I\u2019d have just found a new place or confirmed with the LANDLORD. OP said \u201cwho cares, they probably won\u2019t find out,\u201d which does not mean pets are okay. Sure, ya shouldn\u2019t have had a pet, but let\u2019s be real: loooots of people hide their pets because it\u2019s so hard to find pet friendly housing. Not saying it\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s not that rare of a thing. \n\n\nAre people also missing that OP is also A-OK splitting the fees? Seeing that they started a new lease together (this wasn\u2019t a sublet!), it is totally on Helen to be aware of the rules if she doesn\u2019t want to get crapped on by fees.

Obviously any time you break a lease, there\u2019s consequences.

The issue is Helen is acting like this is all new and she had no idea and getting mad at OP when Helen signed the lease herself and should\u2019ve taken her own responsibility to be aware of the lease rules."]}
