I said \u201cwho cares? I don\u2019t think the landlord will ever find out, I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d (Edit: I don\u2019t remember the exact verbiage but essentially I said I don\u2019t care personally if a dog is there, but it\u2019s not allowed but I won\u2019t say anything. ) And she went along with it. I never said it was impossible that the landlord could find out, and mind you she had to have seen the lease if she signed it. Anyway, I\u2019ve actually never lived with this girl yet, but I got an email from the landlord today saying the dog has to leave immediately and we\u2019ll be charged 20$/day till it leaves and 150$ flat. Edit: I\u2019m not asking if I\u2019m liable by the way. I don\u2019t mind splitting it either. \n\nSo I called Helen about the email and I was like hey did you see that? And she said her mom asked how she didn\u2019t know that and she said she  never got a copy of the lease (or something like that) and she was all upset. That comment made it seem like she was saying she didn\u2019t know that dogs weren\u2019t allowed. I  understand why Helen is upset but she did know dogs aren\u2019t allowed because I specifically remember telling her. I figured that was at her own risk..I\u2019m not even upset about the consequences even though I\u2019m equally liable to pay the fees because I was aware that it was possible the landlord would find out. \n\nSo am I the asshole for allowing her to move in with the dog? \n\n\n\nEDIT: HELEN SIGNED THE LEASE! She is on the lease. I told Helen dogs aren\u2019t allowed and she also signed the lease.\n\n\nEdit: I also offered that she keep the dog at my parent\u2019s house (an hour away) until she brings  it to florida  (where her parents are).

She is presumably an adult with the capacity to understand the stipulations of that contract, and you simply told her you were willing to be lenient and not disclose her having a dog to the landlord. She took that risk willingly, she had every opportunity to opt out and take responsibility for the potential consequences. \n\nYou also said you were willing to accept and split the fees so you\u2019re also accepting fault in the matter for violating the terms of the lease. In all honesty\u2014I don\u2019t have a ton of sympathy towards the landlord in this situation and unless substantial damage was caused, which wasn\u2019t stated so I doubt that\u2019s the case. It seems like they\u2019re a property management company trying to capitalize off of a minor indiscretion. As a landlord, I use a legal blank lease that bars pets without landlord approval but it\u2019s rarely an issue, but I know many that take advantage of that clause to harm tenants. \n\nI also think offering boarding for her dog in the meantime was going far out of your way to rectify the situation.

That\u2019s the reason the bot exists, because people change their stories. Your edits weren\u2019t crazy or anything, but they did help you shape your story after you had gotten some negative feedback, so it\u2019s a little unfair and misleading.", "That\u2019s what a deposit\u2019s for. A dogs not doing $20 a day damage is it?\n\nThe equivalence is deliberate, to highlight how some landlords think that because they own the house, they decide how their tenants live. So in no way false. Some have the attitude of \u2018my house, my rules\u2019, like an entitled parent, not respecting that for the duration of the tenancy it\u2019s the tenants house, and the tenants life.\n\n\n\u2018They have every right to ban dogs\u2019. They have no reason to want to. I don\u2019t know where you are, but I\u2019ve already said that it\u2019s illegal to try and ban a dog where I am, so we\u2019ll have to agree to disagree on that one.\n\nI can\u2019t see how you can view anyone but the landlord that\u2019s trying to drop a made up sudden charge on someone\u2019s home as TA. Maybe explain it plainly for me.", "Oh okay that makes sense", "I never said the landlord wouldn\u2019t care\u2026", "I didn\u2019t say that though, I said it\u2019s unlikely the landlord would notice. I never said oh he might see it and not care..", "I like engaging with the people who comment on my post. Idk what to tell ya.", "Wait you\u2019re right I found something that was totally new ugh idk I added \u201cedit\u201d to it. I\u2019ll have to be more careful if I ever post on here again. I\u2019m not intending to be deceitful honestly, I want people to fully understand it. I think even with the facts correctly understood, there\u2019s room for disagreement. That\u2019s why I posted", "I mean I didn\u2019t mean that, it was just sloppy. I think my clarifications were so basic though lol, it was basically reiterations of what I already said but just spelt out extremely explicitly.\n\nBut again, just check the bot OG post.", ">The equivalence is deliberate, to highlight how some landlords think that because they own the house, they decide how their tenants live.\n\nIt is literally their house, so yes, they can impose some rules. Where I live, they can say no dogs. Apparently, that's okay where OP lives. They don't have to require a deposit for dogs if dogs are banned.\n\nAnd yes, you made a false equivalency. It was insulting actually. I'm not going to explain why. I'd rather not debate you further on this.", "Maintenance came my apartment one day and I joked that my dog was legal and that I pay my $35/mo to the complex. Both guys said they didn't care,  and there are lots of dogs not registered with the complex. That's the only scenario I could have seen your lease mate getting away with it. \n\nLeases are long to read,  and she may have just taken your reassurance, without reading over the pet policy.", "I\u2019m not confused and neither are they. You\u2019re just an idiot", "OP didn\u2019t say that in their original post for a start. That was an edit that they didn\u2019t say was an edit.\n\nThey are also still an AH for all the reassurances without checking with the landlord. \n\nThe original post reads a lot different from the edited post.", "Well, YTA for arguing with people a bunch lol. Take your L man.", "You\u2019re not debating, you\u2019re just being stubbornly wrong.\n\nBeing legal and being ok are not the same thing.\n\nFor all I know you might be from the kind of place where it\u2019s legal to shag a pig, would you be happy if you walked in on your wife doing it?\n\nThis is AITA, not, is what I\u2019m doing legal. A core ethic of this sub is stamping out that brainless type of thinking.\n\nIt\u2019s legal for companies to plumb an orphanage with cancer inducing pipes.

The problem is the arguments were full of strawmen, false equivalencies, and other fallacies (i.e, holes).
