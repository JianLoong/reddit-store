I said \u201cwho cares? I don\u2019t think the landlord will ever find out, I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d (Edit: I don\u2019t remember the exact verbiage but essentially I said I don\u2019t care personally if a dog is there, but it\u2019s not allowed but I won\u2019t say anything. ) And she went along with it. I never said it was impossible that the landlord could find out, and mind you she had to have seen the lease if she signed it. Anyway, I\u2019ve actually never lived with this girl yet, but I got an email from the landlord today saying the dog has to leave immediately and we\u2019ll be charged 20$/day till it leaves and 150$ flat. Edit: I\u2019m not asking if I\u2019m liable by the way. I don\u2019t mind splitting it either. \n\nSo I called Helen about the email and I was like hey did you see that? And she said her mom asked how she didn\u2019t know that and she said she  never got a copy of the lease (or something like that) and she was all upset. That comment made it seem like she was saying she didn\u2019t know that dogs weren\u2019t allowed. I  understand why Helen is upset but she did know dogs aren\u2019t allowed because I specifically remember telling her. I figured that was at her own risk..I\u2019m not even upset about the consequences even though I\u2019m equally liable to pay the fees because I was aware that it was possible the landlord would find out. \n\nSo am I the asshole for allowing her to move in with the dog? \n\n\n\nEDIT: HELEN SIGNED THE LEASE! She is on the lease. I told Helen dogs aren\u2019t allowed and she also signed the lease.\n\nEdit: I had only been living at this property for three months when I met Helen and discussed signing a lease with her that started in June but that I wouldn\u2019t be there for the first few months. I never saw or met the landlord and my previous roommate who had been there for two years never did either. The fact that the landlord found out was a strange fluke. \n\nEdit: I also offered that she keep the dog at my parent\u2019s house (an hour away) until she brings  it to Arizona   (where her parents are).

She is presumably an adult with the capacity to understand the stipulations of that contract, and you simply told her you were willing to be lenient and not disclose her having a dog to the landlord. She took that risk willingly, she had every opportunity to opt out and take responsibility for the potential consequences. \n\nYou also said you were willing to accept and split the fees so you\u2019re also accepting fault in the matter for violating the terms of the lease. In all honesty\u2014I don\u2019t have a ton of sympathy towards the landlord in this situation and unless substantial damage was caused, which wasn\u2019t stated so I doubt that\u2019s the case. It seems like they\u2019re a property management company trying to capitalize off of a minor indiscretion. As a landlord, I use a legal blank lease that bars pets without landlord approval but it\u2019s rarely an issue, but I know many that take advantage of that clause to harm tenants. \n\nI also think offering boarding for her dog in the meantime was going far out of your way to rectify the situation.
