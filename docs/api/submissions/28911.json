We are gonna skip the \"taking advantage\" and the \"doesn't want a regular job\" and \"ALL his money goes to child support\" (it's supposed to be a percentage of his income, NOT all but ok we're skipping this) because you have feelings about this. For your own reasons you are on the fence about this. We are outside perspective, he must have his good qualities so don't shit all over him right? Ok. Let's look at it this way.\n\nA responsible hardworking person CAN fall on hard times and can get into a rough patch. But by the time a person is 44 they should not be moving into a younger person's apartment and be completely unable to provide any kind of financial assistance AND STILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A FUTURE FOR A FAMILY. It is not possible. He can freelance OUTSIDE of his regular job that he takes up so he doesn't have to rely on you TWELVE YEARS HIS JUNIOR to take care of him. That is not being responsible or dependable. You are choosing your future here, right here, right now. Your future is bearing his children, working to pay for those children, paying for childcare - because he won't want to take care of them, it will affect his freelance of course - AND pay for all the bills you are already paying. Take a minute and do your own individual research. Find a friend with your goal # of kids. Let's say 3 kids, about 3 years apart. How much are they paying for clothes, food, toys, larger living space (since it was an apartment for only you I'm doubting it has space for a 5 person family) and call around for actual numbers on childcare for those ages. Sit down and look at those numbers. IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT. This is your life, not his. His life is coasting on your back. This isn't \"2 years wasted\" this is 2 years figuring out what you want in your life, your relationship. He is showing you exactly who he is and what he wants from life. Words are easy and free, but actions cost sweat. Hell, call up his ex (ex? Baby mama? Unclear) and ask her, woman to woman, what happened from her point of view. Compare that with the man you see, and decide what you want from life. 32 is not \"take what you can get\" old ok? My first kid came at 34 and now I have 5. You've got this. Get the life YOU WANT. Because that's the life you will have to live with. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA \nMy husband went without a job for 6 months, 3 of those I worked and ended up getting \"let go\" for medical reasons.
