Take a minute and do your own individual research. Find a friend with your goal # of kids. Let's say 3 kids, about 3 years apart.

This isn't \"2 years wasted\" this is 2 years figuring out what you want in your life, your relationship. He is showing you exactly who he is and what he wants from life. Words are easy and free, but actions cost sweat. Hell, call up his ex (ex? Baby mama? Unclear) and ask her, woman to woman, what happened from her point of view. Compare that with the man you see, and decide what you want from life. 32 is not \"take what you can get\" old ok? My first kid came at 34 and now I have 5. You've got this. Get the life YOU WANT.

There is no way you can depend on a man that refuses to move on when he becomes unsuccessful in his career.  He is too old to be acting this way. You definitely can't have children with him under the circumstances.", "NTA he's taking advantage of you. He deliberately hasn't sought new clients because he expects you to support him.

It doesn't have to be all or nothing.", "NTA, but you're enabling him.

It could be that he feels bad about mooching off you so when you bring it up he's embarrassed and becomes defensive. When he has a minute to breath he shows he's still fun loving etc but often he's stressed and hiding it. Child support is tak8ng everything he makes which would be demoralising for him. He could catch a break in two three months and 'make it' and this would all be worth it. \nOr he could be in the same position three months later.\n\nYou have to read him, remove emotions and feelings and look at him. Is he really making an effort to find work or bs'ing you? Is his anger at the subject (not providing income) or his own inadequacy? \n\nAnother thing to consider is what are you to him? A cash cow to keep him financially secure until he makes it and then you are not needed? Or the dear sweet girlfriend that puts up with him at his worst to be there at his best?\n\nAt 44 he could just need one good break to make it, or he could be Jonah always seeking his white whale.\n\nNTA.
