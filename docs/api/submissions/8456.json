I still have rules for my brother based on his past behavior however. He can't be alone in any room excelt the bathroom, and even then he has 20 minutes or I'm knocking every 30 seconds till he's out.\n\nHe isn't allowed to bring his girlfriend at all, having to watch one of them is work enough. He can't hold or talk to my daughter (1) and there have to be at least three other adults in the room if both of them are.

He can't ask me or my husband about work or money, since in the past those conversations led to him asking for it. \n\nHe never had an issue with alcohol, so he still drinks on occasions, but he can't at my house, I'm worried it will set off a relapse.

Your brother is obviously trying to turn it all around. You may be crushing his confidence in his progress. YTA", "YTA. While a few rules might lean towards reasonableness, most are just overbearing and punitive.  I would think that it would simply be easier to remove him from your life rather than police his behaviour, if these are the kind of rules you want him to follow. I'm shocked he's even willing to come to your house.", "The baby rule is complete insanity. I can understand one other adult being there but not speaking to her?\n\nI think you've gone on a bit of a power trip. For this yta to me.", "Info: has he had relapses or damaged/stolen anything of yours since he got sober? Two years sober (half his adult life) is a long time to be holding onto your anxieties to this level, unless he\u2019s done anything in the meantime to make you think he\u2019ll imminently and spectacularly explode in your house in particular\u2026", "INFO. What behaviours has he shown that lead to all of these specific rules? Has he stolen from you? Had he abused or hurt children? Are the rules based on previous behaviour or on assumptions?", "Not drinking at your house is a reasonable rule. The rest is, frankly, insane. Heaven forbid your brother has diarrhea at your house because you're going to be busting in on him every 30 seconds while he's blowing up your toilet.\n\nLook, I have addict family members and I know how it is. But he's been sober two years dude. You need to find a way to extend some trust. If you can't trust him, he shouldn't coming to visit you.\n\nYTA", "YTA, this is incredibly over controlling. Can\u2019t he do any of those things when he is not in your house? So what do you think is really being accomplished with these rules while he is in your house?\n\nHe is years sober, and does not need your rules for him or you to have a safe get together.", "YTA and not helping him at all. You are being way too harsh. He's 2 years sober. You need to stop treating him like he hasn't accomplished that. You're creating a toxic environment and continuously punishing him for the past.", "ETA YTA saw the comment about you thinking he\u2019d sell her for drugs, he would be better off without you in his life constantly treating him like a predator\n\nI nfo: why can\u2019t he interact with your daughter without a posse to watch him? I can reason my way through your other rules but not this one. He can\u2019t talk to her, a baby?", "YTA he\u2019s been recovered for 2 years and your treating him like he\u2019s still addicted. You are being harsh - been 2 years. And bothering him in the bathroom? Come on.", "YTA. Addiction is a disease but if he is controlling It you can\u2019t keep treating him like he has some type of handicap. It sounds like It was many many moons ago, and while you still may feel hurt, holding onto all of this isn\u2019t helping. Instead of having these rules for him just stop hosting events at your house. You clearly aren\u2019t comfortable with It.", "Has he ever been violent? The rule about needing three other adults in the room honestly seems absurd of there isn't more to the story than previous addiction. I think YTA for not letting his girlfriend over if she is sober too. Two years is a long time and you should give him credit. I understand the suspicion will likely always be there, but a couple of those rules in particular seem pretty harsh, to be honest.", "YTA. \n\nThis is incredibly mean-spirited. He has never posed a danger to children and has never stolen from you. He stole from his parents a decade ago. He has been in recovery for two years and you are still treating him as if he is actively an addict. You won't even meet his serious long-term partner. And use phrases like you have to \"watch him\" although there is no indication that you need to. \n\nHe is also a recovering addict, not an active addict so making comments about addicts being \"unpredictable\" and referencing crime stories is ridiculous. \n\nIf you don't want him over don't have him over. Quit hosting family functions if you plan to treat one person like a constant threat.", "Jesus Christ you are paranoid. Your brother isn't going to fucking kidnap your daughter for a baggie of coke.\n\nI know, your house, your rules and you do what you want, but you're treating him like a child. Your not his probation officer. The rules are just REALLY really specific and strict and it's frankly more insulting than it is helping. If you don't trust him just don't have him over. Don't kick the man while he's trying to get up. And this is coming from someone with an uncle that has spent a few different lengths of years in prison for all of the shit he got into bc he was also a huge addict. You know how I deal with it? I just don't invite him over.", "One of the hardest parts of being sober is knowing people are waiting for you to fail. It freaking sucks because it adds to your low self esteem and feels like no matter what you do to fix things, you\u2019ll always be a piece of *^^ addict. I think you could greatly benefit from getting some help, even if it\u2019s from a 12 step group for families of addicts. As much as I hate to say this, YTA (but you don\u2019t have to be)", "YTA, sounds as if he has turned his life around but you\u2019re still treating him as if he\u2019s garbage. Cut him out of your life or ease up on him. God, if it was me that had a past drug addiction, spent 2 years clean and bettering myself but my sister treated me like this I would no longer have a sister.", "NAH if brother is okay with it. But if you're just looking for what other people think is reasonable, then of your rules:\n\nReasonable - not being alone in rooms (no need to do that at a social event anyway), having a set time to leave (just setting a boundary on the visit).\n\nUnreasonable - his girlfriend can't come (she hasn't wronged you, you're just judging her for NA), he can't talk to your daughter (what's he going to say... \"you should do coke\"???), there need to be 3 adults supervising him around your child (1 isn't enough? You think someone with no history of violence will overpower 2 adults in order to do hurt his tiny family member?), and he can't ask about work (it's too common of a conversation topic to keep off the table).\n\nUndecided - drinking. For some people this is a trigger and for some it's not - it sounds like it's not a trigger for him since he drinks on occasion so policing it seems a little too strict, but I can understand the concern on that one.", "I would go no contact with you if I were him.", "NTA for setting ground rules, but some of your rules are AH behavior. Also weird to be weaponizing your daughter against your brother as punishment, what is the story there? He's been sober for 2 years, this isn't like a fresh recovery where concern about addicts around babies seems even reasonable. \n\nUnreasonable - girlfriend can't come, can't hold or talk to your daughter, needing 3 adults?? in a room if he's there with her vs just 1.\n\nReasonable - not allowed to be alone in random rooms in your house, has to leave at a set time, asking about money, drinking in your home", "YTA. It\u2019s beyond controlling. I get it that you don\u2019t want to relapse, but treating him like he is on drugs all the time when he\u2019s been sober for 2 years is just creating extra anxiety for him (and your whole family). If he wanted to do drugs he would do them regardless of your overbearing rules. Stop reading so many stories and treat him like a human ffs. \u201cHe may steal a baby\u201d seriously? Do you really think that low of your own brother? You\u2019re a shitty sister, and frankly if I were him I would have told you to F off several times already. He\u2019s sober, he\u2019s going to meetings, he\u2019s in a relationship, allow him to grow and trust him a little. Sure don\u2019t keep heroin at home, but don\u2019t treat him like a diseased dog", "YTA\u2026u can\u2019t stop him from relapsing with all the rules and it seems like u r humiliating him for the past. I am surprised he comes to ur house at all", "It\u2019s really hard to make a judgment without knowing the full history of his behaviors. I myself have had relationships with addicts, and I always found it difficult to trust someone who has betrayed my trust and taken advantage of me in the past. \n\nI believe what you\u2019re doing is normal for someone in your situation. However from an objective point of view, IF AND ONLY IF the 2 year sobriety is true, I would start lifting some of these rules in waves. Easier said than done, I know. If I were in your brother\u2019s shoes and I truly am sticking with my sobriety, rebuilding that trust with you would help me feel supported.", "YTA. I have a very similar situation - my younger brother is an addict too. You said he's been sober for TWO years. What you're doing is actually damaging to his recovery. \n\nDecide if you want him in your life or not. He doesn't have to be in your life, but you don't get to treat him like this forever and keep punishing him for past mistakes he's made. Either you forgive and move on, or you let him go.\n\nYou should get help for yourself becuase his addiction clearly affected you deeply, which is normal, but you need help.", "Why can't he speak to your child?", "He can\u2019t even speak to a 1 year old? How do you think he\u2019d negatively influence a 1 year old? YTA! Also given your attitude about addiction, maybe it\u2019s best you server ties with your brother. He need support and community. You sound like you\u2019re looking to a parole officer. Do him a favor and break off contact. He deserves better!", "NAH. Only thing bordering on asshole is the not speaking to your daughter even if it\u2019s supervised. He burned a lot of bridges and caused trauma for you it seems so I understand why you\u2019re keeping your guard up. Just make sure you\u2019re phrasing things well and your tone is supportive. Use \u201cI\u201d statements. Ex: \u201cim so happy you\u2019re doing well. I struggle to trust you due to past experiences. I am excited to have you back in my life, but it\u2019s going to take time for me to trust you again.\u201d \n\nAlso if proves to you that he\u2019s sober and following the rules you set out Id be open about having contact with the gf (as long as she respects your rules as well).", "NTA.  It's your house. Your rules.  I do think your brother needs to drop you like the toxic person you are because you are not good for his sobriety.  \n\nI get it, addicts lose all trust from loved ones.  It is reasonable, but why bother having him over if this is how you feel about him 2 years sober?  If you don't want to allow him to gain your trust back, just stop having him around.  You're so paranoid that you think he is going to kidnap your child.  Just leave him alone & let him enjoy his sober life.\n\nIt's things like this that cause people to relapse.  If you want to continue to treat a recovering addict like an active addict, it is harmful to their psyche.  It tells them that no matter how hard they work, they will never be good enough.  This is why I say he needs to go no contact with you.", "NTA, but perhaps chill on some of the rules when he continues to show good progress. This gives him positive reinforcement on his behaviour. But I'm sure he understands from NA that he can't expect everyone around him to forgive and forget quickly. If the complaints are coming from him through your parents, see if you can do sibling counselling so you can discuss this with a neutral person", "YTA. I understand why you have some of these rules and it\u2019s good that you aren\u2019t leaving him alone in rooms, bathroom,etc if you\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll use. HOWEVER your thing about holdings or talking to your kid is whack and not cool at all. Basically you\u2019re showing your brother that he is an awful person and isn\u2019t worthy of your family. I wonder if you\u2019re not hurting him with that part of your behavior. Sounds like he\u2019s trying but you\u2019re hyper vigilant and not in a good way. The alcohol thing is cool, your not accepting  the GF whom he\u2019s serious with is not.", "Nta, you protect yourself and yoyr family first, then ypur brother", "Gentle NAH. My brother is a drug addict so I understand your fear.\nHowever with 2yrs of sobriety under his belt and no evidence of relapse and family relationships going ok it\u2019s time to loosen the rules and let him further into your life. This is probably something to speak to a therapist about.", "\\> he never had a problem with alcohol so he still drinks on occasions\n\nIf your brother is in NA, then he knows that we are very clear about the fact that alcohol is a drug. He's not addicted to drugs, he is simply an addict. It doesn't matter what he is using, he will abuse it.\n\nThis is a good boundary to have.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA. Well, it's your house and his past behavior that earned these rules. Once he regains your trust, rules will change.  ONCE BITTEN TWICE SHY rule applies.", "I'm going to play devil's advocate.  NTA. I am a child of addiction and I can say, what I lived through would change most people's tones about their loved one. I get it, you think they're being too harsh, no they're protecting themselves. Two years isn't that long and an addict can literally relapse any time. Now, if it were 5, 10 years maybe they'd be less worried, but my dad relapsed all the time. It could be two years and he'd still have a relapse on a bad day. I think be cautious is completely warranted. I wonder if those who are giving yta have experienced someone stealing from them often and having their life ruined by something they never did. Until yo6ve experienced it, you can't imagine the pain and suffering. Addicts get clean and the belief is that everyone else is supposed to be happy and fine with that person.

Treating someone who's never physically harmed a human being like a potential kidnapper is absurdly paranoid. No drinking or being alone? Okay. The rest? Woof.\n\nOP, you should consider educating yourself about addiction and recovery. Because you sound like everything you 'know' about it is from Fox News and TV cop procedurals. Being 2 years sober is huge! And you can't punish people by refusing to acknowledge change. It's a shitty thing to do. Either you accept he's turned his life around and go from there, or don't and go NC. Being his warden or PO isn't an option.", "YTA a lot of your rules are super restrictive for no good reason.

Your need to work towards trusting.", "Your behavior and attitude toward your brother is frankly despicable. You should be absolutely ashamed of yourself. Your brother has been sober for two years.

I can understand the drinking and money talk being off limits but the rest like you're punishing him for scenarios that he's never shown any inclination towards. Also he was a literal child during the majority of his active addiction. You sincerely need therapy to address why you cannot either go no contact or accept that your brother has decided to become a better man now that he is an adult.", "YTA.  I am sure you still have resentment towards your brother.  I have an addict sibling and its hard to let go.  All you see is the past slips that led to them destroying everything over and over.  Its probably best for HIM that you aren't around him for awhile if you are this hung up on something 2 years in the past.", "YTA\n\nSunshine, pardon the french here,  but you need to either shit or get off the pot. Either forgive your brother, go get therapy and attend some meetings yourself, or cut him off entirely and make it clear that he is no longer welcome around you or your kids.\n\nWhat you are experiencing is what was originally called \"co-dependancy\". You only know how to interact with your brother as an addict, the way he only knew how to handle life by using. Now he's not using, but you're still acting like he is, and you don't understand why it's not having good results anymore. It's like you're tying a tourniquet around a reattached limb. You needed the tourniquet when the limb was chopped off and he was bleeding to death, but he's got the damn thing sewn back on and gone through P&T. He doesn't need you to stop the hemorrhage, he needs you to stop trying to strangle his healthy limbs! \n\nMost experts in recovery advocate for the *entire family* to participate in treatment programs, because the damage your brother did isn't limited to himself and his own body. He hurt you and your husband and your whole family, but now you are continuing the cycle of that hurt unnecessarily, and now *you* are the one doing more harm than good, because the thing you're guarding against (the addiction) is gone...and now all your old ways aren't going to work anymore.\n\nYou *do not* owe him your forgiveness. But if you want him in your family, you do have to give him space to exist. You do not owe him your time, but you do not get to promise him a relationship and then continually move the goalposts. If you do not want a relationship with him, that's fine. But you don't get to tell him you want him, and then continually demand the old, unhealthy patterns of behavior. Like I said: Shit, or get off the pot. Either reject your brother for having been an addict, or accept that he's changed, and work on changing yourself.\n\nRight now? Honestly, your brother is better off without you. Cut him off, deal with the consequences, and let him rebuild without your negativity getting in the way. You would be doing more for his sobriety by never talking to him again than you are by throwing all these rules and condemnations at him. He needs this kind of crap like a hole in the head.\n\nAnd if you *do* want to rebuild, go to a meeting with him, and ask the old fogies with their ten and twenty year chips what al-anon or family counseling groups they would recommend for you. Because you need professional grade help, the same way your brother did, and the meetings are free.", "YTA leave your brother alone. The only thing that might set him off is you treating him like a piece of dirt when he's been sober for multiple years and is clearly trying hard to put his past behind him.

That has to be earned and you\u2019re not there yet.", "Info: we know what your mother thinks of the rules, but what does he think? \n\nI don\u2019t think all the ground rules are that unreasonable. He\u2019s obviously done a lot to break your trust over the years, so not allowing him to be alone in your house isn\u2019t outrageous. \n\nThe two things I\u2019d question are 1) banning the GF - at some point you\u2019re probably going to need to acknowledge that she\u2019s a part of his life and if you want a relationship with him, it will include his partner. \n2) not interacting with your children. I can understand not letting him be with them unsupervised. But not letting him hold or talk to her is extreme. You might get away with it whilst she\u2019s young, but eventually she\u2019s going to have a lot of questions about the uncle who comes over but she can\u2019t talk to. \n\nIf you don\u2019t trust him enough to interact with her in your own home, then perhaps you shouldn\u2019t let him in at all.", "NAH. \n\nI understand that a lot of trust has been lost, and it sounds like these ground rules are in place to potentially lead to a better relationship with more trust. \n\nI think maybe after some time, if he proves that he will uphold these rules, then maybe they can be modified in the future. \n\nUltimately, it's your home and family, and based on his past actions, this is what it takes for you to be comfortable in your home. If he doesn't want to adhere to the rules, then he doesn't come over. That's his choice, and if he's going to NA, then he should be familiar with stories and rules like this.", "YTA. Just say you don't want your brother there.", "YTA, hard. Yes people can relapse at anytime, but what you and your husband are doing are making it more likely. \n\nI'm not saying that you have to remove all of them, but they do need to relax, just a little, because what you are showing him us that it doesn't matter how good he's doing or how long he's been clean, you are always going to treat him like he's at the height of his addiction before you cut him off, and one day he's gonna get this nasty little thought.\n'If OP and her Husband are always gonna treat me like I'm dirty, why's it worth the effort to stay clean?' He's gonna brush it off at first, but it will eventually lead to one of two things; one, he'll decide its not worth it, and cut YOU off, knowing he doesn't deserve to be treated like a junkie just minutes away from ODing the rest of his life, and your mother is likely to go with him, or two, he decides it's not worth it and falls off the wagon, because if even his big sister doesn't believe in him, what's the point of trying?\n\n It's been two years, you stated that he's worked hard to be where he is, so show him you understand the effort and work he's done, and that you are willing to work to trust him. Let GF come around, maybe not for the big things when everyone's running around, but have a little double date, just the four of you and ask your mom to babysit your daughter. If they ask, say you wanted to be able to focus on getting to know GF, and not having it split between her and the baby. Instead of a time he has to leave, just say he can't be the last one there, instead of three other adults with him and your daughter, go down to two. Like I said, it doesn't have to be drastically different, but you need to show a little more trust in him. Just a bit, and work your way up to fully trusting him again. If you never want him truly alone with your daughter, or to drink in your house, that is fine, but there are more freedoms in prisons than some of what you're giving your brother, and it isn't helping anyone involved. \n\nAlso, please get therepy for you and your husband. It's hard learning to move on and start to trust again, and you two obviously need the help.

One of my parents has... several siblings (my parent is the eldest). One of these siblings (D) has had multiple addictions, relapses, hospitalizations, you name it. D 'got clean' in the late 1990's but not completely... see, D never quit drinking 'socially'. \n\n So, the family decided to police their alcohol use - no more than two drinks at any given person's place (whether that was my folks, or any of my aunts/uncles). Yeah... that was a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* nightmare. Sneaking drinks, lying about how many they'd had, spiking drinks (found that one out when they had a glass of 'Orange Juice' and one of the little kiddos took a mouthful... not fun). And the 'missing' stuff - 10 bucks here, 20 there, all the ladies stopped taking off their rings when they were cooking (yes, you take off your bigger rings when you're stuffing a turkey for instance). Eventually it was 'no, you can't drink at our house' across the board (the night my husband had to physically remove D from my parents house after D tried to strike my mother for refusing them another drink was the breaking point - probably because a) the only reason they didn't hit my mom was that my husband has stupid good reflexes and 20 years of martial arts training and b) it was the night of my grandmother's funeral). But still, better booze than drugs, right? And, maybe some Marijuana, but everyone figured it at least kept them mellow.\n\nThree years ago my parents were visiting us - we live far from the rest of the family. One of my aunts called.  D was in the hospital - drug overdose. For the first time in 20 years, D had had some actual disposable income - more than just living paycheque to paycheque with no real cushion. LITERALLY the first thing D did? Heroin... only it's been 20 years, and Fentinol is a thing now. D lived, but that was the day I learned that addiction? Most people fight it forever. And 'Clean' is not 'sober' and 'straight' is often a matter of degree. \n\nDo I think OP is a little overboard? Yeah, probably. Do I think after six years of lying, stealing, ODs, jail, and all the associated s\\*\\*\\* that OP has exactly ZERO trust left? Yeah, absolutely. Do I think OP has a LOT more to lose, and a lot more to protect, then when they were all teens? Oh yes. \n\nTrust, but verify. Restrictions can be relaxed - broken trust is harder to restore, and broken hearts even harder.", " \n\nOur mother thinks we are being too harsh, and punishing her for her past, but I think we are just being careful.", "Drug addicts are unpredictable, and I don't want him hurting her.", "Two years is nothing.

You probably just want to be able to protect yourself from being hurt. This is understandable, but you need to at least give him some credit for what he has done.\n\nI have had multiple addicts in my family and a few friends so I know what it is like to see someone go through that. Seeing them steal from family, break your trust over and over, it is sad and frustrating to see. However, you need to realize that you are having rules based off of when he was in the depths of addiction, not him being a recovering addict who has done well in recovery.\n\nAlthough it does not seem like it at the time, addicts hurting family hurts them as well. They lose the relationships due to their own actions and it hurts, but they understand it. Do you think your brother would jump through these hoops to be around you all if he did not love you? If he did not miss your relationship.\n\nPlease, for you, for him, and for your family, you need to reconsider your stance, because it is not fair or good for anyone.\n\nYTA", "You know he used to be a drug addict. But out of the two, you are a far worse person than he could ever be. Fucking asshole, hope he cuts you out and so does your family.", "You're a crappy, selfish and genuinely mean person. Get over yourself. You failed as a sister and as a human being altogether.", "That's bot who he is, that's who he was. And you treating him like that is not going to help him stay on the straight and narrow.", "This made me feel so sad for him. His addiction isn\u2019t who he is, it\u2019s a battle he fought. He is still a person with aspirations and goals and values. He\u2019s so much more than his addiction. And until you can see it that way, you\u2019re more toxic than you realize", "He's been clean for 2 years OP.\n\nObviously, you don't trust him. You don't trust the change he put himself through.\n\nIf that's the case, don't have a relationship with him. It's unfair to him to keep treating him like a suspect than who he is", "This kind of attitude is part of why so many addicts struggle in recovery. This isn\u2019t normal healthy boundary behavior, this is stigmatizing behavior. Shame on you.", "This.\n\nThis is why you are an asshole. You would be better leaving your brother alone.", "Addicts are not their addiction, how would you like it if someone simplified your entire character and personhood into just being a mother because \"that's what you are\"? How would you like it if someone took all of your accomplishments, achievements, hardships, trauma, just everything that makes you who you are and crammed them all into a little locked box labeled \"mother\" and said this is what you are. There's a whole lot more to you inside that box, but you never ever get past the label on it.", "YTA\n\nAll your rules say way more about the type of person YOU are than the person he is.  Was.  The type of person he was.  It appears he's accepted his past mistakes and is trying to be better.  You should give it a try."]}
