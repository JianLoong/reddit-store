{"id": 5405, "submission_id": "zsvs6j", "title": "AITA for celebrating Persian holidays?", "selftext": "Hi guys. My gf's family are giving us a really hard time for this so I wanted to ask the internet.\n\nI (28F) live in the US but I'm Persian. I was born and raised in Iran until I was 18. So I feel very strongly about the traditions and holidays that I used to celebrate there. \n\nI have been dating my girlfriend (27F) for the past two years. She is an American and she has come to terms with the idea that I celebrate Persian holidays like Norooz, Yalda etc. It was a little bit surprising at first but once I explained everything, it was not a problem for her. She even likes them and sometimes celebrates with me.\n\nSo yesterday, was the longest night of the year, which is simply called Yalda. It is a night we celebrate with friends and family. We just gather in a relative's house, eat pomegranate and watermelons, read Hafez and celebrate being together. There's nothing crazy involved.\n\nI had prepared a small table for the evening, kind of sad that I couldn't be with my family this year (my parents are back home for a visit). But I set up a table anyways. When I came home at night, I saw that my gf's family had showed up (her parents and siblings) and I learnt that she had invited them so I would have people to celebrate Yalda with given that my parents were away this year.\n\nI was of course, pleasantly surprised. During dinner, my gf's brother said that it was ridiculous that I was sticking to an 'insignificant tradition' that didn't even make any sense. He asked how eating a specific kind of food could make a tradition and told my gf that she could have said she was just inviting them over for dinner and save him all the BS. Her parents also said that they didn't really care that this night was special in some part of the world.\n\nLater in night, they saw my Hafez book and asked me about it. I explained it is used to do a Hafez reading since it's part of the tradition ( you just randomly open a page of his book and read the poem that comes up. It's nothing specific it's meant to give inspiration and hope and a reason to read poems overnight). Which again, they thought was absolutely ridiculous. I offered to explain the reason for the celebration but they said it just wasn't necessary. \n\nSo for all of today, they have been posting about yesterday on their social media and I have gotten texts from extended family (aunts uncles etc) of my gf that what I do is an AH move and that since I live in America with my gf, I should stop involving her extended family in my bs. \n\nAITA for celebrating Persian holidays?", "created_utc": 1671740421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsvs6j/aita_for_celebrating_persian_holidays/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here in America we celebrate stupid holidays all the time with certain types of food, Valentine's Day and chocolate? I can list more if necessary, but I don't think it is. They're being racist, and they don't sound like that great of a family, I certainly wouldn't want to be involved with them. I think it's amazing that you are sharing your heritage, and inviting people to be part of something that is so important to you. Literally the First Amendment to our constitution is freedom of religion, and yet, they are trying to tell you that you should just let yours go because you're not in your country. That's not how this country is supposed to work. I'm so sorry to hear that they did that to you. It sounds like your girlfriend is open to what you believe in and celebrate, but is she standing up for you? Did she tell them that what they're saying and doing is rude and inappropriate? You're not the a******. My family celebrates christmas, but to be honest, winter solstice, or as you celebrate it, yalda, means far more to me. It's the breaking of the back of winter, it's when we enter into a new cycle of life, I think your tradition is beautiful. Don't let anybody shut you down.", "NTA , that\u2019s really crappy of them to insult your traditions, are they always assholes?", "No, you're not the AH. Your g/f should have explained what she was inviting her family to when she invited them. They then could have accepted or refused her invitation, knowing what it meant to you.", "NTA. \n\nListen. If my significant other was gracious enough to have my family over for an important event in her life. I would make sure they were on their best behavior, and kick them out of they weren't. \n\n*You* prepared a place at *your* table for *them*. How dare they come over just turn up their nose at it?

They sound like the people who think the U.S.A. is not a country whose majority population are immigrants or descendants of same.  Nowrooz and Yalda are the traditions that Western traditions claim as their own, like renaming the spring festival as \"Easter\" and turning the solstice into a day in Christian advent.  It all goes back to the foundations of state-supported Christianity and writing the Bible down in the Roman Empire based in Constantinople in the 300's, not today's Rome in Italy.  Constantinople was a key port city on the Western end of the Silk Road, and was full of people who celebrated solstices in different ways, and the Western Europeans (my ancestors) just glommed their own ideas onto the far more civilized ones from the East, slapped new labels on them, and called them \"Christian\" and \"European\".  Feel free to send them to me.  I trained as a pastor and then moved on to history and teach courses on such things, and I also have no tolerance for American bigotry of this sort.  My students learn Hafez poetry and one of his poems is on my office door in a midwestern American public university.

It just happens on the Winter Solstice, which many cultures also celebrate.

Your girlfriend asked them to participate in the hopes it would make you less lonely for not having your family there. You're most likely getting this much nonsense from them because they aren't happy that your girlfriend has accepted your culture and participated in holidays with you. \n\nYou didn't force anyone to do anything.

The fact that your traditions are different doesn\u2019t make them lesser. \n\nIf your girlfriend hasn\u2019t apologized for her family\u2019s reaction, given them a stern talking to, and made sure to let you know that you don\u2019t have to be exposed to that kind of bigotry again, then it\u2019s time to end the relationship. If she\u2019s not going to stand against their bigotry, then she\u2019s all for it.", "NTA. These are the same people who probably get on people's asses for saying \"Happy Holidays\", so, grade a assholes. Behavior like theirs is why I am a Pagan.", "NTA\nI am sorry. Your GFs family is a bunch of jerks. Celebrate your holidays. Heck invite me. Sounds awesome :)", "NTA. They are so very disrespectful and bigoted. And did your GF not call them on their rudeness?", "What on earth?! I feel outraged for you a million times NTA but wow her family is a piece of work and that's putting it politely. If course you should celebrate your holidays, I wish I could join you (in the UK so it's not going to happen but still, sounds cool). Keep celebrating!", "NTA. How unnecessarily mean and cruel of them. I have never heard of this holiday, but it sounds absolutely lovely and beautiful. I\u2019m so happy your girlfriend was supportive and that you don\u2019t have to now deal with considering breaking up if she had potentially taken their \u201cside.\u201d They suck so much. Thank you for keeping your traditions alive and for exposing people like me, a normal AF white woman from NY (who happens to hate all American commercialized holidays) to something new to me and wonderful to learn about.", "Sooo NTA!\n\nI'm an American who's lived abroad for the past 12 years, and (until this year) I've continued to celebrate Thanksgiving every year!\n\nPeople who've never left their home country simply can't understand how much these things mean-- but that certainly does not excuse their horrible, insulting behaviour!\n\nYou hold on to your traditions for as long as they bring you joy, and I hope you find people who can share in that joy.", "NTA- I would've been excited if a friend invited to participate in their traditions. Gf's family sucks, don't invite them again but keep your holidays, don't change them for anybody!", "NTA what awful people your GF is related to. I hope she was defending you and not just sitting idly by while all this was being said.", "OP.  I\u2019m sorry you were not able to celebrate with family or in a manner that would have been more meaningful.  It\u2019s too bad your girlfriend didn\u2019t prep them better and explain things so they were better prepared with appropriate questions instead of insulting your tradition.  You do you.  You don\u2019t have to give up customs or traditions just because they seem insignificant to others.  Your guests were j silting in many ways and your girlfriend should be ashamed for her family.  This is just plain wrong", "NTA. They should be (but probably won't be) ashamed of themselves. Also, I'm jealous that you have a holiday where you get to eat watermelon and pomegranate as part of the celebration. It sounds lovely. \n\nYou \\*should\\* exclude your GF's family from your celebrations, but not to save them the BS. To respect yourself and enjoy yourself.", "NTA. My ancestors were German/Dutch. I am talking something like 6-8 generations ago. My family still follows certain traditions like eating pork and sauerkraut on New Year's Day. Why? Who cares why. If my .00000001% German self and still follow traditions, you who actually is Persian can certainly follow Persian traditions..", "NTA. Who gets offended by a solstice party?", "NTA. Your girlfriend's family are horrible and racist.", "NTA", ">He asked how eating a specific kind of food could make a tradition\n\nAll him how the fuck did turkey become synonymous with Thanksgiving?\n\n\nNT\n\nAlso, you didn't involve her family, she did. Which I thought was sweet.", "Obviously you are not an asshole how could seriously be?", "This is the second post like this I\u2019ve read today. What had happened to common courtesy. If someone invites you into their home, they should be treated with gratitude and politeness. What kind of ignorant assholes are we raising in this country!", "Its such a disgusting response to being invited to celebrate with someone, and the fact that they're comfortable saying this on social media says that their social circle is also bigoted.\n\nAlso it makes perfect sense as a tradition. Its the darkest, longest night of the year and its cold. Gathering for warmth and comfort on it is nearly universal.", "Hey you are welcome to celebrate any tradition you want to. And I can assure you that Persians would be proud and thrilled to know you're celebrating their several thousand-year old tradition with them. We love these kinds of gestures \ud83d\ude05\n\nEdit to give you some context: Ancient Persians worshipped Mithra (also called Mehr - goddess of light and the sun), and believed that the longest night of the year could be malicious since darkness was considered to be the for of sunlight and the goddess of the sun. So they gathered together with their loved ones, celsbrated through the night to make it through. They simply considered this night the rebirth of Mithra (the goddess of son) since days got longer afterwards", "Thank you for the solidarity.\n\nI feel like I should say this: The current regime does NOT in any way represent the Iranian people. It is called the Islamic republic and what it has done best for the past 43 years is to imprison, kill and oppress the Iranian people and their culture with religious ideologies. \n\nThey have murdered hundreds of people in the streets over the past 3 months alone. We have nothing to do with these wicked sick people.", "Don't forget \"5 de mayo\". For some damn reason Americans celebrate a battle that we don't really give so much thought in Mexico \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nIndependence was in September", "> Veteran's Day\n\nThis one is double twisted, because 11/11 is **Armistice** day, marking the end of WWI, pretty much everywhere else. It's so frustrating to see a very generic holiday override a very specific memorial of the end of _a war that the US actually fought in_.", "Groundhog Day. Arbor Day. Sweetest Day.", "Her family are horrible, I'm so sorry. Plenty of Americans celebrate the Solstice for a number of reasons and the Persian traditions in particular are lovely.", "Oh no, I'm so sorry. I've been covering some of it for work and its horrifying, I can't imagine how much worse it is to be directly connected. I hope you parents are OK, and all your other family and friends too.", "It's an excuse to drink beer. Seriously. It's one of the top five biggest holidays for sales of alcohol", "Mexican here, and you have no idea how much disgusts me every time people come to me and ask \"Is cinco di maio Mexico's independence day\"?  The freaking date is only celebrated in ONE state in the entire country hahahaha", "I don\u2019t see why that\u2019s so twisted. Veterans\u2019 Day used to be called Armistice Day until after WWII, when veterans of that war proposed it be renamed to honor all veterans rather than just WWI veterans. \n\nThe comment you replied to specifically calls out July 4th as a holiday that really only honors a subset of Americans (and I don\u2019t necessarily disagree). So why is Veterans\u2019 Day being more inclusive a bad thing only in that case?", "Thank you for your empathy. It truly means a lot. These are surely very difficult times for anyone who values human lives.", "Beer, the food of choice for most American holidays."]}
