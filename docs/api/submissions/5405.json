{"id": 5405, "submission_id": "zsvs6j", "title": "AITA for celebrating Persian holidays?", "selftext": "Hi guys. My gf's family are giving us a really hard time for this so I wanted to ask the internet.\n\nI (28F) live in the US but I'm Persian. I was born and raised in Iran until I was 18. So I feel very strongly about the traditions and holidays that I used to celebrate there. \n\nI have been dating my girlfriend (27F) for the past two years. She is an American and she has come to terms with the idea that I celebrate Persian holidays like Norooz, Yalda etc. It was a little bit surprising at first but once I explained everything, it was not a problem for her. She even likes them and sometimes celebrates with me.\n\nSo yesterday, was the longest night of the year, which is simply called Yalda. It is a night we celebrate with friends and family. We just gather in a relative's house, eat pomegranate and watermelons, read Hafez and celebrate being together. There's nothing crazy involved.\n\nI had prepared a small table for the evening, kind of sad that I couldn't be with my family this year (my parents are back home for a visit). But I set up a table anyways. When I came home at night, I saw that my gf's family had showed up (her parents and siblings) and I learnt that she had invited them so I would have people to celebrate Yalda with given that my parents were away this year.\n\nI was of course, pleasantly surprised. During dinner, my gf's brother said that it was ridiculous that I was sticking to an 'insignificant tradition' that didn't even make any sense. He asked how eating a specific kind of food could make a tradition and told my gf that she could have said she was just inviting them over for dinner and save him all the BS. Her parents also said that they didn't really care that this night was special in some part of the world.\n\nLater in night, they saw my Hafez book and asked me about it. I explained it is used to do a Hafez reading since it's part of the tradition ( you just randomly open a page of his book and read the poem that comes up. It's nothing specific it's meant to give inspiration and hope and a reason to read poems overnight). Which again, they thought was absolutely ridiculous. I offered to explain the reason for the celebration but they said it just wasn't necessary. \n\nSo for all of today, they have been posting about yesterday on their social media and I have gotten texts from extended family (aunts uncles etc) of my gf that what I do is an AH move and that since I live in America with my gf, I should stop involving her extended family in my bs. \n\nAITA for celebrating Persian holidays?", "created_utc": 1671740421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsvs6j/aita_for_celebrating_persian_holidays/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here in America we celebrate stupid holidays all the time with certain types of food, Valentine's Day and chocolate? I can list more if necessary, but I don't think it is. They're being racist, and they don't sound like that great of a family, I certainly wouldn't want to be involved with them. I think it's amazing that you are sharing your heritage, and inviting people to be part of something that is so important to you. Literally the First Amendment to our constitution is freedom of religion, and yet, they are trying to tell you that you should just let yours go because you're not in your country. That's not how this country is supposed to work. I'm so sorry to hear that they did that to you. It sounds like your girlfriend is open to what you believe in and celebrate, but is she standing up for you? Did she tell them that what they're saying and doing is rude and inappropriate? You're not the a******. My family celebrates christmas, but to be honest, winter solstice, or as you celebrate it, yalda, means far more to me. It's the breaking of the back of winter, it's when we enter into a new cycle of life, I think your tradition is beautiful. Don't let anybody shut you down.", "NTA , that\u2019s really crappy of them to insult your traditions, are they always assholes?", "No, you're not the AH. Your g/f should have explained what she was inviting her family to when she invited them. They then could have accepted or refused her invitation, knowing what it meant to you.", "NTA. \n\nListen. If my significant other was gracious enough to have my family over for an important event in her life. I would make sure they were on their best behavior, and kick them out of they weren't. \n\n*You* prepared a place at *your* table for *them*. How dare they come over just turn up their nose at it? If they didn't care about Yalda, they could have stayed home.\n\nHope you have a better Yalda next year!", "I am so sorry they assaulted you with their ignorance and bigotry.  They sound like the people who think the U.S.A. is not a country whose majority population are immigrants or descendants of same.  Nowrooz and Yalda are the traditions that Western traditions claim as their own, like renaming the spring festival as \"Easter\" and turning the solstice into a day in Christian advent.  It all goes back to the foundations of state-supported Christianity and writing the Bible down in the Roman Empire based in Constantinople in the 300's, not today's Rome in Italy.  Constantinople was a key port city on the Western end of the Silk Road, and was full of people who celebrated solstices in different ways, and the Western Europeans (my ancestors) just glommed their own ideas onto the far more civilized ones from the East, slapped new labels on them, and called them \"Christian\" and \"European\".  Feel free to send them to me.  I trained as a pastor and then moved on to history and teach courses on such things, and I also have no tolerance for American bigotry of this sort.  My students learn Hafez poetry and one of his poems is on my office door in a midwestern American public university.

Your girlfriend was legit wonderful for trying, but her family are assholes all the way around. Your celebrations and traditions matter.

It literally sounds exactly like how thanksgiving is treated, everyone gathers around specific, traditional foods to share what they are grateful for in the past year and be together. It just happens on the Winter Solstice, which many cultures also celebrate. It was sweet of your gf to try to bring you the day you were missing, and I'm sorry her family is a bunch of racists who ruined it for you.", "NTA, and what they did was very disrespectful to you.

Your girlfriend asked them to participate in the hopes it would make you less lonely for not having your family there. You're most likely getting this much nonsense from them because they aren't happy that your girlfriend has accepted your culture and participated in holidays with you. \n\nYou didn't force anyone to do anything.
