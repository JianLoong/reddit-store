{"id": 5405, "submission_id": "zsvs6j", "title": "AITA for celebrating Persian holidays?", "selftext": "Hi guys. My gf's family are giving us a really hard time for this so I wanted to ask the internet.\n\nI (28F) live in the US but I'm Persian. I was born and raised in Iran until I was 18. So I feel very strongly about the traditions and holidays that I used to celebrate there. \n\nI have been dating my girlfriend (27F) for the past two years. She is an American and she has come to terms with the idea that I celebrate Persian holidays like Norooz, Yalda etc. It was a little bit surprising at first but once I explained everything, it was not a problem for her. She even likes them and sometimes celebrates with me.\n\nSo yesterday, was the longest night of the year, which is simply called Yalda. It is a night we celebrate with friends and family. We just gather in a relative's house, eat pomegranate and watermelons, read Hafez and celebrate being together. There's nothing crazy involved.\n\nI had prepared a small table for the evening, kind of sad that I couldn't be with my family this year (my parents are back home for a visit). But I set up a table anyways. When I came home at night, I saw that my gf's family had showed up (her parents and siblings) and I learnt that she had invited them so I would have people to celebrate Yalda with given that my parents were away this year. She even put on some Persian music honouring the night for when I came in.\n\nI was of course, pleasantly surprised. During dinner, my gf's brother said that it was ridiculous that I was sticking to an 'insignificant tradition' that didn't even make any sense. He asked how eating a specific kind of food could make a tradition and told my gf that she could have said she was just inviting them over for dinner and save him all the BS. Her parents also said that they didn't really care that this night was special in some part of the world.\n\nLater in night, they saw my Hafez book and asked me about it. I explained it is used to do a Hafez reading since it's part of the tradition ( you just randomly open a page of his book and read the poem that comes up. It's nothing specific it's meant to give inspiration and hope and a reason to read poems overnight). Which again, they thought was absolutely ridiculous. I offered to explain the reason for the celebration but they said it just wasn't necessary. \n\nSo for all of today, they have been posting about yesterday on their social media and I have gotten texts from extended family (aunts uncles etc) of my gf that what I do is an AH move and that since I live in America with my gf, I should stop involving her extended family in my bs. They are usually pretty decent people and they never had a problem with me. I don't know what we did to get this extreme reaction out of them.\n\nAITA for celebrating Persian holidays?\n\nEdit:  As for my gf, she was visibly upset. She told them to quit it a few times and was prepared to get into a full-blown fight but I kind of stepped in and lightened the situation by changing the subject. She apologised over and over once they left.", "created_utc": 1671740421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsvs6j/aita_for_celebrating_persian_holidays/", "score": 555, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here in America we celebrate stupid holidays all the time with certain types of food, Valentine's Day and chocolate? I can list more if necessary, but I don't think it is. They're being racist, and they don't sound like that great of a family, I certainly wouldn't want to be involved with them. I think it's amazing that you are sharing your heritage, and inviting people to be part of something that is so important to you. Literally the First Amendment to our constitution is freedom of religion, and yet, they are trying to tell you that you should just let yours go because you're not in your country. That's not how this country is supposed to work. I'm so sorry to hear that they did that to you. It sounds like your girlfriend is open to what you believe in and celebrate, but is she standing up for you? Did she tell them that what they're saying and doing is rude and inappropriate? You're not the a******. My family celebrates christmas, but to be honest, winter solstice, or as you celebrate it, yalda, means far more to me. It's the breaking of the back of winter, it's when we enter into a new cycle of life, I think your tradition is beautiful. Don't let anybody shut you down.", "NTA , that\u2019s really crappy of them to insult your traditions, are they always assholes?", "No, you're not the AH.

They sound like the people who think the U.S.A. is not a country whose majority population are immigrants or descendants of same.  Nowrooz and Yalda are the traditions that Western traditions claim as their own, like renaming the spring festival as \"Easter\" and turning the solstice into a day in Christian advent.  It all goes back to the foundations of state-supported Christianity and writing the Bible down in the Roman Empire based in Constantinople in the 300's, not today's Rome in Italy.  Constantinople was a key port city on the Western end of the Silk Road, and was full of people who celebrated solstices in different ways, and the Western Europeans (my ancestors) just glommed their own ideas onto the far more civilized ones from the East, slapped new labels on them, and called them \"Christian\" and \"European\".  Feel free to send them to me.  I trained as a pastor and then moved on to history and teach courses on such things, and I also have no tolerance for American bigotry of this sort.  My students learn Hafez poetry and one of his poems is on my office door in a midwestern American public university.

Your girlfriend asked them to participate in the hopes it would make you less lonely for not having your family there. You're most likely getting this much nonsense from them because they aren't happy that your girlfriend has accepted your culture and participated in holidays with you. \n\nYou didn't force anyone to do anything.

Her family is crass.", "NTA - You have an incredibly supportive gf btw she really does love you and you celebrating your heritage and traditions shouldn't be a problem specially since you aren't hurting anybody. Your Gf's family just sucks and sounds entitled af. Also sounds like some We ArE in AmErIcA SpeAk EngliSh bs to me. Pay them no mind and keep celebrating happily without them.", "You and your gf sounds like lovely people and the tradition you described sounds amazing. \n\nNTA.", "OP, you and your girlfriend sound lovely. It was very sweet of her to try to make Yalda special. I sorry her family lost their dang minds! You are clearly NTA.", "NTA.  \nYeah. I've never heard of any of those holidays.\nThe pomegranate and watermelon part sounds pretty solid. As for Hafez (Google is my friend), I'm not huge into poetry, but I'd be curious.  \nIt's an awful close minded approach to someone else's traditions. Even if they didn't enjoy it, it should've been approached with an open mind\nNo. You cannot be the a-hole for celebrating your culture's traditions. \nHow can eating a specific kind of food make a tradition, asked the kid that probably eats turkey and cranberry sauce every Christmas. Somebody needs to tell your gf that her brother is a dolt.  \nAnd I don't think that reading poetry is any different than singing Christmas carols. My god, do any of these people think things through before they speak?", "NTA they are racist, simple as that", "NTA", "NTA. Your girlfriend's family are ignorant xenophobes. They probably think putting mayonnaise on French fries is \"exotic.\"\n\nYour relatives are probably so used to getting flack from ignorant xenophobes that they figure it's better to keep your head down, but it doesn't have to be that way.\n\nYour tradition sounds lovely. Watermelon, pomegranate, and poetry? Who wouldn't like that?", "Absolutely NTA. I am happy to hear your SO stepped in for you. Her family though is absolutely horrible people. It doesn't matter if you live in America. I am born and raised in Arkansas. Never would I be offended that you have your own traditions. The amount of toxicity amongst her family is unreal. I am so sorry their veil attitude ruined your night. Just because a traditions is from a different country does not make it unwelcome. Most of us here in America are very open and accepting to those around us. The least they could have done is be respectful then say they just don't feel they want to do it again. There is nothing wrong with being uncomfortable and not wanting to do a different traditions. However to mock someone's life style or traditions is just plain vicious. I hope your GF does not have some deep scares from living with super nasty people. May you both be blessed and have a strong, healthy relationship away from her family.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is racist and I would leave her if I was you. People in America celebrate all sorts of holidays from all sorts of places. When people come here, they bring their traditions and that's the best thing about America.", "In this thread, it is unanimously agreed that OP is Not The Asshole for celebrating Persian holidays with their girlfriend's family. Despite OP's effort, the family were rude and showed disrespect towards OP's traditions.

Don't even get me started on Christmas, that has nothing to do with Jesus, he was not born in December, and the whole commercial, materialistic bit goes against everything he taught.", "I grew up as an atheist and we had a Christmas tree in the living room every December with presents under it.  I have a friend who is an atheist and goes to Easter mass every year.  I have a Catholic friend who was a Buddha Statue in their house.  There is nothing wrong with traditions and religious symbols bringing you comfort even if you are a not a believer in the religion those traditions or symbols come from.\n\nAnd America is a melting pot of people from all over the world and there is absolutely nothing wrong with them bringing their traditions here.  I'm sorry that some American are close minded, but please understand that not all of us are.", "Good ol' Rape and Pillage day.", "I agree and disagree. I wouldn't say Christmas and New Years are useless. Corrupted, yes, but not meaningless. Kind of same with Thanksgiving simply because despite origins, it has become a holiday to celebrate family and things you're thankful for. Christmas is about seeing and celebrating with family. New Years is about starting fresh and celebrating another year of survival. They all have their corruptions, but for most people, especially certain groups of people these holidays have a lot of important meaning outside of capitalism.", "To be fair I'm down for any dubious holiday excuse to eat more tacos and drink beer or margaritas.

Coming from a Mexican who grew up in one of the areas with the densest Mexican population, we celebrate Cinco de Mayo.

What is giving me \u201cdisgust\u201d is the bashing of American holidays. It\u2019s the same as other cultures. This attitude reeks of self hate.
