Now my best friend is (obviously) someone very dear to me who I don't only share history with, but has been with me through very tough times. We raised our families together and the children (I have two and she has two) are very close.\n\nMy son and her daughter broke up and after a decent amount of time, my son started dating his actual girlfriend. I don't have anything against the girl, on the handful of occasions I met her, I believe I acted nothing but nice. I tried my best to make her feel welcome in our place, I asked a little about her interests, I politely answered her conversation attempts, I held back any mean remark I might have had, yk, generally friendly behavior.\n\nBut my son still comes at me blaming me for liking his ex more than his gf and that I wasn't acting so \"cold\" with her. Of course I wasn't. His ex wasn't just a person he happened to like, it (and still is) essentially family. I watched her grow up, I fed her and put her to sleep next to my own children, I know her house like the back of my hand, of course I like her better because I know her better. On the top of that, my daughter is very close with her. I was meeting and still meet his ex regularly, at times even without him. Not because I plan to, but since there's so many common points, I get to have more contact with her.\n\nBesides that, it's not that I'm trying to force him to make up with her. It's their decision, they're old enough to choose on their own. I told him I'm complete fine with his girlfriend, but for me she is somehow a stranger, compared to his ex which was part of the extended family. He's calling me an AH saying it's disrespectful towards his gf, but I just think he's immature and can't accept that if he cut ties with his ex, the rest of the family can't cut ties with her family.

I would hope you'd do the same in any social event, even when talking to people you don't ever expect to see again. Nothing in this really suggests you're making any effort to build a relationship with her, the woman your son may choose to marry some day.\n\n> I held back any mean remark I might have had, \n\nLike again, this isn't \"friendly.\" This is just basic manners. That you think this helps your position any is wild\n\nFriendly would be actively trying to get to know her, actively trying to have conversation with her, being warm and inviting rather than just polite and not rude, etc. You're trying to argue against just being friendly towards her. YTA", ">I held back any mean remark I might have had, yk, generally friendly behavior\n\nThis seems like a pretty low bar.

You keep defending yourself saying she\u2019s a stranger to you. Then try to fix that and work on getting to know her rather than just being \u201cnice\u201d. If your son says you\u2019re acting cold, then ask for more examples and see if you can turn it around. \n\nShrugging it off and saying, \u201cI just like your ex more\u201d, is basically not trying to be part of your son\u2019s current life, focusing on the past.

Of course you will be closer with his ex bc she is your best friend\u2019s kid and you have known her forever, but the way you talk about his new girlfriend makes it pretty clear that there are elements of this story being left out so that you don\u2019t look bad.\n\n\u201cI held back any mean remark\u201d like wtf? How can you say that and not realize you are causing an issue? You also said that you believe you acted nice, does your son have a different opinion on how you acted? From all that you\u2019ve said it seems pretty clear that you have been a problem so you wanna leave out the details your son is concerned with.\n\nYTA, good job at trying to hide it though.", "Slight YTA -  *I held back any mean remark I might have had, yk, generally friendly behavior.*\n\nYou wouldn't have mean remarks to make if you weren't judging her, yeah?  It's your sons life and not yours.", "YTA. You need to separate your feelings about your best friend's kids from your feelings about who your son is and will be dating. He is no longer dating who you prefer - get over it or your son will distance himself from you. Be actually kind to his current gf, be open and try everything you can to like her. He says you were cold and the way you write your OP, I believe him. Do better.", "This is tough.  You're naturally going to have a better relationship with the person you've known you're entire life.  There's not the awkward \"getting-to-know-you\" phase.  So the questions are:\n\n1. What exactly is your son noticing in your behavior towards his gf?\n2. Are his accusations realistic and you're just not noticing it yourself?  Or are they unrealistic due to the previous relationship throwing him off?\n3. Is his gf having issues with how she's being treated?\n\nI think number 3 is important to find out in this.  If she's okay with how you're treating her, then this just might be due to the previous relationship being different than most relationships.  If she feels uncomfortable, though, then you're not treating her right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll withhold judgement.  It's either Y T A or N T A.  Can't truly tell.

It sounds like you were half-hearted at best and cold as ice at worst.

It looks to me like you\u2019re the one who hasn\u2019t gotten over the break-up.

How MIL treated me during the dating and engagement phase has come back to bite her in my years of marriage and now in having kids of our own. She barely hears from us.

Not treating the new girlfriend the same is natural since you have no prior relationship with her. That doesn\u2019t equate to treating her coldly or badly.

Now my best friend is (obviously) someone very dear to me who I don't only share history with, but has been with me through very tough times. We raised our families together and the children (I have two and she has two) are very close.\n\nMy son and her daughter broke up and after a decent amount of time, my son started dating his actual girlfriend. I don't have anything against the girl, on the handful of occasions I met her, I believe I acted nothing but nice. I tried my best to make her feel welcome in our place, I asked a little about her interests, I politely answered her conversation attempts, I held back any mean remark I might have had, yk, generally friendly behavior.\n\nBut my son still comes at me blaming me for liking his ex more than his gf and that I wasn't acting so \"cold\" with her. Of course I wasn't. His ex wasn't just a person he happened to like, it (and still is) essentially family. I watched her grow up, I fed her and put her to sleep next to my own children, I know her house like the back of my hand, of course I like her better because I know her better. On the top of that, my daughter is very close with her. I was meeting and still meet his ex regularly, at times even without him. Not because I plan to, but since there's so many common points, I get to have more contact with her.\n\nBesides that, it's not that I'm trying to force him to make up with her. It's their decision, they're old enough to choose on their own. I told him I'm complete fine with his girlfriend, but for me she is somehow a stranger, compared to his ex which was part of the extended family. He's calling me an AH saying it's disrespectful towards his gf, but I just think he's immature and can't accept that if he cut ties with his ex, the rest of the family can't cut ties with her family. Any takes on that?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH 20% him 80% you. \n\nHe can't expect the level of friendliness or comfortability right at the jump. You don't know what people are comfortable with, what their interests are, their personality until you get to know them. It's like meeting a friend at school, the more you get to know someone, the more you might open up.\n\nHowever you have blatant, leaking, oozing favoritism. Which is wrong. The fact you have to hold back mean remarks? If she's perfectly fine and it's just you know the ex better what could possibly make you want to say something mean without provocation?! And if she did say or do something that might warrant a mean remark, I'm sure you would have told us and told him, hey your new gf did XYZ and I don't appreciate it. \n\nHow are you so ignorant you can openly recognize how much more you like the ex, how well you know her, how you know her like the back of your hand, basically raised her, and yet think you're treating them equally? Yes it's clear you're as cold as a frigid ice queen. Feel bad for the new girl bc just bc you love your son's ex, and you loved them together, it's his relationship. Stop trying to live his life based on your preferences.\n\nYou're low key giving mama boy vibes. The only girl he can date is one you love and approve of and no one else will be able to be a good enough wife except for the girl next door that the mom has known since she was a little girl and therefore is not a threat but a loving family member, but all other girls are she-wolf threats.", "No but regardless it isn't about who you like.

My dad was broken hearted when I stopped dating my ex. When I told him it was over he asked if they could still be friends and told me he still wanted to help my ex fix his screen door lol. \n\nIt definitely took some time for him to warm up to my now husband. He was never rude or cold just a bit distant compared to how he was with my ex. But he got over it quickly and now he adores my husband.", "Yeah\u2026 YIKES OP. You sound like the MIL from hell. Try harder for your son. YTA", "yep, exactly. Like, wow, you didn't say \"I actually like his ex better than you, sorry not sorry\" to her face... do you want a medal?\n\nAnd if you're sitting there, consciously having to hold back \"mean comments,\" I just don't think you're being as friendly as you think! \n\nLike, obviously she doesn't have to have the same level of feelings toward both of them when she doesn't even know the current gf, but why is she so bitter to the point where she's thinking \"mean thoughts\" to a poor woman who never did anything to her??", "As soon as I read that I decided YTA OP. Why are you thinking mean remarks about this girl you just met?

Especially if she's only meet the GF a handful of times?? OP is clearly not doing a \u201cgood job\u201d trying to hide it seeing as the son is addressing her rude behaviour. I get the impression OP is still upset over the son and best friends daughter breaking up and probably had hopes they would get married someday, then their families would really be tired together. But she needs to realize that dream is dead and she can't take it out on the next woman he dates because she's upset about them no longer being together. OP YTA", "I believe his accusations are based on his last relationship. I used to go out with my daughter and his ex, or have his ex over without him, but because we had other things in common and also THE GIRL liked me and saw in me a person to spend time with.

Cuddle her to sleep? Send her flowers periodically? Lay down a red carpet when she comes to my house?", "It's so weird to me that the son almost wants her to have an instant equal relationship she's had with the ex.

I think both of them are insecure, but I can't exactly act with his gf which I've known only for a couple months just like I've been acting with his ex where I've witnessed her birth. I'm not telling my son his ex is better or his gf is bad, it's just I had waaaaay more contact with his ex than with his actual. PLUS, he's dated the girl for 5 YEARS. This relationship had just started, there was barely the time to befriend each other.", "Okay but that\u2019s still rude, if you move on one day and find a genuine relationship that\u2019s healthy and ect.

If your son cut ties with her... wouldn't that indicate pain on his part? Would you care if she cheated on him? Or hurt him another way? So why did they break up?

How about you treat her like someone important to your son?

Her relationship with her best friend\u2019s daughter predates her son\u2019s relationship. That\u2019s not clinging to anything.

OP also notes that she has had a few interactions with the new gf where she asked her polite questions about her life and tried to make her welcome in the OP home. None of that sounds mean to me. \n\n Since none of us actually know these people or saw any of the interactions between the OP and new gf, we can only go on what is written here. From that it seems to me like the son just wants everyone to move on from his ex and love his new gf just as much, which is impossible since they all have many years (decades) of knowing and caring about the ex.   \n\nThe son seems to be expecting mom to act the same way to a person she barely knows as she did to his ex who she's known since childhood. That's unrealistic and, yes, immature.", "How is she disrespecting her? She said she seen her 4-5 times!", "I think the fact your son knows what\u2019s going on without you telling him means you\u2019re not keeping it yourself. You may  not verbally be doing it, but you\u2019re behaving in such a way.\nYou aren\u2019t expected to treat this girl like you treated his ex, and if they\u2019re so insecure maybe you shouldn\u2019t be trying to make them feel bad.", "I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from how could you not! You\u2019ve known her since birth and her mother\u2019s your best friend it\u2019s ridiculous to even think otherwise \ud83d\ude1e", "That\u2019s the thing though your not even trying to get to know her. They\u2019ve been together for months that\u2019s plenty of time to reach out to his gf to ask to go to lunch or something. Plenty of time for an opportunity to get to know her.

She\u2019s always been and will always be. \n\nHer son changed his relationship with her from family friend to romantic relationship to ex, but that doesn\u2019t mean op is just suppose to change her own relationship with someone who predated her son\u2019s relationship. He chose to date a family friend, op didn\u2019t do anything to change her own relationship with that person. \n\nWhy exactly does op have to change a familial relationship she\u2019s had with a child she watch grow up just because the son got a new girlfriend?

If she does, well then both of them should make effort to improve the relationship", "OP can't bring herself to do more than the bare minimum of human politeness; no different than how you'd treat a stranger on the street.

By saying I held back mean remarks I meant I didn't say anything to make her feel attacked by me just like the clichee states. I have absolutely nothing against the girl and I'm happy for my son, but I can't suddenly jump to being buddy-buddy with her just like I was with his ex and this is pissing him off. Then again, I don't think the poor girl wants to be THAT close to me either. After all, I'm just the mom of a guy she's dating, not the newest hotshot on campus...", "Thank you!", "I'm sorry?  Did I give the impression that OP should change her relationship with the ex?  If I did, that was no where near my intention.", "Well what do you do with his ex??\n\nEdit-Also if I cared about my boyfriend yes I\u2019d want to go to the mall with his mom.  It would be a chance to bond and get to know each other better.", "But you do with the ex and your BFF.", "So that would be a no, then.  \n\nBefore I met my wife, I dated a girl for almost 6 years.  Early on in the relationship, I stopped by her house, but she wasn't there and wasn't due back for about an hour.  Her mother invited me in to go sit on the porch with her.  We just chit-chatted for about 45 minutes (I'm not usually a talker, but she was easy to talk to).  It doesn't seem like much, but it was an awesome experience to me and let me know that she cared.  \n\n\nMy in-laws invited me nightly to play cards with them, from early on.  It's how I learned to play Spades.  Got to know them pretty well doing something like that.\n\nIt doesn't take much.

It\u2019s pure entitlement to expect the same treatment as son\u2019s brand new girlfriend as a child she helped raise. \n\nNowhere in the post does op have any hope of her son marry the ex, she literally said she they were adults who make their own decisions and she does not want them back together. She\u2019s happy for her son to date this new girl, she\u2019s just not going to love a stranger the same as the girl that\u2019s pretty much her own niece/other daughter. You\u2019re just making shit up here without any basis whatsoever.", "Oh yea, you\u2019re nasty lady. That last comment was SOOOO unnecessary.

If there\u2019s another ex that predates get best friend\u2019s daughter, that is comparable, but someone who she\u2019s known and has a positive relationship with since the person was a baby is not comparable to someone she\u2019s met 4 or 5 times in group settings. You can\u2019t compare a preexisting (and long-term) relationship with a brand new relationship (her relationship with OP is still brand new, regardless of how long she and OP\u2019s son have been together). \n\nSomeone you\u2019ve known and has a close relationship with for over 20 years will get a different treatment compared to someone you haven\u2019t even known for a year and have seen only sporadically simply because you have a longer relationship with the former. Like, you can\u2019t expect to be treated the same way your sibling-in-laws treat one another, as the relationships are different.

That's not even close to what I said.", "INFO: have you take into consideration that a potential reason why your sons ex is constantly with your family could be because she\u2019s not over him and somewhat keeping tabs? This is actually a common tactic people use when they aren\u2019t over their exs. \n\nseems like you genuinely haven\u2019t even given his girlfriend a chance. Spend actual time with his current girlfriend. Go shopping, the movies whatever works! Make a GENUINE effort to know her since she\u2019s important to your son. In the end your son comes first. I\u2019m sure you spent time with your sons ex when your son was dating her. REGARDLESS if she was a family friend beforehand. (Hypothetically speaking) if your sons ex cheated on him would you even be spending this much time with her? Would you be acting cold like this to his current girlfriend? I\u2019m the end you have to take into account how uncomfortable your son and his current gf could be feeling knowing that your actively spending time with his ex. Anyone would be uncomfortable with that."]}
