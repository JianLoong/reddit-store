My best friend (Mary) also goes there and her family owns an apartment. It has 3 bedrooms and she invited 2 friends to live w/ her (Leslie and Kevin). Last month, Leslie decided to move in with her bf of only 5 months.\n\nSo, I decided to move there already, even if I could save the money, bc Mary needed someone until the end of year and she already had others interested.\n\nI\u2019ve been living there for almost a month and Leslie relationship is already not well. So, it\u2019s kind of an uncomfortable situation for me, bc a lot of mutual friends are saying she should just leave him (she should btw), but they talk in a way, kinda assuming she\u2019ll just move back. Kevin and Mary\u2019s sister are always making comments about it as if they didn\u2019t even considered that I might not be ok with it. Mary said I don\u2019t have to share if i don\u2019t want to, and Leslie can stay w/ us as a guest until she find a place, but idk how to feel about it. \n\nSo, things you might consider: \n\n(1) the room has a double bed (which i love to sleep in) and we\u2019ll need to get rid of it and then buy two single beds.\n\n(2) i like smoking in my room and she\u2019s allergic.\n\n(3) I have shared a room with my sister all my life. When i went to college, I couldn\u2019t afford a individual room, so I shared a room with Mary\u2019s sister. Mary also lived with us during the pandemics, so it was crowded, we didn\u2019t even had a place to keep our clothes properly. So, as now I can perfectly afford to keep the room to myself I don\u2019t feel very happy about sharing again. \n\n(4) if next year came and i wanted to move there but Leslie still in the apartment, Mary wouldn\u2019t have made her leave or share her bedroom with me either.\n\n(5) Leslie did left on her on. Everyone told her that moving in with her bf of 5 months was a bad idea. Mostly because she has a broken picker and Mary and Kevin could tell something about him was off when he started visiting. They suggested she kept paying the bills for a month so she would have a \u201ctest drive\u201d, but she refused. \n\nAlso, if I didn\u2019t had moved in, probably a guy friend would\u2019ve gotten the room and they probably wouldn\u2019t even consider sharing a room with each other. Other thing is that she\u2019s not the kind that stays single for long, she\u2019s always hooking up w/ someone, nothing wrong with that, but regarding sharing a room with her\u2026 well, not the best scenario. \n\nOn the other side, Leslie is a cool girl and I really like her. She already spent money buying things to her boyfriend\u2019s house and any other place she finds will be worst than here and probably more expensive. idk maybe i\u2019m a little selfish for not sharing a room in a big ass apartment when she\u2019s probably going to find herself in a more difficult situation, obviously bc of her own choices, but even so.

But that\u2019s probably gonna be a lot more expensive, because the rents are very high in the city we live. Colleges do not have dorms where I am from, so that\u2019s not an option either.", "And do you have another option ? Would you be comfortable with her living in an unsafe place? \nYTA for not giving a sh!t about what happens to another human being. Yes, actions have consequences. But we also need to have compassion. I hope you never make a mistake.", "I don\u2019t know where you get she\u2019ll be living in a unsafe place, she would be living with other students from our college, just in a more crowded/chaotic environment, but it\u2019s the usual for student here. Also I didn\u2019t mentioned in the post, because I had to short it down, but her parents aren\u2019t like rich or something but they support her financially, like she won\u2019t be living in the streets or something like that", "As way of explanation: living with her bf seems unsafe for her, right?\nAnd if she can't afford to live in a nice place with other students then she would be forced to live in a less optimal place, making her unsafe. \nYou mentioned that as a factor but did not say it wasn't an issue because her parents would pay. Sorry I did not fill in the blanks correctly.\nIt sounds like you have made up your mind and Leslie is stuck looking for a new place and you are stuck with roommates who are going to be annoyed.", "Living with her boyfriend does seems unsafe for her, but for now, it still her choice. But I still wouldn\u2019t choose the word unsafe to describe the living situation with another students because it is the usual here, our situation is just privileged. And about the roommates, Mary is fine, she\u2019s the one saying I don\u2019t need to share the room, and you can see that I never mentioned her wanting to share her room either, even tho Leslie is a friend of hers. Kevin live in his little pink world so he\u2019s not really the kind that gets annoyed. I\u2019m more worried about looking as an asshole for the outside people."]}
