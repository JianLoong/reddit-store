{"id": 5984, "submission_id": "zyqb7s", "title": "AITA for not backing up my wife?", "selftext": " \n\nBackstory,  My wife (41F), let's call her \"Lisa\" and me (40M) have been married for  less than a year.  We also introduced each other to our families in the  past year.  Her family lives about a 7 hour drive, mine about 20  minutes, so we see my family more than hers.  This is already a point of  contention but not the point of this post.  We figured we would  alternate Holidays and for this year, my parents got Thanksgiving and  hers get Christmas.  Next year we will flip that.  But on to the story.\n\nMy  Mom absolutely loves Christmas and giving gifts.  Every year, she asks  us to make a list of things we want to help her shopping.  I get it's a  little childish for grown adults to make Christmas gift lists, but my  Mom enjoys it and it's not much effort to put some small things on the  list to appease her.\n\nSo come  Thanksgiving, we are at my parents house, socializing, watching football  (All 4 of us are football fans), and come halftime of the Lions game,  my Mom goes and gets two small pads of paper and pens and hands them to  us and tells us to make our lists as she hasn't gotten any from us yet.   My wife goes ballistic and starts yelling at my Mom about how stupid  that is and she is 41 years old and doesn't appreciate being treated  like a child.  This caught my completely off guard.  She then went on to  accuse my parents of favoring my brothers wife over her because she is  much skinnier, which is not true and has not basis at all.  My parents  have never been anything but nice to her.  Anyhow, she storms out of the  house and demands we leave.  I refuse and tell her she's making too  much of it.  She finally relents, we go back in and have a very awkward  dinner, I write a few small things on a list for my Mom and we leave.    When we get home , she blows up on me that I should have had her back  regardless if I agreed with her as that's what married couples do.   I  told her that was not reasonable.\n\nFast  forward to Christmas, we are now ate her parents house.  It comes time  for the gift exchange.  Her mother explains to me a tradition they've  always done, but I'm free to not participate if I don't want to.  The  tradition is that they draw names to see who gets to open, but before  you open you have to answer a trivia question.  If you get it right, you  open and draw the next name, if you get it wrong, you don't get to open  and draw a new name.  I tell her Mom, of course I'll play, mostly  because I want to respect their tradition and also it sounds like a lot  of fun.  My wife breaks down in tears suddenly and I'm confused.  It  turns out that this was not a tradition for them at all, but her and her  family colluded to have a childish game to try and make me participate  and I was supposed to refuse.  By agreeing to play I ruined the holiday  and they didn't even have the trivia questions ready for the game the  invented.", "created_utc": 1672372771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyqb7s/aita_for_not_backing_up_my_wife/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Figuring out who was how much of an asshole is practically besides the point, although we can certainly start with your wife.   \n\n\nFirst, a Christmas list from adults isn\u2019t even slightly childish. It\u2018s an excellent way to find out what people would really like. It\u2019s much easier to buy for a 3 year old than a 40 year old. Second, going ballistic at your mother, even if her request was slightly unreasonable (which it wasn\u2019t) was so out of hand, so disproportionate to the alleged offense that your charming bride definitely gets major TA points. You get some TA points because I do believe spouses should back each other up in front of other people, but what did she want? For you to also throw a childish temper tantrum?\n\nAnd then tears from your loony bride because you were a good sport about what they told you was a family tradition? They all get TA points for trying to get revenge on you (I assume that was the motivation for the game.) because you didn\u2019t join your wife in behaving like an overtired three year old and then claiming that you ruined Christmas by being pleasant and cooperative?\n\nGood luck to you.", "NTA- does your wife have known mental health issues?

As a side note every member of my family, even my mother and father, give me a Christmas list the week before Thanksgiving (I do all of my shopping the weekend after Thanksgiving). Anyone who doesn't give me a list before Thanksgiving Day gets a gift card. It's the best way to ensure that the people you love aren't getting a bunch of crap they don't want. Plus that way if somebody else needs a gift idea I always have one. Christmas lists are not childish they're practical.", "Wtf did I just read??

Good luck with that. ~~If this is abnormal behavior for her, I recommend seeking medical help of some sort. Because what she's doing, the way she thinks people are out to get her, is concerning and irrational.~~\n\nEdit: Nah, now that I think about it, her whole family's like her. They were in on that crazy scheme. This is just who she is finally shining through.

So are you the ah for agreeing to soem bs they made up? NTA they seem like a crappy family to marry into", "NTA. Your wife is slightly nuts. My adult children always give me lists. I give them a list.

So can her family for pulling a stupid stunt, but at least they got caught out in it.", "NTA- Your wife and family need some help. Their was nothing wrong with your mom wanting to know what you would want for Christmas. Your wife was way out of line, and I wouldn't have backed her up either. The fact that she and her family tried to trick you into doing the same thing but blaming you for not having a tantrum is ridiculous. I hope your rethinking this marriage because this is not normal.", "NTA and something is seriously wrong with your wife and her family. She threw a tantrum over nothing at your folks house and then tried to bait you and HER FAMILY PLAYED ALONG. these people are NOT NORMAL and this alone would make me run run run. Looney tunes!", "NTA - astonishing that this woman is 40+. It kinda feels to me like there are some details missing here but especially egregious is her and her family colluding to catch you out. I would personally feel very offended by this. The fact her parents felt this was reasonable sets off so many red flags about this family for me. Your mum\u2019s tradition sounds very sweet.", "NTA.  Good luck with your divorce!  Your wife appears to have been a very good actress for the beginning of your relationship, her and her family appear to be nuts.  You would be doing yourself a great disservice if you stayed with her.  Who in their right mind behaves like her & her family.\n\nEdit to add:  I see nothing childish or even wrong about what your mother does, she's actually being really considerate in trying to get you gifts that you actually want/need, rather than buying you stuff that will probably just get thrown out or regifted.", "NTA\n\nIt is not appropriate for your wife to have yelled at your mother or accused her of favoritism towards your brother's wife. It is also not appropriate for her to have stormed out of your parents' house and demanded that you leave. It is understandable that you were caught off guard and did not back her up in this situation.\n\nHowever, it is important for couples to support each other in difficult situations, even if they do not agree with each other's actions or perspectives. It is worth having a conversation with your wife about why she felt so strongly about the gift list and the perceived favoritism towards your brother's wife, and try to find a way to support each other in the future.\n\nAs for the incident at your wife's parents' house, it is not clear from the information provided what the purpose of the trivia game was or why your wife was upset about your participation. It may be helpful to have a conversation with your wife about this incident and try to understand her perspective and find a way to resolve any conflicts or misunderstandings", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
