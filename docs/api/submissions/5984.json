{"id": 5984, "submission_id": "zyqb7s", "title": "AITA for not backing up my wife?", "selftext": " \n\nBackstory,  My wife (41F), let's call her \"Lisa\" and me (40M) have been married for  less than a year.  We also introduced each other to our families in the  past year.  Her family lives about a 7 hour drive, mine about 20  minutes, so we see my family more than hers.  This is already a point of  contention but not the point of this post.  We figured we would  alternate Holidays and for this year, my parents got Thanksgiving and  hers get Christmas.  Next year we will flip that.  But on to the story.\n\nMy  Mom absolutely loves Christmas and giving gifts.  Every year, she asks  us to make a list of things we want to help her shopping.  I get it's a  little childish for grown adults to make Christmas gift lists, but my  Mom enjoys it and it's not much effort to put some small things on the  list to appease her.\n\nSo come  Thanksgiving, we are at my parents house, socializing, watching football  (All 4 of us are football fans), and come halftime of the Lions game,  my Mom goes and gets two small pads of paper and pens and hands them to  us and tells us to make our lists as she hasn't gotten any from us yet.   My wife goes ballistic and starts yelling at my Mom about how stupid  that is and she is 41 years old and doesn't appreciate being treated  like a child.  This caught my completely off guard.  She then went on to  accuse my parents of favoring my brothers wife over her because she is  much skinnier, which is not true and has not basis at all.  My parents  have never been anything but nice to her.  Anyhow, she storms out of the  house and demands we leave.  I refuse and tell her she's making too  much of it.  She finally relents, we go back in and have a very awkward  dinner, I write a few small things on a list for my Mom and we leave.    When we get home , she blows up on me that I should have had her back  regardless if I agreed with her as that's what married couples do.   I  told her that was not reasonable.\n\nFast  forward to Christmas, we are now ate her parents house.  It comes time  for the gift exchange.  Her mother explains to me a tradition they've  always done, but I'm free to not participate if I don't want to.  The  tradition is that they draw names to see who gets to open, but before  you open you have to answer a trivia question.  If you get it right, you  open and draw the next name, if you get it wrong, you don't get to open  and draw a new name.  I tell her Mom, of course I'll play, mostly  because I want to respect their tradition and also it sounds like a lot  of fun.  My wife breaks down in tears suddenly and I'm confused.  It  turns out that this was not a tradition for them at all, but her and her  family colluded to have a childish game to try and make me participate  and I was supposed to refuse.  By agreeing to play I ruined the holiday  and they didn't even have the trivia questions ready for the game the  invented.", "created_utc": 1672372771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyqb7s/aita_for_not_backing_up_my_wife/", "score": 3438, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their was nothing wrong with your mom wanting to know what you would want for Christmas. Your wife was way out of line, and I wouldn't have backed her up either.

Good luck with your divorce!  Your wife appears to have been a very good actress for the beginning of your relationship, her and her family appear to be nuts.  You would be doing yourself a great disservice if you stayed with her.  Who in their right mind behaves like her & her family.\n\nEdit to add:  I see nothing childish or even wrong about what your mother does, she's actually being really considerate in trying to get you gifts that you actually want/need, rather than buying you stuff that will probably just get thrown out or regifted.", "NTA\n\nIt is not appropriate for your wife to have yelled at your mother or accused her of favoritism towards your brother's wife. It is also not appropriate for her to have stormed out of your parents' house and demanded that you leave. It is understandable that you were caught off guard and did not back her up in this situation.\n\nHowever, it is important for couples to support each other in difficult situations, even if they do not agree with each other's actions or perspectives. It is worth having a conversation with your wife about why she felt so strongly about the gift list and the perceived favoritism towards your brother's wife, and try to find a way to support each other in the future.\n\nAs for the incident at your wife's parents' house, it is not clear from the information provided what the purpose of the trivia game was or why your wife was upset about your participation.

To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. **But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development**. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. **When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up**.\n\n\nThere's something really weird about the dynamic of your wife's family of origin if they react so strangely to things.", "This is the classic \"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes,\" and your wife is the biggest jester of them all.

You need to speak to her about how she feels about your mom, her MIL, and examples as to how she feels she's being treated. There have been times (where I am present) where I see sons and daughters be COMPLETELY blind to MILs/FILs make comments/make remarks here and there that aren't kind. Shoot, I've even seen this in relationships & once had this happen to me in a previous relationship. I'm not saying your mom did, but if your loved one is saying that they've seen this, you should at least be willing to hear her out. \n\nI also noticed that you all live much closer to your family- are they over often, or are you guys over often? Think about how often they're present & how your wife feels about it, as I've also seen some frustration about MILs/FILs being present all the time, but comes out in an outburst about other issues.\n\nEven if it is all a misunderstanding and you're right that your mom isn't like that, that needs to be addressed, because she clearly feels the MIL has been treating her unfairly, and you saying \"I don't see that\" just disregards her feelings entirely.

She shouldn't have gotten mad at you over this, and this isn't in your control OR your fault.
