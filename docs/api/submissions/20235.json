And we already know we have a trip coming up Memorial Day next year that will require us to leave our baby home with someone. \n\nI\ufe0f immediately jumped to my parents would watch the baby ( I\ufe0f did make this assumption without consulting him) and he made the assumption his parents could watch her since we\u2019d be flying out of the airport close to his parents. \n\nI\ufe0f told him logistically it didn\u2019t make sense because his parents wouldn\u2019t watch our three dogs in addition to the baby so my parents would still have to drive five hours to our house to watch our dogs (which my dad would do in a heartbeat, many times I\u2019ve had to watch him pack the car before going home because he\u2019s tried to sneak my oldest hound out with him. They adore our dogs). If my parents are going to make the drive and care for the dogs, it would be best to leave the baby in her home that she\u2019s familiar with and not tow her three hours away to his parents. \n\n\nHowever I\ufe0f did voice to him that outside the logistics I\ufe0f was also just not comfortable with his parents watching the baby. I\ufe0f don\u2019t know them well though they haven\u2019t given me any like child abuse red flag vibes, if anything his mom is too coddling. I\ufe0f told my husband that I\ufe0f recognize I\ufe0f have a bias to my parents because they raised me so I\ufe0f know how they parent, react, I\ufe0f know them as people. I\ufe0f don\u2019t have that relationship with his parents so like anyone else that I\ufe0f would want to watch their interactions with my child for a while before feeling comfortable that I\ufe0f know how they would react in certain situations and learn more about how they make decisions. Not to mention, it\u2019s questionable already how they will respect boundaries. But with time and enough interaction, I\u2019ll get to be comfortable with them watching the baby alone. \n\nMy husband is upset at this saying on the flip side he could say the same about my parents \u2014 which is totally true and fair. The only counter argument I\ufe0f have is that they\u2019ve shown much more interest and willingness to compromise when it comes to our dogs than his parents. Both of our parents have dogs so it\u2019s not about one liking dogs and the other not. \n\nSo the question lies, AITA setting the expectation that my in laws have to essentially earn my trust before watching our child?\n\nEDIT: okay I\ufe0f realized I\ufe0f forgot to specify why the trust isn\u2019t there: \n\n1. They have two small dogs that bite and aren\u2019t potty trained so they poop/pets where ever they want \n\n2. It\u2019s pretty rural so medical help is a minimum 25 minute drive \n\n3. His dad isn\u2019t Covid vaccinated\n\nBut otherwise they are very nice and kind!\n\n\nEDIT 2: I\ufe0f accept the asshole verdict. I\ufe0f definitely should have put more details into the current status of the relationship with my in laws. \n\nI\ufe0f will reopen this conversation with my husband and show him this post to discuss the comments.", "created_utc": 1687353824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f7o90/aita_telling_my_husband_its_going_to_be_years/", "score": 2422, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When they come to visit after the birth, start by asking his mom and dad how they feel about watching the baby. Tell her it\u2019s perfectly OK to be honest.

If your husband\u2019s parents are not taking the virus seriously, what else are they not taking seriously?  Many people who won\u2019t get vaccinated engage in higher risk behaviors such as not masking up when they themselves have symptoms and not washing their hands as much.  I live in a rural area and I see this firsthand all the time.  In fact, if you wear a mask because you have symptoms, you can get harassed for it.  On that basis alone, you should argue for your parents to be the caretakers because this could be a life threatening issue. If FIL wants to start getting the vaccines, cool.

I\ufe0f don\u2019t have that relationship with his parents so like anyone else that I\ufe0f would want to watch their interactions with my child for a while before feeling comfortable that I\ufe0f know how they would react in certain situations and learn more about how they make decisions.

You are unconsciously coming from a place of \"this is** ***my*** **baby\". It's your husband's baby too. You do not (so far, from what you've indicated) have good reason to expect that his parents will be anything but perfectly competent caregivers. After all, they successfully raised a person already who you liked enough to marry. I know that's not always determinative - plenty of good people have crap parents - but you don't have sufficient evidence of crappiness.\\]**\n\n>My husband is upset at this saying on the flip side he could say the same about my parents \u2014 which is totally true and fair. The only counter argument I\ufe0f have is that they\u2019ve shown much more interest and willingness to compromise when it comes to our dogs than his parents. Both of our parents have dogs so it\u2019s not about one liking dogs and the other not.\n\n**\\[Irrelevant. How his parents handle requests to dog sit is completely different. In laws are not the grandparents of your dogs. They** ***are*** **the grandparents of your kid. Unless they've acted in a way that indicates otherwise, it's not at all unreasonable for folks to think \"I care about my grandkid, I don't care that much about my kid's dog(s).\\]**\n\n>So the question lies, AITA setting the expectation that my in laws have to essentially earn my trust before watching our child?  \n>  \n>EDIT: okay I\ufe0f realized I\ufe0f forgot to specify why the trust isn\u2019t there:  \n>  \n>They have two small dogs that bite and aren\u2019t potty trained so they poop/pets where ever they want\n\n**\\[The correct response to this is to ask them to ensure that the dogs aren't around your child unsupervised. Until they show you otherwise, it would be unfair to assume that they won't be good babysitters. Your child getting bit more than once (once happens, and in a vacuum does not indicate negligence) would be reason to re-evaluate your trust later. The hypothetical alone does not justify setting your default trust so low to begin with. If they were pitbulls this might be different, but you indicated small dogs.\\]**\n\n>It\u2019s pretty rural so medical help is a minimum 25 minute drive\n\n**\\[Many people live much further away than this from medical care. Unless your child has unique medical needs (deadly allergies to common things, diabetes, etc.), this is not a reason to deny his parents overnight babysitting. Otherwise we'd get to make the same call about all folks who don't live near hospitals, including to the extent that you could make a moral judgment about rural people who decide to have their own kids. This cannot be the standard.\\]**\n\n>His dad isn\u2019t Covid vaccinated\n\n**\\[EDITED AFTER READING COMMENTS: Initially I was more sympathetic to this. However, evidence provided in comments suggests that the vaccines - while important to public health because they result in the sufferer getting less sick and therefore taking less resources - do not reduce viral shedding and therefore do not reduce transmission. FIL not being vaccinated - while foolish - does not reduce your child's likelihood of catching it from him. Earlier in the pandemic it would** ***also*** **be potential evidence that FIL was not likely to isolate and therefore more likely to** ***get*** **COVID. But at this point nobody is isolating. Your parents and his parents therefore have the exact same chance of giving your child COVID. In fact, his parents might have a slightly lower chance since they live in a rural area and probably have fewer close contacts. I'm onboard with being a bit careful with how much time your child has with a person with unscientific conspiratorial views - if that is how your FIL is (and not just lazy or uninformed). However, I don't see that as alone enough to say \"it's going to be years before I trust your parents to watch our son\". So, unless one of his parents is recently or currently showing symptoms, or has a close contact with COVID, then this is not a reason to deny them the ability to babysit. To be fair, if you took the position that** ***nobody*** **should be around your son until your son is vaccinated himself, so as to improve his outcome if he gets it, then - while I think this would be excessive - it would at least be fair and not privilege your parents over his.\\]**\n\nIn summary: YTA. Not for the trip next year, since your logistics reasons make sense. Your husband should agree to ask your parents first for that trip. However, you're the asshole for a) operating on the likely unconscious/subconscious assumption that the baby is *yours* more than your husband's and therefore you have the final say, and b) for taking the position that your husband's parents need to earn trust instead of being granted it subject to future behaviour. Nothing in your post indicates that the starting trust level should be this low. Of course, their behaviour could reasonably change your trust level going forward, but starting so low puts you on a bad foot with them and bodes poorly for your relationship with your husband.\n\n*If* the logistics didn't make your parents the obvious choice, then my suggestion would be to wait and see and then pick closer to the date. Simply telling your husband \"let's wait and see who is more available, willing, and capable 6 months from now\" sounds completely reasonable, and still gives you 6 months to plan ahead. It would also be reasonable to demand a COVID test beforehand - so long as you'd apply the same standard to your parents.\n\nI saw your edits about the verdict, and good for you for taking this criticism constructively.", "NTA.

I am not an anti vaxer or a conspiracy theorist and I will likely end up getting the vaccine sooner or later, because why not. When the vaccine first came out I was a little skeptical and afraid because I thought it was thrown together too quickly, and I was afraid of possible unknown side effects because I felt there wasn't enough time for the scientists making these vaccines to study the side effects.\n\n  After doing my own research on how the vaccines are actually made and the fact that everyone I know has been fully vaccinated for years and nothing has happened to them yet.

I have had strep, I have had the flu, I have had pneumonia, we have had ear infections. No COVID as of yet or RSV and I am counting our blessings for that. \n\n   Also if you and your family are fully vaccinated I am unsure of how someone else's choice not to be puts your family at risk.
