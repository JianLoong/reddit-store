And we already know we have a trip coming up Memorial Day next year that will require us to leave our baby home with someone. \n\nI\ufe0f immediately jumped to my parents would watch the baby ( I\ufe0f did make this assumption without consulting him) and he made the assumption his parents could watch her since we\u2019d be flying out of the airport close to his parents. \n\nI\ufe0f told him logistically it didn\u2019t make sense because his parents wouldn\u2019t watch our three dogs in addition to the baby so my parents would still have to drive five hours to our house to watch our dogs (which my dad would do in a heartbeat, many times I\u2019ve had to watch him pack the car before going home because he\u2019s tried to sneak my oldest hound out with him. They adore our dogs). If my parents are going to make the drive and care for the dogs, it would be best to leave the baby in her home that she\u2019s familiar with and not tow her three hours away to his parents. \n\n\nHowever I\ufe0f did voice to him that outside the logistics I\ufe0f was also just not comfortable with his parents watching the baby. I\ufe0f don\u2019t know them well though they haven\u2019t given me any like child abuse red flag vibes, if anything his mom is too coddling. I\ufe0f told my husband that I\ufe0f recognize I\ufe0f have a bias to my parents because they raised me so I\ufe0f know how they parent, react, I\ufe0f know them as people. I\ufe0f don\u2019t have that relationship with his parents so like anyone else that I\ufe0f would want to watch their interactions with my child for a while before feeling comfortable that I\ufe0f know how they would react in certain situations and learn more about how they make decisions. Not to mention, it\u2019s questionable already how they will respect boundaries. But with time and enough interaction, I\u2019ll get to be comfortable with them watching the baby alone. \n\nMy husband is upset at this saying on the flip side he could say the same about my parents \u2014 which is totally true and fair. The only counter argument I\ufe0f have is that they\u2019ve shown much more interest and willingness to compromise when it comes to our dogs than his parents. Both of our parents have dogs so it\u2019s not about one liking dogs and the other not. \n\nSo the question lies, AITA setting the expectation that my in laws have to essentially earn my trust before watching our child?\n\nEDIT: okay I\ufe0f realized I\ufe0f forgot to specify why the trust isn\u2019t there: \n\n1. They have two small dogs that bite and aren\u2019t potty trained so they poop/pets where ever they want \n\n2. It\u2019s pretty rural so medical help is a minimum 25 minute drive \n\n3. His dad isn\u2019t Covid vaccinated\n\nBut otherwise they are very nice and kind!\n\n\nEDIT 2: I\ufe0f accept the asshole verdict. I\ufe0f definitely should have put more details into the current status of the relationship with my in laws. \n\nI\ufe0f will reopen this conversation with my husband and show him this post to discuss the comments.", "created_utc": 1687353824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f7o90/aita_telling_my_husband_its_going_to_be_years/", "score": 224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
