But things got weird when I met her mom\u2026\n\nWe went over to hers for dinner, and she and her mom only talked about how close he was to them. They told me that when he\u2019d gone over to 25F\u2019s house, he\u2019d stripped down to his undies so she could do his laundry, and that she did his hair. (He\u2019d never mentioned this.) They have a special nickname for him and tease me for not using it. The daughter even went upstairs to change into the same outfit I was wearing. \n\nThe mom was even more possessive. For months now, she\u2019s iced me out over and over\u2026I didn\u2019t hear from him for 2 days and later found out she\u2019d taken him on a trip to NY. When he moved back, the mom flew in to help and asked him to stay in her hotel room for the night.

When I take a bite of his food, she immediately asks him to \u201cmake her a bite.\u201d This summer, they insisted that they all take a vacation together- I wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nA few days ago his mother passed. He decided to stay in his condo alone for the night. 50sF flew in at 1 AM and went straight to his condo. There\u2019s no couch and it\u2019s a 1 bedroom. She slept in his bed for two days. \n\nI was shocked but I didn\u2019t say anything, this is NOT the time- he can barely talk and is processing his grief. But I was so appalled and insulted. She also told me not to come over to check on him. She even asked me to drive her around and run errands for her. I ignored that and went over. \n\nEvery time I tried to get close to him, cuddle in his bed, sit next to him, she took my place or made him move. Then she got ice cream on her shirt, and she took it off in the living room(!) As I was laying next to him, she hovered over us.\n\nHis uncle and grandparents seem to have an issue with her too.

If he likes being treated like this there\u2019s nothing to solve \ud83e\udd37", "Yeah, he\u2019s been around them for like ten years and I think he\u2019s so used to them being so buddy buddy that it\u2019ll be hard to see that this isn\u2019t the standard. But I definitely need to drive home that this isn\u2019t normal and this either needs an adjustment or I\u2019m walking away, I feel so insecure and weird after every time I see them I can\u2019t do it anymore.", "Umm, this women is a predator. She is taking advantage of your boyfriends grief, and her role win his life.", "Dude she\u2019s no surrogate mom. Sharing his bed, flirting, eating from his plate, removing clothing in front of him\u2026she wants to be a MILF.", "You miss the point.\n\nShe's made it quite clear that she's not willing to play second fiddle to this older woman and/or her daughter.\n\nHe puts a stop to this, or she's out. Period.\n\nYes, of course BF needs therapy. You know that, I know that, OP knows that ... *and BF doesn't.* BF needs a wake-up call. How do you propose to make that happen, if not by OP telling him \"if this continues, I'm outta here\"?", "It's very obvious that the BF is viewing this woman as a second mother, OP even mentioned that in the post. It's also very clear that this older woman is taking advantage of the BF's vulnerability to either start a sexual relationship with him or she plans on just driving OP away so he can date her daughter. Either way to me it seems like the BF is not processing his mom's death properly and that's why he is enjoying the attention he's getting from this other woman that he, himself describes as a mother.", "No, you're missing the point the dude has an unhealthy attachment to this woman, and you're saying an ultimatum is going to make him magically stop? No, it's gonna push him away. So like I said 4 times already if she wants to lose her BF then sure go for the ultimatum.", "> It's very obvious that the BF is viewing this woman as a second mother\n\nRiiiiiiiight. She takes off her shirt in front of him, she sleeps in the same bed with him. \"Second mother\". Suuuuuurrrrrre. Totally normal maternal behavior.", "Yeah until he ends up in bed with her with no clothes on", "I\u2019ve seen ultimatums work many times.  It probably won\u2019t in this case, but if OP is willing and ready to walk away from this relationship, i would issue it.  Especially if i were in her shoes.  This is a really fucked up situation i wouldn\u2019t put up with another minute.", "You have it backwards: *she* has an unhealthy attachment to *him*.", "Wouldn't be surprised if that does end up happening. The older woman is definitely testing the waters and seeing how much she can get away with."]}
