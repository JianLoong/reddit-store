Three months in, his mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He had to move home several states away. I moved out (at his request) for 3 months (got my own place). His mom and I got along amazingly, she even left family jewelry to me in her will. \n\nHe\u2019d told me about his friend (25F) who\u2019d had a crush on him in high school- fine. He also told me that he\u2019d stayed at her apartment for a night when he\u2019d gotten there- also fine. But things got weird when I met her mom\u2026\n\nWe went over to hers for dinner, and she and her mom only talked about how close he was to them. They told me that when he\u2019d gone over to 25F\u2019s house, he\u2019d stripped down to his undies so she could do his laundry, and that she did his hair. (He\u2019d never mentioned this.) They have a special nickname for him and tease me for not using it. The daughter even went upstairs to change into the same outfit I was wearing. \n\nThe mom was even more possessive. For months now, she\u2019s iced me out over and over\u2026I didn\u2019t hear from him for 2 days and later found out she\u2019d taken him on a trip to NY. When he moved back, the mom flew in to help and asked him to stay in her hotel room for the night. (He could have stayed at mine.) \n\nI asked \u201cone bed or two?\u201d He said my suggestion was gross, she\u2019s like a mom to him. \n\nShe keeps crossing boundaries- she takes sips of his drink at dinner. When I take a bite of his food, she immediately asks him to \u201cmake her a bite.\u201d This summer, they insisted that they all take a vacation together- I wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nA few days ago his mother passed. He decided to stay in his condo alone for the night. 50sF flew in at 1 AM and went straight to his condo. There\u2019s no couch and it\u2019s a 1 bedroom. She slept in his bed for two days. \n\nI was shocked but I didn\u2019t say anything, this is NOT the time- he can barely talk and is processing his grief. But I was so appalled and insulted. She also told me not to come over to check on him. She even asked me to drive her around and run errands for her. I ignored that and went over. \n\nEvery time I tried to get close to him, cuddle in his bed, sit next to him, she took my place or made him move. Then she got ice cream on her shirt, and she took it off in the living room(!) As I was laying next to him, she hovered over us.\n\nHis uncle and grandparents seem to have an issue with her too. He told me that she and his family were \u201cfighting over him.\u201d \n\nHe never stops her from crossing the line.

I have zero jealousy about any of his exes. Only one ex makes me feel murderous and that's the one who abused him. It's a fight on sight for me as far as she's concerned. \n\nOn that note, I WOULD BE SO EXTREMELY UNCOMFY AND NOT OKAY WITH ANYTHING YOU DESCRIBED IN YOUR POST. That woman is preying on your bf during an extremely vulnerable time in his life. It sounds like this behavior is not new for her towards him. He's not drawing strong boundaries towards her which I assume is a combination of past grooming by her (aka she normalized this intrusive and inappropriate behavior with him early), the loss of a mother which might make him find a maternal figure comforting, and the paralyzing trauma of losing a parent.\n\nSo, you've likely heard of the flight/fight response but there's more to it than that. It's actually fight/flight/fawn/freeze. It sounds like he's freezing/fawning in situations where normally someone would fight or flee. If he wasn't currently traumatized by loss/grieving a parent I would tell you to dump his ass and move on. However, his internal compass right now is likely spinning in circles. If he is important to you and you see a future with him then you need to be his compass right now. If you don't see a future with him then you need to cut your losses and move on. Because helping him is going to be a lot. \n\nYou need to sit him down and have an extremely frank talk about how he feels about her attention and behavior. If it makes him uncomfortable and he just goes along with it because it's easier then you need to basically BE his boundaries for him until he is in a place where he can firmly hold his own boundaries. Stick to him like glue. Don't let her push you out or away. If he wants your help with boundaries then be empowered by that and push back.\n\nThis is a sort of unique situation where he is in an extremely vulnerable place and might not be able to stand up for himself at the moment. All my advice above is in the context of a child mourning a parent (I lost my father way too young so I'm speaking from experience).

Because that's the city where Oedipus was king and fucked his mom.", "Tricky because he\u2019s not close with them, he was only close with his mom (no dad in the picture), so he\u2019s so alone now family-wise and he has this family and that\u2019s most of his support system now, I don\u2019t wanna screw around with his support when he just needs to grieve but she\u2019s really swooping in while he\u2019s broken down and taking control so it\u2019s alarming for sure. \n\nI think if I go to his family he\u2019d be PISSED and not receptive at all sadly. But I would absolutely love to hear their honest opinion of all this for sure.", "I get that, trying to see it as a \" throwing themselves at him\" situation .....no. THIS IS SO ENMESHED AND INAPPROPRIATE..FOR ANYONE TO DO LET ALONE HIS EX GIRLFRIENDS MOTHER!! this isn't a hind sight is 20/20 , this is a full on YOU SEE THE CAUTION CONES AND RED LIGHTS saying STOP ! FALLING BOULDERS! STEEP DROP\n\nEdit. He needs therapy she can't provide, and is so groomed into this it's hard to believe it hasn't been since childhood.", "This is very helpful and I really appreciate you taking the time to write it all out! \n\nI haven\u2019t felt (until now) confident enough to say I need to step in actively here, but I agree (and would LOVE to say \u201cleave him be\u201d to her). I need him to be fully onboard with me standing up and saying back up to her but if he defends it and wants her to continue to be three feet up his you know what, I don\u2019t have anything worth fighting for here. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you lost your father, I can\u2019t imagine, and I cried this week just thinking about losing a parent. He doesn\u2019t have a father to look to for support, security, or advice so he\u2019s totally lost and I know it\u2019s going to be comfortable for him to fall back on them for support and I\u2019m seeing it unfold. But I agree now is the time to actually support him by protecting him from this BS if he\u2019ll allow it, and if he won\u2019t\u2026well we have our answer", "Thank you, this is really good advice and I appreciate you!", "Just refuse next time she tries to get between the two of you.\n\n\n\n\"No thanks! I'm quite comfortable with Boyfriend, you're so sweet :)\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, hahaha! That's ok! I'd love to sit next to him, I've missed him all day :)\"\n\n\n\n\"Why don't you take a seat on [seat way tf over there] you've been on your feet all day, you deserve a rest! Go ahead, I'd feel bad if you didn't :)\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh try a bite of MY food too!!!! It's *delicious!!!*\" *(shoves a bite of your food in her mouth too, making her just as uncomfortable as you are, so she cuts that shit out).*\n\n\n\n\"Oh I'd love a hug too! You've been SO sweet!!!! Can we call you Auntie X???\" *(taking any sexiness away from her title)*\n\n\n\nSocially Engineer the situation so that he is not taken advantage of. He is in a vulnerable position in his grief right now, and he needs you to run interference, not ditch him. Be on his team. He's too grief stricken to even recognize what she's doing, or process what's going on.", "Wow all of this is soooo valid.\n\nBut right now he *just* lost his mom. So it's about damage control with the immediate situation.\n\nTalk to him and say, I want to be here for you exactly how you need right now. Please be straightforward with me and I will do my best to be there in that way. And, I've noticed that Fanny is really in your space, how can I be most helpful with her? Do you want me to take her out for a bit so you can get some time, or do you want to stay at my place so you can get some rest?\n\nThen just listen and try to do what he needs. He may need somebody right now to run interference for him. He probably can't do his own boundaries right now.\n\nAlso. I think when someone takes their shirt off in the living room, you can say something in the moment. Like, hey Franny, do you need me to spot treat that shirt so you can put it back on our can I get you a towel to cover up? Or, whoa!", "This lady makes me think of those teachers that sexually abuse young men \u2026.NTA OP if you take a stand.", "Maybe suggest he sees a therapist or.a grief counsellor to help deal with his mother's passing. He may be desperate for that bond to stay but doesn't realise what he sacrificing or how unhealthy it is.", "Please update us when you can! You've gotten a lot of good advice. Good luck!", "That's why you need to have the very frank conversation with him about how he feels about the behavior. Even if it makes him uncomfortable. Let him know you aren't trying to be cruel or make him upset but you need to know how he feels so you can help support him. If he adamantly defends her and her behavior then yeah it's likely a lost cause. \n\nIt's okay. \u2764\ufe0f It's been over two decades since I lost him. The pain is a distant memory but one that will never fully leave me. That's why I replied. I normally am more of a lurker who occasionally comments. Your post resonated with me and i wanted to reach out with my thoughts. I am hoping he wants help from you but I'm also glad that you seem to have a realistic perspective on the situation if it turns out he actually welcomes her behavior.", "Yeah even if it's not sexual (pretty sure it is, hell the friend may have even developed the crush *because* of the mom) it's definitely not normal and crossing a line.", "My mother always said \u201ckill \u2018em with kindness\u201d but honestly I kinda just wanna kill \u2018em regular instead\n\n(for legal reasons THIS IS A JOKE, I am tired and wigged out, forgive me)", "I would say can we call you Grandma instead of Auntie ,lol!", "Right, I really want him to focus on healing and pulling himself back together right now. \n\nI did ask him day two after she passed if he wanted to stay with me and he decided to stay in the condo, yes it came hand in hand with being able to be on his computer for a while and zone out but it also meant sharing a bed with her and that was the night I sobbed to think he would CHOOSE that. But a couple days later he chose to stay with me when I offered and I think he was mentally clearer then. \n\nI wish I\u2019d reacted to her being in a bra but I didn\u2019t want to give her the satisfaction of my reaction, Y\u2019know? She\u2019d been really quiet with me the whole night and it felt like one final dig at me.", "You can bet your bottom dollar I\u2019ll update, this has been amazing advice!", "Now is not the time, while you are *actually burying his mother,* and emotions are high.\n\n\n\nDo not become the drama.\n\n\n\nBe the calm, focused, grounded one who he can lean on and offer your support, while protecting him from her.", "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this.  She is acting so very weird.  Is she after his inheritance? Or does she really want him as a bf??!   He hasn\u2019t said anything about how she is acting?   Just push her to the side.  She has no more right to him than anyone else.  Do what you can to keep her out but be prepared, he may choose her in the end.  I hope not tho. Hopefully he will come out of his grief soon and put a stop to this.  If it goes on too long (I think it already has) or if it gets worse, you\u2019ll have to say something to him.  This is not normal.  At all.  My family was \u201ccuddly\u201d but this is ridiculous.", "When she does stuff, Pat her hand and say stuff like \u201cbless your heart \u201c.  And \u201cyes dear\u201d.  Like deal it with a dotty old lady.", "I would just start calling her grandma.  Or nan.  Lol.", "Couldn't he have taken his computer and zoned out at your place????", "When she does something odd, can you say \u201cmrs, are you feeling ok?\u201d Or even \u201care you not taking something that the doc thinks you should?\u201d  Just some way to signal \u201cthis is off\u201d without being to blatant about it? (Hopefully you can e pretty blunt soon.  Ugh)", "bro you ever try moving a 40 pound desktop and two mounted monitors? that shit aint going anywhere"]}
