So most would hate it with siblings they are always around, but then to be forced in with someone you see around 4ish days a month? Even worse. The thing with being in a dorm is you knew you would be and had some agency over the situation. This girl doesn't and it sounds like she previously had more privacy.

It hurts everyone. I've listened to people of all genders describe childhood sexual abuse, not just women - it's almost always the older sibling doing the abuse. I'm a feminist, but I think you are taking this too far, accusing a NINE YEAR OLD of being a future sexual assaulter, just for the crime of being male? \n\nThe court could determine that connection with mom and siblings is more important than her wants. Other kids with custody only 2 weekends a month don't even share a room or kick the boy out of his room to punish him for having a penis, they sleep on the couch and change in the bathroom, and it honestly sucks more than having a bed and divider in a room that you share with a young boy.

It might be smaller but if a bed with under bed storage could fit and the main rooms have play space it\u2019s certainly a solution for a few years.\n\nADUs are, depending on how handy you are, a relatively affordable \u201caddition\u201d that can be built out for a few thousand dollars into a space like a micro studio - the eldest could use one of these. One of the cheapest ways is to buy a shed and run electricity through before decorating.\n\nIs there a basement or attic that could be cheaply finished to provide an extra space?\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that people with 4 kids make it work all of the time but it\u2019s going to be inherently awkward for a child in her teens to share with ANY 9 year old, regardless of gender. It\u2019s a 5 year age difference and their lives are going to have very different trajectories right now. 14 is a key time to develop personal boundaries and having no privacy from even your favorite little sibling is tough.\n\nAnd, frankly, unless your ex chose a run down fire hazard, odds are they could have looked into a less ideal four bed rather than the three bed but prioritized finishes over total space.", "NTA Now the two youngest girls sharing a room NO problem since they are both girls now a teenage girl going though puberty or about to and a NINE year old BOY sharing a room wow yeah BIG problem, I feel for the mom because I don't wish financial problems on anybody but expecting your teenage daughter to share a room with her half brother is weird, creepy, and Iam pretty sure against CPS guidelines and just frowned upon everywhere else.......except Alabama and Florida lol jkjkjkjk.", "NTA, it is absolutely inappropriate for a teenage girl to share a room with a boy. Teens need privacy. Maybe, *maybe* she might be willing to share with her younger sister, but the brother is an absolute no. Good for you for watching out for your daughter!", "NTA. A 14 year old girl should not be sharing a room with a 9 year old boy. She needs privacy and space, and if she was being forced to share a room it should be with her half sisters, not the half brother - that\u2019s just weird.", "NTA. \n\nThe daughter is within her right to refuse this situation.

It\u2019s not like the brother is 17 or something.

Hate to say take all the time away but if you don't have the resources (enough bedrooms) to house the minion the minimal time you're allotted, then you can't care for her appropriately. \n\nYou can plan all kinds of events and activities so they still interact. Honestly, that may improve the relationship anyways because it sounds like mom's blending is coming at a price to her relationship with her eldest.

He used her room when she wasn\u2019t with me. I apologized profusely that we couldn\u2019t give him his own room at that point. He totally understood. He told me he really appreciated that I included him in the decision rather than just making it and expecting him to do whatever we decided. He didn\u2019t come over on a set schedule, just when his schedule was free. He was a very busy teen. We didn\u2019t meet him until he was 16. When we moved into a bigger house, he got his own room. He had a ton of fun picking out his bedding and color he wanted the room to be. \n\nMy whole point is, your daughter and your ex need to talk and work out something that works for both of them.

Make her three children share one room just so the child that is barely there gets her own room? Sometimes life just happens and the father should\u2019ve been an adult and talked to his daughter about it because obviously the mother wouldn\u2019t have moved into a three-bedroom if she didn\u2019t have a choice. I hope the father never has financial difficulties like that, and ends up in a one bedroom apartment, and has to go through the same thing.\n\nIt\u2019s also ridiculous how much people make a big deal about boy and girl siblings sharing a room.

I believe no one said they should actually call social services.", "Why not?", "It isn't necessarily inappropriate if everyone in the family is fine with it, but the daughter said pretty clearly that she is not fine with it. I think that's extremely understandable. A 14-year-old teenager should not have to give up her privacy or comfort to share with a boy if she doesn't want to. Yes, he's her half-brother, but that doesn't mean she's comfortable sharing an intimate space with him (changing clothes, sleeping, pajamas, etc.). Even it's just a feeling and not an actual specific physical concern that he would do anything wrong, she deserves to feel comfortable in her own bedroom. It's awkward at best; at worst, yes, sadly, some siblings *do* go through with inappropriate things. It can't be ruled out.", "I do agree with that, the parents do need to co-parent", "I think you guys are confusing the benefit allowance offer with any minimum required by law.", "I mean she\u2019s over there 4 days per month. that\u2019s probably 2 nights per month. at that point it\u2019s probably more her brother\u2019s room than hers, and maybe she feels more pushed out/alienated by her mom\u2019s family by no longer having her own dedicated space rather than jumping to assumptions about sexual impropriety. I honestly feel bad for this prepubescent boy with how many of the commenters are making assumptions, when OP included absolutely no details about why she doesn\u2019t want to share a room. \n\nhonestly given she sleeps there so infrequently and depending on how close dad & mom live, it\u2019s probably the best solution if she just lives full time at dad\u2019s given the space constraints and maybe goes over to mom\u2019s during the day. but that depends on the custody agreement. \n\nmy main problem is that so many people assume this girl is getting sexually harassed by her 9 year old brother just on the basis of him having a penis. presumably there is a thinking, feeling child attached.\n\nIf the \u201csharing with a boy\u201d thing were the main problem, she could just share with her two youngest sisters\u2026. I think she mostly just doesn\u2019t want to share a room at all, and she\u2019s already got her own bedroom at her dad\u2019s place", "BS. What about families who can't afford a 3 bedroom house??
