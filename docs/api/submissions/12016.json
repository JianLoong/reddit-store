There's only 2 comments from op, I'm sure it's not difficult to find that one.", "No, she shouldn't demand, but when it's about an issue on the child's sleeping arrangements, I think it's right that both parents are aware and work together. \nBut his only solution was going to pick his daughter up. \nHe also said she should sleep by herself and let the other 3 siblings sleep together in one of his comments, which makes him an ah.", "thanks for your perspective!\n\ni bounced from my mother\u2019s house to my father\u2019s house for a similar reason (although my room was always left empty if i ever decided to change my mind).\n\nOP presented the issue as \u201cam I wrong for supporting my daughter?\u201d but that\u2019s not really what\u2019s happening. supporting his daughter would be pushing back for what he feels is right within the existing relationship. he\u2019s entirely within his rights to say \u201cit\u2019s not okay to make 14F sleep with 9M\u201d but that\u2019s **not what happened.** what happened is he seized on an opportunity to be TA to his ex.\n\nI\u2019m fine with an ESH because calling your ex to settle an argument with your kid a thing, but I think OP deliberately misrepresented the situation to make himself look better (apparently successfully from this comment section).", "Everyone is biased.", "> I said that I think my daughter is right and asked if I should pick her up since it **seems like she is not willing to give her a bedroom for herself.** She called me an asshole and ended the call\n\n(emphasis mine)", "With the 14 and 9 yr old yes. Theyre not full siblings theyre half siblings. Depends on your state but when i was a kid cps removed my sister from the home since there wasnt enough separate bedrooms for us. 1 adult (18) male 1 teenage male (13) and a 5 year old female.", "Because he made the deliberate choice to shack up with a woman who already had kids. He didn't just trip and fall into a relationship with a single mother.", "Right ops worry is his daughter... If she was being treated unfair to the other kids he could demand different but she isn't they all have to share a room because the moma financhel situation ... The mom struggling doesn't make her a bad mom. OP demanding that his daughter get her own room which will sit empty  most of the month well three other kids share a room is not only not fair and a ridiculous request it would also cause animosity and fighting making it impossible for his daughter to form strong bonds with her siblings.\nAnd making her time there much harder.\n\nMaybe what is best is for his daughter to not stay there overnight  BUT to get that he will have to talk to his ex and figure it out so to do what is best for his daughter he has to be diplomatic wait u til the situation calms and talk it out....", "Yes. And my point was that she is the noncustodial parent, if it is not within her means to provide a sole room to the daughter that does not even live there, they will not take away any more of her time. No judge would entertain that. It is in the best interest of the child to have a relationship with her mother.", "Apparently my daughter and ex had a huge argument when she found out she was to share a bedroom with her half brother....learn to read and quit trying to come for me just because you can't.", "And there it is.... Stop interjecting your own bias into this. Your ignoring relevant information because you do indeed hold a grudge.", "With this kind of situations is hard to generalize. I just offered my own situation to give an exemple of what she might feel. I didn't had my room at my mom's house, but honestly, i never had this against her. She simply didn't have the money for a big house, so i never took it as a rejection. For us it was more the fact that she expected us to be happy for having halfsiblings and was upset that we had good clothes and cars (my brother is 8yo older than me, so when he was 18 he had a car and my mom was upset that he refused to drive the halfsibs around like he did with me). My brother would've been NC with her sooner, but he held out for me because i didn't want to be alone in her house.", "Definitely pre-teen to adults, I don't think children or infants have the capability", "\"Apparently my daughter and ex had a huge fight when my daughter found out she is supposed to share a bedroom with her half brother\"\nThat is what i'm talking about. I'm still thinking she should be mature enough to survive sharing a room with her sisters for two weekends/month. I know what i'm talking about. I sometimes shared a room with my two younger step sisters. But never with my brother.", "I\u2019m sorry hear about that but In ur situation was u living there full time or an extended period of time plus since in this case it\u2019s 2 days a month", ">making it impossible for his daughter to form strong bonds with her siblings\n\n As someone who has no relationship with my halfsibs because our mother expected us to give up things just because they couldn't have the same things, her not having strong bonds with her halfsibs is not a matter of life or death. Trust me, she will survive even without them. I have a better relationship with my stepsister, who is my sister in every possible way other than biology, than with the halfsiblings. \n\n>The mom struggling doesn't make her a bad mom\n\nIt doesn't. But OP supporting his daughter living with him full time it doesn't make him a bad father either. \n\n>Maybe what is best is for his daughter to not stay there overnight\n\n I agree with this. Altough... i have to say that i believe there are other problems, other than the room situation. If daughter and mother would have a loving relationship, this room situation wouldn't have been so big. I feel like this is the cherry on top.", ">The mom struggling doesn't make her a bad mom.\n\nOP never said Mom was bad.\n\nI do agree that having a room sit empty most of the month isn't a good idea either.\n\nOP did try to talk, she hung up on him. He should try talking to her one more time, but I'd she hangs up or refuses to discuss it rationally, then it's court time. If the daughter is uncomfortable sleeping in the same room as her brother, the the time for diplomacy is done.", "It is not always in the best interest of the child to have a relationship with their mother. The court can absolutely take away the time she has. Or they could give the daughter the autonomy to make that decision for herself. \n\nA sole room is not the only solution or compromise here. Yes, it\u2019s what the daughter WANTS. But wants do not directly pertain to the possible safety of a situation.", "Yes, the child was referred to as both by OP, right? So there was no need for you to try to correct anything because using either phrase works according to the OP. You are not the OP, lol.", "thanks again for providing your perspective. i\u2019ve heard a lot of people say that their parent\u2019s expectations for how they should relate to their \u201cnew family\u201d is an issue, so i can definitely see how that would hurt! and i definitely don\u2019t want anyone to think that i think 14F is at all wrong for her feelings. my only problem is with how OP is interacting with his ex, and obviously there\u2019s a lot of strong feelings on this topic!", "i see what you mean and completely agree w/ sharing with sisters, thanks!", "The situation isnt all that different there still isnt enough rooms for the children. Either the kid shares with the sisters or the mom.", "He didn't try to talk in a calm diplomatic fashion he said  I'll come get her that isn't trying to fix it I just think that two adults should be able to talk rationally come up with the options they think are reasonable and both could agree to the. Talk to the daughter see if any of them work for her or if she has other ideas", "We have no inclination that the mother is abusive in any way. Of course not every mother is fit and courts will take away rights but that has nothing to do with this situation. You\u2019re mostly just talking in circles and making irrelevant points right now. \n\n\nIt is more dangerous for the prepubescent boy to share a room with her than it is for her to share a room with him. If you agree that the daughter wanting a room is not a necessity what are you even arguing or bringing up CPS for.?", "OMG what TF is your problem. You know what OP never refers to the child as? The step brother because he isn't and there is a difference. That is the only correction I made. You stay blessed now.", "Christ it is not that big of a deal. How is this worth the argument", "OP maybe was too quick to say \"she will go live with me 100%\". On the other hand, if his daughter begged to live with him full time, how could he have said no? \n\n Someone else mentioned daughter visiting mom and not spending the night, and i think this would be the best situation. They could keep a relationship and the room situation doesn't ruin their chances to have a good bond."]}
