I have been w/ J (24M) for around 2 years.  We took a break a few months ago, we live together & feelings are still there so it\u2019s been complicated.  A couple months ago, I went through his phone and found out he had been cheating on me previous to the break.  K has been there for me, told me I deserve better, & whatnot.  I know I do, but it\u2019s hard to leave.  \n\nAnyways to the point, A few weeks ago I went through his phone again, & saw that he had been sending money to OnlyFans, which is weird because one of the reasons we broke up was because I had an OF acc and he wanted me to delete it because he \"doesn't like OF girls\" I confronted him about it, & he admitted that he had been subbed to K's account & has j***ed off to her content.  I was enraged, and hurt, & jealous honestly.  K is beautifu, hell I find her attractive too, but it hurts because I never even thought my bf was looking at her like that.  We were all friends, and now after this the dynamic just wouldn\u2019t work anymore.  He blocked her on everything.  \n\nI told her the other day (2 weeks after I found out) & told her that because of this, she wasn\u2019t allowed at our apartment anymore, I wanna make it work w/ him, but ugh I don\u2019t even want him looking at her.  I told her she didn\u2019t do anything wrong & it\u2019s not her fault.  We hung up and I thought everything was ok.  Well she has been distant since & today I asked why & she said that she feels violated that he would even do that & feels like she is being punished over something she has no control of & felt I was choosing him over her when I should just leave him.  I replied saying that she knew having an OF would bring anonymous creeps & that I feel more violated bc why would he do that to me, that ik he\u2019s bad for me but I love him. That I love her but I just don't want him to be around her, we could still hang at hers, & I wasn't trying to punish her.  We went back and forth a bit but now she won't even talk to me.", "created_utc": 1667587040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym6oyq/aita_for_banning_my_bestfriend_from_our_apartment/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
