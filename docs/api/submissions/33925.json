Happened way too often when people spoke another language in front of me(usually about me) at my former retail job, I\u2019d usually continue the conversation in said language and they\u2019d be completely flabbergasted most of the time.\n\nEdit: spelling", "HAHAHA...She thought everyone spoke Maori and not English?? AHAHAAHAHAHA...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only thing you can do is speak to her and explain that you did not set her up that maybe SHE Should have done some research on New Zealand before the trip...you know, things that people normally do before going to a foreign country so they you know, don't make a fool of themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYour friend thought people wouldn\u2019t understand English in\u2026.New Zealand?

Yet, even without that, she knew there were two official languages, one being ENGLISH and she still assumed they wouldn\u2019t understand it, at all. Risky roulette she took and she bet wrong. \n\n What about Australia, what does she think they speak there?", "NTA.  First, it's extremely rude to have conversations in another language in front of people. It's like whispering in front of company - rude and immature. Second, it was such a weird assumption that people in New Zealand wouldn't understand English.  Third, her comment was crude. Fourth, she's embarrassed because of her poor manners and assumption, so she's projecting on you. There's no way you set her up. \n\nYou shouldn't feel guilty.  She's got a lot of growing up to do before she's actually considered an adult. She can start by admitting all of this is her fault and apologizing.", "No offense, but Are you and your friend American? Sorry for the cliche but it sounds a lot like all those \u2018Americans in the wild\u2019 that every other country gets to experience \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA. Ignorance is never an excuse not to inform yourself. She knew she was traveling with you and didn\u2019t try to get basic facts about the country. And as they were friends to your mom, probability that they could speak English was high, even more so for the boy your age as I think nowadays everyone learns English at school. She just learnt a precious lesson!", "This could've been Indonesia and you're friend still would've been making an ass of herself. \n\nIn the incredibly unlikely chance this is real, NTA", "NTA and your friend is hella stupid.

Your friend is 17, not 7\u2026.", "NTA your friend is stupid, you told her there\u2019s two official languages including English and she saw people and for some reason assumed they didn\u2019t speak English. I want to assume the son was not white, which makes your friend even more of an AH. \nInfo: what complexion were your mums friend and her son?", "NTA\n\nYour friend is an idiot of immeasurable proportions.
