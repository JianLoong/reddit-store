She never said she meant only potty trained kids. This really comes down to a lack of communication on everybody\u2019s end. OP could have handled the situation by trying to find a compromise instead of getting angry.

You didn't need to argue and escalate the situation.", "YTA. \n\nIt **IS** unhygienic.

I can\u2019t believe you think you\u2019re right here. Even the way you\u2019re describing pushing your point long past when you should have realized and dropped it makes you the asshole.", "YTA, your sister's rule was not unreasonable and although I can see why you were disappointed and didn't necessarily anticipate it, you're the one blowing it out of proportion at this point. Your argument about pee in public pools is also a weak one - just because it happens doesn't mean it's allowed, some pools even use a tracer that will change color and highlight someone doing it so they can be kicked out, and a private pool likely doesn't have the same level of chemical control. This probably made everyone less sympathetic to you.\n\nIt wasn't a slight against your son. It was a fair rule that will no longer exclude him when he completes potty training. Tell him it's one of the things you get to do when you're a \"big boy\" who doesn't need diapers anymore. There are lots of things kids can't do until they're a certain age, size, or skill level, and you're teaching entitlement instead of grace here.", "YTA most people buy personal pools for this exact reason.  I wouldn\u2019t want a toddler in a swim diaper in my pool. \n\nYour kids are not entitled to use her pool. And to argue or guilt her isn\u2019t right. She pulled you aside instead of having a conversation in front of everyone. But you decided you where right and your parents and other siblings would side with you and guilt her so you ran and rattled to them on her. You didn\u2019t get the reaction you wanted so now your mad.", "Sorry friend but YTA here, the clue is in your assumption that your own standards would be fine for everyone. Yeah it sucks that your youngest wasn't allowed to swim (I think the idea others have had about setting up a paddling pool in future visits).  Ultimately it's your sister's pool and her rules. Suck it up. Apologise and don't make this into a bigger deal than it needs to be!", "YTA, her pool, her rules.

No question about it.", "YTA - it\u2019s your sister\u2019s pool, not a public pool, you don\u2019t get to dictate what she allows and doesn\u2019t allow. Also, peeing in the pool IS disgusting and is not normal, so you\u2019re also the asshole for using that as an excuse.

All my relatives that have pools have a similar rule, no kids who aren't toilet trained go in for a swim.", "Peeing in pools is gross, and I sincerely hope you truly don't believe 'everyone' does it.

I get the why you\u2019re upset because you\u2019re defending your child and right now you and your sister are both in your emotions. \n\nThis should have been a conversation beforehand but she is right to want a pee and poop pool. Public pools pump a ton of chlorine in to make up for all the ick but your regular house pool does not have as many chemicals. \n\nLet this one go and talk beforehand about things.", "YTA. Babies/toddlers still in diapers create unsanitary conditions in pools.  Fecal matter can be leaked into the water and put other swimmers at risk for infection.  \nPublic pools do not allow children in diapers to swim. \nGet your own pool and let your child swim in it.  You can't tell someone what to do with their own property.", "YTA it isn\u2019t your pool. She gets to make the rules for it. Yes, dealing with a disappointed and upset 3 year old sucks, but sometimes that it what you have to deal with as a parent. You were rude and dramatic and owe her an apology.", "YTA.  And it was pretty clear from your first paragraph.  It's not that reddit \"isn't the most understanding towards parents of young kids\" It's that parents like you aren't the most understanding that their kids aren't the center of everyone else's universe.  Your child is not the center of the universe.  You need to grow up and stop acting like a teenager.  \n\n\nI feel bad for you seven year old, who likely won't be getting many pool invites thanks to mom.", "YTA. Do you have any clue what someone \"just peeing in a pool\" does to the upkeep. If you are willing to shell out for the chemicals and such, then you have a leg to stand on. I am doing my best to be civil here, especially given the nutjobs that I grew up around in mine and my wife's family. Ok. As a parent, stop thinking that the world revolves around your kids. Yes, your 3 year old threw a tantrum about not swimming because he saw Mommy doing the same thing.", "Yta. She probably could've cleared it beforehand, but my eldest sister has a pool and whenever there's barbecues the toddlers never get in it for the same reason. Either way, its not your house. Just get over it. Your toddler probably forgot about it at this point.", "YTA - the comment about \u201cReddit not being understanding towards parents of young kids\u201d did it for me but the post solidified it. \n\nYou\u2019re the type of parent who expects the world to bend around your child and throws a fit when they don\u2019t. Sounds like you already know that though because you warned everyone in the top line of your post.", "YTA, I am a mum with 2 now teenage kids, telling younger kids they are too young for something is pretty bog standard parenting, and only becomes a big issue if you have never said no to them before or you make it one.\n\nPrivate pools often have a much lighter touch filtration and cleansing system than public pools because of user numbers and people hopefully treating their own pool with more respect than a public pool.\n\nWere you intending to be in the pool with the toddler? \n\n>so I only assumed my kids would get to be included\n\nAnd why on earth you assumed this I have no idea, I would have assumed it was for everyone at the party,", "YTA. It\u2019s her pool. If she doesn\u2019t want a kid that\u2019s not potty trained in the pool, that\u2019s her right.

Even young kids (once toilet trained) should have the expectation that they get out of the pool when they need to pee.  \n\nIt's entirely possible she expected that your 3-year old was toilet trained and/or that you would realize that if he wasn't he shouldn't be in the pool.", "I have a toddler. But I live in a country where you wear a swim diaper and then a neoprene bathing suit over. This morning my very much not potty trained toddler managed to do his morning poo while we were in the pool. Not one tiny bit of gunk came out. I suggest you invest in these very cheap pieces of apparel- and apologise to your sister. She has to clean the pool (unlike a public pool) and nobody wants to swim in wee.  Plus probably chemical levels can be kept lower in a private pool if nobody pees in there. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t want to swim in a pool with my toddler if it wasn\u2019t for the neoprene pants.

She should've told you before. Personal pools and swim diapers can be nasty.  \n\nYour reaction was childish. Her desire to keep your kid out of the pool at a pool party is pretty low.

People don\u2019t like swimming in your child\u2019s urine.", "YTA why do you think there are special baby nappies for swimming. I used to be a lifeguard and the amount of chemicals we had to add in especially during the holiday when kids were around was horrendous. Plus house pools are not given chemicals as often so people are literally swimming in piss.", "YTA no one else wants to bathe in your babys piss. Entitled parent alert.", "I\u2019m a mum with young kids - I think this is ESH. \n\nYou absolutely are right to be upset that your kid was excluded, especially as you weren\u2019t warned before you\u2019d gotten there. The least your sister could\u2019ve done is tell you, possibly even provide a little paddling pool. Without warning you, you couldn\u2019t warn your child and then the whole situation unfolded. I\u2019d be annoyed if I had been invited to a house with a pool expecting the whole family to swim because I\u2019d been given no indication otherwise only to be told that my youngest was being excluded. \n\nAlso potty training suggests that you are at least part of the way- I assume your little one is at least communicating when they need to go? If so, then your sister should\u2019ve asked how much they could control themselves before banning them from the pool. \n\nThat being said, it still is your sister\u2019s pool. She has the right to say no to people swimming in it. People pee in pools all the time for sure, whether they admit it or not, but it\u2019s still not something that pool owners want to happen. She has every right to make decisions about who goes in her pool. \n\nSo yeah- ESH. Her for not warning you and you for not accepting it. And that\u2019s from a young mum too so I understand where you are coming from entirely. My potty trained toddler still has accidents and I\u2019d be so upset if I was abruptly told he couldn\u2019t do something just because he wasn\u2019t 100% dry.", "YTA Your sister\u2019s pool is her own, not a public one.
