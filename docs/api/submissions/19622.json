She never said she meant only potty trained kids. This really comes down to a lack of communication on everybody\u2019s end. OP could have handled the situation by trying to find a compromise instead of getting angry.

You didn't need to argue and escalate the situation.", "YTA. \n\nIt **IS** unhygienic.

I can\u2019t believe you think you\u2019re right here. Even the way you\u2019re describing pushing your point long past when you should have realized and dropped it makes you the asshole.", "YTA, your sister's rule was not unreasonable and although I can see why you were disappointed and didn't necessarily anticipate it, you're the one blowing it out of proportion at this point. Your argument about pee in public pools is also a weak one - just because it happens doesn't mean it's allowed, some pools even use a tracer that will change color and highlight someone doing it so they can be kicked out, and a private pool likely doesn't have the same level of chemical control. This probably made everyone less sympathetic to you.\n\nIt wasn't a slight against your son. It was a fair rule that will no longer exclude him when he completes potty training. Tell him it's one of the things you get to do when you're a \"big boy\" who doesn't need diapers anymore. There are lots of things kids can't do until they're a certain age, size, or skill level, and you're teaching entitlement instead of grace here.", "YTA most people buy personal pools for this exact reason.  I wouldn\u2019t want a toddler in a swim diaper in my pool. \n\nYour kids are not entitled to use her pool. And to argue or guilt her isn\u2019t right. She pulled you aside instead of having a conversation in front of everyone. But you decided you where right and your parents and other siblings would side with you and guilt her so you ran and rattled to them on her. You didn\u2019t get the reaction you wanted so now your mad.", "Sorry friend but YTA here, the clue is in your assumption that your own standards would be fine for everyone. Yeah it sucks that your youngest wasn't allowed to swim (I think the idea others have had about setting up a paddling pool in future visits).  Ultimately it's your sister's pool and her rules. Suck it up. Apologise and don't make this into a bigger deal than it needs to be!", "YTA, her pool, her rules.

No question about it.", "YTA - it\u2019s your sister\u2019s pool, not a public pool, you don\u2019t get to dictate what she allows and doesn\u2019t allow. Also, peeing in the pool IS disgusting and is not normal, so you\u2019re also the asshole for using that as an excuse.

All my relatives that have pools have a similar rule, no kids who aren't toilet trained go in for a swim.", "Peeing in pools is gross, and I sincerely hope you truly don't believe 'everyone' does it.

I get the why you\u2019re upset because you\u2019re defending your child and right now you and your sister are both in your emotions. \n\nThis should have been a conversation beforehand but she is right to want a pee and poop pool. Public pools pump a ton of chlorine in to make up for all the ick but your regular house pool does not have as many chemicals. \n\nLet this one go and talk beforehand about things.", "YTA. Babies/toddlers still in diapers create unsanitary conditions in pools.  Fecal matter can be leaked into the water and put other swimmers at risk for infection.  \nPublic pools do not allow children in diapers to swim. \nGet your own pool and let your child swim in it.  You can't tell someone what to do with their own property.", "YTA it isn\u2019t your pool. She gets to make the rules for it. Yes, dealing with a disappointed and upset 3 year old sucks, but sometimes that it what you have to deal with as a parent. You were rude and dramatic and owe her an apology.", "YTA.  And it was pretty clear from your first paragraph.  It's not that reddit \"isn't the most understanding towards parents of young kids\" It's that parents like you aren't the most understanding that their kids aren't the center of everyone else's universe.  Your child is not the center of the universe.

Do you have any clue what someone \"just peeing in a pool\" does to the upkeep. If you are willing to shell out for the chemicals and such, then you have a leg to stand on. I am doing my best to be civil here, especially given the nutjobs that I grew up around in mine and my wife's family. Ok. As a parent, stop thinking that the world revolves around your kids. Yes, your 3 year old threw a tantrum about not swimming because he saw Mommy doing the same thing.", "Yta. She probably could've cleared it beforehand, but my eldest sister has a pool and whenever there's barbecues the toddlers never get in it for the same reason. Either way, its not your house. Just get over it. Your toddler probably forgot about it at this point.", "YTA - the comment about \u201cReddit not being understanding towards parents of young kids\u201d did it for me but the post solidified it. \n\nYou\u2019re the type of parent who expects the world to bend around your child and throws a fit when they don\u2019t. Sounds like you already know that though because you warned everyone in the top line of your post.", "YTA, I am a mum with 2 now teenage kids, telling younger kids they are too young for something is pretty bog standard parenting, and only becomes a big issue if you have never said no to them before or you make it one.\n\nPrivate pools often have a much lighter touch filtration and cleansing system than public pools because of user numbers and people hopefully treating their own pool with more respect than a public pool.\n\nWere you intending to be in the pool with the toddler? \n\n>so I only assumed my kids would get to be included\n\nAnd why on earth you assumed this I have no idea, I would have assumed it was for everyone at the party,", "YTA. It\u2019s her pool. If she doesn\u2019t want a kid that\u2019s not potty trained in the pool, that\u2019s her right.

Even young kids (once toilet trained) should have the expectation that they get out of the pool when they need to pee.  \n\nIt's entirely possible she expected that your 3-year old was toilet trained and/or that you would realize that if he wasn't he shouldn't be in the pool.", "I have a toddler. But I live in a country where you wear a swim diaper and then a neoprene bathing suit over. This morning my very much not potty trained toddler managed to do his morning poo while we were in the pool. Not one tiny bit of gunk came out. I suggest you invest in these very cheap pieces of apparel- and apologise to your sister. She has to clean the pool (unlike a public pool) and nobody wants to swim in wee.  Plus probably chemical levels can be kept lower in a private pool if nobody pees in there. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t want to swim in a pool with my toddler if it wasn\u2019t for the neoprene pants.

She should've told you before. Personal pools and swim diapers can be nasty.  \n\nYour reaction was childish. Her desire to keep your kid out of the pool at a pool party is pretty low.

People don\u2019t like swimming in your child\u2019s urine.", "YTA why do you think there are special baby nappies for swimming. I used to be a lifeguard and the amount of chemicals we had to add in especially during the holiday when kids were around was horrendous. Plus house pools are not given chemicals as often so people are literally swimming in piss.", "YTA no one else wants to bathe in your babys piss. Entitled parent alert.", "I\u2019m a mum with young kids - I think this is ESH. \n\nYou absolutely are right to be upset that your kid was excluded, especially as you weren\u2019t warned before you\u2019d gotten there. The least your sister could\u2019ve done is tell you, possibly even provide a little paddling pool. Without warning you, you couldn\u2019t warn your child and then the whole situation unfolded. I\u2019d be annoyed if I had been invited to a house with a pool expecting the whole family to swim because I\u2019d been given no indication otherwise only to be told that my youngest was being excluded. \n\nAlso potty training suggests that you are at least part of the way- I assume your little one is at least communicating when they need to go? If so, then your sister should\u2019ve asked how much they could control themselves before banning them from the pool. \n\nThat being said, it still is your sister\u2019s pool. She has the right to say no to people swimming in it. People pee in pools all the time for sure, whether they admit it or not, but it\u2019s still not something that pool owners want to happen. She has every right to make decisions about who goes in her pool. \n\nSo yeah- ESH. Her for not warning you and you for not accepting it. And that\u2019s from a young mum too so I understand where you are coming from entirely. My potty trained toddler still has accidents and I\u2019d be so upset if I was abruptly told he couldn\u2019t do something just because he wasn\u2019t 100% dry.", "YTA Your sister\u2019s pool is her own, not a public one.

Presumably the kid can't swim, so would have to be attended closely anyway. During potty training, unless they are just starting, it's mostly just reminding them and helping them with clothes.

But you can't invite that person to a pool party without explaining that in advance.", "Your sister Should have told you before hand, instead of letting you rock up with your kids and have to tell one No.", "NTA, 100% because she should have told you before you got there. The event doesn't matter, since she allowed a kid to get excited about it, and only *then* made her stipulations clear. The entire event could have been avoided easily if she had merely told you before you arrived. The rest doesn't matter.", "As a pool tech who has maintained residential and commercial pools- you're not even close to being the asshole here. If it was a spa I could see the sister's argument because it could change the chemistry but there's no way a three year old is going to be able to pee so much in a pool that it will change the chemistry or make it unhygienic.   \n\n\nIf it's maintained properly there's enough chlorine (bleach) or another sanitizing agent in there to make it safe for everyone to swim in. Did she make everyone shower before getting in? Because body lotions and sunscreen are going to effect that pool 100x more than a three year old's pee. Tell her if she's so obsessed with her pool being perfectly hygienic she needs to get enzymes and educate herself on how to actually take care of her new pool. There's a difference between a sanitized pool and a clean pool. Does she maintain it and the chemicals or does someone else? \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYour sister is a shitty host and a shitty aunt.

She has no issues with babies in the pool\u2026but more importantly!!!\u2026if she was hosting children that she didn\u2019t want in the pool then she\u2019d get a $20 baby pool and fill it up so that her nephew still got to have fun. \n\nYour sister also could\u2019ve given you a heads up and you could\u2019ve made a call. Your sister sucks.", "NTA - I think I'm in the minority but I have a 2.5 year old and its ridiculous to me to have someone not allow only him of all the kids in her pool. She's being completely unreasonable but yes, it is her choice but imho you have every right to be upset about it. I would feel awful for my 2.5 year old if she had to watch every other kid swim. \n\nShe should have let you know ahead of time if she wasn't going to let your youngest into the pool, then this whole thing could have been avoided. Yes, maybe you overreacted after the fact with your text messages, I wouldn't have said it ruined her relationship with your son, but that's the only part I think you could be considered the asshole. \n\nIf she truly thinks that the 7 year old or other kids aren't going to pee in the pool then oohhhh boy what world is she living in? lol. \n\nIf I were in your shoes I would have packed up my kids and left to go to a public pool or water park because (if you're anything like me) I would have been talking to my kids getting them hyped up for swimming in the pool all morning (because there was NO REASON to assume that your youngest wouldn't have been allowed) and its very important that I keep my word with my kids. Even if it's something out of my control (the toddler wouldn't understand that at all) I will try to make it right if I can. \n\nNow, to everyone saying YTA, if she would have said ahead of time when she mentioned that the kids would get to play in the pool that your youngest wouldn't be allowed to, then yes you would be TA... but she didn't, so NTA.", "NTA. Honestly can't believe everyone here is saying yta, is everyone commenting childless?? I can bet that every other kid in that pool peed while in it. Why would a young kid just stop playing to go pee? It's difficult. \nAlso, why would your sister say the kids could swim in the pool and not mention that the youngest couldn't swim until that moment. She couldn't tell you before you went? That's so incredibly cruel to the child. Kids pick up on this stuff.", "NTA and late to the party: I\u2019m an certified aquatic facility operator and also a mom of a toddler. I have a few opinions. \n\nFirst opinion: swim diapers should always been encased by a cloth diaper cover. No, the paper diaps don\u2019t stop much\u2014 it\u2019s normal in public pools to require a cover. A cover isn\u2019t guaranteed to keep pee in but it absolutely stops tea bag shit effect \n\nSecond opinion: toddler pee volume doesn\u2019t even touch the chem levels. It\u2019s a very small amount off pee per time for toddlers. Unless they\u2019re a champion gallon chugger and there is zero chlorine in the pool pee is a non issue. \n\nThird opinion: I bet money every other kid is dirtier, because they\u2019re bigger. Dirt, skin, oil, shampoo and conditioner are coming in with everyone and making the chlorine work. The bigger kids have more surface area\u2014 a toddler is a very minimal amount of person. A full grown human with no shower will probably affect chems more than a toddler peeing. Btw thats why we ask you to shower before you get in, because you\u2019re gross.\n\nThe way chlorine works (very generally) is that there is \u201cfree chlorine\u201d aka chlorine available to do work and \u201ccombined chlorine\u201d aka chlorine already used up by binding to something gross and sanitizing this. When we talk about pools we generally talk about \u201cbather load\u201d and I think the kids are generally a pretty large bather load and I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be influenced by a toddler. \n\nFourth opinion: parenting is so hard, we depend on other adults, especially those without kids in our community to support us. OP\u2019s sister is prioritizing pool cleanliness over supporting her sibling in a pretty hard time in life. No, she didn\u2019t choose to have kids, but she can choose to have a supportive relationship with her sibling which she is not doing right now. Supportive relationship would\u2019ve been reaching out ahead of time, or realizing you can fix this afterward.\n\nHad very worst happened? 2-3 hours and a bunch of chlorine and the pool is fucking fine. I guarantee OP spent more than that amount of time trying to explain to their toddler why they can\u2019t go in despite being prepared to go in.", "This is Reddit where everyone is super sensitive and thinks we should abide by rules that are cruel just because someone says to. You are NOT the asshole. Plus, I am 99% confident someone peed in the pool knowingly that was potty trained.", "NTA\n\nThe animosity in this thread is quite sad. I couldn't imagine someone doing this to their 3y/o nephew. This isn't entitlement on your part.\n\nI don't think it's an exaggeration to say she has damaged the relationship with her nephew. Not permanently of course. But things like this are a big deal for little people.\n\nDoes she have children of her own?", "NTA.... You: \"So I know from experience that Reddit isn't the most understanding towards parents of young kid.\" Me: gestures broadly. Do not come here with any story about a kid. As for the actual story - every single family, summer party I've thrown, something has been broken or messed up. It is the risk you take when having a bunch of people over. And 4 out of 5 times, it's a kid breaking it. It is completely normal for a swim-diapered kid to go in the pool. There are chemicals for a reason. Your sister is being OCD and bizarre.", "Kids pooping and peeing on pools is no joke. I got cryptosporidium from a public pool. This nasty parasite is transmitted by poo in water. Never, ever swim in a public pool in August. Most do not hyperchlorinate late in the season, to save money. You\u2019re literally swimming in a toilet. \n\nWith that said, you\u2019re NTA. Your sister should have communicated her rules before you arrived. Then you could prepare your child and also understand going in how things will go down. She should have handled this better. I\u2019d be upset too.", "Despite what most people on here think, OP is NTA!\n\nShe wasn't being entitled. Ava invited her, and the rest of their family members, with the claim that the kids can use their new pool. There was no mention of \"if your kid isn't fully potty trained, they can't use the pool\" until AFTER OP had changed her youngest and he was already excited and ready to go swimming. \n\nNow before anyone starts whining about how it's Ava's property, and she has the right to set conditions, yes, she does have that right. It's her property, she can include or exclude anyone she wants. But when you put out an open invitation to all your family members and only set the boundaries AFTER they arrive, that's an asshole move to do.\n\nOP spoke her mind, which FYI she's allowed to do. You don't have to agree with her, but her pointing out that it wasn't fair Ava was singling out her youngest cause \"he's not potty trained\" isn't an entitled point. Also, I completely agree that peeing in pools is disgusting, but despite what most of you are saying, it's a FACT that it is very common for people, kids and adults, to just go in the pool rather than going to the bathroom. I recall heading off to a restroom to relieve myself rather than just going in the pool. But that's what I recall, can't say I never went in the pool as a young child though.\n\nBut at the end, OP didn't try to force her kid into the pool. Yes, she told the other family members. But how else is she supposed to explain why her kid is bawling his eyes out? She also felt unwelcomed after the family essentially sided with her sister. Not to mention she's gotta deal with a 3 year old bawling his eyes out for being ostracized, and yes, he's being ostracized.\n\nAnd then you have the non-apology from Ava, which from at least OP's claim sounds like Ava was gaslighting her. She's basically blaming OP for her feeling like Ava ostracized her kid... which ya know, was what actually happened.\n\nNow, for those who say \"it's not a big deal, the kid is 3, he'll forget it\" please take a moment to think. Yes, kids will forget the \"memory\" of events at young ages. But those \"feelings\" they had will stay with them for the rest of their life.", "NTA.  Its a pool, it gets pee in it.  It gets worms in it. It gets bird poop in it.  It gets dead bugs, dead mice, dead birds in it. It gets decomposing leaves, dirt, pollen, dust, frogs, turtles.  People spill soda, beer, wine, crumbs, sunscreen,  sweat, dandruff,  dead skin,  and blood in it.    \n\ni could pee in my pool 100 times and it wouldn't change the pool chemistry enough for me to detect. \n\nNTA", "While I agree with all that say it's Ava's pool therefore her rules, at the exact same time the way she did it was AH behavior and IMO somewhat trumps OP's response.  Furthermore, her idea that no one is going to pee in the pool is ridiculous.  OP is correct that kids and adults are all going to pee in the pool.  It's going to happen.  The only way for Ava to keep her pool 100% urine free is for only her to use it...as it's a decent chance her husband will piss in it.  Peeing in pools is gross in thought, but the reality is that it's not actually a huge issue (but that doesn't make it ok...no, I don't pee in pools).  If it was a true issue all public pools would be shut down immediately.  Furthermore, the amount of urine that a 3yo is going to urinate is infinitesimally small compared to the 15,000-20,000 gallons of water in the pool.  Ava is making a bigger deal out of this than makes sense.\n\nPersonally, I am going to say NTA purely because of how Ava set it up.  She invited the kids to all come over and swim and then at the last minute pulled the rug on the youngest.  That is AH behavior and as a father of young kids I can understand OP's response...even if it wasn't perfect.", "NTA. Seriously. Little kids have accidents and are not necessarily potty trained by \"a certain age\". They do it when the light bulb goes off in their little head and with A LOT of patience and support. When it happens, it often happens all at once. It's a kid thing. The thing is, OP, your little one was left severally disappointed and sad by his aunt, which is NOT cool. Your froo-froo sister should have warned you well ahead of time. There in NO excuse for that. My kids trained anywhere between 2 & 3, and my grand baby hasnt yet started (still just 2). All this \"my kid did it super early' BS is cool and all, but it's not typical. Kids are gonna kid. And that's okay. But to restrict and disappoint them for a BS reason is, well, BS. Besides, how much urine can a toddler make in gallon upon gallons of sanitized pool water? Pullease.", "Also don't forget reddit is full of literal teens with no real life experience.

It's not piss in a cup, and then pour it on your head. It's piss into thousands  of gallons of water and then dump it on your  head. If you  want to SAY that you still wouldn't do that. Ok, you can say that. If you've ever gone into a pool and submerged, you have basically done that. Also, if that is your standard then no public pools, no lakes, no oceans, no hottubs no nothing for you \nOh and you're really going to hate this. There are probably  also no restaurants (definitely  not fast food) that you can go to by that standard. Maybe the fancier kinds, but anything on par with  \"The Olive Garden\" isn't safe.
