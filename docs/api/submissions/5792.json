I left his house that night in tears. After getting some positive feedback here I showed him some of the comments on this post to see if he would understand why I was so hurt. He texted me angrily in response to my post about family matters in a public forum. I met him and my stepmom at a restaurant to try and have a civil discussion, but that ended in me storming out mid-meal.\n\nI moved in with some friends for a couple months, and then my mom, who I'd had a very poor relationship with since their divorce. I was still financially reliant on my dad at that point so I decided to play nice to avoid any more headaches.\n\nThis was a really unstable time for me emotionally. As he referenced in his text, I have a few mental health diagnoses that mess with my emotional stability and decision making, and I made a lot of poor choices in that first year. I moved across the country, dropped out of school, and moved back to my mom all before December. Once home, I put some effort into re-developig a relationship with him, despite the fact that this situation had never been resolved. Everything came to a head that Christmas when my sisters and I showed up 45 minutes early to celebrate the holiday with our dad. We went upstairs to let them be since they said they weren't ready yet, and a few minutes later my dad came upstairs and asked us to leave. My stepmom was crying downstairs and saying that we ruined her Christmas so we left. They called us to come back before we got more than 10 miles out, but this was the beginning of the end for that marraige. My dad and stepmom divorced a few months after that.\n\nSince all of this my relationship with my dad has improved s bit. We haven't talked much about the original incident, which I think is for the best because he's made clear he disagrees on principle with the reasoning in the comments as to why I was NTA. For years I would have considered him the best dad anyone could ask for; I felt like I lost the most important person in my life, but this whole thing really opened my eyes to his more harmful behavior. I think I have a more realistic perception of things now, even if it still hurts.\n\nI wish this could have been a more positive update, I haven't found the courage to date since this all happened, but I've finally finished school now and I'm set to move away from my family for real this time at the start of the new year, so I'm hoping that will make it easier.\n\nTL;DR: my dad doubled down on supporting my stepmom when she didn't like that I was gay, and then divorced her for something else a year later. My relationship with him was irreparably damaged.", "created_utc": 1672160739, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwkepu/update_aita_for_telling_my_stepbrothers_im_gay/", "score": 254, "replies": ["I'm sorry your dad wasn't there for you and allowed your stepmother to treat you poorly for not being het.

The current pope is a good one - we shouldn\u2019t judge each other\u2019s relationships, marriages, and sexuality.
