I\u2019m exhausted most days so on boys night I was bailing super early at 9 pm. \n\nIan runs his mouth and starts calling me names saying I don\u2019t hustle enough and I\u2019m a beta debtor and all I do is settle. Maybe the 14 hour days finally got to me but I went the fuck off on Ian. I stated everything above and about how he\u2019s homeless and makes it sound like it\u2019s some sort of an adventure. I told him his jeep is gross and he has to go to a gym and shower.

Business can fail, however people will always need EMTs (fellow EMT here). So while he's hustling trying to find ways to make money... you just work as you usually do because you don't need to entice people to buy hospital transportation lol", "NTA", "You were an asshole to an asshole, sure. But it turned out for the best, i guess. You didn't cause his issues; nobody gets checked into a mental health facility because ONE person told them they were losers.", "NTA. Ian started it. How did he expect you to respond to that? Standing up for yourself went a little too far it sounds but it also sounds like he needed to hear it. If he is checked into a mental health facility it wound like that needed to happen anyway", "NTA - Actually, you sound like a good friend. Only good friends will call someone out on their BS. Looks like he has taken it to heart about what you were telling him and now he's getting the help he needs. Lord knows how many times some of my friends have called me out over the years. They helped me become a better person.", "This is a repost of another guy who goes off on his friend in a bar who lives like a hobo in car while bragging about being an entrepreneur \n\nWith some detail changes", "Sounds like you pointed him in the right direction. NTA.", "You did NOT cause Ian's issues.\n\nYou pointed out everything to Ian, that he was aware of, and projecting onto you and probably others.\n\nYour friends were not defending you went he went off on you.  But then they attack you for giving him a taste of his own medicine?  I am not sure these are people you should call friends.\n\nNTA", "Well this Ian is sure not a friend if you need to talk to him like this. For that matter, why you keep him around if he's clearly doing things that he shouldn't. And most of all, he needed a good kick in the right direction which you did as he is now getting the care he needs to get out of that.\n\nFor your friends, no. They are the ones that enable and allow this to continue. No OP, NTA. What you did should be praised as you might have saved his life. Now, I don't see you mention drugs or alcohol so no idea if he has dealings with that. But from how you describe him I wouldn't be surprised if he did. If it is indeed the case, you might indeed have saved him from that as well. With time, he might even thank you as you were the only one that dared to yell at him to get his act together.", "NTA\n\nWhy are you friends with this person?  He sounds like the type that has to put everyone down to make himself look better.  Disgusting behavior all around, but you are not the reason he's in a hospital.  He probably should have been there a long time ago.  \n\nYou could have handled yourself a bit better, but I get it being too much.", "NTA If you throw shade, you better be able to take it.\n\nIan messed around and found out.", "You did not cause his issues.  Ian should've checked in to a mental health facility sooner.  A person doesn't just suddenly develop mental health issues over a comment.  This has been festering for a long time.  You had nothing to do with him going to a mental health facility.  You can bank on that.  This is not your fault.", "NTA. Ian sounds like a real piece of work. Calling you names and belittling your hard work? Fuck that noise. You had every right to put him in his place and call out his bullshit. Mental health issues or not, he needed a reality check. Your friends might not get it, but sometimes tough love is what's needed. Ian's issues aren't your responsibility.", "NTA.\n\nI mean, I guess you were an asshole for saying that. But he is the bigger asshole and sometimes people just need to be called out. I think chronic financial instability is definitely a sign of mental disorder/insecurity and now he is in one of the best positions to correct that.", "NTA.  Apparently, it was the wake up call he needed to hear to get the help for what HE has caused in his life.  You just held up a mirror for him, you didn't cause his issues.", "He probably checked into the facility for a free place to sleep.", "OP maybe could have been more diplomatic, but the way Ian acted excuses his tone completely. Sounds like he gave Ian a much needed reality check. Hopefully it does him some good.", "I agree, you gave him a much needed wake up call."]}
