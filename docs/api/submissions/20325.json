You specifically mention his mother \"hit him with a shoe on the street\" . I know that's considered an insult in dinner places.\n\nI know in some cultures you only date people you think you could marry. Often the parents are involved. Marriage follows a short engagement, babies follow soon after or at least that's what the parents want. \n\nIt seemed like we were missing something in this post.\n\nHowever, OP, you have every right to end it with this person for whatever reason you want.

I want to focus on one part of your situation:\n\n> even though I wanted to move back to my home country, I chose to stay with him and find a job.\n\nI get the impression from some of your answers downthread that your and your (ex?) BF's families are both originally from the same country, but that his family now live in the country where you met at university. If that's the case, then you don't have any immediate family in the country where you live, and he does. IMO, in that case it's crucial for most people to have in-laws who are accepting and supporting of their daughter- or son-in-law. (The exception are couples who are willing to go no- or low-contact with the obnoxious family.)\n\nMy MIL, a New Zealander, met my FIL, an American, in grad school in Hawaii in 1964 and they married about 6 months later. After a bit of time in Taiwan, Canada, and New Zealand, they settled in the US. If her husband's family hadn't been welcoming and supportive, it would have been a lot harder on her to be so far away. Granted, communications are much easier now than then; when she got engaged, she sent her parents a 3-word telegram (\"ENGAGED WRITING LOVE\" and her name), and phone calls were only for births or deaths. But even with basically free phone calls, emails, and video calls, it's hard to be a continent, or even more than a few hundred km, away from your family.\n\nUnless your (ex?) BF is willing to seriously rethink his relationship with his family, especially his mother, it doesn't sound like you are compatible, even if he's good in many other ways. And if the only reason you stayed where you are is for him, you might want to reconsider moving closer to your family.", "NTA.

I'd suggest talking with your boyfriend about his mom. In a calm maner, to show him that her behaviour is way out of normal. Even if you don't see your life with him in the future, you'd make him a favour if you try to open his eyes. Show him this reddit and the comments.
