I have been dating my boyfriend since 6 months now. We studied at university together and even though I wanted to move back to my home country, I chose to stay with him and find a job. Everything was going great until he told his parents about us sometime back. \n\nThe first time I spoke to his mom, she basically was ranting to me for 30 mins straight that we should get married as soon as possible. I didn\u2019t want to be rude or create a scene. So I gently tried to tell her that I\u2019m trying to find a job first and focus on my career for a bit. I told my boyfriend later that I didn\u2019t appreciate her asking us to rush things (we had only been dating for 6 months and I\u2019m just 25!). He spoke to his parents and said that it wont happen again. \n\nThe next time his mom spoke to me on call. It was the same bullshit. This time telling me to have kids soon too. A short while later, they were visiting us. And I basically told her that I didn\u2019t like a few things she mentioned to me over call the last time. She became really hyper and said that it is normal for parents to get involved in their kids lives, marriage and babies. I basically said that in that case, she should talk to her son about it and not me since I\u2019m not her child. \n\nMy boyfriend gave me a lot of shit later for saying that to his mom. He said that \u2018this is how his mom is\u2019 and \u2018this is how things are\u2019 and if I want to be with him then I need to learn to ignore whatever his mom says. Cause afterall, it wasn\u2019t like she was tying my hands and getting me married forcefully.

But, unless you are willing to be in a relationship with a man whose mom rules, his world, and his future, you might want to run. You are getting a glimpse of your future with him. Would you really want in-laws who don\u2019t value your boundaries? And a boyfriend who doesn\u2019t respect you? Because no man will be telling me that I need to learn to ignore what his mom says in order to be with him. Especially if his mom is actively stepping all over my boundaries.\n\nI find it pretty precarious that at six months she thinks it is appropriate to discuss marriage and children.

NTA and go to relationshipadvice", "NTA \n\nCome on. Yes as a parent you're probably involved in your kids life but telling his SO to have babies soon after 6 months of dating is taking it too far. \n\nYou also already set some boundaries with her and she chose to ignore them. I don't think you should be pressured into these things and it's good that you told her already. Honestly your boyfriend should've taken you side because the things she said were really inappropriate.
