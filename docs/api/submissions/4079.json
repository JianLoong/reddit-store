Its great! The kids play with their new toys and the adults can chat about how they got up that morning.\n\nI (27F) divorced my husband (28M) earlier this year. My side of the family knows its a touchy subject because i really really didnt want to lose him. At thanksgiving i was very appreciative because my sister brought something up and my aunt and mom both looked at me and said \"lets not talk about (his name) right now.\" they know how much i want him back. I was just talking to my sisgter last week and I was talking about how badly i want him back and how ill do anything for another chance. I never cheated, nor did he, i just want him back so badly, our kids want us back together too but i dont involve them in that.\n\nMy brother already is on thin ice, and I contimplated not inviting him already because a few weeks ago he was over watching the kids while i got my hair done and he smoked marijuana in the backyard in front of them. I dont even allow beer or a bottle of wine in my house, and ive never smoked, so i was not happy, because he knows this.\n\nWell, he pulled a little prank on me today.\n\nHim and my ex talk and are friendly and he texted me saying that my ex was at my sisters house and they were talking to him about giving me another chance. I asked them if they could ask him if i could come over. they said he said yes.\n\nThey also said i should bring flowers or something. I put on my makeup and did my hair as perfectly as i could and stopped at the store and got the biggest, most beautiful bouquet of flowers i could find, it cost me a lot of money but i didnt care i as just so excited to hopefuly get one step towards getting him back.\n\nI went on the door and i didnt even knock i just went in and he wasnt there. It was just them sitting there and they both just laughed at me. I said \"where is he?\" and she said \"probably with his new girlfriend\" and i said \"he has a girlfriend?\" and my brother and sister just laughed.\n\nI figured out he was never there and it was just a prank. I threw my flowers at them and started crying and drove home.\n\nI texted my mom and said they are no longer welcome to christmas dinner at my house and my mom even agreed that was horrible, but they both swear it was just a joke. It wasnt a joke to me, i cried my eyes out when i got home.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: My mom gave me some advice so I took it and I talked to my husband for the first time in months. We have split custody, but when he drops off/picks up the kids i dont even want to see him because im so heartbroken. \n\nI called him and asked if he has a new girlfriend and he said no. I asked if hes slept with anyone. He said no. \n\nI know this is stupid bit i poured my heart out ti him. I said in the last 5 months ive changed as a woman and im willing to do absolutely anything to get him back. I said ill go to couples therapy, marriage counseling, ill ANYTHING in this world to get him back.\n\nI thought he was going to give me the runaround about how we just werent meant to be, but he actually said we can try marriage counseling. I asked if that means i can be his girlfriend and he said  to \"slow it down\" but if therapy works hell be willing to give it one more try and im so f-ing happy right now i LITERALLY was jumping up and down and squiling like a kid!\n\nim just wondering if i should invite him over for christmas dinner. Idk but im so happy and im just glad today had a happy ending!!!\n\nMy whole family is now choosing sides though and i think i might have been out of line to uninvite my brother and sister. In fact, my sister just planned her own family dinner and sent a group text out to everyone except me INCLUDING MY EX and some of my family is going there, but my mom said she will still spend christmas with me and doesnt think i did anything wrong.", "created_utc": 1670297293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdtt3g/aita_for_uninviting_my_siblings_to_christmas/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a cruel, malicious prank. You need to stop allowing them into your life. I would go full NC after that one.", "NTA -\n\nI'm glad you put on your big girl panties and called your ex directly instead of trying to go through your siblings. \n\nWhat your siblings did was utterly mean, cruel and reprehensible.  They KNEW you were upset about your divorce and wanted your ex back and they made a game of it by humiliating  you at your most vulnerable point.  That's not a harmless 'prank'.  Your siblings ARE AH's. \n\nNow your sister planning a family dinner is just to get back at you.  I hope your ex does not attend that dinner.  \n\nYour siblings owe you an apology. I am wondering if the family that are siding with sister are fully aware of what they did to you and the lengths they went to for this 'prank'.  I doubt they'd find it funny if they were in your shoes. \n\nSome unsolicited advice here - IF you do invite ex to Christmas dinner - please tell the kids that Dad is there to celebrate the holiday with them. Do NOT get their hopes up for   \n a reconciliation yet. GO SLOW. Go to counseling first.   I had friends that separated, got back together, separated, got back together back and forth several times.  It screwed up their kids for a long time. One of them still has issues from it -and he's in his 30's now.  I know you are excited, but PLEASE don't do that to your kids!!!\n\nBest of luck to you.", "NTA- they are both cruel and you have every right to  distance yourself from them", "NTA\n\nYou're right; that's a sick joke to play on someone.  I'm sorry that's happened to you.", "Wow, this is really screwed up. I\u2019m sorry, OP.\n\nIt\u2019s only your business as to why your marriage ended, and it\u2019s awful for your family to make a joke out of it. That is extremely hurtful and not something anyone deserves to deal with.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for uninviting them. You don\u2019t deserve to have to spend your holidays with a selfish group of assholes.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.    Assholes\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\nFrankly, I'd cut them out of my life.\nDisgusting  of them", "NTA. Pranks are meant to be fun. This \u201cprank\u201d was downright cruel. Your brother and sister are AH\u2019s.", "First off, that wasn't a prank, it was crazy cruel.\nSecond, good news about your husband. I'm wishing the best for you. Work hard in therapy!", "Yeah no, thats not a joke. thats just fkd up.  \ncut them out, I think you will look back in a few years and thank your self for standing up for your self here and cutting them out. They're so fkn toxic.   \nSorry you're going through this, but with family like that who needs enemies right?  \nfk that noise.   \nNTA", "Your brother and sister are the assholes. You are so hung up on your ex that you would believe anything that they said. But word of advice, do not tell your kids you are getting back together. And don\u2019t invite him for Christmas. If shit doesn\u2019t go how you fantasize, it will not only hurt you but it will hurt the kids. They are way more important than whatever hallmark movie is going on in your head. NTA", "NTA. Actions have consequences. They played a prank on you knowing full well it might upset you. They had fun at your expense and now they are invalidating your feelings about it. Saying it was just a joke is a way to make it out that you are the one in the wrong (you are too sensitive/silly/don't have a sense of humor etc).\n\nIf it was truly intended as \"just a joke\" they would have apologized and felt terrible about being so cruel. They don't seem to, though.\n\nIf you do invite them and they haven't apologized beforehand, there is a good chance they are going to ruin your Christmas by teasing you about how you reacted.\n\nDon't let social obligation to a couple of assholes ruin your Christmas. F*ck those guys. Let them rot together, just not with you.", "NTA. You are going through something rough and emotional. It seems like your siblings are taking advantage of some easy to press buttons right now and if they can\u2019t respect the boundaries that you\u2019ve already tried to set for the situation then I say it\u2019s your house/party and you can invite who you want. That also means you can not invite those that aren\u2019t serving you in your life right now. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s that there\u2019s a lot of rockiness in my extended family, but I\u2019ve really learned that personally blood doesn\u2019t necessarily make you family. It\u2019s how you treat each other and respect each other.", "Geez. With friends/family like that, who needs enemies?\n\nNTA\n\nThis is beyond the pale. Way beyond. This was mean and cruel. What kind of person does that? They should be ashamed and even a groveling heartfelt apology would be inadequate.", "NTA for rescinding your invitation. Your siblings were unbelievably cruel; it\u2019s only a joke if everyone thinks it\u2019s funny.\n\nBut please slow down with your ex. Since you have children together, take those custody exchange times to talk and see what can be rebuilt. Whatever broke you two up in the first place isn\u2019t going to be fixed overnight. You don\u2019t want to get your kids\u2019 hopes up for a reconciliation that is still tentative.", "First, not funny at all. NTA. Second,  slow down or you'll push your ex away for good.", "NTA and this is one of the cruelest things I've read on here. I honestly wouldn't speak to them again.", "NTA", "NTA but your family is.", "NTA. Your siblings are sadistic asshats. I'm sorry. That's beyond sick.", "NTA. Their actions were hateful and they new they would hurt you.  Don't invite them.  But, also, go to therapy to work on letting go of your ex.  You don't deserve to be held back by him and you need to move forward.", "NTA. I would send a message to the entire family with exactly what you wrote here and let then judge your siblings actions", "NTA. first of all, good luck to you and your ex. second of all your brother and siblings are the asshole and all the family members that go to their dinner also are and i would make sure the rest of the family knows what they did and if they still go you don't deserve them. what they did was cruel. I would make sure that your ex knows what happened. and lastly you have an amazing mother unfortunately we hear so many stories where the mother is on their side and if comes to it, I know it's not what you planned but if it ends up being just you your mother, kids and possibly your ex so be it they are the only ones that truly care about you.", "NTA. That was incredibly cruel. That it ultimately led to something positive is entirely besides the point. \n\nOf course it wasn\u2019t a joke to you. It was upsetting and humiliating, and there\u2019s zero chance would have thought otherwise. There\u2019s no universe in which you would have burst out laughing and been like, \u201chahaha, good one guys,\u201d \\*finger guns\\* \u201cYou got me!\u201d\n\nSo the intent was to be cruel, and they succeeded. Of course you don\u2019t want people who think being cruel to you is funny around, and I wouldn\u2019t want people like that around my kids. Take a break from them, enjoy Christmas, and give your husband a head\u2019s up so he isn\u2019t unwittingly thrown into the middle of this mess.", "NTA. If it was my brother, I wouldn't have a relationship with him anymore.", "NTA \n\nYour siblings did a really cruel thing. That\u2019s messed up. Don\u2019t invite them and have a lovely Christmas dinner with your mom and ex. Your brother and sister sound awful.", "NTA that\u2019s some narcissistic AHery your siblings pulled. They were cruel and then tried to play it off like you\u2019re overreacting??? Um no. Please don\u2019t back down from this. You can be cordial but if you don\u2019t stand firm, they know they can get away with treating you like garbage. \n  In regards to your husband, I\u2019m so very glad that you\u2019re reconnecting. Please take this slow, give him his space, and go to counseling separate and apart. Make sure you have your own therapist as my husband was able to pull the wool over our marriage counselor\u2019s eyes. It took me going to a different therapist for them to help me through things that he was able to convince ME (and the marriage counselor) that I was responsible for. It\u2019s usually both parties responsible for a relationship to go bad.\n  Good luck.", "NTA. Unbelievably messed up. Good luck with your husband. I wouldn\u2019t speak to your siblings.", "NTA. What in the hell were they thinking? A prank? WTF? That's unforgivably cruel and downright evil as fuck... I'm glad you and your husband are trying to work things out but your brother and sister are pure a holes.", "NTA, but you sound like a crazy ex.", "NTA \n\nThere is nothing funny in that joke. \n\nThat is just cruel", "NTA: I am so sorry for and your brother and sister should know better that was just cruel ok them. And they both own you an apology.", "NTA. Absolutely invite him over. He can come over to a house that's dark and locked up and you out celebrating elsewhere. What a great prank! If you really want it to be on the same level as his, though, you'd need someone to slash his tires and then have someone call him to tell him that a person close to him is in the hospital. Just so, you know, he gets the whole painful emotional rollercoaster you got.  Take any cash you would have spent on the AHs for Xmas, and go schedule an hour with a therapist to talk about how to deal with being single and getting past your broken relationship instead.", "NTA. I've never been the type of person to put energy into devising and executing a deeply, intentionally hurtful long-term plan for revenge on someone. But if this happened to me, I think that night change.", "NTA, and sweetie I\u2019m so happy he\u2019s willing to give you a second chance. BOTH of you need to be willing to put in the work to make this relationship work. Marriage is work. It\u2019s hard.
