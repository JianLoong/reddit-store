At first I thought it was great she found a new hobby and was supportive of it, but things have gotten a bit much.\n\nWhenever we go out anywhere, she brings her camera and stops every minute to take photos of flowers, people's houses, street lamps, rubbish, literally anything. It gets annoying because I always have to wait for her to stop taking photos, or if I walk on eventually, she acts like she doesn't even notice and makes no effort to walk alongside me. It's also pretty embarrassing when she's stood outside someone's house for five minutes trying to get a perfect shot, like if someone did that outside my house I'd find it creepy or think they were planning a robbery.\n\nShe also is trying out street photography where you take candid shots of people. I understand it's a legitimate type of photography but it makes me uncomfortable when she takes photos of random strangers when she's with me. She is not very discreet about it and when I ask if she's concerned about people knowing she's taken their photo, she just says she's legally allowed to do so. That may be so but I find it a bit rude or weird to do it without their permission especially when she posts the photos on an instagram account. \n\nI told my girlfriend what I thought the other day because I just wanted to run errands with her without always stopping so she can take photos. I told her there's nothing wrong with her hobby but that its getting a bit annoying when we are out together. She got really upset, saying she's found something she's passionate about and wishes I took more of an interest. She also thought I was mocking her which wasn't my intention. \n\nShe is being withdrawn and distant and I feel I was a bit harsh. I don't want to stop her from doing something she enjoys or put her down but at the same time it was just getting a bit frustrating.

I imagine she'll start being more discreet after she gets yelled at by one of her photography subjects.\n\nNTA. You've even tried to tell her how uncomfortable she's making you. She can be into her hobby AND take your feelings into account. She clearly hasn't figured this out yet though.\n\nIt may take some time for her \"passion\" to burn off but it will. Good communication will go a long way here, just talk to her when she's more receptive and tell her again how her hobby is affecting you then let her decide how to respond.  Maybe start a camera-less date night.", "NTA. While you should support her hobby, that doesn't mean every waking  moment needs to be spent taking photographs. Also, I agree with you about the candid shots. It's intrusive. It would make sense that she take pictures \\*sometimes\\* while at other times leaving the camera at home so that she can focus on spending time with you or doing other things besides photography.", "NTA. Hobbies should have their boundaries. There are instances hobbies can grow into toxic or addictive levels (gaming addiction? anyone?). Also, do verify if taking people's photos without their consent is legal where you live. Even if it is legal, taking photos without consent or the subject not being aware that they are being watched or photographed is assholery, and posting them online is peak assholery. It is plain disrespectful to be taking people's photos without their consent and publishing them. It is also disrespectful to be not careful about your companion's time when you are going to do something together and stopping for long times for the sake of your hobby.", "Info: has she checked whether what she\u2019s doing is legal where you are? Because where I live, there are some distinctions, ie taking photos of strangers in public is allowed but you need to get their consent to share the photos. Also, I believe it is also illegal to take photos of strangers in their homes (for privacy concerns). \n\nI think you\u2019re coming from a good place though, but she needs to understand that there\u2019s a proper place, time and way of pursuing her hobby. NTA", "NTA, she's essentially forcing all of your together time to be her hobby time. Thats not cool.", "NTA it makes you uncomfortable and that\u2019s perfectly fine. \n\nShe can do her hobby on her own time.", "NTA, you aren\u2019t saying she can\u2019t do her hobby, just asking that she not do it every second while you two are together. \n\nAlso, I do not like the street photography thing.", "NTA. You gf is TA for taking people's photos without their consent and posting them. For the other excessive photography, She probably is just excited about the new hobby. You can try communicating with her and have specific days/time where you both are just going out without the camera.", "Hmm. I would say YNTA for being frustrated about her taking photos on every outing. Maybe just clarify that you want to spend quality time with her sometimes and ask whether she can focus on photography on separate occasions. I think that's pretty reasonable.\n\nI think maybe the reason she feels mocked by you is that you perhaps don't understand her interest, which is fine, but I can tell by the post you find it weird she photographs some of the things she does. There are many famous photographers that focus on the mundane and find art in everyday life/people (vivian maier is a classic example). I'm not saying your girlfriend is at their level, and I get it's not everyone's cup of tea, but maybe try not make your girlfriend feel \"weird\" as that could put you into asshole territory. Meet her halfway and make an effort to see some of her photos sometimes if you don't already. \n\nAs for the street photography, that's a tricky one as there's lots of conflicting opinions around it in the photography community. She's right in that it's legal, just sometimes frowned upon. As someone who's done some street photography, my general rules were don't take photos with the purpose of mocking people and don't take photos of children. There's a lot of grey area and no clear right or wrong, but the more experience the photographer gets, they tend to decide for themselves what the best practice is. She might change her approach if she starts being confronted and then ask for permission in the future. But if it makes you uncomfortable when you're out with her, I think she should respect that.", "NTA\nShe sounds like she\u2019s found something she enjoys, which is nice. That said, I\u2019ve been known to dive headfirst into a hobby and block things or people out, and that\u2019s not good.\n\nPerhaps you could offer to take a trip specifically for photography, like a park or botanical garden, and she can explore the hobby at more appropriate times like that?", "NTA.  You've already told her how you feel, and that seems to have gotten you nowhere except being accused of being \"unsupportive.\"  My suggestion would be that from now on you need to separate your outings into 2 categories: camera allowed/encouraged, and no camera.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to run a few simple errands quickly and without fuss.  If she can't understand that, then make it clear that there are certain things you're going to start doing by yourself or with a different friend.", "While she is allowed to photograph people in public, if she is posting them and the people are recognizable, there could be a problem. My \"photography and the law\" class was long ago, but she may want to check out current law on the subject.", "I think not just photography but this is also done by content creators and vloggers etc. That's their profession (in this case her hobby) they have to do it. It depends on the partner whether they are okay with this or not and at the end both have to adjust and compromise.", "NTA.  She is violating societal rules.  Yes, she is legally allowed to take pictures, but that doesn't mean someone won't try to kick your ass over it at some point.\n\nShe needs to pursue her hobby in a more socially acceptable manner.", "NAH \n\nI can see how this getting annoying for you, but I understand that she has found a new passion. If you keep on her she will just go out without you.", "YTA. I was gunna say YNTA but on second thoughts, she's just been gifted a new camera, it seems she's just practising and experimenting with it. If the issue persists, I get she should compromise, but the frequent photo taking is probably the initial excitement of a new hobby.\n\nMost of your post talks about how you feel embarrassed and how weird your girlfriend's behaviour is. You say yourself she feels mocked by you so obviously she can tell she's being judged. I think there's definitely two sides to this story.\n\nMaybe your girlfriend is actually a gifted photographer or has the potential to be idk.", "YTA.  Your girlfriend has a new hobby that she's excited about and you are making it about you. Of course YTA.", "YTA, seems like no one has confronted her about it yet? So no harm no foul other than it just annoying you \n\nShe\u2019s valid in being distant if she feels like her partner isn\u2019t supportive of her endeavors", "ESH - You should let her take photos. The candid thing is creepy and she should stop.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think it's fair that she wants to be able to practice her hobby, and I think part of your discomfort is your own self-consciousness and the feeling that it's an intrusion into your plans more than anything else. Maybe you guys could have some photography free outings, and some where photography along the way is part of the plan.", "NTA, you just need to mix it up a bit.\n\nStart making special trips out together just for her to take photos. Go to a park or flower garden and just stroll around while you talk about your day/week. Let her take all the time she wants because you don't really have a destination or a timeline. Part of the adventure could be you trying to surprise her with good locations.\n\nSo propose a compromise. That you will occasionally take her out for photography sessions if she doesn't take as many pictures when you are out trying to get errands done.", "If she keeps getting into photography she\u2019ll hopefully find that this is a long-running and nuanced ethical issue. I used to shoot street photography but stopped because I came to the conclusion that it was an inappropriate violation of folks\u2019 personal space and privacy. Consent is important and it can be very upsetting to be photographed without permission. Some street photogs will strike up conversation with a subject and build rapport before asking permission to take a portrait - you can get beautiful images that aren\u2019t candid, despite what the purists say. I also bring my camera/s with me selectively based on the situation, and ask before bringing it to events with paid photographers (weddings mostly). Not every walk needs to be a photo walk, and sometimes my friends wanna hang out without worrying how they\u2019ll look in a candid shot. Maybe she\u2019s in the honeymoon phase with the hobby and could use some mentorship from other photographers\u2026 maybe OP can suggest that as a redirection. I agree, NTA!", "Some cultures also believe that taking a photo is stealing your soul", "If you have ever liked any single historical photograph, regardless of the event, that had anyone in it who wasn't a modeling subject, then you are a hypocrite", "I'm extremely passionate about many things. I also have self awareness to realize when my wife is waiting on me, and I don't allow myself to get distracted and annoy my SO.\n\nNote that OP is not saying he hates her taking pictures, just that it is ALL the time. They can't even go for a walk without the camera in tow.\n\nYou can't see how frustrating that is when it's continual?", "So no matter what OP's girlfriend does, He shouldn't be uncomfortable? She takes people's photographs without their consent, Lot of people will feel uncomfortable with that.", "Let\u2019s replace photography with literally anything else. What if her new hobby was video games, and she was stuck to her phone or a switch every second they were together? What if she got really interested in fashion and she only wanted to hang out and have him sit there and watch her sew every second? He\u2019s not asking her to give up the hobby, just to focus on him when they\u2019re trying to spend time together.", "Hmmmm. what does not yet being confronted have to do with the fact that her actions make HIM uncomfortable? Support goes both way in a relationship.  He hasn\u2019t asked her to stop completely - he\u2019s voiced that certain situations are awkward for  him.  She should be mature enough to respect that.", "This. I don't think the girlfriend is as much of an asshole or a creep as people are making her out to be, she's in the honeymoon phase and hasn't found her feet yet. Getting into street photography is really confusing, when I first got into photography I did lots of it and it's what people I followed on social media were doing too. I personally think it's a good artform as it can capture the beauty or personality of everyday people and it can also show people 100 years from now what life used to be like. But I'm of the opinion it's better to ask for permission, or if you really want a candid shot, ask the subject if it's OK if you can keep the photo after you take it. It takes a lot of confidence to approach people like that, but if you say you're a photography student, it's a bit easier. Maybe give her that tip OP and see if she's open to it.", "in the age of tik tok videos no one really cares", "\"Whenever we go out anywhere, she brings her camera and stops every minute to take photos of flowers, people's houses, street lamps, rubbish, literally anything. It gets annoying because I always have to wait for her to stop taking photos, or if I walk on eventually, she acts like she doesn't even notice and makes no effort to walk alongside me.\"\n\nLet's be honest, it isn't about taking candid photos of people.  He's just putting his own ego ahead of her new interest.  If he had a new interest I suspect he wouldn't think stopping every few minutes to indulge it would be an imposition on her.  It's new, she'll get past the initial blush soon enough.", "She\u2019s not living to make HIM comfortable, if she\u2019s partaking in a hobby that doesn\u2019t seem to bother anyone other than him, that\u2019s his personal issue \n\nHer withdrawing makes perfect sense because how is she supposed to feel? What\u2019s next, the way she drinks her water makes him uncomfortable? She isn\u2019t living for him, she\u2019s living for herself, and if he\u2019s the only one that has an issue with her hobby, she\u2019s 100 percent valid in withdrawing", "Bullshit. \n\nThere's a time and place. And just like wood carving or pole dancing wouldnt be acceptable in the middle of a date, neither is is stopping to take pictures all the damn time.", "Ridiculous take is ridiculous.", "He told her he was going to run errands without her and explained why.  She got her knickers in a twist and got offended and started to withdraw.   By your logic, he should have kept his mouth shut and dealt with being uncomfortable?  So he needs to live his life for HER comfort\u2026..I see. NOT.", "Yup, if they were important and time sensitive errands he could\u2019ve just gone and done them, but he brought up her photography for no reason other than to discourage her from what she enjoys \n\nHe specifically points how strangers and how creepy it can look as she\u2019s taking pictures of houses, he\u2019s scared of how others are perceiving them and wants her to share that same fear, so it\u2019s not wonder why she\u2019d want to withdraw from a fearful person if she\u2019s choosing to partake in something that is taking her out of her comfort zone\n\nAnd it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise if she wants to be with someone else who will support her in whatever she wishes to do, so long as it\u2019s not harming anyone, which she isn\u2019t doing", "What the hell are you even talking about? This is a ridiculous take."]}
