It gets annoying because I always have to wait for her to stop taking photos, or if I walk on eventually, she acts like she doesn't even notice and makes no effort to walk alongside me.

I imagine she'll start being more discreet after she gets yelled at by one of her photography subjects.\n\nNTA. You've even tried to tell her how uncomfortable she's making you. She can be into her hobby AND take your feelings into account. She clearly hasn't figured this out yet though.\n\nIt may take some time for her \"passion\" to burn off but it will. Good communication will go a long way here, just talk to her when she's more receptive and tell her again how her hobby is affecting you then let her decide how to respond.  Maybe start a camera-less date night.", "NTA. While you should support her hobby, that doesn't mean every waking  moment needs to be spent taking photographs. Also, I agree with you about the candid shots. It's intrusive. It would make sense that she take pictures \\*sometimes\\* while at other times leaving the camera at home so that she can focus on spending time with you or doing other things besides photography.", "NTA. Hobbies should have their boundaries. There are instances hobbies can grow into toxic or addictive levels (gaming addiction? anyone?). Also, do verify if taking people's photos without their consent is legal where you live. Even if it is legal, taking photos without consent or the subject not being aware that they are being watched or photographed is assholery, and posting them online is peak assholery. It is plain disrespectful to be taking people's photos without their consent and publishing them. It is also disrespectful to be not careful about your companion's time when you are going to do something together and stopping for long times for the sake of your hobby.", "Info: has she checked whether what she\u2019s doing is legal where you are? Because where I live, there are some distinctions, ie taking photos of strangers in public is allowed but you need to get their consent to share the photos. Also, I believe it is also illegal to take photos of strangers in their homes (for privacy concerns). \n\nI think you\u2019re coming from a good place though, but she needs to understand that there\u2019s a proper place, time and way of pursuing her hobby. NTA", "NTA, she's essentially forcing all of your together time to be her hobby time. Thats not cool.", "NTA it makes you uncomfortable and that\u2019s perfectly fine. \n\nShe can do her hobby on her own time.", "NTA, you aren\u2019t saying she can\u2019t do her hobby, just asking that she not do it every second while you two are together. \n\nAlso, I do not like the street photography thing.", "NTA. You gf is TA for taking people's photos without their consent and posting them. For the other excessive photography, She probably is just excited about the new hobby. You can try communicating with her and have specific days/time where you both are just going out without the camera.", "Hmm. I would say YNTA for being frustrated about her taking photos on every outing. Maybe just clarify that you want to spend quality time with her sometimes and ask whether she can focus on photography on separate occasions. I think that's pretty reasonable.\n\nI think maybe the reason she feels mocked by you is that you perhaps don't understand her interest, which is fine, but I can tell by the post you find it weird she photographs some of the things she does. There are many famous photographers that focus on the mundane and find art in everyday life/people (vivian maier is a classic example). I'm not saying your girlfriend is at their level, and I get it's not everyone's cup of tea, but maybe try not make your girlfriend feel \"weird\" as that could put you into asshole territory. Meet her halfway and make an effort to see some of her photos sometimes if you don't already. \n\nAs for the street photography, that's a tricky one as there's lots of conflicting opinions around it in the photography community. She's right in that it's legal, just sometimes frowned upon. As someone who's done some street photography, my general rules were don't take photos with the purpose of mocking people and don't take photos of children. There's a lot of grey area and no clear right or wrong, but the more experience the photographer gets, they tend to decide for themselves what the best practice is. She might change her approach if she starts being confronted and then ask for permission in the future. But if it makes you uncomfortable when you're out with her, I think she should respect that.", "NTA\nShe sounds like she\u2019s found something she enjoys, which is nice. That said, I\u2019ve been known to dive headfirst into a hobby and block things or people out, and that\u2019s not good.\n\nPerhaps you could offer to take a trip specifically for photography, like a park or botanical garden, and she can explore the hobby at more appropriate times like that?", "NTA.  You've already told her how you feel, and that seems to have gotten you nowhere except being accused of being \"unsupportive.\"  My suggestion would be that from now on you need to separate your outings into 2 categories: camera allowed/encouraged, and no camera.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to run a few simple errands quickly and without fuss.  If she can't understand that, then make it clear that there are certain things you're going to start doing by yourself or with a different friend.", "While she is allowed to photograph people in public, if she is posting them and the people are recognizable, there could be a problem. My \"photography and the law\" class was long ago, but she may want to check out current law on the subject.", "I think not just photography but this is also done by content creators and vloggers etc. That's their profession (in this case her hobby) they have to do it. It depends on the partner whether they are okay with this or not and at the end both have to adjust and compromise.", "NTA.  She is violating societal rules.  Yes, she is legally allowed to take pictures, but that doesn't mean someone won't try to kick your ass over it at some point.\n\nShe needs to pursue her hobby in a more socially acceptable manner.", "NAH \n\nI can see how this getting annoying for you, but I understand that she has found a new passion. If you keep on her she will just go out without you.", "YTA. I was gunna say YNTA but on second thoughts, she's just been gifted a new camera, it seems she's just practising and experimenting with it. If the issue persists, I get she should compromise, but the frequent photo taking is probably the initial excitement of a new hobby.\n\nMost of your post talks about how you feel embarrassed and how weird your girlfriend's behaviour is. You say yourself she feels mocked by you so obviously she can tell she's being judged. I think there's definitely two sides to this story.\n\nMaybe your girlfriend is actually a gifted photographer or has the potential to be idk.", "YTA.  Your girlfriend has a new hobby that she's excited about and you are making it about you. Of course YTA.", "YTA, seems like no one has confronted her about it yet? So no harm no foul other than it just annoying you \n\nShe\u2019s valid in being distant if she feels like her partner isn\u2019t supportive of her endeavors", "ESH - You should let her take photos.

I think it's fair that she wants to be able to practice her hobby, and I think part of your discomfort is your own self-consciousness and the feeling that it's an intrusion into your plans more than anything else. Maybe you guys could have some photography free outings, and some where photography along the way is part of the plan.", "NTA, you just need to mix it up a bit.\n\nStart making special trips out together just for her to take photos. Go to a park or flower garden and just stroll around while you talk about your day/week. Let her take all the time she wants because you don't really have a destination or a timeline. Part of the adventure could be you trying to surprise her with good locations.\n\nSo propose a compromise. That you will occasionally take her out for photography sessions if she doesn't take as many pictures when you are out trying to get errands done.", "If she keeps getting into photography she\u2019ll hopefully find that this is a long-running and nuanced ethical issue. I used to shoot street photography but stopped because I came to the conclusion that it was an inappropriate violation of folks\u2019 personal space and privacy. Consent is important and it can be very upsetting to be photographed without permission. Some street photogs will strike up conversation with a subject and build rapport before asking permission to take a portrait - you can get beautiful images that aren\u2019t candid, despite what the purists say. I also bring my camera/s with me selectively based on the situation, and ask before bringing it to events with paid photographers (weddings mostly). Not every walk needs to be a photo walk, and sometimes my friends wanna hang out without worrying how they\u2019ll look in a candid shot. Maybe she\u2019s in the honeymoon phase with the hobby and could use some mentorship from other photographers\u2026 maybe OP can suggest that as a redirection. I agree, NTA!", "Some cultures also believe that taking a photo is stealing your soul", "If you have ever liked any single historical photograph, regardless of the event, that had anyone in it who wasn't a modeling subject, then you are a hypocrite", "I'm extremely passionate about many things.

They can't even go for a walk without the camera in tow.\n\nYou can't see how frustrating that is when it's continual?", "So no matter what OP's girlfriend does, He shouldn't be uncomfortable? She takes people's photographs without their consent, Lot of people will feel uncomfortable with that.", "Let\u2019s replace photography with literally anything else. What if her new hobby was video games, and she was stuck to her phone or a switch every second they were together? What if she got really interested in fashion and she only wanted to hang out and have him sit there and watch her sew every second? He\u2019s not asking her to give up the hobby, just to focus on him when they\u2019re trying to spend time together.", "Hmmmm. what does not yet being confronted have to do with the fact that her actions make HIM uncomfortable? Support goes both way in a relationship.  He hasn\u2019t asked her to stop completely - he\u2019s voiced that certain situations are awkward for  him.  She should be mature enough to respect that.", "This. I don't think the girlfriend is as much of an asshole or a creep as people are making her out to be, she's in the honeymoon phase and hasn't found her feet yet. Getting into street photography is really confusing, when I first got into photography I did lots of it and it's what people I followed on social media were doing too. I personally think it's a good artform as it can capture the beauty or personality of everyday people and it can also show people 100 years from now what life used to be like. But I'm of the opinion it's better to ask for permission, or if you really want a candid shot, ask the subject if it's OK if you can keep the photo after you take it. It takes a lot of confidence to approach people like that, but if you say you're a photography student, it's a bit easier. Maybe give her that tip OP and see if she's open to it.", "in the age of tik tok videos no one really cares", "\"Whenever we go out anywhere, she brings her camera and stops every minute to take photos of flowers, people's houses, street lamps, rubbish, literally anything.

He's just putting his own ego ahead of her new interest.  If he had a new interest I suspect he wouldn't think stopping every few minutes to indulge it would be an imposition on her.  It's new, she'll get past the initial blush soon enough.", "She\u2019s not living to make HIM comfortable, if she\u2019s partaking in a hobby that doesn\u2019t seem to bother anyone other than him, that\u2019s his personal issue \n\nHer withdrawing makes perfect sense because how is she supposed to feel?

NOT.", "Yup, if they were important and time sensitive errands he could\u2019ve just gone and done them, but he brought up her photography for no reason other than to discourage her from what she enjoys \n\nHe specifically points how strangers and how creepy it can look as she\u2019s taking pictures of houses, he\u2019s scared of how others are perceiving them and wants her to share that same fear, so it\u2019s not wonder why she\u2019d want to withdraw from a fearful person if she\u2019s choosing to partake in something that is taking her out of her comfort zone\n\nAnd it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise if she wants to be with someone else who will support her in whatever she wishes to do, so long as it\u2019s not harming anyone, which she isn\u2019t doing", "What the hell are you even talking about? This is a ridiculous take.", "NTA My daughter is a photographer. She doesn't take photos of people without asking and doesn't invade the privacy of peoples homes. She doesn't take her pro camera everywhere, on every outing. I went with her on  photo shoots twice to a historic area, she warned me beforehand it was a photo shoot and I need to be patient. (Which I was, because I knew what I was getting into) It's fun to watch a talented artist at work , but not all the freaking time! I don't blame you for being bothered.", "NTA. Regardless of any ethical issues of taking pics of people or private property without consent, this sounds exasperating to deal with on the regular. A one-time cool event for photos, like a hot air balloon festival or something, I'd give some grace and be patient, but every single time you go in public? That's exhausting.", "Just because she can, doesn't mean she should. Something being legal doesn't make it mostly/ethically legal right. \nNTA. She could do her hobby sometimes, but all the time.

Being legally permitted to do something doesn\u2019t make it not creepy or rude.\n\nMy mom lives in a beautiful house she designed herself and people often knock on the door to ask to take photos for their art or inspiration for their own renovations.

He said \"I'm so sorry, I didn't really think, is this boring for you?\" and I explained, it's not boring all the time but every single walk is a bit much for me. \n\nJust explain that whilst you are happy she's found a passion, could you please have \"camera walks\" and non-camera walks, or meet her after she's been out with the camera as its unfair to you and your time", "You are altering your life constantly to please her.

If it's a deal-breaker for you, then find another GF. Otherwise, this one has found her passion......", "NTA in general for the whole situation, but it sounds like you handled it poorly. For one thing, calling your gf annoying is not the most diplomatic way to describe how you are feeling, and you should be supportive of her hobby. The conversation could have started like this: \"I think it's great that you have found a new hobby that you love, and I appreciate how dedicated you are to it. I do feel, however, that it can sometimes get in the way of our time together, and you taking photos of random people without their consent makes me uncomfortable. Would you be open to setting aside some \"us\" time where we can leave the camera at home, or maybe we can dedicate specific times to photography?", "Yep.... if you smhad said she was taking pictures of every bite of food on her phone then we could debate. But this? Fix yourself my guy", "I'm gonna get downvoted into oblivion but here I go. A very very soft ESH but your girlfriend sucks more than you. You should be more supportive and understanding of her new hobby, I love photography and I mostly photograph nature (did a couple of weddings as well cause i have a knack for portraits & candids) and when I got my first camera i wanted to shoot everything (not strangers on the street tho). It's also how you find your style. So it's a honeymoon phase for her and from your post, I don't get the sense that you understand how happy/excited she is. This is important to her. \n\nHaving said that, it sounds like she's into the \"everything deserves to be photographed\" phase and while that may be part of photography as a new hobby, if you're doing it for the enjoyment of photography, you look at something and feel something inside you that tells you this is a moment or something worth preserving. But from what you wrote, it strikes me as your GF is doing it mostly to have social media content. And she can do that but there's a way to do it. Putting up random shit isn't a photographer-make.\n\nShe might also need to double check the law where you live. I live in Sweden and while it's legal to photograph a person on the street, you need their consent to post it online because of GDPR. And you were right on the money, if I'm in my apartment and someone is outside taking a picture of me, that's illegal amd creepy. There isn't really much discussion here. Also, just cause something is legal doesn't automatically make it okay. There's a moral aspect here. If she saw a person crying, would she take their photo in a vulnerable moment cause \"art\"?\n\n\nMy point is, you need to communicate. You need to explain to her that she's too busy photographing life instead of actually living it. You also need to tell her to double check the legality and also her moral compass. What if she fell down in public and someone snapped a photo and put it online? Or if she's in the middle of a sneeze? Or if she's having a bad hair day or her hair is a mess in a storm? Is she really comfortable with being photographed in ALL situations? Because that's what she's doing to people.\n\nYou can help her by advising her to start with finding what interests her. What is it that she's trying to say with her picture? Two people can photograph the exact same thing but both of them won't produce the same result. Right now it seems like she takes a photo and thinks \"this will look good on my Instagram\" or \"i wonder how many followers this will get me\". If she's really interested in making it on social media, the key is to find a niche or two otherwise she's just a grandma putting up random pictures online.\n\n Photography is art. It's a language you speak & something you feel. It's how you show the world how you see it. It's about knowing the balance between living in the moment and capturing it. So I think both of you need to actually understand what photography is about. sorry about the essay.

My husband has a similar conversation with me. We have certain outings that I'll focus on photography and then others at most cellphone shots.

You will need to make a hard decision to not say anything to her about her photography because clearly she has heard a lot from you and now may be blocking you mentally when you speak. She also seems to have an attitude with everything. If you happen to be together and she goes in her zone, just walk away and she will find her way.  When she asks, then you can mention finding a mentor to help her fine tune her skills. Or how her action, be specific and use current situation, was affecting whatever you were both doing. Trying to reach her when she is not listening, only creates more problems.", "NTA. She should just go out to take pictures, and other days go out with you. Taking photos of private property without the consent of the owner is illegal.", "NTA\n\nMaybe you can suggest a compromise where she doesn't do it when you are running errands and you will commit to going for walks around town just for her photography?", "NTA. She needed to hear that. It's annoying to you. That should matter.", "NTA- she\u2019s the AH for taking pictures of people without their consent", "I think this is the same way I would've felt, I don't think you're an asshole at all. I think you are very reasonable.", "NTA. How about you suggest outings that are designed to be for photography so you can show her that you support her passion and other outings that are camera free?", "Honestly I can't stand it when people constantly take pictures of themselves or wherever they are. Just enjoy the moment you're in stop worrying about your socials.", "NTA\n  I would be pissed as hell if I caught someone taking my picture. I would absolutely confront the person. And if I found out they had posted it??? Honey meet my lawyer. She is being a rude AH and yes id definitely run anyone off taking pics of my house. She is going to get herself shot doing this to the wrong person.", "NTA\n\nTime and place. Also photography has to be ethical. If i see you taking pics of me or to my house for a while i would be definitely calling the police.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who used to do this and take a ton of nature photos any time we went out for a walk, I realize now how annoying that is. My enthusiasm eventually petered out and then my camera broke so...yeah haha. Though I do take photos still with my phone but not nearly as much.\n\nI think that eventually this honeymoon phase of love and excitement will eventually fade, and she will either change her photo taking habits, or no longer be interested in it. I know I am the type of person to become really excited and into hobbies real fast, then it just goes away and I am not longer interested.\n\nThe taking photos of people in public has always made me extremely uncomfortable. Yes, technically it's legal, and you are in a public place and theres video cameras everywhere blah blah blah, but I think there's a difference between surveillance cameras and some random person taking your photo and having it in their own private collection. It seems really intrusive and wrong and honestly creepy to me. Without consent anyways. Asking the person and getting consent is different.\n\nHopefully her enthusiasm will slowly fade away, and at the very least the amount of photos being taken will not be so crazy heavy. And hopefully she learns how to be a more ethical and kind photographer when it comes to strangers.\n\nI also disagree that partners need to have interest in what their partner likes. Your partner should be encouraging or at least okay with the hobby, but they in no way need to like to do it or enjoy it the same way.\n\nI would perhaps ask her to look around for photography clubs in your area, that way she can get together every week or whatever with like minded people. They just go around taking photos of whatever they want and share in them, and share techniques and stuff. It's a great way for her to get better at it, and find people who enjoy the hobby as much as she does. There is no reason for you to be on board with her taking 100's of photos every time you go out.\n\nEdit: I would also add to this in that...does she take photos of people's houses? Like actually their houses? Because I would look up the laws about that, to me that is no longer public property and she shouldn't be doing that. I never take photos of people's lawns or houses or anything, mostly because I think that is so incredibly creepy and stalkery. Like...I woul dnever want someone taking a photo of my house. What if I'm standing in the window or doing something private?", "She needed the reality check as far as your ethical concern goes. Sounds like she\u2019s not hearing it but as other commenters have pointed out, she will probably offend someone and get yelled at one day and maybe she will learn. \n\nAs far as you not being supportive of her hobby or whatever, that\u2019s bs. My hobby is painting. Do I bring a canvas, easel, and brushes with me and stop to paint a few strokes every 2 minutes while out and about with my boyfriend? Hobbies are what you do for fun. Not something you interject into your normal activities all day long. She can make \u201cartist dates\u201d for herself where she goes out with the purpose of taking pictures. You don\u2019t need to be there. Especially if it\u2019s making you uncomfortable.", "NTA. \n\nEven if she legally can, that doesn't mean it's not disrespectful to take pictures of someone that didn't consent to it. The same goes for other people's property. One very important part of being a good photographer is to know what's appropriate and what isn't.\n\nAs for the outings, maybe you need to have outings specifically for her to do pictures. Aside from those outings, ask her to not bring the camera because YOU want her attention.", "YTA especially because you're probably somewhere that doesn't require two part consent.", "OP NTA, and I\u2019d try this angle with your gf regarding the street photography:   there\u2019s a huge risk to domestic violence survivors if their picture is taken and posted on social media. Their abuser absolutely could see it and use the background to figure out where they are. It\u2019s happened before, I know several people for whom it\u2019s a big concern, and maybe framing it as a safety issue will get through to her.", "You\u2019re legally allowed to be an asshole too, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should make a hobby out of it.  OP you\u2019re NTA, but I really think your GF is.  I don\u2019t want mine or my child\u2019s image on social media.  I know it may not be totally avoidable as I live on a planet with others who don\u2019t care, but maybe they\u2019ll understand when someone blatantly ignores their consent and boundaries.", "Nta I feel your pain. My husband acts the same way since he got a new camera. He set us up a date night at an art exhibit then spent every second trying to get the perfect shot. He almost seemed annoyed when I wanted him to sit by me and actually converse with me, like I was interrupting his perfect shot!! Annoying. I agree with the suggestion of having some cameraless date nights. Oh ya... And then also wanting to show me hundreds of photos that almost seemed kind of just normal.. And wanting to critique them.. Or me to..", "I agree.  The camera does not need to go on every outing.  Maybe op can agree to every other outing, with the understanding that he will walk ahead and wait if he gets uncomfortable.", "Photojournalists are assholes then?  You don\u2019t ever enjoy street photography?", "Yes! You're legally permitted to take my photo in public and I'm legally permitted to make a scene, embarrass you, and demand you delete the photo. :)", "Lol that made me laugh! I would like to say she is a thoughtful person and she doesn't typically want me to alter her life around hers, but she goes into a \"zone\" sometimes and hyperfocuses on her hobbies. I hope she will come around.", "My girlfriend was talking about transitioning to film", "Woah woah.  Committing to quality time?  He just wants to complete a 20 minute walk to run errands in under an hour. Let's not get carried away /s", "[deleted]", "I do photography as a hobby and my husband is getting into woodworking. We love each others hobbies,  we put my photography on the walls and are getting some vintage furniture for him to refinish for the home. He likes to help with photo composition ideas now and when we go to antique stores and flea markets I will look for router bits and anything I think he might be interested in. Support each others hobbies!", "I still love my girlfriend and she's actually a kind thoughtful person so I disagree it's run its course, she just gets hyperfixated on things and sometimes lacks self awareness (we've considered she might be on the spectrum)", "Probably because the girlfriend brings a camera to take pictures at the grocery store and of people", "But it's not her work? It's her hobby and she's experimenting and having fun.\n\nOP yta because this wasn't about the extra time it takes to do things, you made her feel bad and judged and like she was doing something embarrassing. If it was just about the time like someone else said you could have just gone to run errands on your own. Or even if you really had to say something I don't see why you couldn't have just said \"hey I know you're really into your new camera but I just want to take a quick trip to pick up xyz, would you mind leaving it at home?\"\n\nYou were a jerk.", "We live in an area with high crime rates so probably lol", "All OP was asking is that she doesnt bring her camera everywhere they go, how is that unreasonable? He didnt bash her hobby", "Yeah, I\u2019ve been the object of street photography a few times, and I said something, mostly because they were trying to act like they weren\u2019t doing it so it was weird. I was like, \u201cjust ask.\u201d If someone is doing it with their phone and I notice, I put my hand up haha. \n\nIn fairness, I was a lot more open to it when my little old man dog was still alive. The last year or so of his life, his arthritis got pretty bad and he couldn\u2019t be alone too long, so he rode in a dog wagon, a dog backpack, or a dog stroller whenever I was out. He was a cute little shih tzu who often wore a little shark onesie, and everyone recognized him and stopped to say hello. He was a very social pup and brought joy to folks until the end, so I was always happy to let photographers say hello and photograph him!", "This is all I have to offer you \ud83c\udfc5\nThat's all the stuff I was thinking.", "Exactly, plus there\u2019s a huge risk to domestic violence survivors if their picture is taken and posted on social media.  Their abuser absolutely could see it and use the background to figure out where they are.  It\u2019s happened before", "Lots of people shoot street photography, it\u2019s a pretty well accepted thing in photography really.", "Some cultures did believe that. You're not going to run into a member of any culture that still actively believes that unless you're on the edge of the Amazon rainforest or something.", "I honestly don't understand why you're getting down voted. You're absolutely right. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Photojournalists get consent from their subjects.", "So what is your issue here?", "I was thinking about myself. No way I could ever deal with something as annoying as that.", "Yes plenty of ppl care. I care. I don\u2019t want to be in anyones videos or photos. Ever. It\u2019s bullshit and the laws need to catch up with the tech.\n\nJust bc YOU don\u2019t care about privacy, doesn\u2019t mean others don\u2019t.

Doesn't mean it's socially acceptable.", "Does that mean that they have the right to violate the privacy of others?  Just because something is accepted doesn\u2019t always mean it\u2019s morally right.", "As a photographer from a family of photographers, no, it is not \"pretty well accepted.\" You should ask your subjects for permission to shoot them, especially if you'll be posting or publishing it.", "Instead of downvoting, how about you check out the art that results from it. r/streetphotography", "Not so. I was taking Capoeira about 15 years ago, and one of the guys who was training there still believed this. His whole family does.", "Many old order Amish still believe this as well, and they're very common where I live.", "Or Amish.", "No more laws please. I agree that it is annoying but no more laws... We have plenty and don't need to add to it. Next thing I'll be getting sued cause i took a pic of my wife and son and you were way in the back ground. I do my best to keep others out of my photos but I'm not stopping people from walking and you aren't the focal point. Maybe street photography where you are is worse but it's not a problem where i live. The scenery is more interesting than the people, and if the people are more interesting than they want you to take their picture.", "I mean you are in public, you are constantly being recorded by CCTV and other things like that, you have no right to privacy in public.", "It absolutely is accepted, whether you like it or not candid street photography is an accepted art.", "It\u2019s very easy now to simply remove ppl from pictures though. If someone is blatantly taking pictures/vids without asking others something should be done. I\u2019m not talking about pics where someone is walking by in the distance.

But they wouldn\u2019t want that bc they WANT to annoy others", "You've enacted a logical fallacy here called the \"slippery slope\" fallacy.\n\nHaving laws about public photography of strangers does not mean you're gonna get sued for taking photos of your family if someone happens to be in the background.", "I accept that.  But surveillance is very different than someone deciding they are going to take my picture and use it without my consent.", "Tbf, many people would disagree. There should be some degree to a right to privacy in public. Plus, personally, I don't like the fact that we're all always being surveilled in public. I don't like being recorded, constantly, by cctv and other things.", "I understand that and agree with you, but it would have to be a very specifically and well-written law. Plus our society is so litigious these days it would be abused. There's zero doubt in my mind. And since I finally replaced my old phone, it is very easy to remove people. That's a great point. I forget that because I've been using an older phone for a couple of months now", "It doesn't mean you won't either. Unless it is very well written, people will get sued for bullshit", "Unless you are extremely proactive about securing your personal data, silicon valley knows literally everything about you down to your physical location at any given time and is constantly using all that data without your consent.  I get that it can fell weird or invasive to have your photo taken by a stranger, but in reality that photo is a drop in the ocean.", "You do not have privacy, you are in public.", "Unfortunately, really it's not. You have zero rights to expectation of privacy basically the second you walk out your door.
