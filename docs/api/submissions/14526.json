Anne's husband was the one to have to make the decision of whether to save the child or to save his wife and he chose Anne (this is of course a very simplified version of events). They are both still very traumatized by the whole ordeal but when I talked to them at the time, they agreed that her husband had made the right decision.\n\nNow Laura is up in arms about this - she is about to deliver any day now and says Anne's husband made the wrong decision. That she would not be able to live with herself if her husband made the same one, that the child comes first. I asked her if she had talked to her husband about this and she said yes, but that apparently he did not agree with her and that they had fought about this quite a lot. I just told her that if it came down to it, I would want my partner to make the same decision as well, honestly. She said I don't understand because I don't have children. \n\nWe dropped the subject because she was getting really really upset. I told my mum about the discussion and she said I was TA for getting Laura so upset and for saying something so crude (see title).

Sometimes this includes delivering the baby earlier than is ideal, but until the baby is delivered, mum is the priority. Once the baby is delivered, it\u2019s an entirely separate team of doctors working on the baby (obstetricians for mum, paediatricians for baby). \n\nThe only exception I can think of is asking a pregnant woman to have a termination to allow for chemotherapy, but that isn\u2019t an emergency decision- it can be talked over for days with various specialists/counsellors etc.", "NTA that's an extremely personal decision. It's okay that Laura has a preference, she knows what choice she would want made and that's okay. What's not okay is for Laura to criticize Anne's husband for choosing differently and claiming that only her choice is the correct choice. She is literally saying that she think's Anne should have died instead, and that's just a sucky thing to say about anyone, let alone morally grandstand. Laura was being cruel with what she was saying even if she never to Anne or her husband her thoughts. \n\nYou're mom is wrong on this, you weren't saying it to be crude, you were being honest to make a point and defend your friend and her husband who went through something terrible", "NTA, besides making a pregnant woman upset, perhaps should have dropped her sooner. \n\nBesides that, your friend has serious issues if she believes an unborn child is more important than a fully grown adult. I might be stating it bluntly, but it\u2019s the truth. \n\nShe \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to live with herself\u201d, but she\u2019s fine with making her partner a widower and single parent, and her baby an orphan.", "NTA Dude how I hate the you don't have a kid so there's absolutely no way you could have a valid opinion on anything kid-related. When I was in high school I dated an older guy who had a daughter. One day he was explaining to me something about the way she pees, and they were taking her to her pediatrician. I don't remember what I said, I just remember him asking if I had a kid he didn't know about. I was confused, and he said you don't have a daughter, so how would you know? I said dude. You're right, I don't have a kid. But I have a fucking vagina, & I think I have a pretty good understanding of it\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Would be NAH if she wasn't being an AH first towards Anne and her partner, she's pretty much saying \"Anne should have died\" which imo is just as crude if not more than what you said given she's your friend. I absolutely get her choice while I don't share it, and can imagine how upsetting it would feel for her to picture the outcome where she lives, but she doesn't get to shit on Anne and her partner for choosing otherwise. It's about as personal as a choice gets, and the survivors suffer either way so it's nobody's business to comment on someone else's choice.", "NTA. You are entitled to your opinion and decision on this matter as much as Laura is entitled to hers. This is a very personal matter, and there is no right or wrong answer. \n\nI think Laura was already sensitive because her husband not agreeing with her. I do sympathize; it must be really upsetting to know the person who'd likely have to call the shots if you were in that situation won't do what you expect them to do. But that's something they have to work out in private, as it's a private matter. \n\nAgain, Laura is entitled to her views but she's an asshole because \n\n1) She's judging Anne and her husband's decisions and talking about a very sensitive and tragic event in their lives behind their backs. She has no right to decide whether what they did is right or wrong (it was right for them, that's all that matters), and no decent person would be gossiping about a couple who had to choose between the life of the mother and the child, that's just horrible. \n\n2) She brought up the topic expecting an ally, and when she didn't find one in you she proceeded to attack you and discredit your opinion \"because you don't have children\". If she wanted support because of being upset about the disagreement with her husband, she should've expressed herself differently. Antagonizing you for disagreeing with her is shitty, and if this is what she did with her husband I wouldn't be surprised that's what went awry with their discussion. \n\nFor the record, I have children and I agree with you, Anne and her husband. I would choose and expect my husband to choose my life over the unborn child's.", "NTA\n\n> Anne's husband was the one to have to make the decision of whether to save the child or to save his wife and he chose Anne (this is of course a very simplified version of events).\n\nThis isn't even how it works.  Doctors save the mother and the baby either makes it or doesn't.  There's no real choosing.  That's TV drama.  \n\nThey may have given him a choice between two options where the mother's chances were a little lower than the other, but they'd still be geared toward saving her unless this was a religious whackjob hospital that needs investigating.", "NTA. She brought it up and was actually being pretty horrible about Anne and Anne's husband. You're allowed to have your own opinion on this too.", "NTA. You did nothing really wrong, though part of me wanted to say No aholes but the friend comes off as slightly judgemental. But then it is an emotional topic that people have strong opinions of", "NTA. The topic came up, you gave your thoughts on what you would do if you were in that situation. Everyone has their own plan in place for child birth, that's one of the things the doctors discuss with you. Before and during my pregnancy if anything happened, my husband told me he'd choose me over the baby if I was incapacitated for any reason.  It was something we both agreed on, as it's part of your birthing plan.", "Info: Who brought it up?\n\nIt sounds to me as if she may have brought it up looking for backup as her partner disagrees with her?\n\nIf this were the case, then IMO telling the truth, if she asked you outright for your opinion, does not make you an ass.\n\nOn the other hand, if you brought it up for some reason, then YAMDTA.", "NTA.

Oh well.", "NAH. This is an extremely difficult topic. I know what choice I would make, I think, but understand why someone may come to the complete opposite conclusion. \n\nHopefully, your friend delivers a happy and healthy baby, and everything goes according to plan.", "NAH I guess. Why even have this conversation?", "NAH, it was just your opinion and your friend just happened to have a different one.

But why upset the pregnant lady with hypotheticals.  I had a very scary emergency delivery. I didn't think we would both make it. I made it very clear my son was to be saved if it came down to it. I laid there scared to death and prayed that as long as my child was okay to take me instead. Thankfully we were both okay.", "YTA.\n\nThis is not something a pregnant woman wants to hear.", "I am going with soft YTA. I don't actually know what my partner would have chosen if it had come down to it, but he knows I would have rather died than have to go through losing my child. Mentally, I don't think it is something I could have survived. I do know if it came to it, I wouldn't have blamed him for the choice. What you are asking your husband to do is lose the woman they love to become a widow whilst raising a child alone. It is very hard. The fact that she's so close to giving birth is what pushes the YTA. It was clearly upsetting her, so the conversation should have moved on.", "Soft YTA, really soft. Purely for entertaining the conversation, not for your opinion. Obviously you know what choice you would make in that position. I would've made the same. But you get a lot of these here, where people go \"my wife asked if I'd save her or the dog in a house fire AITA\" - just don't get into hypotheticals.

Hypothetical \"who do you save\" trolley problem convos always end badly no matter what you say", "[deleted]", "I can\u2019t tell you what the right answer is here as of course it\u2019s a very subjective subject. What I can tell you is when I was heavily pregnant with my first (and currently only) my fianc\u00e9 and I also had this discussion due to my very high risk of preeclampsia. I wanted him to save our son, he wanted to save me and we never agreed. Luckily it wasn\u2019t a problem. However, if this were to be an issue with any future children, I would agree with him, but only because I wouldn\u2019t want my son to grow up without his mum and I know how badly my fianc\u00e9 would struggle to take care of our son and a newborn whilst grieving for me.
