Sometimes this includes delivering the baby earlier than is ideal, but until the baby is delivered, mum is the priority. Once the baby is delivered, it\u2019s an entirely separate team of doctors working on the baby (obstetricians for mum, paediatricians for baby). \n\nThe only exception I can think of is asking a pregnant woman to have a termination to allow for chemotherapy, but that isn\u2019t an emergency decision- it can be talked over for days with various specialists/counsellors etc.", "NTA that's an extremely personal decision. It's okay that Laura has a preference, she knows what choice she would want made and that's okay. What's not okay is for Laura to criticize Anne's husband for choosing differently and claiming that only her choice is the correct choice. She is literally saying that she think's Anne should have died instead, and that's just a sucky thing to say about anyone, let alone morally grandstand. Laura was being cruel with what she was saying even if she never to Anne or her husband her thoughts. \n\nYou're mom is wrong on this, you weren't saying it to be crude, you were being honest to make a point and defend your friend and her husband who went through something terrible", "NTA, besides making a pregnant woman upset, perhaps should have dropped her sooner. \n\nBesides that, your friend has serious issues if she believes an unborn child is more important than a fully grown adult.

I don't remember what I said, I just remember him asking if I had a kid he didn't know about. I was confused, and he said you don't have a daughter, so how would you know? I said dude.

I absolutely get her choice while I don't share it, and can imagine how upsetting it would feel for her to picture the outcome where she lives, but she doesn't get to shit on Anne and her partner for choosing otherwise.

But that's something they have to work out in private, as it's a private matter. \n\nAgain, Laura is entitled to her views but she's an asshole because \n\n1) She's judging Anne and her husband's decisions and talking about a very sensitive and tragic event in their lives behind their backs. She has no right to decide whether what they did is right or wrong (it was right for them, that's all that matters), and no decent person would be gossiping about a couple who had to choose between the life of the mother and the child, that's just horrible. \n\n2) She brought up the topic expecting an ally, and when she didn't find one in you she proceeded to attack you and discredit your opinion \"because you don't have children\". If she wanted support because of being upset about the disagreement with her husband, she should've expressed herself differently. Antagonizing you for disagreeing with her is shitty, and if this is what she did with her husband I wouldn't be surprised that's what went awry with their discussion. \n\nFor the record, I have children and I agree with you, Anne and her husband.

I wanted him to save our son, he wanted to save me and we never agreed. Luckily it wasn\u2019t a problem.
