ELOPE- Then you can have the Ceremony that will mean something to the two of you, which is what it is SUPPOSED to be about. Wear the dress you want! Have a \"Party\" with everyone after, but stop compromising!! WHY is it that \"Christian\" faith says Love and accept people, but only if they do everything the way \"we\" tell them to.  Either your \"Family\" loves you or Religion is more important than having you in their lives. You are NTA if you are choosing your Fiance'", "The Norse pagan thing kinda baffled me, I mean I get losing your faith and all that but the answer was Norse paganism? ( admittedly I don't know what that entitled)\n\nBut at the end of the day is your weeding. Your choice.", " I have already compromised on my wedding dress one song and having my dad walk me down the aisle as when my brother got married he walked my Sil down the aisle taking that moment away from me.  \n\nYou have already compromised by having a non denominational wedding, rather than the Norse ceremony you would probably prefer!  Don't see any compromise happening on their side.  Personally I would hold a hand fasting with all the fun and games I can think of, and nip down to wherever you can have a civic ceremony the day before.  There is no way both of you should consider making promises to a God you don't believe in, to keep your family happy.  If you want, you could do a 'blessing' with their priest at some time, but I wouldn't.", "You are not an asshole but you are in a difficult dilemma. \n\nI can however give you biblical arguments, if you are willing to discuss this with your parents. \n\nI\u2019m a Christian and my mom who is also a Christian got married (third marriage) to my stepfather. They had a non denominal ceremony, because the Bible says that one shouldn\u2019t remarry if divorced. She also felt that it was ridiculous to promise God to \u2018for better or worse\u2019 when she already broke that promise twice. \n\nThere is no biblical argument for a Christian ceremony. Christian ceremonies were invented by the Catholic Church and adopted by the Protestant Church. Marriage is merely a contract between two people. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I want a Christian ceremony for my wedding although I\u2019m a Christian. I feel that the church has corrupted the meaning of the bible to get control over people. \n\nChristian culture has developed for 2000 years and the culture has nothing to do with the faith and the word of the Bible. \n\nI fear that the organized church has pushed so many people away from faith by using unbiblical doctrines. \n\nYou deserve to have your family there and they are AH\u2019s if they won\u2019t attend - it\u2019s not like you are doing a satanic ceremony with child sacrifices etc. \n\nTalk to them about love and how they would hurt you by not being there for you and how it hurts you that they are trying to strong arm you. \n\nBest of luck, what ever you decide.", "Have whatever wedding you want and just point out to your parents that you are having a wedding that is meaningful for you and you would love them to be there.  Ultimately it\u2019s their choice. You can\u2019t make them better than they are and you don\u2019t have to have a wedding you and your fianc\u00e9 don\u2019t want just to try and make your family behave decently \n\nNo idea why your father can\u2019t walk you down the aisle after walking your SIL down the aisle. I have 3 daughters. My husband will walk them all down the aisle if that\u2019s what they want. What am I missing here?", "NTA", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding. If your parents don\u2019t come they will be missing out. You have to do what you feel is best for you & your future husband. You will be living with him not your parents. When you look back you don\u2019t want to look back with regret. God, didn\u2019t abandon your partner, go see a Christian counsellor for the word & guidance. LOVE IS UNCONDITIONAL", "I am so sorry - that's an incredibly thoughtless, arrogant, and unloving stance to take on someone's wedding. If non-denominational isn't a good enough compromise, they don't belong there. I recommend you go ahead as planned without them if your mom isn't bluffing. \n\nWhy are you compromising on your dress and music?\n\nAs for your dad walking your SIL down the aisle, I don't see that as taking a thing from you. That was her moment. If he walks you down the aisle, that's your moment. Those are different moments.

Likely not. \n\n Call their bluff. Don\u2019t give in to their bullshittery. Elope, if that\u2019s ultimately what you and your fianc\u00e9 want. If they want to disown you after you making a choice with your fianc\u00e9, let them. Drop the rope.

This is a power play moment - they either accept what YOU want for your own wedding, or send your regrets that they\u2019re no longer invited and will be missed. \n\nCongratulations on the nuptials! Have the wedding you both want and F the rest who can\u2019t pull their heads out to support you.", "I'm sorry if it sounded demeaning, it was simple curiosity as I wrote I don't know what entitled the Norse Paganism, but if you have found support and acceptance is basically all you can ask for.", "Prince Harry and Meghan + Crown Prince William and Kate did handfasting during their Christian ceremonies. Their grandmother Queen Elisabeth was the head of the English church at the time. I don\u2019t think you need to hide anything, maybe explain it to them upfront.", "Thank you", "No yiu didn't sound demeaning om sorry if I came off that way.
