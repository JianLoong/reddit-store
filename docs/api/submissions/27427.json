However his mom has always been a bit of an issue, a few examples are:\n\nWhen I met his family his mom asked about my past dating life and I didn\u2019t know what to say so I said something along the lines of I\u2019ve seen a few guys I guess. Then she looked at my bf and asked if he really likes a woman that sleeps around. I waited for him to say something but he didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nWhen we see each other she constantly says she\u2019s always gonna be his number one girl. \n\nAt a New Year\u2019s party we kissed and she told me tone it down (didn\u2019t say anything to him)\n\nDoes she see me as some sort of gross threat to her crazy Jocasta complex?? \n\nHe says she\u2019s just\u201dbrutally honest\u201d and has only ever given half assed \u201cmom chill\u201d comments when she insults me but doesn\u2019t do much and when I try to retaliate he tells me shes sensitive and try to just move past it. Anyways last night was my last straw. I passed a very difficult test so my boyfriend wanted to go to a congratulations dinner. \n\nAt his moms house because he hasn\u2019t seen her in a while. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to argue so I said ok, thinking that maybe she won\u2019t be rude. I was wrong obviously. She had made my boyfriends favourite meal and hugged and kissed him nearly on the mouth the second he got in the door. I said hi and she gave a cold hello then told us dinner was ready. As soon as we sat down she talked about how I should watch my portions because I look a little bigger than the last time she saw me (5\u20197 120 pounds). Thankfully his dad told her to cut it out and she just rolled her eyes. My boyfriend said nothing. His dad went on to congratulate me and asked about what class it was for. I told him and my bfs mom just laughed and gave a \u201cwe\u2019re celebrating for that? It\u2019s not a difficult subject.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I snapped because I\u2019ve never been good at math and I was so happy. So I said that I didn\u2019t even want to be here for dinner but my boyfriend insisted. I turned to him and said he\u2019s a mamas boy and needs to realize their relationship is weird. Then I walked out and drove back to my place. \n\nHe messaged me an hour later saying I really hurt his moms feelings and needs some space. I said I\u2019m sure she\u2019d like that and then turned my phone off. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695411001, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pj3jh/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriend_a_mamas_boy/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly it\u2019s not worth the hassle and misery you\u2019re gonna go through. Being tight with your mother is a positive thing in a partner but this is one thing else and he just allows it. This is only the beginning. No exaggeration here just Lee looking for someone else and for the love of everything good never have this man\u2019s children she may harm them and work very hard to mentally jerk them around and cause psychological harm. You\u2019ll never be able to trust her alone with children and the more committed you become the worse she\u2019s gonna get. A jealous mother is an undiagnosed person with severe issues that are beyond destructive. It shows she doesn\u2019t actually have any love for her child whatsoever .. she doesn\u2019t want him to experience love or joy in a relationship. It means she\u2019s most likely a narcissist or sociopath or both. What this means is that his intimate relationship that makes him happy threatens her, makes her jealous and angry and this venom and hate is nothing compared to how far these types will go to ruin your life. Run girl", "NTA. We see plenty of story with this kind of guy-mom relationship and it rarely end well for the wife/gf. Even the good stories go through a lot of headache before the guy figure it out and then is able to create firm boundaries with their mom.", "NTA - I would run away...after ALL of that, the best your boyfriend could say was \"you hurt my mom's feelings\"? Give him space. All the space. Forever space.", "NTA - and I'd give him all the space he needs and then some. Like you should move on to a better relationship amount of space.", "NTA.\n\n\"My boyfriend said nothing.\" - your BF is a pretty weak guy, tho.\n\n\"He says she\u2019s just\u201dbrutally honest\u201d\" - honestly does not have to be brutal, that's a red flag people use to try to justify their cruelty. Your SO needs to learn that because it's an example of unhealthy communication styles. \n\nHe's not likely to change and if you stay together, the chances of their relationship - and his behavior changing - is unlikely. Is that what you want for years to come?", "NTA\n\nBREAK UP WITH HIM.  This dynamic will never change. Do you want this for the rest of your life? Go to justnomil sub and see what all those people have to put up with because they married or procreated with their mama's boys.", "NTA\n\nWish him and his mommy a very happy enmeshment and ride off into the sunset", "Definitely NTA. You got out in the nick of time.", "NTA. You should have done this earlier. Your bf should not be dating; it would be disloyal to his marriage to his mother.\n\nThe odd thing about this is that we usually only see this when his mother's alone. It's very weird for this to happen with a living, co-resident father.", "NTA\n\nHe should be sticking up for you in a big way. And he indeed needs to stick up for himself too. This was supposed to be a celebration for you and it's \"nope, gotta be at my mom's house\".\n\nShe has not right to belittle you whenever she feels like. \n\nAnd after all that, he's going to tell you that *he* needs space because mommy says her feelings were hurt? He's shown you what the future holds.", "Nta....and that's funny. He needs space because you really hurt the feelings of someone who thinks you sleep around????\n\nThank you, next!!!!! Give that BOY all the space him and his mama need.", "NTA. You should have done this sooner. She insults you and he doesn't say or do anything? Get out now. Woman who treat their grown sons like this are so creepy and weird. He's upset you hurt her feelings? What about all the times she has been rude to you?", "NTA. Now finish it up with blocking him and getting away from situation that is never going to get better.", "NTA.   Give him lots of space....break up with him.  Mom will come first", "NTA.  \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\n*Run!*", "NTA. You need to get out. Things will never get better, only more slanted to make his mommy happy.", "NTA It's unlikely he'll change anytime soon, so you should seriously consider ending this relationship.", "Ew that is giving me the ick youre NTA they are weirdos lmao give him all the space he needs! Its been a year and you can do better queen", "It's strange, it even seems like his mother likes him in a romantic sense, and to be honest with you, marrying this guy seems like the biggest mistake you could make, he definitely doesn't see a problem with his mother's actions and it could get worse.", "Yikes!\n\nNTA....it sounds like you're right about it.", "NTA. Your words may have been harsh, but not untrue. She was bullying you, and he was happy to let that continue. Family is supposed to be supportive, not tear you down every chance they get.", "NTA! What a momma's boy... I'm sorry but if he can't stand up for you now, he won't later.", "NTA. Dump him, he's never going to change.", "NTA. Giiiiirl, *run.* This will only get worse! If he were willing to stand up for you, there might be some hope, but he has made it clear that he will ALWAYS let his mother walk all over him AND YOU. Is that what you want for your entire future?", "NTA let him marry his mom like he wants", "NTA but he\u2019s obviously not picking his you over his mom so cut your losses and move on. There isn\u2019t a dick in this world worth that stress.", "NTA. Watch \"I love a mama's boy\", you'll be able to relate!", "NTA. His mom is crossing boundaries and he is not stepping up for you. If you want to get married it\u2019s not a good look. If he doesn\u2019t start standing up for you now he never will. Though hopefully you can make him aware and give him the chance.", "NTA at all. Break up with him and give it to him straight, it's over because his relationship with his mum is creepy, to speak to his dad about it because he recognised she was out of line as well. That her putting you down at every opportunity is insane and her doing stuff like kissing him almost on the mouth is super creepy.\n\nThat if he ever wants a relationship with a woman who doesn't end up hating him and his mum he needs to cut the umbilical cord because apparently it's still connected. He should speak to his friends as well and even friends mothers and give them some honest examples and see what their take is on his mothers behaviour.\n\nIf you stay then you're just confirming that his relationship is okay because you stayed, if you leave and tell him why he might actually realise the relationship is a genuine issue. Like you don't owe him this, it's just a nice thing to do to give him a shot at a decent relationship in the future.", "It's better than telling him he has a little d!@#", "Ah yes, the emotional incest of a mom and her son.\n\nI'm so tired of seeing mom's like this and I'm even more tired of these grown ass men letting their mother insult their partners. Then seeing them get mad at them for either defending themselves or becoming upset for pointing out their lack of a spine. \n\nNta leave his ass, he had a chance to realize that his mom is crappy and instead he blamed you. \n\nBreak up with him he won't choose you.\n\nHe needs to see how his relationships fail because of him and his mother's relationship.", "That's gonna leave a mark in yalls relationship.", "NTA. I\u2019m a grade A mother\u2019s boy, but my mom has her own life and your boyfriend\u2019s mom desperately needs to get one.", "Wow, definitely NTA. Break up with him immediately. A mama\u2019s boy relationship never ends well, especially when they don\u2019t even stick up for you when their mom is picking on you. His mom is being extremely obvious that she doesn\u2019t see you as a potential family member, and this doesn\u2019t bode well in the future. In case you need a scenario:\n\nIf you and your boyfriend get married, his mom will be in your life very often, using your child as an excuse to see him. His mom will control your marriage, and nit pick on you and your boyfriend will do nothing about it. This will either end with you being bitter for the rest of your life, or you divorcing him and wasting those precious years. \n\nThere\u2019s a huge difference between guys who respect their parents, and those who let their parents do whatever they want.", "NTA. He must be blowing your back out for you to continue to deal with the disrespect from his mom.", "NTA \n\nIf he won\u2019t correct his mom or set boundaries with her now, it\u2019ll never happen.", "NTA\n\nYeah, completely reasonable for you to lash out, but honestly I think you're a bit off on the target. The dude's relationship with his mother isn't the issue, and attacking that isn't going to get you anywhere. \n\nThe issue is that (a) his mother seems to be under the impression that she can belittle you with impunity, and (b) that he doesn't seem perceive that mistreatment as a problem.\n\nAs to the mom's feelings, it depends on why she feels hurt. If she feels hurt because you belittled her relationship with her son, that's actually kind of reasonable. \n\nHowever, if she were hurt because she got called on her shit and didn't like it, that would be unreasonable on her part. The problem is, based upon how you described you snapping, it doesn't sound like you did that. \n\nSo you might actually want to apologize for the misfire, but also to use that as an opportunity to raise the issues that we're actually bothering you.  Also, maybe do this with the dad in the room, given that he told her to cut it out, he might serve as a useful bullshit filter int he moment.", "[removed]", "YTA", "YTA  \n\n\nWhat is he supposed to say? In all honesty, maybe try standing up for yourself. The worst thing he can do is ruin his relationship with his mother for a girl he really is not sure he wants to spend the rest of his life with.
