My mum and dad decided it was too \u2018unique\u2019 to give me as a first name and that instead they would move the tradition to it being the middle name. Sometimes traditions are there to be broken and or adapted. Not saying you have to give it her as a middle name, I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s perfectly fine to not give it her as a name. Your husband is, thankfully, on your side too and as it\u2019s the parents who have final decision on a babies name, your decision is made.", "As you said, this is your daughter. You name her the name you chose. I was pressured to name my son after my grandfather but I didn\u2019t. The world did not end. My family got over it.", "Your husband is awesome, many would cave to their family even if it means asking their wife to hurt. In a small thing, like letting granny make the apple pie instead you taking your award winning pie, this is ok, but naming a child is for the parents to do.  Family does not have to like it. Besides, what if YOUR family had a 12 generation name to use, what then?  You are the mother, you will use this name every day. You and your husband are on the same page, stay united.", "NTA.\nI am seeing alot of this on Reddit.\n\nIt is your baby, you and your husband decide what the name will be, NO one else.  The grandparents dot Not have a say.  \nScrew tradition.", "Nta. Your baby, your rules. It's that simple.

Naming your much beloved daughter the name you, her parents, have lovingly and excitedly chosen for her.  His parents and grandparents need to knock it WAY off with this guilt trip business.

Teenagers suck.\n\nIn the interest of not repeating the weirdest name-based bullying I ever saw... do not name your child something that teenagers will turn into a name like Anal Sex Butt Sucker. Just because nobody said it in front of teachers didn't mean that it wasn't all over.\n\nFirm nope on that name from me. I never called her that and she had enough confidence and such to not let those people outwardly get to her, at least. She handled their shit really well. Remarkably so. She shouldn't have had to, though.\n\nAll I associate that name with was the stupidest bullying ever because Annalise was nice enough and kind of cute and smart. She totally didn't deserve that.

It was in the 1000's or something when I was born. I've met... two other women with my name my whole life. It's a traditional but not a common name, nor is it a WTF name. It's easy to pronounce and spell. I really like that I got a name that is just for me. I don't run into other people with my name, but my name is still a name and not a r/Tragedieh.\n\nI wouldn't want to be 'generic placeholder girl child name'. Everyone gets that name? No. I want to be me. There's nothing special or cool about being first girl getting the same name as five other first girls. It's not even being named after so and so because they were great, or sharing something with a parent. Getting a default name would suck. You aren't you. You're First Girl. \n\nNah.\n\nPick a good name for your future adult person who will have opinions over how you named them.

While the big problem is extended family trying to force a name, it's further made an issue with OP's past.
