Fran told our entire group of friends that they, she and her daughter, would receive hair donations to make a wig for the kid. \n\nI was going through a breakup, and I wasn't emotionally ready to let my hair go. For context, I have very very long black hair and I take very good care of it. \n\nOne day, at the end of our workday, Fran told us that we had to go home with her because she had scheduled a stylist to cut all of our hair for the donation. She never asked if we agreed to his request, and I never told her I would, but everyone happily accepted and went along. \n\nI took her away from the group for a moment to explain that I couldn't donate my hair, but if there was another way to support them, even with money, I was more than happy to do it. But Fran did not accept and demanded that I go, because her daughter loved my hair and thought it would be a nice gesture on my part to give it to her. \n\nI refused and she insulted me, so I left. \n\nIn the following weeks, I began to receive mistreatment from our group of friends and other coworkers, telling me that I had no empathy for a little girl who was going through the worst moment of her life. I received threats, they wished me dead, they wished I would get cancer and that no one would help me. I even received threats that they would put gum or cut my hair, so I wore it up for weeks until my boss noticed it and asked me what was happening. My boss scolded everyone and I haven't received any more comments, but the environment has been very hostile since then. \n\nI'm starting to think about whether I was selfish and could have donated even a part of my hair.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1700778620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182cq54/aita_for_not_donating_my_hair_to_a_girl_with/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or even if making several wigs - how many people in your office have hair that\u2019s long enough to make a wig from?", "NTA at all. The amount of entitlement here is at holy shit levels. No one should ever just assume that people are going to donate to any cause of any kind. It\u2019s fine to ask, but never okay to strongarm or bully, which is exactly what they\u2019re doing to you. You are NOT an AH for not wanting to part with your hair. Hair takes forever to regrow and means a lot to people and their self image. \n\nYou clearly showed you cared about Fran\u2019s daughter by offering to help in any other way, even money. She\u2019s just pissed you didn\u2019t give her your hair which she clearly had been planning on ahead of time when she said her daughter loved your hair. \n\nDon\u2019t allow them to bully you and if anything else happens I\u2019d report them to HR or whatever you have. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re straight up making threats against you. These people are scum. This is not okay.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds more like Fran is bullying you because she's jealous of your long hair than anything else.", "NTA, so much NTA.\n\nYou are under no obligation to cut off your hair for anyone. If you were getting it cut anyway and wanted to donate that would be lovely. However you want to keep your hair and that's the end of it. It sounds like they had more than enough hair for a wig without yours.\n\nIt was lovely of you to offer to help in some other way.   \nDon't doubt yourself over this, it's not your responsibility and your co-workers are being entitled assholes.", "NTA someone just demanding they cut your hair. Your co-workers bad as well. It took you years to grow your hair. To demand and yes that is what Fran was doing is maximum AH behavior and your co-workers are just as bad.", "NTA. Charities like WigsforChildren and LittlePrincessTrust (essentially hair donation charities) do amazing work in trying to give children a slice of normality.\n\nThe main word we can focus on is **charity**.\n\nNobody should ever be tricked, forced, coerced or guilt-tripped into taking part in charity because it completely removes the **voluntary** aspect of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour *friends* are assholes.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve done all the right things, You offered a more than reasonable alternative and now it seems to me like she\u2019s become the bully\u2026.You don\u2019t want to cut your hair that should of been the end of it, She can\u2019t just demand you cut your hair.\n\nAlso if you work with people so immature they\u2019re going to wish death on you purely for not cutting your hair then you need a new job! These people are equally disgusting and need to take a long hard look at themselves and you need a new friendship group", "NTA.\n\nExpecting other people to automatically give up a significant portion of their hair, even in circumstances like this, is insanely entitled. I could excuse it for the mother, she is probably not thinking straight. But the rest of your colleagues are assholes for criticizing and mistreating you. You probably shouldn't have told the boss, but that's only a small part in the whole matter.", ">She never asked if we agreed to his request, and I never told her I would  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>explain that I couldn't donate my hair, but if there was another way to support them, even with money, I was more than happy to do it.

If you don't want to do it then don't. No need to give a reason \nSecondly she shouldn't have booked this and demanded everyone to just do it, it should have been a choice people could make. And she should have given more warning. \nGo home, enjoy your hair. It's sad a child has cancer and is loosing her hair, but you shouldn't be pressured into cutting yours off", "Go to HR over this. NTA", "NTA and you should have gone to Management and HR the moment she demanded you go to her house to cut your hair against your will. Not to mention the death threats and other harassment.", "NTA and sorry but donating money is far more helpful than clumps of hair for a person going through cancer treatment, so the fact that they scoff at that is ridiculous. Honestly they\u2019re probably just trying to sabotage you because you have great hair.", "NTA. This reminds me back when I was in middle school and a 'friend' gave me a handmade birthday card with a picture of my long hair and some scissors. She put $5 in the card and wrote \"please use this to cut your hair.\"  \n\nFor context my hair was down to the center of my back. It was  healthy, I got current trims to maintain the health of my hair.  And was always complimented on it. \n\nSome people take jealousy way too far. Especially when it comes to other people's hair", "You are NTA but all these other people are definitely in the wrong.  There is no way you were obliged to participate and their childish manipulative bullying behaviour is beyond entitled.", "NTA why are they so entitled to your hair? Your body your choice, don't let them pressure you", " Nta", "Sorry, where do you live that this is a thing?\n\nIn North America to be able to donate your hair it has to be a certain length, it cannot be dyed or treated, etc. \n\nI just find it hard to believe that a group of random women from an office would all have hair appropriate for wigs.", "NTA. What the hell did I just read?! I feel sorry for the girl, I have a little girl myself, but demanding people should their hair for her is beyond ridiculous!", "Erm, no, NTA. She isn\u2019t entitled to your hair. You don\u2019t owe her your hair just because she has cancer. The fact she thought she could just tell you to get your hair chopped off for her daughter and you would agree is delusional.", "I'd report the death threats to the police. Let them realize how much they are the a holes", "NTA, but this makes no sense. You can\u2019t just grab a bunch of hair and walk into a wig maker\u2019s.", "NTA.\n\nCutting off someone's hair (what they are threatening to do) is illegal, although I don't know how much that differs depending on where you are.  My point is, it's gone beyond bullying into threatening criminal behaviour, and you should at minimum talk to your HR department (or some other employee assistance org if you don't have one).", "NTA. \n\nSounds like you work with a bunch of AHs though.

Weird.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone a single cell from your body. It\u2019s yours and it\u2019s not selfish to say no to an appearance-altering act as drastic as cutting your hair off.

Maybe if OP has really long beautiful hair, the mother had already eyed her hair up as the specific wig hair, and got all the other workers to say they\u2019d cut theirs too, just so OP would do it. They go to the house and OP goes first, suddenly \u201coh that\u2019s actually enough for the whole wig, thanks everyone, no need to cut yours now\u201d. \n\nBecause otherwise this makes zero sense.
