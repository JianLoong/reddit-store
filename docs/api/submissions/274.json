My mom told him I needed his sign and approval to leave the country and find better opportunities to study and learn languages, at first I thought he didn't care about that and he would give us the approval so I could get my documents, but he started with that stuff like \"I really miss my daughter, I hope one of these days she can forgive me.\"\n\nThat pissed me off, I don't want to be related to that man in any way, I'm hurt and I don't think I deserve that kind of treatment. I always dreamed to have the best family, because I always dreamed of having a father like my uncle with my cousins, no matter how late he got home from work, he has always some time for his children, he never misses an opportunity to enjoy his sons.\n\nIn order to have my documents, he has to be present throughout the process and I don't feel ready to see his face without bursting into tears and claim his indifference during all these years.\n\nSome of my relatives told me I'm being immature and childish, that I should give it a new chance, but simply after almost 13 years I am not going to give it a second chance, because he doesn't deserves to be I'm my life after all this year's he didn't wanted to be in.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667238586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yij60u/aita_for_refusing_to_see_my_father_after_13_years/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Something your biological sperm donor never did. (I refuse to say father, because he doesn't deserve it.)\n\nIf I sound cold, I apologize, but you need to use that man to get what you need. Bury that hurt and anger and turn it into purpose. Tell him you'd be happy to meet with him once the paperwork has been filed. Your so preoccupied, it would make zero sense to meet until the red tape was taken care of so you can have a conversation focused on other aspects of your lives. Purpose for a better life. Smile, stay vague, and manifest your dreams.", "NTA your life, your decision. He made his decision 13 years ago. Now you made yours. And a very grown up one at that. Good luck to you!", "NTA, but what I would suggest is doing whatever you need to do to get those signatures from him and get away. Let your relatives know that sure, in another 13 years you\u2019ll consider contacting him. I love people that haven\u2019t been harmed stepping forward to tell you to get over it \ud83d\ude44Who cares what they think? Also tell him you\u2019ll take him more seriously when he pays back all the money he shorted you on.", "It\u2019s very easy for your relatives to pass judgment and tell you you\u2019re immature considering they were not the ones that were cast aside and hurt. Maybe you could thank them for keeping their irrelevant opinions to themselves? NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell that AH to call you again in another 13 years.", "NTA. Your dad can play the pity card but you know his deal. He's only back in your life because his is falling apart. But you do need him to sign the papers and that should be your goal. There's alot of hurt that you're holding on to, is there a counselor at your school you can talk to?", "I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from, but for your sake and not his, forgiveness is important. You don\u2019t know his intentions, good or bad, until you talk to him with an open mind.", "NTA - But need this man to sign these documents.  Be civil and hear him out, get him to sign these documents and then figure out from there if you want a relationship with him.  \n\nIf he balks at signing them bc then \u2018you would just leave\u2019 respond with \u2018yes I would bc I want to study abroad, but you not signing them doesn\u2019t mean we will have a relationship either.  So either support me in my future goals or don\u2019t. Not signing just shows me you are the person I\u2019ve always thought you were.\u201d", "NTA.  OP, Do or say whatever you have to do or say to get to follow your dreams. Cry yourself out in private so you can show a tearless face tomhim. Your mother may be falling for sweet talking lies but that man didn\u2019t bother to even see you in 13 years.  I guess your mother actually is gonna \u201csee\u201d him even though he\u2019s not divorced yet.", "NTA\n\nBut meet him so that you can get the signed documents that you need - then do what you want after that.  There's no sense in hurting your own future, just to maintain your ire against your father.  Get what you need from him first.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to see him if you don\u2019t want to. That is 100% your choice (unless like you said you want to go abroad before you\u2019re an adult and you need his express permission). \n\nHowever, you\u2019ll never know how he really feels about you unless you talk to him, and it sounds like there are some questions you\u2019d like answered. Also, you\u2019re still young. On the off chance that he does really want to finally step up and be there for you, there are still 50+ years of time you could enjoy with your dad.", "NAH. You don\u2019t have to see him but you don\u2019t know the full story. You only know your moms side.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Make nice just long enough to get the papers signed, promise anything at all about the future and then never speak to him again if that's what you want.  And the family members can take a freaking hike with their unwanted opinions.  Enjoy your travel!!!"]}
