We became close our second year and moved into an apartment together. On school breaks she stayed with my family and when she has stayed at our house for months at a time and got close with my parents. \nShe is very booksmart but not street/ financially savvy at all. She got into a prestigious school for masters and naively expected a full scholarship. They gave her half and she has to get a 40k loan for the rest not accounting for living expenses. As an international student with bad credit her interest rate is about 16-20% more than it would be an American co-sign. So she got the bright idea to asked my parent to cosign her student loan. AND THEY SAID YES. \nI\u2019m appalled on many fronts. \n1. We are not rich by any means. And I know they don\u2019t have the funds to pay if the she defaults. \n2. I have only known her 3 years I find it disrespectful of her to ask this huge favor of my parents without my knowledge \n3. She has talked casually to me about going back home or doing her doctorate in Europe so she is definitely a flight risk\n4. I don\u2019t think she understands the full weight of the loans she\u2019s taking on and how financially devastating that is. \n5. I took loans in my own name because I didn\u2019t want to burden my parents more than necessary\n6. My parents are on the older side Im afraid they may have been manipulated into saying yes. \n7. She has other family members in the states who she didn\u2019t bother to ask first. \n\nHelp. I want to convince them to say no before they sign anything. But they live by a very Christian \u201cwhat would Jesus do\u201d code and they take it very literally. We don\u2019t have much but we have a home and a small business at stake and I don\u2019t personally trust her enough to make this risk. On the other hand, they are adults who can handle their own finances would it be patronizing for me to question the sanity of this decision?", "created_utc": 1683276493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138fkw6/wibta_for_asking_my_dad_to_not_cosign_my_friends/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are times when you have to protect your parents and this is it. My sister and I have had to step in to help one of our parents because they are too kind. They want to help because that's what a good religious person would do. It's so na\u00efve. You say your friend isn't street smart, give her credit. She is VERY smart. She got into a prestigious school for her Masters and is getting half her scholarship paid. They don't give this type of opportunity to everyone. The girl knows what she's doing. That's why she asked your parents instead of asking you to ask your parents. Sorry, OP. This is a bridge that I'd burn.", "NTA. Your friend is not your friend at all. She should have never approached your parents without asking you first, and it was very manipulative of her to do so. I think you need to speak to your parents about the fact that she has family in America that she could and should have asked first. Something about this feels so deceptive and calculating. I would do whatever you need to do to get your parents to rescind their offer. I would also end the friendship if she follows through with this.", "YWNBTA \n\nDo it right now, change their mind on this. Don't make them sign. Your parents must think she's a good person but from your description it seems like she's a fraud. \nPlus, if your parents are on the older side, imagine how impactful her leaving her debt to them could mean.\n\nEdit: the fact that she asked them without talking to you first imo is a big red flag. She knew you wouldn't be ok with it because you know how she really is, while they do not.", "It seems like a violation to me. She is taking advantage of my parents kindness and crossing a boundary of our friendship. She wouldn\u2019t ask me for that even though she knows I have good credit because she\u2019s aware of that boundary between us, so why ask my parents behind my back?", "NTA.  You need to clearly explain to your parents that they will be responsible for this loan if she doesn\u2019t pay.  She can go back to her home country and the bank will come after your parents. There are numerous stories on the legaladvice subreddit from people who cosigned loans and now had lawsuits filed against them because the main borrower quit paying. Your parents would be very foolish to do this and I completely understand your concerns.\n\nEdit:  Have them watch that miniseries on Netflix about Anna Delvy. Maybe that will show them that pretty young girls can be frauds too.", "NTA - good on you for identifying those risks. I\u2019ve worked in risk management admins mitigation and those are 100% huge indicators of a flight risk and also contribute to her high % rate. Your parents should absolutely not co-sign and you\u2019re an amazing daughter for protecting them and identifying those risks.", "NTA. Bad credit means she's unlikely to pay it back, and that means the debt would fall to your parents. They should not sign that loan. You friend should consider working for a few years to save up for her master's degree if she doesn't qualify for the loan herself.", "NTA\n\nAt best your parents are naive and don't fully understand the situation.", "NTA. My parents have drilled into me that I should never cosign a loan for anyone (except perhaps my kids if I ever have any). Not for my best friend, not for family members, not for anyone at all. The risk is too great as even honest people can fail to repay their loan.", "NTA to explain to them your concerns. They sound valid! This \u201cfriend\u201d sounds like a master manipulator. But you do need to be prepared for your parents to do it anyway. I understand you\u2019re concerned they\u2019re being manipulated; but this conversation could hurt their feelings (or their pride) if you aren\u2019t careful. I don\u2019t know how close you are with them. If they think their religious beliefs compel them to help this person, you may want to have someone from their church help you explain things.

You aren't entitled to her asking your permission to talk to them about anything. She's known them for a while now and trusts them, likely they see each other as family in a way.\n\nThat's just my two cents; don't be angry that she \"went behind your back\", just be focused on making sure your parents fully understand what they agreed to sign up for, financial liability and all.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds so incredibly fishy. Your dad agreed to something no dad would ever do for their child\u2019s friend of 3 years.  Unless\u2026.\n\nThis person either is fucking your dad or has blackmail material on him or has possibly something on you and blackmailing your dad with it.
