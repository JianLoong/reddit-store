My brother moved back in with my parents after college, and go to school and live about 30 minutes from there house. My little sister moved 8 hours away for college this year and really misses our family dog. Our family dog is named Bella and she is 15 years old now, and isn\u2019t doing well. I went to my parents for dinner yesterday and was shocked to see how poorly she was doing. She is covered in tumors and can barely walk due to being in so much pain. Her having cancer isn\u2019t new, and she is missing her back paw after it was removed due to a tumor. She also only has a few teeth left and her mouth is full of abscess, so she can barely eat. But the worst part is what happened when I was petting her last night. I accidentally grazed one of her bumps and she snapped at m and bit my hand. THIS IS NOT WHY IM SUGGESTING WE NEED TO PUT HER DOWN. I don\u2019t care that she bit me at all, except for the fact it showed how much pain she was in. Bella has never snapped at anyone in our family and it just shows how terrible her condition is. I suggested to my parents that we take her to the vet and see if they can do anything to help. They said no because they knew the vet would suggest we put her down and we could not do that until my sister comes home for break in 3 weeks. I ignored them and took her to the vet anyway to see if they could give her some pain meds and fix her teeth so she is more comfortable. When I went to the vet today they said there was nothing they could do and described her condition as being even worse than i thought. Not only does she have viable tumors her insides are also filled with tumors and she is spending her time in agony. The vet said she probably has less than a month and all the things we could do to keep her comfortable are to expensive for my family to afford. When Bella and i got home my parents and brother were pissed. They said I was selfish for suggesting we put her down before my sister says good bye. But I don\u2019t want her to suffer for the next 3 weeks, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667617265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymie7z/aita_for_suggesting_my_family_put_down_our_sick/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When a dog is in that state, the most humane thing to do is to euthanize her. She has no quality of life and waiting for your sister to come back home in 3 weeks is a terrible excuse.", "NTA. If your dog is in that much pain, it would be much kinder to put her down sooner rather than later. There\u2019s no quality of life for her right now and nothing anyone can do to improve it, from what you\u2019ve said.", "NTA. Its cruel to make her suffer even one more day. Your parents are making Bella's last days a living hell.", "Can you call your sister and explain to her what the deal is? She surely wouldn't want her dog to suffer.", "NTA\n\nCan you FT or FB or Skype video for your sister to say good bye?\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to let an animal suffer like this.", "This is animal abuse. The vet should not have let you leave without scheduling a euthanasia appointment - that's totally unethical on their part and they should have protected their patient. Please, please let your pups suffering end whilst she still has some dignity. Three weeks is too long to wait. This is a huge responsibility as a pet owner, but you already feel that her quality of life is no longer there. I hope Bella gets her peaceful sleep \ud83c\udf08", "You are most certainly NTA. Expecting an animal to suffer in order to fit the family's schedule is cruel. Bella doesn't know why she hurts so bad. Dragging this suffering out is absurd, and you're decent for having the dog's interests, though they may not be long for this world, at heart.", "NTA. Keeping an animal in agony for our own selfish reasons is never okay. The poor baby deserves better.", "YOU ARE NTA.\n\nGood God, how can your family see her like that every day and do *nothing????* \n\nCall your sister and let her say goodbye to Bella over the phone. If she loves her as much as you say, she would be aghast to see her in such agony. And please allow Bella to escape her failing, painful body.", "NTA.  Too many people don't put themselves in their pets \"shoes.\"  Terminal illnesses that cause vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, confusion, pain, etc. are serious reasons to have your pet euthanized (between what the owner sees and the vet's opinion).  Anyone that makes their pet suffer needlessly is purely selfish.", "NTA and I\u2019m kind of surprised your parents haven\u2019t been reported for animal cruelty. They should absolutely be putting the dog down and if it\u2019s so important that your sister see her, she needs to come visit from college. Or he\u2019ll, even FaceTime or something.\n\nDoes your sister even know about any of this or how bad the dog is? If she loves the dog so much she shouldn\u2019t want her to suffer, and may not even want to see her in such awful shape.", "NTA but your parents are. Call your sister.", "Nta.  My moms toy poodle was 16 when she put him down.  He had uncontrolled diabetes.  She waited a day so my sister could say goodbye.  He whined and cried all night until the vet opened the next day.  She said she 100% regretted it and would not do it again.", "NTA", "NTA Your family are putting their needs before the dogs. I can't imagine keeping a dog in agonizing pain for such selfish reasons. Have your sister face time the dog after you explain what the vet told you. Give this poor animal mercy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And let her know you could facetime her before or while doing the euthanasia.  Most vets are wonderful when you have to euthanize, my dog a few months back had to be put down and i wasn't able to be there but my husband did face time me while there and it helped a lot, also you can do the dog prints in clay and a little snip of fur for your sister and if you decide to cremate you can get a small urn for her as well.", "NTA. She\u2019s past her breaking point. Euthanasia is not cruel, leaving a dog to suffer is.", "If I did that she would probably rush back home to see her cause I know she wouldn\u2019t want her in pain.

NTA, tell your sister, and help pupper pass as peacefully as possible asap. \nI think the rest of your family are making lame excuses because THEY are not ready", "Op tell her it's the weekend she can get back to school by Monday.  If Bella is this bad she might give up and pass on her own soon. Before your sister can make it home.", "Ask yourself how bad you feel that Bella has suffered even this long without help because your parents didn't want to add to YOUR stress. Would your sister want you to let Bella suffer too \"protect\" her? Let your answers to those questions be your guide.\n\nStory: I almost didn't see my grandmother before she passed because my mother didn't want to make me drive 6 hours to see her then potentially do the trip again for a funeral, so didn't tell me how bad she was. My brother called me and filled me in, for which I am eternally grateful. I did spend over 24 hours driving in one week (with two young children) and have never been so tired, so my mother was \"right\", but I wouldn't change it for the world."]}
