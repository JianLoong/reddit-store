Both our parents were happily married for decades. Mine for 51 years, his for 45 years. I have 2 brothers and a SIL but no other family members (my grandparents are long gone and both my parents are only children). My husband has 1 sister and a close aunt and uncle. \n\nMy husband and I have been married for 12 years and the holidays have always been a bit of a struggle because his family lives 2.5 hours away and mine live 1 hour away, but in the opposite direction. Before losing our dads, we\u2019ve always spent the actual holidays with my family then spent the day after with his family. The reason for this is because the holidays and birthdays are a HUGE deal for my family (probably because we are such a small, tight knit family), and his family has always been ambivalent with any type of holiday/birthday celebration. Even our wedding day was no big deal with them (I hold absolutely no ill will about this, I accept and love them for who they are). \n\nThis year my MIL wants us to celebrate one of the holidays with her and her family, but if I do that, I would be leaving my mom, who is still very much grieving my dad\u2019s passing, with just my one brother on Thanksgiving and just her, my 2 brothers, and SIL for Christmas. I would feel horribly bad for doing that as she is so emotional on the holidays. I, as the only woman in the family, see and notice her emotions more than my brothers do and I help her cook, clean up dishes, etc. I have been her emotional crutch since my dad passed and she relies heavily on me, which I don\u2019t mind because I too am still very emotional about losing him. \n\nWhen my husband asked about spending one of the holidays with his family, I suggested we spend the day with our respective families. He didn\u2019t seem bothered by this but he\u2019s kind of a closed book emotionally, so I can\u2019t really tell what he\u2019s thinking. We only discussed it once, but it will eventually come up again. \n\nSo, WIBTAH for spending the holidays with my family and my husband spending the holidays with his family?", "created_utc": 1697813657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cd60s/wibtah_i_dont_want_to_split_holidays_with_my/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While I understand the situation and in a vacuum, that wouldn't be an issue for one year, but the problem is that you guys usually see your family for holidays and then tack on a visit to his on the end. He may feel as though you dont value his family as much...and I know you say they are indifferent to holidays and major events, but how far have you investigated that? Also, this arrangement might now be bothering your husband. He may be a closed book emotionally and this could be his first step to changing things up a little. I mean, he wants y'all to finally see his family on a holiday...that being said, I feel like youre the AH for immediately turning that down. This more than likely solidifies his feelings that his family will always come last", "YTA.

It's not a fresh recent event where your mom especially needs support. You've been going to your place first this whole time. It seems like your husband does mind but isn't saying anything. Have an actual conversation with your husband to see how he feels. Then go to his place first (regardless of what he says). Even if its been almost as long since he lost his dad, he and his family need support too. His was also more recent than yours. You and your family are not the only ones important.", "Why don't you host at your house and have them visit you?", "YTA. \n\nIF we go by your \u201cjustification\u201d of your mother being emotional because she\u2019s still grieving her husband (I\u2019m not doubting your mother\u2019s grief, I simply believe that\u2019s a BS excuse you\u2019re hiding behind) then his mother would take priority because the death of his father is more recent, therefore she\u2019s more raw than your mother. \n\nOnto the real reason, you can justify it all you want but you have been getting YOUR way with YOUR family for 12 years and your ILs have been understanding and didn\u2019t want to cause drama.

Just because their level of celebration is not the same as your family's, it does not negate it.\n\nIt is the right thing to do.  You have forced 12+ years of your husband to miss his family on the actual holiday, you can do ONE holiday a year.  Sheesh.", "YTA. Its time to let your husband have a holiday turn.", "Yta.  It\u2019s been 3 years.  It\u2019s not fresh anymore.  It\u2019s not unreasonable for his family to ask to have a holiday.  My mother has passed as have both of my husbands parents.  When they were alive, we alternated holidays to be fair.", "It seems not to have dawned on anyone that you can have combined holidays with both families invited?", "First, my condolences to you and your husband for your losses. My FIL died 11 years ago and it can still be very fresh and painful for my wife and her family. It gets easier, but it doesn't go away, so ignore the folks telling you \"it's been 3 years get over it.\"\n\nThat said, YWBTA. You say his family has never really celebrated holidays because his parents were nurses. So it's worked well for you this far.  Now, MIL would like to experience spending one of the days with the family. After 12 years, I think it's reasonable to change how you've always done things and grant her this. In many relationships, this is already how it's done. \n\nYour feelings about \"leaving\" your mom are understandable and valid, but your brothers can pick up the slack. It sounds like at least one of them has this kind of arrangement already (splitting holidays), so they'll understand. \n\nAnd if it's just too much to do this year, consider an idea like this: go to his family for Thanksgiving, but spend Wednesday night there (or closer). Have Thanksgiving at lunch, relax, then head home. If you absolutely need to be with your mom, you may be able to make it to her for dinner.", "INFO: Have you really sat down with your husband and talked this out, similar to how you've laid things out here?  Or, if not similar, at least tried to lay out all of the factors and stuff?\n\nObviously, you know your husband and your relationship better than anyone here.  At the same time, it can be easy for couples to fall into patterns/habits over time, and it can take an outside prompt to re-examine those habits with a new eye.  It can also become easy for couples to take a certain status quo for granted, and you might need an outside prompt to re-examine your assumptions.\n\nSo, you describe your husband as \"closed book emotionally\" and you can't really tell what he's thinking.  For most people, the obvious answer to that is: well, you're going to have to TALK to him in order to get at what he's really thinking.\n\nI have to point out, too, that it's kind of notable here that you're saying that HE brought up spending one of the holidays with his family.  Now, going by what you've said, this whole thing of \"we spend the actual holiday with my family, because they care more about holidays, and then go to spend the next day or whatever with his family\" is a very long-standing tradition/pattern/habit for you two.  So, doesn't it TELL YOU something that he actually brought up spending a holiday with his family?  He is just as aware of this long-standing pattern, and the reasons for it (his family doesn't care as much about the actual holiday day).  So if he is suggesting something that breaks that pattern, that should really be a \"!!!!!\" moment for you.  He's doing something different and out of the ordinary.  There must be an underlying reason for it.\n\nBut, instead, it sounds like you suggested splitting up for the holidays.  And, I mean, yeah, that is one possible solution to this question.  But I want you to rewind a bit, and take a look again at WHY he suddenly asked, after 15 years, to spend a holiday with his family.  What's going on with that?  Why did he suggest it?  What is he thinking about it?  What is he FEELING about it?\n\nIf he's a closed book to you and you can't tell, the only solution there is to talk about it.  \n\nThat feels to me like the crux of this issue.  You have feelings about your family and your loss, and the hole it has left in your family.  He does too.  But you seen to be just reflexively assuming that the long-standing status quo (in which his family doesn't care that much about being together on a holiday) is still the case.  But you don't seem to truly KNOW if that's true, or not.\n\nWhat you need to do is sit down with your husband, and explain where you're coming from, but just as strongly, you want to know where HE is coming from on this.  What prompted him to suggest this major variation in a routine you all have followed for years?  Even... why is he suggesting it this year, rather than right after he lost his father?  (What is different for his family this year, that didn't lead him to want to change the routine when his father's loss was more immediate?)\n\nYou also need to figure out how to have this conversation in a way where you are sincerely open to possible changes to the routine you've followed up until now.  And in a way where you're sincerely open to hearing how he feels.\n\nI know how hard it can be to have this kind of conversation with someone who is more emotionally closed off.  But sometimes, you have to at least try.  And you can start by \\*saying\\* that you can't tell what he's thinking, or feeling, and that's why you need him to try to articulate it.  But you also have to be aware of creating an atmosphere in which he does feel welcome, and able, to express what he's thinking -- even if he might need to say something that appears critical of the way you've been doing things for years, or appears frustrated with him always having to defer to how you want to do things.\n\nI also know that some people might say, \"well, he's an adult, he can choose to speak up if something is that important to him\", and that it's not your job to hold his hand through it.  In a case like this, though, I personally don't agree with that viewpoint.  Couples get into habits, and it becomes difficult to address when one person is feeling dissatisfied with what you've been doing for years.  It's even more difficult when one person is more emotionally expressive, and the other person becomes anxious about saying something that will upset them.  Or, there may have been a point in the past where he tried to open up about something, and you didn't quite notice, but it made him feel rebuffed and like he \"couldn't\" start a conversation like that with you. \n\nI'm not saying any of that in order to make it seem like you're the bad guy or anything.  I think this is probably more of a NAH here situation than anything else.  You and your husband clearly have some different styles of communication and self-expression.  You love each other, but as I keep saying -- it's super easy for people in a long-standing relationship to fall into patterns that are \"easy\", and not recognize it when a situation arises where you need to actively question those patterns.  And if one of YOUR patterns has kind of been just assuming \"he's more emotionally closed off and he and his family aren't as invested in this particular thing as me and my family are\", then yeah, you may have missed some undercurrents.\n\nThis is your cue to look into this more deeply.  It does sound a bit like you've been unaware of some of the depths of your husband's grief and his family's grief, because they're not as expressive as you and your family are.  But there must be something that has led him to suggest changing things now.\n\nAnd something else that has come out in others' comments, and your replies: you've said that joint holidays aren't something you've considered because your families haven't been close up to this point.  But that's another long-standing habit, isn't it?  People change.  Situations change.  The way you've been doing something for the past 15 years doesn't mean it is the way you must continue to do it until the end of time.  Just because there's been a status quo for 15 years doesn't mean you can't look up some day and say, hey, you know what, let's try something different.  Your respective families not having socialized at all for 15 years doesn't mean the book is closed and they can't ever get to know each other better NOW.\n\nGood luck with all of this!  You're both going through things that can be difficult to negotiate, and you need to give each other even more grace than you normally would.  But, you should both also be open to the idea of changing things up to meet the new challenges that life is throwing at you, and at your respective families.", "NAH. Why not compromise and invite them all to spend the holidays with you and your husband at your home? It doesn't have to be one or the other. Both family groups are small enough that you could easily combine them. Why is your first inclination to have you and your husband have separate holidays? Is there some animosity between your two families? I don't understand why you and husband would spend the time apart. Your MIL's request is perfectly reasonable and there is no real reason you can't put husband's family first for once. Your mother would survive one holiday without you.\n\nIf you can't invite all of them to yours, I think for once you should not prioritize your mother and put your MIL first. It's slightly selfish to always say that you must go to your mother's when there are compromises to make.", "Talk to your husband and get his feelings.

You think your husband and his mom should be celebrating with each other on different days to accommodate you?  Totally Yta", "I am not going to rate you\u2026 I am a widow, so I have been in your mother\u2019s shoes and but I am further along than your mother or MIL (10 years).\n\nAt 3 years, it is time, actually past time for your mother to find a new normal for herself.  She is a widow, after 3 years she is emotional and grieving.  She is stuck.  She isn\u2019t processing her grief, she is reliving it.  When you lose a spouse, it is much different than losing a parent.  When you lose a spouse, you go from being half of a couple to a single person.  That leaves a wound on your soul that has to heal.  It heals through the grieving process and the process of building your new chapter as a widow moving towards becoming a single person.\n\nAs a widow, she has much more freedom than she used to have.  She has freedom to redefine what she does for holidays or her life.  With this new freedom comes fear, fear of the unknown, fear of making decisions on your own with no one to back you up,  because you always made decisions with your husband or your husband made the decision.  Now it\u2019s all on you.  If your mother never lived on her own before she got married, she is even more fearful because she has no experience at living alone, paying her bills, etc.\n\nYou need to read the book widow to widow, it\u2019s written by a marriage counselor who lost her husband and realized that grief counselors don\u2019t understand the grieving process for widows.  Your mom and your MIL should read the book.\n\nYour Mom is trying to hang on to the traditions of the past as a way to hang on to her husband.  She isn\u2019t processing that she has her memories of Christmas past and recreating the same Christmas every year can be more emotional and more sad than reinventing a new way to do Christmas to fit the new circumstances.  This also goes along with right sizing her living situation.  And getting involved in new social groups, activities, volunteering, etc to build her new life as an empty nester widow.\n\nYou and your husband separating for the holidays is not a good strategy for the both of you.  It\u2019s not a strategy or template for next year or the year after.  It\u2019s time that you and your husband strategize on what Christmas could look like, its also time for you to have a discussion with your mom on letting go of some traditions and maybe adopting some new ones.  You also need to think about what you want.  You may want to talk to your siblings, and your husband may want to talk to his siblings.  It may be time to make Christmas floating where the moms are going to their adult sons and daughters houses for the holidays.  That she gets to be queen and enjoy being waited on for the holiday rather than rushing around her kitchen.\n\nI hosted the holiday dinners for a few years after my husband past just as we did before.  My teenage son would help.  But then I started to get frustrated because it was a lot of work on me, and my son went off to college, and I started thinking about snowbirding.  But I thought I couldn\u2019t just give up hosting until a friend of mine said, why are you doing all the work when there are others in the family perfectly capable of hosting.  You are the widow, this is your time to enjoy being the attendee and chatting about events and stuff without having to worry about putting out the meal.  I thought about it and I was like good idea.  Once I stopped hosting, it was like a snowball rolling down a hill\u2026 I started to embrace being an attendee, and bringing my dish, but not worrying about hosting.  It freed up time for me to do other things like volunteering at the homeless shelter, new things that I never tried before because I was busy being married and raising kids.  That helped me process my grief so that I am left with all of the memories but none of the emotional reliving which is very much like ptsd where you are reliving the experience as if you are really there rather than recalling it a fond memory.\n\nFYI - I ended up selling my house because it was a great house to raise kids in, but not a great place for an empty nester widow\u2026 I rightsized to a condo in a resort area\u2026 I love it, and my son and I visit family when I can.  It works for me.  I look forward rather than looking into the past.", "WNBTA if it really is okay with him and works for you and your husband. I am in a similar situation (mom's husband died and the adult children had to pull together to keep mom company on holidays) and knew it meant a lot to my mom to have my sister and her children, the grandkids, for Christmas. But then she would be all alone on New Years Eve/Day so my husband and I always went to his parents for Christmas and my mom for New Year's Eve and Day. It kept my mom from being so lonely then and we made it work- we made a big deal of cooking a nice meal on NY Day. On NYE, I made all sorts of snacks and dessert type foods for us to enjoy while we played games, watched movies and watched the ball fall. It became a cherished tradition which we all looked forward to! My mom is dead now and we still miss her desperately on NYE and NY day! What did we do on Thanksgiving? We invited both sets of parents to our house for a feast which we all prepared together. That freed our siblings up to go to their in-laws without problems or conflicts, something which they appreciated greatly.", "Thank you.", "YTA.  Maybe he is also feeling neglected.  Your dad died a year before his.  It sounds like your mom is totally dependent on you. It sounds like she needs grief therapy.  It sounds like it has all been about you, your mom and the loss of your father, putting your husband, his mother, and their loss of his father on the back burner.\n\nIf he is kinda closed off maybe he has checked out of the situation because he doesn\u2019t believe what he wants will matter.", "Thank you. I haven\u2019t officially turned anything down. As for the reasons his family is indifferent to holidays, that\u2019s because both his parents were nurses and always worked holidays so they never celebrated holidays on the actual day.

OP sounds central to both families. OP should offer to host everyone.", "Thank you.", "He\u2019s never cared about holidays (he\u2019s specifically said that) so it hasn\u2019t been an issue until this year.

I appreciate it.", "I\u2019m a bit surprised too, but like I said, nothing is set in stone so I don\u2019t mind. My husband and I did have a brief conversation about it, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind spending the holidays separately. He\u2019s not one to hold back either. I will call my MIL and see what she thinks. Great idea that never really crossed my mind.

It puts purpose to my grief and I promised my dad that I would take care of my mom. She will never be alone.

Thank you for your reply.", "NO,  the holiday issue has been there for years, this time you want Reddit to tell you that your selfish behavior is acceptable. It is not, you have made it clear for years his family will never matter. His family's loss doesn't matter. You have broken him to the point he doesn't honestly share his feelings with you. You have repeatedly shown him you  don't care.  You are beyond an asshole, you are abusing your husband by alienating him from his family.

Because you don't seem to when you suggest splitting up for holidays after having years of spending holidays with your family exclusively.", "Just not enough for him to get to spend a single Christmas day with his father in the 10 years before he died, huh?", "Tantrum is a figure of speech. When your immediate response to him wanting this is \u201cyou go with your family and I go with mine\u201d that\u2019s not a difference of opinion.
