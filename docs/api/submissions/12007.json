I just sent an message to the sorority group chat, explaining how they're expected to behave on the ship, and now I'm being inundated with nasty replies and emojis. The message is self-explanatory, so I'm just gonna post it here.\n\n\\----\n\nHey, ladies! It's your favorite sorority president here, reporting live from our spring break cruise! As we all know, this is supposed to be a fun and relaxing vacation, but apparently some of you can't seem to handle a little bit of freedom without causing chaos and drama.\n\nFirst and foremost, to the girl who brought her boyfriend on the trip without getting prior approval from the executive board, you are the definition of selfish and inconsiderate. Do you think you're the only one who wanted to bring a significant other? Newsflash: we have rules for a reason. It's not like we just arbitrarily decided to ban boyfriends from the trip for no reason at all. Your complete disregard for the rules and the feelings of your fellow sisters is beyond frustrating.\n\nSecondly, to the girls who keep disappearing and not checking in with the group, what the hell? We are on a cruise ship, not a deserted island. We have a schedule and activities planned, and it's not fair to the rest of us who actually want to participate and have a good time if you're off doing your own thing all the time. If you can't handle the responsibility of being a part of a group, maybe you shouldn't have joined a sorority in the first place.\n\nAnd let's talk about drinking. I get it, we're on spring break and we're supposed to let loose and have some fun. But there's a difference between having a good time and being a complete mess. To the girls who can't seem to control themselves and end up puking all over the place or causing a scene, do us all a favor and stay in your cabin until you can act like a responsible adult. It's embarrassing and disrespectful to the rest of us.\n\nFinally, to the girls who keep complaining about every little thing and can't seem to appreciate the fact that we're on a freaking cruise ship in the middle of the ocean, please get a grip. This is supposed to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and you're wasting it by being negative and nitpicking every little detail. If you're not enjoying yourself, maybe you should have stayed home instead of bringing everyone else down.\n\nIn conclusion, I am beyond disappointed in some of you and your behavior on this trip. We are supposed to be a sisterhood, and that means respecting each other and following the rules. If you can't do that, maybe it's time to reconsider your place in this organization\n\n\\-----\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for repremanding my sisters with this message on our cruise?

Because this message was written in a rather grating tone, it comes off as condescending and rude.  Calling someone the definition of selfish in a group chat instead of wording it in an objective manner is not an effective way to address the problem.

You should have spoken directly to those that were breaking the rules, not sending out a passive aggressive email calling people out without using their names but making it clear those involved who you are talking about.\n\nPeople should have been aware of the rules beforehand, was that not provided? A much better way you could have handled this would have been sending a general email to everyone just reiterating the rules and if anyone had any questions they could come to you. Then you should have connected with the people privately who are breaking the rules and speak to them in person as opposed to sending an email. The way you handled it just embarrasses others and yourself.\n\nAlso, isn't the whole point of spring break while in college to let loose and have fun? Obviously you want everyone to be safe and respectful/responsible, but this isnt the way to get anyone to listen to you.", "ESH\n\nI was in a sorority.

You can't force people on a big cruise to stay all together the time, and you certainly can't stop them from complaining.\n\nIf you'd focused on just the excessive drinking, and treated it seriously, (less is more with this kind of thing) and picked a few girls to monitor the others and escort wasted girls back to their rooms, that might have been effective.
