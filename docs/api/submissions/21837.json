I spent the past 3 months looking for a new job while keeping working tirelessly for my current job. \n\nA couple of months ago, it was announced that the entire company would be invited to a 2-day trip abroad to celebrate their 10th anniversary. All flights and hotels were booked and paid for.\n\n2 weeks ago I was offered a job and took it, and immediately resigned from my current job with a 1-month notice. The company trip was happening this week, so still within my notice.\n\nI got a message from the CEO telling me I could no longer join the company trip the day after I resigned. \u201cFair enough\u201d I thought. It\u2019s a little petty considering everything was booked and paid for, but I get it.\n\nNow on Monday, the CEO comes to me and asks that I work on material for the trip - namely a quiz and some slides. I thought that was a little cheeky of her considering she\u2019s uninvited me but, whatever. It just reinforces the feeling that I was leaving for the right reasons. They keep changing the presentation and it\u2019s just more and more work for me. I end up working late on Tuesday to get all out the door in time for them to print and pack for the trip.\n\nOn Wednesday they keep sending changes that I spend time applying despite having some work that I was getting late for. At the end of the day (about 12 hours before their flight) I send all the material. \n\n7PM, I just got home and I\u2019m about to start making dinner when I get a message from the CEO on my private phone number asking that I make more changes to the deck.\n\nNow, I\u2019m really getting pissed off. \nFirst - you\u2019ve asked me to work on some material for a trip you uninivited me to.\nSecond - you keep changing your mind about everything and I keep my cool.\nThird - you make me miss other priorities because \u201csome images are not exactly what I have in mind\u201d\nFourth - I\u2019ve already spent three days on it and worked late to get it ready in time.\n\nI just ignore the message.\n\nMy manager calls me requesting that I stop what I am doing (dinner, after work hours) and get back to the presentation.\nI told her I found their attitude incredibly disrespectful and that I was only going to have a look at it in the morning - in any case they\u2019ll be on the flight so it won\u2019t make a difference.\n\nAITA for sticking to my limits?\n\nJust for info, while they were having cocktails in Lisbon, they had me work both days on bids and tenders while being literally the only person in the company working on those two days.", "created_utc": 1688995873, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vu5ht/aita_for_refusing_to_work_after_hours_on_material/", "score": 381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
