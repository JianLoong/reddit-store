This will be our 6th Thanksgiving together. I have cooked the last 3 dinners myself. My family lives overseas so the holidays are usually spent with his family. \n\nThis year, his grandmother who lives in a neighboring state invited him over for Thanksgiving. He initially said yes but he got his work schedule late and realized he was working Wednesday and Friday night, so he wouldn\u2019t have time to drive there and back. So he told me we\u2019d be having Thanksgiving here again. I confirmed with him multiple times that we were making dinner here before I went and bought all the ingredients because I only had $200 in my account and Thanksgiving ingredients are expensive as hell. \n\nWell, this morning he told me that he found someone to cover his shift on Wednesday so he\u2019d be leaving to his Grandmas\u2019s this morning and will be coming back Thursday night so there won\u2019t be a need to make the dinner this year. I was half asleep when I responded \u201cthen why would you have me buy everything\u201d. He started flipping out telling me that I\u2019m a miserable person who wants him to be miserable with me, that I ruin every single holiday, that its not his fault my family doesn\u2019t spend the holidays with me, etc. \n\nA couple hours later, he told me he was sorry and that he\u2019d be coming back early on Thursday so we can make dinner (or rather I make it for him when he arrives lol). I told him no thanks and that I don\u2019t really want to spend the holidays with him, y\u2019know since he says I ruin them and all. I\u2019m also perfectly happy eating a box of stuffing alone for Thanksgiving while watching a movie so I don\u2019t really see the need to make the dinner tbh. I don\u2019t even know if I want to still be with him so why bother? He\u2019s now saying that I\u2019m being an AH and petty. My friends are saying that I should just go ahead and make the dinner since its the holidays, and that it is pretty petty to not make it since I brought up the fact I bought everything when he told me he was leaving.

It sounds like you're just done with the relationship and this thanksgiving debacle is one more hiccup.

Hmmm\u2026.", "NTA. Doing thanksgiving alone is a lot, doing it for a whole ass family that isn\u2019t yours is a big thing to take on. It\u2019s a dinner, that\u2019s it. Also if he and his family eat the food they or he can chip in for the cost. If you don\u2019t want to deal with all the food, donate it to a food kitchen or someone in the community in need\n\nI did thanksgiving last year for my now husband and I and I hated it. Don\u2019t like touching raw poultry, I was cooking all day and things got dried out when I tried to warm them up again, I cried twice because I was overwhelmed. Swore up and down I\u2019m not doing a traditional thanksgiving for just us ever again. And I am not doing it this year, I said what I said lol. This year I plan on making a bunch of thanksgiving side dishes. \n\nHow you wish to recognize a made up holiday where people pretend that colonizers and native Americans had a nice happy dinner together is up to you. But don\u2019t bust your ass for someone you don\u2019t really want to be with", "NTA girl run", "Obligatory dump him. I mean if someone said I ruin everything by being there it'd be the point of no return for me.\n\nNTA, and think long and hard about whether this relationship is worth it.\n\nI mean you spent the last remaining chunk of money in your account to make the holidays good for him, and he did not care. or worse, he was ready to leave you and said you ruin everything for him. So uh...\n\nWhy would you wanna stay with a person like that??", "Or they could split it.", "I think the issue is OP's friends are not good giving advice.", "I only have Thursday and Friday off and he needs to be back by Thursday so it makes more sense for him to drive out today alone (when he has the day off) than for us to go out for one day only. Also, if you\u2019ve ever driven on the 91E on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, you\u2019d also avoid it at all costs lol.", "Of course. He should be helping too. This sounds quite one-sided.", "Yeah it does.  I\u2019d at least have him do sides.", "NTA. Break up with him, he's not nice at all. Enjoy your movie and stuffing. While it's cooking you can look for a place to move to.", "He's taking you for granted and has no respect for you.\nNTA", ">I don\u2019t even know if I want to still be with him so why bother?\n\nSounds like you have made up your mind. Once that thought enters you head its almost impossible to relent. \n\nSo you could make him one last meal before giving him the boot. Or make the meal, Send him a photo of you eating said meal. Followed by a text saying how 'miserable' you are after eating all that food. \n\nOr have a FriendsGiving!!\n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s not petty. What he did was shitty, and there\u2019s so many wrong things in your post I don\u2019t know where to start. Dump him, he\u2019s an AH.", "NTA. \n\nHe asked you to make dinner cause he couldn't attend.

You would rather spend this holiday alone. He thinks you are a miserable person. Are you really miserable or just with your boyfriend?

Rethink this relationship.", " NTA\nYou're his back up plan. There is no thought in his head about how his actions affect you.

What are you even doing with him?", "If a boyfriend ever talked to me liked that, he would be called ex-boyfriend, and my husband will not talk to me like that.   \n\nYou 2 are partners, you should be cooking and planning Thanksgiving together.

And what is this sh*t about only him being invited? After 5 years of being together? Yeah, I believe new in-laws are also in your future...", "NTA.\n\nHe's doesn't want a GF... He wants a mom to take care of him.  It seems it's the to get rid of the free loader.", "You're NTA. Dies he have ANY good characteristics? He's going to his grandma's for Thanksgiving, leaving you alone?!?!\n\nWhy are you with him?", "Why in the name of all that is sacred are you with someone who treats you this way?
