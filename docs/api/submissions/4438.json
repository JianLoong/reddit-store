I'm sure they would be happier if they didn't have to see your dad's terrible family at the wedding. You know his wife and her children are going to find a way to ruin it for your mom, brother and you somehow. Sucks you're allowing that. So much for trying to avoid drama. You just sent it a wedding invitation. None of you deserve that. Your fiance doesn't deserve that either. Fuck your dad's feelings. His wife and her kids can fuck right off a cliff. I hope you have a wonderful wedding though. Congratulations!! \n\nInvite your dad's wife and her children to lunch. They'll be terrible people, you can blow it up, and uninvite them.

There\u2019s no drama for you if you completely cut them off. The fact that your father will have to deal with it is not your problem.
