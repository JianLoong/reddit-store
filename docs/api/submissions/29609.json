Unfortunately her birth did not come without drama, which is the subject of my post today.\n\nMy husband and I were already parents to our wonderful son (M3), and when I went into labour, my husband and I had agreed with his parents (M65 and F63) that they would take our boy. My MIL and FIL have a very close relationship with our son, so he was thrilled at the idea of a sleepover with the two of them.\n\nUnfortunately, on his way home from their house, my husband was in a car accident. We were all very lucky that it was not worse, but my labour was progressing rapidly and I needed to go to the hospital. Ultimately it was decided that my best option was for my mom (F57) to take me to the hospital and my husband to meet us there when he could. Obviously the birth was a priority for him, and I do not for one second believe that he was dawdling at the accident or trying to take his sweet time.\n\nMy labour progressed much faster than with my first, and my husband was not yet at the hospital. While he was my designated support person, I made the decision to have my mom in the room with me when my daughter was born with the hope that my husband would arrive in time. Unfortunately, this did not happen.\n\nGiven that my mom became my support person, she was given a copy of my birth plan which included my husband cutting the umbilical cord. This was something he did with our first, and he would have liked to do again. However, given that it was now my mom with me, I really didn't want her to have that role. I can't tell you a specific reason why not, it just felt too intimate and like it was her baby. When it came time, I asked that the doctor please cut the cord, despite my mom offering. To be honest, she was all ready to do it by the time I asked the doctor that he do it, and my mom was quite taken aback. In the moment, she asked me why and said I had written in the birth plan that my support person do it and she was now my support person. I told her no, and it had been cut before she could get any further with her argument.\n\nThankfully our baby was born without any issues, and my husband was able to arrive in time to hold her. To be honest, I also didn't want my mom to hold her before my husband, so I did not let go of her until my husband walked into the room. I just wanted him to have all of those experiences, not my mom.\n\nNow, we have had a little while to adjust having our newest little one, but my mom won't let this go. She always moans that she was excluded from a more involved role despite being there for me when my husband couldn't, and she will never have a chance to make those memories again. She is upset about the fact that I have \"double standards\" for her and my husband, and says that this experience will throw a spanner in her building a meaningful relationship with her grandchild.

It's kinda weird she thinks it should be different. He didn't miss the birth by choice and her help on something like this shouldn't be conditional. Her whole purpose in being there should've been because you are her baby, not to somehow compete with your husband and his 'standing' in your life. Sounds like you knew in your gut to make that choice because I doubt she'd ever quit rubbing it in your husband's face that she'd cut the cord or held the baby before him if you'd allowed that to happen. She should be happy she got to be there, see the baby born, but instead she's getting salty about not getting more from what had to be an extremely stressful situation for you? If this interferes with her building a meaningful relationship with her grandchild, it will be because she chooses that path.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's your turn to make these decisions for yourself. She doesn't need to like it, just respect it.\n\nAs for it interfering with her ability to bond with her grandchild....did it interfear with her bonding with your 3yo? That's just an absurd attempt at a guilt trip, and quite childish IMO.", "NTA\n\nalso, wtf? \"double standards for her and my husband\"?. of course there are. one's husband and one's mother are not the same thing, so of course they don't get treated the same in all things. i mean, if mum feels hurt that she wasn't allowed to cut the cord since she was there, then ok. she can feel hurt about it. we're all entitled to what we feel. we are not, however, entitled to pushing that feeling onto someone else.", "NTA. The birth plan was written assuming your husband would be there. It was nice of your mom to support, but that doesnt mean she gets his rights of cutting cords and holding baby.

It wasn't her place at all. She's making the birth of her own grandchild about her. A good parent would be thrilled that their child has such a close bond with their spouse.", "NTA, your mother is being weird.

What an insane thing for your mom to be hung up on.\n\n\u201cMom, I hear that this has upset you, but if you can\u2019t let go of decisions I made after birthing a human being with my husband just having been in a car accident we\u2019re going to have a bigger problem.

I feel like if I drove you to the hospital I could have been your support person...  She just happened to be your only option at the time,  plus you were worried about your husband. Nobody but the person giving birth gets to decide about those intimate details so it's perfectly fine you didn't want your mum to cut the cord or hold that baby. You need to be firm with your mother: she wasn't your choice for a birthing partner,  she was just there. It doesn't make her anymore entitled than she was sitting at home waiting for news and if she doesn't stop going on about it you will pull the plug on any \"meaningful relationship\" with her grandchildren and stop her visiting altogether. And as for double standards... Your husband is a choice,  she's just there. He will always come before her.", "NTA.  The only way that this will harm your mother\u2019s bonding with the new baby is if she turns it into a problem that big.  Grandma needs to have a Frozen moment and Let It Go.", "Nta. \n\nPlease do tell her the next time she mentions her relationship with her new grandchild, \"the only one causing issues is you\". \n\nAnd feel free to point out the oddness of projecting her emotions onto an infant, that you now know to not rely on her for help in an emergency situation and you will choose better next time. \n\nWhat an entitled brat. \n\nEnjoy your new addition!", "NTA. This was something intimate that was reserved for your husband. Is mom also offended at not being a part of the conception?", ">She... says that this experience will throw a spanner in her building a meaningful relationship with her grandchild.\n\nPoint out to her that if this causes a problem with her relationship with her grandchild, that is a choice ***she*** is making, because the baby will not know or care.

Your birth plan was to have your HUSBAND cut the cord. You did GREAT not letting your mom do that. He had to miss the birth of your daughter due to an emergency. It wasn\u2019t like he was at home watching a football game. Your husband was already disappointed enough and having to listen to your mom after she cut the cord would have probably crushed him! Way to stick up for the father of your child and set boundaries with your mom.", "NTA. OF COURSE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR YOUR MOM AND YOUR HUSBAND!!!!!!!! You\u2019re supposed to!!!

It's *your baby*, you are giving birth and your partner has been in a freaking car accident, it is 0% OK to guilt you for this!\n\nIt would be fine if she just felt sad, since she didn't know you weren't OK with it until the time came and she was psyched up.

For whatever reason, you didn\u2019t feel comfortable with her doing it and you were on the vulnerable situation.

She needs to get over it.", "NTA but I think your mom isn't a huge asshole, but YOU definitely are not.\n\nI think (and I'm saying this as someone who hasn't had a kid yet) in her shoes, I'd definitely be disappointed. She's probably never been on the other side of a birth like that, and it would be a cool experience to have as a mother. She's allowed to feel hurt, disappointed, upset, whatever. I get it. \n\nBut what she IS the asshole for is making her feelings your problem. I don't give a damn what your reasoning is. She has zero rights to any part of your laboring, your birth, or your child. She wouldn't have even been in there had there not been an emergency situation. You could have told her from the day you announced your pregnancy she was gonna cut the cord and then decided in the moment that you didn't want that and you'd still be NTA. Your body, your choice.\n\nShe is absolutely allowed to feel her feelings and her hurts and disappointment, and I'd say since it seems yall have a close relationship it might be kind of you to acknowledge that with her at some point to help her work through her feelings, but even that isn't a requirement for my verdict.", "Ehs this post was exhausting", "Nta\nHowever, why not your mother instead of the doctor? Based on your post, this was a very important thing that needed to happen by your husband yet in a pinch you insisted on a doctor who isn't family.\n\nYour mom was important enough to be in the room but not to cut the cord?

Do you and your mom have issues?", "[deleted]", "As someone who had an emergency c-section then two difficult births, my husband could never cut the cord. He didn't care. All he cared about was that I was all right. That is all that matters. Why was it such a big deal to you?

I don't know who held my kid first, her or my husband. I don't care. \n\nOh, yes, you had a birth plan. Like any birth goes to plan. Going against the grain YTA. You denied your mom holding her grandchild for the first time. She needed to bond as well.", "I mean, your mom is probably one of the only people in the world that truly loves you unconditionally. I don\u2019t blame her for being hurt that you didn\u2019t want to share that with her when you yourself came out of her body. There\u2019s nothing more intimate than that. She was there for you and it could be said she would have had way more empathy at that point than your hubby. It was almost unkind that you preferred a stranger do it than your own mom. That aside you are entitled to do whatever you choose. You obviously have your own reasons.

The obly thing that will impact her relationship with the baby is her attitude.", "NTA honey. Look, birth is a very deep and guttural thing. That moment in the birth is about supporting YOU. It isn't who gets to lay eyes on baby, stroke the cord or nibble the toes. This is you in your deepest, strongest and most vulnerable moment. You are literally RAW. This is a moment for you and the person you choose. And to have your one and only partner ripped out from your support in such a frightening way.... You make a plan and yes that is your birth plan, not your birth constitution. Nothing is written in stone. Unfortunately your mother is choosing to make this about herself. Your best bet here is to thank her for stepping in to support you in your most vulnerable moment. You love and appreciate her more than you can say, and you are so very grateful that she understands that a woman in that moment with her husband out of reach, emotions are high and weird. (She doesn't, but here's hoping she'll remember her own birth story) You are aware feelings get wrapped up in the excitement, but everything happened the way it needed to, and you are glad she could be with you when he couldn't. And then it would be wise to get her to share or remember her story. Please keep in mind, she may choose to take this personally, but you did nothing wrong. Once you thank her for stepping in and gently remind her your boundaries are still your own, she's going to make her own choices. Those choices are hers. You have to let that go, and cuddle that sweet little baby until she realizes she's missing baby cuddles too. She may come around, she may not. But hopefully a gentle reminder that the birth moment is about MOM will help. It's not the baby, the dad or the grandma. This is your moment, and you were an amazing warrior! I mean, depending how these comments go, maybe you can show her the post. \n\nGood luck, and enjoy your happy baby cuddles. \n\n*side note* best way to raise siblings, is to remind the 3yo \"this is YOUR baby\" and then the little one \"this is YOUR big brother\".

It\u2019s very wise. \n\n_________\n\nFor the feelings of doubt and guilt you are experiencing: \nGuilt can be a helpful feeling when you\u2019ve wronged someone, because it helps you hopefully make better choices in the future and grow to be a better person. However there are times when guilt is what my therapist called \u201cinappropriate guilt\u201d, and that\u2019s when you feel guilty over things you don\u2019t need to, don\u2019t deserve to, or shouldn\u2019t ever feel guilty for. Oftentimes we feel this inappropriate guilt when others get upset over or strongly disagree with our choices/boundaries, especially if they also guilt trip us about it.\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with inappropriate guilt many times in my life before. My therapist recommended me to go through these questions and phrases when I\u2019m wondering if my guilt is \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d guilt:\n\n* Why are you feeling guilty?\n* Did you actually do something wrong or cause real harm to the other person? (And no, them being inconvenienced or upset that they didn\u2019t get their way is NOT harm!)\n* Or did you do something innocuous (not harmful) that the other person just doesn\u2019t want you to do?\n* Does the other person have an ulterior motive for making you feel guilty?\n* Is the other person a reasonable, trustworthy person? Or do they have a history of manipulation, mooching, selfishness, guilt tripping, and/or cruel behavior?\n\nIf you did do wrong then apologize and make things right with the person you wronged/harmed.\n\nHowever if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and they\u2019re guilt tripping you then reminding yourself of these phrases might help:\n\n* You\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions or how they choose to react to your decisions. If your actions aren\u2019t harming anyone, yet someone else chooses to be upset over it anyways, then that\u2019s their choice to make- let them be upset!\n* You are not responsible for other people\u2019s (or their children\u2019s) mental, emotional, financial, or physical well-being. It\u2019s on them to take care of themselves and their dependents, not you.\n* It\u2019s ok to disagree with other people over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok for other people to be upset over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d to something that harms or inconveniences you, or even if you just plain don\u2019t want to do it.\n* Just because someone is upset it doesn\u2019t automatically mean you did anything wrong. Sometimes people get upset just because they\u2019re not getting their way.\n* It\u2019s not your job to fix the situation or their emotions. Their emotions are their responsibility to manage.\n* Being a good person does not equal being a doormat! You can be a kind, generous person and set healthy boundaries, refuse to tolerate disrespect towards you/your loved ones, and not allow others to take advantage of you.\n* You matter too! Prioritizing your mental, emotional, financial, and physical well-being is important.\n* Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. If helping them hurts you, then say no!", "NTA.

Mother of God, I saw some shit neighbors never should.\nWhen Aziza was born, I was about to wake up her hubs to cut the cord, and she said 'no Suzihanna, you're her babushka now. You, please.'\nSo I did. And so my nabirasi came into the world looking like the most beautiful lizard the world has ever seen.", "NTA. Your mom is being a bit (or very) immature here. I would certainly hope that you do have \"double standards\" for her and your husband! She's your mom, and the baby's grandmother. He's your intimate partner and the father. \n\nIf she has a meaningful relationship with your 3 year old, she will either have one with this child, or if not - it will be her fault for nurturing some kind of imagined exclusion. I would ask her if she really will not feel as close to this child, and indicate that if that's the case, certain steps will have to be taken to ensure that there is no favoritism or \"double standards\" between the two, or contact might have to be reduced. I'm a bit evil, but I'm sure she'll soon default to loving grandmother and put her perceived grievances aside.", "A soft ah. Your mom came through when you needed her help, she stayed with you while you gave birth- which I would consider an intimate moment- but cutting the cord is off limits?", "NTA. Your kid.\n\nYou do need to realize that cutting the grandbaby cord isn't her supplanting you. That's an insecure statement. She feels hurt now bc how else was she supposed to take it? The action says, in and of it's self, \"I don't trust you to do it, but a stranger can.\" \n\nJust bc it's your choice, don't expect there to be no hurt feelings about it. She's only human.", "NTA.\n\nShe has got to be kidding.  Of course you have a double standard!  He's your life partner and the father of your children!  Not wanting her to touch the baby before your husband could get there because you felt it was his right was completely valid.  She's full of baloney that it's going to affect her ability to bond with the baby.  \n\nI'm sorry she's doing this to you.", "NTA. You are a grown woman. She still has the memories of being present for the birth, she wouldn't of had that if your husband was there. She needs to be grateful for what she got. And if she things cutting some tissue is going to prevent her from having a relationship with your son, there are bigger problems. Do not let her bully you with this.", "NTA the fact that your mother thinks she deserves the same role in the birth as your husband the father of the baby is wild entitlement.\n\nYour mothers focus should have been on making you her child feel safe in such a stressful situation.\n\nThe fact that she\u2019s saying oh boo hoo how will I bond with baby when presumably she didn\u2019t do those tasks and bonded with your oldest is absurd. \n\nPut your mother on the back burner until you\u2019re healed up and focus on your baby and toddler.", "Nta. Those were intimate plans for your partner. She was there as a backup, not the primary player. You were uncomfortable with it, end of discussion. I sense that this isn't the first time she's made something all about her and taken the joy away from you. Keep her at a distance if she's going to continue to be a narcissist.", "NTA\n\nShe was meant to be your backup support person ensuring your needs were met.\n\nIf your husband wasn't in the accident she would not have been there.\n\nShe got to witness the birth of the grandchild an opportunity she wasn't going to originally have.\n\nYour original plan was to have your husband there not working about him after an accident.\n\nSometimes things don't go to plan", "Is she actually saying this incident (if you can call it that \ud83d\ude44) will damage her relationship with the grandchild? You're NTA for not having her do it, but if she's willing to let that affect her relationship negatively, it's entirely on her selfish ass. NTA, but your mom needs to grow up and  learn she's not special or entitled to everything.", "NTA. My sister had to be my support person for our second baby, since my husband was away at bootcamp. She cut the cord, and I am eternally grateful she was there for me, but it did make me feel some type of way to see her do it and not my husband. Not resentful, but it just made me a bit sad.", "NTA. While I understand your mother\u2019s disappointment, this pregnancy and birth (congrats!) is yours and your husband (sorry for my horrible grammar!).  I actually applaud your good boundaries and your commitment to include your husband as much as possible - especially after he was delayed through no fault of his own!  Your Mom had the privilege of being there and it\u2019s not really okay for her to expect more or to bring it up after the fact. You are definitely NTA.", "NTA. What is wrong with entitled people thinking shit is about them and moaning that they were deprived of an imagined \u201cright\u201d. Jesus Christ I can\u2019t with people man.", "NTA. Your mom was given a wonderful opportunity to be there with you for your child's birth. Cutting the cord is intensely intimate. You made the right decision there.", "Oh boy mom was so right about the baby remembering every detail of the cord cutting. The OB cut mine. He wore tortoise shell glasses and had blue eyes. He sneezed right after he put the scissors back on the tray.....of course babies remember no such thing. Your mom is either chasing drama or coocoo for cocopuffs.", "NTAH \nWell past time to set some very firm boundaries with your mom.\nTell her you are tired of her beating a dead horse and if she wants to remain close she should absolutely quit bringing it up or she will become unwelcome and miss all kinds of memories with you and your immediate family.", "The fact that she started drama with you minutes after your baby was a true asshole move.\nShe was only there because of bad luck. Her focus should have been you,  her child not trying to create memories for herself. Instead she was just thinking of herself. If you had let her cut the cord you would have never heard the end of it. Can\u2019t you hear it? At every opportunity she will talk about your labor and delivery and how she was there. How she cut the cord. How she held her before her dad. Nothing but me me me! \nShe sounds petty and immature with this double standard bullshit. Your husband is the father of your children of course he should hold his child first.\nTell you mom that you don\u2019t want to hear her whine about bonding or double standards and if she persists you will be taking a long break from her.", "NTA. Sounds like she needs to cut the cord from you.", "NTA. Your mom believes she's on equal ground when it comes to your husband? You need to tell her exactly why you did not let her cut the cord or hold lo before husband. Exactly what you wrote above. She is delusional.", "NTA\n\nHaving a baby is a trying time. I get wanting to have your husband have as many of the firsts as possible. If your husband had been there to cut the cord, does she still think her relationship with her granddaughter would be compromised? \n\nI cut my baby's cord, and it felt gross and rubbery. Honestly, I wish I had let the doctor do it.", "I was solo with my first with only my mom so she cut it, I was solo with my second and my firsts god mother cut it bc my mom was discovered to be a gremlin and felt entitled to my daughter and had caused problems bc she acted like she was a do over baby. She\u2019s not focused on the baby or you but her expectations even tho she was lucky you allowed her in the first place. Nta but play dumb and be clear that she should focus on the relationship with the kids vs harping on something you would have never changed", "NTA and mom is being ridiculously melodramatic.  However, an apology might smooth things over.  \u201cMom, I\u2019m so grateful you could be there for me.  I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly, you know what those moments right after birth are like.  I can\u2019t explain my decision, I\u2019m sorry I hurt your feelings.  Please don\u2019t read too much into my decision, I was so tired and sore and happy and overwhelmed and everything, I just wasn\u2019t sure in my right mind.  I love you, I\u2019m grateful you were there, grateful for a healthy baby.\u201d", "You have \"double standards\" as the relationship and role of mother and husband are... different considering that is his child you did a great thing protecting his \"firsts\" with his child. Your mom needs to pipe down. NTA", "NTA, but your mom sounds like a huge nightmare. Also, you should have one set of standards that you use for your husband and another set of standards you use for everyone else; that is literally the point of marriage. \n\nDon't fall for your mother's hysterics; she's probably just mad that all of the attention is on you and the baby and not her.", "NTA, if you didn\u2019t feel comfortable with your mom cutting the cord, your mom needs to respect that", "NTA. Of course you have double standards\u2026it\u2019s totally normal to prioritise a spouse over a parent!! In this scenario, when your husband really wanted to be there for the birth, there\u2019s nothing AHish about not giving those experiences to someone else.", "NTA\n\nYour Mum was in the room with you, that's special enough. She needs to put her big girl pants on and get over it.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t even have to find a reason it bothered you, you get to make that decision.", "NTA. Of course you have double standards for her and your husband. He is YOUR HUSBAND! The one with whom you made the baby!", "NTA - you had it in the birth plan for the FATHER to cut the cord.  She's not the baby's father.  I'm not sure which part of this she's not understanding.", "She\u2019s grateful without letting her cut the cord. One has nothing to do with the other.", "She gave her reason. Did you not read it?", "Do you regularly recommend that women use their bodies in ways they don\u2019t want to to convey gratitude?", "She is not entitled to her daughter\u2019s body. End of story.", "Complete stranger != medical professional"]}
