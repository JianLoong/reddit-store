Unfortunately her birth did not come without drama, which is the subject of my post today.\n\nMy husband and I were already parents to our wonderful son (M3), and when I went into labour, my husband and I had agreed with his parents (M65 and F63) that they would take our boy. My MIL and FIL have a very close relationship with our son, so he was thrilled at the idea of a sleepover with the two of them.\n\nUnfortunately, on his way home from their house, my husband was in a car accident. We were all very lucky that it was not worse, but my labour was progressing rapidly and I needed to go to the hospital. Ultimately it was decided that my best option was for my mom (F57) to take me to the hospital and my husband to meet us there when he could. Obviously the birth was a priority for him, and I do not for one second believe that he was dawdling at the accident or trying to take his sweet time.\n\nMy labour progressed much faster than with my first, and my husband was not yet at the hospital. While he was my designated support person, I made the decision to have my mom in the room with me when my daughter was born with the hope that my husband would arrive in time. Unfortunately, this did not happen.\n\nGiven that my mom became my support person, she was given a copy of my birth plan which included my husband cutting the umbilical cord. This was something he did with our first, and he would have liked to do again. However, given that it was now my mom with me, I really didn't want her to have that role. I can't tell you a specific reason why not, it just felt too intimate and like it was her baby. When it came time, I asked that the doctor please cut the cord, despite my mom offering. To be honest, she was all ready to do it by the time I asked the doctor that he do it, and my mom was quite taken aback. In the moment, she asked me why and said I had written in the birth plan that my support person do it and she was now my support person. I told her no, and it had been cut before she could get any further with her argument.\n\nThankfully our baby was born without any issues, and my husband was able to arrive in time to hold her. To be honest, I also didn't want my mom to hold her before my husband, so I did not let go of her until my husband walked into the room. I just wanted him to have all of those experiences, not my mom.\n\nNow, we have had a little while to adjust having our newest little one, but my mom won't let this go. She always moans that she was excluded from a more involved role despite being there for me when my husband couldn't, and she will never have a chance to make those memories again. She is upset about the fact that I have \"double standards\" for her and my husband, and says that this experience will throw a spanner in her building a meaningful relationship with her grandchild.

It's kinda weird she thinks it should be different. He didn't miss the birth by choice and her help on something like this shouldn't be conditional. Her whole purpose in being there should've been because you are her baby, not to somehow compete with your husband and his 'standing' in your life. Sounds like you knew in your gut to make that choice because I doubt she'd ever quit rubbing it in your husband's face that she'd cut the cord or held the baby before him if you'd allowed that to happen. She should be happy she got to be there, see the baby born, but instead she's getting salty about not getting more from what had to be an extremely stressful situation for you? If this interferes with her building a meaningful relationship with her grandchild, it will be because she chooses that path.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's your turn to make these decisions for yourself. She doesn't need to like it, just respect it.\n\nAs for it interfering with her ability to bond with her grandchild....did it interfear with her bonding with your 3yo? That's just an absurd attempt at a guilt trip, and quite childish IMO.", "NTA\n\nalso, wtf? \"double standards for her and my husband\"?. of course there are. one's husband and one's mother are not the same thing, so of course they don't get treated the same in all things. i mean, if mum feels hurt that she wasn't allowed to cut the cord since she was there, then ok. she can feel hurt about it. we're all entitled to what we feel. we are not, however, entitled to pushing that feeling onto someone else.", "NTA. The birth plan was written assuming your husband would be there. It was nice of your mom to support, but that doesnt mean she gets his rights of cutting cords and holding baby.

What an insane thing for your mom to be hung up on.\n\n\u201cMom, I hear that this has upset you, but if you can\u2019t let go of decisions I made after birthing a human being with my husband just having been in a car accident we\u2019re going to have a bigger problem.

I feel like if I drove you to the hospital I could have been your support person...  She just happened to be your only option at the time,  plus you were worried about your husband. Nobody but the person giving birth gets to decide about those intimate details so it's perfectly fine you didn't want your mum to cut the cord or hold that baby. You need to be firm with your mother: she wasn't your choice for a birthing partner,  she was just there. It doesn't make her anymore entitled than she was sitting at home waiting for news and if she doesn't stop going on about it you will pull the plug on any \"meaningful relationship\" with her grandchildren and stop her visiting altogether. And as for double standards... Your husband is a choice,  she's just there. He will always come before her.", "NTA.  The only way that this will harm your mother\u2019s bonding with the new baby is if she turns it into a problem that big.

This was something intimate that was reserved for your husband. Is mom also offended at not being a part of the conception?", ">She... says that this experience will throw a spanner in her building a meaningful relationship with her grandchild.\n\nPoint out to her that if this causes a problem with her relationship with her grandchild, that is a choice ***she*** is making, because the baby will not know or care.

Your birth plan was to have your HUSBAND cut the cord. You did GREAT not letting your mom do that. He had to miss the birth of your daughter due to an emergency. It wasn\u2019t like he was at home watching a football game. Your husband was already disappointed enough and having to listen to your mom after she cut the cord would have probably crushed him! Way to stick up for the father of your child and set boundaries with your mom.", "NTA. OF COURSE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR YOUR MOM AND YOUR HUSBAND!!!!!!!! You\u2019re supposed to!!!

She needs to get over it.", "NTA but I think your mom isn't a huge asshole, but YOU definitely are not.\n\nI think (and I'm saying this as someone who hasn't had a kid yet) in her shoes, I'd definitely be disappointed. She's probably never been on the other side of a birth like that, and it would be a cool experience to have as a mother. She's allowed to feel hurt, disappointed, upset, whatever. I get it. \n\nBut what she IS the asshole for is making her feelings your problem. I don't give a damn what your reasoning is. She has zero rights to any part of your laboring, your birth, or your child. She wouldn't have even been in there had there not been an emergency situation. You could have told her from the day you announced your pregnancy she was gonna cut the cord and then decided in the moment that you didn't want that and you'd still be NTA. Your body, your choice.\n\nShe is absolutely allowed to feel her feelings and her hurts and disappointment, and I'd say since it seems yall have a close relationship it might be kind of you to acknowledge that with her at some point to help her work through her feelings, but even that isn't a requirement for my verdict.", "Ehs this post was exhausting", "Nta\nHowever, why not your mother instead of the doctor? Based on your post, this was a very important thing that needed to happen by your husband yet in a pinch you insisted on a doctor who isn't family.\n\nYour mom was important enough to be in the room but not to cut the cord? I feel like there is a lot of missing info here. Do you and your mom have issues?", "It\u2019s your baby, your choice, but your mom did drop everything to rush to be by your side and support you.\nI don\u2019t understand why you couldn\u2019t let her cut the cord.", "As someone who had an emergency c-section then two difficult births, my husband could never cut the cord. He didn't care. All he cared about was that I was all right. That is all that matters. Why was it such a big deal to you? He's the dad and will be more involved in your child's life than your mom, why did you did you think she shouldn't do this? I really am confused by this. My mom was with my when I had my c-section. I don't know who held my kid first, her or my husband. I don't care. \n\nOh, yes, you had a birth plan. Like any birth goes to plan. Going against the grain YTA. You denied your mom holding her grandchild for the first time. She needed to bond as well.", "I mean, your mom is probably one of the only people in the world that truly loves you unconditionally. I don\u2019t blame her for being hurt that you didn\u2019t want to share that with her when you yourself came out of her body. There\u2019s nothing more intimate than that. She was there for you and it could be said she would have had way more empathy at that point than your hubby. It was almost unkind that you preferred a stranger do it than your own mom. That aside you are entitled to do whatever you choose. You obviously have your own reasons.

The obly thing that will impact her relationship with the baby is her attitude.", "NTA honey. Look, birth is a very deep and guttural thing. That moment in the birth is about supporting YOU. It isn't who gets to lay eyes on baby, stroke the cord or nibble the toes. This is you in your deepest, strongest and most vulnerable moment. You are literally RAW. This is a moment for you and the person you choose. And to have your one and only partner ripped out from your support in such a frightening way.... You make a plan and yes that is your birth plan, not your birth constitution. Nothing is written in stone. Unfortunately your mother is choosing to make this about herself. Your best bet here is to thank her for stepping in to support you in your most vulnerable moment. You love and appreciate her more than you can say, and you are so very grateful that she understands that a woman in that moment with her husband out of reach, emotions are high and weird. (She doesn't, but here's hoping she'll remember her own birth story) You are aware feelings get wrapped up in the excitement, but everything happened the way it needed to, and you are glad she could be with you when he couldn't. And then it would be wise to get her to share or remember her story. Please keep in mind, she may choose to take this personally, but you did nothing wrong. Once you thank her for stepping in and gently remind her your boundaries are still your own, she's going to make her own choices. Those choices are hers. You have to let that go, and cuddle that sweet little baby until she realizes she's missing baby cuddles too. She may come around, she may not. But hopefully a gentle reminder that the birth moment is about MOM will help. It's not the baby, the dad or the grandma. This is your moment, and you were an amazing warrior! I mean, depending how these comments go, maybe you can show her the post. \n\nGood luck, and enjoy your happy baby cuddles. \n\n*side note* best way to raise siblings, is to remind the 3yo \"this is YOUR baby\" and then the little one \"this is YOUR big brother\".

Quite seriously, I'd talk to her and tell her that if she will not shut up about this then *she* will be the reason she has no relationship with her grandchildren, because you will no longer be in contact with her. Period.", "NTA", "It's like all the wedding posts I see about whether or not it's \"fair\" to have a childfree wedding, but still include young siblings or niblings because their 3rd cousin twice removed might get offended that her 6 year old brat (whose fingers are somehow sticky 24/7 and has never heard the word 'no' in their life) wasn't allowed to be bored for 3 hours and disrupt the ceremony", "My babe is two months and I won't let anyone else other than my partner feed or kiss him. Parents get perks that other people don't, he's our baby and should have a different level of relationship with us.", "That double standards line absolutely sent me. Like okay we're dealing with an insane person.\n\nNTA", "I mean Op did mention the 3yo is much closer with MIL and FIL. Taking a look at Mom\u2019s attitude about this subject, no wonder why.", "Right I was like, usually it's the kid complaining about a parent not cutting the cord.. but the mom literally wanted to cut the literal cord! Disturbing and weird for mom to be so hung up on this. Very NTA, she can feel her feelings but she needs to stop throwing them around at everyone.", "Plus op is the one giving both suddenly WITHOUT her hubby because of a stressful situation. If she feels like she's leaving him out or he's being inadvertently betrayed in some way, even though it's not anyone's fault or within their control, THAT'S HOW SHE FEELS and it was so quick that is small in comparison to op being without her hubby and the father of her children in a very duel stressful situation.\nAnyone that makes it about them at this point is just TA.", "OP had all the hormonal stress of her husband having been involved in an accident, plus suddenly being faced with not being with him at a moment in their lives that will never be repeated, plus of course, all the regular hormonal madness of labor and childbirth. And THAT is the situation mom decided was the episode in her own child's life to turn into a bad thing that happened to HER. I mean, yikes. NTA op.", "Because she didn\u2019t want her too. She shouldn\u2019t compromise just to seem grateful. That\u2019s not an okay take .", "She wanted her husband to be first since he is the other parent. Parents bonding is more of a priority than a grandparent bond.", "That stranger is the person who she made that baby with. Who she plans to raise that baby with. The person she chose to marry. What is wrong with you?", "Yeah... not fully expecting different standards between you and your SIL is just bizarre and creepy. I always wonder about the relationship those people like the mom had with their own parents to end up with such a warped view.", "I'm wondering if maybe she got 'caught up' in the having the baby but NOT being the one physically pushing the baby out this time?\n\n Am I making the least bit of sense?\n\nOP, have a sit down with mom.  Explain your POV and ask her if the above is maybe what happened.  Talk it out.\n\n<shrugs> can't hurt.", "Her husband wasn't there, her mother was. The husband will be able to hold and cuddle the child more than the mother regardless who was there first. That's what's important. \n\nI'm gonna let you in a little secret. I gave my first child up for adoption. (This isn't a secret to my husband, he knew this when before I married him.) No one held her after she was born because she was born blue and not breathing. The docs rushed in to tend to her and got her breathing. They then rushed her into the NICU to monitor her. She survived and I was able to hold and feed her before I left the hospital.\n\nDo not start this BS about bonding and holding a child with me or any other mother who has had a child taken to the NICU nor any mother who has given an infant up for adoption. Just don't.", "What are you talking about? She said her husband wasn\u2019t there so a medical person cut the cord instead.", "Your answer had nothing to do with what I said. I still stand by that parents bonding is more important than a grandparent. \n\nMy sister was blue when she came out. Its very traumatic and im sorry to hear that happen to you. However i will always advocate for the parents getting to hold the newborn over a grandparent. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some mother who baby were in the nicu would be upset if their mil held their babies before them. Parents wants those special moments and they deserve them.", "Americans are so weird about their mothers", "You are the one who talked about op mom having more empathy than op husband. Next time dont jump to talking about someone else in the same paragraph. Makes it seem like you are still talking about them.\n\nIts a medical procedure to cut the cord. Many people have the medical person cut it. Op get to chose and you know who feels matter in that moment only op. It is selfish of op mom to keep bringing it up. Her feelings did not matter. She chose to be in that room and to support op. She failed by arguing with op."]}
