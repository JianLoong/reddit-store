My brother went into an extreme depression, rarely left the house and began to neglect their two girls. He refused to get help, and eventually quit his job and began living on their savings.\n\nOnce the money dried up, me and my wife began providing loans to him, which he never paid back. He eventually sold his house and moved in with us, while he looked for the right place. He never found that right place and from February last year until last month, he lived with us.\n\nHe never got a job and didn't pay rent. He would spend most of his days at bars and developed a drinking problem. I tried to stage an intervention with family but to no avail.\n\nHis girls suffered the most throughout all of this. I love his girls and consider them like my own. So when we discovered that their tuition wasn\u2019t being paid, I immediately confronted him. He put on a sob story about money struggles and how everything has been so hard since his wife died. I knew this was bs. He made a crap-ton on that house and spent nothing. I was pissed, but my wife was more sympathetic and convinced me to pay for them.\n\nNow we were paying for ourselves, him, our 4 kids and his girls. My brother was still dodging work, so my wife quit being a stay-at-home mom and got a job. She expected my brother to take over the household, but eventually we had to teach the kids to take over my wife's duties.\n\nI tolerated all of his bs, until this Valentines Day. My wife and I have a jar, where we throw in loose change or bills to save up for a trip for us two. Before this, my wife had put two $50 bills in the jar. We both took the day off and while I was at the store getting flowers, she texted me telling me the cash was gone. She said it couldn't have been the kids since it was still there when they left for school. I called my brother, who didn\u2019t answer, so I came home.\n\nHe wasn't home so my wife and I waited until he came home at around 7. I asked the kids (who had all denied it) to go upstairs. I asked him about the $100. He didn't lie and said something like; \"Oh, I thought it was the family change box. Yeah. I didn't have cash so I took it.\" I told him to pay it back, but he said he needed it more.\n\nI had reached my breaking point. I don't remember exactly what I said, but I went off, calling him a freeloader, a bludger and other things. He broke down and began mumbling about his wife. This was always his excuse. Get a job? My wife is dead. Help out around the house? My wife is dead. Stop drinking? My wife is dead.\n\nI told him that it doesn't mean he gets to be a freeloader and mooch off us. He said something like, \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore\u201d and left. I didn\u2019t follow him.\n\nThe next day, he had left with the girls to his in-laws. My kids, who heard it all, said I was in the wrong. My wife even said I was too harsh. While I regret \u00bd of the things I said, I just grew so sick of him that I feel I gave him a much-needed wakeup call.

I understand that he lost his wife, but his children lost their MOTHER. He needs to step the f up and do better, before his children lose their father as well. \nAnd kudos to you for supporting him for so long and letting him live off your back. He needs a different type of help though.", "When you\u2019re on the path to destroying your own family it\u2019s an issue. \n\nHe is an issue, yeah he\u2019s grieving, he lost the mother of his children. However the children are still here and he\u2019s done everything but be a father to the people in his life that need him the most. \n\nOne man was paying for several people and guessing op doesn\u2019t come from money so things are difficult regardless if u have the money/time to do so. That\u2019s money for your family in that home. \n\nNo I say NTA, you did your best, If he was paying you at least a little bit and trying to maintain his children\u2019s lives then I\u2019m sure you would feel more inclined but no.", "NTA. You were too harsh and should have collected yourself before going off, BUT he cannot use the past as an excuse for the present. He is a grown man and a father who needs to step up for his daughters when they need him the most. \n\nI hope he gets therapy and seeks out a program like AA to help as well cause from what you\u2019ve described he may have a drinking problem.", "This man needs therapy and the kids too. \n\nYou are right. He is a freeloader. \nYou are a family of 6 with your wife and kids but you paid everything for 9 people for more than 1 year !!!\n\n\nI\u2019m sad for them but NTA", "NTA, depression can make you unable to function, yes, but it doesn't make you a thief, especially when you've still got money in the bank. I'm sorry for his girls, but he is TA here.", "Nta im sorry but his kids are expected to go to school do homework and live life why isnt he expected to get out and go i understand loss is hard but you cant just quit and hes going to do same with the in laws he did with you im sorry he used you like that:( his wife would be so mad at him", "NTA. Maybe you shouldn't have raised your voice while the kids were around but anyone would reach their breaking point in 3 years. Brother has kids who depend on him, he needs to snap out of it now.", "NTA but he needs professional help", "NTA\n\nThe family has been through a lot, but it has been years and between SS survivor payments, the sale of their home, and the complete absence of bills while living with you - this guy should not be having any kind of cash problem. You can\u2019t drink that much money away. \n\nYour wife is a bloody saint for being willing to give up her needed role at home to get a job so you could afford your niece\u2019s tuition and he couldn\u2019t even treat your family with respect after that, which is more than 99% of families would have been willing to do.\n\nYour brother needed to go. If things get really bad, you can offer to take your nieces in, but unless he does a 180 - not him, no way.", "NTA - everyone is allowed to grieve and the grieving process takes different amounts of time for different people. Seemingly he has too much grief to actually do anything with his life other than sell his house and spend other people's money whilst neglecting his own children which is by far the biggest issue. I'm not buying it. Guy needs to get a grip if not for himself then his own children at least.", "He needs therapy and he needs to be a father to his children, which means getting a job. Losing your spouse is awful, but it doesn't give him the right to make other people responsible for him. NTA", "Not the AH! You went above and beyond for long enough, and at some point, it becomes enabling. He needs to get his life together. He is definitely using that as an excuse and needs to seek professional help if he's as bad as he says he is. Stand your ground, or you will be taken advantage of forever. He would not have responded to a less harsh confrontation, and you would have been stuck supporting him indefinitely.", "NTA\n\nYeah, that was harsh. You could have softened it a bit.\n\nWTF is he thinking, though? His kids have already lost their mother. The last thing they need is to lose their father, too.", "NTA, He needs more help than what you can do for him and enabling his behavior isn't going to help him stand on his own. What happened is horrible, but it didn't just affect him and he needs to focus on taking care of his children now. I hope he gets help.", "Life isn\u2019t fair, neither is death.  Yes its horrible when anyone dies, but the world stops for no one.  \n\nYour brother needs help, and at this point he can only do it for himself.  NTA", "NTA, yeah it\u2019s an unfortunate situation, but it\u2019s unfair that he thinks he should now go through life as essentially another child you and your wife have to take care of. And taking the money and saying he needs it more is the most clear cut example of entitlement I\u2019ve seen", "NTA what he went through sucks, but he didn't go through it alone, and he chose to abandon and neglect his kids. He refuses to try getting help, has turned to alcohol, and is now blatantly stealing. At some point, lines have to be drawn.", "NTA\nWhile I am sorry for his grief, he needed to hear it and unfortunately since everyone else is placating him he won't get better. Those poor children. If he was alone and decided to give up on life that's one thing but he is a father. He needs to sober up,get a job and rebuild his life.", "NTA, it has been 3 years. If it still affects him this much then he needs to go to therapy. Not mooch off family members!", "NTA. I have the misfortune of being a widow myself. Grief is weird and long and all around SUCKS both for the griever and those around them.\n\nBut you are correct. It is not an excuse to just stop living and just exist and consume- at least not for a period of YEARS. Bro needs a serious wake up call and to get into therapy asap.\n\nTherapy sucks too bc it's hard work! But the rewards FAR outweigh the inconvenience. He really really needs to see a grief counselor.", "NTA. It\u2019s a tragedy but he\u2019s hurting himself and everyone around him and that\u2019s not ok. You were harsh but it sounds like you tried the gentler approaches a few times and you reached the end of your rope.", "NTA... not really any good way to say it, unfortunately. You went above and beyond what most people would do, then kept going a while longer. But he needs real professional help, not an environment that enables him.", "If I died and my husband responded like your brother I'd be livid in the afterlife.  Your brother needs to step up. Nta", "NTA, your wife had to get a job to support him.  He is drinking up his money.  If he is still in such a deep depression, he needs to get in patient treatment for all of his issues.  He needs to get his life totally in order and the girls need to be in something stable, which is not being around him right now.", "NAH. Read about codependency and you will understand.", "The comments about \"he needs to wake up and snap out of it\" mean nothing. If waking up and snapping out of it were that easy. His excuse that \"he lost his wife\" is his truth. Sometimes truth can hinder us in ways unimaginable. it can lead us down paths we never thought we'd walk. Sometimes the path gets so dark, that everything that once was is now lost in the shadows. \n\nYou are right to have boundaries for yourself and what you are willing to help with. You helped as much as you could and understood only what you can. You won't fully understand as you have not experienced the same circumstances as he has. While we all have the thought of how we would go about things (given the same situation as his), isn't how things usually play out once they do happen. His is majorly depressed and what is happening is what his depression looks like. \n\nHim going to his in-laws sounds like it was the right move right now. The girls will be looked after while being away from the tension between you both. What is ahead of him is unknown. The word's \"I can't do this anymore\" seem more like a statement than a cry for help. That is the part that is worrisome. Many have said that and never said another word again. He needs therapy for him. He needs to do it for him before he does it for anyone else. He may have kids but honestly that doesn't help people to get better. For some it's their saving grace, for others it's a painful reminder and driver further into depression.\n\n If the in-laws or another family member can get temporary or even full custody while he is going through this, then that will be in the kid's best interest. It's better to focus on what can be done and what you can change instead of what you cannot. Giving \"wakeup calls\" is of no help because he will not hear them until he is ready. No point in yelling/screaming when one can't hear you among the screams in their own head. The best thing anyone can do right now is to persuade him. Persuade him to \"step up by stepping aside\". By him stepping up for the kids means he has to step aside. You may find he will agree to that. That doesn't mean it will make him a bad parent or person. In fact, he would be doing something very hard because he loves them and knows he is in a place he cannot care for them.", "On your version of events NTA but I would be very unsurprised if your wife or kids version paints a more lucid picture.", "YTA for forcing your kids to take on all the household chores so your wife can work to support your brother and his kids. It's been 3 years. He needs to get help or he can find another place to live.", "ESH. This is obviously an untenable situation and something needs to change ASAP. However, what I think you need to understand is that your brother *has* been genuinely traumatized by his wife\u2019s death. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t want to function\u2014it\u2019s that he can\u2019t. You\u2019re not going to be able to \u2018snap him out of this\u2019 or \u2018give him a wake-up call\u2019 because that\u2019s not how mental illness works. Quite honestly, you should have set expectations with him the second that he moved in with you\u2014i.e. \u201cif you\u2019re going to live here, you need to agree to go to grief counseling\u201d or something like that. Letting resentment fester and boil over isn\u2019t healthy and rarely leads to any kind of productive conclusion. \n\nYour brother needs to at least try to learn to live with his grief. Giving up isn\u2019t fair to his girls. Something needs to drastically change, and soon. It might be a good idea to consult with a crisis hotline/mental health professional to see what your options are here.", "ESH. What you said makes you an AH, but at the same time, he either needs to pull his head out of his ass or give his kids up for adoption.\n\nThe only way he's going to pull his head out of his ass is through therapy. Yes, his wife died, but he is dealing with survivor's guilt (survivors syndrome). It's a real problem, and it won't go away on its own.\n\n> I also live with it; I have good and bad days.  \n\nI still try and put a smile on my face regardless because people don't understand very well.  Opening my mouth sometimes is worse than saying nothing.\n\n\ud83e\udd37", "i know you're frustrated, but if everyone else thought you were being too harsh, then i think you were.  being frustrated doesn't give open license to unload those frustrations on him with wreckless abandon.   i don't know him, and you don't know what it feels like for him to lose his wife.  some people just can't handle such a loss.  clearly he just has no will to live anymore.  he  needs help though and he needs to seek help, therapy.  empathy usually goes over better than anger.

At that point, he had sold the house and we all thought he was moving on. We expected he would only stay for a few months until he found a place.
