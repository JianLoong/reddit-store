I had a severe allergy attack and when she came to check on my three hours later I was close to death and need critical medical attention. I was taken away on the basis of child endangerment. The reason she didn't have me in a daycare,was because of her own trauma from her childhood, she didn't trust other adults around me while she wasn't there. She was also diagnosed with PPD when she went to the required rehab for custody, which also played a role in her paranoia. She fought hard to get me back, she put herself in a 90 day program when she could've just done 30 just to make sure she would remain sober for me, she found a daycare that she trusted, got a higher paying job, moved to a nicer area, but none of it was enough. my parents both have six-figure jobs and their lawyer won easily. She was not permitted to see me after that.\n\nI know this shouldn't really change things for me, but it does. She loved me and she wanted to be in my life.

Your father sounds like a dick. Generally, I'd assume this is just a horrible scenario where your bio mother got better but the government didn't trust her anyone (for the right reasons) so you were placed with someone safer permanently. But the fact he's bragging about how she never stood a chance and has not even the slightest big of sympathy for her scenario shows that's he actually just a selfish AH. It's simple from the outside to say stuff like \"oh if they loved you enough you wouldn't have gotten taken away,\" but A, even if that was correct that's the biggest asshole thing to say ever. And B, people are not that black and white, things are complex and sometimes someone is trying their best and that still just isn't enough.\n\nI'm so sorry this happened to you, and I'm sorry you had to find out about it this young. At least if you were an adult you could have some space to think, but here your stuck around the gilt-tripping. Don't let them gaslight you over this, you don't have to be grateful. Remember, they didn't do this for you, they did it for them because they wanted a kid. That isn't to say they don't love you. But you shouldn't feel a responsibility to be thankful for this. For now, I'd recommend pretending you don't know. Seems like you can't actually access any help here, so it's probably better if you avoid conflict. Once your 18 you can decide what you want to do.

First, I am so sorry that you are going through this.  I am quite appalled by your parents' attitude and their remarks.  I am an adoptive parent, and it just makes me sad to hear this.  They are probably a bit scared (custody battles are tough on everyone - even those with the best of lawyers - no matter what they may say), but that is no excuse. It is not a love contest. Please don't feel bad about how you feel. I am glad to hear that your birth mom is doing well now and is helping others. That is very admirable. And the way you speak of her, it is obvious you are a very compassionate person. You are not being selfish; if anything, your parents are.  I hope they will realize their behavior is inappropriate and how negatively it affects you. You can love them deeply but not always agree with what they do or say.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nWhile it seems like you're definitely grateful for the life that you're adoptive parents gave you, you are in no wrong for wanting to try to understand your biological mother.\n\nI think at some point, when adoptive children get older, they should have the right to decide if they want to get to know their biological parents through open dialogue and understanding of the entire situation. Good, or bad. The choice should be theirs.\n\nIt sounds like your dad keeps this as some sort of trophy, when it should be more than that.

Just keep that in mind. Your birth mother wasn't the primary victim. You were.\n\nSeparately - what your dad said was not okay...gross, actually. Boasting that they had more money than your bio mum and thus 'won' isn't how I'd want to describe an adoption. They could have left the door open - even slightly - provided your bio mother proved she was sober and safe for you to be around.\n\nBut people don't always make the best decisions - your bio mum didn't and neither did your adoptive parents.

Your moms situation now does not mean she would have been a good mother had she had the chance to keep you and you were in a VERY dangerous situation.  You're parents are being incredibly judgmental of her, however as adoptive parents there is a fear of losing their child. And you are stuck at such a young age reflecting on this and being caught in the middle.  I refuse to judge anyone in this because there are so many emotions involved, though your adoptive parents are very close to being the AH here in how they are treating you about these revelations.    \n\n\nOP, I will say you are not an AH for your emotions.

Your emotions are all so valid. You story struck close to home because my husband and I want to adopt and we only want to do open adoption because of this and so many other stories. There is a reason fostering always puts parental reunification first. It is almost always better for a child to be with their biological parent even if it means being adopted but still maintaining a healthy relationship with bio family. I am so very sorry how awful youe bio parents are being to you. You are not a puppy who needed rescuing. You are a human being who had a mother who loved you. Maybe she wasn't the best option as a primary caretaker but I imagine a healthy open adoption would have done wonders. You deserve so much more than youve been given.", " NTA. I\u2019m an adoptive parent and former therapeutic foster carer. What your adoptive parents did was highly unethical, and should not actually have been permitted by the courts (in the US or Canada anyway.) \n\nHonestly it\u2019s disgusting that you were removed in the first place instead of, you know, just providing your mum with daycare. She sounds like a badass lady. The ethics around infant and little kid adoption in particular - even through the public system - can be murky because many people want to adopt babies and toddlers.\n\nEven if it was in your best interest to be adopted, there was no reason why your parents couldn\u2019t have facilitated some type of relationship with your first family including your siblings. My kids were older when they entered care so they already knew their family, and I \u2018let them\u2019 see the members they want to see, whenever they want. You were only adopted 16 (or fewer) years ago, not 50; open adoption and the importance of honesty and genetic connections, was already very well known. \n\nI\u2019d recommend crossposting this on r/adoption.

Your adoptive parents are cruel people. \n\n(You will hear a lot of people say \"you should be grateful\". Adoptee voices are drowned out by choruses of things like that. They chose to do this.

That first relationship was severed. \n\nThat's traumatic. No matter what came later, that's an enormous loss for you both. \n\nI cannot even imagine the pain of decorating your child's room with flowers so that they would be somewhere beautiful, only to discover that the flowers had harmed the child. \n\nOf course hearing your mother described as \"trash\" and learning how much she went through trying to give you the life she wanted for you changes things. \n\nAnd many adopted people have the kind of experience you described. I would encourage you to get to know some adult adoptees -- at least at a distance by reading their work (please be safe on the internet) -- and consider asking for a therapist with experience with adoptees, and explore to what extent your experience is like others'. \n\nEither way though, you do not owe your adoptive parents gratitude for raising you. That's a choice they made and you didn't. You may be tied to them by love and history, and many other emotions, and you may choose to not address this with them to spare their feelings or to spare yourself having to listen to their feelings. \n\nBut you are not TA for having these feelings, nor for expressing them. That's one of the things about committing to a child: you're committing to being there for them through whatever that child ends up dealing with -- which may not be at all what you expected. \n\nGood luck. May the next phase of your journey be easier.", "NTA.  Your parents are just salty you want to connect with your real mom.  But tbf, your real mom could've killed you.

Your mom made mistakes but she tried her damnedest to get you back, only to be completely stomped on by high priced lawyers.  Your mom lost custody of you because she was poor, and their motives don't appear to have had anything to do with your best interest.  If it did, they would've fought to keep your bio mom in your life.  The fact that your dad is boasting about it tells me they pretty much did it because they could.", "NAH. I completely think your feelings are legitimate. Your dad sounds very unempathetic to your birth mom but please try to be compassionate with him.

Maybe talking or thinking about her reminds him of the trauma of seeing you ill or losing you through the courts\n\nIt\u2019s lovely that you have so much compassion for your birth mom. Extend that compassion to yourself (and, when you have it within you to your adoptive parents as well). It absolutely sucks that they aren\u2019t extending sympathy to you (and by extension your birth mom) but love and parenting are very primal things and I think it sounds like they\u2019re trying very hard to protect your family unit.\n\nI hope, over time, all of you can learn to meet each other in the middle.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like you're romanticizing your mother.

It's not that your parents didn't want to share you, it's that they didn't trust her. Can you blame them? Due to her negligence you nearly died!

Is that right? Also, were her rights terminated due to the child endangerment? \n\nIn that case your bio mom\u2019s situation was tragic, but comments in this thread saying your adoptive parents lawyers bullied or bulldozed your bio mom miss the mark a bit. It\u2019s more complicated than that. Once you were adopted, your adoptive parents had a legal and emotional investment in you as part of their family.

Adoptees don\u2019t need to feel \u201cgrateful\u201d anymore than bio children need to be, and your bio mom was under a really difficult set of circumstances and it sounds like she did her best to turn her life around.

How was she supposed to raise me when you wouldn't let her around me\" to which then got dad to tell me I was ungrateful. Then I asked if they were ever gonna tell me i was adopted, and my mom said no. If I never found out, they never would've tolf me. Which made me upset because I feel like I should have the right to know that and the fact that my bio mom wanted contact with me as I got older to make my own responsible and mature decisions. It was a shouting match from there and I left the convo in tears.", "Dogs get better paperwork than adoptees. People don\u2019t need to know birth parents - but medical information about diseases and addictions would be really helpful.\n\nDad was wildly inappropriate. This is why blind adoptions may be better.\nOP is curious - makes sense. OP does admit life is pretty good (nothing is perfect).\n\nMy perspective as an adoptee.", "I came to say the same thing.   OP, I\u2019m so sorry that you are going through this, but Reddit isn\u2019t the place.   Please delete and talk to. Pastor, therapist, school counselor\u2026 this is going to take awhile to work through.   Much Love and hugs to you", "No, I've just been internet stalking her. What I did learn from a a background check i did though is that she's never had custodial issues with her other two children, never been back to rehab, and all the trouble she's gotten into with law since then is a parking ticket.", "OP this! ^ Dad said something he shouldn\u2019t have and then, when it sent you on a hunt for your bio mom, both of your parents doubled down on saying the wrong thing by calling you ungrateful. It\u2019s possible due to fear of losing you or just hurt that you want to make a connection with a woman who nearly killed you. But ultimately your bio mother was making incredibly neglectful choices in raising you and only tried to get help after you were removed from her care. She was very young and alone and had she been able to regain custody of you at that point in your life there\u2019s no telling how things might have ended up. She was already struggling physically with her drug addiction and emotionally with her childhood traumas; adding the stress of a young child back into that mix\u2026 really there\u2019s no point in the what ifs. \n\nOP you are entitled to your feelings. Your parents said some judgmental things about your bio mom and whether they meant it or not they hurt you. Ask to work things out with a family counselor. Also you being curious and wanting to know about your bio mom and possibly reconnect with her is a very natural thing, but again something that should only be approached with the help of counseling. It already sounds like you might have started creating an image of her based on what you\u2019ve found out so far and it might not be the reality you are hoping for. No judgements, just approach everything with caution and compassion and a good therapist on your side. I hope you are able to reconnect with all your parents and have them all as support going into adulthood.", "OP's parents absolutely are AHs for how they've been treating OP. There is no \"very close to being the AH\", no maybe, no kind of. They said OP is ungrateful and punishing them for loving OP; that is shitty and manipulative. They are adults; they need to act like it. Sadly, OP appears to be doing a better job on that score.", "[removed]", "No one could've known how she would pan out. But as I've been internet stalking her recently, she panned out very well. She's never had custody problems with either of her other kids (I know because I did a background check). She works at a law firm for defense for juveniles. The area she lives in is mostly six-figure income area. Not to mention if it's anything to go by her daughter, 14 has her own social media accounts, and that girl LOVES her mom. She's always posting things like \"best mom,\" and they are always doing something really fun together that the daughter posts about on Instagram. And every year for my birthday, she posts about me with the few baby pictures she has. I know you can't truly know a person from the internet, but I don't know many kids in their teens who post so publicly about their parents. And she's married now to her other two children's dad. Who she's been with for 15 years. So yeah, it doesn't seem like she turned out too bad. Sorry for the excessively long comment. I just wanted you and other people to know what she became later in life.", "Yeah way NTA. \n\nAlso OP, I would suggest seeking out counseling for yourself. Someone who is trained to help you navigate your feelings towards your adoptive parents now and your birth mom. They might be able to help you on your journey if you\u2019re interested in meeting your birth mom and other siblings. \n\nIf nothing else, they would give you some tools on how to help you handle these big emotions and feelings.", ">Your mom lost custody of you because she was poor, and their motives don't appear to have had anything to do with your best interest.  If it did, they would've fought to keep your bio mom in your life.\n\nNo, she lost custody because she was a neglectful drug addict, and her father kept her away... from a drug addict.", "This!! It's tough to like an adult when the adults around you are not, but it's a good opportunity for you to take some time to process, readjust your world view, then ask yourself what you want, now that you have this info. That decision doesn't need to be based on others feelings, but might require you to be over 18 to pursue. The good news is you have time and know that everyone clearly loves you and that's a blessing!! Highly recommend therapy as this is a lot to process!! Maybe your parents would support that while you work through these issues?", "I was in the apartment she was renting in my crib. And yes, she would leave me alone for three hours and then come back to check on me on her breaks.", "I know and the story I told on here was the story I got from my dad's account of things and what her lawyer argued in her defense and all that. I didn't put her spin on it because I know her view is biased. Her story did have some slightly different accounts from the way my father told it, but I posted the general drift of the things they both recounted in the same way.", "Thank you for this point of view. I don't plan on contacting her any time soon, I just need to mull things over. I love both of my parents, and you're right. I probably am romanticising what could've been. I just feel very all over the place. I do want to know if she was sincere or not, and it's that question that keeps eating at me.", "Yes, what I posted on here is what her lawyer argued in her defense, which my dad told me about when I asked about what happened.", "My adoptive parents were fostering me. And decided they wanted to adopt me two months in of my bio moms rehab. By the time she got out, I was not legally adopted by them by them, but they were already fighting for it.", "I don't know. I figure it wouldn't be an option until I'm at least 18 but I don't know if I'll even still want to know about her at that point.", "I was not eavesdropping. I was in the next room which is our \"movie theater\" room, watching a new movie. My dad was with his friends in the next room and the were all very loud rowdy and drunk and I could hear what they were saying even with door closed and the TV up loud. I value privacy so I would never intentionally eavesdrop I just happened to hear what my dad said.", "Really. That\u2019s what you got from this tragic story? Ugh gross.", "I am going to take your comment as a poor attempt at sarcastic humor.  Otherwise, YTA. :(", "You failed reading comprehension didn't you?", "So that makes up for literally bullying someone into submission? (which is exactly what happened when people with money could hire the best lawyers, knowing that the biological mom was probably lucky if she had a public defender-type of situation)", "still NTA (and I didn't think that would change). What your dad said was not okay and i don't see any way i can take his side on anything he's said in your recalling of the events. Your mom saying she never planned on telling you that you were adopted is also imo the wrong choice. If you put yourself in your mom's shoes for a second though, I really think she loves you and love makes people do irrational things like lie and hide the truth out of the fear of losing who they love. However, I don't like how she said your bio mom wouldn't \"deserve\" to see you. Your adopted parents are villainizing your bio mom too much for what seems like considerably little information/reason aside from one slip up.\n\nMy mom dropped me when i was younger and it was a life endangering drop down the stairs, or something like that, completely by accident. By some miracle I was completely fine. I wasn't taken away from my mom and it wasn't even a question. She's the most loving person I know and I can tell by the contexts in which it comes up that she probably feels guilty about it semi regularly even 23 years later. I don't see how your explanation of your mom's slip up is much different albeit a little scarier and more public due to the hospitalization.\n\nBecause I relate to the (bio) mom almost killed me part of the story, I think it's unfair for your parents to demonize your bio mom so harshly.\n\nedit: after reading some other people's inputs I want to step it back a little and also say i am NOT a mental health expert nor is anyone else on here and the best person to talk to would be some kind of therapist or family counselor. Your situation is complex, I just am not a fan of the villainizing.", "OP, please remember it takes so much more than donating an egg to be a mother. Anyone can become a biological parent, but your parents actually choose you and faught for you, do you know that social services are usually more on the side of the biological parent? There is a reason the court approved your adoption. Money has nothing to do with it (affording a good lawyer) the state also has good lawyers and I am sure you bio mom was appointed one.\n\nYou hurt your bio parents, I am sure there is so much more to the story that your parents might not be telling you, as not to hurt you. Your parents raised you and loved you and you need to respect them and trust their decisions.", "I won't have anyone professional to talk to until I'm eighteen. My parents don't believe in \"counseling\" \"therapy\" etc. And my pastor is way too close to both of my parents for me to feel comfortable talking to him. That being said professional help may be something I seek out when I turn eighteen.", "My parents don't believe in therapy but maybe I'll consider it when I'm 18. Thank you for your input!", "Maybe, but we don't have the wording of the conversation and sometimes emotional conversations can lead to words being said on both sides.  Without that context I refuse to judge as the AH, and I don't think asking OP to relive every single word of that conversation for needed context is worth it or conductive.

The whole time I was in her custody, she was sober. And yes, she was neglectful but not out of carelessness but paranoia that was partly caused from having Post partum depression.

You should never have to be grateful to your parents for basic parenting -- whether those parents are by birth or adoption. Adults have children, or adopt them, for their own reasons. There is no right to gratitude in exchange for doing the basic job of a parent. \n\nAll that said, don't go too far overboard.

They can be wrong and still not terrible people.", "Good thing I'm not the one asking for judgement.", "Yes.", "My dad was really drunk when he told me about what happened.

I love them both to death.
