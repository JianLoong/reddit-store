My parents also made financial gambles. Used a HELOC as capital for the family deli or took out a 2nd lien against the house. I know it's frowned upon but they did it for us and their options were slim with language barriers and no other $ backstop. Just sharing as your description of your in-laws resonated w me. \n\nAnyhow, those of us (my siblings and I) that can, send money home. Those of us that can't, find ways to help out around the house, etc. At some point, our parents will need to either downsize, have assisted living, or live with atleast one of us -- perhaps my 2nd oldest sister and/or my house as we too are the \"breadwinners\".", "Why not buy a small apartment and have the siblings still pay an amount to help cover extras.

Yes, you can afford more on the finance side, but should you be expected to forgo your retirement savings, kids college funds, etc?

Because of the above, her family will try to guilt and manipulate her to get more money out of both of you.  She needs to set firm boundaries with them and learn with a therapist how to overcome her guilt.\n8.
