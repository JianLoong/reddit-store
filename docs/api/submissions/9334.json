My parents also made financial gambles. Used a HELOC as capital for the family deli or took out a 2nd lien against the house. I know it's frowned upon but they did it for us and their options were slim with language barriers and no other $ backstop. Just sharing as your description of your in-laws resonated w me. \n\nAnyhow, those of us (my siblings and I) that can, send money home. Those of us that can't, find ways to help out around the house, etc. At some point, our parents will need to either downsize, have assisted living, or live with atleast one of us -- perhaps my 2nd oldest sister and/or my house as we too are the \"breadwinners\".", "Why not buy a small apartment and have the siblings still pay an amount to help cover extras.

Yes, you can afford more on the finance side, but should you be expected to forgo your retirement savings, kids college funds, etc?

The ones doing the care don't also pay.", "NTA. There are far better options for not only you but your wife and marriage than having your in-laws move in. They will move in, become entrenched and takeover your home. Perhaps as a compromise if you can afford it get them a small home or condo in your name that you own but they only have to cover the bills and personal expenses for. This is only a suggestion but it gives them a place to live that's not your home but still a secure living situation.", "Nta. They can get on waiting lists for senior housing and or low income housing. You might not want to broadcast your lifestyle on social media.\n\nThere are also senior food programs, and low income cellphone and internet services. And food banks.", "I'd get divorced before I left my partner move their parents in and ruin my home environment. One of the reasons I'm not married. NTA. The parents could live for another twenty years. No thanks.", "Sounds like a plan to me. \n\nFor the record, my mom is 71 and has a job just because she\u2019s bored, sooooo - I think they can roll up their sleeves and pitch in. Her parents remind me of Grandpa George - man laid flat on his back until that chocolate factory opened up, then he was good to go. Helping them is one thing, but that\u2019s a shared responsibility. The parents have a shared responsibility to act like adults and contribute to improve their own situation. Their children have a shared responsibility to support their struggling parents. Don\u2019t let any of them off the hook.", "And what do you bet if one of them loses a rental or has bad times, they take this as precedent to vote big sis and OP kick in again?", "I couldn't do it, and have already decided that it won't happen if one of my parents gets to that stage.\n\nMy mother is my best friend, and she spends nearly every Tuesday with me.  But by afternoon, I am ready for her to go home.  I am an introvert, and having someone WITH me all the time (as opposed to my husband and kids who are there but doing their own thing mostly) really wears me out.  Add to that the thing about Mums feeling free to comment on everything - it's too much.\n\nOf course, I'd probably change my mind if she was really in need.  But thankfully my dad has told me there is plenty of money for them to go into care if necessary.  They'll be avoiding it until the last possible moment but acknowledge it may be needed some time.", "The risk of turning your life into a living hell and making your home a place that you don't want to be is far too high to move forward. The worst case scenario is horrible, the baseline scenario is bad and even the best case scenario probably sucks", "If she doesn\u2019t there is always divorce. Reddit always jumps to this, but yeah, this would be a case for it", "Something to consider is that as they get older, their needs will grow and you may not be able to help them.  My grandmother is 95, suffering dementia, and constantly says she wants to leave the home she lives in and live with my parents instead.\n\nMy parents physically cannot do it.  Grandma needs assistance with showering and all sorts of other things.  My parents are mid 70s, have a few health issues of their own due to their age, and simply cannot do what needs doing for my grandmother.\n\nThat's not even considering the mental wear of having a dementia parent and having that person there constantly.  She can't be left alone.  My parents would have to give up much of their own lives.  The home she lives in is very good, and she was the one who pushed to go there (before the dementia), but her dementia makes her have delusions.\n\nYou and your in-laws are not in those age groups yet, but it might come.  And just think - this is 20-30 years ahead.  Imagine having them there for that long.  It's longer than you'd have kids at home, usually!", "And they don\u2019t get a say in how you use, or don\u2019t use, \u2018your space\u2019", "Put your pants on and inform  them they have 2/3 Months  to find a job/apartment  and move out.  Start eviction  if necessary after 1 month . You don't need to support  anyone,  it's great to help your mil  bit you didn't signed up to support the extended family.", "My dad is 75, with a bad back, and is nearly blind in one eye, and he's still out there working.  I'm seconding this, there's no reason they can't at least do part time."]}
