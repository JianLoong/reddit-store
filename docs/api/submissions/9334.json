They all voted YOU should take over everything?  That was easy for them.  How about in-laws live with one of the other sibs in lieu of their contribution and you send your contribution to THEM?  How about the in-laws get part-time jobs to supplement their pension?  Unless they have significant health issues, they are NOT too old to work.  It\u2019s kind of you to have pitched in as much as you have\u2014stop while you\u2019re ahead.", "NTA they\u2019ll be living with you at least a decade if not 2-3 more. Love how they voted like they have a say in your finances.", "Caregiving is a major responsibility that indefinitely affects everyone\u2019s lives: you, your wife, and your children. Sure, your in laws may seem to live independently now, but that will wear away with age\u2026.and faster than you\u2019ll think.  Assuming that they will live full healthy lives, you\u2019ll be stuck with them under your roof for at least another 15 years or more, taking care of all of their needs.  As a caregiver of my MIL, my wife and I have to increasingly devote time to her as she\u2019s getting physically and mentallly weaker, which takes time away that we want to spend with each other and our kids while they\u2019re still young.  And now her and my wife fight all the time because they have no personal space anymore.  It\u2019s one of the biggest mistakes we\u2019ve ever made.  Respectfully fight this as much as you can. NTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd IF you did take them in, the brothers should still chip in.  They have the same obligations to their parents that your wife does.  And to be clear, you are under no obligation to do so.", "NTA. The family got together and decided how to spend your money. Very nice of them wasn't it? s/ You are doing your part to support your in-laws.\n\nHowever, you and your wife need to work this out between the two of you, without the family interfering any more.", "NTA but I would have an open mind about what other options might work for supporting them. These sort of things vary a lot vis-a-vis family and culture.\n\nMy family grew up in subsidized housing early on and thankfully my (three) siblings and I have done okay $-wise. My parents also made financial gambles. Used a HELOC as capital for the family deli or took out a 2nd lien against the house. I know it's frowned upon but they did it for us and their options were slim with language barriers and no other $ backstop. Just sharing as your description of your in-laws resonated w me. \n\nAnyhow, those of us (my siblings and I) that can, send money home. Those of us that can't, find ways to help out around the house, etc. At some point, our parents will need to either downsize, have assisted living, or live with atleast one of us -- perhaps my 2nd oldest sister and/or my house as we too are the \"breadwinners\".", "Why not buy a small apartment and have the siblings still pay an amount to help cover extras. At the end at least you\u2019ll have an apartment that you can sell rather than just losing the money.", "NTA\n\nIt's not easy to live with other adults.", "NTA\nAs much as I love my parents who live with me (because they lost everything) and have for a very, very, tediously long time. I would do anything at this point for some privacy and not have someone looking over my shoulder every time I do something. It's all day, every day. Think about that.", "NTA.  Stick to your guns on this.  Your in laws have already shown that they do not make good choices.  As for the other siblings, tell them to pound sand.", "I was at NTA just reading the title.\n\nYou're marriage is over if you let you're in-laws move in.", "NTA ... Your wife might not be so great with it after a while.\n\nSomething you might consider is a granny suite.  An apartment of their own, either inside your home, as a small addition, or over a garage. That sort of thing is how many of my peers have been handling it. The problem that needs to be resolved hard and firm is that they don't get to encroach on your lives.  They stick to their space unless invited, and no guilt.  If your wife doesn't think they'll stick to that boundary, don't do it.\n\nBut no, sharing your space with them will just open up room for lots of invasive conflict.\n\nI lived with my daughter and son in law, our of my province, for a while after the baby came.  We were all playing very nice because it was a temporary thing, and we wanted it to work and have good memories.  But actually LIVING with them indefinitely?  No.  No.  They need their space, their lives, and I need mine.  We did great for that limited time, but not going to do it permanently.", "NTA  Why should you be responsible? I like that they had a meeting to decide you should not only house but pay for their parents. You should have a meeting of your own where you vote they should take care of their own family and stop trying to pawn it off on someone else. The people that are telling you you're wrong and a bad guy are the same people in your wallet.", "NTA\n\nI'd bet money that your sister(s)-in-law also said they aren't letting the in-laws move in with them. The single brother(s) probably don't want mom and dad keeping track of the times a girlfriend (or boyfriend, or just friend with benefits) sleeps over.\n\nSit down with your wife and talk this over. Bring up any issues that happened when the in-laws stayed overnight with you, even if it was just complaints about your neighbor's dog barking or your teenager's music. Point out that the government pension may not fully cover the in-laws' needs. Ask what her brothers would be expected to contribute and how you'll get that money out of them. Talk about any other possible issues that you think are likely to come up.", "Why does it always fall on the most successful, financially stable, reliable sibling? You worked hard and built your life together. I\u2019m not saying to be heartless, but, damn, just because you have more doesn\u2019t mean you have to give more. Yes, you can afford more on the finance side, but should you be expected to forgo your retirement savings, kids college funds, etc? Is it possible one of the other siblings takes them in and you continue to contribute to funds to care for them? Or you all chip in for a independent living facility? Do not let them move in, being full time caregivers is really hard.", "NTA\n\nWhat your wife's family are asking for is a divorce with extra steps, because more often than not, this kind of situation ends in tears.", "Nta they are not too old for work unless they have early medical issues, in which case they need to work on getting better benefits.", "None of this is \u201cfair\u201d to you, but there comes a certain point where you (and your wife) have to consider what kind of lifestyle you can really accept for them. Do you really want to see them homeless, hungry, or without medical care? If not, you probably have to shoulder the burden because no one else will. You\u2019re certainly not AH for it, but the pragmatist in me doesn\u2019t see a lot of other options. \n\nYour best bet is to find them a cheaper place to live, rent to them yourself, or try to find them work.

What they decided for YOU was massively inconsiderate, just ridiculously presumptuous and rude.   \n   \nNot sure who thought your in-laws were too old to work. My parents did volunteer work well into their 80s, and my aunt is still working at walmart at the age of 88. Our friends let their 81 year old great-aunt live with them much to their regret. She left the gas on, flooded the bathroom, etc, resulting in costly repairs.   \n   \nAre you prepared for them to have increased dependence on you for caregiving needs, medical bills, hospital stays? Adjustable beds, depends, prescriptions, canes, wheelchairs, accidental falls, etc. Perhaps you will have to deal with tiffs or arguments. Their presence will likely drain your bank account and your patience and your freedom. The list goes on and on.   \n   \nWhile I have the greatest respect for multi-generational homes, you need to sit down with your wife and carefully examine this from all angles. See if there is HUD housing available specifically for assisted living for elderly people. Can you afford a nurse or caregiver? Hope you are able to come to a consensus that benefits everyone and truly envision the reality of all that it will entail.  \n   \nThe very best of luck to you!", "NTA and don\u2019t let them push you around.

I'm in a similar situation and there are lots of ways to help without overstepping boundaries. You can help with some bills or groceries monthly.

You need to sit down with your wife and draw the line.", "Your in-laws are not yet actually elderly. They could live another 30 years!

Look for other solutions (retirement community, living with a different relative, etc). You can keep contributing IF you want to, but don't sell your peace in your home for anything.", "Yeah I\u2019d rather pay for assisted living than ever having them in my home tbh.

You know what you can tolerate & what your firm lines are. This is OP's hard boundary.", "And that's when he grabs his bags, the kids, and turns right back around out the door. You don't move people into your house without consulting your spouse especially if you know the spouse is dead set against it.", "You could write up a legally binding contract with them & get it notarized by lawyers, you and wife will pay for accommodation, but they will cover the cost of care. You will have a higher cost now, but lower in the long run, and you could sell the apartment. They get an easier time now, but cost will ramp up as age starts to claim your M&FIL. \n\nThe lawyer bit is to stop them weaseling out of it when their costs start ramping up.", "Ouch, yeah, I know. There have been positives for sure. My kids absolutely love the extra attention and time, and I got the very occasional babysitting. My mom is a I raised my kids you raise yours mind off person. If I had the money, it would have been ideal to set them up in an apartment. \nI'm lucky they're genuinely good people, but everyone needs space. \nI hope it all works out for you. And don't let her family be dead beats and take advantage of you.", "No, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong. You\u2019re not responsible for them, and you\u2019re certainly not to blame for their misfortune. But the siblings aren\u2019t either\u2014children shouldn\u2019t have to take care of parents financially. The \u201cfair\u201d thing to do is let them struggle on their own. \n\nBUT, my guess is that your wife couldn\u2019t live with herself\u2026 so if you want to keep your marriage together, you should make sure you\u2019re 100% on the same page before you change anything. If her siblings choose to stop contributing, you don\u2019t have to pick up the slack, but you will potentially have to watch your children\u2019s grandparents go hungry. Bringing the in-laws into your house is also a marriage killer. I\u2019m definitely not encouraging that either. The best thing is if you can find a way to help them be independent."]}
