I've kept him off school (doctor's advice) since, but he's beginning to ask to go back.\n\nSo, I sit down with Mrs G, and we begin discussing what adjustments need to be made to help my son cope, as he is very slow walking, on one crutch, and can't go up stairs. Mrs G started off nice, as she usually does, before turning quite rude. (Please bare in mind my son is in the room with me) she refuses to make any adjustments and tells me to \"just make him get on with it\". I explain to her that he has a disability but she dismisses me. Then she says this:\n\n\"He just doesn't want to return to school because he dislikes sport - he's fat and needs the exercise to lose weight.\" I was furious. It was completely irrelevant and uncalled for, and she's done this (fatshamed my son) on at least 5 separate occasions, and it really had an effect on his mental health. This is a private school, so I pay fees for this sort of behaviour from Mrs G. I'd let her get away with it before, but not now. I said \"If we're being unreasonable, you're in no position to talk - look in the mirror.\"\n\nMrs G looked shocked and offended, and my son burst out laughing. From conversations I've had she had bullied \n multiple children, parents and even staff like this before, but nobody had done this. I said \"see, not very nice, is it?\" She started muttering something about expelling my son and I said \"I would like an appointment with somebody professional enough to handle an adult conversation next time. Good day, Mrs G.\" and walked out on her almost in tears. \n\nMy wife is upset because she thinks I was rude and it could get my son kicked out, but I told her somebody needed to stand up to Mrs G, and the school wasn't worth going to if the headmistress was like that.

In fact, you could have lashed out way worse and still been in the right. Also, the risk of being kicked out shouldn\u2019t be about anything a parent does anyway. \n\nI have to ask, and I hope this isn\u2019t rude, but why stay at this school if this is the treatment your son is getting ?

I would love to hear the update to this one.", "NTA.. and you will have her job if she goes after your son", "YTA, although she totally deserved it, you're paying private school fees to this school.

Or move your son to another school.", "I'm waiting for the call from my close friend, the chairman of the board of directors.", "Check OPs post history.  It screams teenage boy vibes, not middle aged father.  Something is fishy here.", "Don't worry, I'm waiting on a call from the chairman of the school board, who's son is best friends with mine and I know personally. I let it slide the first five times because I didn't want my son to get expelled, but now I'm thinking screw this!", "Yep. I'm on hold to my personal close friend, the chairman.", "My son moved from a public school because he was horrendously bullied to the point of severe depression. He loves the school he's at at the moment, it's literally just Mrs G who's like that - all the other teachers and his friends are lovely, especially the deputy head, who's next in line for headmistress. Mrs G is close to retirement age so we hope she'll leave before long.", "Yeah because I've posted this on someone else's behalf, not that that is relevant! Why were you looking at my profile anyway?", "So you believe that he should\u2019ve set an example where his son would learn that it\u2019s ok to be walked all over? Treat others how you want to be treated always. The dad is 100% correct fight fire with fire if needed.", "She requested my son to be there, and there's no other schools in the area apart from the one he was bullied out of.", "How is he the asshole when she can\u2019t keep herself from bullying little kids?

And it's always worth a look at post history as people frequently make up stories/ steal and repost other people's stories to farm kama and get awards.\n\nNext time use a throw away account it would make it more believable.", "Exactly. The dad treated the teacher in a fatphobic way, signalling to the son that was okay. It does not matter that it was in response. If you cannot think of a way to respond where you aren't walked all over then I'd recommend practicing. Personally, I would go with something like \"The unprofessionalism you have shown in this meeting and our meetings prior have gone on for long enough. I will be escalating this straight to the school board and principal, and until that happens you will communicate no further with my son as you have repeatedly shown that you are incapable of being appropriate.\"  \nIf what you actually mean is that the only way not to be walked over is to insult someone, then that's just a character flaw.", "Those aren't the only two options. Look, I'm cheering for dad standing up for his kid with a zinger. But as popular as that response is, it was AH behaviour.\n\nBetter to have taken a breath and said \"that's the fifth time you've insulted my son and this time it's when he needs the support of this expensive private institution. If you cannot be professional in this circumstance then this meeting is over. I will be reaching out to the superintendent to discuss your behaviour. Good day.\n\nI said good day!\"", "Doesn't mean he had to be. It's your son and principle's don't have the right to order parents to do anything. Specially when they pay private school fees.", "He's the asshole because you don't act that way in front of your kids, without them there, fine. the fact that the 14 year old scoffed at the comment is ridiculous.", "How am I enabling? Just because the Headmistress tells you to bring the kid, doesn't mean you have to, specially if you already have issues with her.  Already moved to another school, why?", "She doesn't know the entire picture - she knows that I know him, but not the extent of our friendship.", "She's got a board of directors above her, which I'm phoning up right now.", "I didn't mention it because I don't see the relevance to the story. You can check the entire subreddit if you want - it's not stolen. My neighbour's currently having issues, and wanted a third opinion. I told him about the sub and he said he wanted me to post this. I'm currently sat with him and giving him my phone to answer comments.", "No, you\u2019re changing the story, she treated the kid in a fat phobic way, the dad did the same thing back. Quite frankly she didn\u2019t deserve the \u201cthe unprofessionalism\u2026\u201d because she wasn\u2019t just unprofessional, she was disrespectful and hurtful. I\u2019d 100% agree if she was only unprofessional, but she insulted the kid, and it\u2019s not the first time clearly.", "In most circumstances I would agree, it's generally better to rise above petty behaviour, but I think this is an exception. \n\nOP not only stood up for his son, but he did so in a way that showed directly to the headmistress how it feels to be bodyshamed. She clearly didn't like it, which may make her think twice about throwing around such comments in the future. A more professional response probably wouldn't have had the same effect. \n\nOP should explain to his son what you are saying - that in most circumstances it's not OK, and the son shouldn't follow this example.", "I\u2019d feel like I betrayed my kid if that was my answer, because you\u2019re not really standing up for your kid.", "You definitely do, it\u2019s a lesson for the kid too, respect someone until they don\u2019t respect you. Stand up for yourself, don\u2019t let people walk all over you. She body shamed the kid, she got body shamed back.", "Ooo okay. Good idea", "It is relevant because it's not actually you that the post is referring to so when people check they will see the discrepancies between your previous posts and this post and think it's a fake post. \n\nA simple \"A friend asked me to post this\" or \"This is posted on the behalf of someone else\" at the start would have sufficed. \n\nBut given your comments that you are friends with the chairman of the board of governors and that you're on hold with him now makes you somewhat less believable.\n\nIf your neighbour really is using your phone. Best practise will be to create a new account for him or at the very least clearly state that someone else is using this account.\n\nFair play though it's a good story and I eagerly await the update where Dolores Umbridge gets publicly fired by the chairman of the board and all is right in the world.", "I'm not changing the story at all, you just think that insults are okay if they are a retaliation and I do not. I think insults are never okay, especially around kids who do not understand the nuance that Dad's insult was \"okay\" not just because it was unprofessional (where in your own words you agree it would not be okay) but also because she was disrespectful and hurtful. 8 year olds do not have that level of emotional awareness or social intelligence.", "The son is 8. Do you think he has the emotional intelligence to distinguish between when a teacher makes him feel bad and it is okay to insult them vs when a teacher makes him feel bad and it isn't ? Do you think that a conversation at home about this is more valuable than embodying that with your actions?", "I get the impulse. I raised two girls and that instinct to papa bear is strong. \n\nWhat kept me in check was Mrs Shaman reminding me it's winning the war, not the battle. And that means not only beating Mrs Trunchbull but also teaching your kids the right lessons about higher ground and using the system.\n\nIt's eventually more satisfying watching the bullies lose and your kids learning how to do it unscathed in the retaliation.", "There, I've put \"posted on someone elses behalf\" at the top of the post", "I agree not to deliberately teach kids that it\u2019s okay to insult others, especially when there is no motive for it. But it\u2019s the same logic as if someone punches you, you punch back, don\u2019t stand there and take it. And I think it 100% makes sense. I hope the dad took time to take a talk with the kids to tell him that it\u2019s never ok to just insult others like that, but always to stand up to for yourself.\nI\u2019m not saying that \u201coh yes go teach your kids to be assholes and horrible people\u201d but I\u2019m saying to not raise a kid that won\u2019t stand up for him/herself.", "If the son were 8 then I'd agree, but the son is 14 (first line of the OP), which I think is old enough to understand at least some of the nuance.", "I\u2019m not a parent, I don\u2019t have as much experience as you. You probably know better, but that\u2019s just how I see it. I wouldn\u2019t want to walk out of there with my kid feeling down because he got insulted and my response was \u201cThis conversation is over, I\u2019ll be talking to someone more professional\u201d.", "Punching back can be self protection. It is not self protection to insult someone back. They are not the same and you are teaching a kid to take the low road. That's your prerogative I guess, but I'll be teaching my kids to be kind. Someone lowering themselves to insults is not justification for throwing away my own ethics/morals, because they are not situational. You should not need a flow chart to determine which situations you should stick to them, and when you can conveniently disregard them.", "lol where the fuck did I get 8 from \ud83d\ude02", "I will for sure be teaching my kids to be kind, I will by no mean be raising disrespectful kids, but I\u2019m also going to be teaching my kids that not everyone deserves their kindness and respect, because that\u2019s the truth."]}
