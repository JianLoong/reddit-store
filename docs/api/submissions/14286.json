The newest roommate is a somewhat mean and demanding person. She moved in 3 months ago and ever since then has been consistently screaming at her husband at all hours of the night in addition to texting and calling me in regards to anything going wrong on her side of the house (despite me not being a landlord, we actually have a landlord who lives very close to us that takes care of anything and everything.)\n\nIt got the point that the calls became more and more frequent. I rarely answered them after awhile when I noticed they were legitimate questions that needed to be addressed to a landlord. I even told roommate to avoid being rude how I work full time and that comment didn't matter.\n\nLast week, newest roommate began to complain about the ac unit being set too low for her comfort and how it was affecting her overall nights sleep. I was sent a very rude and aggressive paragraph long text message stating that she was going to have to tell the landlord about the issue because it was \"getting ridiculous\". Forget the fact that me and the other roommate were only told something about the ac unit once from her. Regardless, we turned the unit off and assured her it wouldn't happen again.\n\nAnd then just yesterday I get a text message from my landlord while at work telling me that newest roommate is frustrated because \"I blocked her\" and that her Amazon package was missing. When I texted to her to let her know that she wasn't blocked and had no clue where her package was due to being at work, I was met with \"well not like it matters anyways now when I was texting and calling all night\". Which bothered me because even my other roommate knows that while I\u2019m sleeping and while on the clock, I will always put my phone on do not disturb mode to avoid being bothered and just to have an overall peace of mind during those times .I was also told I had been acting funny so the amazon package missing was even more sketch because of that somehow. Then I also got told \"seems like y'all are the problem because your mad that I complained about the ac unit.\" To which I said \"this really is a one sided fight at this point. And if you're going to create problems out of nowhere then we don't need to speak anymore.\" And after all of that unnecessary drama, the amazon package ended up being on the side of the house out of plain view.\n\nI've just grown beyond annoyed with new roommate thinking she can use my personal line as a complaint center and be an ass to me when I've done nothing wrong.

You set the boundary and if she doesn\u2019t respect it, it\u2019s on her.

That she's been disturbing your sleep by texting at all hours as well.\n\nI wouldn't normally suggest telling a landlord so much but she's already complained and suggested you stole her amazon package. You need to tell the landlord your side of things because she's already talking to the landlord about you and could tell them worse things", "NTA. She honestly sounds like she has a mental illness. That doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior, just maintain the boundary that you\u2019ve already established and just be consistent with it.

Not to me, but towards a previous roommate who moved out in February. New, crazy roommate accused her of stealing shoes from her section of the house. And mind you, something I didn\u2019t include in the original post is how her and her husband aren\u2019t even in the same space as us, they both sleep in the converted garage right next to the entire house, which is separated from the 3 rooms that me and my main roommates occupy. The only things connected to the garage is the plumbing and the thermostat. So at this point, she\u2019s jumping to conclusions towards people she doesn\u2019t even physically see or interact with on a daily basis. Making it even more annoying for me", "this was my first thought when all of this started\u2026like why in the hell was she expecting me to be the personal housekeeper just because I was the only roommate that was talking to her. Made no sense to me.", "I let the landlord know how she confided in me a month ago that she was a convincted felon on probation, and how that\u2019s always going to be a concern of mine. I agree with you though, an intolerable child is what I\u2019ve been dealing with.", "Thank you for your feedback\ud83d\ude0a thankfully, I\u2019ve been documenting everything weird she\u2019s been doing since she moved in. Including her screaming sessions outside of the house towards her husband. I showed the landlord and she was somewhat concerned, but ultimately said if there were any other problems to give her a call. (That\u2019s another slight issue in this, is that the landlord can be overly passive towards the household issues.)", "I\u2019ve thought several times she might be manic bipolar because I\u2019ve had a roommate in the past, who was very open about being bipolar, and who also acted very similar to that. And I even told my landlord yesterday that I didn\u2019t want to text her letting her know she wasn\u2019t blocked (it was landlords idea) because I knew I\u2019d be met with an attitude.", "At this point, yes. She\u2019s already accused me of it anyways, shoot", "Her past doesn't matter. Her current behaviour matters.", "NTA - at all. \n\nTo be clear, you don\u2019t owe her communication, especially via text. If she needs to communicate about something that is legitimately concerning you, she can leave a message on the fridge.\n\nAnd you should tell the landlord you aren\u2019t interested in having further conversations with her, nor is it your problem to try and \u201ccalm her down\u201d\n\nFinally - find a new place to move, or tell the landlord it\u2019s you or her.", "Uh, no, her criminal record absolutely matters.", "Came here to say this. Add it with her unpredictability in moods, and sounds like you\u2019ve got a recipe for disaster", "Lowkey feeling like her criminal record is the cherry on top of all the other problems she\u2019s put out there. Smh", "NTA", "First, NTA. But info? Why can\u2019t she call the landlord herself? Even the landlord reached out to you instead of her directly. Who had her move in? Does the husband live with you too? Is she on the lease? \n\nIf you are not subletting to her, then you have ever right to block her.", "INFO why does she think that *you're* the point person? Sounds like she is specifically putting everything on you", "NTA \n\nTime to stick to your word and just not talk to her unless it\u2019s an absolute emergency, go ahead and block her while you\u2019re at it. There\u2019s absolutely no reason she should be reaching out to you about those issues anyways when she has the landlords information. If it\u2019s actually an emergency I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll leave a note out or ask in person.", "NTA but does she live with her husband? I ask because he's not listed as a roommate, but you said she was yelling at him. She sounds like a bitter little pill", "OP please (!) start keeping a log of the  things happening, and when.  It is quite possible one of her complaints will be escalated; e.g., if she continues to claim that her items are missing, your landlord will call the police out of self-protection.  If you have dates, times and details of harassment, you will have an easier time of it.  NTA, good luck.", "I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because I was genuinely the only one in the house who was responding to her, trying to be nice with answering all of her questions. Even the other roommate didn\u2019t feel the need to respond to her every time or speak to her if it wasn\u2019t about anything of importance. Prior to establishing the boundaries, I didn\u2019t realize that she was ultimately taking advantage of someone trying to be accommodating aka me.", "If you have the \u201cpeaceful and quiet enjoyment\u201d clause in your lease, you may be able to argue that your landlord\u2019s inaction regarding the harassment you receive from another tenant is infringing on your peaceful enjoyment. Usually that clause applies to actions your landlord takes, but it\u2019s a little muddy here since it\u2019s actually your landlord\u2019s choice to inaction that is the problem.", "Let the landlord know that they can either keep the disruptive tenant or you and the rest of the tenants were going to move out even if it means breaking the lease. They might also find it difficult to get and retain other tenants. It's up to the landlord to find a solution.", "I plan to have a talk with landlord after Easter Sunday, being that she will be out of town all weekend. That being said, in one of my roommates rambling texts from yesterday she said she was going to be looking for a new place to live and that I \u201cdidn\u2019t have to worry anymore\u201d. I don\u2019t believe her, being that she herself said her status as a felon is going to make it harder for background checks to accept her as a tenant. So I\u2019m currently looking at new rooms and looking for another place in case it comes down to that. Ones with background checks this time lol", "NTA\n\nYour motto for her should now be \"Talk to the hand and call the landlord.\"", "TY! The thought of that had crossed my mind, her possibly going the authorities, yet thankfully out here where I\u2019m living (Georgia) you can get into major and I mean MAJOR trouble for filing false police reports. Which would essentially be what new roommate would be doing, if she did decide to escalate anything. Just hoping it doesn\u2019t come down to that.", "Yes, husband is another roommate. I legitimately do forget that he is sometimes though, being that we never see or hear from him. Even when she\u2019s screaming down his neck. More often than not, he will just leave in his car most nights and be gone all night. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s to avoid living with the deplorable human being that he calls a wife.", "Honestly, I would have a conversation with the landlord and show her communications to you and then explain that you are blocking her messages due to the harassing nature of them. And do so after telling her that she\u2019s abused the right to have your contact information. If she needs to reach you, let her go through the landlord who can reach out to you.", "Agreed!  I am just worried that your LANDLORD will call the cops, because of roommate\u2019s accusations\u2026", "Ahhhh! I understand what you mean now, and I mentioned in another comment that landlord is pretty passive with issues in the household unless it involves her directly or something\u2019s broken lol. I know this because I\u2019ve had her as a landlord for a full year now. I at least trust and have seen, that she talks things out with us as she\u2019s a pretty rational, communicative person.", "I hope that you have a lock on your room and use it in the interim!"]}
