She may or may not have ADHD, but I will give some advice that would help with ADHD. The necklace in the shower drain probably came undone during the shower and she forgot she was wearing it.

Simple solution, either you can use stuff you already have or 5 $ at the dollarstore.\n\nAs for buying another ring: if she works, she should buy her own. Even if I am right and she has ADHD, that doesn't mean to not deal with her own shit.

Make sure she can \"view\" or \"track\" the account online.\n\nThen, have her decide what ring she wants, and also have her make the purchase herself.  She can even decide when she is ready to buy relative to the sum accumulating in the account.  And certainly she can change her mind to and fro as the process unfolds.\n\nYour theme is that you wish to empower her to replace the ring in the way she sees fit for herself.\n\nIf she complains that the above is not gift-ey or romantic, add that when she acquires the new ring, be sure to let you know, and you will take her out on a small outing to \"bless\" the ring and imbue it with the love and grace of your union.", "Kinda  an asshole, yes it's her fault for losing it but a lot of women take off their rings to wash hands, do dishes, etc, here is a possible compromise that may help to lessen the blow but still fix the underlying issue because you don't want her to think she isn't aloud to have things that she likes just because she can be careless I'm sure there are a lot of careless things you've done before. Get a replacement ring AND a silicone groove ring, the nicer ring is for when she wants to dress up or go out somewhere special and it stays in a jewelry box otherwise and the silicone groove ring is for everyday wear it's durable and waterproof and she won't need to take it off and why I specifically mention groove is because I have one and they will replace the ring for free no matter what, even if damaged or lost, other companies may do this too but I'm not sure", "I think if she wants a ring, she can just buy one herself.

She's obviously embarrassed about this and she wants a replacement of the symbol of your love and commitment - you're refusing because you want to punish her like she's a child because she lost two (2) pieces of jewelry in all the years you've known her. It's honestly weird to me that she has to *ask if she's allowed* to have a replacement - it should be a given. Its her wedding ring!\n\nI get why you might not want to buy a particularly expensive replacement, or why you might ask to buy a cheaper \"everyday\" ring and a more pricey one that she only takes out for special occasions. But you're just being mean on purpose. Like, have you never lost or misplaced something you \"valued\"? Not to mention that jewelry can be very fiddly and easy to lose (earrings fall out if the backings are loose, clasps break, pieces can be delicate and small, etc). \n\nHonestly, you have a valid reason to be annoyed and mad.

I lost an opal ring eight months ago and I\u2019ve literally cried over it. It was beautiful and sentimental, but at some point I accepted the things you love may get lost or damaged and that\u2019s a part of life.\n\nEdit: vote changed from everybody sucks bc OP clearly wants to place unnecessary blame, or purposely misdirect information like, she has never done the stupid dishes", "Gentle YTA from me on this one. I am way worse than your wife- I'm on my 4th wedding ring. First one was tension set, and broke. Second and third were lost. I am a disorganized wrecking ball tbh.

He was definitely (and with good reason) frustrated with me each time i lost them. He knew I was upset over it and that it was accidental each time, so he comforted me and saved a talk about his irritation until a few hours later, when eveeything had calmed down.\n\nImportant: does your wife have her own income source apart from you/your earnings?

That means her jewelry needs to be within a low price range, or that you both agree that you\u2019ll help her monitor expensive items. \n\nBerating and punishing doesn\u2019t work.
