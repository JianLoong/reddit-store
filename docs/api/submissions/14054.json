She may or may not have ADHD, but I will give some advice that would help with ADHD. The necklace in the shower drain probably came undone during the shower and she forgot she was wearing it. I, myself, have a necklace (I bought this one myself) that fell behind the dresser a few months ago when I got undressed in the dark and I have been putting off moving the dresser to look for it.\n\nShe likes to take off her ring at the sink and she only thinks of taking it off at the sink? Put a jar by each of these sinks for her to put it into. Simple solution, either you can use stuff you already have or 5 $ at the dollarstore.\n\nAs for buying another ring: if she works, she should buy her own. Even if I am right and she has ADHD, that doesn't mean to not deal with her own shit. If she's a stay-at-home mom, you guys should sit down and look at the budget and see how reasonable it would be to buy her a new ring in X time frame.", "> My wife had a tendency to leave her wedding ring in very strange places, on our second bathrooms sink, the kitchen counter, a shelf next to the kitchen sink.\n\nThese are not strange places. Do you never wash your hands?\n\nThis isn\u2019t about the ring as a piece of jewelry but as a symbol. If you are okay with flushing your marriage to make a point, be my guest.

Make sure she can \"view\" or \"track\" the account online.\n\nThen, have her decide what ring she wants, and also have her make the purchase herself.  She can even decide when she is ready to buy relative to the sum accumulating in the account.  And certainly she can change her mind to and fro as the process unfolds.\n\nYour theme is that you wish to empower her to replace the ring in the way she sees fit for herself.\n\nIf she complains that the above is not gift-ey or romantic, add that when she acquires the new ring, be sure to let you know, and you will take her out on a small outing to \"bless\" the ring and imbue it with the love and grace of your union.", "Kinda  an asshole, yes it's her fault for losing it but a lot of women take off their rings to wash hands, do dishes, etc, here is a possible compromise that may help to lessen the blow but still fix the underlying issue because you don't want her to think she isn't aloud to have things that she likes just because she can be careless I'm sure there are a lot of careless things you've done before. Get a replacement ring AND a silicone groove ring, the nicer ring is for when she wants to dress up or go out somewhere special and it stays in a jewelry box otherwise and the silicone groove ring is for everyday wear it's durable and waterproof and she won't need to take it off and why I specifically mention groove is because I have one and they will replace the ring for free no matter what, even if damaged or lost, other companies may do this too but I'm not sure", "I think if she wants a ring, she can just buy one herself.

She's obviously embarrassed about this and she wants a replacement of the symbol of your love and commitment - you're refusing because you want to punish her like she's a child because she lost two (2) pieces of jewelry in all the years you've known her. It's honestly weird to me that she has to *ask if she's allowed* to have a replacement - it should be a given. Its her wedding ring!\n\nI get why you might not want to buy a particularly expensive replacement, or why you might ask to buy a cheaper \"everyday\" ring and a more pricey one that she only takes out for special occasions. But you're just being mean on purpose. Like, have you never lost or misplaced something you \"valued\"? Not to mention that jewelry can be very fiddly and easy to lose (earrings fall out if the backings are loose, clasps break, pieces can be delicate and small, etc). \n\nHonestly, you have a valid reason to be annoyed and mad.

It\u2019s so easy to say this but the items you cherish the most are the ones always active in your life and the most likely to get damaged or lost. I lost an opal ring eight months ago and I\u2019ve literally cried over it. It was beautiful and sentimental, but at some point I accepted the things you love may get lost or damaged and that\u2019s a part of life.\n\nEdit: vote changed from everybody sucks bc OP clearly wants to place unnecessary blame, or purposely misdirect information like, she has never done the stupid dishes", "Gentle YTA from me on this one. I am way worse than your wife- I'm on my 4th wedding ring. First one was tension set, and broke. Second and third were lost. I am a disorganized wrecking ball tbh. My husband still replaced 3 out of the 4 rings himself, insisting on it- because he FORGAVE me for wrecking or losing them. He was definitely (and with good reason) frustrated with me each time i lost them. He knew I was upset over it and that it was accidental each time, so he comforted me and saved a talk about his irritation until a few hours later, when eveeything had calmed down.\n\nImportant: does your wife have her own income source apart from you/your earnings?

That means her jewelry needs to be within a low price range, or that you both agree that you\u2019ll help her monitor expensive items. \n\nBerating and punishing doesn\u2019t work.

I get the sense that you\u2019re hurt she lost it, and that\u2019s valid and okay, but by the tone of your post and the decisions you\u2019ve reported making, it seems you\u2019re taking it out on her in a really negative way. That makes you TA. I\u2019m also basing my vote on the fact that you view her losing the ring as evidence of her not caring about the ring, but in my opinion the evidence you\u2019ve presented clearly doesn\u2019t support that conclusion.\n\nWhat I see is that your wife told you she waited to inform you about the loss because she was emotionally upset over it (she chose avoidance, which isn\u2019t the best strategy when confronted with a problem, but it\u2019s certainly not indicative of not caring about it)! and she was trying both to deal with that distress and hoping the ring would turn up soon. It seems like she was also concerned about your reaction\u2026 and further that she was right to be. She tore the house apart, and while I\u2019m glad you helped her, that\u2019s what a good partner would do as the bare minimum and not an example of you going above and beyond to work as a team and support her with something she clearly struggles with. It is further evidence of her valuing the jewelry, though. \n\nYou\u2019re also TA because you noticed something your partner was really having a hard time with - keeping track of jewelry that was important to her- and instead of attempting together to find workable solutions (workable for her, not just solutions you think *should* work), you just told her to do it your way or figure it out, or suffer the consequences. That\u2019s your right to do so, but damn, it\u2019s not very supportive. When she failed, you berated her by accusing her of not caring about something she told you she cared about because she didn\u2019t adopt your methods and your suggestions didn\u2019t work for her, and you think you know best.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to try and diagnose people with a condition over one incident reported online, but I do think it\u2019s fair to point out that your wife\u2019s thought process, actions, and especially her response to this event are textbook symptoms of ADHD in women, and suggest that you both consider this as a possibility. Regardless of whether your wife has ADHD or just a re-occurring pattern of behaviour that is clearly indicative of significant struggles in this area, it\u2019s wild to me that you\u2019re unwilling to accept your wife\u2019s statement that she does, in fact, really care about her jewelry, and instead assume you know better than she does about how and what she\u2019s feeling. This is your life partner! Your co-parent! She\u2019s upset and struggling, and you\u2019re playing the \u201cI told you so\u201d game. A little compassion would go a long way here and no, that doesn\u2019t mean buying a new ring right now. It makes sense to wait to replace it until your wife figures out a better system that works for her to keep track of a ring. But it does mean acknowledging she does care, she\u2019s trying, she\u2019s struggling, and if the woman you married is struggling you ought to help instead of accusing her of not trying hard enough or not caring enough when she is telling you outright that she is trying, and she does care, and it\u2019s still not working.\n\nLike, practically speaking, either she\u2019s wrong, she\u2019s lying, or there\u2019s a different reason for her difficulties, such as the mental processing disorder for which she\u2019s showing *aggressive* signs, or something other, external reason to effort/desire.\n\nAsk yourself what makes the most sense, that she is delusional and only *thinks* she cares about and values her jewelry but actually doesn\u2019t, or that she\u2019s outright lying to you about caring about the symbol of your commitment to each other (if she is then you\u2019ve got WAY bigger problems in this marriage than a missing ring), or maybe there\u2019s a separate reason for her actions beyond lying or not caring, and that it\u2019s something you could research and support her with!\n\nIf you have time, jump on over to a few women-specific ADHD subreddits and view what\u2019s discussed there. Just to let you know, ADHD has no correlation with intelligence; it\u2019s a deficit in one\u2019s ability to regulate and direct their attention and their application of desires and motivation to actual behaviour. It\u2019s not that someone doesn\u2019t *know* stuff, it\u2019s that their brains don\u2019t make enough neurotransmitters to *do* stuff, despite knowing what ought or should be done. Talk about frustrating! Anyways, these subs aren\u2019t the right forums for you to post and ask questions, but they\u2019re great resources for gaining insight into something you may not be familiar with. I may be way off-base, but it can\u2019t hurt! If you look into it you can either discount my hypothesis or look into strategies to help her.

I don't think you should be replacing it for a long time.\n\nI was just wondering though, why does she continually take it off?  Just to wash dishes?  Wash her hands?  That's not reasonable, IMO.

I can understand being frustrated at a perceived lack of caring about a valuable item. But to unilaterally say \"no you're not ALLOWED another ring\" is a bit... infantilising? Controlling? These words sound too strong here but I'm not sure how else to describe it. They need to compromise. If my partner told me I wasn't allowed something because I'd lost it before, I'd be wondering why the hell they think they have the right to make the decision for me.

I can\u2019t put a tile on a wedding ring, but I think making an agreement that she can\u2019t wear it all the time and/or has to be intentional about putting it on and taking it off would be very reasonable.

I understand the frustration and the idea of \u201cwhy buy it again if she\u2019ll just lose it\u201d but sometimes it\u2019s something dramatic like this needed to make a change. I used to lose things all the time, 24/7, until I lost something very important to me. I couldn\u2019t replace it, in the end, but I did stop losing things frequently after that. Not because I lost it and couldn\u2019t replace it, but because I remember that awful and cold feeling in my stomach of it being gone and never to be found again. Sure, like every human every once in a while I do, but nothing that matters ever again. If I\u2019d had the chance to replace what I\u2019d lost, even if it took months or even a year or so, or longer, I\u2019d take that in a heartbeat and I wouldn\u2019t still spend days heartbroken about it. \n\nNot saying that she\u2019ll learn her lesson 100%, because I don\u2019t know her personally, but I do think sometimes giving people that one last chance after the worst happens, (as with anything in relationships, you don\u2019t \u201chave to\u201d) but a little grace can really make a difference in someone\u2019s life. Letting her prove she can change is something I\u2019d like to think we should all give our loved ones (to a certain extent of course, not if she lost the next one or continued the pattern over the months of \u201ctest run\u201d shall we say. Setting up some sort of long term fund over a couple years would be the way to go imo, or telling her she can replace it but only with her funds or some equivalent rather than straight up forbidding her from getting it again). Sometimes a habit is just that, a bad habit that can go away without having to make her sad for the entire rest of her life. Nobody is a flawless person that doesn\u2019t make the same mistakes ever in their lives because of bad habits, unless they are some super human or don\u2019t look at themselves truthfully. Do they need to fix that habit? Absolutely. We all need to grow and change as people.

It\u2019s still her fault for losing it and it\u2019s obviously a pattern she needs to address and fix because that\u2019s not how you can live as a healthy adult (with the same thing happening to the necklace), but I think that\u2019s why it took so long. I\u2019m not saying that she\u2019s right, or that you did anything to make her feel that way besides tell her to be more careful, OP, because I don\u2019t know you either and can\u2019t make that call (although many of your comments seem\nTo suggest you are angry about more than just the ring).

I was very afraid of losing my wedding rings and family rings (never wore rings before getting hitched) so I stocked up.  I take my rings off several times a day.  So far, so good.  \n\nMy uncle lost his wedding ring accidentally (slipped off finger as the fit was loose) 2 weeks after their wedding.  My aunt and uncle decided that the solution was that they would both buy inexpensive new rings when they would go to someplace memorable together.  I think it is a really nice way to still have all of the special memories still attached to rings  and the whole point is that rings get changed as new memories are made.", "What's the punishment??", "Exactly - thank you. My husband is on his second ring which he's had for many years now.  He lost the first custom designed ring on our honeymoon. Things happen. I love your idea of getting an inexpensive ring and looking at the replacement as  new chance to celebrate. The punishment vibe is disturbing.", "From what I\u2019ve seen from his comments and the edit she\u2019s lost it multiple times but this is the first time they haven\u2019t found it.

It just seems like this is a flex on both sides. I wish them luck.", "Yeah I was trying to figure this out. The OP says:\n\n>She asked if she could get a replacement ring.\n\nIt doesn't say she asked OP to buy her one, specifically. So the options are\n\n1. she did ask him to buy it for her specifically with his money and he doesn't want to (fair)\n2. she's a SAHM and he won't let her use \"his\" money to buy the ring\n3. they have joint funds and he won't let her use them for the ring\n\nIf it's option 1, NTA. If it's option 2, YTA... she should get the same amount of spending money that he gets, and she can use her money to save up for a new ring.

Compromise is the key word here and is what keeps a marriage happy and healthy.  A lot of contempt comes off this post and that\u2019s really the part that gets me.  It\u2019s expensive and it\u2019s frustrating (especially with it being a common problem), but contempt serves no purpose in a relationship other than to damage it.  \n\nI do recommend buying a few cheap \u201ccatch all\u201d bowls to put in the spots she likes to put the jewelry in too, though.  I have ADHD and there\u2019s no chance in hell I\u2019d remember to walk my shit over to the jewelry box and lock it in/take it out.

For me, a ring holder necklace would be an extra thing I would have to remember to put on in the morning whereas I \\*always\\* have my glasses on unless I'm laying down or sleeping so they're the more convenient option. If you only wear glasses occasionally (for reading, or driving) and often don't have those on hand, a ring holder necklace is better.", "I get how frustrating it is. I low key assume that continued carelessness is probably a sign of another issue. Not always ADHD.

My husband then took the drain apart when I told him what happened and was able to find it, and Im very thankful.\nIf that happened with my engagement ring, I would\u2019ve mentioned right away and at least tried to recover it.

Rings are sentimental and almost not at all utilitarian. It\u2019s proper to be generous with things that are sentimental luxuries when you can, but it\u2019s also proper to pick the replacement and save up, not use credit.

It's up to her to come up with a system for keeping track of it when she takes it off, if she values it.
