Taking out a loan and buying something worth that much money without talking to your spouse first is not acceptable on any front. A marriage is a partnership and he clearly left you out of a major financial decision and that's never okay. I'd find out what this is all really about cause mid-life crisis sounds about right here.", "NTA\n\nI'd be ensuring that my name wasn't on the title or on the loan, and I'd be peacing out of that marriage real quick.  This isn't an \"Whoops, I bought a $60 game without telling my wife\" kind of thing - That's $175,000.   You can buy several homes (albeit smaller ones) for that price.   That's a HUGE purchase to be making without involving your spouse.", "NTA. Assuming you have any kind of intermingling of finances whatsoever he should have discussed it with you. Especially if servicing this huge loan will negatively impact the family's finances. Even if you have plenty of discretionary spending money and no shared finances it's reasonable to expect a heads up.", "Come on, spending $173k on anything without consulting one\u2019s partner is a huge problem. Obviously NTA.", "NTA. \n\nAnd I hope it's only HIS name on that loan, and that him paying the bill doesn't impact YOUR finances.", "NTA oh lawdy yes, who the fuck does that? I mean I may make a $500 purchase without consulting the wife but that's on the edge of my comfort level but $173k???? fuck no", "NTA and it sounds like he has a place to live when you kick him out for being a huge idiot. \n\nI couldn\u2019t even imagine buying a $173k item without even a word to my spouse. Like what thought process leads anyone to think this is okay?", "NTA\n\nDefinitely screams mid life crisis but it can also tie into how he thinks he\u2019s going to spend his retirement. Either way that\u2019s a huge purchase and he didn\u2019t even think to include you when making that decision. \n\nI hope he\u2019s ready for owning one because it\u2019s a lot of work and maintenance. My uncle has one and it\u2019s an ongoing investment.", "NTA in any sense, that's a lot of money to be throwing about without at least a discussion", "Unless you guys are rolling in it and $173k is in line with your weekly spending \"fun\" money - NTA. That's insane.", "You can\u2019t possibly think you\u2019re TA here, I\u2019m so sorry you even had to ask. In a partnership, any large purchase (in mine, that\u2019s anything over $200) is a 1 no/2 yeses situation. Your husband has behaved disgracefully and you are NTA.", "Damn I'd be divorcing him. NTA", "NTA\n\nAnything over a set amount is a joint discussion in our household.  \n\nUnless turning up in an RV is a way for my partner to announce a really large lottery win to me I would be pissed.\n\nTaking a loan out for that amount would be serious trouble time whether it was him or me doing the spending.", "NTA, that said there is something much bigger going on and it appears from your own story the two of you aren't communicating. \n\nObviously, any major purchases should be agreed upon by both spouses, this really doesn't need to be explained. I would be more concerned with why did he do it and what is going on between the two of you or just one of you that drove him to it. No pun intended.", "NTA that's a big chunk of change to not discuss. Also to take out a loan and a hard inquiry on the credit score would have been an indication to talk with your partner.", "NTA. Expense aside, now you\u2019re going to have to go on RV trips to justify spending that money.", "NTA -  but try and find out exactly his through process for buying it.  Get someone to mediate if necessary", "NTA. That\u2019s a massive expense on a whim, and he shouldn\u2019t be sneaking around about it. Midlife crises happen but there\u2019s more productive ways to go about it. Even if he sells the thing he\u2019ll never make his money back on it.", "NTA\n\nWhat in the hell was he thinking?  $173K is enough for a **house** in some areas of the country.  And he didn't talk to you about it before making such a huge purchase?  \n\nYeah, this reeks of mid-life crisis.  Strange, the clich\u00e9 was he bought a sports car.   \n\nI'd seriously consider divorce if he does not cancel that order ASAP.   Not only is it a huge purchase made without even consulting you, but if he plans to use that RV, he's insisting on you uprooting your entire life for his amusement.\n\nAnd he should get into therapy because he clearly has some unresolved longing, maybe for travel, that he is trying to poorly express this way.", "NTA\n\nIf my husband bought anything over $150k without discussing it at all, I'd be booking a consultation with a divorce attorney.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like even logistics\u2026where do you put it?  You talk about work stress, so you\u2019re not rich and retired yet.   \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a one and done impulsive thing. He had to research, go look at, arrange for the loan etc.   long planned, to not discuss with your spouse.  \n\nGreat and suspicious at the same time he put it all in his own name.", "NTA. Something is going on in your husband\u2019s life that you need to pay more attention to. Unless you\u2019re very wealthy & $173k doesn\u2019t mean much in your budget, it\u2019s beyond imagining that a mentally healthy adult went out one day with no previous thought & spent that kind of money. He was thinking about this. He either didn\u2019t tell you or you didn\u2019t notice. Or he\u2019s experiencing mental changes that make him irrational. In any case, this purchase is probably not a one off. Does he contemplate selling your house & living in the RV? That is something that people with expensive RVs often do. The two of you need more serious talks about your life together.", "NTA, that's a huge financial purchase that should have been discussed.", "Nta if my husband spent that kind of money without consulting me he better have a head injury. Bc if not, his ass will be hearing from my attorney.", "NTA.\n\nHe had no right to make an investment of this size without your wholehearted agreement. And you would have been stupid to agree if he had asked you.\n\nFirst, I gather from your question that you and your husband are not wealthy, so you probably can't afford it.\n\nSecond, take the time to figure out how much you spend on vacations now, how much you can afford to spend on vacations, how much you would spend to go on a luxurious vacation at a hotel or resort every year, and how much you could spend if you wanted to rent an RV every year. I guarantee that this purchase is way more expensive than these other options.\n\nHe needs to cancel this purchase, or you need to divorce him.", "That is not an RV, that is a camper van. He bought a fucking camper van for $173K that he had to take out a loan on. Holy no. I would be freaked out to the max. That model isn't badly laid out but it's not worth what he paid for it. He could have purchased an actual RV and the (used) truck to pull it for the same or less. NTA.\n\nAs someone in my 40s, these are really something for people in their 20s. If you are in your 40s or 50s, you really need to have one custom built.", "NTA. I wouldn't even spend $173 without alerting my husband. (Not because I need his approval, but so he doesn't get blindsided and so that our finances don't get all muddled.) This was way out of line. If the purchase can be cancelled I would recommend doing so. And if he forged your signature to get the loan, that's a really big deal, and I'd honestly be considering calling the police about it.", "NTA. How is your response \u201ctalk to me next time?\u201d The only appropriate response is demanding he cancel the order and the loan. I would never accept that. He lied to you for months and put you at financial risk, and your response is, \u201ctry not to do this again\u201d?????", "Has he behaved in any other strange way? Forgetting things, personality changes, sex drive etc? Could be something medical.  Definitely Nta", "NTA because he bought an RV without your knowledge. So start with seeing the loan papers and making sure your name hasn't been forged. \n\nNext I would be looking at why he did this. From only your list of hobbies there wasn't anything that he was a part of. Has he been hinting that you and he are distant? Is buying an RV an over the top way to be closer to you? \n\nLong talks are needed, after you return the RV.", "Obvious NTA\n\nLike lmaoing at this one", "$173K without discussing it with you?  I'd be dumping that sorry arsehole!", "Outlier here\u2026 YTA. All your fun things are you and the girls, it seems.

He should Never have done with without you in the loop, but\u2026you don\u2019t seem to like spending time with him, so maybe a last ditch effort on his part?", "\n Th. U.one \nJon\n\nMum", "As he bought it without her knowledge, pretty sure she's not on the title or the loan", "It may not matter. If they are married she could be just as liable for repayment as him. If he defaults, the loan company can will most likely go after their joint assets.", "Well, at least he has somewhere to live now...", "Two couples I know bought expensive RVs like that. Then they sold their houses & hit the road. Maybe next time OP goes to lunch, she\u2019ll come home to a \u201csold\u201d sign in her front yard.", "I doubt it because it's a camper van. Obviously people do live in them but that one is not really set up to live in full time and it's better suited to younger people. This was clearly some internet thing he saw and got into.", "My brothers ex wife did this kind of thing all the time and just forged his signature, so it could very well be on the title if he decided to forge her signature.", "It\u2019s a secured loan. If he defaults, the loan company will take the RV. Maybe not the worst outcome.", "As long as the RV is worth the same or more than is owed.  Otherwise, they can put a lean on your assets until the balance is paid."]}
