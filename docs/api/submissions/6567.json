YTA. Did you also tell her to \"calm down\". I heard that helps. /s\n\nPro tip: invalidating people's feelings (\"your overreacting\") pretty much never makes them feel better or like you more. It's like how calling people ugly or punching them in the face dosen't make them more inclined towards you. It's super basic social knowledge.\n\nTo recap you told your wife wanted to do x at your wedding, she said she didn't like that and it would make her feel bad. You told her she was wrong and she would like it. Then you did it. She told you she didn't like it and made her feel bad. You told her her feelings were wrong and she shouldn't get to be upset or dislike things. That's what your saying when you tell someone they are overreacting. That their feelings are wrong for not being what you think they should be, and they need to change their feelings/get rid of them. This never works. \n\nIf you ever want to actually calm someone down you *validate* their feelings so they feel heard and understand. Beacuse what you did is send your wife the very clear message you don't care that feels hurt and embarrassed plus she's dumb for feeling that way. Instead, *even if you disagree,* start by listening to her feelings, empathizing, and validating them. You don't have to say they were right if you don't want to. Then, after they feel heard, understood, and cared about they will be much more likely to forgive, calm down, or see your point of view. They'll be more receptive. \n\nAdmittedly, the silent treatment isn't a great way to handle communication in a relationship. But also, why should your wife talk to you if your just going to tell her her feelings are stupid and you don't care? When she told you she was hurt, you made her feel *worse.* So yeah, talking to you just sort of sucks, dosen't it?", "YTA\n\nI think it's a tasteless joke.", "YTA.

Ignoring your wife's wishes on your wedding day is definitely an AH move. I hope the brief chuckle from the audience was worth ruining your wedding over, at least for her.", "YTA - but now the only way to make it up to her is to forever be the one who does the dishes.

It's not on her to do the dishes, she didn't include that in her vows.", "YTA. She told you no, you did it anyway. Your most heartfelt, solemn moment w her and you made a sexist housework joke that no wife would think is funny.

Women regularly feel like maids in their own homes and do divorce lazy entitled men who think the dishes (let alone every other domestic duty) is the wife\u2019s problem bc she was cursed w a vagina.

It's only okay if you're both okay with it, and you knew in advance that she wouldnt be okay with it.
