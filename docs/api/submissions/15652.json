She knows that I have to take care of her brother but stills calls me up all the time and asks me to go with her to appointments and such. I told her several times that I can't unless its a emergency since Dwight gets severe anxiety in hospitals and I can't leave him alone. She still gets upset because she thinks I could just leave him with his nurse for a couple hours. I think that the pregnancy hormones may be affecting her too much and she wants to \"fight\" for her mom's attention. It would be ok if it wasn't because her brother needs special care. \n\nShe's gonna give birth soon and she asked me to go stay at her house for a bit before the birth and some weeks after the baby's born. I told her I can't do that, I would need to take Dwight with me and she won't be able to relax with him there (since he can be a bit of a troublemaker sometimes). She told me to leave him with his dad and nurse. I told her that she needs to understand that my priority is taking care of my son now, I have to be there for him. She argued that she's my daughter too and she needs me since she has no one else. I told her that's a lie because she has her husband, and I also said that maybe when her kid is born she'll understand that as a mom your first priority are your kids and even more if they have special needs and need you all the time, now she's an adult and doesn't need me, she's not my priority. She cried and insulted me. She said that she'll never be able to forget that I choose her brother over her again and during such a hard moment for her.

My youngest son is also neurodivergent but that doesn't mean I stopped loving my oldest son, and it doesn't change the fact that he still needs me too even though he's 18 now. When you have more than 1 child you don't get to pick favorites, you have to find a way to love them both equally no matter their ages or abilities.

Obviously, she means nothing to you as you have absolutely not a moment to spare for her at such a critical time in her life. I hope you are resigned to the fact that you will probably never see your grandchild.  They clearly don't mean anything to you either because the only person in the world that matters is your son. You are a prime example of the uncaring and selfish parent who feels that the \"normal\" child should just deal with life completely on their own and never bother them because the \"different\" child is entitled to absolutely every shred of energy, love, attention and money. You should have just let someone else adopt your daughter so she could have a real mother.

She's pregnant and wants support from you, her mother. You are showing her that she (and by extension, her unborn child/your grandchild) are less important than your son.

You are abandoning your daughter during a crucial part of her life and favoring your son over her. I get it, your son needs assistance. Maybe get a nurse or leave him with your husband?\n\nInstead of trying to compromise or come up with a solution, you place your daughter on the backburner. You expect her to toe the line and not get upset when you are effectively telling her \"your brother has always been and will always be more important than you\". Participating in a family requires work, which you have failed to complete. Don't be surprised when you never see the grandchild.\n\nEDIT: Allow me to communicate to you 100% in case you read this: I think you are a bad mother. Don't read any of this with gentleness or encouragement. I think you are failing your son and daughter. It sounds like you have made your son fully dependent on you alone rather than medical professionals, and you have neglected your daughter emotionally.", "YTA -  You will grow old with Dwight.

Out of curiosity, what are your plans for Dwight when you are too old to care for him.?", "YTA\n\nYour daughter will never need you more than she does right now, and you are failing her by not showing up. Your son has two other caregivers (his dad and a nurse) -- your daughter has no one else who can guide her into motherhood the way you can. \n\nIf you don't show up for her now (even in small ways), don't expect to be at all involved in her life or your grandchild's life moving forward.", "YTA  Are you serious?

I hope you're proud of yourself. YTA", "Absolutely 100% YTA. As someone who myself came from a family where my mother put all her attention on my little brother once he was born because of him being neurodivergent, I know how much it hurts to be neglected by a parent. And that is what you are doing. Yes, your daughter has her husband, but sometimes, she just needs her mum. How could you be so heartless as to deny her that? She is your child and deserves your attention too. Is she not entitled to a bit of your attention? She is going to have her *first baby*. No doubt she is scared because she's never done it before. Have you forgotten what that felt like for you? The fear of your first baby, because your body has never done that before, you don't know if you're cut out for parenting, and you're worried that you might screw up. \n\nRight now, she needs her mother, someone who she should be able to lean on. She needs you, because you've been where she is right now. *She* needs your support. Your son has his father. He doesn't \"need you\" 24/7. But, you really are choosing him over her. Just because she's an adult, doesn't mean she should be any less of a priority. No matter how old we get, we never stop needing our parents, even if it's just for some goddamn attention and support.

You have 2 children, not 1. There is a dad and caretaker in the picture for your son so it sounds like you are refusing to help your daughter for a reason that isn\u2019t actually true. Of course you can\u2019t go spend multiple weeks with your daughter, but what about an appointment here and there? A couple of hours? Can you really not leave your son with his caretaker, or is there something else that makes you believe that? What about respite care? You seem unwilling to even consider getting any help at all and that bothers me. \n\nYour daughter desperately wants and needs her mother right now. I\u2019m guessing you have had to refuse your daughter many, many times due to the needs of your son. What event of your daughter\u2019s is going to be big enough for you to participate if it isn\u2019t the birth of your grandchild? When will your daughter get to enjoy her mother?\n\nIt really sounds like you are refusing your daughter and refusing to consider any options, which is what makes you TA. I can guarantee it\u2019s absolutely is destroying your daughter that you won\u2019t even try. Your actions show your daughter that she has effectively lost her mother to her sibling, and that\u2019s going to be painful no matter what. It\u2019s not just pregnancy hormones, mom. It\u2019s grief. She is grieving the loss of her mother\u2019s support, the support she so desperately needs.", "YTA.

I hope you find a way to actually be a mom to your daughter, but if not when you complain that you never get to see your grandkid after the daughter cuts you out of her life.

While it makes perfect sense that there would be limits on your time, you have made the mistake of assuming that your son's needs dictate your daughter's needs. This isn't the case.

It may be that you have backed yourself in to a situation where there is no solution on the timeline of your daughter's pregnancy, but now would be a good time to begin making changes if you want to see any grandchildren. Or, you know, heal your relationship with your daughter. Who is also your child.  It sounds like you have a husband and paid help. You all need to figure out how the system can function without you at least some of the time so that you can do what is actually the bare minimum for your daughter. \n\nCan you offer her anything? Joining some things by video? An afternoon visit? The promise to help your son build up to being able to go a weekend with different support people?

I am his primary care giver.\n\nCristina got married and is pregnant now, I'm happy for her but the problem is she wants my attention all the time. She knows that I have to take care of her brother but stills calls me up all the time and asks me to go with her to appointments and such. I told her several times that I can't unless its a emergency since Dwight gets severe anxiety in hospitals and I can't leave him alone. She still gets upset because she thinks I could just leave him with his nurse for a couple hours. I think that the pregnancy hormones may be affecting her too much and she wants to \"fight\" for her mom's attention. It would be ok if it wasn't because her brother needs special care. \n\nShe's gonna give birth soon and she asked me to go stay at her house for a bit before the birth and some weeks after the baby's born. I told her I can't do that, I would need to take Dwight with me and she won't be able to relax with him there (since he can be a bit of a troublemaker sometimes). She told me to leave him with his dad and nurse. I told her that she needs to understand that my priority is taking care of my son now, I have to be there for him. She argued that she's my daughter too and she needs me since she has no one else. I told her that's a lie because she has her husband, and I also said that maybe when her kid is born she'll understand that as a mom your first priority are your kids and even more if they have special needs and need you all the time, now she's an adult and doesn't need me, she's not my priority.

Do you still want to be dressing him when he\u2019s a teenager? An adult? Do you still want to be having to supervise him constantly and be afraid to go out in public when he\u2019s that age because he has not learned any self-regulation skills?\u201d Usually the thought of having their child remain totally and unnecessarily dependent on them long term kicks the parents into gear and gets them working on having their kids learn some self-help skills and behaviour management instead of relying on their parents to do everything for them and expecting the world to revolve around them to avoid their meltdowns. \n\nI\u2019ve literally never had a parent straight up say, \u201cWell, yes, I want to keep him entirely dependent on me and be available to him constantly and indefinitely to meet his every need at the expense of having my own life and maintaining my own relationships with friends and family, and I don\u2019t really want him to have a life at all independent of me either.\u201d I\u2019ve been at this for over two decades and that\u2019s a level of codependency I\u2019ve never encountered. No matter the level of disability, *all* kids can learn to be more independent in some ways, no child should ever be in the position of needing their parent around 24/7, they need to learn to adapt to other settings and other people and live in the real world. \n\nOther people have done a good job of explaining why YTA because of how you\u2019re neglecting your daughter\u2019s needs, so let me focus on why YTA in regards to your son. Let me be frank. YOU\u2019RE BEHAVIOUR IS CRIPPLING YOUR SON. You should have been working with his school and therapists on this for *years* now instead of continuing to treat him like a dependent infant who only had you to rely on to meet all of his needs. The best time to work on encouraging independent skills is yesterday, the second best time is today. So get to work, because you are currently failing your son as surely as you\u2019re failing your daughter. \n\nI *know* what happens to kids like your son who are catered to for decades and never have anything really expected of them, they suddenly end up in crisis group homes or nursing homes when their parents age and can no longer take care of them. It\u2019s incredibly hard on the adult child, they\u2019re scared and they struggle to adjust because they\u2019ve never been expected to transition to doing anything independently or with help from anyone but mom. Sound familiar? \n\nSo, you *could* have a son that is capable of a life of his own with less support (and/or is able to get that support from a variety of people) and rebuild your relationships with everyone you\u2019ve been neglecting, and, you know, have your own life and allow your son to have his. Or, you and your son could both end up alone and scared, having alienated everyone else in your life at the alter of devoting your entire life unnecessarily to this cause and never having allowed him learn the skills he needs to be at all independent of you.

So, remember that when you need a ride to the doctor and she's too busy. You literally told her that she and your grandchild don't matter. Great job, Mom. Way to go! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "I be the daughter has been trying (and failing) to get her mother to participate in her life for the last 16 years in any way.", "Look, I agree that every child needs attention. However dealing and caring for a special needs child isn\u2019t the easiest thing in the world. \nObviously mom should go to some of her appointment and help her daughter out. I do think that asking her to move in is too much especially when you care for someone with special needs.", "I agree that it's a problem. I have seen a few comments here that implied there was something vaguely incestuous going on. That's not an uncommon accusation in situations like this and it's upsetting because usually the problem is very like what you said. The parent just can't let go and understand that, even if the kid always needs support, they still have to grow up. \n\nI see how people fall in to these situations when the pressure won't let up and their experience is of a foreshortened future. I don't think that makes the behavior acceptable.", "Why is OP not responding ? I feel like there could be a compromise here from her side.", "Both are important but he needs me more than she does, she has her husband and a lot of medical staff, I'm not needed there and I can't spend weeks at her house", "Hope she's not planning on the daughter taking care of the son. She's guaranteed that won't happen.", "Feels that way. She is not sick enough.\nEven pregnancy doesn\u2019t make her interesting to her mom", "Sounds like she has a nurse and a husband perfectly capable of watching him for a time. What's your next excuse? Do you use these same ones on your kids? Is that why you're trying so hard here thinking we will buy them?", "I\u2019m guessing she just doesn\u2019t want to leave her son overnight. \n\nI\u2019m sympathetic to OP, but without getting set up with proper outside care, and ensuring her husband is properly able to care for him, she\u2019s essentially chosen her son over her daughter. Sounds like the daughter has lived her entire life taking a backseat to her brother, and this is likely the last straw for her.\n\nOP-this may be a very pivotal moment in your life. If you care even a little bit about your daughter and your future grandchild, you will make this happen. You may not have any relationship with her after this, and I wouldn\u2019t blame her.", "Update will be \u201cWhy will my daughter not let me meet my grandchild?\u201d \nYTA", "You clearly are showing both are not important. How hard is it for you to realize YTA", "You want him to need you. The nurse will do just as good of a job if not better than you could do. Also - you have a husband. He should take care of your kid too. \n\nAlso - quick note - if your daughter says she needs you, maybe she does. You are writing her off like she isn't important and it is honestly fucking disgusting behavior.", "Jesus have you ever heard of a compromise before? You keep repeatedly saying in these comments that you can\u2019t spend weeks at her house, so\u2026 you\u2019re just not offering to spend any time with her at all? \n\nIt sounds like your daughter is quite literally desperate for support from her own mother, and you can\u2019t even give her a day on the weekend or something where you get your husband or Dwight\u2019s nurse (yes, he will live if you leave him for a few hours, I promise you that, even if it\u2019s with a person he\u2019s not the biggest fan of)", "Sounds like you can't be bothered to make any time for your daughter at all. Because your son MIGHT get upset. Hope your daughter learns you don't care about her.", "She has her husband and medical staff.\n\nYour son has his dad and medical staff.\n\nYou don't have to stay with her for weeks but you can't find any time? I'm guessing you haven't had time for her for about 16 years now.", "You aren't even bothering to go there for the birth", "Don't be surprised if she decides to never let you meet her kids.", "All I'm seeing is a load of excuses.  YTA.\nGive your daughter some of your time. You'll never get it back.", "She doesn\u2019t need you enough so you won\u2019t give her anything. \nAre you expecting to have any sort of relationship with your grandchild?", "She can die giving birth and you don't care.", "But you also can\u2019t spend ONE appointment with her?", "Ok so you\u2019ve clearly have your mind made up that you\u2019re not the AH. Why did you even ask?", "Here's the thing OP. \n\nYes, it is unreasonable in some respects to go and spend weeks with Cristina following the birth, I can understand that. \n\nBut you *can* establish some routine for Dwight with his nurse so that he can get used to someone else giving him care. \n\nThis way you can be there for Cristina in some ways and even give yourself a break here and there.\n\nBecause let's be really real here, if you don't figure out a way forward you're going to miss out getting to know your grandchild, having an adult relationship with your daughter **and** you're setting up Dwight to struggle when he may need to transition into a professional care environment. You won't be his carer forever.", "Didn\u2019t you also say he has a nurse who can stay with him?", "You ARE needed.  You could at least show up for a few hours while the kid is emerging.  Do you know how many grandparents would love that kind of opportunity?", "YTA.\nYou honestly sound like you don\u2019t want to take up any of the suggestions provided. What\u2019s the bet this isn\u2019t the first milestone of your daughter\u2019s you are choosing to miss for your son.", "SHE TOLD YOU YOU'RE NEEDED THERE.", "According to you. But actually actions speak louder than words and right now your actions are saying quite bothering me. I don\u2019t have time to deal with you or your child!", "Your son has a nurse and a father, why does HE need you? YTA.", "Right?! OP is going to act like the daughter is selfish for not letting her see the grandchild... Just wait \ud83d\ude44", "Go read ops comments daughter is from a previous marriage and son is from current marriage.\n\nGee I wonder why mother of the year would make the son a priority and not even try to find a way to help? Anyone want to take a guess?"]}
