Life long resentments in the making. Your money, don't owe the kid a car. Life is full of painful lessons, nothing wrong with offering 1/2, 5k, he can add to it or not. Entitled kids, crappy grandparents and a parent stuck with the dealing with the aftermath.", "YTA. You are running your relationship with your son over your personal feud with your parents.  You are trying to steal got sons gift from his grandparents. \n\nOn the surface I would say grandparents are AH also but\nI think you are leaving details out. Why are your parents favoring your 4th child? Is he closer to them? Spends more time with them? \n\nRegardless, you have a responsibility as a parent to be fair to all your children.", "ESH.  Your grandparents are very clearly favoring one grandchild.  Your son seems to think he's entitled to a $10k car when it's actually a gift, and you are trying to force your son to use his gift money in the way you see fit.  I see your point that you are trying to even things out, but having him spend his whole $5k is too far.  \n\n\nAlso, their analogy is bullshit.  People win scholarships through achievement, or at the very least, the effort it takes to find them and apply.  The only good reason to take money out of a college fund would be if the college (tuition, room, board and fees) is totally covered or the kid doesn't go to college and the money would be forfeited if you don't move it to another child.

It\u2019s not jack\u2019s fault that he is being preferred by the grandparents. Your grandparents are being biased and playing favorites which is wrong . You are ruining your relationship with your son due to your problems with your parents. You need to focus more on building a relationship with all your kids equally instead of this BS. Though Jack should understand that he has a lot which the other kids did not have but it\u2019s not his fault at all, you need to explain this to him like a good father.", "NTA My grandparents played absolute favorites. I didn't really care, I was way older than the goldenchild, and was just surprised it was possible for them to not suck. Turns out it was detrimental, not to get into it too much but they escalated the financial favoritism as golden child got older and they weren't mature or prepared to handle it. It accelerated their downfall and I still blame the grandparents. I don't know what they intended, but they alienated a good kid from their family, spoiled them, set them up and ruined them. \n\nMaybe you can put his money into a college fund, but it's definitely time to talk about responsible options for using unexpected windfalls incase this keeps happening.", "You don't have to be TA at all and you can still stand your ground, because cars cost way more now than they did a few years ago.

He\u2019s right that a present from someone else shouldn\u2019t change your commitment. You\u2019re going to give him less than you had to his siblings. The gift is from YOU, not your parents.

They created this situation with an extravagant gift they didn\u2019t give to the other children. They\u2019re entirely to blame. Explain to the other kids what happened. No need to shield your parents in this case. \n\nYour son isn\u2019t much at fault here, though even at 16 I would hope he would realize how fucked the situation is.

Just b/c the grandparents didn't give the other kids 5k doesn't mean you should try and level the field by making him put it towards the car he was expecting to receive.", "YTA.

So why should he spend his gift money to make things fair when it was his grandparents that made it unfair? You suggesting that he spend it on the car is ALSO unfair. I would apologize to your son and try to explain the situation, and ask him if he would consider at least spending some of the money.", "I'm gonna go ESH. Giving siblings differently valued gifts, especially major gifts like a car purchase sucks. But you undercutting your son makes you just as guilty as your parents. It's a hard conversation to have with someone that age, but I probably would have taken Jack aside and explained how unfair it was that his gift so exceeded his siblings, and suggested some kind of equitable solution, maybe an investment account where each sibling benefits equally, or just straight up splitting it to $1k each, but I can understand why a teenager would find that a difficult suggestion.\n\nYou parents suck because if they just liquidated some assets, they should have split it between the siblings evenly, obviously favouring one over the others to the tune of $5k is ridiculous.\n\nINFO: why is Jack the favourite child? Is he the only boy in the family? The only one following family trade or tradition? What's the underlying issue here?", "YTA it's really none of your other kids' business how much their grandparents gave Jack. Financial circumstances change and as they said they had more cash at the time. Why get upset? This is a teachable moment you can use to discuss crab mentality and you used it to stir up drama and also create more inequality by lowering your gift value.\n\nThe scholarship metaphor is spot on and your son is right and seems very mature with his response. You on the other hand are not and berating your parents for a gift is awful. Not everything in life is handed out equally. You're setting your kids up to be entitled AHs that think they deserve something just because someone else gets it.", "YTA.\n\nIf you feel the need to even things up between the children, you don't make thing even for your kids by taking something away from one. You even things up by providing more for the others.\n\nAt most, I would suggest having Jack set all but a couple hundred dollars aside for college or something.  He'd still have th same amount of spending money as his siblings, but would still benefit from the 5k.  And he wouldn't have 5k worth of *stuff* to rub in his siblings' faces.\n\nIts not fair that the grandparents favor Jack so much.

Jacks right, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. I mean, you don\u2019t owe him a car. That\u2019s your choice. But you are doing to him exactly what you\u2019re angry at your parents for doing to your other children. You\u2019ve managed to punish Jack for something he can\u2019t control (his grandparents behavior) and likely damaged your relationship with him by showing him that you don\u2019t value him the same way you value your older children.", "INFO: What does your wife say about the situation? All of your comments are strongly hinting at you being a mixed-race couple, and your parents are racist and are openly favoring the whitest grandchild available.

It\u2019s not his fault that his grandparents favor him so obviously. Other gifts he received should not affect his gift from you.  \n\nYou\u2019ve established a tradition in your family, which is that on their 16th birthday you buy them a modest car.  *You* buy it, not their grandparents.

You\u2019re taking this out on the wrong person ( though it does sound like you\u2019ve let your parents know very clearly that this was wrong, too).  \n\nYou can\u2019t make your older kids feel less slighted by trying to balance things financially.  You\u2019re a family that can afford cars as birthday gift, your kids are fine financially.  It\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about your parents making it clear they love Jack more.

If you contribute the same $10k you always have AND you get Jack to use a significant chuck of his $5k gift, he'll come away with, ballpark, as good of a car as everybody else got.", "Your parents suck because they are making the other kids feel bad, you suck for how you went about it with Jack. \n\nYou should just be honest with him about it, if he\u2019s old enough to get a car he\u2019s old enough to understand reality.
