We fought, and they called me an entitled brat, nothing new under the son.\n\nWhen we were getting ready to go look at cars, I told Jack to bring his check from his grandparents. He asked why, and I said because I would pay for half the car, and his grandparents were paying for the other half. Jack was upset because he thought the 5k was \"just for him\" and that I paid for the cars for all his older siblings in their entirety so I'm treating him unfairly. I pointed out they didn't get 5k from their grandparents, so it would even out. He said \"two wrongs don't make a right.\" I won't transcribe the entire argument, but he was extremely upset and said I ruined his birthday and now he isn't sure if he even wants a car, to which I said that's fine and if he changes his mind he can let me know.\n\nHe also called my parents, who rang me and called me an asshole for trying to \"steal\" their gift. We had a pretty intense fight, where I said some things one probably shouldn't say to one's parents. They said depriving one son to try and keep everything even between all kids is cruel and neurotic. They asked if I would take money out of their college funds if they got scholarships. I said that wasn't remotely the same and they called me a hypocrite.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the feedback everyone. I was trying to make things easier for myself, and that was wrong. I talked to Jack about why it was wrong for his grandparents to give him that check and why it was wrong for him to accept it. We voided it and sent it back, and I gave him $300.

OP spent 10 grand each on cars for the others how is forcing this singled one out to pay half saving him???", "Hi OP, this comes from someone with a racist grandma\u2026 how do you think your other kids feel? I can tell you: unloved, uncared for, discriminated and like literally life as a white person is better cause your whites brother gets thousands of dollars when you get a hundred.\nIs that the life you want your kids to have!?? Or grow up thinking it\u2019s normal that the people that supposedly love you treat you like that? Sigh", "So you have allowed it for 20 years\u2026 you are racist too!", "Yes, I'm sure that stopped your kids from noticing the blatant, skin-color based treatment.", "YTA, you're trying to level the playing field and in doing so you are treating your children differently.\n\nIf I was him, I would consider moving out of your place and in with the grandparents.\n\n>He also called my parents, who rang me and called me an asshole for ***trying to \"steal\" their gift.***\n\nThey're right, you tried to co-op their gift to make thing even, and like your son said, two wrong don't make a right.\n\n> I talked to Jack about why it was wrong for his grandparents to give him that check and why it was wrong for him to accept it. We voided it and sent it back, and I gave him $300. I'll pay for the car in its entirety.\n\nAnd your AH-ishness only grows, that his money your AH.", "Yta 100. \n\nU don't like that fact ur parents treat ur kids diffrent so u treat u kids diffrent.\n\nAll the \" resentment\" ur trying to avoid will now be directed at ur.\n\nSo ur parents are racist and instead of either standing up to them or cutting them off u act like a coward and go after ur son?!?! Even more ur the asshole", "Hold on. It isn\u2019t Jacks fault that your parents prefer him over the others and he shouldn\u2019t have had to give them money back. Likewise, YTA bc you were punishing your son and forcing him to pay for something you did not make his siblings do which ACTUALLY means, you\u2019re just like the grandparents.", "Your parents don\u2019t like your child and you still keep in contact with them?  I hope this conversation thread is a wake up call for you.", "JFC, dude.  Why do you let your racist parents go anywhere near your mixed race kids?  When are you gonna grow a spine and cut them off?", "Way to make your kid hate you AH", "OP, the world doesn't wait to put that shit on kids' shoulders. Kids aren't stupid, and I guarantee you most or all of your kids are aware of race on some level. Arm them with education and support before they face the ugly world.", "I\u2019d like to read your story!", "It\u2019s Also hard to start with a fresh slate when your white-passing brother gets five grand and you didn\u2019t. That builds resentment with all the other kids too. Honestly in this scenario, somebody is going to lose and it\u2019s a tricky one to navigate."]}
