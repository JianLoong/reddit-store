He asked why, and I said because I would pay for half the car, and his grandparents were paying for the other half.

I didn't really care, I was way older than the goldenchild, and was just surprised it was possible for them to not suck. Turns out it was detrimental, not to get into it too much but they escalated the financial favoritism as golden child got older and they weren't mature or prepared to handle it. It accelerated their downfall and I still blame the grandparents. I don't know what they intended, but they alienated a good kid from their family, spoiled them, set them up and ruined them. \n\nMaybe you can put his money into a college fund, but it's definitely time to talk about responsible options for using unexpected windfalls incase this keeps happening.", "You don't have to be TA at all and you can still stand your ground, because cars cost way more now than they did a few years ago.

Giving siblings differently valued gifts, especially major gifts like a car purchase sucks. But you undercutting your son makes you just as guilty as your parents. It's a hard conversation to have with someone that age, but I probably would have taken Jack aside and explained how unfair it was that his gift so exceeded his siblings, and suggested some kind of equitable solution, maybe an investment account where each sibling benefits equally, or just straight up splitting it to $1k each, but I can understand why a teenager would find that a difficult suggestion.\n\nYou parents suck because if they just liquidated some assets, they should have split it between the siblings evenly, obviously favouring one over the others to the tune of $5k is ridiculous.\n\nINFO: why is Jack the favourite child?

This is a teachable moment you can use to discuss crab mentality and you used it to stir up drama and also create more inequality by lowering your gift value.\n\nThe scholarship metaphor is spot on and your son is right and seems very mature with his response.
