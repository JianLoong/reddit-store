My niece also has some special needs that we weren\u2019t told about. We\u2019re still trying to figure out potty training, she has sensory and motor issues, and she has speech delays. All of this has made us, especially my husband, unsure of whether we\u2019ll adopt her or not. \n\nOur house needed some work that required us to stay in a hotel for 2 weeks. We decided to take the opportunity to go on a 2 week vacation. This is the first trip we\u2019ve taken my niece on. Her parents don\u2019t let us take her out of state and we tend to use our other kids out of state games/competitions as vacations. \n\nNiece was very excited for this trip, then on the 2nd night she had a fever and started vomiting. I\u2019ve been having my husband go out with the kids and I\u2019ve been staying at the rental with my niece. \n\nWe\u2019re on day 6 and niece is still not feeling great we\u2019ve been taking her out a little but she and I leave early. My husband wants to take the kids to a national park but my niece isn\u2019t well enough for all of the walking and hiking. He wants me to come and see if the neighbor\u2019s teen daughter can babysit (we\u2019ve been getting along well with the family and the kids have gone out together so niece does know them) but I think niece would be even more devastated if we all go and leave her with a babysitter. I\u2019m also not too comfortable leaving her with someone we\u2019ve known for 6 days. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m putting my niece above the kids but I think while niece is under our care she needs to be treated as an equal and we wouldn\u2019t do that with one of our kids. He\u2019s saying that\u2019s not true but we\u2019ve never done it with our kids and I can\u2019t see him suggesting that for them. \n\nWe can\u2019t come to an agreement on this so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1686422909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1467vjt/aita_for_not_getting_my_niece_a_random_babysitter/", "score": 135, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do her biological parents have *any* say over the trips she's taken on? If she's up for adoption it means they failed and get zero say.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband doesn't want to deal with your niece.\n\nThe kid should probably see a doctor if she is still that sick after several days.", "NTA\n\nA special needs kid who is also seriously sick... It's so  very unlikely you  could find anyone qualified to deal with this situation on  short notice.  Your husband is delusional.", "NTA\n\nYou're behaving in a very responsible way toward your niece. Your husband? Not so much. Please, sit down with him and have a long, serious conversation about adoption. You two don't seem to be on the same page.", "Info: did you take her to the doctor yet? A fever and vomiting makes me think strep as a school nurse. Until you have ruled out what she has is not contagious you shouldn\u2019t be having someone else stay with her.", "NTA. He\u2019s probably going to always treat her differently than his own kids and it makes me wonder if adopting her would be best for her.", "NTA. she needs to feel equally as loved and part of the family as the other kids. If your husband disagrees, I worry he won\u2019t be a great adoptive parent\u2026", "If this is headed towards adoption then all the kids should be treated the same.  Regardless of what he thinks he would do if it was one of your kids, it's really about what you would do.  Since you are adamant you would do the same if it was your own bio kid then of course you are **NTA**.  I also find it shitty that your husband is fine with you doing all of the heavy lifting with the niece while he goes on vacation with your kids.  That's pretty shitty, even if your are the better suited caregiver..  If you are adopting this child you are ONE family.  Don't leave this child behind.", "NTA\n\nLook at it this way. If you had four kids of your own, and the youngest was sick, would you hire a babysitter to watch the youngest so that you could go and have fun with the older kids? Of course you wouldn't. \n\nYou're not putting your niece above your kids - you're treating her like your kid, which is what you should be doing, given that you have care of her at the moment.", "NTA, i will be kind and say maybe your husband is juzt having a hard time adapting to having a special needs kid?

What do the other kids have to say? Do they feel like you are prioritising her over all of them?", "NTA but are u sure it\u2019s just a virus? I\u2019m more concerned about your niece still being sick after 6 days than whether you\u2019re being an AH for tending to a sick child under your care\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t take a kid anywhere being sick and definitely wouldn\u2019t put the burden on some teenager you barely know.", "You are so NTA. Infact you are awesome.  I understand your husband's disappointment but your nieces disappointment trumps his. Sorry hubby.\n\nYour both saints for taking on your special needs niece but once you make a commitment to a kid that is it. They come first. \n\nHusband should take your kids on the hike and you should plan a special at home day with your niece.  Special food, special shows. Make it into a fun daytime pajama party for you and her. Watch her favorite movies build a pillow and blanket fort (im sure if you explained the situation to housekeeping they would be happy to provideextra pillows and blankets), then your hubby and kids can join when they get back! Everyone watching movies your kids pick when they get back so your kids feel special too.", "NTA and point out to your husband that the neighbor really shouldn't babysit because she can catch and spread the virus to her family. Teen babysitters shouldn't watch sick kids. Adult babysitters pass on sick kids too.", "NTA since your niece does need special care as you mentioned asking a stranger let alone a teenage girl to take care of her would be unfair to everyone. Also your niece is sick is a teenage babysitter really the best care giver in such a scenario?  You're right she is in your care and you should do your best by her as long as she is.", "Kids that are technically under the state's care and not fully adopted are not allowed to be moved across state lines. It's a human trafficking  and jurisdiction concern.", "Her case is headed towards adoption but she isn\u2019t up for adoption yet. Her parents are still able to say we can\u2019t take her out of state", "I got the feeling that since now she is up for adoption, that that's why they were able to take her on vacation with them. They couldn't before because her parents had a say. At least i think it's like this", "I had the same question.", "Happy Cake Day!", "We had a phone appointment with a doctor. They said it\u2019s a virus and we need to wait it out.", "Tbf, it's also not right for the other kids to miss out on vacation days. This could cause resentment. I completely understand op however. Last year, me, my husband and our 2 kids went on vacation for a week, and our daughter got very sick. We took turns staying with her at the hotel, while the other went with our son.", "I whole heartedly agree.  If OP is considering adoption,  the neice is kid #4, immediate family.   \n\nNTA", "They haven\u2019t complained about it. They know that she\u2019s sick and there isn\u2019t much I can do about it", "It\u2019s 4 days. She got sick on day 2 of vacation and we\u2019re on day 6 now.", "They can\u2019t tell that over the phone\u2026", "You waited 6 days, YTA for not taking her in person by now.", "Idk where OP is but here in the UK it\u2019s nigh on impossible to get an in-person appointment. \nWe\u2019ve tried for several serious issues with members of my family and it\u2019s a phone call every time no matter how hard we press for in-person.\n\nYou can show up and they\u2019ll still tell you a doctor will call, even if you\u2019re right there in the damn GP\u2019s they\u2019ll send you away. It\u2019s infuriating.", "She\u2019s only been sick for 4 days. Fever and vomiting are also signs of a stomach virus.", "For something like a strep test? That\u2019s terrifying. I had a patient who went septic from untreated strep and the pressers he was put on to save his life caused him to lose most of his fingers and toes. He was a young adult too. It\u2019s not something you can put off", "OP if it was a stomach virus she should have been getting better by now. You need to get her checked in person. Did you even do a covid test?", "It\u2019s been awful, I do live in an area known well for being under the poverty line (yay) but we haven\u2019t been able to get in person for ages. \n\nI think the wait list here is currently something like a month to see a GP? I recently had a bout of ill health that culminated in popped ribs, got to urgent care and FINALLY got treated for what turned out to be pneumonia, not just \u2018a really bad chesty cough\u2019 per the phone call diagnosis -_-", "NTA, but make sure you, your husband, and your kids are on the same page with the potential of completing adoption. Your niece is younger than your group and has high needs. Family meeting or therapy may be good to talk this out so everyone is heard out before a decision is final. Special needs children will take time away from your older children and will be a long-term commitment if she is delayed. Adoption and providing a safe home for a child is a wonderful experience if everyone is equally on board. I want to say here I am not ant-adoption of special needs children. We have adopted special needs children and it worked out well for us. If your family decides this is not for you then please notify the placement agency immediately.", "NTA. What would happen if she got worse and wasn't able to tell the babysitter, for example? Leaving a sick child with a stranger when it's not necessary is never nice, but with additional needs it can be dangerous as well. \n\nYou're not putting your niece over your kids, you're taking care of a sick child because she needs taken care of. As long as you're caring for her, she is one of your children and gets to be treated as such - the other kids can still do their trip with dad.", "NTA. But don\u2019t adopt this child. It will make your life exponentially more difficult.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are neglecting your own kids for your niece.", "NTA", "For your question: you are NTA. You are a parental figure and you act like one. Your husband is showing some astonishing lack of compassion and I don't know if that is because he is tired of dealing with the other 3 kids alone or something else. Keep in mind that if you do adopt niece, you need to figure out what is his deal first.", "NTA.. I think you are putting the best interest of the niece first.\nHusband needs to get over it", "NTA I don\u2019t know the laws in your area but when my parents were foster parents not only could they not leave the state with the kids(without special permission) but all care providers had to either be licensed childcare or someone who\u2019s background had been checked and pre-approved. I wouldn\u2019t leave my dog with someone I only nee 6 days.", "NTA \n\nYou have a duty of care towards her. Aaaand\u2026 what babysitter would take on a sick kid they just met?", "NTA. I agree with you. If you're gonna adopt the kid, she's your kid.", "YWBTA for asking a babysitter to watch a sick kid.\n\nEdit: you would be the asshole if you asked.", "It also might be a wake up call for the OP and her husband if this is how they want to live and coparent a special needs kid going forward.", "do this before adopting her. taking on a special needs child is a lot of work, on top of having other kids. if it\u2019s something your interested in that\u2019s fine, if he\u2019s not,  that\u2019s fines too", ">I also find it shitty that your husband is fine with you doing all of the heavy lifting with the niece while he goes on vacation with your kids.

Should the whole family suffer for niece being sick?", "he clearly isn\u2019t too on board with the adoption, which is completely fine. it\u2019s a lot to take on", "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a mix of having a hard time adapting and resenting that we were lied to about her abilities.", "That is her family. \n\nYou are an asshole.", "She didn't. That was what her husband wanted her to do.", "Kids don\u2019t always complain when something is upsetting them", "Its not easy and it takes time to get used to. I think you are a wonderful person fot taking her in", "are you sure he even wants to proceed with adoption?", "My bad, I\u2019ve edited my judgement"]}
