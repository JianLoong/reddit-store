Your niece is younger than your group and has high needs. Family meeting or therapy may be good to talk this out so everyone is heard out before a decision is final.

Adoption and providing a safe home for a child is a wonderful experience if everyone is equally on board. I want to say here I am not ant-adoption of special needs children.

I understand the \u201c she\u2019s family \u201c rhetoric but there\u2019s just so much more to taking on a special needs child permanently. You have to include your children in this dialogue as well. Resentments can build and ruin your family dynamic for years if not permanently.

You\u2019re an awesome person but you have to slow this down and dot all the I\u2019s and cross all the T\u2019s before moving forward.

I would say it\u2019s rare for a seven year old to still be working on toilet training if a child didn\u2019t have one of those disability categories or really severe neglect. You need a complete picture of what is going on for her so that she\u2019s got the appropriate programming and supports.  An autistic child will need a lot of support - which absolutely should not include ABA therapy and expectations that she should behave just like neurotypical children.

Pressors by definition are supposed to keep the blood pressure up because the body can\u2019t do it on its own at this point in time. \n\n\n2. Our heart (and our brain and lungs and kidneys and the really important shit) all need blood to function at their specific jobs. Pressors specifically focus on blood to the heart and the central parts of our body. Our most important organs are centrally located. That leaves extremities. You take away blood and extremities are the first to go. Tourniquets, type 2 diabetes, foot injuries etc it\u2019s just how our circulation system works \n\n\n3. When you become septic your blood pressure drops as a result (septicemia is also a systematic reaction). In this case, the pressors kept his brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, etc and the centrally located important things and saved his life but lost his fingers and toes.", "Ah, that makes a lot of sense! I think I'm glad my doctors never mentioned this as a risk. It was stressful enough watching the infection keep spreading despite all the antibiotics. I gather I could have died, though I wasn't actually thinking like that.

I don\u2019t know how an adoption will happen.  \n\nI think the two of you need to set down with a therapist and have a hard open conversation about the adoption. And decide what to do from there.

Also hiring a babysitter to watch a sick kid is not only hurting the child that probably wants their caregivers but harming the sitter because they can get sick as well if the child is contagious.", "Absolutely not. Your niece has needs that mean she needs a caregiver who is more highly qualified and vetted than most children. That is your job.\n\nAlso are you fostering her officially?

They go on vacation with foster parents all the time. If parents still have their parental rights they must sign off on any trip out of state.

The beltway travels through all three states. If I were to go past that, I do not need permission in Kentucky unless it involves an overnight, but I would need permission in Ohio and Indiana.\n\nIn case you're interested, there is Midwest skiing just off the beltway in Indiana, obviously only in the winter. There is a amusement park north of the beltway in Ohio. In Ohio, inside of the beltway there is a zoo, theaters, museums, etc.  Since the schools do field trips to these places, it's very complicated if you need to get permission every time they leave Kentucky.", "Bot.

But more y t a... You essentially forced this child on your husband and other kids. Appreciate that she is family but sounds like your family is now struggling as a result. Maybe she is better off in foster care than your own?", "NTA in this instance, you are currently responsible for her care. But I do think you, your husband and your kids need to sit down and get your childrens thoughts on this being a permanent thing and then you and your husband need to talk it out, just you two. I'm sensing some resentment from him at least and probably your kids. Its lovely that you've taken her in at the moment but I think you need to decide as a family if making it permanent is really viable", "NTA. But. Your husband clearly doesn't want this child as a permanent part of his family - and that's okay. He shouldn't be forced to. The two of you need to discuss the future and what is in the best interests of the niece (because living in a house with an adoptive father who resents her is NOT in her best interest).", "This is confusing, OP can't take her out of state but seems to have done just that; she might be adopted but her parents are saying what these relatives can and can't do with her.  They are vacationing but kinda know the neighbors.  I'm lost.", "For this specific situation of course NAT, but you have to have a very serious conversation with your husband and your children about the future of your niece, because from the post you can understand that they are not very open to the idea of having her permanent, let's be honest it's completely reasonable. Good luck and hope the little girl get well soon.", "NTA. You are a family and family makes compromises for each other. Since you wouldn\u2019t leave your sick bio kids to go on vacation, you shouldn\u2019t leave the niece.", "NTA - you're behaving responsibly, your husband is not. Your husband should watch your niece for a bit so *you* can enjoy this vacation.", "I wouldn\u2019t abandon her again. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t leave a child with people you don\u2019t know well.\n\nCan you get one of those push cart wagons and go to the park for a shorter time than the rest of the family?", "NTA. You can make it up to your kids. Also if the adoption goes thru she is one of your kids. You would do the same for them all I\u2019m sure.", "NTA, but you will be if you move forward with adoption without having a serious conversation with your husband. It will be traumatizing to bring this poor girl into a permanent home where one of her guardians treats her like a burden and prioritizes the wants of his biological children over the needs of his adopted child. It sounds like you genuinely care about your niece; please, don't put her in that position.", "NTA\n\nBased on your husband\u2019s reaction, I am going to guess she\u2019s the daughter of one of your siblings, not one of his.", "NTA your niece/foster child is sick, you needed to be there for her. Your other kids are still able to enjoy their vacation with Dad. Had one of the other kids been sick would your husband still expect you to hire a sitter?  I echo what others have said and hope you are seeking counseling to determine if you are both going to love and care for your niece.", "This is great advice. They might also want to take into consideration that this will probably be a lifetime commitment. If her special needs are as mentioned,  she will probably not be living on her own as an adult.", "That's irrelevant, the system is involved so there is obviously a reason that we don't need to know", "And they will need to figure out a long-term solution that doesn't involve her cousins being responsible for her.", "Is her healthcare covered by the state?  If so, I'd consider a visit to a hospital ER.\n\nIf you don't know, that's another factor to consider in adoption: if you foster the state should cover most of her health and therapy.   What happens if you adopt her?", "As a doctor....ummm go take her to see a doctor....", "How long has she been with you?   Did she have any kind of therapy program before?   It seems that you are doing catch up in a situation that will require a lot of ongoing time investment by you and your husband.   \n\nFrom what you describe, your kids are in a number of time intensive activities that would be affected by this additional commitment.   This incident can serve as a starting point for an honest assessment about how much you can realistically do for her without jeopardizing your relationships with your children.   That's a multi-part discussion to be had with your husband as well as a family therapist.", "It's not just her life. She has a husband and three kids that she has to think about. Adopting a special needs child affects ALL of them. Money, time, and other resources are limited. If they have to give the niece more it takes from the other kids. We see it on reddit all the time, kids who are emotionally/mentally damaged because their parent had to focus on a special needs child. This is 1000% a two yes/ one no situation.", "Agreeing with @Zestyclose_Media_548 \n\nI don't know the laws in your area, but you'll want to have these evals done BEFORE adoption, so you have a clear picture of her needs, and if you will be able to provide for them.\n\nA friend was asked to provide an emergency kinship placement for her niece. The Case Worker had ZERO info about the kid, and dropped her off with only a single change of clothing.\n\nThe kid hadn't had medical care or vaccines. Mouth full of cavities. Needed diapers. Non-verbal. Afraid of the dark and large dogs.  All info that would've been SUPER helpful.\n\nFortunately a court-appointed guardian told them \"Get her evals NOW, and the State will cover much, if not all, of the costs.\"  Kid got dental care, vaccines, a neuro-psych eval, and different therapies.  She has autism, and a vision problem- both of which were previously unknown.\n\nKid's not been cleared for adoption yet, BUT now our friend knows what the kiddo needs, and how to get it.  AND that she is willing and able to do what the kid needs to thrive.", "It's great that you care so much for your niece and that you're prioritising her. But at what expense? If your husband/children said no they doesn't want to move forward with the adoption what would you do? Taking in any child is already a disruption to your home but one with special needs, where your husband has already said he might not adapt may put your family in jeopardy. \n\nYour husband wanted you to join in on a family experience, from his point of view a \"non\" family member took priority over your family, including your husbands wants.\n\nLeaving her for the hike with neighbours to have a family moment wouldn't have been the worst thing to do.\n\nslight YTA", "NTA - but I do not think that adopting her is the right call for your household, especially since you were not made aware about your niece's condition before housing her. A special needs child with as many complications as your niece has is going to require a great deal of attention and specialized care, a speech therapist, a behavior therapist etc. All things that are quite costly considering that you additionally have three other children to care for.\n\nThen there is the matter of your other children to think about. Considering they are in extracirricular activities, will paying for your niece to get the treatments she requires impact your ability to financially support your children's hobbies? Will taking in your niece place additional limitations on your family vacations/outings? If your niece has sensory issues, certain locations that your kids enjoy might cause problems for her (crowded amusement parks, their sports games etc).\nThese are important questions to ask and answer because they can lead to your children resenting your niece if her presence holds them back from things that they have enjoyed in life thus far. Most kids already won't be interested in playing with or hanging out with someone 5/8/10 years younger than them, but if this kid's presence actively placed limitations on their lives, that could fester a deep resentment over the years and cause them to isolate her - which would obviously make your niece feel terrible in turn.\n\nLastly, there is your marriage to think about. It doesn't seem like your husband is entirely on board with adopting your niece. This is not a light issue and something you two need to discuss, in detail, ASAP, to make a decision.\nIt seems like your niece's needs were not being attended to with her biological parents, causing her to be further behind developmentally than she should. Are you BOTH going to be able to handle this long term? Your niece will require far more attention than all of your other kids combined, and you'll have to give her this attention while also not taking away too much of your time from your other children to avoid causing resentment.\nThis is a huge undertaking both emotionally and physically that you are considering here. If you are both not 100% on board with this adoption, the stresses of raising a low-functioning, neurodivergent child will strain your relationship over time.\n\n\nReally take some time to research the type and level of care your niece would require to reach a proper level of development for her age. Ask yourself if you are going to be able to provide that while not detracting from the three kids you already have. Ask your husband is he going to be able to provide what your niece needs while also not detracting from the kids you already have. Will you and your husband still be able to make some time for just yourselves (he two of you) to mentally relax/recharge?\nIf the answer is \"no\" to any of these, do not adopt her.", "NTA. Your husband is being a bit of an ah. But I can also see that he might be worried that if your niece joins the family that you will no longer be able to devote as much time to your other children. I would guess he does not want to adopt and might not be telling you, or he doesn't want your kids to feel like their lives are going to be uprooted.\n\nIt's time to have a talk about the future.", "WTAF is wrong with your husband? She is family, 7 years old and with special needs. She should feel like she's part of the family, not someone to be excluded. \n\nYou are amazing staying with her, which is what normal people would do for their kids \n\nThe fact that she isn't with her parents just shows that she needs a little extra TLC.\n\nYou are NTA.", "No you\u2019re not. She\u2019s a special needs child and he wants you to pawn her off on some rando?!?!  I hope you never get sick when he wants to go on vacation.  Unless there\u2019s more you\u2019re not telling he\u2019s a major tool", "NTA but how are YOUR kids handling this?", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being absurdly callous here.    Not just about your niece and her safety,  but also about the teenage neighbor.  Because  no babysitter in their right mind would agree to sit a sick kid without a prior working relationship and substantial hazard pay and springing a sick kid on a babysitter is incredibly assholish. \n\n Your neighbor's teen daughter absolutely does not want to deal with your vomiting niece.  I know this.  I don't have to ask her.  No one wants to deal with a vomiting child.     \n\nYour husband is being both inconsiderate to your niece and to the neighbor's daughter.", "NTA - A special needs child who is incredibly sick is a lot of work and responsibility, how does your husband expect another child to properly care for her?", "Honestly, it sounds to me like the husband doesn't want to adopt her, possibly he doesn't even want to house her temporarily.", "Yeah the whole story seems sketchy. She even says they\u2019ve known the neighbors 6 days but she trusts her.", "Can you even legally leave her with a stranger RN? Kids in care here can only be left with approved caregivers pending placement.", "I would ask husband to switch out with you. he stay with neice so you can go out with the kids. If he's worried about you not spending time with the kids and making those core memory's. Then that is definitely the best option.", "Oh yeah you're so right", "I'm going to go against the grain and say, YTA.\n\nI've read so many stories on Reddit from kids who had siblings who had special needs and the parent or parents put all their time and effort into this one child and left nothing for the other kids. You have to strike a balance. You have to compromise. Yea a babysitter isn't ideal but you have to spend time.with your other kids. According to your story you spent 100%of this vacation with your attention on one kid only. Yes she has great needs, but your other kids do also.\n\nYou're heading towards a huge amount of resentment from your husband and your kids. You're trying to do the right thing but you're overshooting by a mile and hurting others.", "NAH\n\nI understand what you are saying about leaving her with a random babysitter. You can't do that and you don't know these people. If she gets worse, it's not like you can come back right away (it would be more reasonable to leave her 2 hours to go out for dinner with a babysitter, but not a full day to go hiking).\n\nBut I only see your husband's point of your. Your eldest kid is 17. They are almost adults and you are missing their last family vacations.", "NTA. Also, bring her to a doctor and find an adoption competent therapist so you can fully evaluate how you can do your do diligence to your niece, who will be your daughter, without destroying your marriage and family.", "NTA...you dont leave a sick child with an teen babysitter. That is just irresponsable to say the least.  Would you do that to one of your childs? Ask that to your husband.", "WTF? If your kid is not feeling well, regardless if she adopted, half adopted or just on a loan,  having a babysitter is a really really shitty move, so the sitter  can be sick as well?NTA", "NTA but I hope you understand that your husband doesn\u2019t want to deal with your niece. It\u2019s not his child and he is allowed to feel this way.", "NTA. It\u2019s called Respite Care. As long as the sitter is experienced with special needs children you are fine", "It is a standard part of foster care. We\u2019ve had lots of parents refuse, then the request goes to the court, and then 99% of the time the court signs off on it. It\u2019s just a way for parents to flex some power and feel in control of the situation. \n\nWe\u2019ve never had any bio parent express any sincere or reasonable reason for wanting their kid to miss out on amusement parks or going to the beach, other than \u201cmy kid shouldn\u2019t be in care so I\u2019m going to make this as difficult as possible for everyone.\u201d It is very sad and comes back to bite them at court.", "You can buy strep and flu tests at the pharmacy", "Honestly. What happens if the doctors say \"Oh yeah she can totally get a job\" and then she gets worse, or they're wrong? They give her up after adopting her? How do you even predict that for a child?\n\nWhat if one of their kids gets ill or hurt and becomes permanently disabled as an adult and can't work? That's just fucked up."]}
