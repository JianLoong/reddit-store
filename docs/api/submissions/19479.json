Your niece is younger than your group and has high needs. Family meeting or therapy may be good to talk this out so everyone is heard out before a decision is final.

Adoption and providing a safe home for a child is a wonderful experience if everyone is equally on board. I want to say here I am not ant-adoption of special needs children.

I understand the \u201c she\u2019s family \u201c rhetoric but there\u2019s just so much more to taking on a special needs child permanently. You have to include your children in this dialogue as well. Resentments can build and ruin your family dynamic for years if not permanently.

You\u2019re an awesome person but you have to slow this down and dot all the I\u2019s and cross all the T\u2019s before moving forward.

I would say it\u2019s rare for a seven year old to still be working on toilet training if a child didn\u2019t have one of those disability categories or really severe neglect. You need a complete picture of what is going on for her so that she\u2019s got the appropriate programming and supports.  An autistic child will need a lot of support - which absolutely should not include ABA therapy and expectations that she should behave just like neurotypical children.

Pressors by definition are supposed to keep the blood pressure up because the body can\u2019t do it on its own at this point in time. \n\n\n2. Our heart (and our brain and lungs and kidneys and the really important shit) all need blood to function at their specific jobs. Pressors specifically focus on blood to the heart and the central parts of our body. Our most important organs are centrally located. That leaves extremities. You take away blood and extremities are the first to go. Tourniquets, type 2 diabetes, foot injuries etc it\u2019s just how our circulation system works \n\n\n3. When you become septic your blood pressure drops as a result (septicemia is also a systematic reaction). In this case, the pressors kept his brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, etc and the centrally located important things and saved his life but lost his fingers and toes.", "Ah, that makes a lot of sense! I think I'm glad my doctors never mentioned this as a risk. It was stressful enough watching the infection keep spreading despite all the antibiotics. I gather I could have died, though I wasn't actually thinking like that.

I don\u2019t know how an adoption will happen.  \n\nI think the two of you need to set down with a therapist and have a hard open conversation about the adoption. And decide what to do from there.

Your niece has needs that mean she needs a caregiver who is more highly qualified and vetted than most children. That is your job.\n\nAlso are you fostering her officially?

The beltway travels through all three states. If I were to go past that, I do not need permission in Kentucky unless it involves an overnight, but I would need permission in Ohio and Indiana.\n\nIn case you're interested, there is Midwest skiing just off the beltway in Indiana, obviously only in the winter. There is a amusement park north of the beltway in Ohio. In Ohio, inside of the beltway there is a zoo, theaters, museums, etc.  Since the schools do field trips to these places, it's very complicated if you need to get permission every time they leave Kentucky.", "Bot. [Original comment stolen from.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1467vjt/aita_for_not_getting_my_niece_a_random_babysitter/jnpbhp1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)\n\nDownvote and report, if you wouldn\u2019t mind :)", "It\u2019s very much true in a ton of states \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Which is why I specified what state.", "ESH... But more y t a... You essentially forced this child on your husband and other kids. Appreciate that she is family but sounds like your family is now struggling as a result. Maybe she is better off in foster care than your own?", "NTA in this instance, you are currently responsible for her care. But I do think you, your husband and your kids need to sit down and get your childrens thoughts on this being a permanent thing and then you and your husband need to talk it out, just you two. I'm sensing some resentment from him at least and probably your kids. Its lovely that you've taken her in at the moment but I think you need to decide as a family if making it permanent is really viable", "NTA. But. Your husband clearly doesn't want this child as a permanent part of his family - and that's okay. He shouldn't be forced to. The two of you need to discuss the future and what is in the best interests of the niece (because living in a house with an adoptive father who resents her is NOT in her best interest).", "This is confusing, OP can't take her out of state but seems to have done just that; she might be adopted but her parents are saying what these relatives can and can't do with her.  They are vacationing but kinda know the neighbors.  I'm lost.", "For this specific situation of course NAT, but you have to have a very serious conversation with your husband and your children about the future of your niece, because from the post you can understand that they are not very open to the idea of having her permanent, let's be honest it's completely reasonable. Good luck and hope the little girl get well soon.", "NTA. You are a family and family makes compromises for each other. Since you wouldn\u2019t leave your sick bio kids to go on vacation, you shouldn\u2019t leave the niece.", "NTA - you're behaving responsibly, your husband is not. Your husband should watch your niece for a bit so *you* can enjoy this vacation.", "I wouldn\u2019t abandon her again. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t leave a child with people you don\u2019t know well.\n\nCan you get one of those push cart wagons and go to the park for a shorter time than the rest of the family?", "NTA. You can make it up to your kids. Also if the adoption goes thru she is one of your kids. You would do the same for them all I\u2019m sure.", "NTA, but you will be if you move forward with adoption without having a serious conversation with your husband. It will be traumatizing to bring this poor girl into a permanent home where one of her guardians treats her like a burden and prioritizes the wants of his biological children over the needs of his adopted child. It sounds like you genuinely care about your niece; please, don't put her in that position.", "NTA\n\nBased on your husband\u2019s reaction, I am going to guess she\u2019s the daughter of one of your siblings, not one of his.", "NTA your niece/foster child is sick, you needed to be there for her. Your other kids are still able to enjoy their vacation with Dad. Had one of the other kids been sick would your husband still expect you to hire a sitter?  I echo what others have said and hope you are seeking counseling to determine if you are both going to love and care for your niece.", "This is great advice. They might also want to take into consideration that this will probably be a lifetime commitment. If her special needs are as mentioned,  she will probably not be living on her own as an adult.", "That's irrelevant, the system is involved so there is obviously a reason that we don't need to know", "And they will need to figure out a long-term solution that doesn't involve her cousins being responsible for her.", "Is her healthcare covered by the state?  If so, I'd consider a visit to a hospital ER.\n\nIf you don't know, that's another factor to consider in adoption: if you foster the state should cover most of her health and therapy.   What happens if you adopt her?", "As a doctor....ummm go take her to see a doctor....", "How long has she been with you?   Did she have any kind of therapy program before?   It seems that you are doing catch up in a situation that will require a lot of ongoing time investment by you and your husband.   \n\nFrom what you describe, your kids are in a number of time intensive activities that would be affected by this additional commitment.   This incident can serve as a starting point for an honest assessment about how much you can realistically do for her without jeopardizing your relationships with your children.   That's a multi-part discussion to be had with your husband as well as a family therapist.", "It's not just her life. She has a husband and three kids that she has to think about. Adopting a special needs child affects ALL of them. Money, time, and other resources are limited. If they have to give the niece more it takes from the other kids. We see it on reddit all the time, kids who are emotionally/mentally damaged because their parent had to focus on a special needs child. This is 1000% a two yes/ one no situation.", "Agreeing with @Zestyclose_Media_548 \n\nI don't know the laws in your area, but you'll want to have these evals done BEFORE adoption, so you have a clear picture of her needs, and if you will be able to provide for them.\n\nA friend was asked to provide an emergency kinship placement for her niece. The Case Worker had ZERO info about the kid, and dropped her off with only a single change of clothing.\n\nThe kid hadn't had medical care or vaccines. Mouth full of cavities. Needed diapers. Non-verbal. Afraid of the dark and large dogs.  All info that would've been SUPER helpful.\n\nFortunately a court-appointed guardian told them \"Get her evals NOW, and the State will cover much, if not all, of the costs.\"  Kid got dental care, vaccines, a neuro-psych eval, and different therapies.  She has autism, and a vision problem- both of which were previously unknown.\n\nKid's not been cleared for adoption yet, BUT now our friend knows what the kiddo needs, and how to get it.  AND that she is willing and able to do what the kid needs to thrive."]}
