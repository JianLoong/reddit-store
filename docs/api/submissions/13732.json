He appreciates the insight and people sharing their experiences since it really helped him see his was the uncommon one. \n\nHe admits he dove headfirst at 1000% into this whole thing, which he has a habit of doing and one of the adorable quirks I've come to love over the years. Never half ass tries something, always very overly passionate for maybe a week or so before he \"calms down\". He feels guilty for it coming off as him wanting to dismiss my experience and feelings for the fake \"perfect family\" image. Which he swears is not his intent, and I believe him.\n\nHis reason for wanting us to go as a whole family was partly because he misses the sense of community he felt growing up from the church and ideally was in the mindset that us going as a family will give our kids that same feeling/experience as they grow. He thought many of my negative experiences came from me going to church with my broken family, but he listened and asked me to explain in detail (if I was comfortable) exactly the type of stuff I went through. After I did he realizes that our children will most likely end up subject to it as well. Our older child was born before we married (regardless of the church not acknowledging our marriage), and our younger one I was pregnant at the wedding with. He understands now that most of the ridicule I got and hate I experienced was mainly from just existing and nothing I personally had any control over. He doesn't want our children going through that or risking myself reliving it. \n\nHe still wants to get back into it because he truly feels like he's missing something in his life and thinks this may be it since it was a huge part of his life for a long time, which I fully support. But he plans to start by just watching mass online for a bit. He even spoke to his best friend about all of this and his friend reiterated that believing and following the faith does not mean you need to physically go to the building. He also quoted Big Bang Theory as someone in the comments on the original post did. \n\nAs for the children, as they get older we plan to explain our beliefs to them as well as others out there, but as they grow, if they decide it's not for them either at all, or find one they believe fits them better than mine and my husband's we will support them because being a parent means loving your children as they are, not as you try and make them be. They will be taught to be kind and show love, but not because the church says to, because it's what good people do religious or not.", "created_utc": 1680368713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128s7f8/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_force_my_kids_to/", "score": 24, "replies": ["I am glad to hear that your husband listened to you.", "Love that he\u2019s hearing you and considering your children.  I am a recovering Catholic, and I know that sense of missing community.  It\u2019s not an real community if they aren\u2019t loving and accepting of you.  Why don\u2019t you see if there are some mutual aid or organization you can join.  A sense of community and doing good works would be excellent for the children too.", "You need to get him a hobby, I still wouldn't let those people near your children even if husband decides he wants moooooore church.", "That's something we are looking into as well! Our tiny town/neighboring towns are very limited but we do have friends about an hour away in a larger area that we might look into joining for some activities around them!"]}
