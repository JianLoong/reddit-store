He appreciates the insight and people sharing their experiences since it really helped him see his was the uncommon one. \n\nHe admits he dove headfirst at 1000% into this whole thing, which he has a habit of doing and one of the adorable quirks I've come to love over the years. Never half ass tries something, always very overly passionate for maybe a week or so before he \"calms down\". He feels guilty for it coming off as him wanting to dismiss my experience and feelings for the fake \"perfect family\" image. Which he swears is not his intent, and I believe him.\n\nHis reason for wanting us to go as a whole family was partly because he misses the sense of community he felt growing up from the church and ideally was in the mindset that us going as a family will give our kids that same feeling/experience as they grow. He thought many of my negative experiences came from me going to church with my broken family, but he listened and asked me to explain in detail (if I was comfortable) exactly the type of stuff I went through. After I did he realizes that our children will most likely end up subject to it as well. Our older child was born before we married (regardless of the church not acknowledging our marriage), and our younger one I was pregnant at the wedding with. He understands now that most of the ridicule I got and hate I experienced was mainly from just existing and nothing I personally had any control over. He doesn't want our children going through that or risking myself reliving it. \n\nHe still wants to get back into it because he truly feels like he's missing something in his life and thinks this may be it since it was a huge part of his life for a long time, which I fully support. But he plans to start by just watching mass online for a bit. He even spoke to his best friend about all of this and his friend reiterated that believing and following the faith does not mean you need to physically go to the building. He also quoted Big Bang Theory as someone in the comments on the original post did. \n\nAs for the children, as they get older we plan to explain our beliefs to them as well as others out there, but as they grow, if they decide it's not for them either at all, or find one they believe fits them better than mine and my husband's we will support them because being a parent means loving your children as they are, not as you try and make them be. They will be taught to be kind and show love, but not because the church says to, because it's what good people do religious or not.", "created_utc": 1680368713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128s7f8/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_force_my_kids_to/", "score": 300, "replies": ["I am glad to hear that your husband listened to you.", "Love that he\u2019s hearing you and considering your children.  I am a recovering Catholic, and I know that sense of missing community.  It\u2019s not an real community if they aren\u2019t loving and accepting of you.  Why don\u2019t you see if there are some mutual aid or organization you can join.  A sense of community and doing good works would be excellent for the children too.", "You need to get him a hobby, I still wouldn't let those people near your children even if husband decides he wants moooooore church.", "That's something we are looking into as well! Our tiny town/neighboring towns are very limited but we do have friends about an hour away in a larger area that we might look into joining for some activities around them!", "> if they decide it's not for them either at all, or find one they believe fits them better than mine and my husband's we will support them because being a parent means loving your children as they are, not as you try and make them be.

I'm glad your husband was open to changing his mind. :)", "NTA. We have 4 children. When they were growing up, they were sent to Sunday school and confirmation at the same church that father, their grandparents and great-grandparents had all attended. I rarely went to Sunday school as a child, was never confirmed and therefore, felt a lack of something, though I could not say specifically what it was. I joined the church a few months before we married. We told our children that after they were confirmed, it was up to them to choose whether they wanted to attend or not. We just wanted them to have the basis for the decision. If they wanted to learn about other religions, or even other Christian religions, that was entirely up to them.", "Glad to hear this. My upbringing in the Christian religion was very abusive. I told my husband I would refuse to get married in a church and if we had kids, they would attend a religious school over my dead body. I break down crying if I go into a church. \n\nI have my faith, but I don't ever see a future where I attend church regularly again.", "Info: how rural are you now? Can you attend a different parish? I live in a diocese in a suburban area and can drive 20 min in any direction and be someplace new. Masstimes.org will help you.\n\nAlso, why were you there Wednesdays? Twice a week isn\u2019t really our style", "I appreciate it!! All we want for our kids it to grow up happy and healthy, aaaannnddd to be decent people \ud83d\ude05 as long as they find happiness, legally, we support whatever path they will take in life.", "Y'all might wanna try looking for an Episcopal church. I'm sure of course there are some bad ones out there, but in my years of going and having attended several, it's a really warm and loving community with far less judgment. And, at least at the churches I've attended, there is a warmth and kindness in the community that may give you what you both need!", "There\u2019s no hate like religious love!\nGlad this turned out good for you and your kids!", "If your husband wants to feel in a community, there are many places where you will not be implanted with dogmas, homophobia, racism, intolerance, anti-vaccine ideas, hypocrisy in a crowd, if his desire is to have a healthy family, religion is not the best place.", "This is how you do religion.\n\nI have no personal hate to the Christian religion. But the church, I have a problem with. I don\u2019t understand how people can take something that teaches love and tolerance, and turn it into the hatful evil weapon. I spent 18 years dealing with that abuse and I\u2019m so glad I left.", "Most churches, Catholic Church especially are just big money laundering schemes and full of predators. Make sure to vet anyone your children come in contact with. Your husband sounds so excited that he\u2019s forgetting some huge SA scandals. The south just had arrests at major mega church that helped smaller parishes. As someone with accounting experience and nonprofit if salaries are more than 15-20% the nonprofit is probably more likely to shady or a money laundering scheme. My foster grandmother was good friend with Trans secretary and he did not have good words about the Red Cross. Best of luck finding an equal ground.", "He's going to end up divorcing OP and finding a church wife. If it was just faith, he wouldn't. But he wants the sense of belonging and community. He's not going to get that from online sermons.", "Are you really tied to the Catholic faith?  Or more just a Christian faith?  I don't know your community, but if there are other Christian churches, you might want to go and see if they feel more relatable.", "I'm so sorry you had to experience such trauma that it brings you to tears! I've mostly come to terms with the shit I had to go through, but will NEVER expose my kids to it. I'm thankful my family wasn't financially set enough for me to attend a private school. As bad as that sounds", "I'm the same. Too much trauma in a \"safe\" space means that space isn't *actually* safe.", "No matter what church you go to, at the end they are all the same, full of hypocrites. I am glad I walked away from religion once I was old enough.", "It is that the problem is not with the church, it is with religion, religion is a political weapon that moves people as they see fit, the problem is that it uses the excuse of \"it is only this church, the next one will be different\" when they are all like that", "He hasn't forgotten about all the SA scandals. He's aware that happens anywhere. We both know just because it hasn't happened around us doesn't mean it never will, but he's got hope that isn't something our community will have to deal with. \n\nWe always are careful who we allow around our kids.", "It's what my family did growing up, in addition to religion classes Wednesdays I also was taken to the Wednesday night mass at my church. \n\nAs for how rural, we are a \"town\" of about 500. Closes larger one is 45 minutes away. \n\nI currently have no desire to attend even a different parish. Ours is the only one in the area as the ones in neighboring towns were torn down over the last decade, aside from the \"sister\" parish 2 towns over but the priest from ours is also theirs.", "That's something I'm exploring on my own currently", "You may consider looking into events at UU churches as well.  It's technically not a religion but I know many ex Christians who go to UU churches for the community", "I totally agree! That\u2019s why it\u2019s \u201creligious love\u201d.", "You sound like good parents who want to give them a well rounded upbringing. I wasn\u2019t clear in my specific comment. I\u2019m from a more larger community constantly need to check online for comments or reviews. And my advice on nonprofits I wish wasn\u2019t from first hand. Boards should not be able to write themselves bonuses at the end the year so the company doesn\u2019t have over the approved amount the NP is allowed to keep in reserves. The percentage was the advice was from my grandmother. Best luck on your journey.", "I never knew how shady non profits can get, that was definitely a bit of a shock \ud83d\ude05 but I appreciate the insight there. The world is just money hungry and non profits are the ones always \"starving\""]}
