He appreciates the insight and people sharing their experiences since it really helped him see his was the uncommon one. \n\nHe admits he dove headfirst at 1000% into this whole thing, which he has a habit of doing and one of the adorable quirks I've come to love over the years. Never half ass tries something, always very overly passionate for maybe a week or so before he \"calms down\". He feels guilty for it coming off as him wanting to dismiss my experience and feelings for the fake \"perfect family\" image. Which he swears is not his intent, and I believe him.\n\nHis reason for wanting us to go as a whole family was partly because he misses the sense of community he felt growing up from the church and ideally was in the mindset that us going as a family will give our kids that same feeling/experience as they grow. He thought many of my negative experiences came from me going to church with my broken family, but he listened and asked me to explain in detail (if I was comfortable) exactly the type of stuff I went through. After I did he realizes that our children will most likely end up subject to it as well. Our older child was born before we married (regardless of the church not acknowledging our marriage), and our younger one I was pregnant at the wedding with. He understands now that most of the ridicule I got and hate I experienced was mainly from just existing and nothing I personally had any control over. He doesn't want our children going through that or risking myself reliving it. \n\nHe still wants to get back into it because he truly feels like he's missing something in his life and thinks this may be it since it was a huge part of his life for a long time, which I fully support. But he plans to start by just watching mass online for a bit. He even spoke to his best friend about all of this and his friend reiterated that believing and following the faith does not mean you need to physically go to the building. He also quoted Big Bang Theory as someone in the comments on the original post did. \n\nAs for the children, as they get older we plan to explain our beliefs to them as well as others out there, but as they grow, if they decide it's not for them either at all, or find one they believe fits them better than mine and my husband's we will support them because being a parent means loving your children as they are, not as you try and make them be.

I joined the church a few months before we married. We told our children that after they were confirmed, it was up to them to choose whether they wanted to attend or not.

I'm an only child born in 1970. They were married in a Catholic ceremony.\n\nI never recalled any issues between them over religion. They agreed to have me baptized and the only thing Mum said was that she was asked by Dad to have me raised Catholic and attend Catholic schools if possible, but that I could always choose my path after I was done with HS.\n\nDad was (and still is) a regular Mass goer and  participant in his Church. Mum voluntarily went to church with us on Christmas and Easter and would assist me with various religious participation stuff in school and with my sacraments by her choice.\n\nOnce I went to college and after, I stopped going to Mass every Sunday, and today I only go when it's a wedding, funerals and Xmas/Holy Week/Easter. \n\nOther than the occasional joking by my Dad from time to time about going to church, he has never had an issue with me being a lapsed Catholic. He never had an issue with Mum either. \n\nObviously, no one's experience is going to be the same, but I think because they would sit down and communicate about it with each other and me (when I was older), helped a ton in this scenario. \n\nI have my own issues with the Church as well, but I am like you in that I still have my faith. I think that your husband has probably had the same life experience that my Dad has, and for him and Mum (til she passed), the way they worked it out was being respectful of each other's ways of being religious.
