A child doesn't go NC with their parent for no reason.\r  \n\r  \nYou said your daughter and bf fight a lot, but chalk it off to her being a teen, which sounds to me like  you take his side over hers.

I read your comments and it's becoming clear that your daughter likely left for the following reasons:\n\n1. Parentification. You mention she 'only' babysat when you and your partner were at work. That's a problem - presumably you both work a considerable amount, and whilst your son is now in school, you still need to cough up for childcare instead of always relying on your daughter. \n\n2. Excessive chores. You say she did all the chores after you got home from hospital having had your son - what on earth was your boyfriend doing?! It's becoming clear why she dislikes him. A 9 year old doing 'all the chores' is utterly unacceptable. \n\n3. Lack of involvement from you. Everything you write is so passive- you don't seem to have spent time actually getting to know your daughter. You dismiss fights she had with your bf as her being a teenager - how lazy.\n\nAll in all, it reads like she raised herself.", "You assumed your daughter's opposition to your bf was being a teenager, but if she's 19 and your son is 9, then she was only 10 years old when he was born, and 9 (or younger) when you got involved with your bf. \n\nDoesn't add up.

Because you have a 9 year old by another man. Or did you lie about the parentage of your daughter's half brother? \n\nIf your child has the presence of mine to skip out the DAY they turn adult with all their relevant paperwork, you're probably the one in the wrong. She had to have made plans and you didn't pay attention to her.", "INFO: What do you mean by \"helped me with my son since he was born\"?", ">My daughter has never got along with my boyfriend, they constantly fight with each other, I just put it down to her being a teenager.\n\nYTA, and nothing you can do now will change how you treated her during that time.", "It's hard to say without knowing more. But a big red flag here is how she doesn't get along at all with your boyfriend and you just gloss over that fact, like haha she's just a teenager. She may also be tired of being an unpaid babysitter. Her taking the drastic step of leaving the entire country in the middle of the night makes me suspect there's a lot more going on that you're leaving out. So I'm leaning more towards YTA right now.", "YTA for speaking like your daughter is a possession.

Was effort made by either parent for her to visit her dad? Why did her dad move out of the country anyway? \n\nThis boyfriend of yours, you said your daughter started fights with him\u2026 putting all the blame on your daughter. How does your bf treat her? Does he also see her as a free babysitter for his kid? Does he try to force himself on her in a fatherly role? Does he treat her like she\u2019s an outsider? Did you get a therapist or family counselor to help them build a better relationship?\n\nHow was your relationship with your daughter?

It also sounds like you pushed a lot of the caregiving of your son onto your daughter from the age of 12.\n\nTBH, this really sounds like a kid who decided to get out many years ago, and has just put her head down until she could which leads me to believe that there are a few things you\u2019ve left out of your side of the story.

But nope, she immediately checks the safe to see if her daughters personal documents were there, then called her ex in another country.

The cheating bit is really he said she said situation which we can't judge on but purely based on your attitude towards your daughter you definitely are TA. \n\nThese things I've mentioned above can condition your daughter into understanding that 1) she is always second to you 2) love is conditional and that she would not be valued in this family unless she's in any use for you and 3) you are not a safe support system for her and she has to become independent/reliant on other people to fend for her. Children are brought into this world without their consent and it's really unfair for you to believe that they owe you anything simply because you've taken care of them for years. Yeah sure your ex probably didn't pull his weight in physically to raise your daughter or could be feeding her lies but she's probably independent enough to make good choices best for herself, maybe he's actually take her more seriously and have more understanding to her struggles, or she just resents this household so much she feels safer living with your \"liar\" of an ex than you+your boyfriend. \n\nYou've digged your own grave with your actions really. You probably made her resent you, your boyfriend and especially your son because of all these years of parenting she was burdened with that isn't even her responsibilities. I feel sad for both your children as they'll probably never have a great relationship because of what you've put your daughter through. If you really want to be the good  mom here please consider reflecting all these things through therapy, give your daughter the space and quietness she needs until she's ready to talk. The more you stubbornly refuses to admit your mistakes and force contact with your daughter the more she'll drift away, and I'm speaking from experience here as I am on the lowest contact with my parents because of this.

That's the only way the timeline fits without some serious long term cheating.", "I think 9m means 9 months old, not a 9 year old male.  It would make more sense time wise if she split with her ex a few years ago.", "I'm a little scared to hear the answer to this \ud83d\udc80", "I was so stupid. I thought maybe yay it was a ticket to go visit dad.

So presumably 40 hours a week.", "Yup, I assumed OP cheated even before reading her comments. Something about her and her ex breaking up \"a few years ago\" and having a 9 year old son with the new bf just didn't sit right.", "OP has a comment about the daughter babysitting the kid as a toddler, so I\u2019d say he\u2019s 9yo", "Daughter is 19 and left the day she turned 18, so son is definitely 9 years old.", "That's true but usually it's written out or abbreviated as mo or mos. Still, there's definitely more there. Especially with daughter saying she knows the truth and ex saying he only told her the truth.", "I think it's 9 years. You don't build up that kind of resentment in less than a year.", "I believe she is indicating he\u2019s a 9 year old male in Reddit shorthand 9(male)", "OP made a comment that her daughter only started babysitting once he became a toddler. A 9 month old is in no way a toddler so the kid is definitely 9 years old. No wonder her daughter believes she cheated on her dad.", "She also wrote daughter (19f). I think we'd all assume she meant female without reddit shorthand.", "Michelle Duggar", "My parents. I was 6.", "I think she stopped replying when she realised that this sub doesn\u2019t side with parents when their children decide to go NC.", "She didn\u2019t find out.. she knew.. you can\u2019t read that comment and think they were talking about the ex", "Children don\u2019t go NC with a parent if there\u2019s no problem. \n\nThere\u2019s also a lot of missing missing reasons here so that indicates that there is a problem with mom. I wouldn\u2019t know what the problem is because of the missing missing reasons, but there\u2019s a problem.", "OP said in a comnent that daughter only starting watching him \"once he became a toddler.\" Soooo....yeah, there's some math that's not mathing.", "No she means 9 year old. In another comment, she said her daughter has been watching him since he was a toddler.\n\nEdit Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl8k0w/aita_for_trying_to_get_my_daughter_to_come_back/j03z931/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3", "She gets to baby sit for a long weekend all by herself to bind with her sibling and they kindly left her a load of chores because she\u2019ll have the whole weekend to do them (I\u2019m making this up btw)", "We can hope. \ud83d\ude04 I kinda doubt it considering the way OP talks about her ex, tho.", "And there we have it!! That along with the arguments between your daughter and your partner..is the reason she ran as soon as she was 18. It appears your daughter did not want to be a babysitter...did not like your boyfriend...and wanted a job to get some money...but she had to do chores instead.\n\nAlso her move was planned out...she was determined that as soon as she hit 18...she was done with you all\n\nYour daughter isn't coming back. YTA here...big time", "Only proving my point you don\u2019t miss your kid.. you miss her being your servant. you gave birth to a kid.. you are responsible for providing for that kid until they are 18.. it was not your daughter\u2019s responsibility to care for her brother. That is your job until he is also 18..\nWhy your daughter left is becoming clear to everyone but you.\n\nI\u2019m glad she is happy now!", "When did she have time to get a part time job when you constantly expected her to babysit?", "You PARENTIFIED your daughter. YTA", "YTA - you forced her to be a maid and a babysitter for your child. Also, if your youngest is 9 then you haven\u2019t been split up with her father for \u201cjust a few years\u201d. Kids are meant to be kids and you destroyed her childhood.", "So a 10 year old was forced to do \u201call the chores\u201d and then watch her brother every single day as a 12 year old AND do all the chores because she fid not have \u201ca part time job\u201d? A 12 YEAR OLD!! Do you even hear yourself? There are awful mothers  on this sub, but you are one of the worst I have seen.", "Ok ..so out of a week, how many hours was your daughter expected to parent your child ?", "I think you make a typo in your story, you wrote \"daughter\" instead of \"personal slave\".", "You\u2019re gross. Hire a babysitter. Take care of your own kid. Sorry your housekeeper quit without notice. I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll be hard for you.", "There it is.", "\u201cshe never got a job so i forced her to do mine, without pay\u201d", "Did she ever want to get a job?", "So you thought it was right to use her as free help because you couldn't be bothered to parent I guess either of your children?", " Look, it's not like giving a kid a few chores are bad, but it sounds like you left all the responsibility of home and family to one of your children who didn't have a say in any of it. To make matters worse, she and your husband have been fighting? You did nothing. What did you think was going to happen after she was no longer legally obligated to put up with it? You never bothered to see her as anything else but an extension of you, but she's now an adult, a person, you can legally do nothing to control her, and your relationship is officially changed. Get on board or leave her alone.", "And she felt it was \u201cright\u201d to leave you ASAP. See how that works?\n\nHow could she have gotten a job if she was babysitting full-time?", "You said she's been helping since he was born in your post which means you expected her to have a part time job or care for a child at 10 years old?..", "You parentified her. She left because, however much childcare you expected from her, it was more than she wanted to give. You have to accept that she has the right to make the choice now", "Be ready for when your son leaves you", "YTA. You didn\u2019t parent your daughter. You used her for free child labour and allowed your new boyfriend to mistreat her. Good luck, I bet she\u2019s never going to talk to you again.", "THE chores \n\nThe majority of them? Ugh. Ugh. You should be ashamed", "SHE WAS 11!!!!!", "Did she have time for that?", "So, you paid her?", "No actually her job was to be a kid and yours was to be the parent.", "I lit her up and deleted the comment when I saw this; this makes sense but still the mom is a weirdo for stalking her kid", "She wrote 9ms so unless she's lying about the age the kid is a baby.", "True,  all the conflicting and missing info is making this really hard and a frustrating read.", "She even has a name for it. The \"buddy system.\"\n\nOf course, only girls get \"buddies.\"", "Well then, I stand corrected.  Her timeline makes it hard to not think she was a cheater.", "Well, I stand corrected. All signs point to Op being a cheater.", "Nor should she.", "She was the maid and the nanny. And I bet the boyfriend didn't treat her well.", "Also idk what country OP is in, but a lot of countries its illegal for a 10, 11, 12, 13yr old to work. In my country you can't legally work until you're 16. Also school IS a full time job for kids. A child not having a full time AND part time (illegal) job doesnt make them available for free labor :/", "If while they are working, then min 50 hours a week.", "Regardless of the answer, she shouldn\u2019t be a third parent. OP and BF needed to be better.", "I doubt it, daughter was 11", "Yeah I felt bad for assuming for like a hot minute then I saw OP's comments. She says her daughter started babysitting when her brother was a toddler, i.e. not a baby. That is unless OP doesn't know the definition of toddler vs baby.", "The daughter left over a year ago. Baby wouldn't have been born yet.  \n\n\nYes, she could have meant that the baby was 9 months at the time of her leaving. But I refer you back to 'you don't build up that kind of resentment in less than a year'.", "OP has said said that the daughter started babysitting when the son was a toddler. Ergo, not 9months old.", "Ah yes. The sister moms", "Bc she\u2019s the other man\u2019s kid. He\u2019s probably happy as hell she\u2019s gone. OP just wants her back so she doesn\u2019t have to raise a kid again", "I ask because I suspect OP prevented her from getting a job, and then said she had to take care of her brother because she didn\u2019t have one. This isn\u2019t about whether it\u2019s ok to parentify (it\u2019s never ok), it\u2019s a question of how far OP went in actively limiting her daughter\u2019s freedom.", "True true,  op is purposely misleading and giving conflicting info.", "Nah, he's probably sad his babysitter is gone. But he'll get used to it faster than mom! She will have to do chores again!", "Agreed with everything you said."]}
