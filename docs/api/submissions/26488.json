He has got bone cancer at 22yo and they had to cut it off to stop from spreading further into his body. He had lived a rough life, understandably, after dealing with chronic depression and shame. But when I met him, he was an extremely happy and positive person and had found peace with his situation. \n\nAnyways, we worked next door to a physical therapy office that had many elderly patients. My coworker didn\u2019t always park in the handicap space because he felt capable of using his crutches and was thoughtful enough to spare the space for others. However, if he was having pains in his leg/phantom leg, he would occasionally use the spot. One day he parks in the spot, and the head PT storms into our store a few hours later and demands to know which one of us parked in the handicap spot. He had disabled and handicapped patients who needed the spot and how dare we abuse the spot! Before I could interject, as I knew the PT fairly well, my coworker jumps up from behind the counter, grabbed his crutches, and said he would move his vehicle. When he came around the corner with only one leg, the PT went white and stammered, frozen in place, trying to back pedal. My coworker moved his car, and the PT just stood in silence staring at me, absolutely mortified! My coworker came back inside and said \u201cmy apologies for abusing the space\u201d.

You wouldn't know to look at her, she can't prove her issue as eaaily. But if she can dislocate her knee walking across her own bedroom, you can imagine her difficulties on moving train or bus! Even when she is strapped up it's usually not visible under a skirt or dress. Also it's not always safe or wise to signal a vulnerability either especially when travelling alone.\n\nWe've had to encourage her to be assertive about her need for a seat and more importantly not giving it up because there are some awful, entitled people out there sadly.", "NTA. There\u2019s a whole subsection of the general public that refuses to believe anyone with an appearance of being under age 30 without a glaringly obvious disability (wheelchair, crutches, obviously missing a limb) is capable of being sick or disabled because they\u2019re young.
