None of you seem to care that the 16yr old is old enough to know what she\u2019s doing, you know that she\u2019s being abusive and you downplay it and allow it. You could possibly make a case for not wanting to parent the grandchild but dude, why are you not ripping your son a new one for allowing such behaviour?

Don't think your grand-daughter is the only drama lover in family. And if she knows how to press all the buttons, maybe she doesn't need to given the ammuniation.", "It is completely your job as a host.   You only treat one side like family.    I've seen that first hand and I guarantee you they are devastated in not having grandparents to that treat them like they want them", "What? No. You're setting her up to fail in the real world.\n\nIn the REAL WORLD, literally EVERYONE can dish out consequences. She says that shit to a cashier, she isn't getting her hamburger. She says that to a classmate, her professor kicks her out of lecture. She says that to her spouse, her spouse leaves her ass. She says that to a friend, she's alone and friendless. She says that to a coworker, she gets fired. She says that to a stranger, she might get punched or even shot.\n\nThe real world gives her consequences. You're sheltering her from the reality that she's about to face a huge fucking ass-whoopin' wakeup call in about two years. Life is gonna slap her in the ass pretty soon.\n\nShe's nearly an adult and still hasn't figured out that when you fuck around, you find out. And the older you get, the more serious the consequences are. She's fucked.", "At your house?? At your table?? NO SIR. You give her parents an opportunity to school her, and if they can\u2019t get her to be civil, you tell them to take her home.", "You\u2019re a failed parent and grandparent and a huge asshole", "Your house.

I also wasn\u2019t bullying adults for their weight at 16. How do you think people grow into adults that act like this? Because they were never told it was wrong. And yes, adults like this do exist. It\u2019s not just teenagers.", "Actually, it's the other way around. Carla is the adopted son's daughter. He \"kicked out\" his biological son's wife.", "You miss my point. When you're a parent of a teen, you'll understand", "I think you\u2019re just raising an asshole.", "I parented two teens who grew into successful well-liked adults.\nI would not have stood by and let them insult their aunt because it\u2019s developmentally appropriate.\nI actually have a career working with teenagers and I can\u2019t imagine any of the sixteen year olds I know behaving in this manner", "When I was a teen, I wouldn\u2019t have dared to be a rude guest.

I hated getting punishments, so I learned to behave.", "Nah, you're just a bad parent", "Oh no, she would've never act that way in public. She only did it at home, the trick was to not respond, or, to answer in very great detail, so that she was uncomfortable. That got the point across better than simply telling her to stop \n\nAnd she grew into an amazing woman.", "This won't be popular, but NTA.\n\nIt doesn't matter what Carla said. Put yourself in Op's place. If Jana demands that you kick out Jana or Carla, the obvious answer is Jana. What right does Jana have to order you to kick somebody out of your own house (especially with no explanation why)? None. Jana effectively volunteered.\n\nGranted, Carla is an AH, here. Still, there were many other ways for Jana to handle this that didn't involve giving orders to the host in his own house.", "YTA you\u2019re condoning your grand daughters bad behaviour", "YTA. \n\nYour grandchild is nearly a grandADULT, and you are still allowing her to button push and shove the social order of your family around.   \nGood on Jana for standing up for herself/her family. It  sounds like it doesn\u2019t matter how rude, obnoxious or devastating Carla is, you will protect her at the expense of Jana/Jana\u2019s family.   \nYou are letting Carla grow into a ~~delightful~~ hellish adult.", "YTA for every reason listed, and then some. Wowzers. People like you make me even more thankful I hit the in-law jackpot with mine. And yeah, Carla is most definitely NOT a sweet kid, she\u2019s a bully, who learned from a bully, who learned from a bully.", "YTA. \n\nBut she\u2019s a sweet kid?!?", "OP, i have no sons/daughters, i just have nephews/nieces, i consider myself the fun uncle.

Because of you, this feud will continue for generations.", "YTA. Don't be surprised when your younger son and his family go no contact with you. I wonder why your son's don't get along? I can make a guess that the older one is the golden child and he can do no wrong, with Carla following in his footsteps. You are allowing Carla to be a bully by not kicking her and her family out.", "YTA \n\nYou KNOW there\u2019s bad blood between your kids and their families.  It\u2019s on you for ignoring it.\n\nI have to wonder what\u2019s wrong with your judgment that you put a bunch of people who hate each other and purposely antagonize each other in the same room.\n\nFrankly, your instigator granddaughter should have been kicked out.  She\u2019s the one who couldn\u2019t help herself from making offensive/obnoxious/hateful comments.", "YTA\n\nCarla sounds nasty and Carla was the instigator. Carla should have been made to apologize or leave.\n\nWhy have you not stepped in and told Carla she doesn't treat YOUR GUESTS that way, in YOUR HOUSE?\n\nGood luck ever seeing your younger son's kids again.", "YTA, you knew your grandkid was looking for trouble and yet you still kicked Jana out.", "NTA. She gave you a choice. You made it. Tbh, if it was me, whoever gave me an ultimatum like this in my own home would be GONE. \n\nNow, if DIL had responded like an adult and had a reasonable conversation about what GD said to her, I would have taken everything into consideration and then decided how to proceed. GD should not automatically be who you side with, honestly.", "YTA for immediately taking Carla's side. \n\nCarla is the AH for instigating the incident. And for using the friction between your sons as an excuse to be cruel.\n\nJana is the AH for demanding you kick someone out of your home. Totally appropriate for her to dismiss herself but to issue an ultimatum to someone else about their home is AH behavior too.\n\nYour wife is AH for favoring the younger son since birth.\n\nOlder son is AH for not putting his daughter in check and offering to leave since his child started the ruckus.", "If you\u2019ve always parented like this then no wonder everyone in your family hates each other \n\nYTA", "YTA-\n\n\"Carla is really a sweet kid\" \n\nIt's not sweet to intentionally make someone upset and mad\n\nYou knew that she'd start something but was punishing the one who Carla was acting up towards????\n\nyou're showing favoritism and being an enabler, makes me wonder who REALLY created the feud if that's how you act during conflict.", "YTA\nIt is very obvious where Carla gets her a-holeness from", "\"My son and their child\"  \n\nLesser grandkid effectively got kicked out.  \n\nGrandma, you're a preferential b.

You know what happens to precious little Carla when she starts shit outside of her family? She\u2019s likely to get punched, thrown in jail or otherwise. \n\nYou and whoever else is enabling her are setting her up for a lifetime of behavioral problems that will drive anyone in her life away.

Not hard to tell why your sons hate each other.  They learned it from you.", "Such a toxic thing to say", "One day your granddaughter will meet her match and get her ass handed to her. It will happen. It will be her own fault.", "GD's behavior was regrettably age appropriate. DIL's was not.  She's a grown up who is expected to suck it up when a child misbehaves.  If it's so egregious as to be impossible to tolerate,  she goes to the child's  PARENTS, not the hostess making demands for something no one but her heard.   I stand by my statement.  One never has any right to demand a hostess remove an invited guest. For all anyone knows,  GD told her she has a booger on her nose.   She knew who was going to be there.  She chose to attend.  And she chose to behave no better than the bratty child.", "Button pusher re: shit stirrer. Shit stirrer, that is the apple of grandma's eye.", "OP admits to knowing exactly what happened (though he claims to only speculate it was about Jana's weight). He was going to intervene before Carla made insults. He watched his granddaughter move seats and whisper an insult into his DIL ear. This was 100% calculated, and he watched it happen. His older son was also at the table and failed to intervene. Probably because the older son is just as bad a parent as OP is. \n\nAt that point, Jana can ignore the insult, ask the host to force the offending party to leave, leave themselves, or start a fight with the offending party. Starting a fight is a clear AH move, which Jana didn't do. Jana laid out the two options acceptable to her, which are the only options between ignoring and fighting. OP expected her to ignore it. Why should she and how does not ignoring the insult make her an AH? Few people want to be at their ILs to begin with. Who wants to be insulted by some brat on top of that.\n\nSo no, Jana is not an AH. OP has a clear favorite son and sides with his bully grandchild, making him the clear AH. Jana handled the situation with her only non-AH options.", "Had someone like yours at my last workplace. She caused trouble with everyone, one at a time, our boss had some kind of friendship with her so nothing ever happened when we tried to address her behaviour. Funnily enough it was her not wanting to be vaccinated that made her leave.", "You sound like a truly awful human being. So glad you are no family member of mine. I hope your son, DIL, and \"their child\" go no contact.. that's the least you deserve for how you've treated them. Disgusting.", "I think you do.
