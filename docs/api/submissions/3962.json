{"id": 3962, "submission_id": "zcm9pj", "title": "AITA for making a scene when my son refused to dance with me?", "selftext": "This all started when my son Ben graduated high school. There was a formal dance. I was very excited for the mother-son dance. Every time I brought it up, Ben would say he wasn't going to dance. I didn't take him seriously. I thought he was just being shy.\n\nWhen we got to the formal, everything was beautiful. But when it came time for the formal dances, he was nowhere to be seen. I approached my older daughter, Alice, and my husband, who I could see were talking and laughing. I asked if they'd seen Ben, and they laughed and said he was going to go hide so he didn't have to dance. I was absolutely heart broken. My son was literally hiding from me! I stood in the corner during the mother-son dance, watching all his friends dance with their moms. I couldn't take it, so I told my husband and daughter that I was walking home.\n\nWhen they got home, Ben walked right past me and went to his room to get ready for the after party. My daughter hugged me, and went to get ready, because she was driving Ben to the party. After our children left, my husband and I had an argument about what happened. He said he was appalled at my behaviour, and that I was acting like a child. I said that the least Ben could have done was dance with his mother. He said that today was supposed to be about him and his accomplishment, not me. But in my opinion, today should have also been about celebrating the people who helped him get to where he is now. Things got quite heated, and before going inside, my husband said that he wasn't going to force his son to do something he didn't want to do on his day.\n\nI was taken aback by this, so I just stayed on the porch trying not to cry. I thought my husband would support me. Later, my daughter returns home and sees me crying. She gives me a hug and gave me a chocolate bar to try to cheer me up. If no one else, my daughter would be on my side. She danced with me at her graduation. She danced with her father. She understood how important this day was for me. I asked if she was on my side. She said something along the lines of \"I know you're upset, but I don't know what you expected from him\".\n\nIt took a few days before we really spoke to each other again, and after a few weeks, everything went back to normal.\n\nComing back to the present, my daughter recently got engaged. We were talking about it on a family facetime, and the topic of when Ben will get married came up. He said he was never going to get married, because he doesn't want to deal with another round of dance drama. When I asked him to clarify, he said that he was obviously referring to his graduation.\n\nI was appalled at this attack. He won\u2019t get married because of me? I won't lie, I am upset that he still does not want to dance with me, even at his own wedding. Now my husband is mad at me, my son refuses to answer my calls or texts.\n\nAITA for making a scene and starting an argument because my son never wants to dance with me?  \n\n\nEDIT: Okay, it appears as though the response is pretty unanimous, and I have a lot of thinking to do.", "created_utc": 1670189244, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcm9pj/aita_for_making_a_scene_when_my_son_refused_to/", "score": 1302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The writing was on the wall with that one.

There was a formal dance. I was very excited for the mother-son dance. Every time I brought it up, Ben would say he wasn't going to dance. I didn't take him seriously. I thought he was just being shy.\n\nWhen we got to the formal, everything was beautiful. But when it came time for the formal dances, he was nowhere to be seen. I approached my older daughter, Alice, and my husband, who I could see were talking and laughing. I asked if they'd seen Ben, and they laughed and said he was going to go hide so he didn't have to dance. I was absolutely heart broken. My son was literally hiding from me! I stood in the corner during the mother-son dance, watching all his friends dance with their moms. I couldn't take it, so I told my husband and daughter that I was walking home. \n\nWhen they got home, Ben walked right past me and went to his room to get ready for the after party. My daughter hugged me, and went to get ready, because she was driving Ben to the party. After our children left, my husband and I had an argument about what happened. He said he was appalled at my behaviour, and that I was acting like a child. I said that the least Ben could have done was dance with his mother. He said that today was supposed to be about him and his accomplishment, not me. But in my opinion, today should have also been about celebrating the people who helped him get to where he is now. Things got quite heated, and before going inside, my husband said that he wasn't going to force his son to do something he didn't want to do on his day.\n\nI was taken aback by this, so I just stayed on the porch trying not to cry. I thought my husband would support me. Later, my daughter returns home and sees me crying. She gives me a hug and gave me a chocolate bar to try to cheer me up. If no one else, my daughter would be on my side. She danced with me at her graduation. She danced with her father. She understood how important this day was for me. I asked if she was on my side. She said something along the lines of \"I know you're upset, but I don't know what you expected from him\". \n\nIt took a few days before we really spoke to each other again, and after a few weeks, everything went back to normal.\n\nComing back to the present, my daughter recently got engaged. We were talking about it on a family facetime, and the topic of when Ben will get married came up. He said he was never going to get married, because he doesn't want to deal with another round of dance drama. When I asked him to clarify, he said that he was obviously referring to his graduation.\n\nI was appalled at this attack. He won\u2019t get married because of me? I won't lie, I am upset that he still does not want to dance with me, even at his own wedding. Now my husband is mad at me, my son refuses to answer my calls or texts.\n\nAITA for making a scene and starting an argument because my son never wants to dance with me?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your wants don't override your child's comfort levels, especially at an event that's about them.

Something important to you isn\u2019t important to your son. That can hurt especially when you feel as if everyone else is demeaning you for being disappointed.\n\nBut your son is also a different person than you. Your relationship is unique to you two and it seems that you\u2019re more keen on sharing a milestone rather than an experience together. He told you what he wanted and you diminished his desires yourself by expecting them to change. He\u2019s a different person and relationships are a two way streets. What he wants matters to, he doesn\u2019t like dancing. By him hiding from you, it seems that you would or have forced him in the past to do things he finds enjoyable. He graduated high school, he\u2019s becoming an adult and you can\u2019t really force adults to do things they don\u2019t want.\n\nYou were not blindsided or lead to believe that you would have an experience different than what he told you. I get the disappointment but as a mother you have to accept who your children are. My advice is to not try to take it personally, which I get is hard, because if you don\u2019t you may wake up one day and he refuses to interact with you. \n\nYou\u2019re not TA for feeling, YTA for not accepting your son\u2019s own wants and then complaining that he\u2019s ignoring yours.

Let me tell you something though OP. My mother, is the god damn same as you. Every event was her way. When my brother had his first baby, him and his partner were home all of 10 minutes before she was knocking and shouting at the door to see the kid and this was after explicitly being told that the birth was tough and his partner wanted a day or two before people went over. I\u2019m 33, my first wedding was all HER choices. She went to everything with my ex wife and planned the whole wedding. The only thing I picked was the shoes I wore with my suit. I\u2019m getting married again in May next year. Me, my girl and her two kids are going to the other end of England in secret to get married so we don\u2019t have to deal with that. I love my mum, but I can\u2019t let her be a part of my life events because they all become about her. Whatever you do, show your son that you can be better before the damage is forever", "I don\u2019t think you were wrong for being upset over him not wanting  to dance with you \n\nBut everything you said and did afterwards makes YTA \n\nApologise to him for being self centred and making it all about you without making it all about you", "YTA. You sound like a total diva/drama queen. It's pretty sad he couldn't enjoy his graduation dance because you were so hyper focused about dancing with him. Him having to hide from you is pretty telling. I am super embarrassed having to dance in front of people, so I don't. None of my family ever made it an issue. I would be *mortified* if my mom acted this way. Then your daughter (who sounds so sweet) has to try to cheer you up and console you because you're crying about it. Maybe it's just me but this doesn't seem normal at all. Being disappointed is one thing. Leaving and walking home, having a fight about this with your husband that gets heated and your daughter having to console you is a huge overreaction to being disappointed. I'm sure you have some great qualities but you sound exhausting to be around if you don't get your way. It's not good that your daughter essentially expected how you'd act and brought you chocolate to cheer you up. Are your meltdowns so common she knows she \"has\" to come cheer you up? I don't blame your son for his comment. He's being honest. I wouldn't want you at any major functions in my life because I would be worried you'd meltdown. I'd also worry you'd make it all about you. \n\nIf I was you, I'd apologize profusely, do some soul searching and get some therapy. Sorry if this sounds harsh but I'm not sure if the people in your life will tell it to you straight or if they're worried about managing your emotions so they can't tell you how terrible this sounds to deal with.", "Good lord YTA!", "You sound like my mom so I can relate to your kid... for what everyone else already mentioned YTA.", "\u201cThe least he could do is dance with his mother.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo the bare minimum he could do was exactly what he didn\u2019t want to do and the thing you alone wanted to do?\n\n\nYou are incredibly immature and absolutely an AH.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\never considered maybe he genuinely doesnt like dancing? or simply doesnt want to dance with you, which also is fine \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nway to hold onto this ruin his achievements", "You sound like my MIL. \n\nShe has two adult sons and one has gone no-conact and the other is very low, soon to be no-contact.

He's at that phase where he's trying to branch off, do his own thing, say whatever he can to establish his own independence, and escape the shadow of his mother. I'm sure you went through a similar phase with your parents. Have you stopped to think about why this hurt so much knowing all of the above? Maybe he's your youngest and he's growing up and it hurts? Maybe you're afraid to lose him because he's the last one in the nest?", "YTA, but what I find saddest is the lack of empathy for your son.

But he didn\u2019t want to dance and that should\u2019ve been accepted even if it hurt you. Being a mother sometimes means burying our hurt feelings so we can continue to cheer on our children. To encourage them to be their own ppl and succeed in life. \n\nIf you don\u2019t wish to continue to damage your relationships with your children, it\u2019s time to put on your mom smile and bury that hurt.

The dance, the not wanting to get married, or be around you, that screams that your behavior towards him was not good, and could be a bit of where you were pressuring him in ways that was uncomfortable for him.  That he did not want you around, did not want to be anywhere near you and ultimately failed to see that when he needed to the support such as just praise you made it all about yourself.  \n\nWhen you stop putting yourself first in the life of your son and putting him first in his life, he may decide to have a second look at the relationship, but the way you went on and then mentioned marriage to him, says alot and it is not good.  To make your own son look at something like marriage says that you really messed him up, especially if he has check out of the relationship with you.  \n\nIf he ever gets married, or has a child, chances are he will not tell you, or invite you and how you deal with that will determine if it will be justification in his mind about not including you or not.", "There are huge gaps of information missing here.
