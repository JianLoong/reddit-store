If she had given you the $100 you asked her for when she got the first half of the payment from the FB guy, there would never have been a problem.  She really does seem to believe that what's yours is hers.", "Another option - get the balance of 400 from the man buying it when you sign the papers.  Then you and mother have half the price each, if she is not happy too bad - and the car is gone.", "NTA but court isn't the route to go.  Just refuse to sign the title until your mother sticks to the deal.  She has to cave at some point.", "NTA. It's a more than fair deal and why she should balk at that is nuts.", "INFO - where is the car now?  I'm going to guess that the buyer has already taken possession of the vehicle and is driving it.", "Nta", "NTA.  Given the new information about your relationship, you're definitely NTA.  You're not asking for much, and it sounds like you've already gone above and beyond.\n\n~~E S H.  Ask yourself if $100 that you say you don't need is worth totally destroying your relationship with your mother.  Yes, it sucks that she's being an ass, but you're being one as well.~~", "NTA, but I'd strongly consider just calling it a loss and signing the title. Sounds like the relationship between you and your mother is already strained and I don't know if it's worth the money to fight this. You already know that you're right. Personally I'd probably write it off as a loss and try to salvage any worthwhile relationship that you have. And if it doesn't work out, then at least you were the bigger person.", "Why didn\u2019t you outright give the car to your mother when her car was totaled? It makes no sense to keep it in your name and be responsible for accidents/damage. Unless you have some big grudge against your mother, what was the $100 about?\n\nI am not saying her deception in selling it was right, just not understanding your initial actions.", "ESH.  This has to be the dumbest hill to die on ever.  Your mom cosigned for the car years back to get you started, you don't care about it any more, but you're still going to hold her up for $100?  Yes she's the AH also for trying to sell your car behind your back, no matter how unreasonable you're being, but escalating to small claims?  This incident speaks volumes about the relationship between the two of you.  Don't you think it's time for both of you to grow up?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
