We dated for 7 years from 20-27. The breakup was a shit show and then we didn\u2019t talk for like a year, but we ran into each other again a few months back and we\u2019ve been sorta becoming friends again. \n\nMy gf now \u201cJulie\u201d (27f) doesn\u2019t like me being friends with Bianca. She thinks it\u2019s weird we\u2019re friends. Ig I can\u2019t really summarize how big of a shitshow our breakup was. All my friends told Julie about it. She was really upset when I told her I met Bianca again. I try to be honest bc that was a big tension point in my last relationship so I told Julie that Bianca was my first time really being in love with someone but that I\u2019m with her now and she shouldn\u2019t worry. \n\nA few days ago I was leaving work and going to dinner at Julie\u2019s mom\u2019s when Bianca called. She said she was sorry for bothering me but her car broke down about a half a mile from my office and she wanted to know if I could pick her up bc no one else was answering. I said I would and I went over. She was smoking (which she only does when she\u2019s really upset) and she said she didn\u2019t know what happened. I took a look, told her what happened and we waited for roadside assistance to get the car. I was running kinda late for dinner so I texted Julie saying I\u2019d be late.\n\n\nI drove Bianca home and she tried to offer me money for gas when we got there, but I told her no and it was the least I could do. She thanked me said she\u2019d get me coffee or something to pay me back bc she\u2019s stubborn, then she left. \n\nDinner was good but after Julie asked what happened. I told her and she was really upset. She said she thought it was weird and was annoyed that I\u2019d blow her off for my ex girlfriend. I told her she was being ridiculous, I was just being nice, but she started crying and she stormed off. \n\nWe still haven\u2019t really talked about it and I feel kind of like a dick. But also like wtf? Bianca meant a lot to me for a long time and we were friends for two years before we dated. I\u2019m dating Julie now and she\u2019s acting real insecure for no reason.

What's wrong with forgiving an ex and moving on? My ex always tried to keep me in his life after we broke up and I always thought it was weird because I would feel uncomfortable on the other end as his gf. Eventually had to block him. I get that some women would be okay with this, but in general, there's nothing wrong with your gf feeling a type of way about it and wanting you to set boundaries. It seems like your ex wants attention from a man.", "INFO\n\nHad your ex already called roadside assistance and got a timeline?\n\nHow late were you for your girlfriend...and her family?\n\nAnd how much of that was staying AFTER establishing your ex was in one piece, and roadside assistance was on the way?\n\nIE did you turn 10 minutes into an hour by shooting the breeze with your ex who had help on the way anyway?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe you see where I am going here.... unless this is a gangland you live in or bears roam freely, sounds like your ex could have just locked herself in the car or walked somewhere (you say its half mile from your office!) rather than needing you to wait up.", "YTA. It's not just about helping the ex, it's also that you stood your gf up in front of her mum. As for the ex, you need a ride home - you call for an Uber or taxi or what have you.

You did nothing wrong by helping out, but your GF is insecure about your contact with ex, and needs reassurance (for some folks no amount of reassurance will do). It\u2019s tough to do what you feel is right thing, when your GF is running scenarios in her head, and you being the choice of exes mom isn\u2019t going to help present  GF\u2019s insecurity (btw-many folks would be insecure in this situation)", "You\u2019re TA bro. How would you feel if she got in contact with her ex to pick her up if she broke down? And you\u2019re gf doesn\u2019t know the extent to which you guys are cool, I mean y\u2019all dated for 7 years, that\u2019s a long relationship, with a lot of close memories and feelings towards another girl you\u2019re asking your current gf to be cool with. You\u2019re introducing unneeded doubt in your relationship that isn\u2019t fair. No matter how much you reassure her everything is okay, it\u2019s only natural for doubt, insecurity, and thoughts of unfaithfulness to creep in. You\u2019re asking a lot for your gf here that ain\u2019t fair", "YTA\n\nYou do you but I give your relationship till the end of the week with the shit you\u2019re pulling.", "YTA", "NTA\n\nPrevious romantic relationships have nothing to do with current friendships. Seems like your current GF has trust issues to work on.", "YTA. I don\u2019t see your relationship lasting much longer and you end up dating Bianca again:/", "YTA\u2014-So you were late to a dinner with your actual GF\u2019s family  bc you decided to stop and help your EX GF , that you dated for 7 years and a horrible toxic brake up with but you don\u2019t see why Julie would be upset and hurt by your actions?", "YTA \n\nThere's that aura of bullshit surrounding every justification here. Leave the poor girl alone and figure your shit out.", "Unpopular opinion but - ESH. You ditched your current girlfriend for an ex who could have easily called road service, and it was a dinner at Julie's mom's house too. You should have politely explained you couldn't make it, and suggested another friend or service to help her. At the same time, Julie could be more understanding of the situation and likely just flipped out because she was already embarrassed by you 'blowing her off' at her parent's house, and because Bianca was the reason you did so just made it sting even further. IMO, ESH and just needs to have a conversation about clear strict boundaries.", "NAH \u2014 hear me out:\n\nI think you both have valid positions, but neither of you are going about it properly.\n\nOn one hand, a 7 year relationship is a huge amount of time!  It is completely fair and reasonable to be a cordial and friendly adult to someone you spent nearly a third of your life with. \n\nOn the other hand, a 7 year relationship is a *really* huge amount of time!  I can very, very easily understand her jealousy.\n\nAnd, in consideration of my prior paragraph: Dude \u2014 that\u2019s a really stupid move to delay dinner with your gf\u2019s mom to do a friend (regardless of who it was!) a favor. That\u2019s when you say \u201chey, really sorry, I have an important obligation.\u201d\n\nIn complete honesty, I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t share her feelings if I were in a similar situation.\n\nThat said, you did something nice for an ex.  It was stupid outside of context, and stupider with context \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.  You have been open and honest about your feelings and intentions and you haven\u2019t cheated \u2014 if she doesn\u2019t agree with your motives, she is a grown woman who is free to make a decision about staying or leaving.", "NTA - but, you and your gf need to talk about boundaries and expectations! There's no way either of you could know what the other's perceived rules were on contact with exes unless you've actually talked about it and set rules.\n\nThat said, maybe it's that I'm poly but I can't super relate to being mad about contacting an ex, even when I was monogamous it just wasn't a big deal!", "NTA only cause you were helping out a friend. Yes she is an ex but she is also a friend. Her car broke down. I'd say that is a good enough excuse to be late for dinner. It isn't like you got invited to drink or smoke and you blew of your gf. You were helping someone with a rather decent problem that could not really wait.\n\nYou are also being very honest by telling your gf everything.", "YTA.\n\n Your previous relationship ended in a shitshow, and I would not he surprised if your current one also ends in a shitshow.\n\n\nThis is not about someone helping...\nYou left a dinner with your current partner to help your ex while she could have called road assistance by herself... Waited by herself... And take care of it by herself.\n\nShe is an adult and you don't have to drop everything straight away to help her.\n\nIt probably would have been way better to say, I have a dinner with my partner and her mother. I can't pick you up atm.\n\n\nI honestly don't believe she tried to call other people. I think she called you straight away. That she still has some feelings for you... Maybe not love as before, but certainly some feelings...", "YTA. You should have told your GF what you were going to do. You withheld information and then gaslighted her. N.t.a. for helping the ex though. But you conflagrate both things in your post.", "YTA. Your ex didn\u2019t have a life or death situation. You CHOSE to go to her over your own girlfriend. You are not the only person in this planet who could have helped her when her car broke down.", "Dump both of them. Bianca was a 'shitshow' so stay away from her before you get stuck with her. There is another shitshow coming your way if you don't stay away. Julie is an insecure little kid who will just get worse over time. Save yourself. The insecurity will become accusations of infidelity and your life will be a living hell. No one is worth constant accusations of you being a cheater when you are not.", "Yta only because you know that staying close to this ex is a problem for your gf. it's not that you helped out a friend in an emergency. It's that you picked helping your ex instead of being with your GF. Helping your ex who could have found someone else to help her. Your gf isn't crazy. She knows there are still feelings therem it's why your ex called you. So, decide now, your gf, or your ex. You can't have both. (And this is coming from a married women who is friends with my exes and my husband's exes.). Guess what, we stay away from exes that make the other insecure. Insecure feelings can mean 2 things. 1 work on your issues.  2 red flag, problem... I'm guessing the insecurity is not insecurity but her picking up on this being a threat to your relationship.", "Some people like to make amends with their exes. Personally, I don't try to stay friends with exes but I also wouldn't completely block them from my life either. I have a few on facebook and if I ran into them in public it wouldn't be weird. Some people don't create enemies out of their exes.", "She called roadside assistance who told her they\u2019d be there in 45 minutes or something like that. It was already kinda dark and she said she\u2019d already called her sister, her mom, and a friend and no one picked up. And I wasn\u2019t super late only like thirty minutes or so. I mean most of it was me driving her back but I wasn\u2019t gonna leave her to find a ride or go with roadside assistance. I\u2019d have worried. I\u2019d rather drop her off myself knowing she\u2019s safe and in one piece", "Genuinely can you explain?\n\nWould it have been okay if the friend having an emergency wasn't an ex partner?", "He\u2019s TA and the gf has every right to be mad but holy shit people on Reddit with these relationship posts throw around \u201cbreak up\u201d like it\u2019s nothing", "Sorry I would say YTA then.\n\nShe could have easily locked herself in her car and waited 30-40 minutes.  This wasn't a situation where she was in danger or hurt, and she had a working phone to reach emergency services or try other people.\n\nThis just sounded like she wanted company bc she was upset over the car.", "A partner of seven years with a bad break up. You didn\u2019t talk for a year. Leave it that way. You look messy dude.", "You\u2019re not wrong but I also didn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m saying she\u2019s gonna leave him.", "Fact that\u2019s my bad idk how I read that, you didn\u2019t say that and you are right, if shit like this continues that could very well be a week kinda resolution. My bad on reading that wrong that\u2019s on me"]}
