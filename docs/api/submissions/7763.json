So if he's got a service dog that helps him with his disability and you've got a disability that requires the absence of a dog, and the gym (Or a store, airline, school, office, whatever...) is legally required to accommodate people with disabilities, do they allow the dog (to accommodate him) or ban the dog (to accommodate you)?

I.E. if a gym supervisor had to intervene legally it's likely that if there was an available alternative machine one could use then that person would be asked to accommodate the other, or otherwise take turns and wait for staff members to clean an area.

OP said husky so thats what im going off of. Both are very sweet animals that is about the end of the similarities. A pet husky is like a hyper child that is on the spectrum, they will sing, run, be dogs. A well trained service husky will act the way described by OP.
