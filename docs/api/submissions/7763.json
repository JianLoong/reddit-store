The world does  not revolve around you.", "YTA for swearing at him, but I honestly wonder... under the ADA, a severe allergy can be considered a disability.  So if he's got a service dog that helps him with his disability and you've got a disability that requires the absence of a dog, and the gym (Or a store, airline, school, office, whatever...) is legally required to accommodate people with disabilities, do they allow the dog (to accommodate him) or ban the dog (to accommodate you)?  Seems like whichever way they go, someone's not getting accommodated.  \n\n\nIn the case of a gym, it's easy to say that you two should just be there at different times, but my question is bigger than that- what if you two are both signed up for the same class, or on the same flight, or applying for jobs in the same office?  \n\n\nDoes anybody know if there's a hierarchy of disability accommodations, where \"Seeing eye dog\" trumps \"dog allergy?\"", "NTA\n\nSo many people just get those fake service dog vests and take their dogs everywhere.

His dog attacked and killed someone's actual service dog. \n\nYou probably would've gotten a better reaction if you hadn't opened with \"Goddammit\" but I get your frustration. People are taking advantage. \n\nAnd I love dogs.", "NAH:   Truthfully I don't think you're an asshole for the \"God dammit\" or the \"he sucks\".
