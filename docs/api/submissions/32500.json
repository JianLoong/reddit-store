I have a job and I have been helping them by paying rent and buying groceries. \n\nMy brother is married and has two children, a two year old and a newborn. He recently lost his job and has asked my parents if he can move back in until he is back on his feet. \n\nMy parents told me that I would need to move out of the basement suite in the house and into my mom's hobby room while my brother and his family stay with them. I did not agree and they said it was their house and their rules. \n\nI don't really own a lot of stuff. Everything  in the suite belongs to them. I don't even own my bed. I packed up my clothes and my laptop and I went to work like usual. I work out of town for 14 days then I get 7 days off. While I was at work I booked an all inclusive for my week off. It cost me less than rent and food at my parents house. I told my parents my plans and they were cool with it. \n\nI started getting texts a few days ago asking where my rent and grocery money was. I said that I moved out. That if I wasn't loving there and eating there I wasn't going to be giving them money. \n\nThey got really upset because they were counting on the money to help support my brother. They said that I moved out without giving notice. I said that they LITERALLY gave away my living space and that I didn't owe them anything if I wasn't there. I asked them how much they are charging my brother.  I was giving them $1,800 a month (Canadian money) for rent and food and I was only home a maximum of 14 days a month. Usually less. \n\nMy brother called me to say I was an ass for not helping him out. I pointed out that he hadn't sent our parents money when he was employed. He said that he had a family to support so he needed his money. He said if I came back he and his family would move upstairs and I could have my space back. \n\nI had actually done the math though. I can stay at all inclusives which cover my room, maid service, food, alcohol, and entertainment for 2/3 of what I was paying my folks. And I don't have to live through Edmonton winters when I'm not working. \n\nI sent my parents $500 to help them with groceries then I went to the beach. \n\nMy parents, my brother, his wife, and a fair few of my other relatives are saying that I'm an asshole for abandoning them on a time of need. \n\nI think if I'm not there I shouldn't have to pay anything. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701922121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cn25s/aita_for_moving_out_after_my_parents_told_me_to/", "score": 703, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You make an excellent point about how your brother wasn't sending your parents money when he was employed. That makes it doubly clear that your payment was for rent and food, not just because. \n\nHonestly, I think it's healthier for you to be on your own anyway. It's natural for children to become more independent as they mature.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t agree to subsidize your entire family on your salary while you stayed in a tiny hobby room.  Food too?

You found a new space. They dont get the income if their not providing the rented space. The fact that they charged you rent and not your brother is telling. It tells you that they think less of you than your brother.  Also, the fact that they still feel you own them says a lot about their thinking in the future.  Their going to at somepoint say you need to take care of them when their older. They will think of you as an ATM/Bank if you dont set boundaries.  Now that you're out, start setting boundaries.

Don't argue with them or extended family. If you'd like, I'd consider making *one* general post or text somewhere outlining that you are a grown woman choosing to make the decisions about your own budget and living situation as you are entitled to do. That the lack of respect and consideration you have received has been appalling, and that if your family wants to be so upset at you, perhaps they should have acted with some common decency and checked their entitlement at the door when making this ridiculous request of you. That you *will not* be discussing this matter further and to any one who considers continuing this needless drama with you will be blocked, and that you will be taking a break in general (if you want) from them to give them the opportunity to reflect and readdress their poor behavior as the family as a whole have been acting shamefully towards you.\n\nPop that puppy off, set do not disturb, block the shit stirrers as they will undoubtedly out themselves if they hair trigger respond.

Either you were a tenant who needs to give notice, but they can\u2019t just give away the space you\u2019re renting. Or you were just helping them out and are free to up and leave whenever you want. They all sound incredibly entitled. I would not cave to their demands.", "NTA; they can\u2019t have it both ways. If you pay rent, you get a say in household matters. They denied you any say at all, but still expected your money. I would ask people giving you shit if they would continue to pay rent if they were kicked out of the place they rented.

It was very generous of you to send them $500 when you had no obligation to do so.", "NTA - Parents cannot seem to accept that when adult children are living at home and contributing to the household, they cannot be treated like young children.  I can certainly understand why they want the basement suite for your brother and family, but I gather that it never occurred to them that you, being a self-supporting adult, could decide to leave if your living situation changed so radically, and obviously they thought that you would pay the same for a single room, and one that you had to share with your mother and her hobbies.  They thought that they could get away with \"our house, our rules.\"  Astonishing, and yet so common.  Enjoy your new life, your new freedom, and your increase in discretionary money!", "NTA.  There seems to be a rash of parents who think their children who are helping with expenses and chores should just act like they are 12 years old and move into a bunk bed situation when siblings with families (read GRANDCHILDREN) suddenly can't afford to support themselves anymore and need to move in but don't have any intention of contributing to the household coffers, just draining them even faster.  Honestly, I think you were overly generous to send them $500 - I wouldn't have.  And now you don't have to take anyone else's needs or schedules into account.

And unless you had a contract or something I can't see why you'd be *obliged* to pay anything at all, let alone stay and continue supporting them.\n\nThat said, it was kind of a dick move to leave with zero notice.

You're not paying $1,800 for a basement suite that your parents already own, and you're not doing it without some sort of paperwork.  Not when you can have a two bedroom suite averagine at $1,300.  A single person buying groceries is about $400 unless you're eating all mass produced crap.  You're saying you're paying $2,300 a month in edmonton as a single person before bills when you could be paying literally half that.\n\nThis situation is either a joke, or so ridiculous that you're all idiots.\n\nAnd if this is real, you're saying you're being kicked out without notice- okay, so where's your paperwork? Oh right.  You'd have to face the reality of the ridiculousness of the cost then.  So there is none.  Which means you just happen to live in your parents basement at nearly 30 with no paperwork in place, paying double what you should be to live (in this economomy, no less).  So you're not being kicked out without notice.  You're just being asked to move to a room, instead of half a house, for your sibling and their entire family as help.

First $$ and they also did storage for my stuff (they even kept food and fridge items for me) after a few months they knew I was always coming back and just let me keep the suite even when I wasn\u2019t there for the 4 night rate.
