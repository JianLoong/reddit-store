He recently lost his job and has asked my parents if he can move back in until he is back on his feet. \n\nMy parents told me that I would need to move out of the basement suite in the house and into my mom's hobby room while my brother and his family stay with them. I did not agree and they said it was their house and their rules. \n\nI don't really own a lot of stuff. Everything  in the suite belongs to them. I don't even own my bed. I packed up my clothes and my laptop and I went to work like usual. I work out of town for 14 days then I get 7 days off. While I was at work I booked an all inclusive for my week off. It cost me less than rent and food at my parents house. I told my parents my plans and they were cool with it. \n\nI started getting texts a few days ago asking where my rent and grocery money was. I said that I moved out. That if I wasn't loving there and eating there I wasn't going to be giving them money. \n\nThey got really upset because they were counting on the money to help support my brother. They said that I moved out without giving notice. I said that they LITERALLY gave away my living space and that I didn't owe them anything if I wasn't there. I asked them how much they are charging my brother.  I was giving them $1,800 a month (Canadian money) for rent and food and I was only home a maximum of 14 days a month. Usually less. \n\nMy brother called me to say I was an ass for not helping him out. I pointed out that he hadn't sent our parents money when he was employed. He said that he had a family to support so he needed his money. He said if I came back he and his family would move upstairs and I could have my space back. \n\nI had actually done the math though. I can stay at all inclusives which cover my room, maid service, food, alcohol, and entertainment for 2/3 of what I was paying my folks. And I don't have to live through Edmonton winters when I'm not working. \n\nI sent my parents $500 to help them with groceries then I went to the beach. \n\nMy parents, my brother, his wife, and a fair few of my other relatives are saying that I'm an asshole for abandoning them on a time of need. \n\nI think if I'm not there I shouldn't have to pay anything. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701922121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cn25s/aita_for_moving_out_after_my_parents_told_me_to/", "score": 2546, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You make an excellent point about how your brother wasn't sending your parents money when he was employed.

It's natural for children to become more independent as they mature.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t agree to subsidize your entire family on your salary while you stayed in a tiny hobby room.  Food too?

You found a new space. They dont get the income if their not providing the rented space. The fact that they charged you rent and not your brother is telling. It tells you that they think less of you than your brother.  Also, the fact that they still feel you own them says a lot about their thinking in the future.  Their going to at somepoint say you need to take care of them when their older. They will think of you as an ATM/Bank if you dont set boundaries.  Now that you're out, start setting boundaries.

Don't argue with them or extended family. If you'd like, I'd consider making *one* general post or text somewhere outlining that you are a grown woman choosing to make the decisions about your own budget and living situation as you are entitled to do. That the lack of respect and consideration you have received has been appalling, and that if your family wants to be so upset at you, perhaps they should have acted with some common decency and checked their entitlement at the door when making this ridiculous request of you. That you *will not* be discussing this matter further and to any one who considers continuing this needless drama with you will be blocked, and that you will be taking a break in general (if you want) from them to give them the opportunity to reflect and readdress their poor behavior as the family as a whole have been acting shamefully towards you.\n\nPop that puppy off, set do not disturb, block the shit stirrers as they will undoubtedly out themselves if they hair trigger respond.
