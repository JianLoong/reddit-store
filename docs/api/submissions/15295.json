They also witnessed her mentally torment me because she used to kick and bang on my door so hard that the hinges flew off and scream abuse erratically then record me while im screaming and crying while having an absolute meltdown. They don\u2019t know the details but they definitely witnessed her treat me like crap and they didn\u2019t care opting out to blame my dad.

I kinda recognized the colorism where there were kids in the family that were worse behaved than i was but i was mainly the target because im tanned.
