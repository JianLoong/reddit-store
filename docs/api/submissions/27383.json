Honestly, you look like an ah for saying that. \n\nI don't think your father is a bad person, I have the opposite impression, and he also wants to fix his relationship with you. You are not the AH for expressing how you feel, but Jesus cut your father some slack, what he did was heroic. Sad that you had to pay a price in that, but that's life.
