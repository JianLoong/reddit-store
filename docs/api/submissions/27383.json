As a result, neither of you are wrong to feel the way you do because, broadly speaking on an impartial societal level, neither decision is right nor wrong. Sacrifices often need to be made within a complex society of humans. \n\nBut it doesn't take away from you're right to be upset or resentful of the fact that he chose to make YOU the casualty. He (and others) may think it's selfish of you to feel that way, and it's a noble thing to sacrifice to save two women from a life of abuse and harassment. But it caused you deep hardship outside of your control during formative years. And that is absolutely unfair.\n\nBut as to whether it was worth it is not for you to decide. Of course for you it's not worth it. But it may have been for your dad. Whether it's out of genuine love, or for self-image reasons, he found worth in his choice. Else, he wouldn't have done it. \n\nBut that isn't to say he has also understood the consequences of his choice. And him trying to fix his relationship with you may be him now trying to undo the fact he ran the trolley of life over your body, unable to face that you did not share his feelings on making the sacrifice.\n\nHe needs to make peace with this, as do you. Only then can you both genuinely rebuild a relationship, that is, if you want to.", "Big NTA \nGuys like your dad started blaming and yelling after the therapist session is over because they don't want to embarrass themselves during the session knowing that the therapist would judge them.", "NTA\n\nShe isn't your baby sister. His hero complex pushing him to save her ended throwing you both on the proverbial sword for them.", "NTA.\n\nThe think about therapy is you shouldn't always expect it to tickle.\n\nHe wanted to bring you around, not change himself.  \n\nGood luck.", "Nta!! And tell that she\u2019s not your sister.", "Why couldn't you have a friend over? It go to their house? That seems very odd to me.  Did you have to watch Katie when home? Where both dad and Gwen working and needed you to care for katie? \n\nI'm guessing that your dad was hoping the therapist would tell you that you should move back home with him.\n\nThe time for your dad to say this words to you were in therapy.  That is what therapy is for,  to talk in a safe place. Not be ambushed you like that. \n\nDefinitely tell your therapist what your dad said.  Tell grandparents too.\n\nYou are allowed to your feelings and anyone week tells you differently,  don't believe them.  You don't feel like Gwen is your mom any more then you feel Katie is your sister. Gwen for causing the upheaval in your life and katie because the age gap.\n\nYou didn't call them horrible names.  Didn't say you hate them. You said your dad was putting their welfare before your own and you're his biological child. None of what you said is cruel.\n\nIf anyone is cruel, its your dad. He did ignore your needs.  He did want to play the roll of White Knight for Gwen. \n\nEach school has a different schedule for what they teach. Being uprooted to multiple schools can have a negative impact on your education.  Not to mention  mentally and emotionally.  Hard to make friends when constantly moving.\n\nYou are    NTA   not even close to being one. \n\nYou're in high school.  Work hard in school and build a future for yourself. \n\nYour grandparents are great, let them keep loving you and protecting you.", "NTA. Your father is a huge coward.", "NTA.  \nHe asked. Hearing the ugly truth can hurt ... that's not on you.", "He is toxic. Cut him off and you will thrive.", "NTA.  Your dad said he wanted to do therapy with you, but he really doesn't.  He wants things to be okay between you, but he is not able to listen to an accept your feelings and your truth.     It is not okay for him to get mad at you  and call your \"cruel\" for being honest and feeling that your needs were put on the back burner to his new wife's and stepdaughter's when he got remarried.  So therapy is not going to work to heal your relationship right now because he is not willing to accept the role his decisions and actions played in damaging the relationship between you.  I also have to say it was cowardly and inappropriate of him to confront you about what you said during therapy outside the session.", "NTA. Not sure what good therapy is doing if you get scolded. Also, it's not good if you have to go to and from the appointment with your father and in his car. That makes you a hostage to whatever blame he wants to put on you, or whatever \"attitude\" he wants to throw at you after the session. I wouldn't do it beyond one more time, unless your father really changes. Otherwise it's just a drain and a strain on you--and what's the point?", "NTA.\n\nI would end the therapy sessions if you tell the therapist and your Dad still chooses not to listen.\n\nIt might not be kind to say, but, in therapy is where you are supposed to be able to open up and say the things you normally conceal that aren't always kind, so you can come to a better understanding of each other, and how things got so bad. \n\nHalf of communication is talking, the other half is listening, even if it isn't always what you want to hear.", "NTA\n\nHe essentially robbed you of a normal childhood for his own relationship to a woman who he barely even knew.

Always.  \nHard NTA.\n\nYour father, on the other hand... HUGE AH.", "Tell your dad and the therapist the fact the truth hurts doesn't mean it's not the truth. Your father knowingly sacrificed you to help Gwen, and he needs to admit what he did is the reason you don't want to see him.", "He didn\u2019t want work on the relationship, he believed he had the moral high ground and wanted the therapist to pressure OP to say what he didn\u2019t wasn\u2019t bad.", "\ud83e\udd47\ud83d\udc4f This is a valuable piece of insight and also excellent advice.", "Gwen, as an adult, made an adult decision to have a relationship with a real wrong-un' to describe her ex mildly. She made the adult decision to have a child with him. That whole situation, as dangerous as it became, was not created without her active participation.\n\nThen she went looking for and found a mark in OP's dad as someone to rescue from her own prior adult life choices. Selfishly consumed all of OP's dad's resources without regard to the collateral damage that OP was suffering. Blew apart OP's previously safe and relatively content world, throwing him into years of instability, poverty, physical danger, and social isolation.

But he doesn't actually say he didn't have the assessment, he did say that his dad met with someone.  I don't disagree,  he probably should have gone to his grandparents earlier, but most parents don't want to give up their kids in the real world,  not Reddit world.", "What he said;\n\n> I was supposed to go for an assessment and my dad had a meeting with someone who told him it would be in my best interest to have stability as far as school was concerned\n\nDad did meet with someone.

Hopefully his grandparents helped get him an assessment."]}
