I moved in with my maternal grandparents almost 2 years ago now and our relationship, mine and dad's, only got worse after it.

My mom died when I was only a baby. Dad dated some when I was little but I don't remember many of them. There was one who was really nice and I liked her a lot. He was single for a while when I was about 8 and then when I was almost 10 he met the woman who would become his wife, Gwen. Gwen was a single mom who was in the middle of a bitter divorce and she had a daughter, Katie, who was almost 2. My dad moved them in really fast because he wanted to help Gwen with her ex. But that meant life for me changed in so many ways.\n\nHer ex was a dick. He was arrested several times. He would show up at the house and yell and curse and cause a scene. I was no longer allowed to have friends over or go to friends houses or hang out with my friends after school because dad wanted me \"home\" where he knew what was happening. He sold the house and downsized so they could go to court and try to get the ex's parental rights severed to Katie. Which meant as a 10 year old boy I was sharing a room with a 2 year old girl who was very new to me.\n\nWe moved around a lot to try and avoid the ex. I was 12 when learning disabilities were brought up for me and an amazing teacher realized years of struggling with had a reason. I was supposed to go for an assessment and my dad had a meeting with someone who told him it would be in my best interest to have stability as far as school was concerned, so I could have the best chance at learning and achieving my best. But we still moved a lot.\n\nI resented the hell out of all of this. To me Gwen and Katie were never worth all this turmoil. And when I was 15 I begged my grandparents to fight for me, which they did, and because my grandparents could use the educational neglect against my dad, it was decided I should stay with them for stability. My dad was upset. We already weren't close but afterward it was worse.\n\nWe had a couple of sessions solo with our therapist and we had two sessions together.

That his relationship with Gwen was not worth sacrificing the years of my life because of all the instability they brought. I pointed out how he never stopped to consider me in any of it. Just as long as Gwen and Katie were okay.\n\nHe was mad. After the session he told me how could I say that about my stepmom and baby sister. He told me it was a cruel thing to say.

He brought you into this world, it\u2019s his duty to put you first and it sounds like he did real damage to you in your formative years.", "Ugh, sounds like your dad really screwed things up for you. Not cool. NTA in my book.", "Nope you are not the AH. Your Dad is 100%the AH. He was wrong to bring Gwen and her daughter into your home so quickly. To then move you around like a bouncy ball so you had no stability bc of Gwen and her daughter. \nIt is a good sign that he warns to work on his relationship with you.

I hope he continues with the therapy, so at least someone will help him understand what he did.

You are close to 18.  You need to go NC as soon as you can.  Explain to your grandparents that this is for the best as they will object strongly.  You tell them you need to do this for the same reason they had to get custody from your father for school.  As long as your father is married to Gwen he is pretty clear here that you are not his priority if you ever were.", "> He told me it was a cruel thing to say.\n\nIt was true, and him not liking to hear it doesn\u2019t make it any less true. He wants you to pretend that he did nothing wrong but you are in no way an asshole for not coddling him.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like he can\u2019t handle the truth.", "He got to play the hero to his new wife at the expense of your mental wellbeing and educational development.

That is what it is there for.  So the therapist can see the dynamic and what is going on.  I'd make a condition of going back that you only talk about these things IN THE SESSION.

They sound amazing and I'm glad you have them.", "NTA\n\nSometimes the truth hurts.", "He knows he screwed but isn\u2019t willing to admit it. That\u2019s why he went straight to emotions. He can\u2019t argue with what you said, so he has to hit you with how what you said made him feel. So he gets to focus on your transgression while ignoring his. People in denial blame the messenger.", "Ooof. What a mess. Ok, so, to summarize, your father prioritized protecting a woman and her 2 year old child from her crazy ex with a long criminal record over ensuring your stability. So far so good? Ok. I think it's a nah situation. You can't expect me to say what your father did was wrong, I actually think what he did was brave. The only thing I don't like is that he made you stay home, preventing you from meeting your friends. He neglected your social needs under that aspect. But I also don't like how you say that Gwen and her daughter \"were not worth it\"... Honestly, you look like an ah for saying that. \n\nI don't think your father is a bad person, I have the opposite impression, and he also wants to fix his relationship with you. You are not the AH for expressing how you feel, but Jesus cut your father some slack, what he did was heroic. Sad that you had to pay a price in that, but that's life. I only have one question, before \"begging your grandparents to fight for you\" (your words), did you ask your father if you could go live with them? If so, how did he react?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Like I said, it is sad that OP found himself in that situation, but Gwen and her 2 years old daughter (it's a 2 years old, how heartless can you be?) were in a lot more danger than OP ever was.", "But that wasnt his fight to have, his fight at the time would have been to care for his son. You dont take in new people Into the family when doing that results in major neglect of your own kid. That is not bravery that is being a neglecful father"]}
