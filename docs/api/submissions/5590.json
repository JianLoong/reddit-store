You may not be close but you wanted to make sure you could spend your time with them.\n\nIf you're not going to be able to get there until 10 today, spend longer there instead. If your wife kicks up a fuss remind her it's Christmas and you want to spend a little longer with your family and you spent longer than planned with hers last night. \n\nAbout last night though, In future if you're not happy I'd probably remind her early on of the plan and if she's not happy just give her 30mins longer than planned (so would have given it until 9.30) and then start getting ready to leave.", "NTA. Welcome to being married. But she needs to understand this is a compromise on her part too. You're going to have to work out a better way to split the holidays. All Christmas Eve with hers, all Christmas Day with yours. Or do Christmas with one family the week before. Whatever you can all find that works for you. \n\nI say that as I sit at my parent's home with my brother and his family and my wife is back home working all weekend. \n\nBut you definitely need to do better at setting boundaries and working out things like this. Don't let this sort of thing fester into resentment.", "NTA\n\nYou are going to have to set some boundries with your wife about holidays.\n\nYou are married.  That does not mean you are attached at the hip and have to do everything together.\n\nWith your parents' ages, I think you should spend more time with them, even if your wife attends her family things solo.\n\nIt's possible that she should go to some of her family festivities alone.  An alternative is to take two cars so you can leave when you want to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood Luck", "NTA - sounds like you were pretty clear about what you expected, and it sounds like they didn't care. Now I'm not saying they were cruel or mean, maybe they just didn't realize it was important to you.\n\nSo my suggestion is you just have a calm talk with your wife and explain that you don't like having agreed upon arrangements just ignored because it suits her while it ignores your wises.", "NTA - it's perfectly reasonable to be upset about the whole situation.  Then again, these things happen and there's nothing you can do about the weather at this point.  I think the real question is what happens now?  Is she supportive of a plan to make sure you get to see your family tomorrow (even if that means she misses some of the next day's events with her family) or is she expecting that you give up any opportunity to see your family on Christmas?\n\nIf she's supportive of seeing your family later in the day at the expense of her family's events then just consider this poor planning, and work with her to try to do better next year.  If she expects you to completely abandon your family then I think you need a more involved discussion of what exactly each of your expectations are.\n\nI have some extended family who aren't respectful that everyone in a marriage comes with their own family.  Fortunately their married child gets it, and does the best they can to try to handle things fairly.  That makes a big difference, even if it can still be frustrating.", "NTA for being pissed. That's totally justified.\n\nYou could end up one depending on how you handle your anger though.", "NTA.  But you must insist on having a relaxed and long visit with your parents in the afternoon, since you will miss the planned breakfast.", "NTA. You only have a few hours on Christmas morning with your own family and the rest is with hers, and you feel like this wasn't taken seriously and now might not happen. I get it. \n\nBut if I were you at this point I'd suck it up, try my best to enjoy Christmas and have a discussion with her next week. Theres nothing you can do now that'll change things and you'll only feel like TA for putting a damper on Christmas day if it starts a fight. They've been inconsiderate but not malicious. \n\nI'm sorry though, this really does suck for you.", "NTA.  I understand your upset and frustration at the situation.  I don't think anyone did this on purpose, so hopefully you can just be annoyed instead of truly pissed off.   Either you can make late brunch for your parents tomorrow, or skip the cooking and just spend a few relaxing hours with them.  If that makes you late to wife's grandma's house, tough.  I hope you have a very merry Christmas.", "I'm not sure what boundary she crossed? Did the weather make traveling unsafe?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just putting it somewhere and talking to her about it helped so much. I do just want to say that my wife is amazing and I love her family. It will still be a good day tomorrow and I know how lucky I am. Thank you again for listening; it helped more than you know.", "The boundary that was broken was the agreement to leave no later than 9pm. They agreed. They didn't go specifically for dinner but to spend time with family. When dinner didn't get started until 8:30 then they should've simply missed that part. Because they didn't stick to their agreement his parents will now be missing out on their time with their son and also have to cook breakfast. They are elderly and I find that to be a bit unacceptable....especially considering they will have a round 2 with her family again tomorrow. Where does his family and his desires fit in. I get that she can't control the weather but if they had left at the agreed upon time they would've made all of their commitments. NTA", "Yes; and I am so sorry the boundaries are more of a previously discussed thing with her family overall.", "I try to be a \"solve the problem, don't assign blame\" kind of guy, and this feels like a situation that very much calls for that attitude.  If the problem is \"I'm not going to get to spend time with my family\" then that's totally fixable if everyone agrees it's a problem worth fixing.\n\nThe first few Christmases after getting married can be hard.  You're still trying to work out what the newly formed family's traditions are going to be, and you've got two families vying for your time (or in my case 3, because my parents are divorced.)  It takes a few years to figure out how you're going to handle it, and you have to accept that there are going to be some disappointments before it's all worked out.  Things that seem like they should work may not (say because some family gatherings never end on time,) and you've got to figure out a plan that really works.  If everyone is caring and respectful (well, at least the spouses are) then it's totally possible to find something that works, it just takes a few tries.", "I'm not sure you can blame her or her family for the weather worsening.", "Good luck. My wife\u2019s and her family sound similar.  They tend to lack self awareness.  After a few years of giving in to them I started to be very clear with my wife that they will most likely not die tomorrow and we can be fair with time.  But I won\u2019t be taken advantage because my family is laid back.  When they are try to take lay off he passive aggressive thing and make me look bad I just agree with them politely.  They still make comments here and there but I see it for what it is and they know I won\u2019t give in so they don\u2019t push it.  It\u2019s annoying no matter what I do. I get an agreement with my wife before hand about what the plan is a hold her to it.  She like her family will always try to take advantage of it.  It\u2019s a constant frustration.  But i would much rather deal with there complaining then be taken advantage of by there self centered mindset.", "Are you his wife?", "You\u2019re NTA and I think you need to have a proper talk about priorities with your wife. Being late is one thing but having to skip a meal *you re supposed to prepare for your elderly parents* because she couldn\u2019t be bothered to leave on time is a whole other ballpark. If this ever happens again, just leave without her. The time your parents have left is limited.", "Your wife prioritised her family over yours. Set boundaries you were suppose to leave at half 8 why did she think it was ok to stay an extra 3 hrs and 15 mins when she KNEW the weather was going to be bad!? NTA", "NTA, at all. You need to talk with your wife. I was that wife when I was first married I wanted to spend the night at my parents house for Christmas because that was just what we did, I mean as a child we went to my grandparents house for Christmas. Well, after the first Christmas my husband talked to me and told me as much as I love my family it was time that we as a family make our our traditions. You are a bit different you have 2 sides of family there and you need you need you to spend time with both families and make time for you two", "NTA. I\u2019ve been in that situation myself where I had to leave in bad weather because \u201cwell, you can\u2019t leave until we\u2019ve done X tradition\u2026\u201d and it just goes on and on. \n\nHer family isn\u2019t obligated to change their schedule to accommodate yours, but your wife should have stuck to your agreement and recognized that the time with your family is equally as important. I agree with the commenter who said you should extend the time with your parents tomorrow; not in a passive-aggressive way, but whatever time you need to ensure they get the breakfast and time they were promised. Give her parents a new time to expect you at Grandma\u2019s and thank them for the hospitality of a safe place to stay (so that you don\u2019t just say the thing that upsets them).", "NTA\n\nSet boundaries immediately or this will be how the next few years go. You being dismissed for what your wife wants.", "Agree that you can/should spend longer today with your parents since their time is cut short because of spending so much longer with hers. \nAs for giving her the extra half hour going forward, good idea but be ready for it not to go smoothly. If her family isn't on board with things starting on time (so you can leave on time), my guess is she will push back about leaving. SHE needs to set those boundaries with her family as they (boundaries/timeline) need to be important to her because the two of you have commitments to others. Her family needs to jump on board with your plan.\nSome in my family have 3 places to hit Christmas day. Starts at my house. I'm always very conscientious about keeping the pace because I know their day is more stressful than mine.", "NTA \n\nI suggest spending extra time with your parents and skipping meeting at her grandmother\u2019s house later.  If you\u2019re in the US, weather is atrocious for much of the country.  People are currently being advised to cut down on traveling for a reason.", "That's good to hear- Have a great Christmas!", "Especially in the absence of kids. \n\nOnce you have kids, \u201cwe\u2019re going to do our own thing\u201d is totally acceptable. Cause of the kids. Everyone understands that. \n\nBut as a couple? Nah, you\u2019re the young people that can just bend over backwards and sideways to accommodate other people\u2019s needs. Party runs late? You\u2019re fine! You\u2019re just you guys, there\u2019s no other factors going on! (Spoiler alert, there are many other factors going on, including not wanting to be there!)."]}
