Apologize and let this go. YTA.", "YTA\n\nWhat didn't \"traumatize\" you as a kid is irrelevant. Your niece is not you, you don't know how she'd react. Your niece is 6, get her age appropriate gifts that are made for 6 years old.", "I love the original stories! My aunt read them to me when I was her age. In my opinion, NTA. My favourite thing to do is read the original story and then watch the Disney movie and see what they changed. For example, Rapunzel vs Disney's Tangled. They are nothing alike! I'm currently reading journey to wonderland (not Brothers Grimm).\n\nI will agree there are some disturbing aspects to some, but not all, stories, but they're vague and lack detail. Chances are she didn't even understand them. \n\nThey are right that it's their decision on if it's appropriate for her. I don't think you are T A for gifting it though. Mom and dad won't know if they are okay until they read them too. Now they have, and now they made a decision.", "NAH. They are in their right to expose their child or not to those stories, you had no ill will in your gift. It's just an \"oh well\" situation, don't push it. \nI also had old fairy tale books growing up and I loooved them. I only read those with \"dark\" parts once I was a bit older though, maybe 8-9~? So I understand the parents as well.", "YTA those stories are quite gory. Also people don\u2019t remember what age they were as well as they think. Even in the 30\u2019s they knew that Snow White was too messed up for kids, that\u2019s why they changed it for the movie. At 6 you\u2019re brain isn\u2019t developed enough to handle stories like that. Just apologize and move on. Next time look for an age appropriate gift", "So when I was a kid, I watched the \"Terminator\" , \"Alien\" and \"Predator\". I also saw the original TV series of \"IT\" before I was ten.\n\nMy son is ten and wouldn't dream of showing him those movies. They are not his thing, in this respect he is a completely different kid to me and so I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nJust because they were fine for you, doesn't mean they are fine for other children. You should have checked with your sibling first, not assume she's like you.\n\nYta", "NAH\n\nNot every child is the same and parents get to make the call as they see fit.

All kids are different. Some are far more sensitive than others. My 2 are sensitive and prone to nightmares. Imagine my surprise when I started reading Grimms Cinderella, only to find out the stepmother tells her own daughters to cut off part of their foot to \"make\" the glass slippers fit.

So them being short with you was uncalled for.", "I don't think they're particularly controversial. That's what it was like around that time, and we can use this as a teaching moment for children, to explain the context and what it meant then, and how children were educated at the time, and how we would rather do this today.\n\nIt's ok for your brother to be concerned and think about this stuff though.

But because you\u2019re upset that your brother & sil don\u2019t think it\u2019s an appropriate gift for their child.. they are the parents they are trying to protect/control the media that their kids consume. And that\u2019s their right.", "NTA.  Maybe the book is appropriate for your niece, maybe it isn't.  They can choose not to read them.  But I definitely disagree with the majority of people who seem to think you should never argue with a child's parents over what is ok for a child.  Parents get the final say but I've seen many, many times what happens when no one argues with a parent.  Most parents will over protect their children and not realize that doing so harms them.  It's the job of extremely close family members to to try and keep families existing in reality.", "YTA. 6 years old is too young for the actual original Grimms'- some of those are really dark, scary, and generally messed up horror stories. \n\nIn general, different children have different tolerance for horror stories, and parents have to gauge that. Did you have any reason to think your niece would like something that dark? Or did you just say \"I read these as a kid, she'll be fine\"?\n\nThere are excellent reasons the modern children's versions of those tales have been edited, and some tales left out completely - in fact, most of those changes were made over 100 years ago, so it's just not modern helicopter parents being sensitive! An older child might be okay with them, but I think very few 6 year olds would be. It may not have traumatized you per se, but you don't seem to have turned out with good judgment either.", "Grimm's Cinderella version definitely has the stepsisters cutting off chunks of their feet to fit the slipper, and I can't recall whether it has the ending with birds pecking out their eyes as punishment, or the one where they are rolled down hills in barrels lined with the spikes of nails...\n\nYou have cosy nostaglic memories of these fairytales. Not all 6yos are you, and these stories are seriously violent, sometimes sexualised, and always grotesque - often to horror genre levels!\n\nNot a great choice for a young modern kid generally (who you don't seem to know well), but you're allowed to give crappy gifts! YTA though for being offended it was found to be disturbing and inappropriate, which you were only told because you wouldn't leave it alone. You don't get to dictate how people receive or perceive gifts from you - you can be disappointed it wasn't appreciated and try to choose something they like better next time, but it's AH territory for taking personal offence over something so insignificant.", "NAH.  It's a reasonable difference of opinion.  Cogent arguments can be made on both sides here.\n\nIf you don't drop it though you'll become TA.  You've said your peace, the parents of the child disagree.  They're the final authority, and their argument isn't unreasonable.\n\nGet over it.  This is their decision and they made it.", "NAH. I don't think either of you are wrong. If you don't see anything wrong with the book, then that's fair and I actually agree that book is fine for a kid. However, it is ultimately up to the parents.\n\nI think your brother could have just said they might wait until she is a little older to let her read it, and it doesn't make you an AH. You were just trying to do something nice for your niece.", "People made child-friendly versions of Brothers Grimms\u2019 tales because they are incredibly vulgar and grotesque. Given that whole point of those tales is to SCARE children into acting right, I can\u2019t *imagine* why your brothers family wouldn\u2019t find it appropriate, YTA. Did you even read those stories before gifting the book?", "YTA and you made a mistake giving the Grimm fairytales to a 6 old.\n\nYou should\u2019ve given it a read first. It ain\u2019t all Little Red Riding Hood and Three Little Pigs. Stories like that floated to the top because they\u2019re the least shitty ones.\n\nThere is, I shit you not, a story in that book called The Jew In The Thorns.\n\nIt\u2019s about a tricky thieving Jew who pretends to be a beggar and begs a man out of his last gold coin. But the man pulls out a magical fiddle that makes you dance when he plays it, and then he dances the jew into a thorn patch to punish him.\n\nMoral of the story is that Jews are greedy tricksters and they get what they deserve.", "YTA don't get me wrong I love the grimm fairytales and some kids are mature at I young age (I was) but alot of kids aren't I wouldn't give my nephew that book", "NTA\n\nI got the same fairy tales at the same age. My parents didn't bat an eye.", "Yta not for getting her the book. You thought she'd like it,  but it wasn't a hit. That happens. Where you tip into ahole territory is by INSISTING they're wrong.

Even if she doesn't read it now, it can be a treasured copy when she gets older. \n\nHaving said all of the above. her parents can censor her media use due to them being her parents.

It is up to the parent to decide was is appropriate for their own kids.\n\nA little girl I know saw a My Little Pony movie where the pretty little butterfly bit a frolicking pony on the nose.

I still have this book and I keep all of the 4-leaf clovers I find in it\u2019s pages.\n\nGrowing up my mother read these tales to me and then I read them on my own.  It really helped with my deep interest in reading and love of the library from a young age.  It helped me forge a curiosity about books and stories.

The Grimm brothers were part of a religious sect (read cult) that hated women.  Like hardcore hated women, believed them to be the reason that the world was bad and that sin existed.  So they rewrote a lot of the stories to downplay the fathers involvement while making all the evil characters be women.", "YTA.

You should stop argueing with them and just drop it, it's not your say what they read to their child. Argueing is where you are TA.", "Those \"controversial\" fairy tales involve people pushed down hills in barrels filled with glass, cannibalism, child abandonment, and are written as darkly as possible. I'd call some of them the children's equivalent to a reading only about the torture traps in saw before bed. Those stories were given those themes to intentionally be scary as ways to prevent children from doing dangerous things and to teach lessons (going into the woods by themselves, trusting \"witches\", being outright cruel, etc) because the world has different kinds of dangers back then. Those types of dangers are not nearly as relevant anymore, better stories have been made that teach the same lessons, and better ways to teach kids about those same lessons have been found. \n\nOne of the reasons for that is because SCARING CHILDREN DOESN'T WORK the way it sound like it should. Not all kids took those stories and learned from it, it just served to traumatize and instill fear responses to everything instead of giving kids a way to actually learn the lessons and deal with the issue.\n\nThat girl only knows each of the stories in that book in their most wholesome forms, of course those stories are going to freak her out.\n\nYTA, just cause some messed German children's stories didn't freak you out as a kid, doesn't mean it won't freak out another.
