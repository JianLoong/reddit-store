We eloped and then had a small reception. My parents and his father were understanding, as they all also eloped. His mother, however, was upset that she would not be present at the ceremony. She has expressed disapproval at every decision we have made. She was very against our relationship, even going so far as to try and set my husband up with other girls while we were dating. Suffice it to say she is not my biggest fan despite my continued attempts at courtesy. \n\nSo, the night before our elopement/reception, we were at dinner with a few friends and both sets of parents. My husband pulled his parents aside and told them I would not change my last name as I am adopted, and my current name is precious to me. She was immediately hostile. After that, she did not speak to me once. Not at the reception to celebrate that I had just married her son. Not a word. She was blatantly rude to my mother, sister, and 13-year-old niece. I am livid and beyond hurt. It's been a challenging year as I have been struggling with PTSD. I am unable to find it in myself even to consider forgiving her. Not that she has attempted to apologize. \n\nSeveral family members have advised me to give it time and offered the counterpoint of \"You could've talked to her.\" I said it was my wedding reception and everybody else managed to find me. She has been so hostile for six years now, and I honestly was willing to let bygones be bygones if the reception went well. But she disrespected me, my family, and our marriage. She was so moody the whole night, broadcasting her disapproval that we were together. I don't have it in me to deal with this anymore. I told my husband I was not going to their home for any holiday or function where I would have to see her. AITA?\n\nEDIT: clarification here. My husband is on my side and is just as upset with his mother. He has already brought it up a little with his dad and is unwilling to spend time with them without me. He sees her behavior as disrespectful to both of us and is not taking it lightly at all.", "created_utc": 1695602291, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rds0z/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_holidays_with_my/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She sounds like a real piece of work. You don't owe her shit, especially after all the crap she's pulled over the years. Don't let anyone guilt you into spending time with someone who clearly doesn't respect you or your marriage.", "NTA\n\nyour husband should tell her very simple that you\u2019re his wife and she needs to treat you with respect. That\u2019s it. And until she does, he doesn\u2019t want to spend holidays with her. (I\u2019m saying that part because you mention above that he\u2019s upset and doesn\u2019t want to go without you)", "NTA.  \nAs your desire for your adopted name goes, family is more than blood and documents. Its a choice, and love. I would say, if you don't go full NC, go once in a while to maintain that you're the bigger person, and more for your new husband than anyone else. But definitely don't back down any time mil mentions the last name, or anything else. You're an adult, and the spouse of her child. She owes you basic respect, and it shows poorly on her if she doesn't, not you.", "NTA.  \n\nWhy isn't husband dealing with this problem?  It is his job to confront his mom and set out the rules.  He needs to tell her that he is married now and she needs to be polite and friendly to his wife.  He should tell her that if she can't do that, then you will BOTH not be attending any events.  If she agrees then you should both go to whatever family event they host but if she doesn't greet you and smile and be nice he should grab his coat and lead you out.", "Not going to pass judgment.\n\nYour husband needs to fix this and set boundaries with his mother.  Should have done it already.", "NTA at all.  It sounds like his mother isn't trying to make this work and you would have an absolutely miserable time.  Your husband needs to put his foot down and tell his mother to cut the shit or you and him won't be around much. Good luck", "NTA, if you've been trying to placate this woman for as long as you say you have. After a certain point, you're just done. I get it. She pushed the right button on the wrong day.", "NTA that is horrifyingly repulsive?? is your husband actually gonna go spend bonding time with them with zero apology from them? this os a perfect opportunity to go NC with those people and plan some good mental health recovery days", "NTA.  Don't subject yourself, or your future children, to this hostility.", "NTA. Don't destroy your holidays by spending them with your enemy. Have your husband let them know \"*We* won't be spending this holiday with you.\" Repeat for each occasion until his mother loses her hostility (i.e.: essentially as long as she's still alive).", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't treat you with respect, so you don't owe her any extra courtesy.\n\nYou and your husband should make your plans for holidays together based on what the two of you want to do, not based on guilt and manipulation from people outside your relationship.", "NTA. Why would your husband even bother to share that you are not taking his name? Weird.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband should be the one dealing with all this. It's his mother. It's long past time he set boundaries with her.", "NTA. As long as you\u2019re husband is fine with it, I see no problems with it. Not that it would make you the AH if he did have problems with it, just saying that as long as he doesn\u2019t care there\u2019s no need for compromise or anything like that, it should be easy enough to just not go. My brother & his wife are on good terms with our family but spend most holidays with his inlaws anyway. So even if you\u2019re on good terms that doesn\u2019t mean you have to see them on holidays and such.", "NTA. I don't blame you for not wanting to be where you're treated badly.", "NTA, doubt she will ever come around.  A HS friend of mine married her HS boyfriend after college.  His mother never felt she was good enough for him and treated her like dirt.  My friend and her husband both joke that the best time they had with his mother was at his mother's funeral.", "Nta mil is the asshole. I'm all for disapproval but it's gotta be logical. A legit reason. None of this you didn't have a wedding etc bullshit. Honestly I would talk to your husband about cutting her out until she can be an adult.", "ESH. Why do you think she\u2019s even going to want you to come??? If she\u2019s that hostile you\u2019re playing into her hand.  I\u2019d go just to annoy her - she clearly doesn\u2019t like you - let her look bad to her son and not you to your husband.", "ESH\n\nYeah, your MIL hasn't exactly made you feel welcome, but your spite is also going to make life very difficult for your husband.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is TA. He sabotaged your reception. WTF was that about?", "NTA. She's a narcissist.", "Oh, boy. Welcome to life with a cluster B mother in law. She will never apologize, she will stomp all over your boundaries, and she will never change. It\u2019s not a great prognosis. You might want to read up on the subject. Sorry.", "NTA. But I honestly think you would feel better if you addressed the issue with her. \u201cMIL, you have been hostile, rude and disrespectful to me and my family. You have been clearly disapproving of decisions your son and I have made together. I just want you to know that I don\u2019t need your approval, and I don\u2019t need you to love me. But I would appreciate being treated with basic polite manners. And I will do the same for you. If you\u2019re not able to do that, I won\u2019t choose to spend time with someone who is so unpleasant to me.\u201d\n\nYour husband should be standing at your side for this. Once you\u2019ve addressed the hostility and disapproval and made it clear you\u2019re willing to be politely interactive with her, she has to do the same or be responsible for any alienation from her son. I would not state it as an ultimatum, and I would not say it in anger. Practice it until you are so ready that she can\u2019t derail you. I think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s so much better than avoiding her, because that\u2019s really exhausting.", "ESH -- you are being no less petty and spiteful than she is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
