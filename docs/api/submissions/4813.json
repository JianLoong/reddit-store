{"id": 4813, "submission_id": "zmmhc8", "title": "AITA for being rude to my grandmother for suggesting surrogacy?", "selftext": "Some background information:\n\nI (17M), am a trans man and have recently started testosterone. I have been out of the closet to everyone for nearly 2,5 years. To my family I have said I am trans since I was 11, but they didn\u2019t believe me until I was 15 years old. My grandmother has been using the wrong pronouns this entire time and sometimes deadnames me in front of my family and tells them to not tell me, instead of apologising. My sister (22F) and her boyfriend (23M) want to have children sometime in the future, but because my sister suffers from kidney failure (my dad\u2019s going to donate!) and has Crohn\u2019s disease, they\u2019re not sure if she can safely become pregnant.\n\nI have always been adamant about not wanting to get pregnant, because the idea makes me extremely uncomfortable. \n\nI\u2019m quite busy so after a long day I went to my grandparents\u2019 house. My grandmother (78) is quite talkative and doesn\u2019t really think before she speaks. She was mostly asking after my sister, who she had spoken to the day before, instead of me, which kind of hurt since I hadn\u2019t seen my grandparents in a while, but I also understand her worry. Eventually we somehow got onto the topic of my sister\u2019s future difficulties with having children. She then suggested I be a surrogate for her.\n\nTo make it clear, in Dutch, the word for a surrogate is \u2018draagmoeder\u2019 or to translate it directly, carrying mother. This *hurt*. I quickly cut her idea off and told her that I am not a woman and thus would never be a \u2018draagmoeder\u2019. I also told her that it made me extremely uncomfortable.\n\nThe rest of the evening went by awkwardly. She kept saying she was an old woman and that she just finds it hard to remember, but at the same time she boasts to my family about how she can walk 15km in a day without breaking a sweat and can speak three languages. She always mentions how young she feels, except when it comes to deadnaming me or using the wrong pronouns.\n\nAfter I got home, I told my parents and they were shocked, but they also told me I can\u2019t really blame my grandmother because she\u2019s a \u2018flapuit\u2019 (someone who speaks whatever comes to mind). My mother said something like \u2018live and let live\u2019.\n\nTo be completely honest, I\u2019m still not happy. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should be angry with my grandmother, since the rest of my family kind of brushes it off. They\u2019re not happy with what was said, but they\u2019re also not doing anything about it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671114727, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmmhc8/aita_for_being_rude_to_my_grandmother_for/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So, she has left you with no other choice other than to get angry with her. \n\nSomeone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t think before they talk\u201d is a shit excuse for being rude. This simply means they are too lazy to put the effort to be polite or considerate. Perhaps if someone gives you grief about getting angry with your grandmother, you should say you are the kind of person who doesn\u2019t think before you speak. \n\nYour grandmother has spent her entire life saying thoughtless, insensitive things to everyone around her, but every one is shocked when the same thing happens to her. A classic case of somebody who can dish it out but can\u2019t take it.", "NTA\n\nI have a trans sister and our mom always deadnames her. I won't hijack your post but it really grinds my gears. \n\nSorry she's being this way, and using lame reasons to try to excuse her behavior.", "I'll say it's the age and/or cultural difference u two have. Not that these are excuses but if she is someone who says what they think and is in there 70s then they are prepared for those consequences. If you need clarification you are NTA but don't rule out the memory thing, forgetting something you learned 2 years ago isn't uncommon at that age but if you find that it is her just being disrespectful then your have to make your own choice for your relationship with her moving forward, as you shouldn't have feel that way from her.", "The fact your grandmother would suggest a teenagers becomes a surrogate is horrifying in itself.

Btw your sister is young and has many options getting kids.", "NTA your grandmother is transphobic and unless she's struggling with medical memory issues(eg dementia), she can only hide behind her excuses for so long before everyone realises that she's not even making an effort to accept you at all. People can be direct and say things off their head WHILE being sensitive and empathic, anyone else who uses being direct as an excuse is just in denial of their rudeness. You can give her benefit of the doubt when it's an isolated incident but not when it's becoming a pattern. She can apologise every time she's being transphobic and hurtful but she'll probably never change and you're also allowed to not tolerate any of that even if ShE's FaMiLy", "NTA. I would just move on. I get being angry at your grandmother, but that seems like a lot of energy to spend on someone who won\u2019t change. It\u2019s not worth giving her space in your brain.", "No physician in their right mind would ever consider allowing 1) a teenager 2) who had never given birth to be a surrogate, even if they were 100% on board. \n\nIf your grandmother doesn\u2019t stop all of this I\u2019d tell her she can listen to me ignore her in all 3 of the languages she speaks.

I hope your family realise she shouldn't be allowed to get away with it. Age isn't an excuse.", "NTA Op. That's very disrespectful no matter your grandmother's age.

They just are.\nYour grandmother seems to have always gotten away with stuff like this because \"she doesn't think before she speaks\" -what a lame excuse- and your family seems to avoid any conflict with an even lamer excuse through the \"live and let live\". Why can't your grandmother \"let You live\" -even more happy I would assume- as her grandson, whom she loves and respects, just like she did her granddaughter.\nAnd I hope you can show/explain to her AND the rest of your family (except for your sister as far as I can tell) that this is really hurting you and -if you choose to- to go NC if they cannot accept and respect that, for your own mental health.", "NTA.

Sure I get it why it could be \u2018confusing\u2019 at first for her, it\u2019s kind of like smart phones. She didn\u2019t know them her whole life so it\u2019s difficult. Honest mistakes are a thing but she does this on purpose because she doesn\u2019t agree with your choice and doesn\u2019t accept that it\u2019s actually a thing.

When grandma speaks her mind absolutely call her out on it. Your parents try to correct you just say you take after grandma and are a flapuit too. Can't help it and if they are not going to correct her then they should not correct you either", "NTA. As others have pointed out, you are 17 and no one should be suggesting you be a surrogate, even if you weren\u2019t trans. Also, I don\u2019t know how it works everywhere, but I think you typically have to have carried a pregnancy to be a surrogate. Also, she has had years to learn that you\u2019re a guy. She surely can remember by now!\n\nCongratulations on starting testosterone! That\u2019s really exciting! And good luck to your sister with her health and finding a way to have a baby.

It's not okay to generalize like that.\n\nEdit: I also think that it's very different thing to have your own children as a trans man than be a surrogate.

I'm not trans myself but I have many amazing LGBTQ+ people in my support system, I also have many homophobic transphobic family members that I'm almost no contact with these days. It's a tricky one cause they could be so incredibly lovely and we can try to be empathetic that growing up in the older generation probably made it harder for them to understand the LGBTQ+ community, but we only have so much empathy before we need to save some for ourselves and our wellbeing. Some people like to keep contact with their conflicting families because they think the good part of them outweighs the bad part, and some people like me don't as these disagreements are deal breakers for me. Sometimes I still grief for the \"happy\" family dynamics/memories I no longer have but my mental health is so much better since I've made the choice to distance myself from them, therapy helps so much as well, so if you have the resources or authority to seek therapy it'll probably be really good for you too.\n\nSorry to hear that it took so long for your family to take your identity seriously and considering how some family is still not accepting, you have a long journey of tough life choices ahead of you OP.
