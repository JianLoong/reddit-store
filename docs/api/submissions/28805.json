It's exhausting and I know how shit it is for people that don't act like this.", "Not really, in the past I\u2019ve tried to please her and that hasn\u2019t worked haha so I\u2019ve just started to ignore her and will continue with that.

She would never criticize her beloved brother...ever. It used to annoy my bf as well.
