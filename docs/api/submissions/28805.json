Your husband should help more on the days leading up to her arrival to help clean. Even if it means hiring someone to deep clean the house before she arrives. \n\nHowever, I don't think this ultimatum was a kind way to deal with this issue especially when it sounds like you three have a good relationship otherwise. There are other ways to manage. \n\nYou need to be honest and kind with your mother in law and simply tell her, \"Hey MIL - I really do appreciate your help when you're here, but I work a long schedule and I don't think I can keep up with your standards of clean. I try my best, but I would really appreciate it if we could find another way to communicate your dissatisfaction because the current way we communicate gives me a lot of anxiety.\" \n\nI had a conversation like this with my own mother and she decided herself that she was going to limit her days visiting because she \"can't stand seeing dirty dishes\" because it gives her anxiety and I told her kindly that we try our best but dishes happen, I have ADHD, and my partner and I do our best to manage the cleaning the best we can. \n\nI'm sure like my mother - your mother got a lot of flack about the cleanliness of space and is trying her best to communicate her own anxiety about these things and is unfortunately passing that trauma to you. Don't take it too personally. In Buddhism it is said happiness is a path - not a destination. It's a choice we make. Try not to let her bother you and do your best to forgive her as she might not be aware how unhappy and uncomfortable it's making you. The only way to do that is to show by example and communicate in a kind, honest and respectful way.", "NTA at all.

That being said I have a 3 step procedure for that kind of personality that might help you.\n\n1. Reply to every critical remark with a variation of \"I'm sorry. I didn't hear you, can you repeat that?\" \n2. Listen attentively and then politely ask them to explain the statement.\n3. Address every concern in excruciating detail with a closing statement of \"This is how I choose to run my house\".  \n\nWhen you react this way you maximize the amount of effort they have to put into the misbehavior while minimizing their avenues of attack. It either slowly sucks the life out of them so they gradually stop... or they explode for seemingly no reason. In either case, that would decrease the amount of time she wants to spend around you.", "Practice this line:\n\n\"Shut the fuck up, BRENDA!\"\n\nNTA", "NTA hotels are for guests in my book!

Personally, I hate family staying with us period, so I'm thankful for our small house :) Going down from 2 weeks to 2 days might feel like a harsh jump, so I can see where your husband is coming from, even though you deserve to be comfortable in your own house.\n\nMy MIL isn't exactly like this, but she's got some similar traits of getting worked up over stupid things that put everyone on edge. I just start gently poking fun at her and it usually diffuses the situation or she at least lets it go so I stop ribbing her. I've been with my husband for 15 years (married almost 10) and it definitely took some time to figure out the best way to maintain my sanity with her, so hopefully you can, too, if she's otherwise not that bad and this isn't specifically just something she's doing to be mean to you.\n\nCan you also plan to be out of the house a bit more while she's visiting to give her and your husband some one on one time? Maybe some extra workout classes or dinner with friends to give them space? That's part of my strategy - just let husband deal with his mom and I am around as much as I need to be, but no more than that.", "I'd hand her the rag or the laundry basket and tell her have at it.", "Nta.

I think your husband needs to directly say, \"Mom, I love you, and I love having you here, but do you realize how hard you are on OP?\" And go from there. \n\nIf he wants to have his mom stay for longer, he needs to manage the relationship so that what he wants doesn't wreck your sanity.\n\nBut if he refuses to get involved, this is the line I use on my mom that is fairly effective.\n\n\"Thank you, [name], but I've hit my quota on criticism for the day. I will not be accepting further feedback  for the next 24 hours. Thank you for your cooperation.\"\n\nThe key is to sound tired and joking, not aggressive or angry. You're not challenging whatever judgment or criticism MIL got. You're just drawing attention to the quantity of comments. If you get back some concern-trolling response like \"I just care about you (and your laundry chair)\" you can respond something like \"I know, but I just want to enjoy your company right now, can we talk about something more pleasant?\"\n\nIf the criticism continues, you leave to run an errand, grab some Starbucks, etc, but you leave.\n\nThere's a risk of doing this with a MIL vs. your own mom, which is why ultimately it should come from your husband.
