In these two weeks i still did manager duties like making the schedule, checked on inventory, placed orders for coke products, and etc. Well payday rolls around and i pick up my check and my pay was cut DRASTICALLY. to put into perspective my checks would be about $1200 biweekly, and with this check i was paid $650\u2026 i worked the same hours, did all my manager duties, even trained the new staff that would take my place since i didn\u2019t want to burden the owner.

You're employer will always act like you are \" family.\"\nAs long as you are killing yourself to work hard for them..

I hope those AHs suffered from your absence", "NTA.\n\nHe docked your pay without notice. If you knew you wouldn't be paid as the manager, I'm sure you wouldn't have worked as one. He needs to pay up or face the consequences.", "NTA and definitely illegal for them to cut your wage for leaving. Also they didn\u2019t demote you so you would expect to get the same pay", "Nta. You need to look into your state employment laws as well as federal. Some states allow the employer to drop pay rate if notice is given. There are also states that say you must be informed of pay decrease before a full hour of work. So look into your state labor laws. You can also blast him on social media for being a bad employer ,make sure you have pictures of paystubs as proof in case they try to get you for slander, as well as the workers you worked with and trained. Not to sure they will want to work for someone that\u2019s known for screwing over employees.", "NTA. You said you\u2019re in the US. Some labor laws vary by state, but employers don\u2019t get to unilaterally decide what to pay their employees. Even if you no-show your next 7 shifts, they owe you your wages for the time you did work at the agreed rate. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to report him, write him a demand letter stating the facts (that you worked X hours at Y rate but were paid X hours at Z rate instead) and what you need him to do for you not to report him (pay the  difference of X times [Y-Z] rate by next payday, and make sure the hours/rate worked since that last paycheck are correct as well). Then it\u2019s up to him - he can either grow up and act professionally, or be petty and deal with a wage and hour claim.", "NTA Putting in your 2 week notice doesn\u2019t mean you lose your position at work. I\u2019ve never in my 20 year of work experience heard of a business demoting someone because they put in 2 weeks notice. Sounds a lot like retaliation which is also illegal. Please check your states labor laws. I had an issue with an employer withholding pay and giving me the run around. Unfortunately for them what they did caused them to not only pay me my wages but they also had to pay me my regularly hour rate for 8 hours a day for all the days they withheld pay. I got an extra 9 days of pay. Check your states labors and even call your states labor department and they can walk you through everything", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDocument everything, and report your boss for wage theft.", "NTA. These smaller businesses think they are immune to labor laws. If this was on America I'm sure you have a case on your hands. \n\nI know it sounds petty, but unpaid wages for works performed is highly illegal", "NTA. Owner tried to punish you by stealing your wages, so you left a job the owner said wasn't yours anymore. Seems fair to me.", "NTA\n\nIt's a crime for him to not pay the wages he owed you.
