I work as a nurse. 3 days a week, I work 12 hour shifts (12 pm-12 am). After my husband passed, I needed a nanny to tend to my kids from the time they got off school (3 pm) onwards. I decided a live-in was the best choice. I have one guest bedroom. \n\nI live right near a university. Around this time, my niece had just gotten accepted. She wanted to save cost on dorms and offered to watch my kids those 3 days, if she could live there rent free. I agreed, and said I\u2019d also pay her $22/hr (a competitive rate for our area). She\u2019s done with her classes by 1, so it works out. She fixes them dinner and puts them to bed. Then she\u2019s free to do whatever. But of course I pay her from 3 pm-12:30 am. It worked for 2 years. My niece never had any complaints.\n\nNow, however, my niece is getting an (paid) internship related to her major that starts in January. She wouldn\u2019t be available to watch my kids. I congratulated her and said I could help her look into student housing or an apartment. We\u2019d have 3 months to do this. She was confused. I said since I would need a live in and only have one guest room, she would have to move out. My niece got upset and said this isn\u2019t fair, she won\u2019t be able to save any money if she gets a dorm or an apartment (she could afford to live on her own, but wouldn\u2019t have much savings). I pointed out that this would work best for me as I had to put my kids in aftercare the other 2 days I work (I get off around 5) and the nanny could just pick them up from  school vs them having to stay there so long.\n\nMy niece argued that the nanny could leave at the end of her shift but after speaking to some nannies, they understandably don\u2019t want to drive home so late. Plus, I\u2019m fine with the nanny (and my niece) sleeping after the kids do. So, there\u2019s no sense in them sleeping then waking up and driving so drowsy. Even I feel nervous driving home so late, especially after my long shift. \n\nMy SIL (her mom) feels this is unfair to my niece but she moved in under the condition that she\u2019d work as a nanny. My SIL and brother live 3 hours away, so niece couldn\u2019t commute if she moved back in with them. They feel I should try to find a nanny who\u2019d be willing to drive home at 12:30 AM (it\u2019d take me a half hour minimum to get home), but all nannies I\u2019ve spoken to have said no or expressed concern about their safety driving so late. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696955354, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174pgvq/aita_for_telling_my_niece_shell_have_to_move_out/", "score": 767, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd go for the jugular and ask them why they feel a widowed single mother who's just trying to hold it all together is obligated to provide their adult daughter with free housing.  I'm surprised you were paying her as much as you were considering the free housing.", "NTA\n\nShe fully knows she moved into a room that was intended for a nanny. As she fulfilled that role for two years. It is unfair for her to now demand a change to the arrangement. Especially since this would be at a heavy cost to you.     \n\n\nThey are also an adult who has been paid a nice hourly rate between 3pm and 12am, without any rent being charged. What were they doing with that money? After two years they could have something set aside. Tuition isn't cheap but holy have they squandered a great opportunity if they can't be ready to move out in three months.", "NTA. You need to get a lawyer to draft an official move out document with a 30 day date. Her parents are going to tell her to just stay and call your bluff because \"FaMilY\". Don't let her screw you and your kids over.", "NTA\n\n \n\n>They feel I should try to find a nanny who\u2019d be willing to drive home at 12:30 AM\n\n Or they could pay for their kid to live somewhere else. You gave her free rent for 2 years, since you paid her to work as a nanny.", "NTA. The living arrangement was for the *Nanny,* a position that your niece was filling. It was NOT made for your *Niece,* specifically.  If your niece is quitting the Nanny job, then that means she is also giving up the accouterments that came with it.  It sounds like she is mis-remembering or just plain rewriting the terms of the arrangement to suit herself. Regardless, this is a problem that she has created for herself through wrong assumptions and lack of planning. Stand your ground - it's her problem to solve, not your burden to shoulder.", "NTA - she had a double great deal - you gave housing and competitive pay. Now she\u2019s moving on but doesn\u2019t want to give up free housing - such a shame she and her mother are being childish and don\u2019t understand you need the room for the next nanny.", "NTA\n\nI doubt you will find a Nanny willing to work those hours and then drive home late at night.\n\nStart interviewing and make it clear to your Niece she has to be gone by the time the new Nanny starts.\n\nShe is a big girl she can live in Halls with the other students.", "Nta. So you need to find a nanny that doesn't want to live with you.  This would upset your whole lives. Your nice agreed to be the nanny if she could live rent free and get be a your paid nanny.  Now she wants to end your agreement and wants you to sacrifice you family routine so she doesn't have to change anything in her life?  Tell her you will be charging $1000 a month plus utilities and food if she stays. Is your whole family so self centered. It is your job to put your children and your life before what niece and sister want. Stand up or be walked on your choice.", "NTA\n\nYou agreed to let her live with you while she was your nanny. She's now trying to continue to live with you rent free, while preventing you from having space for a nanny.", "NTA. A mutually beneficial arrangement has come to a natural end.", "NTA- Aside from free housing, she was paid an overly fair wage that most would consider livable income (totally depends on area of course). If she did not manage her personal finances properly, it would be difficult to make this transition but that\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault. \nUltimately, the niece may find herself in a bind but has no right to point the finger at anyone but herself for not creating an emergency fund. It almost comes across as entitlement, because it\u2019s her situation that\u2019s changing not OP\u2019s.", "NTA\n\nShe moved in with a specific understanding that the terms would be mutually beneficial. She changed the terms and the agreement is no longer mutually beneficial. So she lives elsewhere. Seems clear.", "nta. the room is for a live in nanny. she is no longer a live in nanny. \n\ntry this: look up the price for such a room in your area. tell your niece that if she really wants to live there, she will have to pay that rent. \n\nor just tell her a date to be out by. tbh demanding free housing because otherwise she \u201cwon\u2019t be able to save as much\u201d left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. your life does not, cannot, revolve around your niece. you have kids of your own. if your sil feels so strongly that her daughter should live rent free she can pay her daughter\u2019s rent once she moves out. \n\ngood luck with your search for a new nanny.", "NTA\n\nShe entered an agreement with terms, so she should not be surprised to be bound by them.", "NTA. You are supporting YOUR children. Your niece's parents need to support their child. You hired her for a job that included a place to live, she's leaving the job, the place is no longer hers. If she worked at Wal-Mart and quit, she would no longer be able to drink the free coffee in the breakroom. She had a good situation, but she is choosing a different option, which is reasonable for her career, but it isn't your job to house her.", "Nta. You've been paying her $600 a week, plus free food and housing, for two years, and she's not been able to save ANYTHING?", ">She wanted to save cost on dorms and offered to watch my kids those 3 days, if she could live there rent free\n\nShe, herself, set the condition of her living there rent free.    \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Her being the nanny in exchange for housing was the deal. It's still the deal.  She basically now wants to live with you rent free while you have to figure out to manage a new nanny.  Nope.   You're not responsible for helping her save money by giving her a free place to stay.  You have your own kids to worry with and she needs to find other living arrangements.", "She apparently understands the requirements for the internship and is willing to commit to that knowing it would prevent her from keeping her agreement with you to be the nanny.   Contract is being broken by her, why should you be expected to continue your part?  Entitled child person in college", "NTA. She is quitting her job so she loses her room & board benefit. What if she nannied for a stranger? Would she and her parents expect the former employer to continue to give her free room & board? Your niece, brother and SIL are being greedy and selfish. Your only concern is your children not your niece. She has two parents to help her. Your kids only have you. Hire a live-in nanny and move niece out.", "Nta - she and her mom only feel it\u2019s unfair because they no longer get things slanted in their favour.", "NTA. Your terms for her staying there were clear from the beginning and she agreed. She can no longer fulfill her end of the agreement, so then its reasonable for you not to continue your end. If she quit a job, she wouldnt expect the employer to keep paying her a salary would she? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltimately it is your house, so its your choice.", "NTA- She moved in under the condition that she be a nanny to your kids. That's a verbal contract. Since she can't do it anymore, she has to move out.", "I had Y T A wound up after the title, but no.   NTA.\n\nThat spare room is for the nanny.  And, as you're already seen, most nannie aren't going to want to drive home so late.", "NTA. The terms of her living with you were clear and based upon her being a nanny. It is especially reasonable considering the fact that all of the nannies you've spoken to have clearly expressed that they are not willing to drive home that late.", "NTA. Your live-in nanny is quitting so will move. Her parents are at liberty to pay for housing elsewhere", "NTA.\n\nShe offered to watch your kids 3 days a week, and be paid $22/hr, in exchange for free lodging. Why on earth does she expect to continue living there when she knows you planned to use the room for the nanny?\n\nIt's rich that she and her parents think it isn't \"fair\" for you, a single mom,  to hire a live in nanny, instead of providing free housing to your adult niece. WTF!", "NTA- she doesnt get to have  a say in who uses your guest room.  If you need a nanny for child care then that is what you do. She is getting it very easy really.. 3 days of work, free room and gets paid for it.", "NTA, her living with you was contingent on being your nanny. It's no secret you desire having a live in nanny and need the guest room to do so. You are also offering to help your niece find a new place to stay.", "NTA.  She doesn't want to perform the job.  You need the room.  Period.  Doesn't even matter if she can or can't afford a place of her own yet alone save money.  It isn't your responsibility to provide for her.  That's her responsibility as an adult and her parents if they wish to take on that role.  You are a mother of 2 working and doing the best you can.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't warn you about this prospect.\n\nShe could have been saving.\n\nMaybe her parents will have to pay up to help her rather than holding you responsible.\n\nYou have been more than generous to her.", "NTA.  You set the conditions out clearly at the start.  It is not up to you to find any solution for your niece.  You gave clear requirements for your children\u2019s care.  Ensure you give your niece proper written notice to vacate.", "NTA. You treated her more than fairly. Now you have to do what is best for your kids. It\u2019s not your job to financially support her by giving her a free place to stay.", "NTA\n\nAnd i don't see why your niece is so upset. \n\nThe deal was nanny service for free housing and a wage. Even if she would keep living with you, stop working as the nanny you would charge her markt rate for rent anyway - so how is it different for her to which landlord she pays rent? Or did she expect to keep not only housing, but FREE housing? That would be very entitled. \n\nIf you have friends around who would be willing to rent her a room for cheap its oc nice to ask them. But she can't occupy the nanny room any longer if she isn't a nanny anymore. Or you can try to find a nanny at the campus nearby. Students often are awake studying long and if you raise the wage a little i'm sure you will find a student who will gladly take the job while keep living on campus. But i would still expect your niece to pay rent for continuing living with you. \n\nBut i guess your situation is just another example why you shouldn't mix family and business. Family becomes entitled very very fast...", "Well, damn, I'm sure that you, too, would prefer to be Rich Auntie Moneybags! I bet you'd love to let your niece stay in your house for free, but that's not feasible. You have children, a job, and a responsibility to look after your kids.\n\nYour sister and niece are being incredibly unreasonable. You had an employment offer, she took it, and it worked out for both of you. This was always a symbiotic relationship, not a grand favor. \n\n**NTA**", "NTA. The conditions were very clear. It sucks for your neice, but your kids needs come first. The spare bedroom is for the use of the Nanny. Period.", "NTA.   The free accommodation  came as part of her job as a nanny, and is now needed for her replacement since she isn\u2019t going to be working for you anymore.    If she was working for anyone else there\u2019d be no question of giving up all perks of employment when she quit.", "NTA, she moved in as a nanny and has now decided not to be a nanny\n\npossible nannies have all declined the fun and very late drive, so needs to be a live in", "Nta. Good for you for getting the lease agreement!", "NTA - you need the room for the nanny. Your niece is no longer going to be the nanny, therefore she moves out. It is not your problem that she will not have as much money.", "NTA,  the housing is tied to the employment.\n\nShe no longer wants the job, but wants to keep the free room? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.\n\nTry doing that with any other job with tied housing. I'm sure the military would just let you live rent free in their accommodation after you left the job.\n\n\nIt's time she joined the workd of being an adult. Of course your sister is going to side with her daughter  not your problem.", "Ask her to move out. No nanny will want to stay so late. But I don\u2019t understand would t your niece come home after work so 5 or 6pm? Why wouldn\u2019t the nanny not be able to leave like at 8pm?", "NTA and the arrangement was that she would be a live in nanny, not just get free rent while in school. Where's your brother in all this or is the SIL the only parent?  Obviously things would change at some point as she gets going in her career or has internships like she has. Her situation has changed so she needs to find a new place to live.", "Nta the room was hers on the condition she work for you, now you need it back. Nothing against your niece but she\u2019s just being selfish and only looking at it from her poV", "NTA.  You have been beyond fair and your sister and niece are expecting you to subsidized her wants at the cost of you and your children's needs.", "NTA but the math is confusing me. \n\nYou were giving her a free place to live, which is a big chunk of change, AND you were paying her $22/h so over $600 a WEEK, even though for about 40% of the time the kids would be in bed?\n\nAnd now she and her mom think it's \"unfair\" that you don't house her kid for free while she gets paid elsewhere? What planet do these 2 live on exactly?", "NTA!   \nYour conditions were very reasonable and clear from the beginning, you need the room for the new nanny and she needs to accept this and find a new option that works for her", "NTA. Your house, you need to do what works for your closest family. Where is all the money she saved up/earned for 2 whole years? And her internship is payed for, so she has better footing than most. How entitled thinking she should just keep living there for her own benefit only.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA - your niece wants to save at your expense.\n\nHelp her find accomodation.", "NTA. Free room and board + $22/hr is a very, very sweet deal. Now she wants free room and board in exchange for nothing? She\u2019s your adult niece, not your minor child. Put yourself and your children first.", "NTA\n\nBut, may I suggest offering to let your niece stay if she starts paying rent? You could then pay the new (not live-in) nanny more money for the hassle of working late shifts. Plenty of people (yourself included) work odd hours.\n\nIt may be good for the kids to have the consistency of your niece being around, especially while they transition to a new nanny.  Good luck!", "You\u2019re definitely NTA you need to make sure your children are taken care of. However, I\u2019m just wondering if you need a nanny to stay till midnight. It\u2019s just assuming your niece\u2019s internship maintains regular office hours, she\u2019d be home most likely between 6pm & 8pm, at which point she could relieve the nanny, allowing the other nanny to drive home at a decent hour. Since you live near the college she probably could even find one of her friends to take care of the kids between 3-7ish pm for a semester. Just an alternative to consider", "NTA. The room is predicated on providing nannying. No other thing to say.", "How long is the internship? Could you both go back to your previous arrangement after it's over?\n\nEither way NTA", "NTA this situation worked until it doesn\u2019t. You are responsible for the children you gave birth to not your niece. It is not your responsibility to make her finances better because it\u2019s convenient for her. \nIf you had not been related and hired her for the job would your SIL call her boss and demand that she continue to live there rent free, No because it would be completely ridiculous. So it is no different.", "NTA - That was the agreement you offered in the beginning, rent for babysitting plus hourly pay on top.  She can no longer babysit with this internship and you can no longer give her a room to live in.  You need that for another live-in.  What is so complicated for her on that?  Tell her you have a home and not a flophouse.", "No. You are NTA. It\u2019s wonderful that your niece has all this going , but your children\u2019s needs supersedes hers, and you have clearly stated live-in plus cash = nanny services on agreed upon days/times.", "NTA.. you were up front from day one. She nor her parents should expect you to choose her over what\u2019s best for your children..", "NTA. Tell her that she will either have to pay rent, which in turn would go to a nanny's apartment nearby, or she has to leave, period. Tell her that if she doesn't leave by a certain date, you will have to evict her, and that she won't be able to find a place to rent with an eviction on her record. She can't have it both ways, where she is saving money or spending more on herself, while you have to struggle and ask others to sacrifice.\n\nThe room is for the nanny. She is being selfish, and not thinking about you, your kids, or your prospective nanny. I was also widowed when my kids were little, and finding decent, reliable child care is difficult and can be exhausting. She is making it harder on you to do your job as a mother.", "NTA.  But if your niece can still watch your kids on those three days from the time she gets home until 12:30am, the nanny, or babysitter really, can leave when niece arrives.   No need for there to be two adults in the house each capable of watching the kids.  In this scenario niece can stay.", "What hours would she he working at the internship??  Maybe nanny could work till niece gets back, then niece takes over and nanny can go home earlier??  Maybe nanny could just stay thru dinner...then she would not heed a room???  Just a thought", "NTA.\n\nYou've already done been extremely generous to her by giving her 2 years of free housing. Now that she's getting a paid job, it's perfectly reasonable for her to expect to pay for her own housing. She should be thanking you for your kindness instead of complaining that she can't continue to get free housing. Life doesn't work like that.\n\nBased on your SIL's response, would I be correct in assuming an \"apple doesn't fall far from the tree\" connection happening here?\n\nWith that said, if you are able to accommodate your niece, it would be nice of you to do so. But it's definitely not required. Ie if you have a basement and your niece would be willing to sleep down there, maybe y'all could make it work. I've slept in a sleeping bag in a friend's basement before, but that was only for a few days.", "NTA, but tread carefully.\n\nYou and your niece both had a live-in situation that worked well for both of you.  Since she's been there over two years, she has probably grown fond of you and the kids.  Respect that.\n\nCan your niece watch the kids AFTER she gets home from her internship?  You may only need child-care until 6 at night, for instance.  If that's the case, get a babysitter until your niece gets home from her internship.\n\nIf your niece is still going to be in the area, that seems like the most sensible solution to me.", "Absolutely NTA.  Your niece wants to have her cake and eat it too.  She was happy enough to live rent free and be paid for nannying, but as soon as she got a different deal for herself, she doesn't care how it impacts you.  \n\nShe needs to put on her big girl pants and live on her earnings and give you back your guest/nanny room.", "NAH.  No h of you have conflicting needs.  She sat your kids as a favour, but it was never part of her career plan.  She is young and probably should have had some conversations with you earlier in her search for an internship (or you/ her parents should have thought about what was potentially next for her too), but being young, never thought of it.\n\nAs an alternative, can't she pay rent and you use this to subsidize the cost of a non-live in nanny.  I know lost don't want to drive home that late, but surely there are others at her college that could use some cash (and maybe the \"sleep time\" as study time).\n\nSince no-one is being malicious, maybe just open a conversation and see what you can all do by putting your heads together.", "NAH\n\nYou have specific needs\n\nYour niece also has specific needs \n\nBut this will definitely ruin the relationship between you and her", "NAH. But in the end, your situation matters to you more than hers does. And she CAN afford an apartment. It's just less convenient, and she doesn't want to. Makes sense from her side, too. SIL can kick rocks. She's not putting out the money for her kid's room and board.", "YTA. Not for not being able to house her anymore when you need to hire a nanny, but I'll be honest, it sounds like you were never clear upfront on the fact you saw her as hired help who could only stay as long as she was in your employ and not a family member that you were housing as part of a favour exchange. I'm willing to bet she was expecting the conversation to go along the lines of \"I'm not available at those times anymore because I have an internship now\"-- \"Okay, how about instead of helping with the childcare, you help with XYZ or pay ABC boarding rent amount instead?\"", "Info.
