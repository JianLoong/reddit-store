{"id": 29890, "submission_id": "17j12bt", "title": "AITA for explaining to my kids that their half brother feeling the way he does is sometimes part of life?", "selftext": "My husband and I are raising three kids. My husband was married before me and he has a son, Cole (16m) from his first marriage. Cole's mom died 11 years ago and my husband and I met 9 years ago and married 7 years ago. Together my husband and I have a daughter Freya (6) and Theo (5). Cole has never really accepted me as family or the kids. He's not unkind but disinterested in us, but especially the kids. It's not that he doesn't like kids. He's great with other kids.\n\nCole was in therapy after his mom died and we did family therapy together before my husband and I married. He never spoke against the marriage or us having kids. But he's not very warm toward us either. It really shows with the kids more because they really want to be closer to him. They want him to take the same interest in them as he does in other kids. They have seen him with his friends much younger siblings and with young cousins and with kids in the neighborhood.\n\nMy husband and I don't push too hard. I will take Cole to pick up a video game every few weeks because he loves gaming and I ask him questions about the games he enjoys as a way of trying to bond. We also go to arcades, the pool and we go for walks all together.\n\nYesterday I was taking the kids to a Halloween party and Freya asked me why Cole doesn't like them and I asked what she meant. She said she asked why he likes other kids more than them and he told her they don't have the same mom. Theo didn't really understand most of it but Freya understood enough to be upset. She was crying and Theo was confused more than anything. This all came up because Freya wanted to show off her costume to Cole but he wasn't interested. Yet he does show interest in other kids' costumes.\n\nI told them sometimes, when a kid ends up with their parents no longer together and they fight a lot or when a kid loses their mommy or daddy young like Cole lost his mommy, it means they find it hard to let some people into their heart. That Cole lost his mommy and it made it harder for him to feel about us the way we feel about him. Freya said her best friend has a sister who has a different dad but she loves her. I told her it doesn't happen all of the time and sometimes it gets better but that how Cole feels does happen at times and all we can do is try to accept it and respect the way he feels. I also told them it was not their fault, at all.\n\nMy husband wasn't home at the time but when he did I told him what happened. His parents were also home because they wanted to see the kids all dressed up. They heard what I told my husband and they told me I should never have said that to the kids because I should know Cole isn't being fully honest when he says things about not loving them and I will make the kids think it's true when they're so little and too young to really understand the complexities and I made it so black and white for them.\n\nMy husband told his parents they needed to leave. But they called me a bad mom before they left.

Your explanation was perfect and age appropriate. An honest answer beats the tap dancing, side stepping, smoke up the crack answer your in laws could have tried giving your kids.", "NTA - explaining the rough parts of life to little kids is hard. Sounds like you tried your best, and didn't trash Cole.", "NTA\n\nYou tried your best to explain the situation to a child and you did it WITHOUT being negative about the one who\u2019s being sooo negative. \n\nIs he still in therapy? If not, I suggest restarting, because he needs to learn a bit of humility where his siblings are concerned. I\u2019m not saying he needs to \u201clove\u201d them, but he certainly needs to stop giving off \u201chate\u201d vibes, cause they\u2019re not to blame for his loss.", "NTA You are doing your best in a tough spot. \n\nI feel like I read a post from Cole's perspectives not too long ago where he was disinterested in the family and the mom (not his mom, but the step-mom) was mad at him for not having more of an interest. I remember the comments suggesting family therapy. I wonder if Freya might ready for this to help her sort out her feelings.", "NTA.  I think you explained it in an age-appropriate way.  At this point, the younger kids may also benefit from therapy.", "NTA you are a good Mom. You respect Coles bounderies and don't pressure him which Most likely will destroy every Kind of relationship you have. \n\nIt is hard for the Kids but you should try Therapy for the Younger ones. They need help to understand that sometimes you can't force feelings even to close Family members", "NTA. Contrary to your in-laws unsolicited opinions, I think you are handling this spectacularly. You are respecting Cole's boundaries, meeting him where he's at and you explained to your kids how Cole feels in an age-appropriate way.", "NTA. You did a great job explaining things to your kids and your in-laws are dead wrong. Kids that age NEED more black and white than shades of grey and that's what you gave them. \n\nHave you considered therapy again? You mentioned that Cole had it before and that you had family therapy at one point but that was before you married 7 years ago. 16 is a tough age for anyone and it seems like Cole is feeling alienated from the rest of you. Might be worth giving it another go.", "NTA. I think that the way you addressed your daughters concerns was perfect. You managed to respect and acknowledge that Cole's feelings were valid and understandable while also giving your daughter age appropriate context so that she can understand it's not personal, more situational.\n\nYou also didn't deny her suspicions which is what many people would do in this situation. You gave her space to outline the issue and then addressed it in a way that avoided painting anybody as the bad guy, while still remaining honest. Good job!", "NTA, you explained the situation for what it is to your children. I think it's the best you could have done, although difficult, instead of feeding them some other answer that spares their feelings and keeps them hoping for something that might not happen in terms of bonding/affection from their half brother. I sincerely feel you were an amazing parent in this case don't listen to your in-laws.", "Your explanation was very clear, delicate, and respectful of Cole and your kids. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are the opposite of a bad mom. You are a great mom, and a great stepmother.

Your in-laws are way out of line. Don't give their ridiculous, damaging attitude another thought.", "Nta. I think you did a good job of explaining it. That said, I think it\u2019s time for some family therapy with Cole and his Dad. Maybe in there he should bring up what his sister said. This will get harder for all of them as they get older. Cole can love his mother and cherish her memories. He can also love his new family additions and realize these people are here for him but eventually won\u2019t be if this continues. He has two siblings that love him. They may eventually be his only family when he\u2019s old. He can grow that bond or destroy it.", "I think you explained it beautifully to your children. Your in-laws don\u2019t get a vote or a voice in how you explain Cole\u2019s behavior to his younger half-siblings. \n\nNTA", "NTA  Sounds like you handled things quite well and good for your husband to back you up.  Cole may never feel about his siblings the way others would prefer but that's neither right or wrong...it's just what it is.", "NTA You are doing an excellent job as a parent and stepparent. Being kind but real about a situation like this doesn\u2019t make things worse; living in denial sure can, though. You have a lot of wisdom and compassion. Calling you a bad mother over kindly helping your child understand a painful reality is deeply ironic.", "NTA. I really don\u2019t see how you could\u2019ve explained it any better than how you did. It\u2019s the truth and you broke it down so your younger kids could understand and you are very understanding to his situation as well.", "YTA.  6 years old is way too young to understand the intricacies of relationships and trauma. Teenagers can be aloof but are still developing, and now his little sister thinks he can't ever love her.

It\u2019s easy to be the coolest teenager in the world to a kid if you only have to be accessible for 15 minutes. At 16 privacy and maturity and peace and quiet were huge needs for me because it was a stressful time. Having 5 and 6 year olds in the house might just be genuinely stressful for him at times. I would also remind your kids that at 16 different things are important to him right now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess 1 small info request, how have Freya and Theo never heard of Cole\u2019s mom?

Quite frankly, his outright treatment of them is appalling. \n\nHe treats them worse than strangers and your young children have noticed this. They\u2019ve noticed that they are LESS to him than random strangers. If he was disinterested in all children they wouldn\u2019t notice, but he seems to go out of his way to treat strangers kinder than he does them. \n\nIt may be time to revisit family therapy. Your young children are being harmed by this dynamic, and they deserve a voice and help to process this. You did a phenomenal job right now, but this feeling of rejection and abandonment will continue to grow as they continue to witness themselves being less. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t need to treat them like they are super close siblings. But he shouldn\u2019t be treating them so noticeably different than he treats random kids in the neighbourhood.", "NTA\nYou handled that beautifully.\nHis parents just don\u2019t want it to be true.", "NTA better to be honest with children then lie and have them find out later", "Nta maybe talk to a therapist to find the best way to have your younger kids process these emotions. It sounded like you did the best thing in the moment which is to teach your kids that sometimes people\u2019s experiences make it hard for them to do something that would make you feel better and it\u2019s okay. This is also a good way to teach your kids resilience when someone doesn\u2019t like them.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t tell your kids Cole doesn\u2019t love them, just that it\u2019s harder. That feels like a very age appropriate way to describe the situation", "NYA. Good for your husband for backing you up over his nosey parents. You handled it perfectly with your daughter and showed a lot of empathy for your step son. Good on you", "Nta. You explained this as best as you could while placing no blame on anyone.

You did your best to explain a very complicated situation, without invalidating anyone\u2019s feelings or blaming anyone. Your ILs need to butt out.", "NTA\n\nI think you handled the situation as well as anyone could have.\n\nAnd I think teaching your kids (as your inlaws suggested) that someone clearly not interested in them really loves them deep down would be dangerous lesson for them to carry into the bigger world.", "NTA\n\n\"Blended\" families don't always blend. You did well to try to temper expectations and explain. You sound like a good mom and step-mom. \n\nCole may warm up, or he might always keep the halves at a distance. Age difference and sharing space might effect his attitude, as well.\n\nHope the grands don't pressure the kid.", "NTA - as my mum always says, \"If they're old enough to ask they're old enough to know the answer\"\n\nYou answered this beautifully and if you can get your husband on the same page, you'll end up with emotionally mature adults\n\nRespecting everyone's feelings and understanding that not all families are the same is really important", "This is the easiest NTA of the day. You brought me to tears, not only for how much Cole is obviously still hurting, but for how you respond to him and explained his demeanor to your other kids. \n\nMy parents adopted 2 kids several years ago and it took a long time for my siblings and I to adjust to the change and to those kids. My younger siblings have some resentment towards the 2 because they were very poorly behaved and my parents attention was focused mainly on them for many years. Not only that, they felt like their space was \u201cinvaded\u201d and they were forced to love and share everything with complete strangers. \n\nSo I can understand why Cole is having a hard time. For many years of his life all he knew was his dad and mom, and then just his dad. There could also be some jealously that his siblings have both their mom and dad and he doesn\u2019t. The grandparents need to understand that for some, loving ppl doesn\u2019t always come naturally but especially for someone who has a lot of trauma.", "Most definitely YANTA and it sounds like you\u2019re doing the very best possible with a difficult situation. Making up stories for kids that are really just lies adults tell children when WE aren\u2019t comfortable being honest with them is a mistake. Kids will let us know what they\u2019re ready to know or discuss. The best thing is to be honest but keep your answers narrow to their actual questions. Freya did a great job of let you know that she was ready for more than she could figure out on her own. Your in-laws, in their attempt to protect Freya from something she is obviously ready to discuss, are blaming you for not lying about Cole\u2019s feelings. \n\nThis is difficult because Cole is still a child but you have to temper your tolerance for his feelings with his treatment of his siblings. He should be encouraged to be honest but not hurtful. Other people on the planet exist, too, and are entitled to be treated with a certain basic level of decency and respect. Cole gets to feel what he feels but he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to take it out on people that are innocent. \n\nSometimes people want answers but it\u2019s important to remember that yes, no, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not ready to talk about that, and I\u2019m not ready to talk about that with you can all be valid answers to questions. For instance, it\u2019s OK for Cole to be angry that his mother died so young, when he was so young. It is not OK for Cole to behave resentfully toward his siblings because he wishes his mother were still alive and any siblings he had was through his mom and dad instead of his dad and you. That would be an example of misplaced grief. \n\nMaybe in expecting and requiring appropriate behavior from Cole \u2014 which you may already be doing and getting from him at least at a minimal level \u2014 and in helping your kids that are his half siblings deal with the uncertainty of how Cole feels about them and everything else, including recognizing the possibility with them that Cole might not even be clear how he feels or why he feels that way. It could be a way of bridging topics such as \u201cyou know how that time you felt frustrated about things but you weren\u2019t sure why or what was wrong or what anyone could do to help you? Well Cole feels like that but in a bigger way since his mommy died. He may still very trying to figure out his feelings because that\u2019s a pretty tough thing to have to go through and most people don\u2019t lose their mommy or daddy until they\u2019re a lot older, even older sometimes than grandma and grandpa.\u201d It\u2019s an honest response, it doesn\u2019t attempt to resolve the situation, and it let\u2019s your daughter know that sitting with uncertainty can be a part of life that Cole is having to deal with in his way as Freya is having to deal with it in her own way dealing with the uncertainty about Cole\u2019s feelings and her.", "NTA, it was a difficult question your daughter asked and I think you handled it well providing that answer on the spot", "NTA. How wonderfully understanding of you towards Cole. This shows a lot of insights. Pushing/enforcing it only makes things worse. And the smaller kids... Even though they cannot fully comprehend, it's good to show them that nobody is at fault here. Not them and also not Cole. It will help them accept the situation.", "NTA. i was coles age when my mom remarried and had more kids. Being a teenager with super young siblings is really really tough! But now they're graduating high school and I wish I was closer to hang out with them. Sending yall good vibes and hope they all understand things take time.", "NTA OP.", "NTA\n\nYou gave them a real answer instead of trying to wallpaper over the feeling like his parents tried to do.", "NTA - there are a lot of emotions inside Cole and I think your explanation was great. Your InLaws have no idea what is going on in your house in the day to day nor in your therapy sessions. They didn\u2019t need to call you a bad mom for that. Like WTH. \n\nGlad your hubs had your back. So many don\u2019t on here.", "NTA. Not even slightly. \n\nI grew up in a similar situation. My dad left our lives when I was 5, and my mom remarried when I was 10. My stepdad brought his daughter into the mix and she was very distant to me and my sister and also to my mom. I questioned this and my mom explained it to me almost exactly the way that you did. I was upset because I didn't understand it. But as I got older and started having more \"life\" experiences, it started to make sense. I was very grateful that I had known the answer before it made sense to me, I feel like I was able to have more feelings and sympathy toward my stepsister's situation. Eventually my stepsister came around, but it took YEARS. Kids process things on their own terms and they don't know how to express their feelings and emotions like an adult does. I think as long as you continue to support him and show him that you are someone he can trust, he eventually may come around. Cudos to you for being supportive toward him and allowing him to do this on his own terms. Your IL can jump in a lake. You handled this perfectly.", "NTA you explained to your kids as best as you can and they deserve the truth as hard as it is. I do feel for them, it must suck. I feel for Cole too I can\u2019t imagine how he\u2019s feeling. His parents were completely out of line. This must be some old head thinking because what you did was actually very healthy.", "NTA obviously. I'm not a therapist, but I wonder if Cole feels like he is betraying his dead mother by showing affection to his half siblings. He may not even be aware of why he's doing it", "NTA\n\nThey called you a bad mom, eh? Well, out the door and out of your.lives, I guess.", "Your in-laws are delusional.

You told the kids in a kid friendly and easy to understand way that they should get the picture. There is always the chance he starts trying to build a relationship with his half siblings but it can't be forced, and it's better they learn this now.", "NTA. When your daughter first asked the question, I was trying to think of how I would explain it. I came up blank. But your answer was age-appropriate and respectful. I can\u2019t imagine a better way to handle the situation than how you did it. Family is always complicated, especially when they are blended (coming from a blended family). You didn\u2019t blame anyone, explained reality, and respected Coles emotions and feelings.", "NTA - and, honestly, I think you handled the situation beautifully. Thanks for being a great (step)mom.", "NTA - Personally I think you\u2019re a great mom and a really understanding and supportive stepmother.", "NTA. Kids that are old enough and empathetic enough to notice such patterns and wonder about them, deserve and NEED to have these questions answered, and you did a good Job. It's nobody's fault and May or may Not ever Change, are the most important parts, and you conveyed those, and predending like brother's obvious Feelings are a Joke or a lie, insults the kids' intelligence and May make them distrust whoever sells it.", "You did such a good job in every aspect of parenting here, both as a mum and a step mum. I'm so happy to read a post involving a blended family with so much space and acceptance for everyone's feelings. This was perfect, and youre 100% NTA. Your husband also sounds awesome.", "NTA. You clearly respect Cole's feelings while his grandparents do not. They would have your kids cling to some false hope for a relationship that doesn't exist. Cole may love them, but he won't be able to love them they way that they want him to love them. You taught her to accept Cole's feelings without her taking on some kind of blame.

It's not his fault or bad. He is entitled to his feelings, and those feelings may be different from those of other friends who have stepparents. This is also why it's hard for Cole to be as warm at home- because being at home makes him feel sad sometimes, and his feelings are really complex.

If you\u2019ve been on AITA, then you know how your ILs strategy of lying and willful ignorance pans out\u2014it\u2019s never good and ends up with all parties more hurt than if they\u2019d just been told, listened to, believed the truth. \n\nYou told your kids the truth\u2014or as close to the truth you could get\u2014while still sparing their feelings and not completely throwing Cole under the bus.

Why do you feel the need to judge the boy at all? A sibling who is 10 and 11 years older than his younger siblings won't necessarily be close to them, whereas the younger ones will want to. Even just going be ages, the 16 year old could easily see the 6 & 5 year old as often-pestering annoyances or more work than fun; whereas visiting friends younger siblings is like being a grandparent where you can have a spot of fun and then skip out on the annoying stuff. \n\nThe issue isn't whether the older boy is broken in some fashion such that he's not fully functional. Maybe allow the teen to be himself, even if that's not as touchy-feely or huggy as you would like him to be. That's not necessarily the sign of someone to be judged as less than others. \n\nAlternatively, you're giving a second level analysis to something that has a first level answer. So, maybe you're right but you could easily be overlooking the easier answer. You're assuming that he's good with you because he hasn't told you he isn't.

Really odd assumption that he is all good with you & your kids, it's just that he hasn't gotten over his mom. Logically, if he hasn't gotten over losing his mom, he's not actually accepting you.  There are so many stories on this page about step parents assuming that the kids are or are on the path to buying into the blended family the way they do.

It always sucks to love someone who just cannot love you back the same way. I think Cole\u2019s chosen language of \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same mom\u201d is about as neutral as he can reasonably get. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to \u201cfake it till you make it\u201d if you\u2019re the adult and the person with real power in the situation. Like, for example, a stepparent (or even a parent!) could choose to behave in a loving way even if they\u2019re not \u201cfeeling the love\u201d in a given moment. But to push and push a teenager to fake a sense of kinship he just doesn\u2019t feel is probably going to make it even less likely for him to ever bond with his younger siblings.", "I think it's telling that Freya and Theo are roughly the same age as Cole was when he lost his own mom. It wouldn't surprise me if he was having bigger feelings than usual about these small kids who get to have up to two parents helping them with their costume and making the holiday special. Thinking back to his first Halloween without his mom is probably still painful; I wonder if his grieving dad even managed to do something special that year.\n\nI agree that his deep hurt doesn't justify unkindness, but he is still a child himself, and even adult do not always act well when they are dealing with big feelings.\n\nWhat OP has done to age-appropriately help the younger kids manage their own feelings is great - because people will hurt them in life, intentionally or not - and getting a professional to help Cole is important too.\n\nOP, if you see this, I think it's important to frame therapy in the right way for Cole: I didn't have this reaction, but my siblings did, that they were broken and unacceptable to the adults in their lives, and were being sent away to be fixed. He's not being sent to therapy because you want him to be kinder to his siblings, or even because you don't want him to be sad or angry. He gets to go to therapy because you love him and want to give him a safe place to acknowledge all of his completely reasonable messy feelings without having to worry about being polite or kind for a bit. A change in his feelings or behaviour towards his siblings would be nice, but his feelings about the unchangeable unfairness of his situation are the issue for therapy.\n\nIn my spiritual tradition, it's customary to have photographs of departed loved ones at the evening meal on the 31st, and honour their memories through stories. It may be too raw at this point - I could see lots of ways that Cole could respond negatively to it being brought up suddenly, or to \"sharing\" his mom with the new family - but I wonder if Cole's mom could be a greater presence in the household generally, so that the siblings see Cole and dad doing things to remember her and can gain more insight and empathy into his situation.", "He isn't angry, he just doesn't love them. No theraphy in the world will fix that. This family wouldn't exist If his mom wasn't dead. I really don't see where he was angry/mean with the children. The kids are sad because he doesn't show interest on them like they wanted.", "I've been through a similar situation, my take was that the older sibling didn't have to cater to the younger ones or force themselves to do anything they didn't want to do, but there's a big difference between being honest and being cruel. \n\nI disagree about OP. Her and her husband need to address with Cole the fact that he's nearly grown and regardless of how he feels there is ZERO reason to be cruel to a child that young *regardless of who the child is*. They're protecting Cole, they're understanding him, but they're not guiding him, and at this point it's important for him to know that innocent people aren't punching bags for his negative feelings- especially little kids that look up to him.", "If you had told them something like that it wouldn't just be lies from you to them but it would be telling them that Cole is lying and their own eyes and ears and feelings are lying also. It would do nothing but degrade trust in all the above. Old-school parenting has some things right and some wrong. Just telling children how they should feel doesn't work.

Cole is gonna have a v triggering, v rude awakening when this happens.\n\nThere's a real chance he never comes around, and there's no emotional fall out he has to deal with.

I mean, how many stories do we get on this sub from the younger siblings' perspective 10 years later of their older sibling wanting a relationship after never acknowledging them?\n\nLet Cole have his feelings, there's no need to change him, but it would also be kind to prepare him for the fact that if his behavior continues, his siblings won't be there for him when he's older.", "I asked because I have a half-sibling in a different situation. I will keep the details basic, but they were adopted out long before I was born. For them, treating half-siblings as full siblings is not a default, as it diminishes their adoptive family. That's not your situation, but I wonder if it's something similar.\n\nThe other thing is my half sibling is nothing like any of the other half-siblings on either side except me. They and I are the only ones that act like full siblings because we are very similar and made the positive choice that we wanted to be siblings.

One day, she told me something to the effect was it wasn't that I was a bad kid, I was a good kid and my mother was very stressed out.

Basically, they contributed to a person who became a classic, \"hurt people hurt people\" kind of person.  She experienced many difficulties in life because of this.\n\nI don't think it's OP's place to hold him accountable, but his father or grandparents could gently hold him accountable.

It made it so much worse that my parents insisted that it was \"mean\" not to like her and not to include her at all times (of course, it never went both ways because as the older sibling it was my responsibility, but as the younger, she was entitled to be left alone to her activities and with her friends).  We might have eventually gotten along better if my parents had left us alone and let us naturally catch up more in development and be more inclined to spend time and have common interests, as the age gap wasn't massive, such as when we were both teenagers.

His reason for not liking them is << *and he told her they don't have the same mom.*\\>>  He is using this to explain why he doesn't like his half siblings but likes his friends' siblings--His friends' siblings don't have the same mother EITHER.  It's a BS reason.\n\n  Your explanation was better than his.  At least it was truthful.  That said, his truthful reason would likely have been hurtful too.

Sometimes you try to bond by taking him to things like you're taking a dog on a walk?\n\nSaying he's sad about his mom is the easy cop out.

But so is Cole. No, of course he can't be required to feel any huge brotherly love for his half-siblings. But if he can show interest and warmth towards any other random kids, then he can fucking well show at least as much towards them; if he doesn't see them as siblings then they're just like any other random kids to him. Not doing so is just utterly assholeish(1). Has nobody \u2013 like, their father \u2013 pointed this out to him? If not, it's high time somebody did.

Including a step son who doesn\u2019t seem to like you much. \n\nHowever just a little bit YTA because you\u2019re making a lot of assumptions about what this kid is thinking and the motivations for his behavior. His distance may be his way of preventing pain, because what he learned at a young age is that family dies and it hurts. A lot. Stop assuming that you (as an adult) can possibly, truly understand what he\u2019s thinking - children think differently, espc re: cause and effect, and how the world works. \n\nAnd get him back in therapy. He needs an impartial ally.", "OP's Husband needs to sit Cole down and remind him of the Golden Rule. Teenagers are jerks by design, but that doesn't mean that it's not the parent's responsibility to not reign in and guide the proto-adult to maturity. It might help Cole to understand the impact of his (re)actions to remind him that his siblings, who are *preschoolers*, are the same age now that he was when his Mom passed. If someone treated him back then like he's treating Freya and Theo now, how would Cole react if he heard/saw it? If he's a good kid (and it seems like he is), he'd probably think it was \"bullshit/messed up\". \nHe doesn't need to like them, but he does need to not rub his indifference in their faces.

As adults we get along fine and has always been there for us. Even our mom confided to me that she didn't think he liked her. I told her, that's just the way he is, he treats everyone that way. It made her feel a lot better. Now we are all much older and he's never changed, but he usually shows up when invited, and is always helpful if he can help. At least Cole seems to like other people.", "No, but I think family therapy for the younger children with at least Op and husband would be helpful and proactive.", "I totally agree with that he's old enough to know his actions have affects on other people. It takes nothing to be kind to a preschooler.", "And that is very damaging to your kids and there emotionally well being.", "I'd be keeping a closer eye on those inlaws if it were me.

He's definitely old enough to know how being nice & friendly towards random kids but stonewalling his own siblings comes across. He's nearly an adult, and an important part of being an adult is learning how to be polite and civil towards people even if you don't particularly like them. Also, he's going to learn the hard way that the majority of people won't care what sort of trauma you have if it means you're acting like an asshole towards them, it's not a free pass. He doesn't have to love them, but it wouldn't kill him to at least be nice.", "For most Cole-excusing commenters, it's the trauma of having lost his mother (over half a lifetime ago, for him), but you've come up with a new one. Sure, your \u201cimplicit pressure\u201d _could_ of course be the explanation... But a wise old man called William of Ockham once recommended when looking for explanations, the simplest one is often the most correct. And since the fact is that Cole is consistently behaving like an asshole, which is the definition of being an asshole, the simplest explanation is that he actually is one.\n\nSo why do all you people feel this need to bend over backwards to come up with excuses for him, in stead of admitting the actual facts?\n\nOh hey, and by the way: Those aren't just \u201cOP's Kids\u201d, as you call them (and what's with the weird capitalisation?) \u2013 they're his father's, too.

We grew up together, did everything together, shared everything\u2026 and yet I\u2019m 1000x closer to my younger brother who is 8 years my junior. You can\u2019t predict it. My mum still gets sad when we talk about how meh my relationship with my older brother is. Often wish she would lay off and accept that forcing it helps no one", "I'll be the first to admit that my relationship with my younger sister (8.5 year age gap) was lacking, especially when we were younger. Like, I am sure she looked up to me a bit when she was 8 and I was 16, but I had basically no real time for her, and I didn't even have the complicated background that OP's kids have in this scenario. It's not that I didn't love my sister, but I definitely didn't really spend time with her or show it.\n\nIt's something I regret having grown older, but yeah. I think OP handled everything really well. We see so many stories of people who just assume their kids have no thoughts of their own and should just automatically get along, when real life is way more complicated than that.", "How hard is it? I find it excruciatingly hard to fake being interested in things I'm not interested in. Forcing myself to lie to make other people feel good just isn't in my nature. Being fake is bad for my mental health, and I'm pretty sure others know I'm faking, so why do it?", "Thank you! Everyone is sooooo worried about Cole that they are completely disregarding the feelings of the two younger kids who are clearly hurting. What Cole is doing is not okay.", "To me, it's very strange that they seem so hands-washing of the therapist who claims that Cole has no further goals in therapy. But later in a comment they mention that the therapist said Cole has to WANT to work towards a goal, implying that he didn't \"graduate\" from therapy he just stopped participating in it in a meaningful way. \n\nIt's definitely not kind to treat a 5 and 6-year-old this way and to have more affection and grace for neighborhood children than the children who live with you and love you. Cole doesn't have to reciprocate warm and fuzzy familial feelings if he doesn't feel them, but it's worth examining why he thinks he can never love them because they have a different mom and why he feels so comfortable letting the 6-year-old know that. This isn't a \"he doesn't like kids because he's a teen\" situation, he engages with other kids just not his own siblings.", "This is an amazing therapist.", "Also, Cole is like ten years older than his siblings. I have a six year gap with my little brother, and we weren't that close until  the summer before I went to college, and our relationship started growing more and more close after that. Big age gaps can make bonding hard even if there's no other trauma involved.", "Except he shows interest in 5 & 6 yr old sibling of friends--this is his slap in the face to his Half-siblings.  With deliberate intent.\n\nAnd his reason was bogus--as his friend's siblings don't share a mother with him either.", ">but right now her two other kids don\u2019t\n\nHuh? It sounds like that's exactly what mom provided them when they felt some kinda way about Cole's response.\n\nSooner or later they'll have to learn that you can't force a relationship with another person, that rejection is always possible and it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. It sounds like their mother is doing her best to instill those lessons.", "He is pushing them away on purpose, but being hurtful on purpose is bad behavior and isn't excusable just because he's been through losing his mom. A lot of people don't have both parents and never act that way", "Cole doesn't have a problem with showing interest \u2013 genuine or feigned \u2013 in other kids.

You seem to be trying to let him have his cake and eat it.", "Are you a therapist? Are you Cole's therapist? If not, back off.  \n  \nTherapy is not a thing you force other people to do to fix your own gripes with them. Cole met the goals he had for his therapy. That's what matters. It sucks that he doesn't love his brother and sister the same way they love them. He's not doing anything wrong. From what I can tell, it seems like he has a lot of love in his heart for other kids. The terrible, horrible, unfortunate truth of the matter is that he doesn't have any for THESE kids. But you don't HAVE to love someone just because they're family.  \n  \nYou cannot force a person to feel the way you want them to.

How could we _not_ conclude that?!?\n\nYour very next sentence contradicts your first:\n\n> He seems to be neutral in his actions, maybe intentionally - like he doesn't dislike them, but he also doesn't have a relationship with them\n\nI don't dislike John Smith in Chicago. I also don't have a relationship with him. In fact, I don't know any John Smith at all, and I've never been to Chicago. (I put him there just because it's such a big place there's gotta be a John Smith there.) If you can't conclude from that that I don't love John Smith in Chicago there must be something wrong with you.\n\nAnd that's exactly what you ascribed to Cole in regard to his younger half-siblings: \u201cDoesn't dislike\u201d and \u201cdoesn't have a relationship with\u201d. That's pretty much the definition of \u201cdoesn't love\u201d.", "Therapy might be helpful, but suggesting Cole needs it feels like you're medicalising his emotions and choices.

The fact that Freya cried does not tell us that Cole was mean or cruel in his delivery. It's even possible he said it gently.
