{"id": 29890, "submission_id": "17j12bt", "title": "AITA for explaining to my kids that their half brother feeling the way he does is sometimes part of life?", "selftext": "My husband and I are raising three kids. My husband was married before me and he has a son, Cole (16m) from his first marriage. Cole's mom died 11 years ago and my husband and I met 9 years ago and married 7 years ago. Together my husband and I have a daughter Freya (6) and Theo (5). Cole has never really accepted me as family or the kids. He's not unkind but disinterested in us, but especially the kids. It's not that he doesn't like kids. He's great with other kids.\n\nCole was in therapy after his mom died and we did family therapy together before my husband and I married. He never spoke against the marriage or us having kids. But he's not very warm toward us either. It really shows with the kids more because they really want to be closer to him. They want him to take the same interest in them as he does in other kids. They have seen him with his friends much younger siblings and with young cousins and with kids in the neighborhood.\n\nMy husband and I don't push too hard. I will take Cole to pick up a video game every few weeks because he loves gaming and I ask him questions about the games he enjoys as a way of trying to bond. We also go to arcades, the pool and we go for walks all together.\n\nYesterday I was taking the kids to a Halloween party and Freya asked me why Cole doesn't like them and I asked what she meant. She said she asked why he likes other kids more than them and he told her they don't have the same mom. Theo didn't really understand most of it but Freya understood enough to be upset. She was crying and Theo was confused more than anything. This all came up because Freya wanted to show off her costume to Cole but he wasn't interested. Yet he does show interest in other kids' costumes.\n\nI told them sometimes, when a kid ends up with their parents no longer together and they fight a lot or when a kid loses their mommy or daddy young like Cole lost his mommy, it means they find it hard to let some people into their heart. That Cole lost his mommy and it made it harder for him to feel about us the way we feel about him. Freya said her best friend has a sister who has a different dad but she loves her. I told her it doesn't happen all of the time and sometimes it gets better but that how Cole feels does happen at times and all we can do is try to accept it and respect the way he feels. I also told them it was not their fault, at all.\n\nMy husband wasn't home at the time but when he did I told him what happened. His parents were also home because they wanted to see the kids all dressed up. They heard what I told my husband and they told me I should never have said that to the kids because I should know Cole isn't being fully honest when he says things about not loving them and I will make the kids think it's true when they're so little and too young to really understand the complexities and I made it so black and white for them.\n\nMy husband told his parents they needed to leave. But they called me a bad mom before they left.

I\u2019m pretty sure Cole appreciates that in a way he cannot really express yet. \n\nInlaws need to stay in their lane. Good on your husband for backing you up.", "NTA. Your ILs need to back off. Not sure what they wanted you to say to comfort your child in this complex situation. I think what you said was fine. It didn\u2019t lead to additional hurt feelings and your husband is backing you so forget the in-laws\u2019 opinions.", "You're NTA. Armchair parental critics are almist always the A-Hs. Your explanation was perfect and age appropriate. An honest answer beats the tap dancing, side stepping, smoke up the crack answer your in laws could have tried giving your kids.", "NTA - explaining the rough parts of life to little kids is hard. Sounds like you tried your best, and didn't trash Cole.", "NTA\n\nYou tried your best to explain the situation to a child and you did it WITHOUT being negative about the one who\u2019s being sooo negative. \n\nIs he still in therapy? If not, I suggest restarting, because he needs to learn a bit of humility where his siblings are concerned. I\u2019m not saying he needs to \u201clove\u201d them, but he certainly needs to stop giving off \u201chate\u201d vibes, cause they\u2019re not to blame for his loss.", "NTA You are doing your best in a tough spot. \n\nI feel like I read a post from Cole's perspectives not too long ago where he was disinterested in the family and the mom (not his mom, but the step-mom) was mad at him for not having more of an interest. I remember the comments suggesting family therapy. I wonder if Freya might ready for this to help her sort out her feelings.", "NTA.  I think you explained it in an age-appropriate way.  At this point, the younger kids may also benefit from therapy.", "NTA you are a good Mom. You respect Coles bounderies and don't pressure him which Most likely will destroy every Kind of relationship you have. \n\nIt is hard for the Kids but you should try Therapy for the Younger ones. They need help to understand that sometimes you can't force feelings even to close Family members", "NTA. Contrary to your in-laws unsolicited opinions, I think you are handling this spectacularly. You are respecting Cole's boundaries, meeting him where he's at and you explained to your kids how Cole feels in an age-appropriate way.", "NTA. You did a great job explaining things to your kids and your in-laws are dead wrong. Kids that age NEED more black and white than shades of grey and that's what you gave them. \n\nHave you considered therapy again? You mentioned that Cole had it before and that you had family therapy at one point but that was before you married 7 years ago. 16 is a tough age for anyone and it seems like Cole is feeling alienated from the rest of you. Might be worth giving it another go.", "NTA. I think that the way you addressed your daughters concerns was perfect. You managed to respect and acknowledge that Cole's feelings were valid and understandable while also giving your daughter age appropriate context so that she can understand it's not personal, more situational.\n\nYou also didn't deny her suspicions which is what many people would do in this situation. You gave her space to outline the issue and then addressed it in a way that avoided painting anybody as the bad guy, while still remaining honest. Good job!", "NTA, you explained the situation for what it is to your children. I think it's the best you could have done, although difficult, instead of feeding them some other answer that spares their feelings and keeps them hoping for something that might not happen in terms of bonding/affection from their half brother. I sincerely feel you were an amazing parent in this case don't listen to your in-laws.", "Your explanation was very clear, delicate, and respectful of Cole and your kids. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are the opposite of a bad mom. You are a great mom, and a great stepmother. You are raising your children to be respectful and understanding of Cole's feelings, and you are not bullying Cole into doing what he doesn't want to do. Trust me, he will appreciate it, and your children will grow up without false hope and a more compassionate understanding of blended families.\n\nAnd to be honest, your way is the only way Cole may ever come around. Your in-laws are way out of line. Don't give their ridiculous, damaging attitude another thought.", "Nta. I think you did a good job of explaining it. That said, I think it\u2019s time for some family therapy with Cole and his Dad. Maybe in there he should bring up what his sister said. This will get harder for all of them as they get older. Cole can love his mother and cherish her memories. He can also love his new family additions and realize these people are here for him but eventually won\u2019t be if this continues. He has two siblings that love him. They may eventually be his only family when he\u2019s old. He can grow that bond or destroy it.", "I think you explained it beautifully to your children. Your in-laws don\u2019t get a vote or a voice in how you explain Cole\u2019s behavior to his younger half-siblings. \n\nNTA", "NTA  Sounds like you handled things quite well and good for your husband to back you up.  Cole may never feel about his siblings the way others would prefer but that's neither right or wrong...it's just what it is.", "NTA You are doing an excellent job as a parent and stepparent. Being kind but real about a situation like this doesn\u2019t make things worse; living in denial sure can, though. You have a lot of wisdom and compassion. Calling you a bad mother over kindly helping your child understand a painful reality is deeply ironic.", "NTA. I really don\u2019t see how you could\u2019ve explained it any better than how you did. It\u2019s the truth and you broke it down so your younger kids could understand and you are very understanding to his situation as well.", "YTA.  6 years old is way too young to understand the intricacies of relationships and trauma. Teenagers can be aloof but are still developing, and now his little sister thinks he can't ever love her. That is a heavy load to place on both kids.\n\nEven if he truly dislikes his siblings, they are too young to bear the burden of that knowledge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s it sometimes it\u2019s hard it let people in your heart after trauma. It\u2019s nice you don\u2019t force him or guilt him in any way. Hopefully in the future they can reconnect as adults", "NTA. Wow, you actually sound like a good mom and an understanding stepmom.", "NTA. What you said is beautiful and correct. You\u2019re asking your children to show empathy and have space for another\u2019s emotions. Fuck your in laws. Unless they\u2019ve been where Cole is, they cannot understand. I\u2019ve been where Cole is and I guarantee what you\u2019re doing will prove to be the best thing you could have possibly done in due time. \n\nYou\u2019re a gem of a human and a fantastic parent. It\u2019s genuinely making my day you\u2019re holding so much empathy, kindness, and space for a child, especially one that isn\u2019t yours. Parents like you give me a lot of hope for the next generation. \n\nTherapy, specifically with Cole and his dad, should seriously be considered. In time, you may be able to be included. This can work wonders for your family. If you have an open mind, which you clearly do, you and your family can really benefit from therapy. Find a therapist Cole likes though. If he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable after like 4-5 meetings (he does have trust issues) fire the therapist and try again. Don\u2019t settle on the first doc that gets his file.", "NTA \n\nYou did your best. You never said anything negative.", "NTA\n\nWhat you said to your kids was the truth and you explained it in a kind gentle manner.  They are going to come across people that don\u2019t like them and/or are distant as they go through life.\n\nAlso, I also think it\u2019s fantastic that you understand where Cole is coming from and rather than forcing him to forge a bond between them, you are respecting his feelings.", "NTA. You explained it in an age appropriate way, did not blame Cole for his feelings and did not invalidate your daughters feelings either. You NAILED this.", "Nta", "NTA.  Good job being so honest and accepting of Cole's feelings.  Hopefully he will someday accept you and his half siblings more but at least you are doing as much as you can no matter what happens in the future.", "I agree. I think the OP did a good job at trying to explain a complex situation to young children. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, it\u2019s just the way things sometimes are. Pushing or getting angry helps no one. \n\nNTA", "The phrasing OP used of having a hard time letting people into their heart is just ~*chefs kiss*~\n\nYou did a wonderful thing for your younger kids; you started the conversation early in their lives, age-appropriately, and kindly. This will continue to foster a loving and respectful environment for all three of your kids, even with the tough feelings. Ya killing it!", "Absolutely, imagine Freya and Theo being fed fairy tales only to grow up and gradually gain a better understanding of dynamics and then realise mum fed them stories ... the betrayal on top of everything!", "OP is doing everything right, both as a mom and a stepmom.\n\nCole is not even trying to be nice to the little kids living in his own house. He hurt a little girl's feelings for no reason other than \"She's a reminder that my mom is dead\". He doesn't have to love his half-siblings, but a little politeness won't hurt. Yes, he's a teenager, and he's in pain, but therapy could help him be less angry at a couple of blameless kids.", "If they're old enough to notice the nuances of his behaviour, then they're old enough to be given an age appropriate explanation. Much like death, different relationships between adults, disabilities and other adult things can, and often need to be, explained to kids so there is no stigma or shame around anything. \n\nThe mum/stepmum explained it in a very age appropriate way. Start love and understanding young \n\nNta."]}
