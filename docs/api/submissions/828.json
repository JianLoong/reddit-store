I had to frame the safe word as something that would benefit him when he was overwhelmed, and that he could help me too if he could switch topics when I feel too tired to discuss certain things. \n\nWe also have safe topics where we can get each other laughing, or I ask him detailed \u2018trivia style\u2019 questions about one of his interests. That second tactic is something we learnt in family therapy that was useful as a distraction to stop a meltdown. My brother admitted as an autistic person he\u2019s always treated as stupid by others, and so he likes answering questions about his interests (same reason he loves to show his knowledge in debate), so asking him questions about something you don\u2019t know about fulfils that criteria whilst also moving away from negative topics or interactions. \n\nOf course all people on the spectrum are different, but if your experiences are anything like my families, I hope some of those tactics might help!", "NTA.\n\n\nI'm autistic too but I can't stand adversarial people.

Don't put his needs above your own", "I apologize", "I actually don't think it's you, specifically. I am not here to call your parents bad parents. It sounds like they're probably alright people who were working with the resources available when you were a child. The fact remains, they're the parents and they set up a home life in which one kid was called upon to give things up or accommodate the other more often than is good for either child. It also sounds like there was a focus on the kinds of programs that aim to make a young person appear and behave more like their neurotypical peers. \n\nWhen you talk about your brother in these posts you seem to take it for granted that you two could not possibly come to a mutual understanding of your own respective comfort levels and an agreed upon system for communicating them. That system would require both of you to step out of your comfort zones, not just you. \n\nThe other thing I notice is that there is an assumption that he will never love independently. Maybe he won't but that doesn't mean he can't lead an adult life with the expectation that he will be responsible for his own actions in relationships. It is absolutely not your job to diagnose or fix anyone's depression. It is possible that your brother is kind of depressed or feels trapped in his life. The second someone describes a family member as \"probably never going to live independently\" it's a red flag for me. I don't know if this is the case in your family, but autistic adults often get treated like teenagers far longer than they should. Like, what would happen if he decided to order a drink with lunch? Would that be fine with your family? \n\nI'm not assuming any malice here. It just feels like a lot of the ways you're describing your relationship fit well with a way of thinking about autistic people that doesn't assume competence and that treats poor relationships as inevitable \"because of the autism.\"", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, best of luck to you <3", "That sounds awful \ud83d\ude22 \n\nYou are definitely allowed to take space, even if (maybe especially if) you love someone four times a week with that kind of stress is much too much for somebody who is, themselves, unwell.

That seems like a good plan of action for your current state of mind and might get through to him.", "Literally not continuing a conversation point and ending the engagement when it happens is always an option. My toxic trait is that, if in a debate someone evades something I've said or tacitly ignores it, I just don't progress my argument until they do. It's assholish, but a useful way to force people to actually engage with what you say. It also weeds out this kind of behaviour because people who do what your brother is doing HATE to have to actually pull their head out of their ass.\n\nTry to see him less and recuperate, and be Really strict about this.

She stole, sabotaged my mother's anorexia treatment,  and lied the whole while and then lied about stupid arguments while aggressively trying to force you to agree. \n\nI told my sister to stop talking or stop lying and going after people because our mother had threatened guardianship before. My sister demonstrated not knowing right from wrong and everything about her supported it.\n\nLet me tell you something that I should've known before her six months of escalation, lying, and almost killing us multiple times trying to force contact.\n\nYour brother is not your responsibility. He is your parents responsibility. If he cannot function with others, then it is their problem. \n\nHe only hurts you and is unable to change. Repeating the same interactions with him over and over and expecting a different outcome is madness.\n\nJust drop the rope.", "Why don\u2019t you try to make a \u201csafe word\u201d with him? \nExplain that you are feeling like you can\u2019t deal with all these debates, and you want him in your life but it is getting to a point where it is harmful. \n\nTell him that once you say \u201cX\u201d then he has to stop talking about the topic and switch to something else. \n\nMaybe it will take time, but placing a hard boundary might really help in this situation.", "NTA just make sure you state why very bluntly and don\u2019t sugar coat it.

But have you taken in any content from actually Autistic adults so you could understand their communication needs better or was your little brother just thrown through ABA programs and therapies to get him to \u201cact normally\u201d? Is it possible that you\u2019re also expecting him to bridge this communication gap from his side because \u201che\u2019s autistic and we\u2019re all typical\u201d and so you\u2019re resentful that there\u2019s communication effort towards him but you can\u2019t see any of the communication effort being put in on his side since your brain doesn\u2019t work that way? \n\nIs it also possible that he thinks he isn\u2019t debating because he\u2019s taking the definition of debating very literally or he\u2019s asked you to tell him what a debate/argument is and is taking that very literally? Also, since your parents seemingly incorrectly parentized you into helping raise your little brother is it possible he thinks that when he doesn\u2019t understand every detail of a subject he can go to you to hash it out and him desperately trying to understand leads to him asking thousands of questions that seem like debating or nitpicking a topic? He might think of that as \u201ctrying to get it\u201d and not as debating since he doesn\u2019t actually feel he knows enough to have an opinion or position. Or if he does call it debating he might not be able to explain why he does it because everyone around him is too busy assuming or too confrontational?\n\nAll of those things could help you and your brother communicate better. Watching content by actually Autistic creators together to see what he clicks with and relates to would also help considerably. \n\nAt the same time you do need to get mental stability. You just want to make it clear that many things play into your mental health beyond just talking to him. He very likely will take it as very literal and will feel like a massive burden who doesn\u2019t deserve your time. It isn\u2019t like he hasn\u2019t noticed that no one else wants to be part of his life. So he needs to know there are outside factors impacting your mental health and that your mental health means you can\u2019t have the very detailed conversations he likes to have. He might be working on reducing that behavior but right now your mental health needs cared for or you\u2019d be a bad sibling if you had a mental breakdown and someone got hurt due to you not looking after your health. \n\nSource: I am just like this brother, well basically. My parents denied my diagnosis because I excelled academically but when I stumbled into topics I didn\u2019t get a full grasp of or couldn\u2019t wrap my head around I needed to hash them out. I had no one to do that with. My family also moved every couple years I never had a hope of making friends anyway. I did find a partner, online - but we have been in person 5 years, and have been married for 4 years now but I do still have accessibility needs. No one ever explained to me that my need to fully understand came across as dogmatic or overbearing, they just said confusing things like \u201cyou always want the last word\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re a know it all\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re just a walking encyclopedia and can never just be wrong\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re a negative burden\u201d, instead of asking me why I couldn\u2019t let a topic go. I had to figure out all on my own after I was rediagnosed at 29 (as I was never told I was Autistic and they trashed my records from age 4) while I was homeless due to my accessibility needs not being met which caused a complete breakdown. My parents didn\u2019t believe that anyone could remain at home after 18 and almost entirely cut contact unless they needed something as soon as high school was over so my situation was somewhat different. \n\nBut I\u2019d bet a lot of money that he\u2019s doing this because he doesn\u2019t fully understand the topics he\u2019s \u201cdebating\u201d or has been accidentally taught that he\u2019s too socially inept to form his own opinions on certain classes of things so is trying to figure out other peoples so that he can mirror them. People then call it debating and thus he might think he\u2019s debating when he\u2019s actually trying to understand and gain ability to mask/mirror because no one wants him as his authentic self (which he\u2019s likely very highly and acutely aware of but can\u2019t figure out how to pretend to be someone else well enough).", "NTA.

When someone is being a jerk we walk away. No bye no explanation. And we sat my boy down and told him why. Maybe you could do the same but with your brother not in protective mode.
