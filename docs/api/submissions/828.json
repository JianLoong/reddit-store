Or he could tell me his safe word when he was starting to feel stressed and overwhelmed, and we could change setting or activity before he had a meltdown. \n\nThe way you approach this is very key, as often being told to stop (like you would to a non-autistic person) can have a very detrimental effect, as some autistic people can struggle to handle negative feedback if they\u2019re less socially developed in that way. I had to frame the safe word as something that would benefit him when he was overwhelmed, and that he could help me too if he could switch topics when I feel too tired to discuss certain things. \n\nWe also have safe topics where we can get each other laughing, or I ask him detailed \u2018trivia style\u2019 questions about one of his interests. That second tactic is something we learnt in family therapy that was useful as a distraction to stop a meltdown. My brother admitted as an autistic person he\u2019s always treated as stupid by others, and so he likes answering questions about his interests (same reason he loves to show his knowledge in debate), so asking him questions about something you don\u2019t know about fulfils that criteria whilst also moving away from negative topics or interactions. \n\nOf course all people on the spectrum are different, but if your experiences are anything like my families, I hope some of those tactics might help!", "NTA.\n\n\nI'm autistic too but I can't stand adversarial people. They suck.", "NAH. It sounds like you two were put in a difficult situation. Do you know much about the double empathy problem? Basically, you two have a hard time understanding each other, which is a whole different thing from him not understanding \"the way things are.\" Often social skills programs can make things even more difficult because they're built around trying to change the autistic person and they teach \"social skills\" in a way that doesn't translate to real life interactions where people meet as equals. \n\nWanting time to pull back from a relationship for some personal space doesn't make you an asshole.

I have a hard \"no politics\" stance with them because I will not debate someone who refutes everything I say with \"you can't trust the Internet.\" I also teach college writing courses which include how to find reputable sources for a living, so this accusation is especially irritating.\n\nThey are extremely stubborn and continue brining politics up.

But you might also consider how clearly and consistently you're communicating your needs. If your brother can't grasp the nuance of when it is appropriate to debate something, would he understand a \"no debates\" policy?

I think you've either got to be an asshole or an only child to think this is practical advice. Which one are you? Only child, or asshole?", "Try limiting your engagement with him, and when he starts to get combative when you do see him, say \"I've communicated my problem with this dynamic to you before, and if my boundaries are not respected, I'm going to have to prioritise my own well-being and leave early today\". Don't make it a point for discussion. Any and all argument can be met with \"that just won't work for me\".\n\nThing is, people with autism aren't less able to learn these things, not really.

Of course he might not be doing it intentionally, but he can certainly learn to identify it.

But he's learned that I've identified it myself and will absolutely call him out for it.", "NTA. You can't live your life for him. You may move to other side of the world one day.

If that\u2019s the case, letting things continue like this isn\u2019t doing him any favors. He needs a solid kick in the pants to change his behavior, although if your parents are enabling his behavior, it might be hard for that kick to actually land.", "You are not the reason it will get worse. The reason is that he has a very small group of people that support him because of his autism. That's not your fault. You are not responsible for his depression and you won't be the one making it worse. Circumstances are just bad for your brother. And not taking care of yourself isn't going to help him either. So please take care of you first! All the best.", "No, you stepping away will give him a choice: listen to what you tell him, and remember it, and act on it, and get to spend time with you, or don't listen, don't remember, and/or don't act on what you tell him, and don't get to spend time with you.\n\nI see that you've told him how you feel, etc. I may have missed it (if so, I'm sorry), but have you said, in effect, 'I've told you X, but you keep doing Y. If you're going to keep doing Y, I'm not going to be able to spend time with you. If you want me to spend time with you, then you *have to* stop doing Y\"?", "You deserve to be mentally well too. Don't put his needs above your own", "I apologize", "I actually don't think it's you, specifically. I am not here to call your parents bad parents. It sounds like they're probably alright people who were working with the resources available when you were a child. The fact remains, they're the parents and they set up a home life in which one kid was called upon to give things up or accommodate the other more often than is good for either child. It also sounds like there was a focus on the kinds of programs that aim to make a young person appear and behave more like their neurotypical peers. \n\nWhen you talk about your brother in these posts you seem to take it for granted that you two could not possibly come to a mutual understanding of your own respective comfort levels and an agreed upon system for communicating them. That system would require both of you to step out of your comfort zones, not just you. \n\nThe other thing I notice is that there is an assumption that he will never love independently. Maybe he won't but that doesn't mean he can't lead an adult life with the expectation that he will be responsible for his own actions in relationships. It is absolutely not your job to diagnose or fix anyone's depression. It is possible that your brother is kind of depressed or feels trapped in his life. The second someone describes a family member as \"probably never going to live independently\" it's a red flag for me. I don't know if this is the case in your family, but autistic adults often get treated like teenagers far longer than they should. Like, what would happen if he decided to order a drink with lunch? Would that be fine with your family? \n\nI'm not assuming any malice here. It just feels like a lot of the ways you're describing your relationship fit well with a way of thinking about autistic people that doesn't assume competence and that treats poor relationships as inevitable \"because of the autism.\"", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, best of luck to you <3", "That sounds awful \ud83d\ude22 \n\nYou are definitely allowed to take space, even if (maybe especially if) you love someone four times a week with that kind of stress is much too much for somebody who is, themselves, unwell.

I don\u2019t see anyone except my husband anywhere near that much.\n\nAs an aside, have you asked him what he thinks you should do about it?\n\n(I\u2019ve already given my judgement as N T A in a previous comment by the way)", "Maybe you can find a valunteer? Were i live you have them. I have one. Someone who spends time with him on a regular basis. Once in a few weeks? Or more. \nSomeone who he can have discussions with.

But it has never brought about any sort of long term permanent change. I've been living with this dynamic for most of my life. I'm just at a point where I am unwell and don't feel like I can handle what I usually handle, and don't know what to do", "Could you share an example of how you call that out?", "If you\u2019ve used this tool before, and it\u2019s no longer effective, then it definitely seems like it\u2019s time to set higher consequences. Other posters have suggested limiting contact, but clearly explaining why you\u2019re doing it. That seems like a good plan of action for your current state of mind and might get through to him.", "Literally not continuing a conversation point and ending the engagement when it happens is always an option. My toxic trait is that, if in a debate someone evades something I've said or tacitly ignores it, I just don't progress my argument until they do. It's assholish, but a useful way to force people to actually engage with what you say. It also weeds out this kind of behaviour because people who do what your brother is doing HATE to have to actually pull their head out of their ass.\n\nTry to see him less and recuperate, and be Really strict about this. Try not to put it callously or coldly if he can read that kind of nuance, but do make it clear that this isn't negotiable and must be acknowledged on a permanent basis. He will learn once he realises he has to if he wants a good relationship with you."]}
