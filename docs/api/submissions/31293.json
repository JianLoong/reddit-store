You're a 34yo woman and the expectation of privacy in your room is pretty reasonable. A 6yo child, especially one that isn't yours, shouldn't have free access to enter your room as he pleases.\n\nI don't know if there will be a cultural barrier here or if you'll offend the mother/family by asking, but I doubt it. You're still not the asshole in that case", "I certainly don't think you're the asshole for wanting privacy, nor would you be the asshole for asking. But I get why you're nervous. I'm not a confrontation person in the first place, and being in Japan kind of makes that part of my personality even more active (maybe you can relate lol). Personally, I would just lock my Switch in my luggage, but I don't know if that's the \"healthy\" way to go about it lol.\n\nHow similar are you and the mother's ages? If she's your age (or even younger), then I feel it'd probably go better. But really, you know her more than I do. Think about the topics you've talked about, how she reacts to certain subjects, etc. You'll have a better idea of her mindset then, and therefore how'd she'd react.", "So let's be honest, the son is going to try to use your Switch or even steal it, which is why he wants to know where it is.\n\nTell your mom about this and him wanting to know where the Switch is.\n\nYWNBTA", "NTA. You *ABSOLUTELY* should be able to have privacy in your room. Forgetting the Switch for a moment - you could be changing clothes, or otherwise not prepared for a guest in your room!  \n\nDefinitely speak to her. Her son needs to learn boundaries, and you and she can be a united front on that subject.  She might also allow you to put a lock on the door; I would definitely want one, were I in your place. \n\nAs a side note, he also needs to learn not to mock anyone learning a language.", "YWNBTA, but if it still worries you to talk to mum, you could always buy a doorstop to prevent the door from actually opening.", "Nta.\n\nReally the host should have had a key lock on the door", "Nta doesnt sound rude at all. It\u2019s important for kids to learn boundaries.", "If she won\u2019t let her son play video games often, I don\u2019t see why she would be mad at you because he wants to come in and take or play the switch. She should reasonably respect your privacy and the fact that he\u2019s mocking your Japanese.

I think the mum will appreciate you talking to her instead of trying to wrangle her son herself!", "NTA. It's reasonable to expect privacy and security of your things. Its important that you communicate about this. I grew up as a host family so I really do mean this. Please don't forget that an exchange like this is exactly that: an *exchange* of experiences, knowledge and culture. As a host family, this is an opportunity for them to stretch their own awareness a little and learn a bit about the privacy and personal space expectations of your culture. So really, bringing this up is a function of why you're there in the first place!\n\nIf you're worried about causing offense or things getting lost in translation, you could speak to your exchange coordinator instead.

You don't have a problem with him existing in the house, just with him in your designated private room. And it sounds like the mom will have a problem too.", "You can buy temporary locks on Amazon that don't require any nails, drilling, or even risk damaging the paint. There's one you put in the hole where the door latches shut, and it has a small chain a metal piece that, when in place, prevents the door from being opened. Down side, you can only use it when you're in the room. Other than that, I'd try to make sure your switch stays locked up constantly. If it's not in your hand, lock it up. But also mention this incident to your host either way. NTA", "NTA\n\nI am a host mom for high school kids in the United States - although for high school age kids. You should absolutely communicate with the host mom immediately. DO NOT WAIT until he breaks your Switch or the situation escalates in any way. Right now this is not a big deal. Once something happens it will then be A Big Deal.", "NTA. This is not even about you complaining to her about her abilities as a mother or host mom, you are letting her know that her 6yo is trying to circumvent her house rules in a way that would be problematic for you as well as him breaking her rules", "NTA, but with potential faux pas. As someone who has lived in Japan multiple times, both as homestay and not, one thing to keep in mind is that the concept of \u201cit takes a village to raise a child\u201d is much stronger there than in the USA, where I assume you are probably from. It\u2019s normal, and even expected, for you to correct (gently) the behavior of a young child who is misbehaving. As they get older the expectation shifts more toward just ignoring them, but when they are young like your host sibling it is totally normal for you to sit down with your host brother and discourage this behavior. I think discussing with your host mom would be a good step forward to ensure you\u2019re not stepping on her toes, but remember that this could easily come across as a reflection of her parenting, and you may only get a peace-keeping response. \n\nNext time he starts asking about your switch, try telling him something like one of the below (romaji and translation included since idk your proficiency level)\n\n\u201c \u4eca\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3067\u904a\u3076\u306a\u3093\u3066\u30c0\u30e1\u3060\u3088\u3002\u6c34\u301c\u91d1\u3060\u3051\u3067\u30de\u30de\u304c\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3058\u306a\u3044\uff1f\"\n\nRomaji: ima suicchi de asobu nante dame da yo.

A 6 year old is old enough to understand certain rooms are off limits and your host mom needs to know what he\u2019s doing. As for your switch, you shouldn\u2019t have to lock it away because again, at 6 he should have an understanding that certain things are off limits as well, like other people\u2019s personal belongings. But again, let your host mom know he has been asking about it. You can also ask if you can get a lock for your door. There are ones that fit in to the door and can lock from one side, you see them on TikTok all the time. And can be purchased off Amazon for a decent price.", "Nta. Talk to her about adding a lock.", "NTA. Just tell her, her son keeps coming into your room asking about the Switch wanting to play it.

Let her know what's happening.  \"So you know, your son saw I had a Switch and has been coming into my room to try and find it.

Addicts will do almost anything to fulfill their addiction, including intruding on your personal space, and especially if they lack the restraint, like a 6-year-old would.\n\nTalk to the mom and lock up your Switch. Or, at least, put it on a very high shelf. If he gets his hands on it and breaks it, that would suck for all involved.", "Talk to the host mom.

He's invading your privacy but 6 is too young to get how inappropriate that is. The switch is an attractive nuisance for a little kid so the best thing is, get it out of his sight and make it so he can't find and access it. And maybe get some kind of lock for the room.", "NTA, and you need to take extra care of your Switch. He\u2019s going to go in there snooping for it even if you say something to his mom.

If she cares, see what she thinks is the best way to deal with her child.", "This. Also yes locking it up when not in use is a good extra step to take. \n\nNTA. You should have your privacy.", "I don't agree. I spent two years living with different families, and I don't think I should have been able to lock them out of a room in their own home. They, of course, were respectful of my privacy and didn't enter my room without my knowledge/permission, as OP's host mom and host sister appear to be. A lock shouldn't be necessary. Obviously, the language barrier makes things difficult, so OP might want to enlist the help of someone who can interpret, but a polite conversation with the host mom, explaining that the host brother is barging in, really ought to be enough.", "This is perfect.\n\nI spent two years living with different host families in Russia.
