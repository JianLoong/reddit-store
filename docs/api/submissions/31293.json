You're a 34yo woman and the expectation of privacy in your room is pretty reasonable. A 6yo child, especially one that isn't yours, shouldn't have free access to enter your room as he pleases.\n\nI don't know if there will be a cultural barrier here or if you'll offend the mother/family by asking, but I doubt it. You're still not the asshole in that case", "I certainly don't think you're the asshole for wanting privacy, nor would you be the asshole for asking. But I get why you're nervous. I'm not a confrontation person in the first place, and being in Japan kind of makes that part of my personality even more active (maybe you can relate lol). Personally, I would just lock my Switch in my luggage, but I don't know if that's the \"healthy\" way to go about it lol.\n\nHow similar are you and the mother's ages? If she's your age (or even younger), then I feel it'd probably go better. But really, you know her more than I do. Think about the topics you've talked about, how she reacts to certain subjects, etc. You'll have a better idea of her mindset then, and therefore how'd she'd react.", "So let's be honest, the son is going to try to use your Switch or even steal it, which is why he wants to know where it is.\n\nTell your mom about this and him wanting to know where the Switch is.\n\nYWNBTA", "NTA. You *ABSOLUTELY* should be able to have privacy in your room. Forgetting the Switch for a moment - you could be changing clothes, or otherwise not prepared for a guest in your room!  \n\nDefinitely speak to her. Her son needs to learn boundaries, and you and she can be a united front on that subject.  She might also allow you to put a lock on the door; I would definitely want one, were I in your place. \n\nAs a side note, he also needs to learn not to mock anyone learning a language.", "YWNBTA, but if it still worries you to talk to mum, you could always buy a doorstop to prevent the door from actually opening.", "Nta.\n\nReally the host should have had a key lock on the door", "Nta doesnt sound rude at all. It\u2019s important for kids to learn boundaries.", "If she won\u2019t let her son play video games often, I don\u2019t see why she would be mad at you because he wants to come in and take or play the switch. She should reasonably respect your privacy and the fact that he\u2019s mocking your Japanese. I\u2019d be pretty pissed if my kid were to mock a language barrier, and definitely teach him not to go where he\u2019s not invited. NTA", "NTA. I think the mum will appreciate you talking to her instead of trying to wrangle her son herself!", "NTA. It's reasonable to expect privacy and security of your things. Its important that you communicate about this. I grew up as a host family so I really do mean this. Please don't forget that an exchange like this is exactly that: an *exchange* of experiences, knowledge and culture. As a host family, this is an opportunity for them to stretch their own awareness a little and learn a bit about the privacy and personal space expectations of your culture. So really, bringing this up is a function of why you're there in the first place!\n\nIf you're worried about causing offense or things getting lost in translation, you could speak to your exchange coordinator instead. They'll be in a good position to either speak to the host on your behalf or help mediate a discussion. The program wants all 3 of you to enjoy your stay!", "He only opened your door one time without knocking, and you were there and he did nothing wrong. It sounds like you may be creating an issue when there is none.

You don't have a problem with him existing in the house, just with him in your designated private room. And it sounds like the mom will have a problem too.", "You can buy temporary locks on Amazon that don't require any nails, drilling, or even risk damaging the paint. There's one you put in the hole where the door latches shut, and it has a small chain a metal piece that, when in place, prevents the door from being opened. Down side, you can only use it when you're in the room. Other than that, I'd try to make sure your switch stays locked up constantly. If it's not in your hand, lock it up. But also mention this incident to your host either way. NTA"]}
