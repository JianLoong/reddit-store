You're a 34yo woman and the expectation of privacy in your room is pretty reasonable.

I'm not a confrontation person in the first place, and being in Japan kind of makes that part of my personality even more active (maybe you can relate lol). Personally, I would just lock my Switch in my luggage, but I don't know if that's the \"healthy\" way to go about it lol.\n\nHow similar are you and the mother's ages? If she's your age (or even younger), then I feel it'd probably go better. But really, you know her more than I do.

Its important that you communicate about this. I grew up as a host family so I really do mean this. Please don't forget that an exchange like this is exactly that: an *exchange* of experiences, knowledge and culture. As a host family, this is an opportunity for them to stretch their own awareness a little and learn a bit about the privacy and personal space expectations of your culture.

There's one you put in the hole where the door latches shut, and it has a small chain a metal piece that, when in place, prevents the door from being opened. Down side, you can only use it when you're in the room. Other than that, I'd try to make sure your switch stays locked up constantly. If it's not in your hand, lock it up. But also mention this incident to your host either way. NTA", "NTA\n\nI am a host mom for high school kids in the United States - although for high school age kids. You should absolutely communicate with the host mom immediately. DO NOT WAIT until he breaks your Switch or the situation escalates in any way. Right now this is not a big deal. Once something happens it will then be A Big Deal.", "NTA. This is not even about you complaining to her about her abilities as a mother or host mom, you are letting her know that her 6yo is trying to circumvent her house rules in a way that would be problematic for you as well as him breaking her rules", "NTA, but with potential faux pas. As someone who has lived in Japan multiple times, both as homestay and not, one thing to keep in mind is that the concept of \u201cit takes a village to raise a child\u201d is much stronger there than in the USA, where I assume you are probably from. It\u2019s normal, and even expected, for you to correct (gently) the behavior of a young child who is misbehaving. As they get older the expectation shifts more toward just ignoring them, but when they are young like your host sibling it is totally normal for you to sit down with your host brother and discourage this behavior. I think discussing with your host mom would be a good step forward to ensure you\u2019re not stepping on her toes, but remember that this could easily come across as a reflection of her parenting, and you may only get a peace-keeping response. \n\nNext time he starts asking about your switch, try telling him something like one of the below (romaji and translation included since idk your proficiency level)\n\n\u201c \u4eca\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3067\u904a\u3076\u306a\u3093\u3066\u30c0\u30e1\u3060\u3088\u3002\u6c34\u301c\u91d1\u3060\u3051\u3067\u30de\u30de\u304c\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3058\u306a\u3044\uff1f\"\n\nRomaji: ima suicchi de asobu nante dame da yo.

A 6 year old is old enough to understand certain rooms are off limits and your host mom needs to know what he\u2019s doing. As for your switch, you shouldn\u2019t have to lock it away because again, at 6 he should have an understanding that certain things are off limits as well, like other people\u2019s personal belongings.

He's invading your privacy but 6 is too young to get how inappropriate that is.

And even if it does have a knob, the ones with locks are usually bigger because the lock is above the handle, so it would require drilling a bigger hole in the door.
