The worker went to show something to another worker so there was only Maria and me standing in line. After few seconds another woman, Sarah, stood behind me with a full cart. After Sarah came a pregnant woman with a small child. Her cart was also full of things. Sarah let the pregnant woman stand in front of her, and I didn't want to let her in front of me because I only had three things and just enough money to pay quickly. Sarah started yelling that I should let the pregnant woman in go in front of me  and at that moment Maria turned around and she started also yelling that I should let the pregnant woman go in front of me. Maria did not want the pregnant woman to stand in front of her, but said that I should let her stand in front of me. Pregnant woman was also little bit annoyed but she wasnt saying anything. I told them that I understand that she is pregnant and has a small child, but I will finish soon as I have a few things. She would wait anyway for Maria to finish, so I didnt see why she wanted to go in front of me. At the end, the worker came and saw that they were yelling at me, and then she got angry that I wouldn't let the pregnant woman, so she told the pregnant woman to stand in front of Maria. Maria was angry. So in the end we all had to wait. All three grumbled about me afterwards.

You had 3 things. Like she can wait 1 minute. 2. The person in front of you wouldn\u2019t let her go in front 3. If people are yelling at me, then I\u2019m going to stand tall & not give in.

It\u2019s insane how pregnant women expect special treatment everywhere. I didn\u2019t and I was high risk. The store is the AH that didn\u2019t have an express lane.", "NTA, she's pregnant not disabled,she can wait in line like everyone else", "NTA. Why were all of them acting up so much - full blown yelling and all? Super weird. Being pregnant is not an excuse big enough for someone to become a stranger's priority.", "Also generally against company policy (in the US, anyway). \n\nIn the US, unless the employee was actually the owner, they really have no business bossing customers around like that, much less dictating line order. Line order is first-come first-serve and that's all there is to it. Employees don't get to prioritize one customer over others arbitrarily, and they certainly don't get to punish other customers for not giving into peer pressure. \n\nThis was some immature schoolyard BS. Pregnant lady could and should have waited in line just like everybody else. Being pregnant is hard, of course, but it's not a disability and she isn't automatically owed preferential treatment from everyone around her. If the employee really felt for her than they easily could've just called for a second cashier to make the line move quicker.", "Also, if it was going that slowly, sounds like they had a staff issue going on cause it seems like a register issue. An express lane for few items is common at most places, so gotta wonder how small a store this is tho.\n\nHonestly, leave a bad review and shop elsewhere if you have options. It just sounds like an exhausting place. Though, in general, many people would offer to let the person with a couple items go ahead of them, if we're talking about politeness, so the reaction makes zero sense", "I would have left. Got my 3 items at another store. But also is why I like self checkout.", "Ive been pregnant twice and went grocery shopping with a toddler while pregnant. I would never go in front of someone who only has THREE items when I have a full cart. It\u2019s inconsiderate of their time.

There was one time I offered to let someone before me because they had only two items.", "Where do live that that's the case?\nGenerally,  that's true for things such as dedicated seating on public transport , and is courteous even for non- dedicated seating, but it doesn't normally apply to things like queues in shops.", "I agree, I'm currently very pregnant and have a toddler, I would never ask either.  I'm just saying if someone very pregnant with a toddler asked me, I would absolutely let them.", "Not the commenter but in Portugal there is priority for:\n\n-Handicapped\n\n-Elderly\n\n-Pregnant women\n\n-People with a carried child (like a baby on your arms)", "I live in Argentina", "NTA if anything hing Maria would have been kind and let you go ahead of her with your 3 items.", "NTA\n\nI hate entitled people. And report the employee for the treatment towards you.", "NTA. As someone who has been pregnant, she can wait. It was nice the other person let her go ahead, but it was totally uncalled for to yell at you and try to pressure you to do the same.", "NTA. The part where Maria had to wait made me chuckle!", "NTA, I'm disabled and I can wait, and if I can't wait it's usually so obvious that people would let me by without having to ask in the first place.  \n\n\nI'm gonna get flack for this but a lot of pregnant women I've met are just super entitled because they think pregnancy is a get out of consequence free card. Had a pregnant woman steal a disable access seat from me once when I lived in South Carolina (I have a bad leg and seizures). She was upset when I proceeded 'accidentally' knock her purse to her feet with my cane.  \n\n\nOn the upside a very nice middle aged man let me take his seat.", "NTA. News flash, being pregnant doesn\u2019t give you an automatic excuse to be first in line for anything. You only had 3 things, it wouldn\u2019t have taken long. The store shouldn\u2019t have reacted the way it should\u2019ve. File a complaint against the worker. \n\nI never understood those people who think because your pregnant, you automatically get excuses for everything, like being first in line at a grocery store, for being an asshole because of the \u201chormones \u201c.  Like no. You still are able to process thoughts and are self aware.", "NTA I\u2019ve been pregnant three times and been shopping with small kids while pregnant. Didn\u2019t need to cut in line. Can wait like everyone else", "NTA. It wasn't until reddit that I discovered all the things I should have been entitled too since I spawned a few humans. I mean, wow! The nerve! I worked through my last pregnancy with nausea so bad I had a zolfran pump and I never once got to cut in lines. I totally missed out!", "As someone who has been the pregnant woman, the woman with a small child, and the woman who is pregnant with a small child, NTA. \n\nI always have a full cart, and very frequently am in long lines at the store. I have never asked to cut ahead, and frequently make others cut ahead of me. I\u2019m not sure what any of those people were thinking, but they were all wrong.", "NTA being pregnant and having a small kid doesn\u2019t give you special privileges", "NTA - You didn't get her pregnant!  Unless she lives in a hate state, it was her decision to stay pregnant.  You shouldn't have to give up your space for her.  \n\n\nAnd everyone was wrong to badger you for it.", "NTA. It never ceases to amaze me how pretentious people can be. \nI'm super pregnant but totally capable of waiting in line for my turn. I can't imagine asking someone to let me go ahead of them for this!", "NTA", "NTA. Am pregnant and would be mortified to have this kind of fuss made over me. If I'm unable to stand in a queue for 5 minutes I shouldn't be going grocery shopping.", "Nta they were just rude and entitled", "NTA, so the woman is  pregnant what's the big deal? She is not disabled and NOT special.  The cashier was out of line, she had absolutely no right to let the pregnant woman go first. OP really should have complained to the manager about the cashiers actions!!!", "NTA. Please consider about contacting the corporate office about this.   \n\n\nOnce I was standing behind a pregnant woman with only two ingredients. She saw me and told me to go ahead of her because she didn't want me to wait too long for her. I asked her if she was sure, she said yes. The cashier tried to stop her, but she said, \"Listen, this woman only has two things, she can go quickly so she doesn't wait for me to unload and then load my groceries. Look at this, I have more than 15 things. Let her go first, she easily can grab her things and go out once she paid.\" The cashier was quiet afterwards. Did not talk with both of us while she scanned the things. That gives me a reason to make sure I can help fellow customers in need.", "NTA\n\nI legit had to stand in line with a huge pregnant belly and my young toddler in line.

When I was pregnant I was grocery shopping the weekend before my due date. I was huge enough the lady tending the self checkout asked if I was gonna make it to my due date.

Someone who only has three items doesn't make much of a difference unless you have a really slow cashier.", "The pregnant woman went to the front of the line.  She should get some of the blame.", "Notice how it was not the pregnant woman yelling? And it was the cashier that made her go first?", "Honestly, leaning on the cart in a certain way was the only relief I got from my sciatica, just let me chill exactly where I am, because it's gonna hurt again as soon as I have to move.", "I do the exact same thing.", "Bur the cashier was ultimately the blame.", "NTA. Also, fuck the cashier. She\u2019s not line captain.", "For real. I had to sit to cook dinner and sitting on the toilet was killer for some reason.
