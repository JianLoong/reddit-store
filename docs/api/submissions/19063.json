Maria did not want the pregnant woman to stand in front of her, but said that I should let her stand in front of me. Pregnant woman was also little bit annoyed but she wasnt saying anything.

Employees don't get to prioritize one customer over others arbitrarily, and they certainly don't get to punish other customers for not giving into peer pressure. \n\nThis was some immature schoolyard BS. Pregnant lady could and should have waited in line just like everybody else.

I will offer to let someone directly behind me with only a few things go before me when I have a lot of items, but I don't see any logic in the reverse, regardless of whether or not they happen to be pregnant. \n\nAlso, I only do so if we're the only people in line, because I know others are just too likely to cause a scene of some sort.", "I know! There are people out there who don't show kindness.", "Yes to your entire comment. I wanted to live at the grocery store because the carts were my only form of relief. I tried some moves on a yoga ball it did nothing.", "As a cashier....you kinda are. She was wrong in this instnce though.", "Nta. The entitlement is amazing. But also the people saying the pregnant lady bears no blame are wrong imo. She had a small child with her. She is a parent- it is her job to teach her child how to behave like not an arsehole, fairly and with consideration for others. This makes her an extra arsehole.", "NTA. Pregnant or not, there\u2019s only one reason I would let someone ahead of me. If they had one or two items and the other lines and self checkout are full.", "I have three children.  I've been a pregnant lady in line three times.  I've been the pregnant lady with small children two times.  I have never once expected special treatment or people to give me their place in line.  I understand that every body is different and every pregnancy is different and she may have had stresses on her that I don't know about, but just because she's pregnant and has a child doesn't mean she deserves to cut the line.  And it doesn't mean that other people should berate you for not giving up your space.\n\nNTA", "NTA! Being pregnant isn\u2019t a disability. I worked on my feet all day up until 8 months gestation. If she\u2019s made it round the grocery store in one piece she can wait another 10 mins or so.", "NTA. And Maria is particularly ridiculous for yelling at you about it when she didnt want to let the pregnant woman go before her either.", "NTA. in thousands of years of human evolution we've settled on queueing up as the fairest way for multiple people to use/do the same thing.\n\nI don't care if they're old, pregnant, disabled (I'm disabled myself and wouldn't expect to be allowed to jump a queue) or whatever else. \n\nIf I feel to let someone go first that's cool but I won't be pressured into it.", "NTA. Maria and pregnant lady are the AHs here. If Maria felt so strongly, she would have let the lady in front of her. You only had a few items. If pregnant lady is fine to walk around a shop with a kid and fill up her cart, she\u2019s fine to wait an extra minute in a line for you to pay for your three items", "ESH. Sarah already let PW skipped so she shouldnt be yelling at you. Maria is just straight-up inconsiderate because she wants the PW to check out asap just not before her. cashier shouldnt be yelling at you either to let PW go first. PW shouldve said something if she didnt mind not going before you (unless shes a super socially anxious person). \n\ni think if you werent in a rush and only had so little there shouldve been a little more consideration esp if she had a kid with her with no one else to help a full cart. its not a big deal to let PW go before you.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s the reason why my country made a law that all stores have to had a separate line for pregnant women, old people and others that need it.", "Having been pregnant with SPD (hip issue, standing and walking was fucking awful), it still doesn't make sense to let someone with a cart full in front of someone with 3 items. \n\nIf it had been the reverse, and you had a full cart and a pregnant/disabled/elderly/whatever person who was having issues standing only had 3 items, I think it's best to let them go. But I still wouldn't call you an asshole necessarily if you didn't.", "NTA", "NTA. Lines exist for a sound reason.", "What country is this?\n\nIn the US, you are NTA.", "First, I don't think reddit can be blamed for the dislike of pregnant women as it is just a host to many people's opinions. Next, you ANTA the two women yelling at you and the cashier are in the wrong shame on the the women in line for yelling in front of a child and hi very capable mother should have put a stop to it by politely saying please don't raise you voice in front of my childit would have defused the situation and finally the pregnant woman wasn't acting  entitled she was just accepting what would have been a nice jester until it wasn't.", "NTA but that cashier kinda is, my store has the rule of no one skips line unless another register opens up like at my store when there's an extra big order (like today a $80 exchange for other products because she paid in cash and a $40 return because she paid for that bit by card, my manger hopped on to help her just to keep the lines moving when on a slow day i could have handled it myself)\n\nThe most I've help customers is a pregnant lady who looked really pale, i stole a chair out of the office so she could sit while she waited but she still had to wait like everyone else. It's not the only time I've stole the chair for customers but it's normally done for older customers who don't look the wellist", "NTA.", "Where do u people live?

A Redditor with brains. God Bless the self-checkout!", "Preggers wasn\u2019t saying anything because she knew that Sarah and Maria were doing all the bitching for her. No need for preggers to get her skivvies in a twist because everyone else was gonna sort it out for her. And they did. \n\nNTA!", "She got the blame BECAUSE she didn\u2019t speak up. She WANTED to cut the line, so just waited for others to fight for her. \nIf she genuinely didn\u2019t care she would try to diffuse the situation. For god\u2019s sake op had only 3 things! I get it\u2019s nice to let the pregnant woman cut the line but in this situation, she shouldn\u2019t wait.", "Made me think of [this scene](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mVKZRar-21s)\n\nFrom 1 minute in.", "she's pregnant and probably doesn't want to get them yelling at her if she tries to defend OP. It's a lot of stress, honestly, I would just stay quiet and if someone gave me a quick out like that employee then I would take it and run", "These were a bunch of aggressive and angry people yelling, we don\u2019t know pregnant lady, she might have been so anxious and stressed that she would have quacked like a duck if they demanded she do so.", "Exactly!  Preggers should have said something like, \u201cshe only has three things!  Maria, let her go in front of you.  I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nStupid Maria.

This is so bizarre.", "NTA... if you had a cart full of stuff and she had 2 or 3 three things, you'd be a tiny asshole. But in this situation.. no. I've birthed 4 chuldren, btw. And I never expected anyone else to inconvenience themselves for me... well, except for bathroom lines.", "NTA. You had 3 items, they ALL should have let you go 1st. Those people suck, sorry you had to deal with them.", "As a pregnant woman, with children, rn\u2026 I would never expect anyone to let me cut them in line with a full cart of groceries. If anything, I would\u2019ve let the person behind me with 3 items cut in front of me!", "Complain to the manager of the grocery store about the cashier.

What an awkward, crazy, and unnecessary scene. This type of bogus courtesy of deciding  who to allow to skip the line can be oppressive if one chooses -- with every right to do so -- not to play along. You had waited for your turn in line; that's all you were required to do. It didn't matter if you had one item or 51 items. Every time we go to a grocery store and do not use the self-check out, we take it for granted there may be a line. Sorry you had to be caught in this mess, but you did nothing wrong.", "NTA.
