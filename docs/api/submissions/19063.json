The worker went to show something to another worker so there was only Maria and me standing in line. After few seconds another woman, Sarah, stood behind me with a full cart. After Sarah came a pregnant woman with a small child. Her cart was also full of things. Sarah let the pregnant woman stand in front of her, and I didn't want to let her in front of me because I only had three things and just enough money to pay quickly. Sarah started yelling that I should let the pregnant woman in go in front of me  and at that moment Maria turned around and she started also yelling that I should let the pregnant woman go in front of me. Maria did not want the pregnant woman to stand in front of her, but said that I should let her stand in front of me. Pregnant woman was also little bit annoyed but she wasnt saying anything. I told them that I understand that she is pregnant and has a small child, but I will finish soon as I have a few things. She would wait anyway for Maria to finish, so I didnt see why she wanted to go in front of me. At the end, the worker came and saw that they were yelling at me, and then she got angry that I wouldn't let the pregnant woman, so she told the pregnant woman to stand in front of Maria. Maria was angry. So in the end we all had to wait. All three grumbled about me afterwards.

Kind of shocked at the reaction that everyone had towards you. I\u2019d also consider making a complaint against the store worker that showed aggravation towards you too.

Why should someone have to wait for others when they will take x amount of time longer. Why must we be compelled to do something  because someone else did.

I would have just told them all to can it and deal with the order the line was currently in. \n\nThis honestly feels a bit like when someone shaves their hair in solidarity with someone who has cancer and then turns around and expects everyone to follow suit. So instead of it just being about support it becomes a virtue signal. Honestly the other two women in line come across as very virtue signal focused.

You first since you have 3 items, the pregnant woman next since well the others offered nicely or not, the rest in the order of appearance.

You had 3 things. Like she can wait 1 minute. 2. The person in front of you wouldn\u2019t let her go in front 3. If people are yelling at me, then I\u2019m going to stand tall & not give in.

Having said that, it also would have been a courteous thing to do. \n\nThe amount of people saying \"not your fault she's knocked up\" is depressing, and these people clearly have never been pregnant.

Same reason you get up on a bus for an older person who's going to have a much rougher ride than you would standing.", "Pregnant women and people with limited mobility always have priority.\n\n In this case the cashier should have asked the pregnant woman to go to the check out right away.

It\u2019s insane how pregnant women expect special treatment everywhere. I didn\u2019t and I was high risk. The store is the AH that didn\u2019t have an express lane.", "NTA, she's pregnant not disabled,she can wait in line like everyone else", "NTA. Why were all of them acting up so much - full blown yelling and all? Super weird. Being pregnant is not an excuse big enough for someone to become a stranger's priority.", "Also generally against company policy (in the US, anyway). \n\nIn the US, unless the employee was actually the owner, they really have no business bossing customers around like that, much less dictating line order. Line order is first-come first-serve and that's all there is to it. Employees don't get to prioritize one customer over others arbitrarily, and they certainly don't get to punish other customers for not giving into peer pressure. \n\nThis was some immature schoolyard BS. Pregnant lady could and should have waited in line just like everybody else. Being pregnant is hard, of course, but it's not a disability and she isn't automatically owed preferential treatment from everyone around her. If the employee really felt for her than they easily could've just called for a second cashier to make the line move quicker.", "Also, if it was going that slowly, sounds like they had a staff issue going on cause it seems like a register issue. An express lane for few items is common at most places, so gotta wonder how small a store this is tho.\n\nHonestly, leave a bad review and shop elsewhere if you have options. It just sounds like an exhausting place. Though, in general, many people would offer to let the person with a couple items go ahead of them, if we're talking about politeness, so the reaction makes zero sense", "I would have left. Got my 3 items at another store. But also is why I like self checkout.", "Ive been pregnant twice and went grocery shopping with a toddler while pregnant. I would never go in front of someone who only has THREE items when I have a full cart. It\u2019s inconsiderate of their time.

There was one time I offered to let someone before me because they had only two items.", "Where do live that that's the case?\nGenerally,  that's true for things such as dedicated seating on public transport , and is courteous even for non- dedicated seating, but it doesn't normally apply to things like queues in shops.", "I agree, I'm currently very pregnant and have a toddler, I would never ask either.  I'm just saying if someone very pregnant with a toddler asked me, I would absolutely let them.", "Not the commenter but in Portugal there is priority for:\n\n-Handicapped\n\n-Elderly\n\n-Pregnant women\n\n-People with a carried child (like a baby on your arms)", "I live in Argentina"]}
