Maria did not want the pregnant woman to stand in front of her, but said that I should let her stand in front of me. Pregnant woman was also little bit annoyed but she wasnt saying anything.

Employees don't get to prioritize one customer over others arbitrarily, and they certainly don't get to punish other customers for not giving into peer pressure. \n\nThis was some immature schoolyard BS. Pregnant lady could and should have waited in line just like everybody else.
