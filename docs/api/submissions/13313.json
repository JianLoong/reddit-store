They don't care if your daughter is there every day, or once a month as long as you're paying the bill.", "Going to go for the hot take here, as someone who has worked in camp/after school for many years. \n\nESH. \n\nY.T.A. (Gently) because the counselor is right to a point, ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s a govt subsidized program. I worked for the YMCA for years doing after school. We had a capacity limit. We had loads of kids that only came two or three days a week, but we weren\u2019t allowed to remove them for that reason. However, for every kid that didn\u2019t come every day, we had two kids who wanted (or needed) to come every day but they weren\u2019t allowed to sign up at all until next year or until people were formally removed. We had parents who worked two jobs begging us for spots, because their kid needed somewhere safe to be until 6pm. We had to turn them away because we had 15+ kids who only came sometimes. Them not coming also fucked go our attendance data and therefore our funding. It looks really bad for a program of you have a bunch of kids that are signed up but don\u2019t attend regularly. It impacted if we were granted hot supper by the city/state. If our daily numbers dipped low enough, they\u2019d take away free meals, which a bunch of our kids relied on as their dinner. I also work with a partially subsidized but very expensive private after school. Same problem. Loads of low income kids with vouchers who would be there every day were only denied spots because we had a bunch of kids that despite paying full price would leave early or not come at all several days a week because they had other clubs and activities. Not to mention it messes with ratios and staffing\u2026 the number of times my group was merged with another group because half our kids were out AGAIN in order to maintain ratio was absurd. If your kid is consistently under-utilizing the program, maybe consider another kind of program or see if they\u2019d accept a \u201csplit attendance\u201d model, where your kid attends on specific days but the days where she\u2019s consistently not in there\u2019s another child who can be in attendance in her place? \n\nThe counselor is ALSO an a-hole because she\u2019s clearly only doing all this so her own daughter can take your daughter\u2019s place, and that\u2019s fucked. It\u2019s one thing to genuinely be concerned about other kids in the community being able to access the program if your daughter is consistently under attending, it\u2019s another to say your daughter should be removed so HER CHILD SPECIFICALLY can attend. OP should 10000% be contacting the boss of this counselor and let them know that they\u2019re being chased off by a staff member who wants her kid in.", "NTA. counselor shouldn't even be saying this mess to you. You should probably have a conversation with her and the head of the school. She is completely out of line.", "NTA- she still goes most the time and you pay for all 5 days a week.", "NTA- if you don't have a full plan, then don't put yourself in danger.", "Nta and if it were me I\u2019d be talking to the director.

That's what it sounds like this counselor is doing. They are targeting you and attempting to bully you to get what they want. It's bad parent behavior in general but the fact that this is a counselor that works there is huge concern. \nI don't mean to be an alarmist, but is it possible for this counselor to do or say something that would affect your child when she is there?

It's understandable that the counselor is in a tough spot, but it's not fair for her to pressure you into giving up your daughter's spot in the program. You're paying for the full week, regardless of how many days she attends, and you have a legitimate need for after-school care. It's not your responsibility to make accommodations for the counselor's situation.

I understand you pay but so will someone else who is gonna use it full time.", "NTA - That's sucks for the newest camp counselor that the camp is full but is ultimately not your problem.

Their post history is full of comments from today that make zero sense in context, as well as at least one stolen, reworded comment.", "Bot, comment stolen from u/FatChance68", "[removed]", "But she does attend, 70% of the time. It's not like we're talking about an academic program where she'll fall behind if she misses 1-2 days a week. OP is paying for her space in the program even on the days that she isn't there and she's still attending more often than she's absent.", "It's not like its a prep school or anything like that. It's an after school program for 6 year olds. Attendance isn't mandatory. \n\nNo program like this is just going to boot a kid out because they miss some days here and there. Especially not when the parent is paying the full price every week whether her child is there or not.", "The days the kid isnt there needing looking after...so staff are paid yo watch a kid that theu dont have to watch...im sure the program wpuld love to have their program filled with kids like OPs.", "NTA\n\nWhy does she think that she'll automatically get your kid's spot even if you were to pull her? Sounds like there's probably a list of people somewhere who would be ahead of her if she's brand new.\n\nYou paid for a spot. She thinks it should be hers. She's the entitled one, not you.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s actually the one being entitled. You\u2019re paying for the spot. It\u2019s yours. How often your daughter does or doesn\u2019t go is actually irrelevant. \n\nShe seems to think she\u2019s entitled to it because she works there. She\u2019s not. \n\nThis is her problem. Tell her you are done discussing it and that if she can\u2019t be professional, you\u2019ll reach out to whoever is above her and report her harassment.", "Could your daughter stay for the five days instead of 3 or 4? Since it's an awesome program, it would be a positive time for your daughter. And the counselor? Her son, not your problem. NTA.", "NTA. I can see why there could be problems with a kid not attending every day they are signed up. \n\nBut that\u2019s not happening here, she wants your spot for herself. Really, it\u2019s a conflict of interest and unprofessional behavior bc she is trying to use her influence as a counselor to benefit herself at the expense of a customer and camp. \n\nI recommend tell her next time she brings it up, \u201cit much be hard. However, I signed up for the camp because my child needs the camp and I will not be withdrawing her. Please do not bring it up again.\u201d \n\nIf she try, just say \u201cI am not discussing this\u201d then escalate it with whoever is in charge.", ">This issue lies with the newest camp counselor.\n\nNTA. That new counselor needs to be fired for confronting a customer and trying to make them drop out for their own benefit.", "It's like....\n\nIf you were at Target, and there was one blue shirt left, and you went to buy it, and the Target employee told you it's selfish to buy that shirt because blue doesn't even look good on you and she can tell you already have loads of other shirts at home, and she wanted the shirt for herself, and she can't believe you're buying it.\n\nLike imagine if that happened. That person would be fired immediately. It's a crazy scenario.\n\nSo NTA, not at all. And yes, tell the administration....this is incredibly inappropriate behavior.", "You are right, it is bullying.", "I adore that response\u2026 Saving that for when I need to go claws out at someone.\n\nSo catty, yet honest!!!", "From a business perspective, I\u2019m sure the admins would be very interested to know a counselor is trying to get a kid paying full price to leave so they can pay a discounted rate. They\u2019d be out some cash.", "You are looking for problems where there are none. there is nothing iffy about this except your take on this"]}
