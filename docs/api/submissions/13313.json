As you stated clearly- you can afford it, you do need it full time based on your schedule - and I would also add that you harm no one when you don't use it. The counselors probably like having one less kid once in awhile and the other kids in the program don't care. \n\nGiven that this counselor didn't just ask you once time, but is trying to pressure you and using rude language (calling you entitled), I would suggest you going full passive aggressive by emailing/speaking with the director of the program. \n\nPTA white lady time:\n\nHi director, Counselor X informed me that your program continues to be full and that my daughter not always using the program is causing issues, particularly that her child can't enroll because of it.

I wanted to reach out to see if there were other solutions besides me removing my child, because I certainly do not want that, but also don't want this counselor to be unhappy either, especially as the supervise my child. I hope we can make something work!\n\nNow you have fully outed this counselor as an asshole with a small aside that you \"just want to be helpful.\"", "NTA.  You  need to report this over her head.

You need to talk her administration immediately, harassing a parent to give up a spot in the program she works for solely because it will benefit her and giving you shit about using a service you pay for is absolutely inappropriate.

She\u2019s already proved herself to be 100% unprofessional, disrespectful, and honestly insulting. Paying for your child to be in an after school camp and having them in that camp is not entitled.

It was completely unprofessional for her to mention it to you, even once. I would talk to the administration immediately.\n\nWhat you are doing, paying for full time camp so that you have it available even if you don't always need it, is totally standard and legit. Most daycares, for example, charge for every week in the summer to \"hold\" the child's spot, even if the child doesn't use some of those weeks because of family vacations.
