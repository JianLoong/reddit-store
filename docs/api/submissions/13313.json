I\u2019m starting to feel awful because I know the counselor having her son there would be easier on her\u2026 but I pay for full weeks and some random weeks she is there all week.

It\u2019s not your responsibility, you signed your kid up fair and square.

Don\u2019t let her bully you. My sister pulled her kids out of after school care to save money. Now circumstances have changed. She doesn\u2019t have as much help with the kids.

Your job as a parent is to do the best you can raising YOUR child. You have a kind heart if you are listening to this other person and feeling concerned about HER problem- because it is NOT your problem! This is not a family or even a friend of yours and it it's *not your job to solve her problems*.  If you were to drop out to accommodate her, you would only be setting yourself up for difficulties that you neither need nor want. Stand your ground; you are doing nothing wrong here, and don't let her bully you out for her own personal benefit.", "NTA\n\nAll kids should have the right to after school care if it's needed. \n\nI don't really understand, 'cause I don't live in the US and those services are free where I'm from, but if your kid had a spot first and you pay your dues on time then I'd say that no one has more of a right to that spot than you. It's just bad luck that they weren't in a place to sign up earlier", "NTA\n\nUnless the service has minimum attendance requirements that you aren't meeting then you have nothing to feel bad about.\n\nPersonally I'd report the counsellor for such unprofessional behaviour but if you prefer to avoid conflict then just make it clear that you will not discuss this with them any further and walk away.", "NTA I would go over this gals head and tell them what she is saying.  You pay and that is your daughters spot.  My daughter goes to a similar after school program and she doesn\u2019t go everyday.
