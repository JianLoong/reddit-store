I enjoy cooking, he never forced me, even helped in the prep part when he could.\n\nLast night he got MIL (50F) from the airport, and I had no idea she was coming, he said he had no idea either until his dad called and told him to pick her up a few hours ago (while I was asleep) because this was a 'surprise' visit. \n\nThough it's perhaps because I was quite vocal about telling my husband to discourage her every time she talked about visiting, as she had a plethora of unwelcome suggestions (eg: sleep in the southwest direction to have a boy). \n\nI'm 38 weeks pregnant with twins and on bedrest since the last week, where my husband has been doing most of the cooking. His arsenal is limited to some stews, soups and rice, and it works for us. \n\nBut last night, MIL came in my room, made a bunch of comments about how I must have gotten used to not doing any work because of how dirty the house is, and then said I should be glad she's here to 'help', and finally declared that it's Thursday and she can't eat meat on Thursdays so I should cook her a vegetarian meal from scratch. \n\nI told her there's salad in the fridge and she got mad, insisting I should, and when I said I won't and that she can either ask her son or make it herself, she got angry and went out. \n\nHusband came in mad saying I disrespected her by refusing to cook for her, and that the bedrest was precautionary anyway and not worth disrespecting her because she went to bed hungry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: MIL wanted me to make food for her in the middle of the night and I said no.

He'd rather you make his mother food instead of resting as you are preparing to bring your shared children into the World? Instead of getting off his ass and making her some food? NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut you\u2019ve got a monster in law problem and a husband who won\u2019t stand up to his mother and thinks you\u2019re in the wrong\n\nYou need to shut this down right now because I suspect it\u2019s about to get a whole lot worse for you once the twins arrive\n\nI don\u2019t believe for a second he didn\u2019t know about the visit and I wouldn\u2019t put it past him to have complained to his mother and insisted she visit\n\nTime to be setting some major boundaries and if you\u2019re husband won\u2019t see reason maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider this marriage\n\nYou\u2019re not a maid and cook, You\u2019re supposed to be an equal partner in this relationship", "NTA. She showing up unannounced, insulted you and then insisted you make her a meatless meal because it was Thursday. If she needs a special meal, she can make it herself especially considering she was \"there to help\".", "NTA. Is your MIL Asian? \n\nHold your ground.", "NTA she's there to \"help\" yet at the same time demands you cook her a meal. That's not helpful.\n\nIt's a surprise visit, she can order a pizza. You're on bedrest for a reason. You're expecting twins. Have a serious word with your husband about how he needs to stand up for you and not bow to his mother's wishes. The health of your children is more important than not offending your MIL.", "NTA.  \n\nTalk to your husband, he should be on your side here and you both need to set some boundaries. Remind your dear husband his primary responsibility is the care for his own family, not habitual obedience to his mother.  \n \nI'll see you soon at r/justnoMIL", "Dude what? Naw. She needs to go, also not impressed with your momma\u2019s boy husband. \n\nNTA", "NTA she is a grown ass adult who can cook her own meal. I would sit your husband down and explain the dangers of carrying not only just one baby but two and how you are not a maid for your MIL. You should also explain to him that if she cannot respect you and your boundaries and keep her mouth shut with her unwanted opinions then she is not welcome in your home period.", "This sounds like a cultural issue. If your husband won't protect you and your babies who will? I'm not sure there is a solution, but NTA.", "NTA! You're on bedrest with twins, she wants you to cook for her during an unannounced visit, you're supposed to drop everything and **host** her and meet her diet requirements?! Wtf! \n\nIn the words of my (step) grandmother- if you show up at her house unannounced \"you take me as you find me\". \n\nStay in bed, there was salad in the fridge. If she wanted someone to prepare it for her, your husband was right there. You do not have to cater to someone in your own home when they were not invited, especially since you're heavily pregnant with twins and on bed rest. Holy crap I'll say it again louder **NTA!!**\n\nCongratulations by the way! Hopefully no unannounced visits when your babies are here with you. Your husband needs to speak up for you too.", "Easy NTA\n\nYou are pregnant, with twins in the last stretch of the process. The house not being \"spotless\" in a siutaion like this, even at the best of times, is NORMAL IMO. Sure the critizism is ok to take in but it kinda paints the picture of the person she seems to be.\n\nFor her preference in meal choice, I can agree she may have looked forward to the good meals you cook BUT the hissi-fit she had and went to bed hungry like a little brat out of protest is clearly out of line. She could have had a salad and could have offered to cook / help you with cooking the next day. Her behavior is even more entitled because it was a suprise visit and you could have prepared something IF she cared to tell you she was coming.\n\nI feel this is also a perfect opportunity to make it clear to her, she is always welcome here BUT if she is expecting something specific like the issue of the past night, then she can just do the common thing and TELL YOU that she is coming in ADVANCE.\n\nI love my family, I love my friends but I dislike suprise drop byes most of the times too! A \"sUpRiSe\" visit, especially when they come from another state, with little options of getting back quickly or other places to stay if something happens is quite frankly stupid.", "NTA\n\n1. She comes without any warning- she shouldn\u2019t expect anything. If you knew you would probably make some shoppings or cooking before her visit.\n2. Ether her pregnancy was very easy for her or she must forgotten how does it look. But you are in the finish of pregnancy with TWINS which means it\u2019s hard for you to do any basic things around home.\n3. It\u2019s not your fault she went sleep hungry, she could make food by her own or order something. As well she wasn\u2019t invited- she is not the guest, she came to your house to \u201chelp\u201d so she can cook meal for herself.\n\nConsider talking to your husband, maybe he got another version of that story, if not, be careful. If he is going to always take his mother side, life won\u2019t be easy for you.", "NTA.   \nYou need to have a serious talk with your husband. His disrespect for you cannot continue.\n\nBut not before you throw her out.", "NTA. So the MIL decided it was ok to show up for a surprise visit with almost no notice and expected a 38 month pregnant woman on bed rest to cook for her?! Seriously, what planet do some people live on...", "NTA, but your husband and MIL sure are. The idea that a wife should be a servant to her husband and his relatives doesn't belong in today's society. But those two are acting like it does. You should go on a total household strike. Don't do anything at all until your husband apologises and starts doing his part.", "NTA Husband is NOT helping things. And MIL is \"there to help\". She thinks she is going to be telling YOU what to do while she watches.\nTime for a \"private\" come to Jesus meeting with hubby, telling him you are on bed rest, will be following your docs orders, and if MIL is going to be a PITA, she can go home now. And maybe get your doc on the phone too.\n\nCongrats on making it to 38 weeks with twins! Have a beautiful delivery, and enjoy those babies!", "NTA. You're on bedrest and your husband should prioritize you and the little ones first, doctors put you on bedrest for a reason and I know this from a friend who has twins and was high risk so she was put on strict bedrest for the well being of her and the twins. If anything he should've stepped up and did what him own mother demanded. If my boyfriend did this I'd be questioning everything. Well wishes for your upcoming delivery!", "NTA OP, it was a surprise visit and you're nearing the end of your pregnancy with twins. I guess your MIL is SE Asian, and this might be a cultural thing.", "NTA\n\nI'd be telling her to fuck off home, and your husband to fuck off with her. Who do they think they are? Your husband should be looking after you. Why can't he cook for his mother?", "Omg so NTA!!! You\u2019re growing two humans. Inside of you. And you\u2019re almost done! You should continue your bed rest! She can cook for her own damn self or your husband can. That\u2019s fucking ridiculous it\u2019s even an issue.", "NTA. Your husband can cook for her or order in food.", "NTA Tell your MIL and husband to go take a hike. You're on bed rest for a reason. Perhaps it's time to tell your husband to either tell his Mommy Dearest to pack up and go home or to pack up and go with her.", "NTA. Bedrest is not thrown around lightly and you\u2019ve got not one, but two babies coming. I can\u2019t believe two capable adults got mad at you for not cooking for them. I\u2019ll bet they could both feed themselves if you weren\u2019t there.", "NTA - you are on bed rest. You should not be doing anything but growing babies. She is there to help or GTFO. Aka look after you and hubby so cooking & cleaning should now be her jobs or she leaves now.", "You should be glad she\u2019s here to help but also HOP TO IT AND COOK FOR HER, OP. What the effing what? Pick a lane, MIL.\n\nNTA\n\nHusband takes the gold medal in the AH Olympics for not standing up to his mom\u2019s ridiculous demand and being willing to endanger his wife and unborn child so his mom didn\u2019t feel \u2018disrespected\u2019.", "GET. HER. OUT. OF. YOUR. HOME. RIGHT. NOW.\n\n\"Precautionary bedrest\" does not mean the rest itself is precautionary. It means that your health professionals have recognised signs of a developing serious condition and are telling you that you *must* bedrest so that those conditions don't develop. \n\nYour MIL has turned up *uninvited* because she *knows* you would never have agreed to her coming. Tell your husband that if she's here to help then she should be *helping you*. If she creates any work for you them she is *hindering*. You have enough to deal with, his mother isn't your problem since you're busy *becoming* a mother. He can keep her out of your hair or he can get out and take her with him. Either way, she needs to be gone before the babies come and she gets her hooks into your routine.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Bedrest isn't just for the baby. Because technically, your husband is right, and you could go in there and make a three course meal and that baby is gonna be just fine in there so long as you don't try to do any backflips while you're cutting the vegetables. No, the bedrest is for YOU. You're literally growing a human inside of you. Idk who else isn't fucking amazed by the ability to do that, but I still am. You're growing a tiny human in there that will one day be as big as you are. And that takes a fucking toll on your body, much more than many people ever care to realize.\n\nYou don't need to be on your feet cooking and cleaning and running around after anybody, and especially not some random woman who busted in your door and demanded you make her a sandwich. Your body is going through hell right now and you need to take a fucking break. And so far, neither your husband or your MIL is treating you like a human being, but rather a machine that should cook and clean and carry babies, and apparently do all that at the same time. NTA and put your feet up. If either of them gives you shit, you can uninvite them from being in the room during the birth, and/or cite the traumatic shit your body is going through and will go through during and after birth.

If it's just to drop by, say hello, drop something off or anything else that is done within a few minutes then a suprise drop by is fine. But expecting to hang out and being moody because you didnt want to, thats clearly entitlement.  \nImagining people doing those \"suprises\" regularly gives me chills too."]}
