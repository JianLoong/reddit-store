Your husband needs to remove his head from his behind! He\u2019s willing to put your health, and the health of his babies in jeopardy because his mommy is throwing a tantrum? Noooope.

Actually no scratch that she can fuck off and go home period.", "NTA - when my wife was pregnant my folks and her sisters came and helped out during that process.  The whole point of them being there was to take care of a lot of the normal housework in the lead up to delivery and post partum recovery after c-section (which rarely gets acknowledged as such, but is a major freaking surgery).

You mentioned MIL came from another country, so I'm calling bs on your husband not knowing mommy dearest was coming.

My advice, next time, give her a takeout menu, and say that this isn't a restaurant, that she wasn't invited over and if she has specific dietary needs she's welcome to order in food, but this is your household, and you cook for yourself, and invited guests.

Tell her she is stressing you out and catch the next plane home!", "NTA do some research about what can go wrong with pregnancies. Reasons bed rest would be advised etc. Not to spook you or anything like that but to use to back yourself up when talking to your husband.\n\nHe and his mother were extremely disrespectful. Your doctor recommended bed rest for a reason. Sit your husband down, talk to him about his behavior, discuss all the scary things that could happen if you don't rest like medically advised. Then ask him does he want to be responsible for those things potentially happening to you. Potentially endangering your children.\n\nIf that doesn't help pull his head out of his arse and you can't set reasonable boundaries with him and his mother then I truly hope you have family you can stay with. You do not deserve to be treated with such disrespect from an uninvited impromptu house guest. They are both adults. Between the both of them they should be able to make a bloody meal without your help. \n\nYou need boundaries in place before you pop. You should feel safe and comfortable when it's time to have the kids. Not anxious about what it will be like when you come home with them.\n\nYour mother in law should be there to help. If she is only making life more difficult she doesn't deserve to be there. She is not behaving as a guest should. If she wants that kind of treatment then she can pay for a hotel.", ">But last night, MIL came in my room, made a bunch of comments about how I must have gotten used to not doing any work because of how dirty the house is\n\nThis was my GTFO right now moment. No worthwhile SO would put up with that kind of disrespect. \n\nNTA, but it looks like your husband has some growing up to do, and cutting that umbilical cord is his first step.", "NTA\n\nYour husband never should have picked her up.
