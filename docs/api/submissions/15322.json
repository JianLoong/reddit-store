If she wanted someone to prepare it for her, your husband was right there. You do not have to cater to someone in your own home when they were not invited, especially since you're heavily pregnant with twins and on bed rest.

She could have had a salad and could have offered to cook / help you with cooking the next day. Her behavior is even more entitled because it was a suprise visit and you could have prepared something IF she cared to tell you she was coming.\n\nI feel this is also a perfect opportunity to make it clear to her, she is always welcome here BUT if she is expecting something specific like the issue of the past night, then she can just do the common thing and TELL YOU that she is coming in ADVANCE.\n\nI love my family, I love my friends but I dislike suprise drop byes most of the times too!

And maybe get your doc on the phone too.\n\nCongrats on making it to 38 weeks with twins! Have a beautiful delivery, and enjoy those babies!", "NTA. You're on bedrest and your husband should prioritize you and the little ones first, doctors put you on bedrest for a reason and I know this from a friend who has twins and was high risk so she was put on strict bedrest for the well being of her and the twins. If anything he should've stepped up and did what him own mother demanded. If my boyfriend did this I'd be questioning everything.

HER. OUT. OF. YOUR. HOME. RIGHT. NOW.\n\n\"Precautionary bedrest\" does not mean the rest itself is precautionary.

Tell your husband that if she's here to help then she should be *helping you*. If she creates any work for you them she is *hindering*. You have enough to deal with, his mother isn't your problem since you're busy *becoming* a mother. He can keep her out of your hair or he can get out and take her with him.
