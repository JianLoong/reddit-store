You 100% made the right choice and don't let her make you feel bad for it. She should instead be comforting you over your grandmother's ill health which show how one-sided this friendship probably is.\n\n Also you are never wrong for not wanting to go to a destination wedding.

Her wedding is not more important than your dying grandmother! What\u2019s wrong with you? Why would you even ask this question?!", "NTA.\n\nAnd if Claire doesn't understand, she's nor somebody you really want in your life.", "NTA - The rule is always family first and since you may have many friends, you only have two at the most grandmothers.

This is such outrageous reaction on her part towards you, it would be an immediate NC with her for me.", "NTA, talk about main character syndrome, how Claire doesn\u2019t understand is beyond me.

If Claire has an issue with it, you\u2019re just as well to sever the friendship (a real friend would have supported you)", "NTA.

Shame on her", "You are not the asshole.  Family is important. I have been in your shoes before and it is agrivating when someone doesn't understand or refuses to understand the situation.", "NTA, and you\u2019re not the person in this scenario who\u2019s being unsupportive and selfish. It\u2019s reasonable for Claire to *feel* disappointed and upset, but a supportive friend would have completely understood and accepted your decision, and kept her feelings to herself.", "NTA.  Your grandmother was dying.  Your friend was expecting you to foot the bill for her self aggrandized vacation.  Grandma wins, hands down.  Your friend does not come off looking good expecting you to abandon a loved family member in their final hours.

It is not \u201cunderstandable\u201d to be upset that you are looking after a close relative in her last days!  It\u2019s unconscionable.  NTA.  This is becoming a pet peeve of mine.

Why do people think their wedding is as important to everyone they know as it is to themselves???? Claire need some perspective - your grandmother has loved you your entire life, of course getting to spend time with her is your priority. If Claire honestly thinks you are in any way selfish for your choice, then she is not actually a friend.", "NTA. Tell her you\u2019ll go to her next wedding.", "I\u2019m sorry, a dying grandma is more important than a friends big destination party. \n\nYou know you did the right thing. It\u2019s too bad that your friend isn\u2019t mature enough to understand that. I\u2019m sure Claire had plenty of other people around her to \u201csupport\u201d her at her big event. NTA", "NTA. That\u2019s some audacity to call you selfish for wanting to spend time with your grandmother in her final moments. A wedding should NEVER supersede saying goodbye forever to a loved one. Her lack of self awareness is outstanding. If you lose a friendship over this, I\u2019d say good riddance - she clearly does not value you or your family.", "I get why she feels hurt, you missing a milestone moment is gunna be hard for her so give her some time. Just to confirm, you\u2019re not a bridesmaid and you not going to wedding is just you won\u2019t be there and not like your absence will lose a dynamic part of the ceremony?", "NTA \n\nAnd most likely OP being there would take the attention away from Claire, as fiends and guest offer condolences and well wishes based on her grandmother\u2019s condition.\n\nHowever it also highlights an selfish attitude in Claire that op may have missed in the past. Because unless I missed something Op isn\u2019t even in the wedding party so it just cruel to ask someone to miss saying goodbye to their family for what I\u2019m guessing is Claire\u2019s first wedding?", "NTA. You are actually not selfish but empathic wanting to be with your grandmama. I think it\u2019s more then natural you\u2019d want to spend time with her. She should have some understanding and not be so selfish herself. \n\nGood luck with your grandma. Take care. \ud83c\udf3a", "NTA\n\nImagine how you would have felt if your grandmother died while you were partying it up at Claire's wedding.  It's super unfortunate that the timing coincided with the wedding but it happened.", "Someone being understandably upset would say something along the lines of that really sucks, we will miss you at the wedding. I am sorry your grandmother is ill, I understand your need to go be with her. \n\nWhat your \"friend\" is doing is being selfish, thinking everything revolves around her. That is selfish main character energy. Just because she comes first in her life does mean she comes first in your life. \n\nYou are much better off without this \"friend\" \nNTA", "NTA. If my friend had to miss my wedding because their grandmother was dying, you know what I would do? I would tell them I\u2019m so sorry for what they are going through, tell them not to worry about missing the wedding, and would then ask if there\u2019s anything I could do for my friend as she\u2019s about to lose someone she loves. \nThat\u2019s the appropriate response to this.\nHas your friendship with Claire always been so one-sided?", "NTA.  Fuck Claire.", "Damn grandma!  Planning on ruining poor, darling, downtrodden Claire's foreign vacation!!\n\n\nOP, again, NTA.  Claire sure is though.", "This!", "NTA - Claire is a narcissist. She will never care about you. She only cares about herself.", "NTA, family should come first. Hopefully Claire can understand that. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t feel down, spend the last hours with your grandmother. It will mean a lot for her.", "NTA", "NTA - if someone told me i was selfish for missing their wedding becuase i wanted to be with my dying family member final moments i would have told that person to go F themselves.", "NTA. Claire is being immature and selfish. It\u2019s her big day, not yours, and YOUR GRANDMOTHER IS DYING. Sorry to shout that, but it\u2019s not a trivial reason. SMH", "Tell your friend she's famous on Reddit now for being a selfish insensitive AH. But you are NTA", "NTA her wedding doesn't rule over your grandmother's life. Bad friend to even have an attitude about that. She would be blasted heavily throughout the media if she even tried to tell people she was upset her friend wouldn't come to her wedding because of her dying grandmother. Yeah that's how selfish she sounds.", "Definitely NTA. The lack of empathy coming from Claire is concerning. I know that people get stressed with wedding planning, but this was not an appropriate response to learning that a close friend\u2019s grandmother was given months to live. Again NTA.", "NTA, people who plan destination weddings aren't known for their selflessness.", "I hope you mean ex friend. 100%", "NTA. I am sooooo sick of brides expecting everybody else to bow down because of their \u201cbig day\u201d with no regards to real life issues happening with other folks. You did the right thing by being with your dying grandmother.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry you found yourself in this situation. A true friend is someone that while being disappointed would tell you how sad they are about your grandma and encourage you to go be with her and understand that the timing was just bad but it doesn\u2019t mean you love your friend any less. At best she was wrapped up in herself and her wedding and couldn\u2019t realize life is going on for other people too-time doesn\u2019t stop for a wedding. At worst she\u2019s not a true friend and is selfish and uncaring and she showed you her true colors and do yourself a favor and walk away. I hope you send a nice gift with a beautiful thoughtful card because that\u2019s appropriate here, or even plan a time to take them out or have them over for a nice meal to go over pictures and hear all about the trip and celebrate them the best you can after.

You will regret not spending as much time\nWith your grandmother as you can, trust me on this. My grandma died in March 21, I still regret not going to see her more before Covid b/c her dementia got so much worse during lockdown.

Claire does not sound like a good friend", "NTA and I gotta say your friendship is questionable if she couldn\u2019t understand your reason why.", "NTA, not even remotely. Your so-called friend is the selfish one. As if her event takes precedence in everyone's life, when it's actually only of first importance to her and her spouse.", "NTA. My grandmother just passed away in April and I\u2019m endlessly thankful that I dropped everything to see her before she passed. I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. Do not regret your decision. There is nothing selfish about your choice and if she can\u2019t see that then she is not a good friend.", "NTA you can attend her next wedding.", "NTA. Are you sure this woman is really your friend? She gad no empathy at all. Demanding you choose her over a final visit with your grandmother is extremely self and narcissistic. Think about kther things she has demanded of you. Think about it she has been there for you when you needed someone. Is this so called friendship worth bring guilty into missing one last visit with grandma?", "NTA! I am amazed at the number of incredibly selfish, self centered brides that have been exposed by AITA. If Claire couldn't see past herself in this situation then she is not a real friend. Don't give her another thought, she's not worth it. She owes you an apology.", "NTA. I was in the hospital doing cancer treatment when my best friends grandma was dying and I understood that took priority over visiting me. I was more upset about the fact that I couldn't be there for my friend in the moment.\nClaire is not understandably upset. She's being an asshole if she thinks a wedding takes priority over a family member dying. No one cares about a wedding as much as the bride and groom. I wouldn't cut them off right away, maybe she's under a lot of stress and people say alot of things they don't mean when under stress. Give it some time and if Claire still has the same opinion, I would highly be reconsidering this friendship.", "NTA\n\nDestination weddings are a)expensive and b)often somewhere far away.    \nWhen someone plans a destination wedding, they need to deal with the fact that it will eliminate some people from attending.", "NTA.\n\nI cannot *imagine* being upset with a friend for missing my wedding in order to be with a dying family member. Or even a seriously ill or injured family member. I may be *disappointed* that I won\u2019t get to celebrate with that person, but that is my private feeling to manage on my own, and it\u2019s certainly not going to turn into *anger*. Life doesn\u2019t stop for everyone just because someone is getting married. \n\nLet\u2019s hope this is just temporary insanity on Claire\u2019s part, and she comes to you with an abject apology and her best wishes for your family soon.", "i would have been at the wedding. but is was also cross with grandma after she played favourites as long as i knew her. rest in hell. (yes i talk bad about bad ppl even after they die)", "She may have been your friend, but you aren't hers.", "Unsupportive and selfish is someone who feels their wedding is more important than a friend's dying relative.\n\nNTA", "Nta. Claire is selfish! Your grandma is very ill. If you went to the wedding and something happened to your grandma you would never forgive yourself but I guarantee Claire wouldn\u2019t feel guilty. Selfish! You have your priorities right! If Claire was a better friend she would see that.", "NTA. She's not a good friend if she doesn't let this go.", "OP doesn't actually say she's visiting. She also says grandma has months left. If she phrased it the same way to her friend I can see how it could come off as less urgent. Maybe she needs to be more clear about the circumstances.", "NTA. \n\nMy great-aunt, who I was reasonably close with, died a few days before my best friend\u2019s wedding. The funeral was held on friend\u2019s wedding day. My friend very quickly suggested that I go to the funeral, miss out on the getting ready, and meet up at the wedding whenever I was ready.

Hey, if she\u2019d had a local wedding, you almost certainly would have been able to go.

How selfish was she??\n\nnta  but claire is.", "NTA \n\nWhoa, what a selfish friend this bride is.\n\nFirst, destination weddings are selfish, forcing people to use extra money to see the wedding.\n\nAnd second and appalling, she thinks her wedding is more important than the last days of a dying relative? Ugh.", "You were losing someone very important to you. If that leads to you losing a second person from your life, that just means you aren\u2019t actually very important to her. I am sorry for the loss of your grandma and also for the fact that your friend might not really be a friend\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Claire is not being \"understandably upset\" she is being selfish and childish. Her calling you selfish and unsupportive because god forbid you have a family member dying, is pretty horrid.   Her wedding does not take precedence over your grandmother during her final days.  It's a shame you are going to miss the wedding, but you may not have the chance to see your grandmother again before she passes.  Things in life happen and sometimes we have to make difficult decisions that aren't always going to make everyone happy.  You have to do what is right to you.

Got a call from my friend  (known eachother since we were kids) his 5 yo kiddo likely had a uti and the only appointment time they could get was smack bang in the middle of our ceremony.I told them not to worry about us, get the kiddo seen (uti and kids are just horrible for them) and text me how it goes. The kid ended up being fine (yay) but i dont understand how brides loose their shit when people have a valid reason gor not coming last minute, like a sick kid or god forbid a family member passing away.", "NTA.

A friend would understand your decision\n A Prima Donna would not", "Yeah, if Claire was disappointed or sad, that would be completely understandable, but to get upset because a close friend wants to spend time with their dying grandma is just... talk about a one-sided friendship.", "It\u2019s a good thing that Claire doesn\u2019t exist then and this whole post is bullshit lmao", "the kettle *and* the pot are on that particular wedding gift registry", "Did OP say months in a comment?
