Claire was not \"understandably\" upset. She was selfishly upset. She is out of her mind if she thinks her wedding is more important than your grandmother. You 100% made the right choice and don't let her make you feel bad for it. She should instead be comforting you over your grandmother's ill health which show how one-sided this friendship probably is.\n\n Also you are never wrong for not wanting to go to a destination wedding. They're fine and all but no one should ever be EXPECTED to go.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not \"selfish\" for VISITING YOUR DYING GRANDMOTHER.  Claire is selfish for demanding your attendance.", "> She accused me of being unsupportive and selfish\n\nOh, the irony.\n\nNTA", "Wasn\u2019t it horrible of your grandma to start dying just to mess with her wedding? Tell her you\u2019ll be at the next one, with that attitude it won\u2019t be long.", "NTA. SHE called YOU *selfish* ??! The nerve of the woman! Her wedding is not more important than your dying grandmother! What\u2019s wrong with you? Why would you even ask this question?!", "NTA.\n\nAnd if Claire doesn't understand, she's nor somebody you really want in your life.", "NTA - The rule is always family first and since you may have many friends, you only have two at the most grandmothers.  The selfish one here is really Claire and she is not really the friend you thought she was.  This is such outrageous reaction on her part towards you, it would be an immediate NC with her for me.", "NTA, talk about main character syndrome, how Claire doesn\u2019t understand is beyond me. I\u2019m sorry about your grandma, you went where you needed to be, no regrets. If Claire has an issue with it, you\u2019re just as well to sever the friendship (a real friend would have supported you)", "NTA. She will get over it and maybe you should reconsider this \"friendship\". There are more important things. In life than somebodys wedding. The death and health of a loved one Trumps that. Shame on her", "You are not the asshole.  Family is important. I have been in your shoes before and it is agrivating when someone doesn't understand or refuses to understand the situation.", "NTA, and you\u2019re not the person in this scenario who\u2019s being unsupportive and selfish. It\u2019s reasonable for Claire to *feel* disappointed and upset, but a supportive friend would have completely understood and accepted your decision, and kept her feelings to herself.", "NTA.  Your grandmother was dying.  Your friend was expecting you to foot the bill for her self aggrandized vacation.  Grandma wins, hands down.  Your friend does not come off looking good expecting you to abandon a loved family member in their final hours.  One of you is selfish, and unsupportive but it isn't you, and it wasn't grandma.  \n\nMy condolences for your loss of grandma.", "\u201cUnderstandably upset?\u201d  No!  It is not \u201cunderstandable\u201d to be upset that you are looking after a close relative in her last days!  It\u2019s unconscionable.  NTA.  This is becoming a pet peeve of mine.  I have to stop reading these crazy bride posts.  They send my blood pressure through the roof.", "The selfish person here is Claire. \nNTA", "NTA Given it was somewhat sudden, it is somewhat selfish of Claire.

I can't believe how entitled your so-called friend is, to expect her wedding to matter more than your grandmother's life.\n\nHer wedding is HER priority, not yours.

Why do people think their wedding is as important to everyone they know as it is to themselves???? Claire need some perspective - your grandmother has loved you your entire life, of course getting to spend time with her is your priority. If Claire honestly thinks you are in any way selfish for your choice, then she is not actually a friend.", "NTA. Tell her you\u2019ll go to her next wedding.", "I\u2019m sorry, a dying grandma is more important than a friends big destination party. \n\nYou know you did the right thing. It\u2019s too bad that your friend isn\u2019t mature enough to understand that. I\u2019m sure Claire had plenty of other people around her to \u201csupport\u201d her at her big event. NTA", "NTA. That\u2019s some audacity to call you selfish for wanting to spend time with your grandmother in her final moments. A wedding should NEVER supersede saying goodbye forever to a loved one. Her lack of self awareness is outstanding. If you lose a friendship over this, I\u2019d say good riddance - she clearly does not value you or your family.", "I get why she feels hurt, you missing a milestone moment is gunna be hard for her so give her some time. Just to confirm, you\u2019re not a bridesmaid and you not going to wedding is just you won\u2019t be there and not like your absence will lose a dynamic part of the ceremony?", "NTA \n\nAnd most likely OP being there would take the attention away from Claire, as fiends and guest offer condolences and well wishes based on her grandmother\u2019s condition.\n\nHowever it also highlights an selfish attitude in Claire that op may have missed in the past. Because unless I missed something Op isn\u2019t even in the wedding party so it just cruel to ask someone to miss saying goodbye to their family for what I\u2019m guessing is Claire\u2019s first wedding?", "NTA. You are actually not selfish but empathic wanting to be with your grandmama. I think it\u2019s more then natural you\u2019d want to spend time with her. She should have some understanding and not be so selfish herself. \n\nGood luck with your grandma. Take care. \ud83c\udf3a", "NTA\n\nImagine how you would have felt if your grandmother died while you were partying it up at Claire's wedding.  It's super unfortunate that the timing coincided with the wedding but it happened.", "Someone being understandably upset would say something along the lines of that really sucks, we will miss you at the wedding. I am sorry your grandmother is ill, I understand your need to go be with her. \n\nWhat your \"friend\" is doing is being selfish, thinking everything revolves around her. That is selfish main character energy. Just because she comes first in her life does mean she comes first in your life. \n\nYou are much better off without this \"friend\" \nNTA", "NTA. If my friend had to miss my wedding because their grandmother was dying, you know what I would do?
