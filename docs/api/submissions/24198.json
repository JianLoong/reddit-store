I (29M) found myself caught in a storm of emotions, struggling to come to terms with a secret that had the potential to shatter my family.\n\nMy older sister (33F) had always been the  GOLDEN child, she used to be the best in school, university and found the PERFECT job, she\u2019s the one everyone admired and looked up to. I must say, when we all lived together under one roof, I never felt \u201ctoo\u201d left out. Some experiences, that other people think of as most beautiful, were destroyed by her. I wish we grew close, but we never did. She kept her distance and we never had a good Brother-Sister relationship.\n\nBut what nobody knew about her was that she had a deep secret. She had been having an affair with our cousin's husband. He and I have a quite good connection. I\u2019m not saying what he\u2019s doing is okay, he\u2019s an asshole for cheating. The main reason I felt inclined to cast her in a negative light is because she attempted the same behavior with multiple husbands within our extended family.\n\nI accidentally stumbled upon this revelation while going through my sister's phone to find a recipe. And there they were, a series of messages and photos that painted a questionable picture, leaving me in complete disbelief.\n\nI'll admit, my curiosity got the best of me, and I was really nosy. I couldn't help myself from looking into more messages to find out additional information.\n\nAs the reunion dinner commenced, I couldn't bear the thought of my cousin being deceived, living in blissful ignorance of her husband's betrayal and my sister's involvement. It really messed with me and I didn\u2019t want to hold it in anymore.\n\nIn a moment of feelings intense emotion, I blurted out the truth to the entire family. The room fell into silence as everyone processed the bombshell I had just dropped. My sister turned white as a sheet, her eyes wide with shock.\n\nThe atmosphere shifted from festive to explosive. Accusations flew, voices were raised, and tears streamed down faces. My cousin's heartbreak was hard to see, and my family was torn apart.\n\nMy sister was furious, accusing me of betrayal and ruining the big reunion day. My parents were devastated. The rest of the family was divided, with some condemning my decision to reveal the truth and others applauding my honesty.\n\nAs I went home I got bombed by messages of my relatives saying I ruined the day. Some of them, don\u2019t ever want to talk to me again\n\nIt left me questioning. I\u2019d totally understand if I\u2019m the asshole in this situation. I might chose the wrong time, but I also thought it\u2019s good for everyone to know. My sister is not an angel like everyone said. I know she has more secrets.\n\nSo, AITA for unleashing a secret during a reunion dinner?", "created_utc": 1691512050, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lmz1h/aita_for_unleashing_a_secret_during_a_family/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Think about what you did to your cousin.  It\u2019s not just that you blew up her life, but that you did it in such a public way that left her with no privacy to process this information and figure out what to do with it.  That was incredibly cruel. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like you did it because you really thought it was in her best interest, you did it to take your sister down a notch in the eyes of your family.  So basically you used your cousin and her pain as a weapon for your own selfish purposes. \n\nAgain, YTA.", "YTA. You should have handled this privately with your cousin and told her what her husband was up to. No need to make the whole thing a big scene in front of everyone.", "YTA. There is a way to deal with these kinds of situations without ripping the entire family apart and humiliating innocent parties involved. \n\nYou chose the nuclear option and have hurt not just your sister (who deserved it) but your cousin who is innocent in this entire situation. \n\nYour cousin absolutely didn't deserve to have the truth slapped in her face in front of the entire family. She was publically humiliated by your revelation and not given the even the smallest consideration or respect to process anything privately. You owe her a huge apology, you were so unfair to her.", "Yes\n\nYTA\n\n\u201cI thought it\u2019s good for everyone to know.\u201d  Not your dirty laundry to share. You took away your cousins right to deal with it in her own way.  Now people will be talking behind her back, maybe even laughing at her as her entire life is dissected and gossiped about. \n\nYou didn\u2019t help your cousin, you publicly humiliated her.  \n\nEdit:  Oh wait, this wasn\u2019t about exposing an affair, this was about taking down your sister in the ugliest and most public way possible no matter the collateral damage. What did your cousin ever do to you?", "you fucked with your cousin\u2019s ENTIRE life because you\u2019re jealous of your sister. and you\u2019re asking if you\u2019re an asshole or not?? dude\u2026", "I love drama in other people's homes, the poor wife didn't deserve to be exposed like this. YTA but your sister and husband's cousin are too", "YTA - you know. This was a very ugly way to do this and you ruined the event.", "You wanted to start stuff, you did. Congratulations. You could have told your cousin privately, to save her public humiliation. But you wanted to take your sister down. YTA for your choice of delivery.", "YTA\n\nYou could have taken your cousin to the side, privately and spoke with her. You just wanted to start drama to upset the \"golden child\"", "\"It left me questioning. I\u2019d totally understand if I\u2019m the asshole in this situation.\"\n\nYTA. It is not all about you.", "YTA.\n\nThe person you hurt most by doing it this way was your cousin, you know that, right? Like yeah, you managed to make it clear to everyone that your sister is not perfect. But the cost of it was devastating to your cousin who found out this awful truth in the eye of her family. You blew up her life publicly just to make your sister look bad.\n\nYou should have told your cousin the truth and let her decide how she wanted to handle it. This is her mess, not yours.", "YTA\n\nNo, it was not \"good for everyone to know\". It was good for your cousin, the one who was being betrayed to know. This was not something for the entire family. This was not at all about being a good relation to your cousin, this was about destroying your golden child sister in the most public way possible regardless of how much collateral damage it caused. You even added on you know more secrets about your sister at the end showing this was all about you getting revenge instead of helping someone out of a bad marriage. Grow up and get some therapy.", "Yes, YTA, but you already know that.  What made you destroy a family reunion?  What possible motive could you have other than to humiliate your sister so that you could feel superior?  You can\u2019t take this back, words of apology will never cover your harsh and uncaring actions.  Did you think of how your cousin\u2019s wife would react?  Or anyone else?  It\u2019s unfortunate that you are 29, and so self-serving and adolescent.  Your temporal lobe never reached maturity.  This would or will likely be a deal breaker for any future relationship you might get have.", "YTA - what is wrong with you???", "ESH. If you cared that much about your cousin you would have told them in private where they could process this information. Instead you decided to cause a scene because you clearly have unresolved issues regarding your sister.", "YTA. Yes your cousin deserved to know that her marriage was a lie. No she didn't deserve to be blindsided by this in front of her whole family. Forget your sister and what she did, why would you do this to your cousin. If you needed to tell anyone, it should have been done in private. This just sounds like you wanting to shit on your sister so everyone knows she's not that great after all. That's kind of pathetic.", "You might have saved your cousin's life, so you were right to let her know.  But every single other thing about this was wrong.  The time, the place, the *audience*... yeah, YTA.", "Wrong place, wrong time, wrong audience. YTA.", "YTA. This was all an act of revenge. Your only interest was humiliating your sister, not telling your cousin the truth.", "YTA and you know it.  This story just screams made up bs.  I honestly don't believe a word of it!", "Im sorry please explain how in any way you dont think you are the asshole in this situation? There is a time and place for everything and this was not it. Also you looked more through your sisters phone? Thats a big invassion of privacy. YTA.", "NTA", "YTA. I feel sorry for her. The humiliation she must have felt because you couldn't keep your mouth shut until a better more tactful time. WTF is wrong with you? Do you honestly not see yourself in an AH light?", "YTA. That was NOT the right place to tell. You were so wrong. Did the people \u201cinvolved\u201d deserve to know? Yes. But your cousin\u2019s humiliation of a cheating spouse with a family member\u2026shouldn\u2019t have been flaunted at the family reunion.", "YTA. Your sister and her affair partner probably deserves what they got but the decent thing to do would have been to minimize the collateral damage and tell your cousin privately. Instead, you chose to blindside her in an effort to punish your sister.", "NTA\nFucking legend.", "Clearly you're in love with your own drama.\n\nYTA", "They're more upset at OP for pointing it out than they are at the person who did the bad thing. This sounds like my family.", "YTA. ugly, petty choices being made because of your insecurities. You\u2019re 29 and making choices like a 17 year old. This was not the place nor the time. You should have just left the reunion and met up with your cousin on a separate date to tell her what you found.", "[removed]", "NTA.   Your sister and your cousins spouse ruined their marriages, and fucked up their spouses lives.\n\nWhat were you supposed to ignore this, and then deal with it on the sly?  Maybe have a second family gathering.\n\nNah. You stood up for the family values that your family supposedly supports.  Perfect sister, perfect marriage, perfect job, perfect whatever.  She was cheating.  You cousins spouse was cheating.\n\nGood on you for standing up for family values, and family traditions.  Nobody does this anymore for exactly the reason you are experiencing here.", "[deleted]", "NTA.  I'm guessing the YTA's are people who think this should have been left alone because they don't want their behavior outed.  \n\nYour sister's behavior was terrible, and maybe it wasn't the right place, but when is it?  That's the trap abusers try and put you into.", "NTA. \n\nEveryone has seen that person who tells someone who's being cheated on that they're being cheated on and then the messenger gets shot. Or they somehow get blamed for destroying a marriage. No you outed them publicly in a place where they could not lie. The family that's mad at you for ruining the reunion is pretty pathetic that they care more about a nice reunion than the fact that your sister is cheating with a family member.\n\nAsk them if they're going to get pissed off if an elderly relative passes away during the holidays or someone dares to get sick during a birthday party. Life happens and it's messy sometimes.", "Yep, it is always the messenger who gets punished.", "Honest question for all the YTA votes: How would you recommend OP handle this situation?", "That sounds like a good family reunion", "Fuck I woulda payed to see that \u2026it wouldn\u2019t of been such a bombshell if the truth wasn\u2019t so bad\u2026all you did was expose the truth .. can\u2019t  condemn a man for that NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can\u2019t imagine how humiliating that was for her. I\u2019m not sure you cared about her feelings at all. I think you just wanted to hurt your sister.", "Well done you ruined the party and the family. Your cousin definitely needed to know about it and so did your parents. Your sister still has more secrets make sure you let her know that you know what's she's been doing", "YTA. Your intentions were shitty. This wasn't about doing the right thing, you just wanted to get back at your sister. You didn't give a fuck about how your cousin or sister's husband might feel having to find this out like that. No privacy for then all because you wanted some attention.", "ESH\n\nYes, your sister is an AH for the affair.\n\nBut if you gave a damn about your cousin, you would have talked to her in private, preparing her for a bombshell to be dropped beforehand. Instead, you completely humiliated her by telling her that her marriage was over in front of an entire crowd of people, at an event that was supposed to be a happy occasion. This was not about your cousin. This was about you being bitten by the jealousy bug over your sister.\n\nI hope you getting to one-up your sister was worth your cousin's total humiliation.", "Yep.

You had absolutely no regard for your cousin or anyone else\u2019s feelings. You are just as gross as your sister.", "YTA.\n\nGood job for utterly fucking over your cousin by exposing this in this way for your own personal edification and amusement, I guess.\n\nIf you actually cared about 'your cousin being deceived,' you'd have informed her privately.\n\nBut nope, you were just looking to drop a big steaming shit on the table and watch everybody's reaction.", "The cousin's pain is obviously the worst part of this ... but also consider the people who had to travel in for this. They're seeing family members they haven't seen in years, they had to pay for plane tickets and hotels, maybe used up some of their limited PTO, and they were looking forward to a good time catching up ... then one asshole cousin decides partway through dinner to expose another asshole cousin's affair with yet another poor cousin's husband and the whole thing descends into shouting and chaos. Were there kids present at this reunion? Did they 'deserve to know' the details of this affair? (Bonus asshole points if there were kids there who had to watch while their parents marriage dissolved publicly in front of the whole family). Were there any elderly relatives there for whom this might be the last full family reunion they'll get to attend?

I bet this scenario has played out at multiple family reunions lol. And no I\u2019m not joking.", "The cousin being cheated on herself does not deserve the humiliation of being informed in public like that.", "You don't see how comoletely uncontrollable events  and saying something to cause drama are totally different?", "I think in all of this the cousin was punished the most, not OP.", "There was nothing stopping Op from revealing the truth in private. Op's desire to one-up his sister overruled anyone else's feelings. So, yes. YTA, Op.", "This will be spoken about for decades.", "exactly. If the cousin decided to tell everyone at that moment that her husband had been cheating on her, fine, but to just blow up her life in front of her entire family? Unbelievably selfish on the part of the OP.", "I feel bad for the cousin but not this sister."]}
