{"id": 21211, "submission_id": "14pdwg0", "title": "AITA for wanting people to wear white at my wedding?", "selftext": "So I'm (24F) having a hard time seeing where I went wrong, but me and my husband to be (26M) both struggle with NPD so I figured an outside opinion might be helpful, since neither of us tends to understand when we're wrong right away. \n\n\r  \nI'm getting married (yay!) in December to the absolute love of my life, and we both want it to be the most spectacular wedding the world has ever seen because we both really love attention. I never used to feel comfortable admitting that, but ever since I've been with him I've been able to really accept that, and it's made my life so much more \\*fun.\\* We decided that instead of having me in a white dress like all the other white dresses, and him in the same tuxedo as every man in attendance, it would look really spectacular if we both dressed head to toe in gold. What we want is for all our guests to wear either black, white, or grey, and for us to be the only ones wearing color. I figured that not only would I look like a princess, but I'd also be dancing with a prince instead of just some guy, and he's so into the idea that he remembers it as being his. We just love that idea of a sea of monochrome, and then us in the middle of it all. \n\n\r  \nThe only thing is, my sister (26F) has been absolutely furious at us ever since the clothing requirements came out. First, she said this was \"proof that I never changed\" and I was being controlling again. Basically, that asking guests to wear a specific color was insane. Then she started making digs about my hair and how I was \"just doing this to show off\" and asked if I planned to have her dye her hair too (I did not, we're both blonde but mine is a bit more yellow-blonde, and my husband is dying his hair for the wedding). I admitted to that, but also pointed out that it's my wedding and it's normal. Then she accused me of trying to upstage everyone else's wedding dress, basically implying that I was trying to get everyone to show up in wedding dresses so I could compete with them and make myself look even better by comparison. \n\n\r  \nThis was not ever the plan. When I mentioned what she said to my husband to be, his eyes kind of lit up in this really cute way and he said we should encourage people to actually wear their own wedding clothes, but we decided it would probably be actually terrible of us. We decided to let our families wear copper if they wanted, so they would stand out as a nice accent to gold, and then my sister would also get to stand out. I was totally willing to pay, and said as much. That was when she called me a spoiled child, and said she wasn't like me and wasn't in this for herself, and wanted all the guests to be able to wear \"normal wedding clothes\" and that nobody in their right mind would be comfortable wearing white to a wedding. \n\n\r  \nTL;DR: I want all my guests to wear black, white, or grey to my wedding, and my husband and I to wear gold. My sister thinks this is horrible and I'm making everyone feel uncomfortable. AITA?

I don't know of anyone that doesn't have clothing in these colors.", "NTA. Plenty of weddings have dress codes, nothing new. If she doesn\u2019t want to follow the dress code, she doesn\u2019t have to go.", "NTA --- I hear all the time about bridezillas making outlandish requests as to what guests can or can't wear to their wedding. As its YOUR wedding and not her's why does she even think she gets a say about what and how you do your wedding, and as for the let everybody wear their own wedding clothes, I read another post here about a soon-to-be MIL that wanted to upstage the bride and her and the groom's sisters were all going to wear the exact same dress as the bride. anyway, the bride found out so when the invites went out everybody was told except the mother/sister to wear their own wedding dress, day of the wedding they turned up in what they thought was going to be the same dress as the bride only to find that the bride not only had a different colour dress but at least half of the guests were all in wedding dress's she said that everyone had a blast except. She had a fantastic day, YOUR wedding you do it YOUR way.", "NTA - What is wrong with your sister?! \n\nOff course the ones getting married upstage everyone else at their wedding. It is actually the whole point of the event ffs. This have nothing to do with your sister.\nAnd yeah obviously every bride want to look their best. Nothing wrong with wanting the prettiest wedding dress. I\u2019m envisioning you with the sun coloured dress of donkey skin, and it\u2019s gorgeous. \nIt is about every one showing off their support towards the ones getting married. There no question about who is the center of attention for that day -and it isn\u2019t about the sister of the bride. \n\nIt\u2019s nice you and futur hubby are agreeing on the aesthetics of the weeding. Your sister opinion is irrelevant at best. Your wedding isn\u2019t about her at all. Her wants don\u2019t matter on the subject. It doesn\u2019t concern her. She is getting invited not summoned. If she have issues with the setting, she can voice it, however her wants really don\u2019t matter. \n\nYou aren\u2019t abusing control over what people will wear by giving a colour scheme. Far from insane to ask your guests to pick from black to white. It\u2019s already sad and infuriating, you gave up an important part of what will make it your dream day, allowing to copper colour to appease you entitled sister. \n\nHer wants to stand out, is only confirmation how much of an attention seeker she is. And her use of DARVO to bully into her wants is disgusting and infuriating. \n\nAgain YOUR wedding is NOT about her. \n\nAgain your fiance and yourself are the ones deciding how YOU want the day to be. \nShe get invited, she doesn\u2019t have to go if she is so irritated by the day not being about her. Her coming or not is a her issue. Her presence isn\u2019t required for the event to happen. \n\nHow much more are you willing to give up to appease your entitled attention seeking sister at your own wedding?", "I actually think your dress code is not only reasonable but makes life easier for the guests. I would think that most people have something black in their wardrobe and probably grey or white as well. So it's unlikely that people are going to have to buy anything special. I wonder if your sister is just kicking back because you're not having a traditional wedding and she's jealous of the attention you'll receive?", "NTA\n\nNothing your sister said seems reasonable. I don\u2019t know what her (real) problem is. It\u2019s not controlling it\u2019s like a theme party. You pay - you choose the theme. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. \nIs she jealous?", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like a really pretty wedding. I don't think upstaging everyone who has ever had a wedding is the goal here, but I also think every person who has a wedding wants it to be special and memorable in their own way. Kinda weird your sister doesn't feel that way.", "Nta a lot of weeding have dress code. And colour you choose is easy to find and it can wear to other party too. Maybe you sister jealous of you or something.", "NTA. It's your wedding, so you get to choose the theme, and this is by far not the craziest (clothing) requirement I've heard for a wedding. They even get to choose between 3 colors, I'm sure everyone will find an outfit they like. \n\nAnd btw: I think the idea is awesome, very original but not over the top crazy. Do your thing!", "NTA\nit's your wedding. Your special day. Not wanting to wear white ( which is common ) is nothing wrong / crime.\nUsually guests don't wear white to wedding, bc the bride only wears. ( this is also dress code)\n \n\nThese days there are lot of dress code weddings. \nYou're not the only one. \n\n\nWear colourful and be a princess or queen. \nBe you \n\nBesides both you and your husband, are okay with it.", "NTA. OP, I have to say you were very sly in how you wrote your post by mentioning both you and your fianc\u00e9e have NPD - Narcissistic Personality Disorder. It\u2019s clear almost no one who has responded so far understood what that meant, or at least glossed over it. My guess is that in all other aspects of life, you have been exhausting to be around because everything always needs to be about you (my guess is the same for your fianc\u00e9e?). However, In this case, your wedding, the desire/need for attention is totally appropriate and your request is absolutely not a challenge for your attendees. What woman doesn\u2019t have a little black dress? Or, if you did tell women they could wear their wedding dresses to get more mileage out of them, I am sure some would take you up on the offer. Your wedding sounds like it will be fun, if not a bit over the top and something most will likely talk about for a while if you pull it off. Maybe you should simply tell your sister that she isn\u2019t required to attend if she would be miserable. That you care about her (you mention in comments that she is lovely) and that nothing you are doing is meant to be a dig or to hurt her and wonder if she would be happier if you explicit let her know that you won\u2019t be offended if she doesn\u2019t attend. But, your wedding, your rules, your dress code.", "NTA for wanting a dress code - it sounds like your sister is so used to you claiming the limelight, that she\u2019s really struggling to accept this moment is 100% about you and your fianc\u00e9! And that\u2019s exactly what it should be. I reckon if she doesn\u2019t want to celebrate you both, then she doesn\u2019t have to attend.", "Your sister seems stressful to be sisters with. That was a reasonable request and it seems like she\u2019s projecting \n\nNTA", "YTA. You're pushing into the realm of bridezillahood.  It's acceptable for a bride and groom to have a dress code for the wedding party. It allows the happy couple to be the center of attention; and the pictures do come out looking a lot better.\n\nBut to tell every single guest that they have to wear a certain color is a bit much. If you continue with this demand, be prepared for many of your guests to send their regrets.", "NTA. If a dress code is your only request for your guest, I dont see any problem here.\nYou asked only for a specific color. You didnt ask for a specific stlye nor for specific hairstyle, haircolor or makeup.\nFrom your post and your comments it seem your sister is  jealous, and fear that your wedding would be more loved than hers.\nAlso, you are so kind to want her at your wedding, when she didnt invite you to hers....\nCan i ask why you had been excluded from her wedding?", "Maybe your sister wanted to buy an extravagant dress to have all the spotlight on her and making her wearing something without color make her mad because she wont be \"seen\" as much as see wanted to.\n\nI would love to be able to were black to a wedding and as long as you don't force all the guests to wear only white but give some choices, you are NTA !\n\nIt is YOUR wedding, she can have all the other days to \"stand out\", YOU get to stand out for once !", "YTA. It's one thing to dictate what color your wedding party is wearing because they accepted those terms when agreeing to be in it, but it's very rude to force your guests to wear certain colors.", "You absolutely are a selfish and self-centered Ahole.\n\nIf you want people to wear specific colors to your wedding, then you should buy it for them. And even then  if they don't want to wear it, they shouldn't  have to. \n\nThere is more to life than isntagran photos, and having people dress a certain way does not make the day any more special or meaningful\n In fact, your behavior detracts from the meaningfulness of the day by focusing on some material aspect of it, rather than the spiritual and social bonding ritual that it represents.", "NTA. If you want your guests to wear certain colors so YOU can stand out at YOUR wedding, implement the dress code. This is not the first nor only wedding with a dress code. You even told your family that they could wear copper to stand out more and she was still not pleased. You are being completely reasonable with your dress code request, I don\u2019t understand what she is angry about.", "NTA, she claims to not doing it for herself but others, but if that was true should would agree to the dress code for you. I don't know much about wedding but I don't find it bad to have a dress code.", "NTA. I probably wouldn't go, I don't own anything remotely suitable for a wedding in black grey or white.  and wouldn't want to buy something I'd never wear again. But it's your wedding, you do you.", "NTA. Your sister seems to be responding to some past traumas with her comments here. The vast majority of wedding have a dress code. Many, many weddings have a specific color-themed dress code. And your guests don\u2019t have to wear white\u2014they can wear grey or black as well. Who doesn\u2019t have a black dress they can wear??\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding. It\u2019s all about the two of you. I appreciate the instinct to not have people show up in their wedding attire for the purposes of \u201cupstaging\u201d them, but tbh I cannot imagine someone saying, \u201cI need to wear white to this wedding I GUESS I WILL WEAR MY WEDDING DRESS,\u201d so I\u2019m genuinely unsure what your sis is on about.", "Are you making your Fiance dye his hair blonde so he can match you? Is his natural hair color not good enough? Honestly it sounds like your sister has been forced to watch you take and hog every millisecond of attention growing up while she got no attention. Did you even let he get left over scrabs of attention? It sounds like you want all of your guests to look and feel as ugly as possible, just. Just so you and your fiance strut around decked out in gold. Why not just choose a gold wedding dress and suit? Because not a lot of formal clothes look nice in your color scheme for your guests. Your wedding your choice but be prepared for her not to come and support you.", "YTA. \n\nA wedding should be about enjoying the company of your family and friends as they help you celebrate.  \n\nNot dictating that they throw money away on buying clothes they\u2019ll probably never wear again.", "It's your wedding so your rules. If people don't like it they can not come. NTA", "NTA. Are you sure you have NPD and aren\u2019t just the family scapegoat? Sounds like your sister is more of a narcissist than you are. It\u2019s your wedding and you are being more than accommodating to your guests by allowing white, grays, black, and now copper. It\u2019s actually very common to have a black and white wedding. This is not a narcissistic choice. Your wedding, your way. Period. End of Story.\n\nSide note: asking your guests to wear their own wedding dresses would be an unacceptable ask, but you recognized that and didn\u2019t turn that thought into a reality.

To be clear, I really don\u2019t think you are in the wrong here and I didn\u2019t mean to imply that you knowingly meant to deceive in your original post.

I can offer some insights, but realizing the situation is sticky- please tread softly and gently. It sounds like you sister is still in a lot of pain, and did does sound like your sister needs more therapy. Likely, more therapy together would help. Most importantly- are you in individual therapy for your NPD? If not- please, consider it. Therapy isn\u2019t a \u201cone and done\u201d it\u2019s an process that is on going as needed. As needed being the key portions and sounds like as of lately: it\u2019s needed. AITA isn\u2019t a replacement for therapy. \n\nYour sister is definitely reacting through a place of emotional trauma and while it\u2019s not your responsibility to circumvent her emotional reactions- you do have to opportunity in helping her heal moving forward. \u201cNothing can change what I\u2019ve done, but I can try to build a better relationship for us moving forward. I need you to help me to do that- if that\u2019s something you want.\u201d \n\nWhat have her \u201cterms\u201d been and are they terms or are they boundaries? Boundaries being respected is one thing- building new and positive experiences together while respecting those boundaries is where the next step of healing lies if a happy relationship (to any degree of intimacy) is wanted. The best way (in my opinion) would be to ask what she would like you to do to show that. That said, have you ever tried going out of your way to make a day just the two of you where it\u2019s all about her? It sounds like you\u2019re banned from events of hers (understandably) but what about offering to create opportunities where you can show her that you care about her? Likely, she won\u2019t be open to that being just the two of you- and even better! Having mom or her partner there while you and any +1\u2019s denote the day to making her feel special could be really positive. That is: if you can manage taking the spotlight off yourself. If not, again, consider more individual therapy for yourself. I love that you\u2019re embracing your own love for attention from a place of self love- but it cannot mean that you never forfeit the spotlight to anyone else. Which means, not using this an an opportunity to turn around and go, \u201csee what an amazing sister I am for tying to help you heal through the trauma I put you through!\u201d \n\nAgain, these are just ideas that you can bring to your sister (potentially with a therapist) to attempt healing- but the intricacies of a intersibling relationship where one (or both?) parties have NPD is miles above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. That said, I\u2019d consider hoping over to some of the NPD subreddits asking for their advice. Fair warning, they\u2019re not always the kindest to those with the disorder, but as they\u2019re frequented by narc victims, they will have some important insights. I\u2019m sure there are some victims who have siblings with NPD that have a list of dreams that they wish their narc siblings would do so they could have a healthy relationship. While, again, not a replacement for therapy- I have found them to be a healing resource for both victims and those with NPD.", "I guess it depends on culture.

You're 100% correct that I was an AH while we were growing up, and I did steal attention at her birthdays, and other events that should have been hers. At the time, I didn't know it was wrong. I thought she liked seeing me perform, and it wasn't until later that I understood that I was taking something away instead of giving it. We went to therapy together after she didn't talk to me much for two years, and I've apologized more times than I can count, and tried very hard to be better since then.", "I really want her to come... but I think you're right that we've done everything we reasonably can to accommodate her.", "I mean, I don't see it that way, but I'm obviously biased. It's more like... whenever everyone is paying attention to me, I just feel so, so happy, and it's like the best feeling in the world, and sometimes when nobody pays attention I feel... it's just horrible? It's like I feel like I only exist if someone is watching. When I'm alone, I barely even have any feelings. It's just all dull and meaningless. But yeah, it did accumulate in me stealing the spotlight when I shouldn't have. I thought, at the time, that what I was doing was good, because it *felt* right, and a lot of people really do love watching me perform. It didn't occur to me that I was taking something away from my sister. We did go to therapy when I was 18, which is when she put a lot of her boundaries in place.", "This. I feel like no one else understood. I only fully understood bc of the way OP was responding. Not typical of someone who can feel the normal range of emotions. She seems to be saying the right things to get empathy and not being angered when she should (like her sister not inviting her to her wedding).", "I'm in therapy! It's been a little tricky to have it be as consistent as I would like, but for now I am in every other week. I know I'll always be a narcissist, no matter what I do, and I want to still be able to have good relationships where I don't hurt or take things away from anyone. I've said something very similar to what you quoted a few times. \n\nHer boundaries are pretty simple. We only really meet up at either family gatherings, or one-on-one in a private space. If we meet one-on-one, I'm not allowed to talk about myself, my life, or anything I'm accomplishing or working on unless she specifically asks. At family events she'll be at, I need to send her what I'll be wearing ahead of time and have it be non-attention-seeking, and I can't perform (sing, dance, etc) or talk about anything I'm working on unless I ask her permission first, and if she says no I can't ask again. If she tells me she needs to vent, then I can't react or get upset about anything she says to me or tell anyone else about it. That's pretty much everything. It can be tricky at times, but I know that's mostly my disorder, and it's worth it to have her in my life. \n\nDo you have any subreddits you'd recommend?", "Thank you!", "Have you apologise and recognised wrong doing from your part during your childhood?\n\nIncluding her doesn\u2019t have to include making your wedding about her.

It is about the both of you, it is about your relationship together, not about your sister feud and setting the record for childhood past. \n\nAre you opposed about guests wearing white wedding dresses? \nIf you allow your bridesmaids to do so, they will stand out without clashing the colour background you are aiming for. \nI personally like the idea of married ones being able to wear their wedding dress again when the bride choose an other color to stand out, or the one unmarried (for whatever reason) to experience wearing one. Like princess around the queen. \nBtw her comment about you wanting to upstage other at your own wedding is so ridiculous. The one about you wanting to shame others by being the center of attention and stand out at your wedding is quite telling about her own wicked mentality.", "How do we know you\u2019re not manipulating us?

I wouldn't actually have a problem with anyone wearing a white wedding dress! I think that would look absolutely gorgeous, and I would love it!", "That would make my life a lot more convenient if it were true! More boring though. \n\nIn all seriousness, that idea does come from something real, but it's not exactly what you think. It's more like... if I don't get attention for a certain amount of time, my emotions get sort of locked off. It's like everything becomes really empty and meaningless, and it's one of the worst feelings in the whole world. But, I don't usually get like that anymore, mostly thanks to my husband-to-be, who is happy to give me lots of attention, and I'm happy to do the same for him!", "Why not?", "I would never want to ruin the day for my husband, I love him more than I've ever loved anyone, but I love my sister too. It will feel wrong if she isn't there. \n\nWhat boundaries do you think are unreasonable? I've talked about them all with her and her therapist when they were put in place, and they both explained to me that it was what she needed to feel comfortable having me in her life. I love her, and I want to be in her life.", "Thanks!", "Is she married and couldn\u2019t have her dream wedding day or could she have an issue with you getting married first?

From what you\u2019ve described, definitely NTA. It\u2019s your wedding day and that\u2019s the one time at least where you should get the spotlight.

It feels like your sister is keeping you in her life so she can continuously punish you for your behavior *as a child.*", "OP herself in comments admits her sister is justified in being upset with her and that her sister has strict boundaries with her. OP isn't even allowed to attend her sister's events. That seems like an asshole comment to me. I hadn't read the comments when I posted that or I would have been harsher on OP.", "what\u2019s awesome is your recognition. my ex was psychologically abusive because she was a covert narcissist, but refused any type of therapy and didn\u2019t think she needed to work on anything. the fact that you recognize it alone is incredible and i\u2019m really proud of you. \n\ni have a similar need for attention but mine comes from childhood trauma, and yeah, having a partner that recognizes that and WANTS to help with that is incredible. i\u2019m glad you have each other.\n\ni\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware but you may always have issues like this with family due to the past. i don\u2019t know what details are in your past, but i had a toxic family environment yet we are healing because we are all doing the work needed to repair and make sure it\u2019s all love. what matters is that you are committed to making progress and amends. i hope your wedding is beautiful!!!", "Admitting her sister is treating her badly under the guise of bOuNdAriEs is an asshole thing for OP to do how, exactly?", "NTA. It's not as though you demanded everyone invest in a clown suit for your wedding (and even then, people could just not go if they didn't like it). It seems like your sister has an issue with you openly liking attention as you say yourself, and which is not necessarily a bad thing for you to like, as you read like a sweet-natured person getting attention in an appropriate way, and is projecting her dislike of that into wedding etiquette. It's fine to want to stand out on your wedding day, and fine to ask people to wear muted colours to help you do it.", "Wow, I have never seen that many awards on one post. It deserves all of them, but dayum", "I have thought about that a lot in the past 8 years. Before that, I honestly thought that she didn't really like attention, especially not like I did. Main girls in books didn't like attention like I did, same on TV, most of my friends got things like stage fright or nerves talking to strangers that I never did. In my head, this was just how I was, and it seemed less than common.", "The fact that she expects you to get her permission for your clothes, what you talk about, etc. is completely inappropriate.", "I know.", "Was the TV series *Victorious*?  Not the point at all, I'm just curious, especially given your age.  :)", "Talking about your goals and accomplishments with family is normal. Your sister is treating you really poorly.", "NTA, this seems like such an innocuous and probably easy request, as another poster stated most men have a black or grey suit, and what women does not have the classic Little Black Dress?", "NTA!!! Your plans sounds beautiful and super fun! Lots of people do dress codes for their weddings. Your sister sounds jealous.", "NTA but have you spoken to a photographer? Winter light, probably indoors, gonna need a flash, head to toe metallics... In person it's pure fantasy and I love it, but is it gonna photograph well? I ask because I want this to work for you cos it's just the right amount of crazy to be genius :)", "NTA.\n\nIt's a wedding. It's one of those times when *everyone* develops NPD, at least for one day. You might ask some of the guests if they think it's OK. I wouldn't take your sister's advice on anything; she obviously has it in for you.", "My cousin asked their guests to wear black and white to their wedding as well and literally nobody had an issue with it. It was fun to see how everyone fit into the dress code. NTA!", "NTA. There is absolutely nothing wrong in a dresscode, so yours just being a bit different than usual should not be an issue st all.\n\nCalling it now, your sister just loves the drama and probably had some differently colored dress she wanted to wear... but it's neither her wedding, nor her choice. Also no reason whatsoever to go off on you like this. I think your wedding idea sounds amazing and unique!", "NTA and it's weird she'd get her knickers so twisted about this. What are the odds she planned to show up in a wedding dress/white dress to steal the spotlight and you ruined it for her?", "Sooooo\u2026\n\nYou, an admitted narcissist, marrying an admitted narcissist, want a spectacular wedding of your dreams, and your guests must accommodate you by wearing (possibly having to purchase, and oh, I\u2019m guessing your registry is pretty demanding) clothing that you specify.\n\nYou literally referred to yourself as a princess.\n\nYour sister is right. And yes. You are AH.", "Yta", "Lol, the sister sounds like the exhausting one? OP Admits she and her fiance both have narcissistic personality disorder, and that she spent most of her life trying to steal the attention off everyone around her. Chances are OP was pretty unpleasant and insufferable in the past.", "Portal to a hell dimension?", "She has her reasons, I don't blame her. I just wanted to know if I was out of line here.", "Thank you! I'm so excited about my dress honestly. I just love it!!", "Actually they can choose between black, white, and grey.", "One of my husband-to-be and my friends is a professional influencer who offered to do the photography as our wedding gift, and thinks it's going to look amazing!", "She is probably still processing her trauma. Your wedding is an event surrounded by fuss and planning and splendor and you and your groom of course being in the spotlight. All absolutely appropriate of you, and probably extremely triggering to her.\n\nThat's not to say that she gets to dictate your wedding. Honestly your theme sounds gorgeous and I don't think you're asking too much of your guests. But that doesn't magically take away her trauma response. Sucks for both of you. Have the wedding you and your groom dream of, but understand that she may be coming from a place where her trauma probably feels very fresh once more and that she's probably lashing out due to the pain of that.", "Attention is supposed to be on you for your wedding.", "And she\u2019s spent time working on herself and going to therapy. This is her wedding. The one day that really is all about her. Her acknowledging her past mistakes is a lot more than the typical narcissist does", "So then what are the reasons? It\u2019s your wedding not hers. If she doesn\u2019t want to respect your decisions she shouldn\u2019t be there point blank period. There is no reason that someone should be mad because of color like WHAT. Does that not sound insane to you. She can wear black, white or grey \u201cnormal\u201d outfit colors other then the white. There is no reason for disrespecting a bride and out of all things color.", "If she\u2019s that concerned tell her she can pay for everything and then you\u2019ll listen. I can\u2019t think of a reason on being mad over color", "I remember reading that!  One of the best petty revenges I\u2019ve ever seen!  I wish I was there to witness it lol", "Thank you so much! I'm sorry your ex hurt you, that must have been horrible.", "I understand. I wish I could change what I did, and it sucks that it's ended up so... bad. I feel like I'm just never going to be able to be good again sometimes, and I know it's my own fault but I wish I could fix it.", "I was not invited to her wedding.", "I have a personality disorder. I'll never not be a narcissist, so I get why she's strict with her boundaries.", "They were Hindu, I believe as the bride wearing red in China is traditional. Wearing red to that wedding you meant seemed to mean you had slept with the groom! So...perfect if it's the bride doing so ;D", "It\u2019s the truth, though. How you behaved as a kid doesn\u2019t justify how she\u2019s behaving as an adult.", "In this instance since OP SHOULD be the center of attention -sister is kind of being an AH by still not wanting the event (OP'S WEDDING) to be attention on OP.", "Right, but that should remind her that she was the center of attention at her wedding. Which is why she needs to shut up and stop trying to make you feel bad about being the center of attention at yours.", "It sounds like you are behaving fine now \u2014 you\u2019ve learned when and how it is and isn\u2019t okay to act on your attention-seeking tendencies; but your sister is still hurting from years ago and isn\u2019t over your history. Can you acknowledge this to her? \n\nAlso did you ever apologize for what it was like for her in the past having a sibling who used to steal the spotlight from her?", "I did apologize, more times than I can count. Our relationship is fully on her terms, and we went to therapy together when I was 18. I accept that I sucked back then and I've worked really hard to get where I am today, but I know she might never forgive me.", "It just makes her more comfortable.", "Then it sounds like you\u2019re doing the best you can and this is about her own issues. Does she have NPD or something too?", "It was!", "It makes her more comfortable being at events with me there, and I'd rather be quiet than not invited again.", "NTA\n\n\"Black, white, or grey\" is downright reasonable.  Most of my day-to-day clothing fits that description fine.  It's not a difficult expectation to meet.  This is your day, and your husband's day.  It's reasonable to be a little more controlling than you could get away with normally.\n\nAnd your sister seems to be strategically misreading things.  There is no reasoning with someone, who refuses to hear what you say.", "Just tell the guests not to wear gold. \nOr yellow. But you would prefer them to wear black or white.", "If she's not comfortable wearing white to a wedding, she has two whole other colours to choose from. It's not like you said white and only white. A dress code isn't that unusual. Your sister seems to want to cause drama for drama's sake. NTA", "NTA. \n\nOne of my favorite weddings ever was an \u201call white\u201d dress code. We all wore white and the couple wore color. Photos were amazing and it was such a beautiful experience. I also got to rewear my reception dress and it felt so special to celebrate their love and remember our special day.\n\nAs to \u201cupstaging\u201d or \u201ccompeting\u201d with other people and their wedding dresses, that\u2019s so silly. Looking good is not a competition or a zero sum game. Because you look amazing doesn\u2019t mean anyone else looks worse. Why can\u2019t everyone shine!?\n\nI hope you have the best day and feel celebrated!", "NTA, and I love your self awareness and openness to asking questions and receiving genuine responses. My husband struggles with NPD so I get where you\u2019re coming from. \n\nIn this instance though, you\u2019re not wrong for wanting to be the center of attention. You\u2019re not wrong for wanting to stand out, because that\u2019s the entire point of your own wedding. You can set your dress code to whatever you want, if people don\u2019t want to attend and abide by it, they don\u2019t have to! Everyone has white, black, or grey clothes, or can easily get them. This isn\u2019t a hard ask. \n\nIt sounds like your sister has some resentment probably due to past behavior she\u2019s experienced from you and it\u2019s affecting her judgement on this.", "NTA and i don\u2019t see anything wrong with letting people know they can wear their own wedding clothes if they like, either. It\u2019s your wedding, you\u2019re giving people options, your sister is acting insane.", "NTA. It sounds like a great idea. Everybody has those colors so it makes it easy for people.", "NTA when my Aunt got married every guest was asked to wear white, the bride wore a black dress and the bridal party wore red and black. It was beautiful.", "NTA your sister sounds like she's harboring resentment towards you that has nothing to do with the wedding, and she would find fault no matter what you do. Not everyone does it, but it's not uncommon to have a dress code or to ask guests to wear specific colors, within reason. Giving three color choices isn't terrible. As far as the comment about \"showing off\" ....you're meant to stand out amongst the guests at your own wedding. There's tons of decorum surrounding not upstaging the bride, so you wanting to stand out is hardly revolutionary.", "Seconding your comment. I wore blue and the bridesmaids were in white. Can confirm, world did not end.\n\nAlso, any who didn't have one in white didn't necessarily need to buy one either; one or two borrowed from other people. I'd imagine it wouldn't be hard to borrow a dress in the right colors for your wedding given that many color options if it was a money issue.", "We don't actually have a registry, and I sort of assume everyone has something in black at least, for funerals. We did offer to pay for my sister's dress.", "Low. The odds are extremely low. She wouldn't do that sort of thing.", "Thank you so much!", "Thank you for your advice. It's really wonderful hearing from someone who understands.", "Have you never been to a \u201cWhite Party\u201d where everyone dresses in all white, or other color themed event? They are quite common. For instance, in Indianapolis, black & white ones are traditional for the month of May.", "That is very unsurprising based on the comments she made. Several things she said stood out to me as jealousy, and the comment about \"upstaging other people's weddings\" immediately made me think she was unhappy about her own", "I have nothing to say. Your post was manipulative af.\n\n\u201c", "That's the most important part of the dress!", "Of course! A lot of people don\u2019t understand that NPD is hard to deal with, both for the people around them *and* the person with the disorder. It\u2019s not easy to not be able to trust yourself and your judgement. \n\nYou seem like you\u2019re managing great though, and you\u2019re doing a fantastic job of realizing when something is probably too much (asking everyone to wear their wedding attire) and when you might actually have a point (simply setting your own reasonable dress code). \n\nHave the wedding of your dreams!! I wish you and your fianc\u00e9 the best both in your marriage and your treatments. <3", "No, I never have been to (or heard of) a White Party and I think a costume party is different than a wedding, anyway. Treating your wedding guests as if they are props in your design aesthetic is not OK, imo. You go to a White Party or a costume party because you want to be part of the theme, you go to a wedding to celebrate a union. OP sounds really obnoxious.", "Yeah, if she was asking everyone to wear either royal purple, kelly green, or periwinkle blue, yeah, that would be weird and controlling. But asking people to wear black, white, or grey? Total non-issue, even I have a black dress and I hardly ever wear dresses.", "I'm a psych clinician,  and while I commend OP for her self-awareness,  true narcissists cannot change. They can learn to act in more of a socially acceptable manner/play be the rules. However, that innate selfishness and feelings of self-importance cannot be therapied, medicated, etc. out of a person. Just as someone with true ASPD cannot every truly learn empathy.\n\nDoing more than a typical narcissist does, doesn't erase any of her past actions. And unfortunately,  people are judged, by those they have hurt, for past actions. Honestly,  the sister will likely never forgive or like OP. The sister needs to work on her own resentfulness and anger. They should probably be LC, OP will never not be a narcissist and it doesn't seem as though the sister will be open to any changes OP has worked towards.", "I'm sorry, I've tried to be as up front about what's going on as I can.", "When we were growing up, I stole attention from her on many occasions. As a result, I haven't been invited to any of her special events since I was sixteen. She has trauma from growing up and having me steal the spotlight.", "It seems opinion is divided.\n\nBut I agree with you - it doesnt seem that much of a burden.", "I think you should apologize again but also state that your wedding is not the right time and place to bring that issue up again. This special day is always about bride and groom. No matter the background. She is obviously not done with this topic. But you can talk about this unrelated to your wedding.", "You truly don\u2019t get it.\n\n\u201cI have NPD.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love it when I am the center of attention!\u201d\n\nDo you get how much you are letting your wedding dial into your disorder? Healthiest choice for you - small wedding.\n\nBut then, you won\u2019t get to be a \u201cprincess.\u201d\n\nsmdh", "I get it but it\u2019s normally what children and even teens do that wasn\u2019t your fault. The adults in your life should have made sure everyone felt loved/heard. I want you to understand that\u2019s not your fault or responsibility that was the adults. She also needs to understand not everything is going to be about her ESPECIALLY your wedding. Don\u2019t feel guilt for adults not knowing how to take care of multiple children. They can still be good parents not saying their not but sometimes it\u2019s like that.", "Maybe you should try therapy together. Or have a party beforehand and make her feel loved. It could be other feelings like losing her sister. Not that\u2019s she\u2019s losing you but sometimes it\u2019s how people feel.", "Thank you.", "No, she just has trauma from how I behaved when we were growing up. I don't blame her for that."]}
