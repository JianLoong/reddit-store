I never used to feel comfortable admitting that, but ever since I've been with him I've been able to really accept that, and it's made my life so much more \\*fun.\\* We decided that instead of having me in a white dress like all the other white dresses, and him in the same tuxedo as every man in attendance, it would look really spectacular if we both dressed head to toe in gold. What we want is for all our guests to wear either black, white, or grey, and for us to be the only ones wearing color. I figured that not only would I look like a princess, but I'd also be dancing with a prince instead of just some guy, and he's so into the idea that he remembers it as being his. We just love that idea of a sea of monochrome, and then us in the middle of it all. \n\n\r  \nThe only thing is, my sister (26F) has been absolutely furious at us ever since the clothing requirements came out. First, she said this was \"proof that I never changed\" and I was being controlling again. Basically, that asking guests to wear a specific color was insane. Then she started making digs about my hair and how I was \"just doing this to show off\" and asked if I planned to have her dye her hair too (I did not, we're both blonde but mine is a bit more yellow-blonde, and my husband is dying his hair for the wedding). I admitted to that, but also pointed out that it's my wedding and it's normal. Then she accused me of trying to upstage everyone else's wedding dress, basically implying that I was trying to get everyone to show up in wedding dresses so I could compete with them and make myself look even better by comparison. \n\n\r  \nThis was not ever the plan. When I mentioned what she said to my husband to be, his eyes kind of lit up in this really cute way and he said we should encourage people to actually wear their own wedding clothes, but we decided it would probably be actually terrible of us. We decided to let our families wear copper if they wanted, so they would stand out as a nice accent to gold, and then my sister would also get to stand out. I was totally willing to pay, and said as much. That was when she called me a spoiled child, and said she wasn't like me and wasn't in this for herself, and wanted all the guests to be able to wear \"normal wedding clothes\" and that nobody in their right mind would be comfortable wearing white to a wedding. \n\n\r  \nTL;DR: I want all my guests to wear black, white, or grey to my wedding, and my husband and I to wear gold. My sister thinks this is horrible and I'm making everyone feel uncomfortable. AITA?

I don't know of anyone that doesn't have clothing in these colors.", "NTA. Plenty of weddings have dress codes, nothing new. If she doesn\u2019t want to follow the dress code, she doesn\u2019t have to go.", "NTA --- I hear all the time about bridezillas making outlandish requests as to what guests can or can't wear to their wedding. As its YOUR wedding and not her's why does she even think she gets a say about what and how you do your wedding, and as for the let everybody wear their own wedding clothes, I read another post here about a soon-to-be MIL that wanted to upstage the bride and her and the groom's sisters were all going to wear the exact same dress as the bride. anyway, the bride found out so when the invites went out everybody was told except the mother/sister to wear their own wedding dress, day of the wedding they turned up in what they thought was going to be the same dress as the bride only to find that the bride not only had a different colour dress but at least half of the guests were all in wedding dress's she said that everyone had a blast except. She had a fantastic day, YOUR wedding you do it YOUR way.", "NTA - What is wrong with your sister?! \n\nOff course the ones getting married upstage everyone else at their wedding. It is actually the whole point of the event ffs. This have nothing to do with your sister.\nAnd yeah obviously every bride want to look their best. Nothing wrong with wanting the prettiest wedding dress. I\u2019m envisioning you with the sun coloured dress of donkey skin, and it\u2019s gorgeous. \nIt is about every one showing off their support towards the ones getting married. There no question about who is the center of attention for that day -and it isn\u2019t about the sister of the bride. \n\nIt\u2019s nice you and futur hubby are agreeing on the aesthetics of the weeding. Your sister opinion is irrelevant at best. Your wedding isn\u2019t about her at all. Her wants don\u2019t matter on the subject. It doesn\u2019t concern her. She is getting invited not summoned. If she have issues with the setting, she can voice it, however her wants really don\u2019t matter. \n\nYou aren\u2019t abusing control over what people will wear by giving a colour scheme. Far from insane to ask your guests to pick from black to white. It\u2019s already sad and infuriating, you gave up an important part of what will make it your dream day, allowing to copper colour to appease you entitled sister. \n\nHer wants to stand out, is only confirmation how much of an attention seeker she is. And her use of DARVO to bully into her wants is disgusting and infuriating. \n\nAgain YOUR wedding is NOT about her. \n\nAgain your fiance and yourself are the ones deciding how YOU want the day to be. \nShe get invited, she doesn\u2019t have to go if she is so irritated by the day not being about her. Her coming or not is a her issue. Her presence isn\u2019t required for the event to happen. \n\nHow much more are you willing to give up to appease your entitled attention seeking sister at your own wedding?", "I actually think your dress code is not only reasonable but makes life easier for the guests. I would think that most people have something black in their wardrobe and probably grey or white as well. So it's unlikely that people are going to have to buy anything special. I wonder if your sister is just kicking back because you're not having a traditional wedding and she's jealous of the attention you'll receive?", "NTA\n\nNothing your sister said seems reasonable. I don\u2019t know what her (real) problem is. It\u2019s not controlling it\u2019s like a theme party. You pay - you choose the theme. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. \nIs she jealous?", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like a really pretty wedding. I don't think upstaging everyone who has ever had a wedding is the goal here, but I also think every person who has a wedding wants it to be special and memorable in their own way. Kinda weird your sister doesn't feel that way.", "Nta a lot of weeding have dress code. And colour you choose is easy to find and it can wear to other party too. Maybe you sister jealous of you or something.", "NTA. It's your wedding, so you get to choose the theme, and this is by far not the craziest (clothing) requirement I've heard for a wedding. They even get to choose between 3 colors, I'm sure everyone will find an outfit they like. \n\nAnd btw: I think the idea is awesome, very original but not over the top crazy. Do your thing!", "NTA\nit's your wedding. Your special day. Not wanting to wear white ( which is common ) is nothing wrong / crime.\nUsually guests don't wear white to wedding, bc the bride only wears. ( this is also dress code)\n \n\nThese days there are lot of dress code weddings. \nYou're not the only one. \n\n\nWear colourful and be a princess or queen. \nBe you \n\nBesides both you and your husband, are okay with it.", "NTA. OP, I have to say you were very sly in how you wrote your post by mentioning both you and your fianc\u00e9e have NPD - Narcissistic Personality Disorder. It\u2019s clear almost no one who has responded so far understood what that meant, or at least glossed over it. My guess is that in all other aspects of life, you have been exhausting to be around because everything always needs to be about you (my guess is the same for your fianc\u00e9e?). However, In this case, your wedding, the desire/need for attention is totally appropriate and your request is absolutely not a challenge for your attendees. What woman doesn\u2019t have a little black dress? Or, if you did tell women they could wear their wedding dresses to get more mileage out of them, I am sure some would take you up on the offer. Your wedding sounds like it will be fun, if not a bit over the top and something most will likely talk about for a while if you pull it off. Maybe you should simply tell your sister that she isn\u2019t required to attend if she would be miserable. That you care about her (you mention in comments that she is lovely) and that nothing you are doing is meant to be a dig or to hurt her and wonder if she would be happier if you explicit let her know that you won\u2019t be offended if she doesn\u2019t attend. But, your wedding, your rules, your dress code.", "NTA for wanting a dress code - it sounds like your sister is so used to you claiming the limelight, that she\u2019s really struggling to accept this moment is 100% about you and your fianc\u00e9! And that\u2019s exactly what it should be. I reckon if she doesn\u2019t want to celebrate you both, then she doesn\u2019t have to attend.", "Your sister seems stressful to be sisters with. That was a reasonable request and it seems like she\u2019s projecting \n\nNTA", "YTA. You're pushing into the realm of bridezillahood.  It's acceptable for a bride and groom to have a dress code for the wedding party. It allows the happy couple to be the center of attention; and the pictures do come out looking a lot better.\n\nBut to tell every single guest that they have to wear a certain color is a bit much. If you continue with this demand, be prepared for many of your guests to send their regrets.", "NTA. If a dress code is your only request for your guest, I dont see any problem here.\nYou asked only for a specific color. You didnt ask for a specific stlye nor for specific hairstyle, haircolor or makeup.\nFrom your post and your comments it seem your sister is  jealous, and fear that your wedding would be more loved than hers.\nAlso, you are so kind to want her at your wedding, when she didnt invite you to hers....\nCan i ask why you had been excluded from her wedding?", "Maybe your sister wanted to buy an extravagant dress to have all the spotlight on her and making her wearing something without color make her mad because she wont be \"seen\" as much as see wanted to.\n\nI would love to be able to were black to a wedding and as long as you don't force all the guests to wear only white but give some choices, you are NTA !\n\nIt is YOUR wedding, she can have all the other days to \"stand out\", YOU get to stand out for once !", "YTA. It's one thing to dictate what color your wedding party is wearing because they accepted those terms when agreeing to be in it, but it's very rude to force your guests to wear certain colors.", "You absolutely are a selfish and self-centered Ahole.\n\nIf you want people to wear specific colors to your wedding, then you should buy it for them. And even then  if they don't want to wear it, they shouldn't  have to. \n\nThere is more to life than isntagran photos, and having people dress a certain way does not make the day any more special or meaningful\n In fact, your behavior detracts from the meaningfulness of the day by focusing on some material aspect of it, rather than the spiritual and social bonding ritual that it represents.", "NTA. If you want your guests to wear certain colors so YOU can stand out at YOUR wedding, implement the dress code. This is not the first nor only wedding with a dress code. You even told your family that they could wear copper to stand out more and she was still not pleased. You are being completely reasonable with your dress code request, I don\u2019t understand what she is angry about.", "NTA, she claims to not doing it for herself but others, but if that was true should would agree to the dress code for you. I don't know much about wedding but I don't find it bad to have a dress code.", "NTA. I probably wouldn't go, I don't own anything remotely suitable for a wedding in black grey or white.  and wouldn't want to buy something I'd never wear again. But it's your wedding, you do you.", "NTA. Your sister seems to be responding to some past traumas with her comments here. The vast majority of wedding have a dress code. Many, many weddings have a specific color-themed dress code. And your guests don\u2019t have to wear white\u2014they can wear grey or black as well. Who doesn\u2019t have a black dress they can wear??\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding. It\u2019s all about the two of you. I appreciate the instinct to not have people show up in their wedding attire for the purposes of \u201cupstaging\u201d them, but tbh I cannot imagine someone saying, \u201cI need to wear white to this wedding I GUESS I WILL WEAR MY WEDDING DRESS,\u201d so I\u2019m genuinely unsure what your sis is on about.", "Are you making your Fiance dye his hair blonde so he can match you? Is his natural hair color not good enough? Honestly it sounds like your sister has been forced to watch you take and hog every millisecond of attention growing up while she got no attention. Did you even let he get left over scrabs of attention? It sounds like you want all of your guests to look and feel as ugly as possible, just. Just so you and your fiance strut around decked out in gold. Why not just choose a gold wedding dress and suit? Because not a lot of formal clothes look nice in your color scheme for your guests. Your wedding your choice but be prepared for her not to come and support you.", "YTA. \n\nA wedding should be about enjoying the company of your family and friends as they help you celebrate.  \n\nNot dictating that they throw money away on buying clothes they\u2019ll probably never wear again.", "It's your wedding so your rules. If people don't like it they can not come. NTA", "NTA. Are you sure you have NPD and aren\u2019t just the family scapegoat? Sounds like your sister is more of a narcissist than you are. It\u2019s your wedding and you are being more than accommodating to your guests by allowing white, grays, black, and now copper. It\u2019s actually very common to have a black and white wedding. This is not a narcissistic choice. Your wedding, your way. Period. End of Story.\n\nSide note: asking your guests to wear their own wedding dresses would be an unacceptable ask, but you recognized that and didn\u2019t turn that thought into a reality.
