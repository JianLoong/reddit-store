I didn't have context for much of what I read and either didn't understand the plot, or has some really weird notions of how things worked until someone thought to correct me.   Reading continues to be the only guaranteed way I can relax,  I built a business from selling books for a while, and I have learned a great deal about myself and the world that I could never regret. \n\nAll that to say.... if not at your place then somewhere else... a reader will read.

Books should be the least of his worries.", "Nta but he limiting his daughter reading material sucks. I've read Romeo and juliet at her age and understood.

The father couldn't see what she was selecting.\n\nWhich is on him. If he took her to a library she could also go grab a steamy romance if she was unattended, he's trying to blame someone else for his lack of parenting."]}
