They have monetized and they get some money from it, not to sure how much tho. And my older brother and I have frequently had supporting roles in it.\n\nLast week I had to get glasses and braces on the same day. They videoed me getting the glasses and all that and then after that they videoed me getting my braces put on. I felt extremely uncomfortable with all that in my mouth and they made a joke of having me try to talk and kept that in the video. \n\nThey then had me show off the braces and glasses to the camera and I just felt cringe because I never particularly wanted glasses and braces. And now the comment section of the video is full of people commenting on how handsome I look and all that and it just feels awkward having so many people commenting on my appearance.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I told my parents I no longer want to be a part of their YouTube series\u2026?", "created_utc": 1690220409, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158hfe2/wibta_for_not_wanting_to_be_part_of_my_parents/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The children of these families get NO privacy because everything they do has to be for \"content\". You aren't being paid to give up the remainder of your childhood, but your life IS lining your parents' pockets. You are not able to legally consent to having your image put out there, and your parents are exploiting this by choosing to put personal moments of your life out in public for entertainment value. That's not okay. It wouldn't be okay even if you weren't bothered by it. \n\nThe comment section you reference also grosses me out - these are grown adults (strangers) commenting on a child's appearance. Ugh. \n\nWhile 1000% YWNBTA, you may encounter some pushback from your family about this. They are, after all, benefiting financially from their YouTube channel. But please stand your ground on this.

Their goal is to profit from poisoning the earth. They are responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. There are mass graves on their property.
