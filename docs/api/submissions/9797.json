I\u2019m to make sure no one does anything dangerous like going face first, cramming too many people on one innertube, etc. I\u2019m also instructed to ask anyone who looks like they could be over the weight limit\u2013250 pounds\u2013to weigh themselves on our scale, and deny them entry if they refuse. I\u2019m not super comfortable with this, but it\u2019s much better than risking people\u2019s safety.\n\nHere lies the problem: I lift weights, and for this reason I am very dense\u2013I weigh 185 pounds but somehow wear a size 6. Most of my friends also lift and have similar body compositions to me. For this reason I have trouble estimating how much someone actually weighs.\n\nThis problem presented itself last weekend when an overweight teenage girl wanted to ride the slide. She most likely wasn\u2019t over 250 pounds, but I couldn\u2019t be certain. I\u2019ve gotten better at estimating weights but my supervisor says if there\u2019s any chance they\u2019re over 250 to weigh them, so I approached her gently and asked her to please get on the scale.\u00a0\n\nShe met me with a snarky teenager attitude and said \u201cwhat if I refuse?\u201d She was with a group of teenagers, some of whom were giggling.\n\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t be allowed on the slide,\u201d I said matter-of-factly.\n\nShe rolled her eyes and got on the scale, and her weight wasn\u2019t even close to 250 so I felt kind of bad. She then said \u201cSee?\u201d and went along with her friends.\n\nAlthough she gave me attitude I could tell she was embarrassed. Her face was red as she went back to her friends, who were all thin. I asked my supervisor how he would have handled the situation and he said I did the right thing, that it\u2019s better to hurt someone\u2019s feelings than break someone\u2019s bones.\n\nHowever, yesterday I was called into the office of the owner of the waterpark. She told me she received an angry email from a parent about how I embarrassed their child in front of her friends. I explained to her that I was just following protocol and she asked me how much the girl actually weighed. I gave her the answer and she laughed at me and told me I could never get a job as a weight guesser at a carnival and that I need to do my job better. My supervisor is backing me up and saying I was doing what he has required me to do. I\u2019m thankful for his support but honestly this whole situation is making me feel like an a\\*\\*hole. I know teenage girls are a particularly vulnerable population, as I was a teenage girl not too long ago, and I could have possibly handled that situation with more care. But at the same time safety is my first priority.

Every single person no matter what they look like. Having you guess who does and does not weigh 250 pounds puts you and others in an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation. \n\nWhen I weighed over 200 pounds I didn't look it because of the shape of my body and height. Visual guesses on weight are inaccurate and again, can create embarrassing situations.", "Y\u2019all just need to weigh everyone or no one. The eyeball system is dangerous for all involved. But NTA, you were just trying to do your job and keep the guests safe.", "NTA - Honestly, these sort of things are unfair. Not everyone is capable of guessing someone's weight, just like some people struggle with guessing how old someone is", "NAH You were just doing your job, but holy cow, what an awful policy! It should either be weigh everyone or no one. Making you go up to random people and asking them to get weighed is a good way to get you yelled out by other people for doing your job. And that poor girl who is now probably going to be spending a lot of time wondering why you thought she looked 250 lbs, even if she's nowhere near it.\n\nAnd how many people over the limit have you sent down because they don't look over the weight, but it's because they are very muscular or just carry the weight in a way that makes them look lighter than they are.\n\nYou aren't the asshole, but this policy is", "NTA. People have died on water slides, it\u2019s better to double check. You weren\u2019t doing it to be mean, you were just making sure. I\u2019m sure it was embarrassing for her, but it would be even worse if you didn\u2019t check and she was injured.", "NAH I guess since it\u2019s your job, but this is a horrible fucking policy, good lord. Asking people to weigh themselves in front of everyone if they appear fat? Do you have any idea what that could do to someone\u2019s psyche? Y\u2019all need to change that policy ASAP. \n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a way you could bypass legal issues by putting up signs about weight risk around the slide. If someone is too heavy and gets hurt, it\u2019s their own fault. Public humiliation is not the answer here", "NTA.  Honestly, the policy sucks, but that's not your fault.  It's really, really hard to tell by looking at people how much they weigh.  The water parks I've been to have a scale that everyone gets on and only triggers a green or a red light.  No one is singled out and no one knows the number.   Safety is important and you can't just trust people to tell the truth but there's no need to single anyone out or leave much window for teasing (I mean, if they can't go on, they can't go on, but weight is private information).", "NTA. Safety first. You followed procedure. \n\nIf a similar situation occurs you might feel better if you ask a few people in the group to weigh. That way your not singling anyone out and no one feels embarrassed.", "Info: how much did she weigh. That has a HUGE bearing. We\u2019re you 20 lbs off, 80 lbs off\u2026?", "NTA.  Better safe than sorry.", "NAH - I know people who have gone on slides where you can ride as two people on a double ring and they got stuck because they were over the weight limit. \n\nTeenagers are gonna give attitude to people they think are being petty. \n\nAll in all everything worked out fine \ud83e\udd37", "NTA \n\nThere are weight limits for a reason. Safety. And so you don\u2019t get killed on a ride. You followed protocol.", "INFO: I\u2019m having trouble understanding how you can be that bad at guessing someone\u2019s weight. A teenage girl weighing 250 would be incredibly obvious, why did you make a girl who is nowhere near that get on a scale?\n\n250 pounds is incredibly large. If she was well below that, you\u2019re just judging her for being overweight at all. Sounds like you are not good at this job and should find a new one.", "Nta. The policy sucks and probably should be amended to be able to pull people aside and talk to them privately and be weighed privately rather than be humiliated. Still I get the safety aspect and it's your job. That said I also get where the girl is coming from too as that kind of thing can be super damaging.", "NTA. You were just trying to do your job and it can be hard to estimate someone's weight.", "NTA\n\nIt is your job to make sure everyone is safe. You didn't do it to spite her or single her out. You had legitimate concern. It so sucks you have to do this part of the job, it's got to be terrible.\n\nI get why the boss had to talk to you, because she got reamed by a parent. But she should know you have no choice and if even one person gets by who is unsafe and something bad happens, she could get sued like mega tons.", "Info- how far off were you? I get that the water park has policies but also if you were ridiculously off then you made a bad call and probably negatively affected a young person's self image. I don't think you had ill intent but if you were far enough off I would say you were an ass for wildly incorrect.", "This is a situation in where you cant win my friend. Having a scale right there instead of somewhere better is not your fault, and as you said you dont feel comfortable with this but you want everything to be safe for everyone. Just the fact that you arent feeling ok with this makes you empathetic. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIf she had weighed too much and got injured, you'd be in trouble for letting her get on the slide.", "NTA. You an only do your job to the best of your ability. \n\n\n You should have asked the owner to guess how much you weigh.", "NTA! You were just doing your job\u2026\n\nMoving forward, just start weighing everyone! This way you won\u2019t discriminate anyone, and also, you will soon get better estimating weight.", "NTA ask them if you should always just guess", "Info\n\nWas the scale in full view of the public? \n\nDid you ask her in a quiet, respectful manner, since, you, \"know about how teenage girls (actually all people) are vulnerable about their weight\"?\n\nDoes the business have the policy to weigh everyone? A certain percentage of people? If not, would you be willing to suggest it?\n\nAre \"people skills\" recommended for your job? How could you handle something similar in the future?", "NAH Seems like it's literally your job.", "NTA. Damn, some people really do think shame it's worse than death.", "NAH. you followed procedure, you did your job the way it was supposed to be done. you didn\u2019t intend to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. however her feelings were definitely hurt, which is understandable. nobody wants to be weighed unexpectedly in front of their friends and strangers", "As someone who is overweight and looks to weigh LESS than I am (weight 280, look about 240), NTA. You did your job, it SOUNDS like you did it politely and respectfully (as well as you could anyways), and it was out of concern for safety.\n\nIt's good your supervisor has your back on this.", "Info: how much did she weigh?", "i understand you were doing your job but still it\u2019s not a guessing competition to actually guess her weight\u2026", "NTA", "NTA. You'd have gotten into more trouble if she was overweight and got injured!", "YTA. She wasn\u2019t even close to 250.

He slipped out, fell 100+ feet, and died of horrific blunt force trauma. Family sued the amusement park and various others because the ride operator let him on in the first place.

Decapitated a 10 yr old boy.", "Yeah this is entirely on the company - there's a better way to handle this i.e. the weigh-in area should be screened for privacy, the rider should have just been asked to step aside before they rode, the employee should have a script that's already been vetted for sensitivity issues, plus there should be a pretty hefty safety margin involved. No one's life or safety should depend on a minimum wage employee guessing people's weight and weighing them in public.", "Maybe it would be a better policy to weight everyone? Not single people out? \n\nOP themself says that people can look far different than what they weigh", "Yeah, this is totally fair. I get that it\u2019s a public safety issue first and foremost, there just has to be a solution between saying nothing and public humiliation, you know?", "Then maybe the water park should have a scale built in so it\u2019s not up to people to judge other people based on their bodies.", "What's that?", "Most places I've been have scales that everyone has to get on and only show red or green, no numbers (and it's not a big light). There's also usually scales not at the top of the slides that are not \"operated\" by attendants so people can check themselves and there are signs before you get in line with the weight limits (besides on websites before you even get to the park).   The attendants are usually quite good about being discreet about it.  The only time I've ever noticed someone being turned away is because the rider throws a big fit and in those cases, I don't feel sorry for them.  It's not like the weight limit is a secret and I highly doubt they didn't know they were at least close.  It can't feel good, I'm sure, but your life is more important than your ego, you know?  Why bring more attention to yourself?  The rider in this story could have just stepped on quickly, OO would have said it sorry and it would have been over, but the rider drew more attention to herself being difficult about it.", "Not maybe, absolutely. But it\u2019s not fair for us (you) to have a go at this guy for doing his job. He had company restrictions and policies to maintain. He could have handled it differently, but in the moment he did what was asked of him. The company is the one who needs to do better and have a more discreet approach.", "Does it have a big horn and whistle that honk when someone gets a red light", "No, just a little red light."]}
