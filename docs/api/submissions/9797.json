I\u2019m to make sure no one does anything dangerous like going face first, cramming too many people on one innertube, etc. I\u2019m also instructed to ask anyone who looks like they could be over the weight limit\u2013250 pounds\u2013to weigh themselves on our scale, and deny them entry if they refuse. I\u2019m not super comfortable with this, but it\u2019s much better than risking people\u2019s safety.\n\nHere lies the problem: I lift weights, and for this reason I am very dense\u2013I weigh 185 pounds but somehow wear a size 6. Most of my friends also lift and have similar body compositions to me. For this reason I have trouble estimating how much someone actually weighs.\n\nThis problem presented itself last weekend when an overweight teenage girl wanted to ride the slide. She most likely wasn\u2019t over 250 pounds, but I couldn\u2019t be certain. I\u2019ve gotten better at estimating weights but my supervisor says if there\u2019s any chance they\u2019re over 250 to weigh them, so I approached her gently and asked her to please get on the scale.\u00a0\n\nShe met me with a snarky teenager attitude and said \u201cwhat if I refuse?\u201d She was with a group of teenagers, some of whom were giggling.\n\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t be allowed on the slide,\u201d I said matter-of-factly.\n\nShe rolled her eyes and got on the scale, and her weight wasn\u2019t even close to 250 so I felt kind of bad. She then said \u201cSee?\u201d and went along with her friends.\n\nAlthough she gave me attitude I could tell she was embarrassed. Her face was red as she went back to her friends, who were all thin. I asked my supervisor how he would have handled the situation and he said I did the right thing, that it\u2019s better to hurt someone\u2019s feelings than break someone\u2019s bones.\n\nHowever, yesterday I was called into the office of the owner of the waterpark. She told me she received an angry email from a parent about how I embarrassed their child in front of her friends. I explained to her that I was just following protocol and she asked me how much the girl actually weighed. I gave her the answer and she laughed at me and told me I could never get a job as a weight guesser at a carnival and that I need to do my job better. My supervisor is backing me up and saying I was doing what he has required me to do. I\u2019m thankful for his support but honestly this whole situation is making me feel like an a\\*\\*hole. I know teenage girls are a particularly vulnerable population, as I was a teenage girl not too long ago, and I could have possibly handled that situation with more care. But at the same time safety is my first priority. Does that make me the a\\*\\*hole?", "created_utc": 1676230102, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110nz69/aita_for_making_a_teenage_girl_weigh_herself_at/", "score": 6141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She slammed into me halfway down, we went through the rest slamming around and tangled up, then when we came out she landed on top of me and I was under water, trapped, for dangerously long.\n\nI haven\u2019t been on a slide since.  I\u2019m overweight, so I say this with that in mind.\n\nWater slides are dangerous as fuck especially considering how they work with people of larger sizes.  They shoot down so much faster than lighter people.  You could kill someone\u2019s if you aren\u2019t careful.  A scale at the bottom would be less obtrusive, sure, or a sign that is worded like those \u201cwe card everyone who even looks like they might be under 30\u201d signs at the gas station.  Or just weigh everyone.  But he is NTA.  Yes, it\u2019s embarrassing, but this is a safety issue.", "Maybe have a scale(like a weight plate or something) at the entrance to the ride and everyone gets weighed before getting in line?", "My question is, why not just have everyone get weighed? That way it\u2019s not unfair, and OP isn\u2019t put in such a terrible position.", "I got weighed for a donkey ride down the rim of the Grand Canyon. And even though I was under probably by 20#\u2019s I still felt bad for my donkey and thought he hated to carry me, especially on the way back up. \nWeight and checking is best for anything that has to carry your body. Machine or not. Safety first my friend.", "There has to be a better way to do this.", "Hey NTA \nI\u2019ve been in this water parks not in the us, but still they had the scale thing and it shows the weight but its not like a big numbers telling your weight, it just shows like a color thing when you surpass the weight it has a red light and if you\u2019re good its green. \nAlso they make everyone weight themselves so you avoid the person in charge have to decide if you look fat enough.", "Ye skill isto be paid minimum wage xD\n\nAlso if you want no things like this use scale with allowed/not or weight everyone really safer.", "It's irrelevant if she dies because overweight it's on op and op is minimal wage....\n\n\nFew days ago I saw Turkish earthquake picture where engineers guild building was standing surrounded by destroyed buildings because they cut corners in safety. Never cut corners in safety!", "No one should see the number. It should be a yes or a no.", "If the scale only gives can ride/cannot then it's easier for op to just ask everyone to be weighed before entering.", "That might be somewhat unavoidable (especially if weight limits are different per waterslide/ride). You're already paying an operator to stand at the top and supervise guests, it would increase operating costs significant if you needed a second employee at the bottom weighing people. I'm trying to think of a safe way to leave the scale unmanned but you know people would cheat.", ">100lbs over the weight limit\n\nOh for sure, thats why the policy is there, but youre talking about OP being 100 pounds off BEYOND the weight limit. Is it even possible that this person might have fallen off if they were only 10 pounds over the limit? Its OK that OP failed to judge their weight appropriately, but now that they have a frame of reference, they should massively be increasing their expectations for how large someone needs to be before they cant go on. I'd probably avoid weighing someone even if I thought they might be exactly 260 pounds.", "Yes. In this case she would've gotten a green light and everything would've been fine. If someone ever gets a red light it's embarassing but I guess it happens way less and the person doesn't die.", "I was thinking of setting up some sort of screen so only the staff member could see the weight but that's probably easier", "Wait have I been weighed at a water park without knowing it?", "As a self described fat person,  I agree.", "> That takes way too much time. \n\nIt doesn't, of course. I've been to a bunch of waterparks where they weigh literally everyone, and the safety delay to make sure the slide is clear is always longer than the time spent weighing.", "I assume people have to wait in line for the ride? What are they doing while waiting?", "This is literally the worst take", "Prevent singling people out, by singling people out. Genius", "The water park near us has this same system, except the lights can only be seen by the attendant.  There's elevators off to the side, where someone over the limit can be quietly taken back down.", "Agree in principle, however I suspect the flashing red light of fatness (after all her friends came up green) would be just as embarrassing to a teenage girl as being asked to weigh in.  It's a crappy situation to be in, but necessary, and def NTA.  Gotta err on the side of safety.", "Scales are cheap, easy enough to have a self-check one at the bottom of the slides, as well as in the change rooms. Then one at the top that everyone goes over for those who decided to ignore the mass limits.", "Forget wristbands! I was weighed for a zip line and had it written on my upper arm in permanent marker!", "But the dead body of an overweight rider would be wearing an OK wristband, and footage would show the park staff did not issue one to them, so legally theyd be in the clear. The only reason they have the policy is to legally be in the clear, to begin with.", "You'd be surprised. I'm in a lot of Disney groups and I always see parents either ask for tricks or give tricks to make their kids appear taller so they can ride something. The answer always comes down to how expensive it is. It's a shame they would want to risk their kid's life for a ride.", "It happens all too often. Went to Sea World last year and rode one of the big roller coasters there. This dad in front of us held up the entire ride for 15 minutes because they wouldn\u2019t let his daughter ride. Buckled himself in and refused to get out. She was at least 4\u201d too short. He screamed at every employee working the ride and then at the managers, all while his young daughter sobbed.", "If a parent is in denial that child is overweight, they may be hostile to any implication that they are", "Wasn't there that case of a kid whose parents lied to get him on a ride and he died? This was just last year I think, but honestly my sense of time is pretty screwed up now because of the pandemic.", "I've heard/read stuff from EntitledParents/InsaneParents/etc stories and gotta say; TONS of parents risk their kids lives for ALL the weight/height/etc restrictions because \"Well they wanna ride and I'll hold them\" or some nonsense. To the point of literally distracting employees for their kids to sneak on to rides that could literally kill them", "You can't say no to little Jimothy, what if he gets upset??", "I think it'd be like Challenge 21 or 25 in the UK. Essentially, if someone looks like they're over 150, you ask them to get weighed to ensure they're not over 250.", "If they're that fat that they're triggering alarms in your head then absolutely weigh them. \nBest case scenario you're saving lives.\nWorst case scenario yeah, it's embarrassing for them. But it should be if they get to that point where they're a literal hazard at a water park. And it's not your fault, they could have a salad every now and then. \n\nJust because it hurts to hear that doesn't make me wrong, and all this indulging and enabling is killing lives. Jesus, now we can't even point out that people are fat, we're supposed to pretend otherwise.", "maybe she didn\u2019t want to post the girls weight because it\u2019s no one else\u2019s business? the point of the post is that she was unsure and weighed to be safe, no one else needs to know the girls weight.", "Happened to me once for a different reason. Waited in line for over an hour, reached the top only to be told that my attire wasn\u2019t theme park appropriate and I need to change and go back and wait in line. No indication of dress code policies anywhere near the ticket counter or the entrance. Pissed me off majorly. \n\nThey really heard a earful that day.", "It's true. In the UK we have 'challenge 25' (if you look younger than 25, you get asked to show your ID when buying age-gated products). I'm 43 and I got carded buying whiskey a few weeks ago. As a short guy, I always get a good laugh when that happens but better the employee does it than get shit from management about it.", "I\u2019m an Arab Muslim woman with white skin and I don\u2019t wear the hijab for medical issues. I\u2019m never looked at until I\u2019m with a family member wearing a hijab. I always notice people looking at my mom.", "If that had happened to me as a teenage girl, I wouldn't have had to worry about walking back down the stairs- I'd have flung myself off the tower or just dropped dead from the sheer humiliation (body image issues + social anxiety + a rare disease that caused me to be overweight = one hell of a bad time). Just imagining it makes me want to cry.", "They should have a test seat near the queue for the ride. If the ride has different sized seats it will be one of the bigger ones. If it's a tight fit but you want to go for it, you might need to flag down an operator and ask them to guide you to the row with the larger seat.", "Just FYI Op is a woman.", "The post itself points out that's not true. Two people who are about the same size can be drastically different weights, especially when it's two people who look chubby because you don't see the muscle mass or lack of under the padding. On tall people it's even harder to judge because they have more space to carry the weight (both muscle and fat).", "Yes, Schlitterbahn in Kansas.", "I don't recall there having been a test seat, but this was also seven years ago...", "human density changes drastically\nim 6'1 thin and weigh 210\n\nmy coworker whos 5'7 and has the aame waiste size is also 210", "There's no way someone mistakes 135 for 250 unless they're completely incapable of estimating. I could see 200 for 250. Some people's body shapes really hide or overexaggerate \"excess weight\" and as you get higher, the margin of error does seem to increase.", "My sister and I look very similar except our weights.  I\u2019m visibly heavier than she is both around my waist and my curves, but nobody so far has guessed the difference between us is as high as 50lbs.  They usually put it it closer to 20-30lbs, especially if we\u2019re not standing right next to each other.", "I guess they might not, but they should! I haven't been to a 6 flags in a long time but I know other parks that do that.", "I mean the core competency of being a lifeguard is not guessing people's weight.", "Guessing the weight of guests really shouldn't be part of the lifeguard's job, and it's on the owner and supervisor to have put OP in that position. She shouldn't need to change jobs just because her bosses set her up to fail like that.", "When i was younger i was short and fat. I got singles out for both reasons. I didn't mind, because when i was 8 i went to a water park. They has a \"sui@!de slide\" , a straight, short, super fast slide. I was just barely tall enough. I definitely didn't weigh enough. As soon as I tipped the top my back left the slide, and didn't make contact again till the bottom, that i hit with so much force i had bruises from shoulder bone to ankle bone that lasted me 2 weeks. I almost died, so did my mom who swears i almost went over the edge on my way down. We left after that slide, i could hardly walk my back hurt so bad....think belly flop on your back. I would rather be embarrassed than hurting.", "That is a horrible idea. Instead of being embarrassed in a small crowd you get to walk around the entire park and have everyone clearly see you are too heavy for the rides", "I went to the six flags in Gurnee last August and I think most of the rides I saw had a test seat, if not all", "The other choice is getting publicly weighed, and then performing a walk of shame down the stairs while everyone watches. Not sure if \"you can ride the red rides\" bracelet is worse than that. A bar code scan, as someone else suggested, would be better.", ">Have a platform near the top of the ride and a screen with some sort of discrete indicator for the ride supervisor.\n\nYeah but that slows down the line, which means LESS MONEY FOR OWNER.\n\nOH NO!\n\nThe owner is the true AH here. OP was just doing his job, and teen girl did nothing wrong, and neither did teen girl's mum.", "Yes, the bar code scan is a great idea, weights should also be at the bottom of the stairs so the walk of shame isn\u2019t needed back down the stairs. I was at a water park this summer where you got in line electronically and scanned your bar code when it was your turn. Weights could be on those easily. I don\u2019t understand why people who are over/under weight/height try to sneak on. A ride isn\u2019t worth risking your life.", "I know someone whose parents raised him with a ton of arbitrary rules that made no sense, so for the longest time he thought that all rules were just made up by someone for no reason, and could be ignored. That sort of mindset can take a lot of time to overcome.", "100% this. I used to teach horse riding. In many riding schools there is a weight limit for the good of the horse (they shouldn\u2019t carry more than 15-20% of their weight including tack). Normally the weight limit is 12-13 stone. The amount of people that kick off about that and state that there are heavy riders that can ride light and light riders that can ride heavy is unbelievable. They refuse to acknowledge that your weight is your weight, meaning whilst you can be as balanced as you can be, your weight is still the same."]}
