I\u2019m to make sure no one does anything dangerous like going face first, cramming too many people on one innertube, etc. I\u2019m also instructed to ask anyone who looks like they could be over the weight limit\u2013250 pounds\u2013to weigh themselves on our scale, and deny them entry if they refuse. I\u2019m not super comfortable with this, but it\u2019s much better than risking people\u2019s safety.\n\nHere lies the problem: I lift weights, and for this reason I am very dense\u2013I weigh 185 pounds but somehow wear a size 6. Most of my friends also lift and have similar body compositions to me. For this reason I have trouble estimating how much someone actually weighs.\n\nThis problem presented itself last weekend when an overweight teenage girl wanted to ride the slide. She most likely wasn\u2019t over 250 pounds, but I couldn\u2019t be certain. I\u2019ve gotten better at estimating weights but my supervisor says if there\u2019s any chance they\u2019re over 250 to weigh them, so I approached her gently and asked her to please get on the scale.\u00a0\n\nShe met me with a snarky teenager attitude and said \u201cwhat if I refuse?\u201d She was with a group of teenagers, some of whom were giggling.\n\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t be allowed on the slide,\u201d I said matter-of-factly.\n\nShe rolled her eyes and got on the scale, and her weight wasn\u2019t even close to 250 so I felt kind of bad. She then said \u201cSee?\u201d and went along with her friends.\n\nAlthough she gave me attitude I could tell she was embarrassed. Her face was red as she went back to her friends, who were all thin. I asked my supervisor how he would have handled the situation and he said I did the right thing, that it\u2019s better to hurt someone\u2019s feelings than break someone\u2019s bones.\n\nHowever, yesterday I was called into the office of the owner of the waterpark. She told me she received an angry email from a parent about how I embarrassed their child in front of her friends. I explained to her that I was just following protocol and she asked me how much the girl actually weighed. I gave her the answer and she laughed at me and told me I could never get a job as a weight guesser at a carnival and that I need to do my job better. My supervisor is backing me up and saying I was doing what he has required me to do. I\u2019m thankful for his support but honestly this whole situation is making me feel like an a\\*\\*hole. I know teenage girls are a particularly vulnerable population, as I was a teenage girl not too long ago, and I could have possibly handled that situation with more care. But at the same time safety is my first priority.

It's really, really hard to tell by looking at people how much they weigh.  The water parks I've been to have a scale that everyone gets on and only triggers a green or a red light.  No one is singled out and no one knows the number.
