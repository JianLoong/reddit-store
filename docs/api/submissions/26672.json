Nope. \n\nAlso, a grown man who won't pay his bills without reminders from a live human is not the definition of stingy, it's irresponsible.", "NTA, he's expecting too much from you.

You are completely right in thinking you might as well be on your own.\n\nAs far as using him for his money, that's laughable. You are paying 50% of bills on about half the income he has. 50% makes sense in an overly simplified situation where you both had the same income. I personally think shared expenses should be equity based on income because that 50% hits one person a lot harder. Imo he's using you for money because I think they expenses aren't fairly divided.\n\nI'm sorry this is the situation you are in and hope things get better for you, wish you the best.", "Does he want you to give him iou's for the 50% when you are on maternity leave?", "Ummm why did you decide to have a child with this person without and discussion about your finances ahead of time.

How would you pay rent if you are staying home?", "NTA - If you're not exaggerating then he's being very unreasonable. \n\nIn a relationship it's important that both partners are contributing in ways that make things seem fair, even if it doesn't mean they are contributing in the same ways.\n\nIf you're going to be a stay at home Mum, do the majority of the baby duties, the majority of the cooking cleaning etc, then he is completely insane if he also expects you to pay half. If you have no money coming in at all then he should pay for everything while you look after the home and baby. If you're getting some money then maybe you can still contribute a little, but like 20% maximum to take a little strain off him, not close to 50%.", "\"expects me to be a stay at home mom\" and \"expects me to pay for 50%\" don't go together, especially on top of \"he doesn't contribute... to the household\"\n\nHe is dead weight.

Make sure you file for child support. Don't matter if you think you don't need his money, your child might, or you might want to save it for their higher education/ private school/ a car what ever.   \nThis isn't a good relationship to stay in, and what kind of relationship would you be displaying and teaching this child is 'okay' and good.   \nNTA Please, please move on.", "He expects you to pay half the bills when you make no money?\n\nI don\u2019t like the idea of 50/50 with a serious partner, especially with children involved.\n\nIf you just shacked up maybe 50/50 makes sense, but as the relationship develops so should the split of responsibilities.\n\nYa\u2019ll gotta contribute 50% of effort to the relationship, not necessarily % of finances.  \n\nAn example of this is him working to pay the bills while you take care of the baby and home as possible (first few months good luck with that).\n\nIf he says taking care of a baby isn\u2019t that hard give him ONE Saturday to do it all himself and see how he makes out.", "Nta.

From now on, you do only half the things of all the shared responsibilities and none of his.\n\nAlso if he wants a lift, he can pay you all the fuel costs plus a surcharge fee for the additional wear on your car.\n\nThen let him have his half of the rent. You may even find it liberating to have suddenly less placed upon your shoulders.\n\nA compromise that will make him look like the asshole if he refuses.", "ESH. He sucks.

Look, if he wants to split work across traditional gender roles, that's fine, but it means that all the earned income responsibilities/bills are on him to take care of. \n\nHe's an AH and you are kind of an AH to yourself for having a child with him. I mean, can complain about it all you want, but you had to see it coming.\n\nSo, what's the plan?", "A grown man and his mommy still pays his phone bill? \nNTA and move out.

He was probably never told no. Never had to make a sacrifice. His mom still pays for his phone bill. He is 27 and about to be a father. He needs to grow up. With no income, you cannot pay 50% of the bills. Also, he isn't even helping with the housework. He wants you to be a SAHM doing 100% of the housework and child care while also paying 50% of the bills. That is unfair and unrealistic.", "Does he have a lot saved, investments and such, or is he just spending all the extra money on himself with nothing much to show for it?", "Money issues are probably one of the biggest problems couples have. There's such an absurd perception that equal is what's best and fair, instead of equity.\n\nA friend has 6 children and has always been a SAHM. Her husband was hired into his job right from college. I learned a lot by how they chose to handle things because it was probably the first non-traditional example I knew of. Meaning, when dad is at home, she wants to make sure they can have quality time together and/or he can have quality time with the kids. So, \"fair isn't always equal\" is part of how they think about things. \n\nYour ask is not unreasonable. His situation right now is cheaper than child support or alimony would be (and, I'm kidding - I'm not, like, saying to leave him). But this is a major issue you need to address now before you go on maternity leave. \n\nBesides, you growing the baby is labor; you being at home with the baby is labor - you not getting an income for it doesn't negate the work and his lack of respect for it.", "NTA, expecting you to pay half the bills with no income is pretty odd.  \nBut then, thinking you are after his money at 2100 month made me do a double take.  \nSAHM is a full time job, with loads of overtime that doesn't have a paycheck.", "How much do you like this guy?", "Duuuuude dude dude. This is not cool.

IANAL, check your local laws.", "Start preparing to move, meet with a family law attorney where you are now and confirm that you're good to go and then just go.

NTA", "I hope things get better for you", "Aaaaand there it is. \n\nHe wants you to completely deplete your savings so you can't leave him, and then will have nowhere to go and no other choice but to continue being his bang-maid and bearing his children to prove that his dick works.\n\nHe is absolutely old enough to know better, and know that he's taking advantage of you. You've mentioned in comments that you've tried to explain finances to him, and that the time he was in charge of money, he chose to pocket what you gave him instead of actually pay bills.\n\nHe's DARVO-ing... Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim & Offender.\n\nDenying what he's doing, attacking you for daring to question him, and then claiming that it's *you* who is financially abusing *him* and saying you only want his money.\n\nEqual does not necessarily mean equitable.

You can do the next best thing and dump him now. \n\nTalk to trusted family & friends, because a pregnant woman leaving an abusive boyfriend is one of the most dangerous situations to be in. \n\nYou may not want to think of him as abusive, but he is. It's been almost a decade, and he's got you doing all the domestic labor, all the emotional labor, cooking, cleaning, prepping, driving- none of which you should be doing this far into a pregnancy, and *doubly so* for a high risk pregnancy with multiple medical complications.\n\nPut his name on the birth certificate, and take his ass to court for child support (since you know he won't pay for it out of the kindness of his heart).\n\nDiscussions like division of labor, finances, home care, parenting styles, etc- these all need to come *before* you decide to have a child with someone... and they need to be in equitable agreement BEFORE you actually get pregnant. \n\nHe's still putting himself first- before you, and before his child. And it is 100% by choice and by design.\n\nYou will be an asshole if you subject yourself or your child to him any longer.

You pay everything, I stay home and will clean and cook everything unless I am sick/busy and need your help in which case you will pitch in and we split childcare and any child related cleaning 50/50. 2. We both work and pay 50/50 and you will start taking care of 50% of the chores, cooking, cleaning and childcare. 3. I leave, and you pay whatever child support the courts deem. I am not your maid. We both made this child so you do not get out of equal parenting responsibilities. I am not going to accept being treated as less than. Either give me the respect I deserve as the mother of your child or watch me walk right out of your life and raise this child to understand their worth, because I damn well know mine.

Was he like this before you got pregnant?", "Why are you having a child with a child?", "Please check your local laws NOW. You said you could move in with your mom? It might be hard after you give birth but before it\u2019s probably possible and he can\u2019t do anything about it.

Especially if you leave before the baby is born, the laws governing his rights and responsibilities regarding the child will be dictated by the state you reside in, not him.  Go now.

He isn't going to be more than a parent who pays child support so it's definitely worth leaving in my opinion. What purpose does he even serve?
