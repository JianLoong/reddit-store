For context, my mum and dad are divorced. I live with my mum and see my dad for 1-2 days a month. I\u2019ve never really got along with my dad because he cheated on my mum when I was a baby then married the woman he cheated with. I do love my dad but he isn\u2019t involved in a lot of my mums decisions because when my parents divorced, they both decided my mum would get full custody and he could see me and my sister (18f) whenever. \n\nMy sister has tons of piercings (23 i believe). Because my sister got so many piercings at around my age, I was allowed to get the same piercings as the piercings she got at my age. For example, my sister got her septum done when she was 13, so I did too. My sister has always been my dads favourite, so no matter how she dressed, what piercings she got, clothes she wore or colour she dyed her hair - she would never get even a snarky comment. \n\nWell I have 5 piercings currently. My ear lobes, septum, belly button and most recently my tongue. Now it\u2019s easy to hide a septum piercing, you just flip it up. But a year ago my dad saw my belly button piercing and freaked out and called my mum to confirm i was allowed to get it done, my mum confirmed and stated she\u2019s my primary parent and will make the decisions. \n\nTwo days ago, I got my tongue pierced - and if you don\u2019t know about tongue piercings, they swell up like crazy after you get them done. I saw my dad yesterday. He noticed my tongue piercing and started screaming, saying that i\u2019ve ruined my body. I yelled back and explained how my sister had the same piercings as me when she was my age and that  a piece of metal in my body doesn\u2019t affect my looks completely. I then proceeded to tell him he has no rights to any opinions on my looks (for example when he yelled at me for dying my blonde hair brown then yelled when i bleached it back to blonde). I don\u2019t know if I was in the wrong for telling him he doesn\u2019t have a right to my decisions and claiming he favourites my sister.", "created_utc": 1704750986, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191xasl/aita_for_yelling_at_my_dad_after_he_discovered_my/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dude is barely even a parent and wants to have an opinion lol.", "NTA\n\nYou told a parent. The primary parent, at that. Why would he not be angry at your sister for \"ruining\" her body and then be a hypocrite when you want the same?", "NTA and screaming at a child for their decisions isn't the way to be an effective parent. \n\nHOWEVER there is a reason piercings and tattoos require parental approval. While not that big a deal they are a commitment both in their care and permanent mark they make on your body. \"My sister got it too\" isn't a good comeback. After he's calmed down, talk to your dad about why these expressions mean something to you. You don't need his permission as Mom is your primary parent, but maybe if he understood you were getting them with intention and because you really love the art of them, he may not feel like you're a kid eager to plug a bunch of holes in your body to keep up with your sibling.", "I\u2019m just trying to picture you screaming with a giant swollen tongue. \u201cI\u2019M THO MADTH ATH UUUUU!!!\u201d", "NTA\n\n> mum would get full custody \n\nParent with custody gets to make these decisions.", "NTA- he's just bitter that he doesn't have more say. I'd wager he's more mad at your mum than you.", "Jesus, 13 is too young to get these types of piercings, even with parental consent. Why can\u2019t kids just be kids for a little longer?!", "NTA. Like your dad, I will never understand why people want to disfigure their own bodies like that, but I respect their decisions to do what they will with them. Just be sure that you're getting the piercings because you want them and not just because you want to prove a point to your dad about your sister.", "Info: is it legal to get those piercings at your age? Follow up did you have mums permission.\n\nReguardless of the answer NTA simple because screaming at a child is wildly innaproprite and it is your body to do with as you please, within the scope of law and local cultural norms.", "NTA But I do think your mom is wildly irresponsible for letting her children make an insane body mods like tongue piercings. I get dying hair, i understand a few piercings, but this is bonkers.", "NTA but you should definitely talk to your dad after y\u2019all have calmed down.\nAnd maybe consider if the two of you need counseling if some sort (e.g. therapy). To an outsider (me) with no other information, and based on this one post, it sounds like there are unresolved issues stemming from the divorce (his cheating, your sister\u2019s past resulting in your feelings of favoritism)", "NTA\n\nSomeone who chooses to spend 1-2 days per month with their offspring, doesn\u2019t get a vote. In any parental decisions.", "Tell him to go bag his head. You\u2019re old enough and wise enough to know your own body and what you can handle. If he\u2019s not the primary parent then he gets very little say. I got my daughter\u2019s ears pierced when she was 13, after she asked me if it was okay. Her Dad tried to start a fight over it and I told him to pull his head in. Told him it wasn\u2019t up for discussion and if he had a problem that was on him, not me", "NTA at all. I've been in your shoes before, I was the least favorite to my dad. I'm really glad that you stood up for yourself because that can be a really hard thing to do sometimes \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA for you. Both parents are the AHs. Yes, mum is primary guardian, but it is a lot of piercings and if your sister did it, it doesn't mean you have to too, and it is her responsibility for allowing you to do that. Dad is also an AH because he has no right to scream at you for what you did to your own body when he is not the main guardian.", "[deleted]", "NTA but try not raising your voice. You are absolutely correct that your father has no say, but yelling that in his face is only going to egg him on. A better approach is to remain calm and quiet and factual. \"I received permission from my mother, who is the sole authority I require. If you are unhappy with the situation, feel free to discuss it with her.\"", "NTA. \n\nBut ad someone who's had their belly button and tongue pierced, I'm curious where you live that you were able to do it before you were 16? Unless you did it yourself or by someone who was not a professional, in which case that's a bit risky.", "Nta. Ruined your body?

Man probably can\u2019t name even one of her teachers yet he wants to act like a parent smh", "You expect a 15 year old to council her parent on the theory of body altering and the psychological advantages of it?... wtf? End of the day she knows her rights, and she knows his (or lack thereof)... she also knows her boundaries and has made it crystal clear to her Dad not to cross them, she doesn't have to explain anything to him...", "Agreed! I have loads of piercings but I waited until I was an adult to get them. Yes, piercings aren\u2019t permanent but they still affect your body. As you grow, your face will change shape and the piercings will migrate. And then when you\u2019re an adult, you might not want the piercings anymore and then be stuck with scars. These are all things that people need to think about when getting piercings and teenagers aren\u2019t thinking about those things. Getting a piercing because \u201cmy sister also got it\u201d isn\u2019t a great reason to get a piercing done.", "I knew a kid I think she was like 14-15 when I was growing up and she had a tongue piercing \nMaybe a little young for that, but I also don\u2019t have piercings that aren\u2019t in my ears", "I honestly wouldn\u2019t call a tongue piercing particularly extreme. They tend to heal very quickly and well, and they\u2019re one of the most reversible piercings around (in that the scarring is pretty much zero and the hole can close up in a matter of days). I\u2019d go out on a limb and say that while they seem extreme, a simple lobe piercing has a higher risk of infection or long term damage.", "my main problem with him being mad is the fact that her sister never got yelled at by him, yes i think it would be nice of the mom to inform him but i mean she only sees him 1-2 days a month why would he get to say no", "You make it sound as if OP hates their dad and is 5 years old throwing a tantrum.\n\nTalking to your parent who you love is perfectly normal.\nSet boundaries, sure but communication is still important.", "Explaining why something is meaningful to you is part of growing up. Maybe the dad is just an AH and it\u2019s about control. Maybe he overreacted and a conversation once things are cooled will make the next piercing go over more smoothly. She does know her rights and mom is supportive, but why make everything into a fight if it doesn\u2019t need to be.", "Tongue piercings can actually be quite dangerous if done incorrectly. The piercer can hit a blood vessel and you can actually bleed out. Plus if the piercing rejects you could end up with a split tongue. There\u2019s a reason most reputable shops keep tongue piercings at 18+.", "How tf did you get that b.s from my comment? NOWHERE did i mention hate towards her Dad, op is obviously well aware of her legal rights and is exercising them, so my pointing that out is saying op hates her Dad? Oiiisshh... shoulda just kept scrolling passed... pffffft", "Nobody is making it a fight, her Dad tried to dictate something she had been given permission to do from the parent that has FULL CUSTODY... and she shut him down... where's the fighting, if your talking about the dad's issues over it, that is all he can do is whine and complain because end of the day he doesn't have any legal right to question it.", "You\u2019re right in that it was a bit of a leap but I also wasn\u2019t actually saying that. It was more of a hyperbolic statement.\n\nHowever, my point was you seemed highly offended that the person above suggested she talk to her dad about why she wants to do hair dyes and piercings and that she shouldn\u2019t, when in every relationship, parent child, spouse, friendship, it is perfectly normal to communicate with the other person. \nAnd if you don\u2019t, besides some personal issues with communication, i can only see either you don\u2019t care enough about the relationship to communicate, or you have already tried and it didn\u2019t work."]}
