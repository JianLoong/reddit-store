His father was a friend of mine that I met through work and I introduced the two. He dipped when my sister was only a couple months pregnant with his kid. \n\nHe moved to his home country and never looked back. \n\nSo we live in a small white town and my nephew is like the only person here that isn\u2019t 100% white. My sister tried to help with his other half but apart from teaching him some of the language, it hasn\u2019t been very successful. As my nephew got older it was pretty obvious he just wasn\u2019t interested. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s because of his father, not the culture itself. \n\nWell... my nephew\u2019s father finally reached out. To me though, not his child or the mother-to me. I told my sister who asked my nephew if he wanted to meet him and my nephew said yes. I went with.\n\nIt went okay... but his father has a whole new family back home and my nephew didn\u2019t take it well. Still, things were alright.\n\nThen he started asking my nephew if he could speak his language, if he liked any foods that are native to the culture, what he did for some holiday etc. My nephew told him that he can say some things \u201cno thanks to him\u201d but he doesn\u2019t like the food and he doesn\u2019t even know what holiday he\u2019s talking about.\n\nI noticed his father get agitated but he kept his cool. He asked him if he\u2019s ever been to the country before and my nephew laughed and said no. He asked if he wanted to and my nephew again said nope. He gave up once he realized how disconnected to the culture his son is and they decided to end the meeting. \n\nHis father asked me to stay behind for a minute and I did. And all he did was yell at me. He asked me why the hell I didn\u2019t make more of an effort to teach him about his culture etc. I was shocked and told him that this wouldn\u2019t even be a problem had he you know... stuck around. He wasn\u2019t having it though and said \u201cthis isn\u2019t about that, regardless of what I did, you practically erased a part of his identity. That is not right. It\u2019s about him, not me. You aren\u2019t punishing me by keeping him ignorant, you\u2019re punishing him.\u201d \n\nWhile my sister did teach him some of the language, she didn\u2019t do as much as she should\u2019ve. She stopped after a certain age too. I never did anything. I hate to admit and I know how important it is to teach kids about their cultures but it never crossed my mind considering my nephew was a happy kid despite everything. \n\nI\u2019m close to my nephew and now I feel really bad. He is very disconnected and it must suck or will suck eventually. Idk I\u2019m white in a white majority area, he\u2019s not, I won\u2019t get it, AITA?", "created_utc": 1681127289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hge1i/aita_for_not_helping_my_nephew_connect_with_his/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like your sister did her best under the circumstances. Forcing the issue probably wouldn't have helped. \n\nHowever, I think it would be great if she (and maybe you) sat down with your nephew and told him that you guys are there for him when/if ever he decides that he would like to connect with that side of his heritage. Just make it really clear that it doesn't have to be connected to his dad and wouldn't be viewed as any kind of betrayal. It kinda sounds like that is how your nephew is seeing it (and I think that's a natural loyalty to his mom, not anything that you guys put in his head), and making space in your lives for him to have that interest could be really good for him.

If he isn't then expressing an interest in learning about the culture then its coin flip whether or not doing so would be useful. As people have said, dad was not around to push the importance of said heritage.\n\nThis comes from someone raised white in a mostly white area with a heritage. I have now, decided i want to learn more about said culture, I feel like it would have been a chore and to be honest, like people were intentionally trying to tell me I was different and didn't fit if it was forced on me.", "He\u2019s questioning your parenting of his child. So not your fault.", "NTA by a mile. I have no idea why you think you would be based on this post. Never mind the fact that your nephew's dad is a deadbeat. Your nephew doesn't even live in the same country as his dad, and his mom is of a different ethnicity/culture. Of course, your nephew would lose interest.  \n\nMy mom tried to teach us her native language, but we never stuck to it since we didn't see the point (we didn't live in her native country, and there weren't many people who speak it where we live). \n\nThat being said, I think it's best if your nephew doesn't acknowledge his father, but again, that's up to him. Was the father that much of a delusional to think he would have an adult son all ready for him to just go to his home country and blend perfectly there? I wouldn't speak to him anymore. If he wants to speak to his son, he should pick up the phone and call him. \n\nYour nephew deserves better, and I'm sure you're doing your best."]}
