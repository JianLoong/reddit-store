You shared something confidential with your wife, it was aired publicly to others as a sort of 'soft' humiliation, and done so with people (mom) who will forward it to the other party (neighbor) from whom you successfully kept an awkward thing confidential for over a decade. \n\nWhile it's likely that the date you had with the neighbor girl is 'water under the bridge' ELEVEN YEARS LATER, your wife's decision to weaponize her knowledge of this against you is ghastly. You had every right to be upset, and you should seriously be on your guard against this behavior because it will happen again. Your wife is a grown woman who knows how to behave in a relationship- \"don't blab secret stuff\" is something we all learn in grade school. Betrayal of confidence is death to intimacy. And getting upset at you for not liking her behavior and claiming victimhood from your response is classic narcissism. The two of you need counseling, bad. This behavior will not get better on its own and sadly will only change if she wants it to change. \n\nSorry, bro. There's some tough times ahead.", "NTA\n\nAnd you know what to do here.

It sounds like she was completely unaware of why you were pissed and she\u2019s the one who had to eventually bring it up. By then she was irritated by the way you acted.

For all we know she just thinks it's fun banter.\n\nIt sounds like instead of the wife being some sort of evil manipulator that most commenters have decided OP and his wife have a big communication gap.  That's the problem, not this specific situation.", "Have you been in a relationship like this before? After years of shit like this you just stop trying to communicate your feelings because of the script flip. You start to feel like you aren't allowed to have feelings. The fall out of your partner being \"upset\" by your feelings becomes not worth it and something to avoid.\n\nGiven OPs 120-0 comment my guess is he mostly gave up on expressing his feelings a while ago and just holds everything in (is short with her) until he gets past it on his own."]}
