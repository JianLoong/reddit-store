You shared something confidential with your wife, it was aired publicly to others as a sort of 'soft' humiliation, and done so with people (mom) who will forward it to the other party (neighbor) from whom you successfully kept an awkward thing confidential for over a decade. \n\nWhile it's likely that the date you had with the neighbor girl is 'water under the bridge' ELEVEN YEARS LATER, your wife's decision to weaponize her knowledge of this against you is ghastly. You had every right to be upset, and you should seriously be on your guard against this behavior because it will happen again. Your wife is a grown woman who knows how to behave in a relationship- \"don't blab secret stuff\" is something we all learn in grade school. Betrayal of confidence is death to intimacy. And getting upset at you for not liking her behavior and claiming victimhood from your response is classic narcissism. The two of you need counseling, bad.

She is correct though, you should have pulled her aside for a conversation like an adult rather than pout and act like an AH towards her the rest of the day. It sounds like she was completely unaware of why you were pissed and she\u2019s the one who had to eventually bring it up. By then she was irritated by the way you acted.
