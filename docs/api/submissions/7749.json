No judgement here, but I'd suggest therapy.", "You are entitled to your privacy, but being unreachable if an emergency arises? That means no one can depend on you for emergency help. Please think carefully OP!", "You don't tell your own partner your whereabouts.  You don't share yourself with people who are closest to you.  You don't seem to care that your family worries about you.  You literally are hidden from everyone in your life except your partner because your partner needs to know where you live in order to live with you....\n\nI believe you've just defined what it means to be an AH.  Do you want to be lonely?  Is that your general preferred state?  Because you cannot have a close relationship with anyone if you don't open up and let people in.  You either genuinely don't want that, or are too scared to let people in.\n\nYTA because you do not give one flying fig if people worry about you (especially your parents), and that people want to be closer to you than you will allow.  And because you almost use it as a power card against those who love you.", "At this point it\u2019s less about you being TAH and more about your literal safety. It seems your family was worried and upset and (inappropriately) lashed out at you, because having someone being completely uncontactable while in another country is going to be worrisome.

Privacy is one thing, but this is taking it too far.  Why not get a divorce and go live out in the wilderness off the grid?", "Listen, I don't like people knowing stuff about me either, but my own partner? Yea, nah, that's extreme OP. So I'm gonna have to go YTA.", "YTA.  You didn't return repeated calls from your father for a week?  What if your mother was critically ill?  You didn't say you are NC, so I assume these people mean something to you, but the message you send when you refuse to share even the most basic parts of your life is that you don't care for them and they are more annoyance than family.", "YTA\n\nReasonable privacy and no social media presence is fine. Keeping your location,  job, etc, secret from loved ones is not normal. I suspect you have an untreated mental health concern.", "YTA. You have a right to your privacy but this is extreme and you can't be upset when the people who care about you exercise their right to be worried. Your dad was right to call the cops, it's what any reasonable person would have done. If you're going to go down this road be fully prepared to accept the consequences.", "YTA you need therapy\u2026", "YTA\nYour partner can\u2019t know where you are for work, or ask where you\u2019ve been when you\u2019re late? Are you serious? Even if they don\u2019t find an issue with this now, if you want anything serious (marriage or kids) they definitely will in the future. This is beyond privacy, it\u2019s dangerous and bizarre.", "If something happens to you, nobody will know where to look. They won't even know where to *start*. They'll ask your partner, the one who should be one of the ones most closest you and it'll look like this:\n\n\"What does he do for his job?\"\n\n*I don't know.*\n\n\"Where does he work?\"\n\n*I don't know.*\n\n\"What country could he have gone to?\n\n*I don't know.*\n\n\"What day did he say he'll be back?\"\n\n*I don't know.*\n\n\"Can you give us a photo of him so we can identify him?\"\n\n*I have no photos of him.* \n\nAnd, with your phone off most of the time, the police wouldn't even be able to track you to your last location before you went missing. In fact, it would look so suspicious they may suspect your partner because *who* doesn't know that basic information?\n\nI mean, it's your decision. But it's super weird and extreme.  But just because you have the right doesn't mean you're not .... YTA", "I understand privacy , I don't understand the excessive privacy however that doesn't make you an asshole it does make you a somewhat challenging relationship partner whether it be romantic or familial. I would ask myself why I need to be so excessively private? I know why I don't share things publicly but I share things with my family. I hope things work out with your father OP if you want them to.", "YTA \n\nWanting privacy is one thing, but you're pushing away the people who love and care about you and causing them anxiety. You're isolating yourself to an extreme while continuing to have relationships with others, and that makes them very one-sided. It's not healthy for them. Like others have said, you should deal with this in therapy.", "YTA. Privacy is one thing but not telling anyone where you are going, when you will return, or where you live is not normal. If you had a bad relationship or were NC with your family that would be different. It definitely gives off the vibe that you are involved in something very illegal.", ">Luckily I found a loving partner that knows and respects this therefore she won't take photos of me on social media, ask me where I go when I travel for work or where I am when I am late.\n\nNTA in general, but not sharing with your partner where your going to be or when you're going to be late is pretty shitty. \n\nAre you cheaing on her?  Do you have a second family?", "INFO: Are you consciously going low/no contact with your family? Cos if you're doing in on purpose and you have your reasons, then N T A. But if you think doing that is part of a normal and healthy relationship with your family, then Y T A. Emergencies do not only happen to you. They happen to other people as well, and they may need to reach you.", "Honestly I'm going to go with NAH.\n\nI too value my privacy and think everyone should be intentional about what info they share with others rather than seeing people as automatically owing info to others without a specific reason. Privacy is important and you've found a way that works for you.\n\nThat said, when I read that your partner didn't even know the DAY you would be returning from your trip (not the hour, fine whatever, but not even the day just the week???) I felt my anxiety skyrocket, and I don't even know you. I can only imagine how anxious and stressed the people who love you must sometimes be by the intensity with which you refuse them knowledge of your life. I'm glad your partner is on the same page with you, but the idea of someone you love and live with not having ANY idea where you are or when you're expected back (literally zero idea outside of \"sometime during x week OP'll be home\") is horrifying to me honestly.\n\nUltimately that doesn't matter. My opinion on your privacy needs are irrelevant. But I'm pretty comfortable with a LOT of privacy and if your expectations are making me nervous I have to imagine it makes a good chunk of the people in your life nervous as well. You may not care about that! In which case, carry on. But if you DO care about the impact your decisions may be having on family/friends' stress levels, it might be worth offering just *slightly* more information to people. The vacation convo might look like simply updating your voicemail when you are traveling abroad so that those who call looking for you receive some level of context (e.g. \"Hi, you've reached OP. I'm traveling right now and cannot check messages often, and will not be checking my messages until sometime after [insert a day of your choosing that doesn't even have to be your first day back home], so please don't leave urgent or time-sensitive voicemails. Thanks!) It might also look like at least letting your partner know \"I will be home sometime Thursday so if anything critical came up while I was gone, people can reach me Friday after I've slept.\" There is a point at which the tension you create by asking all your loved ones to operate around you like a giant logistical black hole of information is likely to start damaging those relationships. And again, maybe you're fine only having people in your life who can tolerate that tension! But maybe there are people you would genuinely be sad to lose and who are worth adjusted your privacy settings just a smidge.", "I\u2019ll say YTA. Not because you want privacy, but for being unreachable for weeks at a time. What if your partner had an emergency and couldn\u2019t get a hold of you for days or weeks? You should be able to trust your partner but it doesn\u2019t sound like you do at all.", "I can\u2019t really say you\u2019re an asshole because you are suffering from an untreated mental health condition. There\u2019s no beating around that bush, your attitude towards forming healthy emotional attachments with the people in your life is extreme. It\u2019s called Attachment Disorder. \n\nYou might be perfectly content with it, but if that\u2019s the case you need to be prepared for the people around you to fall away in response. Very few people are content with being close to someone who won\u2019t even tell them what they do for work or that they\u2019re going on vacation. \n\nSo I guess NAH, but man, you need therapy.", "I get it, but you should take a step back, and see things from his side as well.  By doing this to the family you claim to love, and have no issues with, you are essentially rejecting them or making them feel rejected.  Theu don't truly feel a part of your life, more like just figures in the background.  Sure you see them twice a year, and maybe you talk to them regularly, but my guess is most of the conversation is them talking with just basic I'm good, work is good, kind of things from you.  Your father is hurt, and feeling rejected.  If he's done nothing for you to reject him he's not going to understand why you shut him out so badly.", "YTA. Not telling your family your life details is weird when you're clearly in contact with them, but your own *partner* not knowing **where you are** and **when you're supposed to be home**??\n\nSafety alone, why would you not tell your *partner* where you're going and when exactly you're coming back?? Do you think you're immune to bad things happening to you? Forget your family, if you just didn't show up one day, how exactly would you partner go about reporting your missing?\n\n\"Oh no, I don't know when he eas supposed to be back, yeah, I don't know if he's been missing 1 day or 5, yeah yeah. No, I also don't know where he was, no, I don't\"\n\n*Who would take this person seriously??* Anyone would presume either you guys aren't, in fact, in a relationship, or you just ran away, because, **c'mon**.", "~~YTA.~~ NAH\n\nThere is a difference between being reserved and keeping to yourself and then being a recluse in your family. \n\nYour dad has a very valid point, he was trying to get a hold of you and that could be for a myriad of reasons and for you to be totally unreachable *is* worrying. And this could extend to your partner in the future. \n\nIf you don't want your parents to know anything about your life, you might as well just cut them out entirely. You can't have a relationship with someone you know nothing about.\n\nEdit: you're entitled to whatever level of privacy you want but that does come with impacts on your relationships with others.", "NTA.   Privacy is your right but you sound unhinged and cold AF.", "NTA. But, if something happens to you when you\u2019re away doing whatever. You\u2019re definitely going to screw yourself over, since nobody knows anything. May you always stay safe on your travels.", "NTA\nBut I am curious, growing up, was your family intrusive? Did they basically have to know everything and then went and blabbed about it to everyone? Were a lot of things in your life exposed to others that you had preferred remained private? While you are definitely entitled to whatever level of privacy you prefer, you seem to be having a trauma response, more so than just being a private person.", "NTA, in short. But I have questions.\n\nINFO: Does this standard apply both ways? Are you disinclined to know information about those you care about or your family? Does it bother you that if something happened to you, no one could help, given the excessively strict information diet?", "NAH here. but you are a bit extreme :) I can understand that your parents wants to be sure you are safe.", "NTA. But this doesn\u2019t sound like a healthy drawing of boundaries or treasuring one\u2019s privacy. It seems beyond what one would normally expect a very private person to do.
