Please think carefully OP!", "You don't tell your own partner your whereabouts.  You don't share yourself with people who are closest to you.  You don't seem to care that your family worries about you.  You literally are hidden from everyone in your life except your partner because your partner needs to know where you live in order to live with you....\n\nI believe you've just defined what it means to be an AH.  Do you want to be lonely?  Is that your general preferred state?  Because you cannot have a close relationship with anyone if you don't open up and let people in.  You either genuinely don't want that, or are too scared to let people in.\n\nYTA because you do not give one flying fig if people worry about you (especially your parents), and that people want to be closer to you than you will allow.  And because you almost use it as a power card against those who love you.", "At this point it\u2019s less about you being TAH and more about your literal safety.

You didn't say you are NC, so I assume these people mean something to you, but the message you send when you refuse to share even the most basic parts of your life is that you don't care for them and they are more annoyance than family.", "YTA\n\nReasonable privacy and no social media presence is fine. Keeping your location,  job, etc, secret from loved ones is not normal. I suspect you have an untreated mental health concern.", "YTA. You have a right to your privacy but this is extreme and you can't be upset when the people who care about you exercise their right to be worried.

YTA", "I understand privacy , I don't understand the excessive privacy however that doesn't make you an asshole it does make you a somewhat challenging relationship partner whether it be romantic or familial. I would ask myself why I need to be so excessively private? I know why I don't share things publicly but I share things with my family. I hope things work out with your father OP if you want them to.", "YTA \n\nWanting privacy is one thing, but you're pushing away the people who love and care about you and causing them anxiety. You're isolating yourself to an extreme while continuing to have relationships with others, and that makes them very one-sided. It's not healthy for them. Like others have said, you should deal with this in therapy.", "YTA. Privacy is one thing but not telling anyone where you are going, when you will return, or where you live is not normal. If you had a bad relationship or were NC with your family that would be different. It definitely gives off the vibe that you are involved in something very illegal.", ">Luckily I found a loving partner that knows and respects this therefore she won't take photos of me on social media, ask me where I go when I travel for work or where I am when I am late.\n\nNTA in general, but not sharing with your partner where your going to be or when you're going to be late is pretty shitty. \n\nAre you cheaing on her?  Do you have a second family?", "INFO: Are you consciously going low/no contact with your family? Cos if you're doing in on purpose and you have your reasons, then N T A. But if you think doing that is part of a normal and healthy relationship with your family, then Y T A. Emergencies do not only happen to you. They happen to other people as well, and they may need to reach you.", "Honestly I'm going to go with NAH.\n\nI too value my privacy and think everyone should be intentional about what info they share with others rather than seeing people as automatically owing info to others without a specific reason. Privacy is important and you've found a way that works for you.\n\nThat said, when I read that your partner didn't even know the DAY you would be returning from your trip (not the hour, fine whatever, but not even the day just the week???) I felt my anxiety skyrocket, and I don't even know you. I can only imagine how anxious and stressed the people who love you must sometimes be by the intensity with which you refuse them knowledge of your life. I'm glad your partner is on the same page with you, but the idea of someone you love and live with not having ANY idea where you are or when you're expected back (literally zero idea outside of \"sometime during x week OP'll be home\") is horrifying to me honestly.\n\nUltimately that doesn't matter. My opinion on your privacy needs are irrelevant. But I'm pretty comfortable with a LOT of privacy and if your expectations are making me nervous I have to imagine it makes a good chunk of the people in your life nervous as well. You may not care about that! In which case, carry on. But if you DO care about the impact your decisions may be having on family/friends' stress levels, it might be worth offering just *slightly* more information to people. The vacation convo might look like simply updating your voicemail when you are traveling abroad so that those who call looking for you receive some level of context (e.g. \"Hi, you've reached OP. I'm traveling right now and cannot check messages often, and will not be checking my messages until sometime after [insert a day of your choosing that doesn't even have to be your first day back home], so please don't leave urgent or time-sensitive voicemails. Thanks!) It might also look like at least letting your partner know \"I will be home sometime Thursday so if anything critical came up while I was gone, people can reach me Friday after I've slept.\" There is a point at which the tension you create by asking all your loved ones to operate around you like a giant logistical black hole of information is likely to start damaging those relationships. And again, maybe you're fine only having people in your life who can tolerate that tension! But maybe there are people you would genuinely be sad to lose and who are worth adjusted your privacy settings just a smidge.", "I\u2019ll say YTA. Not because you want privacy, but for being unreachable for weeks at a time. What if your partner had an emergency and couldn\u2019t get a hold of you for days or weeks? You should be able to trust your partner but it doesn\u2019t sound like you do at all.", "I can\u2019t really say you\u2019re an asshole because you are suffering from an untreated mental health condition. There\u2019s no beating around that bush, your attitude towards forming healthy emotional attachments with the people in your life is extreme. It\u2019s called Attachment Disorder. \n\nYou might be perfectly content with it, but if that\u2019s the case you need to be prepared for the people around you to fall away in response. Very few people are content with being close to someone who won\u2019t even tell them what they do for work or that they\u2019re going on vacation. \n\nSo I guess NAH, but man, you need therapy.", "I get it, but you should take a step back, and see things from his side as well.  By doing this to the family you claim to love, and have no issues with, you are essentially rejecting them or making them feel rejected.  Theu don't truly feel a part of your life, more like just figures in the background.  Sure you see them twice a year, and maybe you talk to them regularly, but my guess is most of the conversation is them talking with just basic I'm good, work is good, kind of things from you.  Your father is hurt, and feeling rejected.  If he's done nothing for you to reject him he's not going to understand why you shut him out so badly.", "YTA.

And this could extend to your partner in the future. \n\nIf you don't want your parents to know anything about your life, you might as well just cut them out entirely.

Privacy is your right but you sound unhinged and cold AF.", "NTA. But, if something happens to you when you\u2019re away doing whatever. You\u2019re definitely going to screw yourself over, since nobody knows anything. May you always stay safe on your travels.", "NTA\nBut I am curious, growing up, was your family intrusive? Did they basically have to know everything and then went and blabbed about it to everyone? Were a lot of things in your life exposed to others that you had preferred remained private? While you are definitely entitled to whatever level of privacy you prefer, you seem to be having a trauma response, more so than just being a private person.", "NTA, in short. But I have questions.\n\nINFO: Does this standard apply both ways? Are you disinclined to know information about those you care about or your family? Does it bother you that if something happened to you, no one could help, given the excessively strict information diet?", "NAH here. but you are a bit extreme :) I can understand that your parents wants to be sure you are safe.", "NTA.

No, HE may not be able to do anything in the event of an emergency, but he will at least know where to tell authorities to start looking.

You run into a mutual acquaintance while traveling, now they may know your job or where you go for work. \n\nThis privacy isn\u2019t keeping you safe OP.

They're even hiding from their partner to an extent. Their partner didn't know where they were while away. They also did not know when to expect op home - aside from the week, which is arguably a vague period of time. Also from the way it reads to me I have to question if ops partner even knows what op does for a living.. what op isn't realizing is they're also preventing others from opening up to them.

What if there was a death?...", "This is why I also came down on the YTA side after thinking about it in the shower. I was originally leaning N A H as it just seemed like people having different expectations (albeit one person\u2019s expectations were bizarre). But ultimately, op must know that they have unbelievably extreme views on this that are not shared or understood by the general population. It\u2019s an AH move to be SO indifferent to the people who love you and care about your well-being and do nothing to mitigate their concern or communicate. Either have a relationship with your family or don\u2019t, but OP must KNOW that this is cruel and comes across as uncaring to others at best and hostile at worst.", "Imagine how much scrutiny she would be under because how the hell could she not know those things... lord.", "Well in fairness, it sounds like he didn\u2019t answer the phone because it was off/he didn\u2019t know he was called.

It\u2019s not even close to not being weird.", "Nope, none of that", "In this case Im curious exactly what that impact would be. \n\nBecause: what was so damn important it couldnt wait a week? I dont see OP saying anything about deaths in the family, extreme medical emergencies...\n\nSo, again, what was so important that the father just had to throw a fit because he couldnt talk to his adult son for another few days?\n\nSee, I dont feel OP is the one making the 'impact' here.

If he wants to be invisible, might as well become invisible. I don't see the point of having any relationships if he can't talk to anyone and have no one know anything about him.
