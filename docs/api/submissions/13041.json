We used to be a very lovely close family. The kids grew up and left for college and understandably, we got to see them much less frequently than before.\n\nWith that being said, Sam always comes back home with his family for Christmas, our birthdays, just randomly and calls us regularly, updates us on his life and etc. We have a very close relationship with his kids and wife as well. \n\nHanna, is a whole different story. She hasn't really paid much of an attention to us since she left for college. Every time I try to contact her she says she is busy with work, and she travels all over the world with her family. She hasn't come to see us once even since covid. I mean I hear more from her wife (28F - Maeve) than I do from her directly and even that is limited to a few pictures of their son (3) every now and then.\n\nMy husband and I were visiting the city Hanna lives in, which is quite far away from our own. We actually went there to possibly see her if she was available. I called Maeve and after a few minutes she called to say we were set for dinner. We had a hotel room and just wanted to see Hanna for dinner one day while we were there.\n\nWe went out tp dinner and saw Hanna's family. She took us out to a very fancy restaurant and didn't let us pay even though we insisted we wanted it to be our treat. She took us back to their house for the night, and said we could stay.\n\nWhen she was showing us the room, she told my husband and I that we should have called her and directly asked her for an appropriate time because she had to cancel a very important meeting and move her entire schedule to accomodate this night.\n\nWe explained that we had to do this because she never came to see us unlike Sam and was barely available when we called her phone. She called us ridiculous and said we should have gone to Sam's instead. She left early the next morning and Maeve has been kind of distant since the incident.\n\nWere we wrong to go there unannounced?", "created_utc": 1679606406, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zxt9g/aita_for_visiting_my_daughter_without_previous/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may not know what it is, but you're not going to solve this by ignoring the boundaries she's clearly trying to set. Having someone show up suddenly in your town would be very off-putting to most people. And then you specifically told her that you did it intentionally because you knew you wouldn't be able to see her otherwise, which is a pretty creepy thing to say! \n\nI think you should apologize and let her determine any future visits. This isn't something you can bulldoze your way through. But if your daughter got distant as soon as she legally could, there's definitely some story there.", "Hmmm.  Just regarding the question of are you a TA for visiting without notice - yes, absolutely YTA.  That\u2019s not ok, and that you did so because you were afraid if you told her she\u2019d put you off -sad, but just showing up with no notice isn\u2019t the way to solve your closeness issue.  It\u2019s rude, and now she\u2019s going to be even more distant.  My kid is only 3 hours away, I would never just drop in on him.  \n\nI feel like OP is leaving something out.  I\u2019d love to hear from Hanna because it sounds like she left for college and went LC with her parents - people don\u2019t do that for no reason.  Hanna has a reason for being LC.  Either the OP is oblivious, which is really sad; or she knows, thinks its silly and wants to ignore it; or just doesn\u2019t want to share the reason with hundreds of thousands of strangers (perfectly valid, actually) but whatever the reason, there\u2019s more going on here.", "Hanna TOLD YOU she didn't like your behavior. And you're still posting here asking for opinions? And you wonder why she has little contact with you! You obviously don't treat her with the respect she deserves, of course she distances herself now. YTA, learn how to listen.", "\"My daughter very clearly doesn't want to see us. Am I an asshole for showing up unannounced in spite of this incredibly obvious fact?\"\n\nYes.\n\nYTA \n\nRead the room, lady.", "YTA\n\nJust showing up and expecting people to drop everything to accommodate you is **rude**.  It was rude to just drop in on your daughter and her family and expect them to change all their plans for you, but despite that, they still dealt with all the inconvenience you caused in order to see you and treated you very well.\n\nAll your daughter asked was that next time you plan ahead with her so that you can make plans at a time that works well for both sides.  That's hardly an unreasonable request.  Many people consider that basic social decency.  \n\nBut with how you responded to her request that you show more respect to her, her family, and their schedule, it's no wonder why she has so little to do with you.  You should have just apologized, thanked her for dropping everything, and agreed next time to plan ahead.  Instead, you took no responsibility for the inconvenience you caused her/her family and instead tried to place the blame on *her* for your rudeness.  I wouldn't want to socialize with you much either.", "YTA Have you considered that maybe there is a reason that Hannah doesn\u2019t want to see you? Most people don\u2019t cut out family unless they have a very good reason. Have you tried asking her and correcting any behaviors she\u2019s asked you to correct?", "YTA- showing up unannounced is always rude, always. Doesn't matter if its your daughter. I feel for you that you want time with her, but the appropriate thing to do would have called before your trip and said something like \"hey we're going to be in your area, do you want to do something?\"", "Honestly it DOES (edit typo) sound like Hanna is pretty busy with her work schedule. And you shouldn't have compared her availability to Sam's - there might be some issues with favoritism that you'll want to avoid bringing up.\n\nI'd suggest honoring Hanna's \"busyness\" - apologize for just dropping in, but more importantly, ask if you can schedule time together. Like give her a range or dates within which you can come see her or she can come visit whichever is more convenient and see if any work for her.\n\nYou might have put Maeve in an awkward position between you and Hanna, so I'd apologize to her if that was the case - she'll appreciate it even if she says an apology isn't necessary.\n\nEDIT: Just reread you final AITA question. Yes, YTA for going there unannounced. You need to respect her time. I had listed N.A.H. previously focusing more on your behavior on the visit. Sorry.", "YTA\n\nSome people have busy lives.  Some people don't like unexpected disruptions.  Some people have other reasons for being distant.  By dropping by unannounced, you haven't given her the chance to express when she has time to meet you.  Instead, you expect her to conform to your schedule regardless of what she had going on.  It is extremely rude and inconsiderate of you.", "INFO: Come on now, be honest. Why did your daughter go low contact? This post has missing missing reasons written all over it.", "YTA. You can\u2019t act pushy and then be surprised you pushed her away. Traveling a lot doesn\u2019t come cheap, it sounds like she works hard to be very successful.

It would have been better to say you would be in town on X date and would like to get together for dinner (or lunch or coffee or a chat or whatever) and give her time to plan her schedule or suggest an alternate date.\n\nUsing her brother's visits as an excuse to drop in unannounced is utter BS.  The 2 are completely unrelated.  And maybe she has her reasons for being distant.  Probably better to find that out than showing up unannounced at the front door.", "YTA. You placed Hanna in an awkward situation and possibly jeopardized her career. You knew you would be traveling to the city Hanna lives in, you could have easily called her departure or at the very least texted her.

You don't have a right to see her.\n\n>She hasn't come to see us once even since covid.\n\nYou do understand that the covid situation is an ongoing one, do you not?

You planned to force Hanna to spend time with you and deny her financial agency?", "YTA. My inlaws pull this all the time. They tell us when they're coming to town and what dates we should expect to make plans with them. Its fucking glorious to tell them NO when they think our lives will revolve around a command performance at the date and time of their choosing. My husband has a non-traditional job and our kid is busy so they're more likely than not to be told their fantasy that they can show up barely announced on a schedule that suits them while we clamor for their company is not possible. We will not change plans for them. My husband's brother does revolve his life around their parents and their visits. Doesn't bother us at all, but we're not his brother.", "YTA. Maybe it\u2019s time to explore why she\u2019s distant and never wants to see you. Also, brining the other sibling into it is an AH move, like comparing children.

You could have AT THE VERY LEAST gotten a hotel room.", "It doesn\u2019t matter what anyone on Reddit says because your daughter has told you how she feels.\nMy own mother received encouragement from her friends to drop by unannounced on multiple occasions, more people told her to do it rather than my lone voice explaining that it wasn\u2019t appropriate. Majority didn\u2019t rule and our relationship is worse now than it was before.", "I don't think it was about dropping in. Her comment suggests she feels compared to Sam.

OP probably knew Hanna would say no, so got Maeve to set it up since DiL seems to want to give OP a chance.  That seems to be dead now though.  \n\nAnyway, there's a lot of missing missing reasons here.  Who knows what they are, could be homophobia (past or present), could be narcissism, could be incessant comparing the siblings?  It's just such a blank slate that invites all sorts of guesses.", "YTA. You remind me of my parents. Your daughter told you how she felt about your behaviour. Instead of accepting and validating her feelings you came onto reddit to ask if you were justified in your actions. YOUR DAUGHTER ALREADY COMMUNICATED HOW SHE FELT AND YOU STILL IGNORED HER!", "YTA if your sole purpose was to get her to see you.  I can't stand when my own MIL tries to pull shit like this instead of being transparent. Probably explains why she doesn't make the effort to see you much.", "> My husband and I were visiting the city Hanna lives in, which is quite far away from our own. We actually went there to possibly see her if she was available. \n\nSo you just showed up and decided to impose yourselves instead of, I don't know, calling first?\n\nYTA", "Yep, you were wrong and YTA. Keep pushing and you will not see your daughter at all.", ">We explained that we had to do this because she never came to see us unlike Sam and was barely available when we called her phone. She called us ridiculous and said we should have gone to Sam's instead. \n\nBingo! on the \"golden child\" assessment.  \"Unlike Sam\"?  What does her brother's visiting and calling his parents have to do with her not calling and visiting them?  She has clearly spent her life not being as good as Sam in their eyes and wants nothing to do with them because of it.  As a scapegoat myself, I recognized these parents immediately.  \"We had to do this \\[because you suck, other child\\]\" -  this whole post gave me shivers down my spine.", "Exactly!"]}
