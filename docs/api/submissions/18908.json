It gives me weird vibes that this is more of a \u201cmain character\u201d syndrome which most teenagers have and there is more to the story.\n\n\nI think it is interesting that even your dad wants you to apologize. \n\n\nBut anyway, there is a long history here that is probably pretty complicated. If I was your dad and Amy, this post would be a wake up call that you may benefit from therapy to work on a lot of issues stemming from the divorce, issues with your mom, and issues with your sister.

She is your half sister, and there\u2019s a lot of hostility there as well. It was an AH move to refer to your dad\u2019s new gf as your mom, and it was done to hurt your mom. Only so much can be chalked up to teenage drama and attitude. The apathy towards sister and mom is extreme. \nHowever. Your mother expects you to cancel plans to babysit a special needs child, as a child yourself. That\u2019s not fair. \nI feel like family therapy might be the solution, if only to force you to talk it out.", "Uff this one is hard. NTA for not wanting to babysit your sister, but your dad was right when he said you were disrespectful. You are letting your anger get the better of you and lashing out. If your mom and sister are rude you don't need to be just as rude.\n\nTalk to your dad, it's not right if your mother uses you for childcare when you are there.

I have seen mild cases to severe cases.", "DO NOT DO THIS.  Calls to CPS are for when kids are in danger.  Every minute they devote to anything else means a kid who desperately needs help is not getting it.   None of this fits the legal definition of abuse or neglect, so a call like this just wastes previous staff time and puts other kids in danger.", "Talk about the extreme and wasting resources.

Set dad down and explain that you want to go back to court and end visitation.  If you want your dad to respect your voice, you\u2019re gonna have to keep your cool and talk with dad as a young adult.", "Oh yeah, I totally know that.\n\nBut the way OP is describing it it seems like a case where the mother's child might need more help. And either way, in the edit she said she's at the kid's beck and call 24/7.

Personally, I don\u2019t think what you said was harsh. If the egg donor is truly so upset that you consider someone else to be your mom, she has no one to blame but herself. Yes, her daughter is not to blame, but neither are you. Her daughter is hers and Mark\u2019s. There are several commenters here who claim that you are old enough to watch a sibling, but regardless of age or ability, she is NEVER your responsibility. She\u2019s not your kid. I\u2019m not sure about how the courts work where you live, but please have a serious discussion with Amy and your dad. Hopefully they will see that your \u201charshness\u201d was not unprovoked and that your egg donor is mistreating both you and her daughter. \n\nAgain, I also have a narcissistic egg donor. I haven\u2019t spoken to her in years (a good thing for me!). If your relationship with her is important to you, please express that to her. If it is to her as well, you can try to move forward towards healthier interactions. And if not, save yourself some pain and frustration. You\u2019re fifteen.

I do not think you are an AH, but I do think you could have given your refusal in a manner that was more calm.  kt", "NTA. I was in a similar situation and I wish I had talked to a school administrator about it. Most if not all divorces with minor children have a designated \"friend of the court\" to ensure that the childs wellbeing is taken care of. When my parents were divorcing, my friend of the court visited my school to talk to me about where I wanted to live. Go to whichever school administrator you trust (principal, vice principal, guidance counselor, nurse, whomever), tell them you are being forced to care for your disabled and sometimes violent sister without breaks or supervision, and ask for help speaking with whoever was your friend of the court or the judge who was on your custody case so you can live with your dad.  School officials are required by law to notify authorities if they suspect or get reports of abuse or neglect. Theyre called mandatory reporters. If for some crazy reason they don't help you, Google the number for child services in your city or state and call yourself. \n\nAnd if you are TA and are overreacting or acting out, the administrator or court will help figure that out. Though, it more sounds like you're lashing out because your situation is bad, and that's understandable, especially as a teenager. \n\nThis is all very adult, and I'm sorry you have to go through this. But, you'll feel better once you speak out. My friend of the court sent me to live with my abusive parent because I said nothing and there were no visible signs.
