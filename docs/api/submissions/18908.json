And yell? I'd ask if I can cancel visitations due to neglect and mistreatment.", "I agree with others that you could\u2019ve handled that better. But from what I\u2019m reading, she went off on you for reasonably stating you had plans. I think you considering your dads gf as more of a mother is valid but your response could\u2019ve been handled better. Overall though, NTA", "NTA. Yes you were harsh and gave her a reality check that's going to hurt her, but it is the truth. Being half siblings means nothing if you two don't have a sibling bond, so you're right her daughter is not your sister. The same way you don't have a strong parent bond with her as a mother, but you do with your step mom. Not only that but your mom only has weekends with you and instead of wanting to spend that time together she's trying to use you as a free baby sitter.", "I\u2019m going with NTA, though this one is hard.\n\nWhat you said was very harsh, even if you feel it is true.  But you are not obligated to watch your sister.  \n\nMy biggest piece of advice here would be to talk to your dad, let him know that you no longer want to go to your mom\u2019s.  At 15, you a legally allowed to decide where you live (in the US) you just have to tell the judge.", "Ok. Just to be clear: on her court appointed weekend, she wants to use you for free babysitting so she can go on a date with her husband? NTA\u2026 but check your tone!", "I'm confused. If you're only with her on weekend's, why did you have plans to go out to dinner with your Dad and Amy?", "You know you\u2019re the age to choose which parent you live with 100% NTA", "NTA. I'm sorry you're going through this. Hugs.", "NTA. Why is it that your mother isn't taking care of you when it's her turn for custody and wants you to take care of your sister as well? You are both underage, she should be watching both of you not you watching your sister for her. What you said was harsh, but ultimately it is how you feel.", "NTA for watching the half-sister, but you know what you did. Was it right? Was it wrong? Who can say?", "YTA because of what you said about your sister. It was cruel. Not TA for not wanting to watch your sister when you had other plans. She is her parents problem, not yours.\n\nEdit: clarified sister", "NTA for not wanting to babysit when you have prior commitments buuuut YTA because her daughter is ABSOLUTELY your half-sister and not responsible for her parents' actions. You're throwing away a possible relationship with her for reasons beyond her control and this could turn into a relationship you value very much in the future. If your sister was an adult and an asshole, sure, you have every right to not make an effort towards her. But she sounds like a kid, and you are too. As someone with half siblings, I want to caution you from writing off your relationship with her just because you hate your mom and her boyfriend. It isn't your sister's fault.", "Well, NTA, but a bit harsh.  It wouldn\u2019t kill you to apologize for what you said. \n\nFYI, court orders are for the parents, not the child.  My oldest son rode his bike all the way from his dads house to mine in the middle of the night when he was your age and never went back. I tried to coax him to mend the relationship,  but he wasn\u2019t interested, and no court would force him.", "Hmmm...firstly, whether you like it or not, this child is your sister. Don't blame her for the weird family dynamics. Second, I note people picked up on your mother going out for dinner but why in the blue fuck are your dad and steppie having you for dinner on a court appointed weekend for your other parent? It sounds like you're stuck right in the middle of something. Firstly,  stop listening to the stories about who's to blame over the divorce. I'm sure there are three sides. Don't blame your sister. She's 10. But NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Why are they making plans during the weekend when they're supposed to be together? All parties, the \"mom\" and Mark but also the dad and Amy? Can't they have dinners any other time?

You're the child, not the babysitter. You really shouldn't be in charge of the other child, it's neglect on Egg donor's part.", "NTA. \n\nWere you harsh? Yes. But I absolutely understand why you said what you said. Amy is kind and loving, your mother is entitled and rude. Moreover, you\u2019re a kid, not a babysitter. Even if your sister was well behaved and perfectly abled, I\u2019d be saying that. But she\u2019s not. She\u2019s aggressive, combative, and needs round the clock care. Sounds like she\u2019d be a handful for a qualified professional, of which you are not. \n\nPlease talk to your dad and Amy. Or just Amy, if you feel more comfortable with her (she certainly would have less love/respect/time for your mother). Tell her what weekends with egg donor is like. Tell her how often your mother/Mark are in the house. Tell her what your sister is like when it\u2019s just you looking after her. Ask her if you can talk to a lawyer about not going back. There\u2019s a chance that they\u2019re not seeing the whole picture (aka you being a full time weekend care nurse) and would change their stance on your visitation if they knew more.", "Call cps on your mum for abandoned minors and one with needs.

Tell him you want your chance to speak up in court.", "Don't know if it's changed but in California in court for the beginning of a custody battle I was told by a judge that it was 16 when a child could decide which parent and even then it was up to the judge.

Different states have different laws.", "As someone from SF,  family code 3042 has been standard since 2011. And California AB 1050 in 2012 adds that the judge has to allow any 14 year old who wishes to address the court regarding their custody.", "Yeah this surprise \"date night\" feels like she found out about the special occasion and wanted to throw a monkey wrench into the works.\n\nShe asked for the comparison when I do not doubt she understands the strain in your relationship.\n\nNTA", "Quite silly to tell a 15 year old to grow up! OP please ignore this person they are an internet bully hiding behind their keyboard. OP you are NTA, family is hard sometimes and it is not okay for your mom to use you a babysitter. I understand not having a bond to half siblings, I have two that I do not consider family. They are just my dad's kids nothing to me. On the other I have two brothers that my mom had with my stepdad. I will never say they are not my real brothers because they are, full stop! You can choose who you consider your family as odd as that seems.\n\nMaybe when you are older you will change your feelings about your mom's other child or maybe you wont, but at the end of the day that is your choice to make. I am sorry that you are going through such a hard time, sending you support!"]}
