And yell? I'd ask if I can cancel visitations due to neglect and mistreatment.", "I agree with others that you could\u2019ve handled that better. But from what I\u2019m reading, she went off on you for reasonably stating you had plans. I think you considering your dads gf as more of a mother is valid but your response could\u2019ve been handled better. Overall though, NTA", "NTA. Yes you were harsh and gave her a reality check that's going to hurt her, but it is the truth. Being half siblings means nothing if you two don't have a sibling bond, so you're right her daughter is not your sister. The same way you don't have a strong parent bond with her as a mother, but you do with your step mom. Not only that but your mom only has weekends with you and instead of wanting to spend that time together she's trying to use you as a free baby sitter.", "I\u2019m going with NTA, though this one is hard.\n\nWhat you said was very harsh, even if you feel it is true.  But you are not obligated to watch your sister.  \n\nMy biggest piece of advice here would be to talk to your dad, let him know that you no longer want to go to your mom\u2019s.  At 15, you a legally allowed to decide where you live (in the US) you just have to tell the judge.", "Ok. Just to be clear: on her court appointed weekend, she wants to use you for free babysitting so she can go on a date with her husband? NTA\u2026 but check your tone!", "I'm confused. If you're only with her on weekend's, why did you have plans to go out to dinner with your Dad and Amy?", "You know you\u2019re the age to choose which parent you live with 100% NTA", "NTA. I'm sorry you're going through this. Hugs.", "NTA. Why is it that your mother isn't taking care of you when it's her turn for custody and wants you to take care of your sister as well? You are both underage, she should be watching both of you not you watching your sister for her. What you said was harsh, but ultimately it is how you feel.", "NTA for watching the half-sister, but you know what you did. Was it right? Was it wrong? Who can say?", "YTA because of what you said about your sister. It was cruel. Not TA for not wanting to watch your sister when you had other plans. She is her parents problem, not yours.\n\nEdit: clarified sister", "NTA for not wanting to babysit when you have prior commitments buuuut YTA because her daughter is ABSOLUTELY your half-sister and not responsible for her parents' actions. You're throwing away a possible relationship with her for reasons beyond her control and this could turn into a relationship you value very much in the future. If your sister was an adult and an asshole, sure, you have every right to not make an effort towards her. But she sounds like a kid, and you are too. As someone with half siblings, I want to caution you from writing off your relationship with her just because you hate your mom and her boyfriend. It isn't your sister's fault.", "Well, NTA, but a bit harsh.  It wouldn\u2019t kill you to apologize for what you said. \n\nFYI, court orders are for the parents, not the child.  My oldest son rode his bike all the way from his dads house to mine in the middle of the night when he was your age and never went back. I tried to coax him to mend the relationship,  but he wasn\u2019t interested, and no court would force him.", "Hmmm...firstly, whether you like it or not, this child is your sister. Don't blame her for the weird family dynamics. Second, I note people picked up on your mother going out for dinner but why in the blue fuck are your dad and steppie having you for dinner on a court appointed weekend for your other parent? It sounds like you're stuck right in the middle of something. Firstly,  stop listening to the stories about who's to blame over the divorce. I'm sure there are three sides. Don't blame your sister.

But I absolutely understand why you said what you said. Amy is kind and loving, your mother is entitled and rude. Moreover, you\u2019re a kid, not a babysitter. Even if your sister was well behaved and perfectly abled, I\u2019d be saying that. But she\u2019s not. She\u2019s aggressive, combative, and needs round the clock care. Sounds like she\u2019d be a handful for a qualified professional, of which you are not. \n\nPlease talk to your dad and Amy. Or just Amy, if you feel more comfortable with her (she certainly would have less love/respect/time for your mother). Tell her what weekends with egg donor are like. Tell her how often your mother/Mark are in the house. Tell her what your sister is like when it\u2019s just you looking after her. Ask her if you can talk to a lawyer about not going back. There\u2019s a chance that they\u2019re not seeing the whole picture (aka you being a full time weekend care nurse) and would change their stance on your visitation if they knew more.", "Call cps on your mum for abandoned minors and one with needs.

OP please ignore this person they are an internet bully hiding behind their keyboard. OP you are NTA, family is hard sometimes and it is not okay for your mom to use you a babysitter. I understand not having a bond to half siblings, I have two that I do not consider family. They are just my dad's kids nothing to me. On the other I have two brothers that my mom had with my stepdad. I will never say they are not my real brothers because they are, full stop! You can choose who you consider your family as odd as that seems.\n\nMaybe when you are older you will change your feelings about your mom's other child or maybe you wont, but at the end of the day that is your choice to make.

It's also very telling that they waited until the weekend to go out. \n\nNarcissistic people don't care about what is said about them. They use it as a tool to guilt the person who stood up to them. But I do hope that she realizes that your relationship with your dad's gf, and wants to improve your relationship.\n\nWhile I don't believe that you should have to apologize, you might have to, in order to keep the peace. (Unfortunately. People believe blood relatives are excused from their behavior.)\n\nI would highly suggest speaking with your father about getting weekends removed. You're old enough. Talking out your frustrations and problems with him now and getting away from toxic people now will benefit you in the long run. Maybe even counseling to discuss those issues with your mom.", "You're being used as a free live-in baby-sitter instead of being treated as a beloved daughter.  Talk to you dad about this.

You\u2019re not winning any points in calling your mom narcissistic but then going on about how your half sister isn\u2019t your sister. It also feels like you didn\u2019t share your plans for dinner with your mom either so there is a lack of communication.\n\n\nI feel like this is a long, complicated history that is not adequately going to be represented and seeking validation on the internet seems to be kinda narcissistic to me as this post feels like it is lacking empathy. It gives me weird vibes that this is more of a \u201cmain character\u201d syndrome which most teenagers have and there is more to the story.\n\n\nI think it is interesting that even your dad wants you to apologize. \n\n\nBut anyway, there is a long history here that is probably pretty complicated. If I was your dad and Amy, this post would be a wake up call that you may benefit from therapy to work on a lot of issues stemming from the divorce, issues with your mom, and issues with your sister. The divorce was a long time ago and both parents failed in helping you cope with the divorce if you are still bitter about it even though it probably happened over a decade ago.", "ESH.  Your sister is your sister.  Frankly, she needs to have a sister.  She has the same crappy narcissist mother you do, but a different crappier father.  Don't be a jerk to your sister just because you're mad at your mother.\n\nObviously, you can choose not to babysit, and your mother should plan better, since you may have plans.  She is acting entitled to your domestic labor.", "love how she got demoted from being biological mother to egg donor \ud83d\ude2d", "You're only 15 OP but you were very harsh about your sister.", "Your egg donor is your mother. Amy is not. So call Amy your mom in front of your real mom is just wrong. Saying that, you already had plans, your mother should request a babysitter if she wanted to go out.  If she was sick, or had to work then that would be different, but to go out....her child her responsabilty. Now...Even that your parent had a nasty divorce she is your mom, so try not to take sides. If you prefer to stay with your father thats ok, but try to threat your mother with kindness.", "ESH. This is a lot to unpack. You clearly don\u2019t like your mother, and are disrespectful to her. She is your half sister, and there\u2019s a lot of hostility there as well. It was an AH move to refer to your dad\u2019s new gf as your mom, and it was done to hurt your mom. Only so much can be chalked up to teenage drama and attitude. The apathy towards sister and mom is extreme. \nHowever. Your mother expects you to cancel plans to babysit a special needs child, as a child yourself. That\u2019s not fair. \nI feel like family therapy might be the solution, if only to force you to talk it out.", "Uff this one is hard. NTA for not wanting to babysit your sister, but your dad was right when he said you were disrespectful. You are letting your anger get the better of you and lashing out. If your mom and sister are rude you don't need to be just as rude.\n\nTalk to your dad, it's not right if your mother uses you for childcare when you are there.  Also depending on where you live you might not have to be made to visit your mother for much longer. Usually after 16 you might have more of a say on visiting your mother. Good luck OP", "Nta.\nYou don't have to consider your mom's daughter your sister.", ">She started yelling and me and saying i was selfish for prioritizing my dads gf over my sister.\n\nAll while the mom is prioritizing the bf over both the kids.", "Just curious but were you never left alone as a teenager? I could manage myself when I was 11. I babysat when I was 15. Were you not mature enough at 15 to watch other kids? Were you so immature that you needed constant supervision at 15?", "No. It's not the job of an actual child to check their tone when being abused by an adult.", "CP can vary greatly. I have seen mild cases to severe cases.", "DO NOT DO THIS.  Calls to CPS are for when kids are in danger.  Every minute they devote to anything else means a kid who desperately needs help is not getting it.   None of this fits the legal definition of abuse or neglect, so a call like this just wastes previous staff time and puts other kids in danger.", "Talk about the extreme and wasting resources. She was asked to babysit, which she didn\u2019t do as apparently she went to dinner, and you want her to cry about being forced into a caretaker role? \n\n\nIf OP calls CPS like you suggest, it would come off as OP is very immature.", "A whole lot of people here are saying that an ACTUAL CHILD is part of the problem because she's being insufficiently polite to her borderline abusive non-custodial parent, and it's not okay. Geez.", "In ga, as soon as the child turns 14, they can choose to refuse visitation.", "But you can make the visits a living hell for the other parent", "Was just about to say this, same goes for Kansas", "In the edit op says they spend the whole time at their house caring for the sister, with no breaks. That\u2019s called parentification and has serious long term mental health consequences for the older sibling who misses out on their childhood.", "Nta. It\u2019s time you say dad down and let him know what life is like at moms. Maybe he doesn\u2019t realize that every time you\u2019re there she turns you into a caregiver for her daughter.  Set dad down and explain that you want to go back to court and end visitation.  If you want your dad to respect your voice, you\u2019re gonna have to keep your cool and talk with dad as a young adult.", "Oh yeah, I totally know that.\n\nBut the way OP is describing it it seems like a case where the mother's child might need more help. And either way, in the edit she said she's at the kid's beck and call 24/7. Like even if the kid didn't have cerebral palsy she's still being parentified.", "Yeah, you can reschedule a birthday dinner.  Your dad could have also worked out a way to swap days with your mom.  This all could have been avoided with civility and better communication.", "Yep, Californian divorced mum with a law degree (I don't use it) - it's 14. The judge still gets to rule, but the child can tell the court what they want and why they want it.", "Why did they plan it on your mom\u2019s time? Why did they not ask your mother about whether it was okay to take you? Asking her would have been respectful thing to do as it is her time. \n\n\nThis weekend time isn\u2019t a new thing. I\u2019m guessing the parenting plans have been in place for a long time if you have a ten year old half sister.\n\n\nThere is a lot of issues going on here.", "Your dad shares some blame here because the reservation should have been made for after your normal dropoff time.\n\nBut you are NTA."]}
