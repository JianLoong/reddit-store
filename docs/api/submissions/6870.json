But sometimes people say mean things in the moment when really angry. If this sort of thing becomes a pattern, I\u2019d end it. But calling a kid who was clearly doing something very frustrating a name once? I think while wrong, it\u2019s forgivable and I\u2019ve heard of step parents doing far worse to kids who deserved much less.\n\nIs your fianc\u00e9 willing to apologize to him? Is he remorseful? And if he is \u201cdone\u201d with your kid, how is he going to continue to be your fianc\u00e9? I couldn\u2019t date a man with kids at all (unless they were like over 15) so my initial gut reaction is to not blame him for losing his cool because I couldn't imagine having to constantly endure that kind of behavior. I\u2019d like to think I wouldn\u2019t call a kid a name, but imagining myself in that situation, if that is how he is 95% of the time? Wow, idk\u2026I snapped and said some mean-ass shit to my husband when he was alive. But dealing with an alcoholic is a lot. And lots of people used to tell me they literally don't understand how I allowed myself to endure the sort of tantrums he used to have and they were surprised the ONLY thing I did was snap and say some mean shit after dealing with hours worth of tantrums from a grown man literally acting like a toddler. \n\nReddit is going to be black and white with it: \u201cno, it\u2019s not okay to call a child names, he is toxic, end it.\u201d But the truth is: humans aren\u2019t perfect and when constantly living in stressful situations, sometimes they do or say things that \u201caren\u2019t okay.\u201d Doesn't mean you have to throw out the whole human, and if you do, prepare to serial date, because most people have flaws and \"cross the line\" at some point, especially if they are going to be constantly exposed to high stress situations (like yours). Some people would write me off for the mean things I said to my late husband, but I've been with my current boyfriend for almost 3.5 years and we've had a few arguments, but nothing as heated as things with my late husband were. But the black and white \"mental health\" types would say: you're capable of verbal abuse, you are in the \"bad\" category, it's only a matter of time before you mistreat your current BF. Which I know is crap, and people are almost always more gray than black and white.\n\nOf course the severity of the action matters, if he starts beating your kid out of anger, yeah, leave then. BUT I say calling a kid a name once should be forgiven if he acknowledges it\u2019s wrong and wants to push forward with solutions to getting your kid\u2019s bad behaviors under control. And has a plan for removing himself from the situation so he doesn't repeat this behavior.\n\nOthers probably won\u2019t agree with this. But my opinion is: yes, he is wrong here, for what he did (calling him a curse word to his face). But I understand why he was angry. Your kid is only nice 5% of time time? That sounds like a fucking nightmare and exhausting to deal with on the daily. And while you can tolerate it more, that is because you're his mother and have that oxytocin bond giving you an extra boost. He doesn't have that. So remember, MOST other people are going to get irritated having to deal with an energy-filled child misbehaving 95% of the time. And a lot of people may snap and do or say things that are objectively not acceptable at some point. As long as they acknowledge it was wrong and work on being better, I think you should consider forgiving him. But then again, you said he was \u201cdone with him\u201d so that leads me to believe you\u2019ll be done with the relationship soon anyway soo\u2026 I hope you can get this kid's behavior under control before you meet another man.

If he's strong enough to pick up a gallon, dump it, and smash it, then yes it sounds like something my kid would've done at that age too while playing out in the yard.

I hate when kids are called liars or brats or whatever, bc they grow up with that in their mind. \"I'm a liar.\" \"I'm a brat.\" \"I'm terrible.\" Etc. \n\nAnd yeah, my kid would've done the same thing especially if I'd shown him how to do a cool trick with it the day before. \n\nIf your fiance is that upset over $15 worth of water that he's going to call your kid a db and then break up with you, then please... let him go.

It's a behavioral specialist speaking with the parents and providing the parents resources to deal with the child.

You\u2019re wrong for allowing him to mistreat your child. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 actively talks shit about your son to your face and you \u201chold your temper?\u201d This means you don\u2019t say anything because now your man feels comfortable insulting your kid to his face.\n\nI would wager the behavioral problems you mentioned are from the child picking up in your fianc\u00e9\u2019s dislike of him. Your son is only 5 and is already lying and destroying things. You say he\u2019s fine at school and with others, so he\u2019s only problematic with your fianc\u00e9? Then guess who the problem is! You\u2019d be negligent and cruel to marry this man. He has no love for your child and you allow it.", "YTA. Sure, not cool to call him names, but how about you actually parent and take care of your kid that clearly can\u2019t behave? \nHow are you \u201etrying to figure stuff out?\u201c is he in actual therapy? What do YOU do except letting your fianc\u00e9 deal with the aftermath? How long has this been going on that she has \u201egiven up\u201c? Why was no one watching him if it\u2019s so clear he \u201egot problems\u201c? This is your kid and your responsibility.", "Honestly, I\u2019m annoyed that this has so many upvotes. You don\u2019t just go to the doctor and voila! Your kid is perfect overnight. These things take time. The kid is only 5 years old, he\u2019s on meds, and OP is aware of the problem. There\u2019s a massive chance that they\u2019re not done working on the issues, especially since OP said \u201che\u2019s on behavior meds and we\u2019re trying to figure it out\u201d.", "OP literally says that 5yo is on meds and they're \"trying to figure it out\", implied \"what is wrong\".\n\nHow do you think these things work? That a doc waves a magic wand to conjure a diagnosis and a fully working treatment that sparked effect immediately so everything is fixed right away? Even just figuring out what is wrong can take years, even decades. Then add more years or even decades to find a working treatment for the issue(s) assuming one exists.", "I agree, but am I the only one confused about what gender everyone is here?\n\nA fianc\u00e9e is female, but OP also says their future spouse is a man?", "I wouldn't blame a psychologist for blowing up at him  \n\n\n95% of the time hes terrible? People are being too harsh on the stepdad, you try and look after something like that", "I'm going to respectfully disagree. My son had \"behavior issues \" that had nothing to do with getting reactions and everything to do with OCD and a childhood tic disorder. For example he compulsively busted glass in the same spot in the yard for an entire summer. Jars, glasses, light bulbs out of the lamps. It was triggered  when he accidentally broke the glass tabletop. It took an entire summer to break that particular script. \n\nOften times what looked like anger or defiance in both of my kids was actually sensory processing issues and compulsive behaviors. It's frustrating as fuck somedays, but all we can do is keep trying to hold our tempers, reward good behavior and correct bad... over and over and over in a tedious cycle. Because behavior issues aren't fixed in a few months or even a year.", "Because OP was doing some work inside the house and said that the yard is fenced in,  so it shouldn't have been a problem. \ud83d\ude44 \n\n\nOP is quite negligent and not fit to be a parent. The fiance should run for the hills away from OP and her child, whose default personality is acting like the devil's spawn. \n\n\nYTA", "Kinda sounds like the mother has given up on him too,imo! So you don\u2019t want him to say anything To his face behind his back is ok? Fuck that. Get to the source of the problem,with doctors, therapists,Whatever you need to help the kid and stop talking badly about him.period.", "It feels like she put him on meds and that was it. He\u2019s sweet 5% of the time? He\u2019s left unattended long enough to do this much damage? She loves her FIANC\u00c9 \u201cmore than anything\u201d implies she has deemed other things more important than her child. It\u2019s all icky and she sounds very neglectful.", "Do you understand how much a gallon is... 5 year old can struggle to carry a carton of milk.. in no way can a 3 year old carry it with ease...", "I mean, again, she said \u201cwe\u2019re figuring it out\u201d. I don\u2019t know what about that implies that she put him on meds and that was it. And yeah, a lot of kids with issues are only sweet 5% of the time. \n\nLeaving him unsupervised for that long was obviously a problem (although, she did say it was in their fenced in backyard and she was home while it happened. Leaving children alone in the backyard isn\u2019t usually a major problem, but obviously the water presented an issue), and I\u2019m not defending the shit about loving her fianc\u00e9 more than anything, but nothing about the post or the comments imply that she is done getting help for her kid or that she simply put him on meds and hoped that would be it.", "Even I don't like carrying around 5 liter containers (gallon seems to be 4.5 liters) and I'm a 5ft 6 adult so I'm assuming OP has mixed up gallon and half gallon.\n\nNot that I'm sure a 3 year old could haul a half gallon.", "Right? OP literally said \u201che\u2019s on behavior meds, we\u2019re trying to figure it out\u201d. \n\nLike what do people here think that means? And does everyone just think you can go to a doctor and have them flip a switch so all the kids issues are solved overnight? No. It takes time to figure this shit out.", "I hope you\u2019re right.", "Then you should be with him", "What are you even doing.\n\nPut your kids up for adoption if you care so little for them.\n\nYou cannot marry a man who doesn't like your child. You are a package deal. You asshole.", "Thanks for this. I agree with this too. We don\u2019t know what mom is doing to get the kid help, and that\u2019s not what she\u2019s seeking feedback on. She got mad at her fianc\u00e9e for calling the kid a DB. And is here asking if she is wrong for that. People are voting her ta, for other reasons that they are reading into it. And that\u2019s the part I was disagreeing with.", "Fair enough! But,don\u2019t sit there and allow someone to say your kid is bad and call him a dough bag or any other name to his face or behind his back. Dick move. Thats not going to help anyone!", "I don\u2019t entirely agree with your comment but it\u2019s true there are parents (or people in general) who think the perfect medication will make everything all better. When in reality it\u2019s just one part of a solution. The way I look at it is like if you are building a brick wall. The medication is the mortar that holds the bricks together. The bricks are things like enough sleep, good routines, good emotional outlets. You can build with just the bricks and it might stay up but it might also be weak and tumble over when you least expect it. You can try and make a wall of just mortar but it won\u2019t be very high and frankly not that nice looking. But together you get a study wall, or foundation for building on later."]}
