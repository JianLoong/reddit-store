I (19M) skipped out on my sister\u2019s (17F) graduation for a good reason. About a little under three years ago, I had my own highschool graduation. My parents promised me they would give me the money I needed to buy my cap and gown, but my sister decided she needed the money more to go see her favorite artist that was doing a tour that month. My parents said, \u201cYou already had your fun in highschool, it\u2019s your sisters turn.\u201d To say that I was infuriated was an understatement. I has to do overtime and extra shifts at my job to pay for my cap and gown.\n\nMy sister has always struggled with depression since she was younger and sometimes it would get really bad to the point where our parents would have to stay with her the whole day. Skipping to the day of my graduation, I got a call from my parents saying my sister had a mental breakdown and that they couldn\u2019t come. They cancelled my graduation party and I had to take the metro home. Walking across the stage and not being able to hear my family clap and cheer was disheartening and made me feel like crap. \n\nWhen I got home, my family was sitting down on the couch watching tv and eating popcorn. They all looked at me and smiled like everything was fine. My dad tried giving me a hug but I pushed him away and went to my room. My sister tried talking to me but I wanted to be left alone and would\u2019ve lashed out at her if she stayed. \n\nMoving on to the day of my sisters graduation, I remembered how my family didn\u2019t come to my graduation and cancelled my party. So I made plans with my friends and planned on staying out late to skip my sisters graduation and her party. I texted in the groupchat that I can\u2019t make it because i\u2019m hanging out with friends. They tried calling me but I didn\u2019t pick up and had the time of my life.\n\nWhen I got home, my family was waiting for me to get home. I argued with my parents and said \u201cIf she got to skip out on my graduation why can\u2019t I skip out on her\u2019s?\u201d My parents argued back saying, \u201cShe has depression and she can\u2019t control when she has mental breakdowns\u201d It turns out that they had to cancel her party because she felt bad that she was going to have a party for her graduation I didn\u2019t have one for mine.\n\nI know I was being petty but I was upset that my family didn\u2019t come to my graduation. I feel guilty now and I shouldn\u2019t have done it because she has depression.\n\nSo AITA for skipping out on my sisters graduation?\n\nTL;DR My sister has depression and had a mental break down on the day of my graduation so my family couldn\u2019t come, then when she graduated I skipped hers.", "created_utc": 1681086565, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h1a00/aita_for_skipping_my_sisters_high_school/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's really hurtful!  NTA but still very petty, but I can't say I wouldn't have done it too. I hope that after this you can finally let it go, and I hope your sister is in counseling.", "NTA. One of your parent could have stayed with your sister and the other should have come to support you.", "Honestly and with all consideration to other's issues, NTA; they aren't there for you (and I'm taking about parents) so why should you be there?  Now I might tell my sister I love her and what not but this was a big slight against you (we'll say not her fault but it is what it is).  I mean, you aren't a priority for them on your big day, they both had to ignore you right?  So you did what you learned and did your own thing.  Your sister might be a different conversion so you may owe her a conversation, but the rest is a lived reality.", "NTA. I have a similar situation in my family with a younger sibling with mental health problems. It sucks but there is probably very little you can do to change the situation. Your parents will tell you that they love you, but your sister \"needs us more.\" It's hard but you have to work on detaching from your family and not expecting much from them. It is perfectly fine not to give them more time/energy than you get back.", "NTA because that hurts that they care more about her feelings than they do yours. They should be supportive of all their children, but instead they choose to make your sister a priority instead.", "I'm going to say NTA. We might not have the full picture as it's only describing things from your side of the story, but while it was petty, I don't think you were wrong. You worked hard to fund your graduation outfit and they canceled your party and missed your graduation. Why did they both need to stay with her? Why couldn't one comfort her while the other went to your big day? Why are you an afterthought? I'm not saying they should favor you, but it certainly hasn't been equal.\n\nYour parents are clearly assholes in this scenario. Your sister less so. But she did take that money to go to a concert while you needed it for a day that was supposed to be your celebration that everyone flaked on. She may feel bad, and she should. But I think the issue is more with your parents than her.", "NTA. Even when she got her own way, she *still* had to make herself the victim.", "Nta, honestly graduation is a milestone.  Couldn't at least one parent be there for you? Why did both have to stay with your sister. Were you petty? Yes, but I get it. Always having to be put in the backseat for another sibling. You get cheated a lot. It's not your fault or your sister's.", "NTA - You\u2019re an adult and you can choose how to spend your time. It\u2019s healthy Not spending time with people who clearly don\u2019t prioritize you and a sister who regularly has mental health episodes that always coincidentally occur on days when you have a major life event. Maybe this will be a wake up call to your family, but probably not, so enjoy true family you\u2019re making with your friends!!", "You are NTA.

Now go work extra just to pay for the cap and gown we lied about buying. Like his parents clearly never planned to go to begin with. Then come the day they say neither of them can come to his major mile stone. They cancelled the party. Then they can\u2019t even be bothered to pick him up. But when he finally comes home after a frankly crushing day, mom, dad and sister are sitting in the couch, eating popcorn, watching tv and being all \u201chappy family\u201d until the after thought walks in. \n\nBut now you must forget everything that we did and come give your sister all the fun, love and support we couldn\u2019t be bothered with for you. I don\u2019t not blame OP one bit for not wanting anything to do with that day. \n\nYes the sister most likely has no fault in this.

After all the times they bailed on you.", "NTA. Your parents are treating you badly. Why would you want to hang with them?!?", "I can\u2019t say that you\u2019re NTA.

It seems like your sister is more concerned about your feelings than either of your parents, since she cancelled her party for you.", "I\u2019m conflicted. \n\nOn one hand, they have treated you incredibly unfairly and favoring your sister over you (no matter their reasoning) isn\u2019t right. \n\nOn the other, what you\u2019re doing is essentially punishing your sister, while your parents are the ones that are mismanaging the situation. \n\nIf your sister wasn\u2019t malingering, (and you\u2019ve given no reason for us to believe she was) then it\u2019s an AH move to miss her graduation just because she missed yours. You said yourself, they cancelled her party because she was so overcome with guilt about the whole thing. I think you\u2019re pitting your anger and resentment against the wrong party. \n\nI\u2019m leaving this without a judgement though, because I feel like I can\u2019t do it justice.", "Nta. But I would consider apologizing to your sister, it sounds like she already felt pretty bad about what happened during yours, and now probably feels even worse, especially if she already suffers from depression. \nWhy couldn\u2019t one of your parents make it? Did they both need to stay?", "Info: Is your sister officially diagnosed with depression?", "NTA. \n\nI read in your other comments that up until now nothing has been done for your sisters diagnosed depression: no medication, no therapy etc. Your parents felt her needs overrode your own. It isn\u2019t entirely your sisters fault but idk from your post if she ever advocated for you up until now. So I\u2019m letting her slide but barely. However this all on your parents. They\u2019ve created this chasm between your sister and yourself thus need to deal with the fallout. \n\nYou\u2019re not to blame in the slightest and anyone that tells you you\u2019re the A H are obviously the golden child or only child. Being a sibling to another with issues is not the jam.

You decided to take your anger at your parents bad parenting out on your sister. Your sister was 14 with mental health struggles, the actions that your parents took are on them, not on your sister, but you decided to target a day that was really important to her to get back at your parents.

However, You should have communicated how that day made you feel and not taken it out on your sister in a petty way.", "ESH because you\u2019re blaming the wrong person. Your sister was only 14 or 15 at the time. Your parents chose to not pay for your cap and gown. They chose for both of them to skip your graduation and to cancel your party. They could have had one go to your graduation and one go to your party while the other stayed with your sister. They are the adults and the ones who were the AHs. Your sister was a kid like you.
