I (19M) skipped out on my sister\u2019s (17F) graduation for a good reason. About a little under three years ago, I had my own highschool graduation. My parents promised me they would give me the money I needed to buy my cap and gown, but my sister decided she needed the money more to go see her favorite artist that was doing a tour that month. My parents said, \u201cYou already had your fun in highschool, it\u2019s your sisters turn.\u201d To say that I was infuriated was an understatement. I has to do overtime and extra shifts at my job to pay for my cap and gown.\n\nMy sister has always struggled with depression since she was younger and sometimes it would get really bad to the point where our parents would have to stay with her the whole day. Skipping to the day of my graduation, I got a call from my parents saying my sister had a mental breakdown and that they couldn\u2019t come. They cancelled my graduation party and I had to take the metro home. Walking across the stage and not being able to hear my family clap and cheer was disheartening and made me feel like crap. \n\nWhen I got home, my family was sitting down on the couch watching tv and eating popcorn. They all looked at me and smiled like everything was fine. My dad tried giving me a hug but I pushed him away and went to my room. My sister tried talking to me but I wanted to be left alone and would\u2019ve lashed out at her if she stayed. \n\nMoving on to the day of my sisters graduation, I remembered how my family didn\u2019t come to my graduation and cancelled my party. So I made plans with my friends and planned on staying out late to skip my sisters graduation and her party. I texted in the groupchat that I can\u2019t make it because i\u2019m hanging out with friends. They tried calling me but I didn\u2019t pick up and had the time of my life.\n\nWhen I got home, my family was waiting for me to get home. I argued with my parents and said \u201cIf she got to skip out on my graduation why can\u2019t I skip out on her\u2019s?\u201d My parents argued back saying, \u201cShe has depression and she can\u2019t control when she has mental breakdowns\u201d It turns out that they had to cancel her party because she felt bad that she was going to have a party for her graduation I didn\u2019t have one for mine.\n\nI know I was being petty but I was upset that my family didn\u2019t come to my graduation. I feel guilty now and I shouldn\u2019t have done it because she has depression.\n\nSo AITA for skipping out on my sisters graduation?\n\nTL;DR My sister has depression and had a mental break down on the day of my graduation so my family couldn\u2019t come, then when she graduated I skipped hers.", "created_utc": 1681086565, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h1a00/aita_for_skipping_my_sisters_high_school/", "score": 407, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's really hurtful!  NTA but still very petty, but I can't say I wouldn't have done it too. I hope that after this you can finally let it go, and I hope your sister is in counseling.", "NTA. One of your parent could have stayed with your sister and the other should have come to support you.", "Honestly and with all consideration to other's issues, NTA; they aren't there for you (and I'm taking about parents) so why should you be there?  Now I might tell my sister I love her and what not but this was a big slight against you (we'll say not her fault but it is what it is).  I mean, you aren't a priority for them on your big day, they both had to ignore you right?  So you did what you learned and did your own thing.  Your sister might be a different conversion so you may owe her a conversation, but the rest is a lived reality.", "NTA. I have a similar situation in my family with a younger sibling with mental health problems. It sucks but there is probably very little you can do to change the situation. Your parents will tell you that they love you, but your sister \"needs us more.\" It's hard but you have to work on detaching from your family and not expecting much from them. It is perfectly fine not to give them more time/energy than you get back.", "NTA because that hurts that they care more about her feelings than they do yours. They should be supportive of all their children, but instead they choose to make your sister a priority instead.", "I'm going to say NTA. We might not have the full picture as it's only describing things from your side of the story, but while it was petty, I don't think you were wrong. You worked hard to fund your graduation outfit and they canceled your party and missed your graduation. Why did they both need to stay with her? Why couldn't one comfort her while the other went to your big day? Why are you an afterthought? I'm not saying they should favor you, but it certainly hasn't been equal.\n\nYour parents are clearly assholes in this scenario. Your sister less so. But she did take that money to go to a concert while you needed it for a day that was supposed to be your celebration that everyone flaked on. She may feel bad, and she should. But I think the issue is more with your parents than her.", "NTA. Even when she got her own way, she *still* had to make herself the victim.", "Nta, honestly graduation is a milestone.  Couldn't at least one parent be there for you? Why did both have to stay with your sister. Were you petty? Yes, but I get it. Always having to be put in the backseat for another sibling.

I think you\u2019re pitting your anger and resentment against the wrong party. \n\nI\u2019m leaving this without a judgement though, because I feel like I can\u2019t do it justice.", "Nta.

Did they both need to stay?", "Info: Is your sister officially diagnosed with depression?", "NTA. \n\nI read in your other comments that up until now nothing has been done for your sisters diagnosed depression: no medication, no therapy etc. Your parents felt her needs overrode your own. It isn\u2019t entirely your sisters fault but idk from your post if she ever advocated for you up until now. So I\u2019m letting her slide but barely. However this all on your parents. They\u2019ve created this chasm between your sister and yourself thus need to deal with the fallout. \n\nYou\u2019re not to blame in the slightest and anyone that tells you you\u2019re the A H are obviously the golden child or only child.

Then they could then have swapped for the party which could have been relocated. They need to decide how many children they have, and if it\u2019s two then they need to step up and act like it. NTA", "NTA then. It sounds like the pettiness was warranted.", "This..I was skeptical about mentioning this on this sub reddit, because we don't really know what is going on with the sister. But I have seen and read of situations when one sibling uses mental health to manipulate the parents and then acts all innocent and plays the victim. unfortunately we don't have the whole story and so we can't judge if the thesister constantly does this or if it was a one time thing", "Oh don't be sceptical, I mentioned that thought in reply to another comment telling OP \"it's not the sisters fault\"", "She was getting better up until the moment of my graduation and I think the reason why she even had an breakdown in the first place was because she hasn\u2019t been taking her meds. They do get her meds but at times she doesn\u2019t use them.", "So she was okay until the moment of your graduation when all attention is on you?", "NTA. They are neglecting you for her. You have every right to your feelings.", "YTA\n\nYour sister didn\u2019t choose to have a mental breakdown at the age of 15 just to inconvenience you. Yes, one parent could have stayed with her while the other went to your graduation. Your parents suck for that, but I also can understand why both would want to be with her in that moment.\n\nIt happened 2 years ago and she was a child who could not control it. You harbored anger that shouldn\u2019t have even been directed at your sister, decided to be petty, and hurt her as a result.\n\nYour sister even tried to make it right by canceling her own party to make YOU feel better.", "ETA, the parents shouldnt have bought the tickets and you shouldnt have skipped. depression is very serious, and what you did probably caused her to become more depressed.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI will say though, maybe your parents have not given your sister the full story sometimes and have shielded her from being aware of how much you were hurting. The fact that she tried to talk to you after your graduation and felt bad that she\u2019d have a party when you didn\u2019t really makes me think she wasn\u2019t fully aware of your parents doing all this to you.\n\nYou parents are absolute AHs, but maybe your sister isn\u2019t and you two should have a talk. Maybe there\u2019s still time to save this relationship. \n\nSo sorry they put you through that. \ud83d\udc96", " Bullshit!! Your parents are TA!!! So is your sister\u2026 this is so messed up\u2026\nYou deserve better than this shit, start standing up for yourself and never ever let them take you for granted", "NTA. Depression is a serious issue and needs to be treated with care. However, your parents are doing more damage to your sister by constantly coddling her and not actually managing the issues that she unfortunately has developed. I wouldn't necessarily say your sister is an AH as she's just acting the way she has learned it has been ok to act. Your parents are major A-holes and terrible parents not only to you but your sister.", "NTA. You should look up Glass Children", "Definitely NTA . They should have paid for your cap and gown And at least one should have come.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m so glad I had non-psycho parents.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s wise to do your own thing and put some distance between you and your parents. It sucks when parents favour one child over another for whatever reason. Best thing to do is to not count on them and start building your own life. It hurts less when you have your own plans.", "My brother has depression. His comes out more in anger than sadness. Most times it doesn't affect him but he does need to be pushed to interact with others. You are NTA. As stated previously, 1 parent could have stayed with your sister and the other one one gone to your graduation. Your party could ha e still happened and your sister could have chosen again to be included and have a good time or call her own friends around and let you have your moment. Your parents should have your sister in therapy if they dont already. But totally would have done the same.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHe real AHs here are your parents.", "NTA - her depression shouldn't rule the lives of all 4 people in the family unit.  They only cancelld that party because she realized it was in bad taste, to celebrate something for her but not for you.  Your sister laps up the favoritism and is now beginning to realize it cost her a sister.\n\nThey always put her first and if there is time left over, they remember you.  Have they ever told your sister 'NO - we have to give your older sister tickets to a concert so you, the younger sister can't have something you want'\n\nIt has become normal for the 3 of them to be a closer unit and exclude you.  It didn't occure to them that one parent would go to your graduation and round up other family members for the occasion.\n\nDo her days of depression always coincide with something important to you?  On the day you get married, will you get a similar call that 'sorry - we had a higher priority but you have a good day'", "And to add, family isn't always blood. Find your tribe and be happy. Sounds like a little distance would help. \ud83e\udd14", "I don't think having a mental illness is getting your way, tbh", "And what gives you the idea that she \"chose\" to have a breakdown on that day?", "did anyone apologize for noone attending OP's graduation and cancelling his entire graduation party? \n\nwhy would he apologize? his parents still attended his sister's graduation, she could have still had her party....", "In one comment OP said the sister knew the concert ticket money was OP\u2019s cap and gown money but she still took it anyway. If that\u2019s not spoiled idk what is. NTA", "I never said op was the ah.", "Do they have to? Would be pretty obvious to me that the parents priorities should\u2019ve been paying for a cap and gown rather than a concert ticket\u2026", "Yeah, like I\u2019ve said before the parents have 100% mismanaged the entire situation.", "I wouldn\u2019t phrase it like that because I know that she\u2019s proud of me every time all the attention is on me for big moments and stuff. I would say it happened because she chose not to take her meds for about a week then had a breakdown on my graduation.", "Bingo bango", "NTA, but your sister canceling her own party because you don't get to have one means she probably also blame herself for what happened. Sad story for both of you , but I do think your parents could do better,have they tried making it up to you ?", "NTA\n\nYour parents made the decision that you can be totally neglected to care for your sister. Your absence at her graduation is the result of their neglect. The extra care your sisters needs and deserves for battling with depression don't excuse their neglect.", "NTA she didn\u2019t need both parents to stay with her on your graduation. They should have done what most parents do and decide who gets to go and who gets to stay. \n\nThey\u2019re lack of awareness for how they treat your sister in comparison to you is going to ruin not only your relationship with them but also your sister.", "NTA; \u201cdepression\u201d isn\u2019t just a disease that you\u2019re diagnosed with, it can range in spectrums and can also affect any one of ur parents\u2019 children, including your own mental health. Just because you\u2019re not having visible mental breakdowns doesn\u2019t mean the lack of your parents\u2019 presence in a big moment in your life isn\u2019t going to chip away at your mental stability. Depression isn\u2019t a get-out-of-jail card, it\u2019s just another condition which, while explains peoples\u2019 actions, may not always excuse them, specially when they negatively directly affect others. That doesn\u2019t mean your sister\u2019s depression isn\u2019t valid, but your parents should\u2019ve known better that just because she has depression, that doesn\u2019t mean you also don\u2019t need care and love and their presence. The care for one child shouldn\u2019t devoid the other of love. \n\nWhat you did was petty, but in the end your parents have to ask themselves, what did we teach our son for him to do this? That these moments don\u2019t matter? Clearly that\u2019s what you\u2019ve taken out of it for them to completely skip out without any apology or any attempt to make it up to you.", "NTA, I would like to say that Opie I understand how you feel that your parents weren't there for your graduation and it made you feel so terrible and alone. \n\nI really think that your parents were really jerks for giving money that is supposed to be for a graduation cap and gown for concert tickets is just not right especially if it's a graduation from high school those are one of the Milestones you never miss. \n\nI am sorry for the hurt it cost you and I hope you don't take much of your anger out in your sister, but are you still close with her?\n\nBut are you more angry at your sister or at your parents? \n\nI wouldn't blame you if you're mad at both of them because your sister wanted money for the concert tickets knowing very well that it's for your cap and gown and your parents decided to oblige", "NTA Your family are horrid.\n\nHave the always priorities sister ?\n\nWhat other occasions have they missed ?", "NTA. I would ditch your family. Go low contact.", "She didn\u2019t need both parents for her breakdown - they were looking for an excuse to skip your graduation.\n\nNow that you\u2019re even, try to build a relationship with your sister.  I think you can safely write your parents off, so she\u2019s going to be your only family.\n\nNTA", "ESH this family needs therapy, badly.  I get you're upset and you're entitled to how you feel but that doesn't give you a pass to make your METALLY UNWELL SISTER even more guilty than she already feels.

Your sister is the only one who didn't act bad here", "ESH, they were TA for not making your graduation an event when it was important to you; and you are TA for your petty revenge", "NTA - your sister can't have everything she wants. She'll probably try to pull the same trick on other major events of your life. Watch out.", "I\u2019m so sorry that was your experience. I hope that you can find peace and make your own way through life without this constant anxiety dripping over you.
