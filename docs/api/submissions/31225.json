I'll try and keep this as concise as possible.\n\nI am in a group chat with a large group of my friends in which we interact frequently. In the chat is someone named Chris (fake name for anonymity purposes) who I've always believed has not liked me very much. We've met in person a few times, and while the most recent interaction in person was fine, I find that he makes a lot of personal digs at me seemingly out of nowhere. Ie. telling me to \"shutup\", has made jokes about being ethnically mixed (I'm half European, half west asian; but pretty 'white passing' and his past jokes allude to me not being able to call myself west asian cause' I am very pale) \\*just adding context to how our dynamic is. And I'm a sensitive person so I've always just tried to excuse these as jokes and him maybe not being that serious about them.\n\nSomehow we got on the topic of our dogs in our group chat and the topic of neutering dogs - I mentioned my dog is neutered.... and this is when all hell broke loose. At first, Chris started insulting me for such a decision (even though it was my parent's choice; I was 12 when our dog had the procedure) I tried to pass it off as him egging me on or trying to troll me, so I wasn't taking it seriously. But I realised that he was being serious and stated that neutering animals is animal abuse. This grew worse with Chris indirectly calling my mother and father animal abusers because neutering is just abuse - and stated that I was an enabler at 12 YEARS OLD. He had a couple of other people supporting him in the groupchat but most people were silent because I think the mood became very awkward. I tried being reasonable and saying that my parents were not abusing our dog and that from certain studies on dog neutering I googled, it doesn't seem like there's a black and white answer if it is \"good\" or \"bad\" for the dog. But Chris doubled down and basically insulted my parents for doing such a thing, then insulted my mental health for me not condemning what my parents did. It made me cry because I have never been told neutering was animal abuse and I KNOW my parents shower my dog with love - they would never do anything to hurt him.... so implying that they were abusing our little guy seemed ridiculous. But with time, and the fact that no one really stuck up for me, I worry that I am simply ignorant on the matter. Is it fair to even say neutering is animal abuse? AITA for trying to defend my parents? I'm not in veterinary studies so I really don't know, but it just doesn't seem right to say this about my family!

I\u2019d argue that NOT neutering a dog is animal abuse, unless that dog is intended for breeding purposes. \nIntact male dogs can be a handful and are often given up for adoption due to behavioral issues.\n\nIf this \u201cfriend\u201d is referring more to the physical act of surgery on a dog as a population control method, remind him of the millions of unwanted dogs euthanized. If the friend thinks it\u2019s preferred to spay a female, that\u2019s just ignorant. Yes spaying is good too, but like human sterilization, female surgery is much more invasive and therefore much more dangerous to the dog than male sterilization surgery.", "NTA. \n\nNeutering your animals is the responsible thing to do to avoid accidental pregnancies in my opinion.\n\nThere are also health benefits. \n\nMy parents dog got sick, it was a problem with her womb essentially filling with puss. So they got her spayed. \n\nAnd I got my male dog neutered when I got him because he was aggressive and removing that testosterone can calm them down. \n\nNew laws in the UK call for all XL bully dogs to be neutered, due to them being banned now. \n\nIf neutering/spaying your animals was abuse, it wouldn't be offered by vets. Your \"friend\" sounds uneducated and like they just want to start and fight and put you down at any opportunity. \n\nBlock him, or ignore him.", "NTA. Calling neutering dogs animal abuse is next level nonsense. Chris is an abusive person who you should block and remove from your life. He's trolling you and it doesn't matter the reason behind it. His actions are terrible.", "There is an easy solution here. Block the dude.", "Wow is Chris judgmental!  I live in the US and there are a lot of dogs (particularly in the South) that run around making other dogs pregnant. There are a lot of dogs that then get shipped up north to be adopted.  These adoption agencies all will spay/neuter the animals due to keeping the population growth down.  It is not considered wrong in the US and definitely not considered animal abuse.  He's a jerk for not listening to other people's opinions and assuming he is right.  You're NTA, especially at 12 you had no idea and it wasn't your dog.\n\nStart standing up for yourself.  If he makes racist comments, reply back with \"wow, that sounds racist\", or whatever you feel you need to say.  If your friend group considers him a good friend, you may need a new friend group if no one else starts calling him out on his racist comments.", "NTA. Chris is a racist and a moron to boot! Neutering animals is not abuse. I don't know about dogs, but there are far too many feral cats in Europe and they lead short, miserable lives. Reducing their number by neutering and releasing them again is a GOOD thing, and cat owner also routinely neuter house cats. It is NOT abuse. It keeps them out of a lot of trouble if they should escape from the home. I expect something similar is true for dogs. Unless you are a breeder there is no need not to neuter.", "I work at an animal shelter as a volunteer. Every day I see the effects of people not neutering their animals. \n\nThank you for being a responsible dog owner. \n\nThank you for not allowing your dog not to produce hundreds of unwanted puppies. \n\nThank you for giving the unwanted puppies from irresponsible owners in shelters a chance to get a home because they are not competing for one with even more puppies.  \n\nChris has a bizarre attitude. NTA but Chris certainly is.", "You my friend, are NTA. Chris is a loon. Neutering a pet is a responsible thing to do.", "NTA. \n\nLaugh at that man. Laugh at his ignorance and don't give a damn inch. Dogs who are neutered are not running around making unwanted puppies. Dogs who are neutered have less issues socializing. They're less likely to roam far, so they're less likely to get lost or run over. It doesn't hurt them, and they live long, well-loved lives. Chris' ignorance and spiteful behavior towards you is the issue, not your family pet.", "NTA but Chris is. Neutering is encouraged here because so many puppies/ dogs end up in shelters and there are kill shelters in some areas of the country.", "NTA, Chris is a jerk, trying to cause trouble adn does not know what he is talking about. Do not spend any more of your time with this person, it is just wasted.", "NTA\n\nIt is to control the number of unwanted puppies and kittens.

End of.\n\nChris is your group's bully and people weren't sticking up for you because they're cowards who are afraid he'll turn on them next.

So many people don\u2019t realize how bad the stray animal problem is because they don\u2019t live in the areas where it happens. I see posts on Reddit of beautiful dogs with only days left to live before being euthanized because they\u2019re in shelters that cannot afford the space to keep dogs indefinitely.  \n\nIt\u2019s irresponsible and stupid to leave an animal intact if there\u2019s little to no chance of breeding it, especially if the person is just an average joe and not in the business of breeding and producing specific animals. This person is also anthropomorphizing animals which also harms animals in the long run. A dog is not a person, they are not harmed by a lack of functioning balls. Intact male dogs are also a risk- they are far more territorial and aggressive. This person is far closer to an animal abuser than your parents. \n\nYou should tell him off and then block him for being an asshole.
