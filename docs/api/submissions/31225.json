I'll try and keep this as concise as possible.\n\nI am in a group chat with a large group of my friends in which we interact frequently. In the chat is someone named Chris (fake name for anonymity purposes) who I've always believed has not liked me very much. We've met in person a few times, and while the most recent interaction in person was fine, I find that he makes a lot of personal digs at me seemingly out of nowhere. Ie. telling me to \"shutup\", has made jokes about being ethnically mixed (I'm half European, half west asian; but pretty 'white passing' and his past jokes allude to me not being able to call myself west asian cause' I am very pale) \\*just adding context to how our dynamic is. And I'm a sensitive person so I've always just tried to excuse these as jokes and him maybe not being that serious about them.\n\nSomehow we got on the topic of our dogs in our group chat and the topic of neutering dogs - I mentioned my dog is neutered.... and this is when all hell broke loose. At first, Chris started insulting me for such a decision (even though it was my parent's choice; I was 12 when our dog had the procedure) I tried to pass it off as him egging me on or trying to troll me, so I wasn't taking it seriously. But I realised that he was being serious and stated that neutering animals is animal abuse. This grew worse with Chris indirectly calling my mother and father animal abusers because neutering is just abuse - and stated that I was an enabler at 12 YEARS OLD. He had a couple of other people supporting him in the groupchat but most people were silent because I think the mood became very awkward. I tried being reasonable and saying that my parents were not abusing our dog and that from certain studies on dog neutering I googled, it doesn't seem like there's a black and white answer if it is \"good\" or \"bad\" for the dog. But Chris doubled down and basically insulted my parents for doing such a thing, then insulted my mental health for me not condemning what my parents did. It made me cry because I have never been told neutering was animal abuse and I KNOW my parents shower my dog with love - they would never do anything to hurt him.... so implying that they were abusing our little guy seemed ridiculous. But with time, and the fact that no one really stuck up for me, I worry that I am simply ignorant on the matter. Is it fair to even say neutering is animal abuse? AITA for trying to defend my parents? I'm not in veterinary studies so I really don't know, but it just doesn't seem right to say this about my family!

Neutering animals is not abuse. I don't know about dogs, but there are far too many feral cats in Europe and they lead short, miserable lives.
