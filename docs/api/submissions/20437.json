She\u2019s always wanted us to look like a \u201cperfect family\u201d, which heavily weighed on my mental health growing up. She neglected all of our family\u2019s problems so she could act superior. This all came to a head when I came out as a lesbian three years ago. My mother thinks people in the LGBT community are sinning, so of course this ruins her little \u201cperfect family\u201d image. I cut communication ties with her after that, and began dating my girlfriend Danny. Despite my relationship (or lack there of) with my mother, I\u2019m very close to my sister (27 f) Lizzy. She was engaged to her boyfriend of six years (29) Jack, and invited me to her wedding. Lizzy is very family oriented, and is stuck on the \u201cgood memories\u201d of my mother from before our father left (of which she has much more then me because of our age difference), so she\u2019s still in contact with our mother and also invited her to the wedding. She asked if I was comfortable with this, and if not she\u2019d understand. I thought about it for a bit, and then decided it would be better if I show off how happy and confident I am now then hide from my problems. So, last week, I attended Lizzy\u2019s wedding with Danny as my plus one. The ceremony went smoothly, and I only saw my mother from afar. It was amazing seeing my sister get married to the love of her life, and wasn\u2019t about to let that bats presence ruin the experience for me. The reception is where shit hit the fan. The first half was fun, seeing my extended family and friends and dancing. I made eye contact with my mother a few times, and each time I\u2019d sidle closer to Danny, sling my arm around her, kiss her cheek or play with her hair. Danny and I even walked right past her table once, making sure to laugh extra loud as we did so. I know it\u2019s petty, but she\u2019s a homophobic witch. Finally, my mother snapped. When Danny went to the bathroom and I was scrolling on my phone at the table, my mother approached for the first time. She didn\u2019t even pretend to be nice. She started spouting off nonsense, saying like \u201cHow dare you parade around with that woman? You look foolish. God hates you, you\u2019re going to Hell, blah blah blah.\u201d But then she went ahead and began insulting Danny, to which I said hell no. I don\u2019t know what came over me, but a bunch of cupcakes on some plate at the table next to me caught my eye, and I shoved it into my mother\u2019s face mid-spout. My sister and bro in law are on my side, (and Danny obvi) but half the family thinks I\u2019m an asshole and have been telling me I shouldn\u2019t have done something so drastic at my own sisters wedding.", "created_utc": 1687556994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hav8i/aita_for_smashing_a_cupcake_in_my_mothers_face_at/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did push it but sounds like she could have just not said anything.", "ESH. Your mum for being homophobic and you for acting like you are 12 and baiting her at a wedding.", "And the OP is lucky her Mom didn't escalate this even further by contacting the police. What the OP did could be considered assault.", "Because she's an homophonic bigot trying to ruin her life and insulting her GF maybe?", "I know, you're right, you're the voice of reason, but op's mom is just SO awful... and she got \"cup-caked\"?

It doesn\u2019t fix anything or stop anything and can escalate the issues.

Not justified.", "You don't seem to think that the mother being homophobic if a big deal. It's not provocation if there is nothing wrong with what you do. The mother is the problem.
