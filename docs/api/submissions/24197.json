Background, I was one year old when my mom found out that my dad was cheating on her. My dad has 5 kids, my oldest sister \u2018J\u2019 (26 F) with his first wife Me (16 m) and my little sister \u2018AL\u2019 (13F) with my mother. And My little brother \u2018A\u2019 (14M) and sister \u2018L\u2019 (13F) with his wife. Her son has autism, keep that in mind. My two younger sisters are only a month and 4 days apart. Anyways, I was 15, it was the day before my brothers birthday. we had just got back from watching a movie, not sure which one. Not that it matters anyway. My dads wife was making jokes about our insecurities. But she never went after her \u2018precious baby\u2019 because he was autistic and would take it hard. I was mad because my sisters felt bad about it, so i said something along the lines of \u2018maybe my dad would have to do everything if you had a job\u2019. And that set her off. Me, her, and my dad started arguing. My dad taking my side, she was angry. My sisters went in their shared room, closed and locked the door. From what i heard, AN was comferting L as she hated when her parents arugued while AN was used to it. AL stayed downstairs and just watched whatever on his phone. My dads wife said something like \u201cyou can tell him to apologize or you can take your \u2018kid\u2019 and leave\u201d. That woman wanted my dad to leave AN there. Of course my dad took me and my sister back to my moms house. She was mad when we told her what happend. Ever since, that woman said im not going in till i apologize. I dont plan on apologizing. AN although started going back, but she doesn\u2019t want to go anymore. Now that my dads wife doesnt have me or my older sister J to blame she goes after AN.", "created_utc": 1691510625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lmcc3/aita_for_not_apologizing_to_my_dads_wife_after/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was dishing it out she needs to be able to take it.", "NTA. Your dad's wife was being abusive.", "NTA.  Don't bother apologizing, it's not worth it.  This is a ruse by her to drive a wedge between you and your father.  Don't fall for it!  She was dishing out the jokes, but couldn't take it when you get it back.  Forget her - she's not worth it, and by the sounds of it, will likely end up your dad's 3rd ex.", "NTA - your father\u2019s wife is being childish at best and emotionally abusive at worst. It sucks you possibly won\u2019t see your other siblings, but imo your mental and emotionally wellbeing comes first. It\u2019s your parent\u2019s\u2019 responsibility to protect you & your siblings, not yours\u2026 but I would encourage you to try to convince AN not to go over either bc she doesn\u2019t deserve step mom\u2019s vitriol! :( I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this, OP.", "She wants no kids but her kids. She is doing this on purpose. I hope your dad see it before he looses 3 of his kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA I would not apologize either.", "NTA she sounds toxic and can dish it and not take it. Well seems like the trash just took herself out. I honestly would have hit at her homewrecking ways.", "YTA.  Their relationship and how they handle it is none of your business.  If you are going to use your words, use them effectively.  Calmly ask her, how is that funny and stare at her waiting for her to explain.  Same thing every time.  The key is to make her feel awkward and eventually she may stop because she is not getting a rise out of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
