Clearly a conversation with someone who could give a recommendation is just an excuse to fuck!\u201d", "It's not that weird to me. But it's okay if it's weird to you.\n\nI think she is probably just dumb and thought \"heat\" and then \"hot flashes\".", "Sure, I can understand that some people are uncomfortable talking about the things that happen to bodies. I think the general assumption that he's a cheater or that she's his mistress is a stretch that we, as the audience can't really assume without information that isn't given. \n\nHonestly, I've been awkward enough times in my life to understand that sometimes the root of the situation. I do know that I was never more awkward than when I was going through a major hormonal change. Between birth control changes and pregnancy, those were the times I was just saying dumb things left and right. Baby brain is no joke and I would imagine menopause can have some similarities since it's such a major bodily change.", "I think reasonable people can judge based on context what you mean and I don't particularly care about upsetting unreasonable people because they'll find something to get upset about eventually no matter what I do.", "for the record, you should NEVER tell a woman to calm down, unless you want the exact opposite reaction.", "Notary is a bit more specific than a vet", "Yep exactly", "So you would find it totally normal for a coworker you're not close to to call you during off hours?", "It can be done, but it's the worst time to do it. The vets i worked with preferred to spay an already pregnant cat over a cat in heat", "Since I moved, I had to find a new dentist, so I did the same: both googling and getting personal recommendations. \n\nI do think it's weird to call a coworker for that, I'd stick with a text. Especially since you can't spay a cat in heat, so it's not exactly urgent.", "Yeah honestly it would be normal to me, but I work in TV.", "Giving cats abortions will be illegal in the States soon! Don\u2019t say that part out loud", "\"I would be shocked if this thing didn't happen\" means the same thing as \"I believe this thing is likely\". The fact that something would shock you means the opposite is something you expect to happen.  \n\nYou also stated that OP needs to go to HR \"if he was actually innocent\", which is the same as saying \"I believe he is having an affair **unless** he reports his coworker to prove his innocence\"", "Again, THIS IS NOT A COURT OF LAW.  I came to a different conclusion than you did.  Die mad about it."]}
