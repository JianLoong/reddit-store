You're NTA. Lock your stuff up,  alarm your fridge if you have to,  make her sort her own things out.", "NTA. Can you buy your own fridge and put a lock in it. Tell her you will report her to your RA if she keeps stealing your food.", "NTA But I'd consider getting a lock for your fridge if I were you.", "NTA, unless you've got some sort of agreement with your room mate you are under no obligation to get anything at the same time. Sometimes it's an advantage to order things together as it can save on delivery costs, and some universal items can work out better cost when they are split. Cleaning items etc. Whatever agreement you did or didn't have with said room mate though it's never right for her to steal your food.", "NTA find a way to lock up your stuff.

I was wondering if she had money issues, but she did say if she knew you were ordering food, she\u2019d order some too, meaning she has her own money, she\u2019s just lazy and leeching off people.
