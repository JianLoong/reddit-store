I have not made any opinions of what will happen for these days, other than my outfits for those events. We are having a theme for the \"American wedding\" (Harry Potter, my fianc\u00e9 and I are super fans) and have asked guests to wear one of four colors: blue, green, red, or yellow. Any shade whatsoever is fine, and can be something thats not new. We put this also on the invitations as well, back in January. Everyone from my side has agreed to this, and my fianc\u00e9s family also were happy to comply with this.\n\nWhile planning the wedding I have talked for hours and months to my sister in law (not a bridesmaid) who was completely on board with all of the plans thus far. I get a call from her today saying she bought the dress and it is purple. I told her that is not in the color theme at all. She then said she couldn't find any dresses of those colors that she liked, and the ones she liked were too expensive. I told her no, all guests even flying abroad accepted my color theme and to please wear something else. She then says \"no\".

The key to the issue is your future SIL statement, \"she couldn't find any dresses of those colors that she liked\".
