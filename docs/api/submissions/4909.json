In the divorce, she wanted our house but I fought hard against it because it\u2019s been my family home for 3 generations before I inherited it. In the end we came to a compromise that was signed off by the judge. Basically she gets to live in the house rent free until our daughter turns 18 then I get it back. I had to pay the utilities, maintenance, and property taxes the entire time. In addition, she can\u2019t make any modification or upgrades to the house without my written permission, she\u2019s solely responsible for the cost, and the work has to be performed by a insured and legally licensed professional. \n\nI\u2019ve been sending her move out notices for months in anticipation of my daughter\u2019s 18 birthday and recently that came to pass. The day after I showed up to the house with a contractor because I wanted some work done before I move back in. At first she refused to let me in until I reminded her that I\u2019m the legal owner of the house, according to our divorced agreement signed by the judge, she\u2019s no longer allowed to be there, and I\u2019ll call the police if she doesn\u2019t let me in. She got the point and opened the door.\n\nI was surprised nothing was packed and it didn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s moving at all. We were arguing as I walked through and inspected my house. She wanted extra time and I told her to be out by the end of the week or I\u2019ll have her stuff thrown out. When I walked into the living room, I was shocked into silence. The living room was expanded by a wall being torn down and having the bedroom that was once there merged into it. She turned my 4BR house into a 3BR one. I know I didn\u2019t sign off on this and from the looks of it, the work was probably done by her BF and not a professional. I yelled at her and told her I\u2019m going to sue her for everything she has then I left.\n\nShe went crying to our daughter and my family now everyone is telling me to give her another month to find a place and not to sue her. My daughter is firmly on her mother\u2019s side and thinks I\u2019m the AH for kicking her mother out a couple of weeks before Christmas and suing her. This is why I\u2019m here. I think I\u2019m right and legally I am right but my daughter\u2019s opinion of me matters to me.\n\nAm I TA?\n\nEdit to answer common questions.\n\n1. My daughter is a freshman in college and I rent her an apartment near campus where she lives by herself. She has a room in my house and I assume will have a room wherever her mother lives. \n\n2. My ex fought for the house and had a chance of winning even though we had shared custody because I make much more than her. I offered her the compromise and she took it because her attorney told her it was a good deal and there\u2019s an equal chance I could win which would leave her without a house.\n\n3. My relationship with my daughter is good. She didn\u2019t tell me about the renovation because early on I told her I don\u2019t want to talk or hear anything about her mother unless it\u2019s something that\u2019s affecting her (daughter) negatively.

You're a saint, OP. You sponsored her and her partner. That lady can peace outtttttt", "NTA - She fucked around and is about to find out", "NTA. She had a super sweet deal and yet she was still able to mess it up", "Totally NTA. Actions have consequences and she needs to own up to hers. She knew she had to move out by your girl's 18th bday so she had pleeenty of time to make arrangements. And she devalued your house, hoping she did no structural damage. You are totally right to both kick her out and sue her.", "NTA.

I'm so pissed off for you!", "NTA if she didn't want to get fucked she shouldn't have fucked around with legal agreements.", "NTA. Your daughter's opinion should matter, but she is not seeing the big picture. Your ex violated what the court ordered.", "NTA, you are well within your rights. You won't be popular for doing so however. Depending on how much your daughter's opinion matters to you, you can either kick your ex out (as was the legal agreement she signed for) or let her stay one more month (and have the emotional rollercoaster stop for your daughter). In the latter case, not sure how you make your ex move if she still decides she doesn't want to, and I'm sure she will have many reasons for why that would be which your daughter will believe. In short you probably have to fight for another few months. I would definitely have a contractor look at that broken down wall, it wasn't loadbearing was it? Coz in that case you need to get her out asap and restore the mess before the roof caves in...?", "NTA since she went against the contract. You have also been sending eviction notices, so the family shouldn't feel it's being done with no notice. As far as your daughter goes, that's a hard one. Maybe try sitting down with her and talking it out to try and get back on good terms with her?", "N T A. The law was clear. You waited your time and she did something she wasn't legally allowed to. Sucks to be her. I get you value your daughters opinion of you but it doesn't pay the bills and it certainly doesn't seem to affect how your ex treats you.\n\nGood question everyone's been asking; where will your daughter be living? Still at the house with you now or with mom?", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re upset and emotional. That makes total sense. Please get legal advice first. Contact your divorce lawyer and speak to them about how she\u2019s still living there and about the work she had done. They should be able to advise you about a real estate attorney to make sure you do the eviction properly. Don\u2019t leave yourself open for her to be able to countersue or cause you any issues. Then go to another attorney to see about beginning the process to make her reimburse you for the modifications, any loss of value, and the amount required to put it back how it was. \n\nBe smart here. You\u2019re going to get your house back. You\u2019re going to need a little more patience though. Make sure everything you do is legal, above board, and documented so that you have an airtight case against your ex. You don\u2019t want to take a wrong step and allow her a way out. Take the time to think this through and follow the proper course of action. \n\nAs for your daughter, try to explain to her that she can still live in the house with you if she wants. Also show her the paperwork that says the house is yours and her mother is there illegally. She still may take her mother\u2019s side because she\u2019s worried her mother will be homeless. Showing her the paperwork and doing things the proper, legal way are the play here. Stay calm. Don\u2019t ruin your relationship with your daughter and don\u2019t give your ex an opportunity to get off the hook for what she owes.", "NTA. Buuuuuut, I would go to legal sub-reddit and make sure there are no tenancy laws that may still get in the way. As for the wall, I would charge her the money to replace it for sure. Take her to court for it. She made her bed. She had years to plan to move out and she knew when it was happening. Sorry your daughter is taking her side.", "Nta, she took for a ride, show her you got a big shiny spine, sue her for all the costs, and every fsmily member agaisnt you suing can pony up the money for you not to", "If this is real and you had an agreement/order signed by a judge, why would she need more time? It's not like she didn't know it was coming.\n\nNTA", "NTA you two had a legal agreement and she broke it. It\u2019s that simple.", "NTA. I'd be suing too, that's insane that everyone is on her side.", "NTA - she knew damn well what she was doing", "NTA, Did she ask your daughter to keep the renovation a secret?", "NTA in the slightest. She broke multiple court ordered rules.", "NTA. She knew this was coming and there\u2019s no excuse for her attempting to remodel. Sue her for all she\u2019s worth and then some.", "Well it sounds as if this was a stupid compromise. If she took away value from the house then by all means sue her. You need to tell her immediately thst rent will be charged daily.

That being said, she went running to your daughter to make you the bad guy. If you kick her out and sue her you're the bad guy and may permanently ruin your relationship with your daughter, if you don't she will turn one month into two, then three and so on. You really don't have a good result here because she's not acting like an adult who respects anything or anyone.", "NTA. I'd get things in motion to sue her tbh. And I hope you took pictures just incase she trashes the place before she leaves.", "NTA but your first step is to sit down and talk about this with your daughter. You could loose her if you don\u2019t discuss this. Next is to talk with a lawyer and let the legal process work.", "NTA ITS YIUR HOUSE", "NTA, she\u2019s known for YEARS..she\u2019s just done nothing to plan or prepare. Some peoples thinking just baffles me", "Honestly, NTA.\n\nThis is also why I think the inclusion of inherited properties as marital assets is kind of bullshit. I get the divide is based on the idea that, \"you wouldn't have gotten this if you weren't married,\" but a house you were given legit don't count there. It should have never been a question as to who it belonged to, and this should never have been an issue you had to deal with for 15 years.", "NTA. She had years advance notice, then she had months of reminders and she made modifications she was not legally allowed to do since she was basically renting the house for no cost for a set period of time. She needs to leave ASAP and she owes you whatever money it costs to fix the damages she did and restore it back to original state. Don\u2019t let anyone guilt you into stopping that was a family hoke not something you bought together", "NTA, sue her for all that she has put you through and get every penny back. Make sure everything is recorded, filed as part of numerous law suits and as your daughter is an adult, you are free. Next time even if you find someone you love, dont ever get married as divorces are way too expensive. Let your ex have a christmas she wouldn't forget and it sure will wipe that smirk off her face for all the misery she put you through. Enjoy your life and move on. If you go after your daughters opinion, you will end up where it started at your ex's feet like before. Be a man and get on with your life.", "NTA, but your daughter matters.  Let cooler heads prevail.  Talk to your daughter, show her the divorce decree, show her all of the notifications you sent.  Let her know you are unhappy with the unauthorized and most likely un permitted construction.  Then, work out a compromise with your daughter.", "His daughter is still a kid worrying about her mother. Her mother is a manipulative so and so who went back on a court order and started ripping apart his family's home. What 18 y/o wouldn't advocate for her mom, especially if asked to", "Nta", "NTA!", "NTA but I really question what kind of judge would agree to such a random, nonsense deal. Why would they give your family home to your ex wife?", "NTA, based on the details, there is no way this could be spun any other way.  Call the police, evict/sue her.  She had over a decade to plan, she went against the legal orders given in the divorce, and she\u2019s trying to sabotage your relationship with your daughter(though, in situations like this, that\u2019s already happened years ago, OP).  What kid wouldn\u2019t at least accidentally mention the remodel?  Unless the kid was told to keep it a secret/lie and was ok with it.", "You are NTA but if your daughter thinks you are, that matters more than what any of us think.", "Completely Justified Asshole.  Sounds like she's getting what is coming to her.   I would reach out to a lawyer immediately and ask for their advice, you may have landlord tenant issues.", "NTA because she\u2019s had several years notice of when she had to leave, but be careful how you handle this. Throwing her stuff out is probably an illegal eviction. To get her out against her will, you\u2019ll have to legally evict her, which generally takes longer than a month. For the sake of your relationship with your daughter, just give her a month.", "Nta she's brain washer your daughter. She's had years to prepare and save money don't know how anyone thinks she's right for what she did she ruin your home. I would kick her out and sue. She'll never leave if you don't get her out now.", "NTA, she needs to leave now", "NTA and that seems like a convoluted divorce agreement. She got to live rent free for 15 years?! I hope you didn\u2019t have to pay any alimony.", "NTA, get her out before she does more damage to the house.", "NTA.\n\nBut you do have to sit down with your daughter to explain this isn't a wanton random attack on her mother - she broke a legal agreement to not change the house and it will cost money to fix any damage this has caused and she has gotten to stay for FREE in YOUR family home for 15 years and has had months of warning that she was going to have to move out.\n\nI assume that she in fact, does know when your daughter's birthday is, and therefore when her time with the house was running out.\n\nShe is quite frankly, just trying to steal your house from you. AGAIN.\n\nI'm also assuming of course that you're not kicking out your daughter, just your ex.\n\nI would give her a small extension of time to appease your family/daughter but hold firm in suing to repair your house.", "So she gets 15 years of rent free housing with fairly reasonable conditions. She then makes unagreed to modifications and was even too cheap to get them done right?\n\nNTA sue her butt, shes had a decade and a half of livin life on easy mode, time to crank up the difficulty.", "NTA but do you really want to kick your daughter out of her home right before Christmas?? \n\nBecause that\u2019s who this going to affect the most.", "NTA. But if you daughter thinks you are see if you can work out a compromise that your daughter accepts otherwise you will lose her too.", "NTA and I don\u2019t know your ex, but if you\u2019re threatening to kick her out and sue for everything sounds like she\u2019s got nothing left to lose and might burn the house outta spite.", "It doesn\u2019t really seem like this is the right place for a discussion like this. We all know you\u2019re NTA for following your divorce agreement, but you\u2019re not asking about that, you\u2019re asking about whether or not your daughter is justified in seeing you as the AH, which is something none of us can answer. She\u2019s a legal adult now, more than capable of having what will probably be a difficult conversation, and should be capable of coming to terms with her mother\u2019s failures here. Ask her yourself if she thinks you\u2019re the AH and explain to her why you\u2019re not. our discussion here is worth much less than that.", "NTA. But as I am not familiar with these kind of things is there a way prove that there were modifications? Like the original blueprint of the layout?

I hope you win your lawsuit.", "INFO: Why were you going to lose possession of an inheritance in a divorce? They're generally protected from your spouse.", "NTA\n\nBut I would be as nice about this as you can easily afford to be, just because of your daughter. \n\nAs messing up houses go, tearing down a wall (as long as it wasn\u2019t load bearing) is relatively easy to fix - you\u2019re doing renovations anyway, get a quote on the cost with and without the wall and ask her to pay the cost of fixing it. \n\nIf there\u2019s a big wealth difference between the two do you, and you can easily afford to cover the extra cost, I\u2019d honestly just eat it. Yes, she\u2019d have gotten one over on you by violating the agreement without consequences, but in the long run I think it would pay dividends with your daughter for you to be the bigger man here, not to mention not having to engage with her through a drawn out court battle. You get to just close the door behind her when she\u2019s gone and finally enjoy your house.  Depending on your situation, that may be well worth the cost.", "NTA, for the reasons mentioned numerous times. \n\nYou may want to reconsider kicking her out before Christmas though. You have every right to do so and no one would blame you if you did, but it sounds like your daughter\u2019s not on board.

She broke the agreement sue her ass.", "Run her into the ground", "NTA but ywbta in your daughter\u2019s eyes so I would tread very carefully if you want to maintain a relationship with her. Now that it is clear to the entire family she is to be out. I would consider giving her a month\u2019s grace. I would make it very clear to all that you are doing this and you are being generous. I also would consider not suing her. Weigh the costs of being aggressive against the costs of losing your daughter.", "NTA. You should put it on YouTube when she is getting the boot", "ESH\n\nThis isn't just a dispute between you and your wife. It directly affects your daughter, who you also are kicking out of the home she grew up in, right before Christmas.\n\nYour ex wife obviously sucks for breaking the terms, but you suck for refusing to see how this situation hurts your daughter, who is innocent in all this.\n\nEdit: ok, OP has now clarified he's not evicting his daughter. But given she's calling him an AH for his heavy-handed way of dealing with this, I think it's still an ESH. It's one week till Christmas and OP can get the ball rolling then without being accused of ruining the holidays.", "NTA!!!  She's breaking your legal agreement and lowering the value of a home that you own.  A 4-bedroom home is much more valuable on the market than a 3-bedroom home.  So her unauthorized modifications have literally stolen money from you.  And you aren't kicking her out right before Christmas.  She's had months to make alternate arrangements and has failed to do so.  That's 100% on her.\n\nI can understand you being upset by your daughter's attitude.  But your daughter is wrong.  Unfortunately, your daughter is also a woman, and women often think emotionally instead of logically.  So the best you can do is proceed to kick out your ex and sue her for the diminished value of your house that she wrecked.   Nothing you can do about your daughter that will sway her mind.  She might understand better when she'd older and divorced.  Or maybe not.\n\nI forgot to add...\n\nTaxes on a house can easily cost many tens of thousands of dollars.  And a 4-bedroom home is taxed at a much higher rate than a 3-bedroom home.  So when your ex made the illegal modification to change it from 4 bedrooms to 3 bedrooms...\n\nNot only did it decrease the value of the home, but it fucked the owner on tax liability, also.  For many years, you have been paying property tax at a rate based on the improvement being A FOUR BEDROOM HOUSE.  Even though it's just a 3 bedroom house, which would be a lot cheaper, in terms of property tax.\n\nSue, sue and sue some more.  Get the ex to pay for professional construction to put the 4th bedroom back in.  Also sue for the increased tax bill that you should not have had to pay, as the house was not 4-bedroooms!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She might be upset because she would have to leave the house with her mom. I don't think she wants to live with her dad.\n\n>she's thinking emotionally, rather than logically. Like many women would do.\n\nRight. Because men who can't keep it together and punch walls when they get mad are SOOOOO logical.\nCut your misogynistic crap. It's almost 2023, no one wants to put up with that shit anymore.", "This doesn't make any sense. Being a man or being a woman doesn't matter here. And no, you worder your comment exactly like you thought of it, with a misogynistic mindset.\n\nBefore you try to counter my argument with a \"You're probably a woman, that's why you disagree with me.\", I'm a man.", "Lol yes he can", "His daughter has always lived with her mother, so my assumption was she would continue to do that. \n\nMaybe OP can provide us more INFO as to the proposed living arrangements?", "OP is nonetheless going to taint his daughter's 18th birthday and her Christmas with bad memories instead of waiting a month to evict. That's kind of an AH move in itself. As I said, the daughter is the one I feel sorry for here.", "100% agree, but he could easily get the exact same results be will likely get anyway by appearing to be the nice guy.  A legal eviction takes time. If he contacted a lawyer and got that process started he can make it seem like he's being a super nice guy by giving his childs mother an extra month,  when in reality it's probably going to take a month or longer anyway. \n\n I said completely justified asshole, because I dont consider that a bad thing.   I think it's kind of an asshole move to kick someone out of their home of nearly two decades even I'd that person is a way bigger asshole for having to be kicked out. I also think he is completely right to do it, and he definitely doesnt suck.  So the ESH judgment work here.", "Because it's her dad's house. You get a clue", "If she leaves voluntarily, she hasn't been evicted, by definition.", "Nah, We don't need info. It's his family home. He has been paying child support and rent for someone else. The ex tore apart his house and now has the nerve to ask for extra time. Who is paying for that? His daughter never told him about it either. Once he saw that, he was NTA", "Yes, he updated that just a few minutes ago, well after my posts.\n\nI maintain my view ESH because this can easily wait one more week and OP's daughter has told him he's being an AH", "This isn\u2019t a Hallmark movie.\n\nLet\u2019s say they even celebrate Christmas (very presumptuous) it\u2019s not a holiday that sneaks up on you. Ex should have made a plan way before now.", "PRE. NUP.\n\nI am a medically disabled housewife. My spouse works, owns a home, etc. If they had asked me to sign a prenup, I would have done it with no problem so long as it was fair. \n\nMarriage is a lot of things, but one of those things is a legally binding contract that requires government approval to terminate, with the terms of that termination decided by the aforementioned government. \n\nNegotiate that shit ahead of time, make sure both parties' interests are protected, and then this shit doesn't happen nearly as easily.", "I see.", "I see your point but this more on the ex. She shouldn't have tried to use the law to steal what wasn't hers. Also we have no clue how much shit talking his daughter had to hear from her.", "That gives her more time to mess with the house and I doubt she will even pay rent.", "Honestly, I don't think he would need an eviction notice to get her out since it's in court documents that she had until the daughters 18th birthday.", "dont think shes a fan of that guy", "Given that OP raised Christmas in his post why would it be presumptuous to think they celebrate Christmas? He literally asked if it's an AH move to evict the week before Christmas and yeah, I think it is. He wouldn't even be able to move in befire Christmas if he started the proceedings now. This can wait until after the holidays.", "That could be true. But she let her mom tear up a family home. A home that he has to repair. I'm sure that OP would let his daughter stay. I wouldn't let that woman stay in my home a second longer", "He is paying for her apartment"]}
