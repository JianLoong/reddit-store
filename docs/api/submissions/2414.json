For some reason, that makes everyone around me think i am always available. I'm not. I'm a very busy person who has problems saying no. I'm a mom with a 10 year old who does sports and scouts, a scout leader, an officer in our larp group, a baby sitter, a PTA member and everything that comes with being a housewife. To top it off, the past 3 months, I've been helping a close friend recover from an almost fatal car accident(I used to be a nurse, so I provide home help care to said friend) plus I'm 32 weeks pregnant with my second child. \n\nA month ago, my doctor told me I had to cut back on most of what I'm doing due to my blood pressure or I'd be put on bed rest for the rest of my pregnancy. I've cut down my babysitting to one child, once a week, cut back on scouts, took a temporary leave from Larp and PTA, and rearranged things with my husband and kid so husband could do sports and husband and kid took on most of the housework to give me a break. My friend won't let me do much for them at the moment either because they are concerned. I thought things were going great and I felt so much more relaxed. \n\nThis is where the problems came in. Basically as soon as my family realized I have more free time, they started in with \"requests\". Helping with doctors appointments, running to the store, asking for help with the kids and homes, trying to push holidays off on me.. most things didn't seem like a problem at first, but it started to quickly add up. My last doctors appointment two weeks ago, my blood pressure had come back up and I was put on bed rest. I started telling my family I couldn't help, that I was putting myself and my baby at risk. \n\nThis spiraled into a huge fight with my family. I have the time and what each person was asking wasn't alot but no one listens that it's not just one person asking for things, it was everyone asking for small things every day. No one will listen. I finally just stopped answering my phone. I can't do it anymore, it's too much. It ended with my mom showing up at my house to yell at me that family helps family and that I'm lazy for not wanting to help.\n\nI feel absolutely aweful.
