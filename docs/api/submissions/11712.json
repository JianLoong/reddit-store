Two years ago he suffered a heart attack that the doctors believe was at least partially caused by his obesity. They told him he needs to seriously re-evaluate his lifestyle and dietary choices.

I have brought this up with him multiple times, but he keeps telling him that I have \"nothing to worry about\".\n\nLast weekend my girlfriend and I went to visit my parents for dinner. My mother wasn't in the mood for cooking, so we ordered pizza instead. As we were eating, my dad brought up the topic of kids again. I got frustrated and that's when I told him \"Dad, as I told you multiple times we don't plan on having kids in the next few years, so if you really want to live to see your grandkids, you need to start eating healthier and lose some weight\".

Your life, your choices. \n\nOn the other hand, his weight is NONE of your business. His life, his choices. \n\nDo better. Bullying someone isn't helping them.", "YTA.\n\nStudies show that fat shaming people doesn't work. Even if they do manage to lose weight it rarely stays off for long because that kind of motivation doesn't work.\n\nIn addition it seems like your comment had less to do with real concern about his weight and more to do with being annoyed that he brought up children again.", "INFO Did you say it because you care or to get him to stop talking about kids? Because the weight comment didn't come up about him eating pizza only when he mentioned kids. It's kind of unfair to mention it when you all agreed to pizza.", "ESH. Your family shouldn\u2019t pressure you to have kids and while I understand that you\u2019re worried about your father the scientific consensus is that \u201cfat shaming\u201d only results in people gaining more weight and having increased health issues. It contributes to cortisol spikes leading to increased risk of binge eating. Don\u2019t let your frustration lead to behavior that will only make your father\u2019s condition worse.", "ESH- you'll announce your intentions of parenting children when you and GF feel good and ready, you've asked him to drop it and he hasn't. But coming after his weight was simply uncalled for. \n\nCats out of the bag now though, doubt he'll be asking about babies again any time soon.", "NTA. But your approach is not effective either. You need to figure out a better way to help your dad lose weight other than just scaring him into losing weight. If your mom is the one who cooks for him, then why don't you talk to her and tell her to stop cooking him unhealthy food? You could also pay for a meal delivery service that is only going to deliver him healthy meals. It might be expensive but it might also be the thing that is going to finally help him lose weight. You really need to become more creative. Book your dad for a consultation with a nutritionist. Show him some scientific studies that talk about how unhealthy his diet is. Teach him where he can buy more healthy food options and what they are. Teach him that not all healthy food has to taste like crap. There's so much you can do to help someone change their diet. Stop trying the same old approach of just explaining that he needs to change, he already knows that. Teach him how to change. Help him change.", "YTA\nYou didn't say it from a place of genuine concern and love for him.

Some people would rather live the way they want than to live *longer*, without the things they love.  \n\n(The joke is \"If you give up booze, cigarettes, and fried food, will you live forever?\" *No, but it will seem like forever*.) \n\nMost parents your dad's age will ask about grandkids occasionally, or constantly. My kids just say \"not yet\" and leave it at that. No need to be cruel about it.", "YTA\n\nThat comment was unnecessary and meant to be hurtful. You didn't get your message across at all.", "ESH -- you both need to mind your own bodies/reproductive business and respect one another's boundaries. Stop explaining things and just \"gray rock\" him/them next time the topic comes up.", "ESH. it's shitty of your family to keep bugging you about having kids however that is only recently losing traction as socially acceptable and its been socially unacceptable to tell people essentially \"you're fat and going to die within 5 years\"  for a very long time. I'd recommend working on finding ways to set and maintain boundaries before you reach the point of losing your temper and making personal attacks.", "YTA. Your father was definitely in the wrong for continuing to pester you about kids when you have repeatedly told him that you won't be having them (also, side note: gifting HIM grandchildren is such a selfish way to look at it).\n\nThat said, you are still responsible for your own actions regardless of wether or not you were provoked. You still snapped at him and that's on you.", "Soft YTA. The way you snapped turned it into something you said in retaliation, rather than as a gentle, concerned chat.\n\nI get where you're coming from with the constant questions and you would have been right to put him in his place about it. But weight is such a sensitive issue and you flung that at him pretty harshly.", "YTA, I see where you're coming from, but that is such a non sequitur that I don't think it could be taken in any way other than rude.\n\nYou might have gotten a better result from \"we worry about your health, please take care of yourself so you live long enough to see the grandkids we're not planning to have for a few years.\" But instead, you said something that roughly translates to \"you are too fat to play with my hypothetical children.\" Ouch.", "ESH.\n\nThey should stop asking about grandkids.

Losing weight, particularly when you have a lot to lose, is not easy.  There is a lot of research demonstrating that the medical community does not really know how to achieve effective long-term weight loss, particularly not without creating other physical and mental health issues. Your father knows he needs to lose weight, he doesn\u2019t need you to slam him with it to shut down an unrelated conversation.", "ESH \n\nYour parents are AHs for pushing you into having kids. That is a decision you and your wife need to make at a time that's right for you. \n\nYou are very slightly TA. Your dad is unhealthily overweight, so I'm sure he's not ignorant to that. But, did you really need to shame him? There are more productive ways around encouraging someone to lose weight.", "Nta, this isn\u2019t a case of body shaming. His excessive weight is actively harming his health in a way that is deadly. He needs a wake up call.", "Yes, very much YTA. I understand that you\u2019re worried about your dad\u2019s health. But what you said to him was basically \u201cYou\u2019re so fat and unhealthy you\u2019re going to die before you ever see your grandchildren.\u201d Like, come on. It is true? Yeah, probably. Was it a kind or helpful thing to say? No, it wasn\u2019t. You\u2019ve been horribly cruel to another human being (who happens to be your own father). I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re hassling you about grandkids (my parents do the same) and I know it\u2019s frustrating to watch someone enable their partners\u2019 bad behavior, but you were unjustifiably cruel to your dad. Grandkids are obviously something that means a lot to him and you used that to be manipulative. Please apologize and tell him you just care about his health and it came out wrong.", "NTA. It's not like you said \"yeah well and you're fat, so??\"\n\nI can understand why you lost it on him because that grandkids shit gets old fast. And hearing what you said might not only give him a wakeup call, but also your mom, who continues to encourage the unhealthy lifestyle.", "NTA\n\nBut very misleading headline, and possibly statement to him. You were not going to keep him from seeing your kids because he is overweight...that honor belongs to the health gods.\n\nA better way to put it is \"I feel bad that your weight is going to kill you before you have the chance to spend time with your grandchildren, and that would be so sad\"", "NTA.\n\nYour message was basically that if he hopes to be around long enough to possibly meet his grand children he's going to need to take care of his health which is reasonable. Especially in the face of his first heart attack. You didn't tell him that he'll only meet them if he loses weight.", "YTA, asking about kids is annoying and rude but doesn\u2019t make him an AH. You making comments about his weight that he is well aware of, makes you an AH. You were trying to hurt him. You\u2019re not helping him by shaming him.", "YTA \n\nYour words were insulting, and it seems like you meant them to be. \n\nYou can hope that this gives him some motivation to lose weight, and maybe some good will come of it.", "Nta when someone pushes and pushed and pushes and refuses to accept the polite 'no' then they better be prepared for a rude 'no'.", "Nta - they\u2019re being invasive yes; but if your father has made no attempts to change his lifestyle even after the heart attack then \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. They were being invasive, so you returned the favor.", "NTA Your father gives you his unwanted opinion over and over, now he knows what it feels like. While his weight is none of your business neither is you getting married or having children *his* business.", "NTA, your title had me thinking you were YTA at first but after reading the entire post, your Dad is only hurt because he knows deep down that you are right and you weren't mean/disrespectful.", "[removed]", "NTA.\n\nI feel like a lot of people are reading this as you withholding your children from your parent due to his weight.\n\nThis is not the case here.\n\nYou don't have any children right now.\n\nAnd it's a fact that if he doesn't get his shit together, it's likely that he will die before you do have children.\n\nHopefully this is the wakeup call your father needs.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
