You could also pay for a meal delivery service that is only going to deliver him healthy meals. It might be expensive but it might also be the thing that is going to finally help him lose weight. You really need to become more creative. Book your dad for a consultation with a nutritionist. Show him some scientific studies that talk about how unhealthy his diet is. Teach him where he can buy more healthy food options and what they are. Teach him that not all healthy food has to taste like crap. There's so much you can do to help someone change their diet.

I highly recommend the podcast Maintenance Phase.", "esh. he's a dick for constantly asking and you're an asshole for how you approached it. like others said it was a retaliation, not a genuine concern. \n\nalso you're kind of dumb with the whole \"we don't believe in the institution of marriage\" shit. legal marriage is a matter of benefits and rights in relation to your partner. if you are not married to your partner and something tragic happens to them, you will not be the one to decide what happens with the doctors unless you establish a power of attorney agreement prior to that. you can get married without combining legal assets as long as you look at your local laws and get a pre (or post) nup agreement accordingly. (in the us) marriage comes with tax breaks, shared benefits for retirement, next of kin rights, ability to share health benefits...", "yeah, but OPs dad is a A H too because they keep pressing them for kids, when its clear they don't want any. and its not like OPs wrong either. 63 and having a heart attack while obese is a sure path to a early grave, and if someday OP does decide to have kids, his current path means they may only get to see a gravestone and family photos. IMO NTA", "It becomes everyone else\u2019s business when nurses, doctors, and EMTs/paramedics/firefighters are injuring themselves trying to lift and transfer these patients who weigh 300+ lbs. \n\nThis whole \u201clive whatever life you want no matter how much strain it puts on the healthcare system\u201d mentality is extremely selfish. \n\nThe pandemic should\u2019ve showed everyone just how understaffed and stretched-thin our healthcare system is. Please don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that our healthcare system is recovering - it is still hanging by a thread. \n\nWe can\u2019t afford more people making themselves sick.

Is it \"everybody's business\" if you remodel your kitchen and some worker gets a hernia or a bad back?  No. There are proper lifting techniques and various lifting devices for each of these professions.\n\nYes, OP's father is extremely selfish.  But OP isn't going to shame him into changing his ways.", "I did not ask constantly.  I asked once a year or so.\n\nWhen the answer was \"not yet\" a year ago, I think it's OK to ask again.", "I don't really see the need to ask at all. If a grandchild appears you are unlikely to miss that happening! So just wait and see? Asking isn't going to make it happen any quicker and might be perceived as intrusive if they didn't bring up the topic themselves.", "Why do you ask again?

That's why they said it's an ESH with OP being close to YTA.  \n\n\nDoing anything to someone who has consistently told you to stop is a dick move, and is bad behavior.  That's not an over exaggeration.", "Pressuring someone to procreate is bad, full stop. Or would you say a husband pestering his wife to have a baby is okay too?", "He flat out says the guys dad is bad and \"Maybe if dad cared more about his own healthy than pressuring his son, he would've been in a better health than he is now and wouldn't need to hear his son lecturing him\". That sounds an awful lot like saying the guy had a right to lecture his dad. But maybe I'm reading into things that are not there.  \n\n\nNobody is arguing that his dad is out of line with the constant badgering about grandkids. Or that his behavior is bad. Only that bad behavior doesn't mean he is a bad person. That's a massive over generalization.", "Pressuring someone to procreate is bad, agreed. Pressuring someone to procreate does not in and of itself make someone a bad person. These are two easily distinguishable concepts.  \n\n\nAlso a father bringing up the topic of kids with his son and DIL is not the same thing as a husband pressuring his wife to have a baby. That is a red herring and I'm sure you're aware of that.", "yeah, sure, the guy is the AH. I've said that. I've also said that dad is the AH for the pressure. I read some of the comments, and I agree now that OPs reply could've been more kind and sounded less like a lecture, especially so hard. Now, I would say that OP is a hard AH.\n\nNow, that doesn't exclude the fact that dad should be taking care of his own life, not harassing his son. And I do think dad is bad for a simple fact: he is not hearing his son. If son says no, stop talking about this, and dad doesn't respect that. For me, it is someone who doesn't respect his kid.  Now, I've also realized how controversial I am because OP is also not respecting his father wish of not wanting to talk about his weight (regardless if the concern is correct or not). \n\nThat's why it's ESH.", "It\u2019s really not. Pressure to procreate when someone isn\u2019t ready is deeply wrong and manipulative no matter who does it.

I also hadn't considered the fact that his son was continuing to talk about his father's weight when his dad didn't want to talk about it.  \n\n\nI guess the AH apple doesn't fall far from the AH tree.", "Perfect. Conversation ended.", "to be honest, both of them could use an actual conversation. Op could just say his worries in a way he doesn't sound like he despises his father. And Dad could just talk of how he wishes to be a grandad but doesn't know how to bring up this without sound like he is demanding his grandkids. I know is kinda clich\u00e9, but maybe at least one session of therapy could already help the communication"]}
