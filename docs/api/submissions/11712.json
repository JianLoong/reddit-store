You could also pay for a meal delivery service that is only going to deliver him healthy meals. It might be expensive but it might also be the thing that is going to finally help him lose weight. You really need to become more creative. Book your dad for a consultation with a nutritionist. Show him some scientific studies that talk about how unhealthy his diet is. Teach him where he can buy more healthy food options and what they are. Teach him that not all healthy food has to taste like crap. There's so much you can do to help someone change their diet.

Let me explain.\n\nI started gaining weight in my early 20s. I switched from hard labor to knowledge work, and I had money to buy the food I wanted. Food was a reward system for me, it was a comfort. I never had a healthy relationship with food as fuel. So if I was eating, I was eating something worth enjoying. No way I\u2019d choose a salad over a double burger because salads suck in comparison. They still do.\n\nBut the thing is, not a day went by that I didn\u2019t look at myself in the mirror in disgust.

Whenever anyone tried to talk to me about it I would respond with all of the venom of my self hate and disappointment in myself. I didn\u2019t need to be told I was fat. I felt it with every step I took. I was the one that was completely out of breath after a flight of stairs. I\u2019d read and tried every diet book, and health article. I knew what I needed to do, I knew how to do it. I had the knowledge. But it was my brain that needed the work first. It didn\u2019t matter what I ate, if I was just going to try to rationalize \u201cjust this one treat, back on track tomorrow, besides, you did good today, reward yourself.\u201d\n\nBut when my kids expressed their concern, that was the most painful. I knew in my own head that I had let them down. But hearing that they (in my own head) don\u2019t look up to me and see me as a fat peice of shit, it hurt, and I reacted with venom.\n\nYour Dad\u2019s health is his own journey to walk.

You simply stated that he needs to eat healthier and lose weight (I would guess the doctor used phrasing either similar or verbatim), which is hardly mean or insulting.

People are inherently lazy and will not make a meal if one is provided for them. Your mother is the one who needs to start making healthier dishes.  Maybe that is why your dad is saying there is nothing to worry about, because the blame is only partly on him. Your mom enables him.  \n\nDoes you mom walk around a lot or are they screen people? Screen people like to be on their butts and will not motivate each other to move. They just want their screen. Get rid of the TV, if you can. TV also makes people snack, far too much, even if they are not hungry. If she is a screen person, it will enable him to be the same.\n\nPeople will try to fix your life while not wanting to fix their own issues. But it took my kids to say something for me to actually start making the necessary changes in my life. I hope your dad heard your words and makes changes. I needed the hard truth from the people I loved the most.\n\nIf you were to blame for anything, it would be for ordering a pizza instead of choosing a healthier alternative. I'd hate to think of what the beverage of choice was. \n\nIf anything happens to your dad, who would be responsible for lifting him into a tub, helping him onto a toilet, supporting him to get him to bed.

Maybe, lead by example and be supportive of your parents as making the needed changes will literally turn their whole lives upside down.

Also, I don't believe you've told him politely numerous times that he needs to loose weight to see any future grandkids. If you actually had then why would he explode the way he did? He's 63. At this rate cancer will kill him faster than obesity. Also, after any major health crisis a doctor will always advise a patient to loose weight if it's deemed necessary. I'm not advocating for people to be overweight or not healthy. But he's 63.

Worrying about someone\u2019s weight when it so significantly effects their health is valid. Nobody would be saying this if the father had an eating disorder that caused him to be frail.

I guaren-dame-tee your father knows full well that he needs to lose weight.  He has a mirror.  He isn't choosing to be fat -- he has an addiction.
