I'm in a tough spot right now and feeling pretty guilty about recent events. I need your judgment to help me figure out if I'm the one in the wrong. Here's what happened:About two months ago, I had to go out of town for an important work trip, leaving behind my beloved cat, Whiskers. \n\nSince I couldn't take him with me, I asked my sister, who lives nearby, if she could take care of him temporarily. She agreed, and I felt relieved knowing that Whiskers would be in good hands.Fast forward to last week when I returned from my trip. I contacted my sister to make arrangements for Whiskers to come back home. \n\nShockingly, she refused to return him, claiming that my apartment is too small for him and that he's better off with her. I was taken aback and didn't know how to respond initially.To give some context, my apartment isn't huge, but it's certainly not unsuitable for a cat.   \nWhiskers has been living with me for two years, and he's always been happy and healthy. I provide him with everything he needs and ensure his well-being. There have never been any concerns about his living conditions until now.After failed attempts to reason with my sister, I felt desperate and made a decision that I now regret. \n\nI called the police to intervene and help me retrieve Whiskers. It was a drastic step, and I realize that now. The police did visit my sister's place, but unfortunately, they couldn't do much since it's a civil matter. They advised us to resolve it privately or seek legal assistance if necessary\n\n.As if the situation wasn't stressful enough, my parents got wind of what happened, and they're absolutely livid with me. They believe I overreacted and didn't give my sister a chance to work things out amicably. \n\nThey argue that calling the police was excessive and that it has strained our family dynamic.Now I'm left feeling guilty and questioning if I went too far. Should I have tried harder to resolve this issue peacefully? Am I the asshole for involving the police and causing such turmoil in our family? I genuinely want what's best for Whiskers, but I fear I may have damaged my relationship with my sister and parents in the process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for calling the police on my sister and now facing the wrath of my parents?

That's a family member", "NTA, it\u2019s your cat, and she agreed to care for it temporarily.  It is insane that an adult would essentially steal someone else\u2019s pet.  I am so sorry, and what the hell is wrong with your parents.", "Your sister and you parents are complete AH\u2019s. You did not create any turmoil at all. Your thieving sister did. If anyone has damaged any relationships that is first on your sister then on your parents for taking her side. Shame on the lot of them. Obviously they\u2019ve always played favourites and you\u2019re left to fend for yourself? Fuck no. Go get YOUR cat and give your AH family a piece of your mind. \n\nAlso put in a complaint about the shitty police work because that cat is YOUR property and your sister STOLE said property. What a crock of shit. I\u2019m so sorry you are surrounded by idiots, OP. \n\nNTA.", "Now now, you know the expectation here, OP. You talk about your cat, you gotta pay cat tax. We wanna see Whiskers, and we wanna know if he\u2019s back at home.", "NTA. She basically stole your cat by refusing to return him to you. If she wants her own cat, she can get one but she can NOT just take your cat! Set her (and your parents) a deadline for returning the cat before you take legal actions. If you have any proof that Whiskers is your \"property\" (adoption papers, micro chip info etc), keep them save in case they don't listen to you. I hope you get Whiskers back \u2764\ufe0f\n\nPersonally if someone did that to me, I would go low/no contact with them even if they did return the cat to me. I wouldn't be able to trust a person like that ever again", "NTA but before calling the police could you have tried taking your cat back?\n\nAssuming your sister let your cat outside that is", "NTA.\n\nIts your cat and your sis is a catnapper", "Did she give Whiskers back or not?

Your sister stole your cat. She brought this one herself.", "Did you get your cat back or not? If not why are you on Reddit in stead of banging on your sisters door demanding your cat back?\n\nId be there with a bat and an air horn bang g on the door until she returned my pet.\n\nYTA to your cat. You\u2019ve done nothing to save your baby. Shameful:", "NTA, I think stealing a cat is much worse on the family dynamic", "Have your parents told your sister to return your cat? If not, then they have no skin in this game. She has stolen your cat. This is not a pair of socks, this is a living being.\nNTA", "Your parents and my parents should get together and go bowling.", "NTA. She's lucky all you did was call the cops, & I don't know why cops went out on that call knowing there was nothing they could do. Contact a local shelter & ask for advice, an animal rights attorney, etc.\n\nSince your sister is psycho, as are your parents, I'd consider acting out of character. Get cat back in a way no one could anticipate. Sis is leaving for work. Door is open. As she goes to lock it, you & Guido bust in as you say to her doesn't she remember she invited you both over for breakfast today? By God, you're gonna get that breakfast now. How's she going to prove she didn't ask you in? How's she going to prove you ran out with her cat she supposedly owns? After getting Whiskers back, srsly consider NC with the rents & her, & doing some therapy. Distance can change this dysfunctional dynamic with these ppl & you can come back a stronger person. I honestly would have an utter meltdown if anyone ever tried to steal my cat. Just, wow. Good luck", "Even if it was family I would go ballistic if someone tried to keep my cats from me. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI have a dog, and I care for her more than I can care for a lot of people. If i trust in someone to take care of her and if they do the same thing you can bet that i would be fking livid about it.No one should mess with a pet, since for those who have one are family. If your sister want's a cat tell her to adopt or buy one. But stop being a dick with your cat.  \n\n\nEdit: You'll be a massive asshole if you don't tell us what happened with your cat.", "NTA. If ANYONE tried to withhold any of my pets from me I would be even more drastic than calling the police and would most likely end up trying to break their door down to forcibly take them back before something logical like getting legal assistance would even cross my mind. \n\nDramatics aside; he is technically your property according to law and especially if you have any paperwork ranging from adoption papers to a simple vet bill/records with your name on the account. If your sister stole your car or anything else you consider valuable you would do the same thing, so what is the difference?", "I need an update! This cant be real. Id be busting down the door.

Do you at least have your cat?", "Nta, in California pets are legal property, your sister is a literal thief and imo she\u2019s getting off too easily. Did she even give your cat back to you??! Wtf is wrong with her", "If I had a mog or a dog and someone stole it, I\u2019m going into Denzil \u2018Man On Fire\u2019 mode.\n\nNTA, your sister AND parents are.", "NTA - she.. stole.. your... cat..\n\ngo after her in court she burned bridges not you.", "NTA, at all. Frankly, calling the police was the NICE choice. If one of my siblings was withholding my pet from me, there would be absolute hell to pay. And probably a hospital bill.", "Info: did you tell your sister you'll call the police if she doesn't give him back? That might have done the trick before you actually had to call them.\n\nBut nonetheless, NTA. This is your pet and you have an emotional bond with him. He might be legally your property, but I hope he's much more than that to you. Your sister can get her own cat.", "Nta she stole your fucking cat", "NTA. I don't know what they expected you to do! She won't give your cat back -  talking about it more just means longer that you don't have your cat. Have you asked your parents why they are supporting her and not you in this? I think their correct response would be to ensure she returns your cat, not being angry with you! Sorry the police couldn't help. Can you try shaming her on social media or something? Post public \"my sister stole my cat\" messages for all your mutual family and friends to see, with photos of you and your cat if you have them. \"Working it out\" seems to be an unreasonable expectation when she just has your cat and won't give it back. What is there to \"work out\"?", "NTA AT ALL. But since it\u2019s a civil matter, you\u2019re now completely free to apologise sincerely, rebuild the relationship, in order to steal your cat back.", "NTA.  How in the world is this being considered your fault?  Your sister is the one who has blown up her family by *stealing* one of the most meaningful and important things in your life.\u201d\n\nThis is one to go scorched earth on and I\u2019d have one and only one message for your sister and your parents .\n\n*I* did not do this.  Sister is the one who started this by betraying my trust and stealing one of the most important things in my life.  I plan to pursue any and all legal options available to me.  I\u2019m so disappointed in all of you for daring to blame me one iota.  Until I have my cat back, I don\u2019t care to have anything to do with any of you.\u201d\n\nAnd stick to it.  This is a big one, OP.  Don\u2019t give an inch.  You are owed such a huge apology by both your parents and your sister.", ">my parents got wind of what happened, and they're absolutely livid with me. They believe I overreacted and didn't give my sister a chance to work things out amicably.\n\nNTA - I'd tell your parents that you would like their help to work things out amicably, before you file criminal charges for theft (you don't have to follow through, but mention the option).  See if you parents were just talking out their A or are willing to help.", "Honestly, she\u2019d need to call the cops and report that I maced her ass, went into her home, and took my cat back.", "I think it was stupid to call the cops. They'll never get your cat for you and you made it worse.\n\nWhat you should've done, is go to sister's house to visit the cat. Wait til she's in the bathroom. Pop the cat in a little carrier you hid outside. Take him home. Change the locks.\n\nThe end.\n\nIs it too late to do that? That's exactly what I'd have done.\n\nPS sorry I was harsh with you. You're NTA.

Clearly sis is the golden child and the parents are doing jack shit to help Whiskers come home. OP is being gaslight into thinking they\u2019re the ones who made a mistake when the sister stole the cat!   \n\n\nOP, sue your sister and go NC with your family. There is nothing about this dynamic worth  preserving.", "Police prevent less than 4% of violent crime, they're not exactly busy.", "OP gave the cat to the sister to care for. Police can\u2019t really do anything because of this. Had the sister actually stolen the cat things would be different.", "Right, this is the only thing I need to know right now!\n\nOP, get your cat back.", "THIS!! I'm sorry but also not sorry that I'd resort to something like this, like who the hell does she think she is?? Get your own cat!!", "Nah this is still theft, it\u2019s conversion 100% as someone mentioned above. Like just because OP gave permission it was limited to the time OP was gone. That\u2019s like if you loaned someone your car to go to the grocery store and they decided to not give it back and go to another state with it or use it as their own car instead.", "I am a lawyer and it actually is kinda true. It\u2019s more convoluted than that description, but it\u2019s definitely fucked up how weird the laws are regarding someone refusing to return property that was handed over willingly for whatever reason.\n\nIt was the moment in 1L Torts class when I realized being a lawyer was gonna be tough.", "This is the least helpful thing I\u2019ve ever read on Reddit.", "That\u2019s as long as the practice the pet is taken to a) receives alerts from animal control or any other database, and b) actually scans the cat for a chip and looks up the information on it. In the 15 years I\u2019ve worked in veterinary medicine I haven\u2019t ever heard of any hospital I worked for getting any sort of alerts like this and if there\u2019s no reason to look up the information associated with the microchip number there\u2019s honestly not enough time to call the company it\u2019s through and verify every single patient\u2019s owner information matches the person bringing it in. \n\nThat being said, if OP were to call all animal hospital in the area and alert them herself and gave their name, the sister\u2019s information, and a description of the pet (if the cat is chipped giving the number too) the hospital is more likely to follow through and hold the pet. Not guaranteed since some staff \u201cdon\u2019t want to get in the middle of something so messy that could ruin their reputation\u201d but better than no chance at all."]}
