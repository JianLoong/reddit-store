I'm in a tough spot right now and feeling pretty guilty about recent events. I need your judgment to help me figure out if I'm the one in the wrong. Here's what happened:About two months ago, I had to go out of town for an important work trip, leaving behind my beloved cat, Whiskers. \n\nSince I couldn't take him with me, I asked my sister, who lives nearby, if she could take care of him temporarily. She agreed, and I felt relieved knowing that Whiskers would be in good hands.Fast forward to last week when I returned from my trip. I contacted my sister to make arrangements for Whiskers to come back home. \n\nShockingly, she refused to return him, claiming that my apartment is too small for him and that he's better off with her. I was taken aback and didn't know how to respond initially.To give some context, my apartment isn't huge, but it's certainly not unsuitable for a cat.   \nWhiskers has been living with me for two years, and he's always been happy and healthy. I provide him with everything he needs and ensure his well-being. There have never been any concerns about his living conditions until now.After failed attempts to reason with my sister, I felt desperate and made a decision that I now regret. \n\nI called the police to intervene and help me retrieve Whiskers. It was a drastic step, and I realize that now. The police did visit my sister's place, but unfortunately, they couldn't do much since it's a civil matter. They advised us to resolve it privately or seek legal assistance if necessary\n\n.As if the situation wasn't stressful enough, my parents got wind of what happened, and they're absolutely livid with me. They believe I overreacted and didn't give my sister a chance to work things out amicably. \n\nThey argue that calling the police was excessive and that it has strained our family dynamic.Now I'm left feeling guilty and questioning if I went too far. Should I have tried harder to resolve this issue peacefully? Am I the asshole for involving the police and causing such turmoil in our family? I genuinely want what's best for Whiskers, but I fear I may have damaged my relationship with my sister and parents in the process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for calling the police on my sister and now facing the wrath of my parents?
