I'm in a tough spot right now and feeling pretty guilty about recent events. I need your judgment to help me figure out if I'm the one in the wrong. Here's what happened:About two months ago, I had to go out of town for an important work trip, leaving behind my beloved cat, Whiskers. \n\nSince I couldn't take him with me, I asked my sister, who lives nearby, if she could take care of him temporarily. She agreed, and I felt relieved knowing that Whiskers would be in good hands.Fast forward to last week when I returned from my trip. I contacted my sister to make arrangements for Whiskers to come back home. \n\nShockingly, she refused to return him, claiming that my apartment is too small for him and that he's better off with her. I was taken aback and didn't know how to respond initially.To give some context, my apartment isn't huge, but it's certainly not unsuitable for a cat.   \nWhiskers has been living with me for two years, and he's always been happy and healthy. I provide him with everything he needs and ensure his well-being. There have never been any concerns about his living conditions until now.After failed attempts to reason with my sister, I felt desperate and made a decision that I now regret. \n\nI called the police to intervene and help me retrieve Whiskers. It was a drastic step, and I realize that now. The police did visit my sister's place, but unfortunately, they couldn't do much since it's a civil matter. They advised us to resolve it privately or seek legal assistance if necessary\n\n.As if the situation wasn't stressful enough, my parents got wind of what happened, and they're absolutely livid with me. They believe I overreacted and didn't give my sister a chance to work things out amicably. \n\nThey argue that calling the police was excessive and that it has strained our family dynamic.Now I'm left feeling guilty and questioning if I went too far. Should I have tried harder to resolve this issue peacefully? Am I the asshole for involving the police and causing such turmoil in our family? I genuinely want what's best for Whiskers, but I fear I may have damaged my relationship with my sister and parents in the process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for calling the police on my sister and now facing the wrath of my parents?

You can stop that by making her listen to words.\u201d\n\nJust every time, redirect. \u201cYou\u2019re right, the family dynamic is strained - because she stole my pet.\u201d \u201cYes, there should have been an amicable resolution, like her returning my pet when asked, not stealing my pet.\u201d \u201cTalking to me doesn\u2019t return my pet to me, talk to her about returning my pet.\u201d The problem was created by her, return the problem to sender socially as well as legally.\n\nSpeak to a lawyer, issue a letter demanding return of your animal, then go to court to compel return. Once your pet is safe, change your locks and never allow your sister in your home again. If any harm befalls your pet, cut your sister off completely and remind your parents that they can side with the animal abuser if they want, but you don\u2019t have to associate with her or them if that\u2019s their choice.", "NTA. If someone kidnapped my cat, family or no, I would explode in righteous fury and they would WISH i had merely called the police.", "NTA. Your sister strained the family dynamic by not returning your cat. Fuck that. Also I\u2019m certain her saying your apartment is too small is just the first excuse she could think of to try and keep your cat because she likes your cat and just doesn\u2019t want to return it.", "Did you get whiskers back yet?? If not, even after the police visit, that's proof enough that there's no reasoning with your sister.\n\nEither way, NTA", "NTA. She stole your cat. She's the one at fault here. Parents are enablers too and that sucks, and is quite akeen to gaslighting.\nGet a friend or two to come with you to your sis's and retrieve Whiskers.

Cats are sacred beings. \ud83d\udc3e", "Honestly, I hate that you involved the cops but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make you TA.

Your cat is your property, and this being the case, how is it not criminal that your sister has stolen your cat?  And if this is an expensive breed of cat over the amount that makes theft a felony, how is your sister not arrested?\n\nYou might want to head back over to the police station and find out why they could intervene if your sister stole your shoes, but not your cat.  (Both property.)  Have someone explain it to you and perhaps show you the statutes in question.  Why is it a criminal matter when someone steals a necklace but not when they steal a cat?\n\nI'm confused, but then, I'm not a lawyer or a police officer.  \n\nIMHO, you didn't go too far.  Your sister stole your beloved cat.  How were you supposed to get him back?  What was there to work out?  \n\nI would suggest that you collect your vet bills and photos of you with your cat, and possibly paperwork from the vet as well, or from the rescue or wherever you got Whiskers, and go talk with a lawyer if you don't have Whiskers back yet.\n\nYou didn't damage your relationship with your sister.

Whiskers is yours.", "NTA get Whiskers back! Call a lawyer!", "Idk man dick move from your sister, you could have called your parents first but I wouldn't say calling the police was a dick move either. Just deceive her with some afternoon tea and a chat and take him back home if they can't do anything, what's she gonna do? Bit weird she's just gone and stolen your cat", "NTA. Your sister crossed the line. Kitty justice is serious business.", "You call police when someone kidnap your family member, so that was a decent move.

Work it out like adults, purrlease.", "Is the cat chipped? Do you have vet records that prove your ownership? Did you pay for food/litter/upkeep while you were gone? These are all things you may have to prove to get your cat back. \n\nMy husband passed away last year, and I knew the cat I 'inherited' was chipped to him, and I could not find any vet records for the cat, so the first thing I did was get the chip reprogrammed to my information and make sure his shots were up to date. \n\nNTA, your sister is being awful about this, but your only legal case may lie in these technicalities.", "NTA. OP if anything, you are drastically UNDER REACTING. Your sister STOLE your cat and you're here on reddit asking if you're an asshole... no no no now is the time to raise HELL and get YOUR cat back.

You already talked to her and she refused. How much more amicable can you be?\nContinue to ask for your cat that she won't give back?\nYou shouldn't have to beg for your pet. \nI would press charges for theft. Your fam needs to stop enabling her. I'd give them one chance to talk some sense into her before you press charges for the sake of amicability.", "If it were me, id honestly just break down their door, take back the cat and then pay for the door repair afterwards.

She would end up with a hefty fine and a criminal record if she refused to hand back your property.", "NTA but why the flying fuck do you care about someone who stole a living fucking creature from you?! why do you care so much what your sister thinks if she doesnt care about you enough to just take your fucking cat and tell you to fuck off? why do you care about your mother if she is siding with your cat stealing sister? these are not people hwo give two fucks about you, so very obviously. So stop giving a fuck about \"strained family dynamics\" and bust that door down and get your damn cat", "If it were me, the cops would definitely have been called... because I'd be on her lawn in full Mad Max leathers and feathers, screaming \"BRING ME HER FLESH LEATHER!\" I would straight up lose my shit if someone kidnapped my cat.", "Unfortunately, yes, the *extremely* calm cadence rang false to me as well.", "I was wondering this since Whiskers is such a generic name.

A few people told me that me having to pay 800$ plus food a month to live in a hot garage while taking care of all the kids in the house and doing all the cleaning isn't normal so they offered for me to move in at 1am the morning I had to go travel to bury my mom who we had to cremated due to finding a time all of us could bury her together  that morning she found out I was leaving and her easy money and her not having to work was going away. Everyone in that house was in the process of moving as it was to a bigger house. She had told Mei couldn't get any of my stuff including my 2 hamsters back until I give her 2k bucks.  She kept harassing myself and both my sisters the night before we were to bury our mom I called the cops. With her having stole everything I had owned minus what I had packed for a trip including my pets the cops stated that they can not do anything about it that it is a civil matter. \n\nI didn't get anything back because I couldn't keep traveling to and from the place i had moved too and they had moved so I couldn't find them  and since I learned that day the cops wouldn't help I had to give up", "I'm pretty sure dogs are property, but in a lot of places cats are counted as free-roaming and not as actual property, I guess it depends where you live.", "I have a feeling sister fell in love e with whiskers and cat ownership snd feels like she's the better owner and instead of buying her own catbfeels thefts the way to go", "This is insane to me.
