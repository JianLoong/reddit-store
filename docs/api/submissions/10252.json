When we get there we were seated at a booth and we ordered our food and it was given to us. Like 12 minutes later a old women came up to us with our waiter next to her. She said the restaurant was full and her husband had recently died, and this was the exact booth he and her would sit with there two children every year on this exact date (in the 80s before it was always packed). Our waitress gave us that \u2018I\u2019m so sorry look\u2019. We were all really confused and my mom explained that we had waited forever to get this seat and it\u2019s her sons birthday.

The manger ended up coming out and said he was sorry and that he could give us a full refund if we gave up our seat but when we asked if we could rebook he said they were full for the rest of the week.

You spent a ton of time and energy to get a reservation on the date you wanted. I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s a hostess stand or some kind of set up where you check in before you proceed to be seated. Whoever let her back there to put you all on the spot was the AH. The manager who wanted you to leave after you were seated was the AH. They needed to be sympathetic, find a future solution, or talk her into waiting until your party was finished so she could sit there afterwards. Why did she need to be seated in that exact moment? The fact they allowed her to approach you all, put you on the spot, and then tell you they\u2019ll refund you, but not allow you to rebook the rest of the week? Really awful management. That spoiled the rest of your night. Yes, it\u2019s sad and heartbreaking her spouse recently died, but this sounds like a grief impulsive decision to come up to the restaurant. I understand wanting to be there on that particular date, but the restaurant could have figured out something to make some phone calls to move another party that was coming in later to another day, etc. to accommodate her if they felt so inclined to make something happen for her.", "NTA. She could have waited until you finished dinner.", "NTA - the restaurant, knowing how hard it is to get reservations - should never have put you in that situation.

You did nothing wrong by your family wanting to finish your meal there.", "No, NTA.  Apparently this is a restaurant that\u2019s in high demand.

She or one of her kids can make a reservation for this week next year or literally any other time.", "NTA.  She should never have been allowed to approach you unless they had an alternate table immediately available for you to use.", "NTA. It\u2019s a rough situation to be in, but you are not obligated to give up your seat to someone who didn\u2019t make a reservation. It would make me feel bad but I would\u2019ve made the same decision and I\u2019m pretty sure most of the people giving you dirty looks would do the same", "NTA \nIt sounds like your parents tried to accommodate and nothing would fly with this woman. She wanted YOUR table for her and her alone. I can't help but feel like she has done this before at this restaurant since they let her so casually come up to your table. As a person who has worked in restaurants for almost 10 years that shit would never fly. She should have gone to the manager who then should have come to ask you directly AND ALONE to talk to you about the situation and then move forward from there. She came up to you with the intention that you would say yes. Not trying to sound heartless about her situation, if it's true, but your brothers birthday is important too. I hope this experience didn't ruin his day", "NTA \n\nThe restaurant was terrible for putting you in that position. \n\nHow dare they bring a crying old lady to your table. \n\nI would leave a review for the restaurant and ask for the entire meal to be comped and speak to the manager. \n\nI would be SO FURIOUS if someone dared spoil my night at an expensive restaurant like that. \n\nFurious!", "NTA\n\nI assume you wouldn't have cared if there were another equally-acceptable booth or table available - not one next to the restroom.   As the restaurant was otherwise full, you could hardly be condemned for staying in that booth.  Too bad for the lady, but \"them's the breaks\"!", "NTA - your father should write a Yelp review", "NTA - and that restaurant was WAY out of line to even let it get as far as it did. As a person in a SERVICE industry, the manager should have known better and just turned the lady away. Sucks for her, but you can't always get what you want.\n\nYears back, my husband took me to a very small, but well known, restaurant. It was a pricey, prix fixe place with 2 seatings at 5pm and 7pm. It was usually 8-10 weeks out for reservations.\n\nLong story somewhat shorter, a group of six came in about 20 minutes late and demanded to be seated. However, their reservation was only for four (and, indeed, there were four empty seats). The host told them that they were late, but could be seated,  however the reservation was for four, not six, and only four could be seated. They went ballistic and *insisted* the restaurant made an error, and that they were \"owed\" accommodation. There is no way there was an error, as the restaurant calls to confirm ALL reservations a few days beforehand, so the \"error\" would have been caught then.\n\nAnyway, these people made such a royal stink that the owner, who was also the head chef, was called out from cooking to deal with it. And, he ultimately DID accommodate the two extra people, which involved me and my husband, as well as about TWENTY other people, moving seats to accommodate these two extra people.\n\nWe, and the other patrons, were LIVID. We had already begun our meals and were forced to move, bringing our water and wine glasses with us, while the wait staff moved the plates. Unbelievable. On top of that, we were given NO consideration other than a \"We're so sorry, thank you for your patience.\" Honestly, while the food was good, my mood in the wake of it wasn't. I didn't enjoy the meal because of it (honestly, we should have just left at that point the musical chairs started) and never returned to the restaurant again (the restaurant has since closed, small wonder...)\n\nWhy, on God's green earth, the host just didn't turn these people away is beyond me. She simply could have said \"You've missed your seating, the meal has already started. When do you want me to rebook you?\"", "NTA - Sad and not sure what I would have done.", "NTA, sounds like she should have made a reservation.", "NTA for sure! The people at the restaurant behaved liked AH\u2019s, why would they even allow her to approach you to begin with!?!?!", "I'm calling BS on this lol. I've worked in plenty of restaurants and they don't just escort guests over to ask you to move. Mgmt doesn't comp your food to move lol.", "I think I\u2019ve seen this story before\u2026.", "NAH - this could have/should have been handled better by the manager. For example let the lady wait, offer you the meal free for trying to finish quickly, move you a different table as soon as available and discount or at least take your dad's offer of giving him a reservation with free meal the following days. Surely they could have made it work somehow.\n\nAnyway, awkward and kinda shitty situation. I don't think anyone is the asshole. The old lady is a little entitled. It's sad her husband passed but still... you and your family are not to blame but maybe could have helped find a compromised like eating quicker, asking for a different table and the manager should have never even put you in this position in front of the rest of the restaurant. He should have handled it quietly if anything or asked the lady to wait...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You booked the table, you were seated, it was all yours.

That's an extremely unprofessional restaurant. That woman should have never been brought to the table and she could have booked in advance just like your father did.

With reservations it's first come first served. You snooze, you lose. Being a widow doesn't give someone the right to demand priority over things.

From a business practicality standpoint, it makes no sense to give up the revenue from a single order to a seating arrangement that can accommodate a whole party. The problem is management placed the moral thing to do squarely on OP. That shouldn\u2019t have ever been a situation their dinner experience was subjected to. If the manager felt that strongly about making this happen where they felt they needed to put someone on the spot about it, then that manager should have picked up the phone and offered to rebook a later reservation and comp the meal for them.

Nobody is more entitled to be there, and to sit at a specific seat, just because they are going through something. If she was a regular at this restaurant she would know they have a booking policy, and if this meant so much to her she should've booked like everyone else. As far as I'm concerned, management should've said to the woman \"I'm sorry but we are fully booked and it's not fair on our other customers to change their plans. Every customer is valued and bookings are first come first served. I'm more than happy to take bookings now for future dates for you to secure your booking, and put a note on the booking that you specifically want table X.\".", "This did not happen", "NTA.
