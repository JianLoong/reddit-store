Meanwhile he hasn\u2019t heard back from any apartments so he cannot move here yet.\n\nMy grandparents decided to help with my tuition this year and wrote me a cheque for a decent portion of it.\n\nI told my boyfriend I was going to deposit my cheque at the bank but ultimately could not end up doing the deposit because of fees and the deposit wait time. So I took the cheque back to discuss a solution with my grandparents later.\n\nEver since I was on way home he\u2019s been texting me bugging for a picture of the front of the cheque. I kept telling him why he wants to see the cheque and that it\u2019s just any other normal cheque. But he said that \u201cOh my mind just wants to see it and I won\u2019t be satisfied until I do.\u201d\n\nI offered to show a portion of it over video call but I refuse to text a picture in case my account or his gets compromised and someone takes the picture and does something with it.\n\nNow he\u2019s refusing to text me until he sees a picture. He refuses to do a video call to see it and only wants a picture. I don\u2019t know why but I don\u2019t trust putting things like this out there. I\u2019m just trying to take some safety measures.\n\nHe\u2019s never been so nosey over a piece of money before. I told him it\u2019s my check and I can do what I want with it. But he still refuses to talk.\n\nAITA?\n\n*****Update:*****\n\nIt\u2019s been three hours and I know for a fact he is off work but he still hasn\u2019t texted. I\u2019m not going to reply or say anything or start conversation. It\u2019s simply childish at this point. Thanks all for the advice and I wasn\u2019t going to show the cheque under any circumstances. If anything else comes up I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\n******Update 2:******\nOkay so he\u2019s replied like 4 minutes after I posted that first update.\n\nHe sent a picture of an example of a cheque and coloured out the numbers on the bottom. And told me to \u201cSend it like this\u201d. \n\nAfter that he sent a text a blob of text, \u201cI'm that type of person to repeat words until I get it. Even if it's years n I wouldn't care about it anymore but I will get it eventually then get rid of it after the sight.\u201d\n\nAnyway I\u2019m not going to reply for a bit until I can think of an appropriate response. I\u2019m currently not in the headspace for it.
