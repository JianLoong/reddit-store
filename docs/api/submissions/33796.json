You got them what was on the list. Your ex is just being a jerk. You spent the same, or more for the boys, their gifts are not cheap. You are fine, more than fine in all of this.", "NTAH. They got what they wanted and were happy. Your ex needs to stay out of it. If the boys come to you and say something about  it, then you can go over it with them and fix it with them. She has no business saying anything to you. If the boys are hurt, then fix it and do better next year. Plain and simple", "You are not the jerk here. Don't let what Mom states to you bother you. She's just mad that you didn't get them more in the amount of material things for Christmas and you did for the girls. And basically it's none of her business how you deal with Christmas at your house. She needs to take her nose and stick it in her own business. I think if the situation were reversed and you got on to her for not getting the boys a more number of presents than what she did she would feel definitely the same way about it. When I was growing up, sometimes one of us would get a few more gifts than the other one and there was only two of us in the family. When we got older to realize that Santa was not exactly there anymore, my mom told us that they always manage to spend as close to the same amount on each of us even if one of us got a few more gifts than the other one. And it's not likely even knew the difference anyway because mom made a lot of our gifts, and dad made some of them, but what they did buy as far as the number we never really knew. I know I made a big deal out of it either.", "NTA\n\nYour boys are old enough to understand that the amount of gift they received was smaller compared to their sisters because the gift they got have a bigger price tag. Sounds like all of you kids where happy with what they got. The amount of the gifts received is also reflective of the kids ages. \n\nYour EX doesn't seam to understand the concept that it is not about quantity and is more about quality of the gifts given and is using this as away to attack you and make you feel guilty and you have nothing to feel guilty about.", "NTA, the older kids are old enough to understand that the value of the items they asked for is equal to the value of a number of less expensive toys added together. And it serms they did. So if they understand their mother should too.", "NTA\n\nThe gifts may not be as many, but I'd hazard to guess that you spent the same amount for each child (possibly more on the boys). None of what you got the boys was cheap. Little kid toys can be cheaper, therefore the same amount of money buys more.\n\nSounds like your ex-wife just wanted complain. Tell her that the amount of gifts was different, but the costs were not.", "NTA AT ALL. You were Great Dad. And Great Job, Santa!!! You got Everyone what they wanted\u2014and spent Equally. \n\nOf course the girls got more gifts in terms of number of gifts. Does your ex know how much Airbuds cost and how many toys on little girl\u2019s list would equal one Airbud purchase?? \n\nSo, your Ex is being unreasonable\u2014and had no business making a fuss, calling you, and making you question yourself. That\u2019s just awful behavior. No offense, but that\u2019s likely why she\u2019s your Ex. \n\nSo, chin up, Santa. You were Great Dad, and Great Santa, to ALL your kids Equally. And everyone loved and enjoyed their gifts. What a Beautiful Thing. Many kids do not get such nice Christmas or equality. But YOU did that. Great Job!, Santa Dad!!! Keep up Great Work. Don\u2019t let her get to you, please. \n\nIf you have to, explain to your boys how you went to great lengths to give to all your kids equally\u2014and that you hope they\u2019ll do the same one day so you can proudly watch them play Santa Dad. \n\nMerry Christmas, Santa Dad.

Then that's all that matters. They got exactly what they asked for.", "Nope. My kids know that I spend roughly the same amount of money on each of them. Sometimes, that means one kid has a few more presents because the stuff they wanted was less expensive. I'm a very thoughtful gift giver.\n\nExample: 13 year old son wanted an expensive lego set. 11 year old girl wanted makeup brushes. So, girl got more gifts because makeup brushes are a hell of a lot less expensive than a huge Lego set. But they both got exactly what they wanted for their \"wow\" gift and a few other things. My 16 yr old's big ask was 2 volumes of his favorite Manga Comics. So again, he got a few more gifts than the 13 yr old.", "NTA The older kids get the more pricier their gifts become.

We try to do things like \u201cspend the same\u201d, \u201csame number of objects\u201d, etc.  all of those are fine but it\u2019s not really the point. \n\nYounger kids in my experience sometimes get more objects simply because older kids objects tend to be more expensive. Some kids just want more expensive things, some don\u2019t. \n\nIf your kids are happy, mission accomplished. Nothing else really matters.", "NTA\n\nYou spend the same amount, not get the same number of things. A $100 gift card doesn\u2019t equal a doll.

Same rules apply here.", "NTA  You got them what they wanted. We have always spent an equal amount on each kid. You didn't specify but it sounds like the ex is bent over quantity rather than $$$", "NTA.  Your ex is complaining about quantity.

I guarantee your sons understand, at 16 and 14, that if you ask for bigger ticket items, you get fewer actual items.  Your ex is being absurd.", "As long as you spent the same amount of money on them all, it doesn't matter. \n\nNTA. My kids knew that at the age of 8.

I grew up in a blended family with 5 children and not much money. We all got a Xmas budget. So some years, older kids might get 1 or 2 gifts, while younger kids got several smaller, less expensive things. We all got the same spent on us, we just might end up with a different number of things. \n\nAs long as you are spending the same amount, and the older kids are getting things they asked for, you are doing right by all of them.

We try to spend roughly the same amount on both boys. \n\nAlso, how does your ex know what you spent on your girls?", "That's so silly.  Those boys are old enough to recognize the cost difference between their gifts and cheap toys for small children.

It's shitty that they went and complained to the other parents instead of talking to you about their feelings.", "To make gift giving equal it has to go one of two ways:\n\n- Equal amount of gifts. \n- Equal amount of money spent - not necessarily equaling the same amount of gifts. \n\nYou did exactly that.

And did your sons talk to you about this?", "NTA - you and your current wife are the only parents of your current 2 girls, so of course they get the full gift experience from the two of you. You split your 2 boys with your ex, so they would in turn have 2 Christmases, 1 from you and 1 from your ex - so therefore they'd either then have more toys than the girls or the same amount.
