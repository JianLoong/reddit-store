We have been working hard to try and make this work, but keep arguing about things money, sleep and not feeling recognized for our contributions. \nWhen I was about 4 months pregnant, I sat my boyfriend down to have a discussion about my maternity leave. I wanted for us to both be on the same page about how long I would be taking and that I would not be paid while on maternity leave. We agreed that I would take 12 weeks of maternity leave and that was our plan. \nA few weeks before our baby came, my boyfriend and I spoke about the upcoming events and I told him that I was going to need help paying rent. He became upset, I apologized for the miscommunication and then he helped me pay rent for the 12 weeks that I was on maternity leave. So he made 3 rent payments. \nNow, awhile later, our hospital bills have arrived and he informed me last minute that he will not be splitting them with me because he helped me with rent. Even though every discussion we\u2019ve had leading up to this, even after my leave already started, we agreed that we would split them. \nMy boyfriend makes six figures and three times my annual salary\u2026 Well he did, but he quit his tech job to spend more time with us on maternity leave. But that actually turned into him starting his own business which is another reason that he is complaining to me that he can\u2019t afford to pay the hospital bills that we have both been aware of for some time now. \nAm I the asshole for being upset that he is bailing on me last minute for splitting the hospital bills? I want to support him with his career and dreams, but this feels unfair. Am I the asshole for thinking that this is unfair of him after he helped me with my rent while I was on maternity leave?", "created_utc": 1690905907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fgrs8/aita_boyfriend_doesnt_want_to_split_hospital/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Quit his job with a baby on the way? That\u2019s such an AH move. Also 12 weeks is really not much time to recover. You\u2019re NTA OP and your boyfriend needs to choose between helping you now or having to pay court mandated child support.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a wake up call for you. You are poor. You are on the verge of homelessness. Your wealthy boyfriend is refusing to help you support your child together. \n\nThis is only the beginning. You need to make sure he is on the birth certificate, and you need to start thinking about filing for child support. \n\nIt's only going to get worse from here. He is going to fight you over everything - the baby's food, the baby's clothes, your rent, your food, your medical bills, school, daycare. He is never going to support this child. You are going to be begging him for the rest of your life. If you discuss it with him, he will make you a promise, and then go back on it later, just like he did here.\n\nHe is going to keep financially abusing you until you break. \n\nOR, you can get a lawyer, and sue him for child support. \n\nBasically either you do it now, or you do it in a few years after  fucking up your kids childhood with his abusive withholding tactics. I would get started ASAP. Seems like you already made the poor decision of having a kid with this asshole, the only question is are you going to make your child suffer for your poor decision, or are you going to take responsibility and get your child the money they are owed. Are you ready to step up and be a parent, or are you gonna beg this guy for the rest of your life?", "NTA. Tell your boyfriend his choices are to pay or to go to court to figure out court mandated payments. Not paying for his child is not an option. When you mentioned him quitting his job my first thought was he did that to make his income appear lower if you try to take him to court.", "NTA. Your boyfriend has shown you that his first priorities will always be money and himself.\nNot you. Not your baby.", "NTA.\n\nLet's rewind for a moment. You sat your boyfriend down months in advance of your due date to talk about maternity leave and to prepare him for the fact that you would be without any income for a few months. You also reminded him of this a few weeks before baby. Meanwhile, he ups and quits his 6-figure job to start a new business without really consulting you.  Why did it take the hospital bills to make you realize this is an inequitable relationship?\n\nFigure out how you are going to support yourself and your baby because this guy isn't it.", "NTA. Go to court for a custody agreement. He obviously isn't going to make this a fair an equal situation.", "You tried being reasonable and working this out with him parent to parent.  \n\nHe isn\u2019t holding up his half.  As you point out he can, but is refusing.  \n\nHis reasons and excuses don\u2019t matter anymore- you have to put the baby first. \n\n\nGet a lawyer and a court mandated child support.  NTA", "NTA but your boyfriend is though.  No parents in their right mind would quit their job without a sustainable plan B. He is obviously trying to skimp on his duties\u2026 like you said you would go on a unpaid maternity leave for 12 weeks, that should have been enough to understand you would have no revenues coming in to pay for all the expenses. \n\nOP this is financial abuse and you should prepare yourself, maybe talk to a family lawyer and/or get support from resource groups. \n\nLike another redditor posted, you\u2019ll be forever fighting him about money.  He\u2019ll always prioritize his well being above yours and the kids.", "NTA. In what is basically your greatest time of need, your boyfriend is failing you. Who quits their job with a baby on the way? Are you sure he wasn't fired? If he wasn't fired, then he seems to lack basic decision making skills.", "NTA\n\nWho are the parents of the baby? Is it just you? No. Both of you did. You taking maternity leave was a joint decision. It wasn't you taking time off for fun it was for a purpose. \n\nMaybe tell him if this is the way he feels he can pay for all the tuition fees for university when that comes up. This is the logic he is using.", "NTA that baby is half his responsibility. Witness this sign - get a custody agreement and child support set up.", "Did you reproduce by parthenogenesis? All alone without his contribution? Or is the baby his child too? Why the fuck does he think he doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the child\u2019s birth? NTA at all.", "Oooof. Your boyfriend sucks. Like really really sucks. You deserve better and I hope you can see that.\n\nYou are decidedly NTA", "NTA. But sheesh, him quitting while you have a newborn and on an unpaid leave was a terrible decision.\n\nAlso, what miscommunication? You decided, together, to take 3 months off. How else did he think he think the rent was going to be paid, lol?\n\nHe lives there too so how does him paying rent have anything to do with the hospital bill for birthing HIS CHILD?! he should help. Look into financial assistance though through their Billing department. Most hospitals have plans where, depending on your income, your bill can be significantly reduced, based on your income. They just don't advertise it.", "He needs to split the bills with you. Realistically, you needed to split the rent with him. So half of whatever he paid for your rent for 3 months could be subtracted from his half of the medical bills. That would be a 50-50 compromise. \n\nThe bigger issue is why you\u2019re having a child with a man who nickel and dimes the mother of his child into a 50-50 compromise and then quits his fucking job with a newborn. \n\nBut that ship has sailed. You now have a child with this man. And you\u2019re not married to him. Which means you need a paternity finding and orders for support unless and until you live together, at least. My personal opinion is you should break up with him, but that\u2019s not really the question you\u2019re asking.", "Get signed up for food stamps and whatever welfare systems you have where you are.", "Nta  take him to the cleaners\nBaby needs tombe raised proper\nHe\u2019s financially abusing you\nNta\nFile for benefits if you have too", "NTA - This is a tough situation. For me, this is a relationship breaker. It takes two to make a baby. He is as responsible for hospital bill as you are. He led you to believe he would take care of the finances and now he won\u2019t - and quitting to start is own business with a new baby means he is refusing to accept his responsibilities.\n\nIf it was me, I would start looking for a place to move to, find child care, find a lawyer, and talk to him a final time to see if he is willing to step up. If the answer is no, move out with the baby. You will get child support, but paying for daycare until then will be difficult. DO NOT accept a \u201clet\u2019s not get lawyers involved\u201d lower support agreement because he cries poverty or offers immediate help to pay for daycare - my sister did that and he never did pay the proper amount. It\u2019s possible you talking lawyers, child support, and moving out will wake him up, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. The longer you stay and the longer you are out of work, the harder - both emotionally and financially - it will be to move out.", "NTA. Bro, what. Wtf is wrong with your bf??? He\u2019s got a baby on the way so he decided to quit his well paying job and start his own business putting huge financial strain on you guys during this time? Dudes fucking stupid", "NTA and it sounds like you guys aren\u2019t supposed to be a family unit with the way he\u2019s treating your common expenses", "NTA Get a lawyer and dump his ass. When someone shows you who they really are believe them.", "NTA. But obviously you have to look at this for what it is: don\u2019t look at a future with this person because they are not looking for one with you. If this guy intended to stay or even marry you eventually, he would not be acting like this over HIS kid\u2019s medical bills (him paying your rent was above and beyond, but he did it). You need to look out for you and your kid and get a child support order going. You may think that it will end the relationship, but it is over. He is only calling you his gf to save money.", "NTA your boyfriend quit his job to avoid having to provide for his family.", "This is your boyfriends baby right, and, you decided to have the baby and raise it together?\n\nYour BF is definitely responsible for half the medical bills associated with birthing the child and subsequently.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds awful and is not acting like a parent.

Are you sure he wasn\u2019t fired?", "Short of going to court there's nothing you can do.\n\nI URGE you to go to court to get child supoort and custody arranged. You can ask the court to order him to pay half your pregnancy/birth related medical bills. He may counter with, \"But I paid her rent,\" and the court would likely deduct that amount from his half of the medical bills.\n\nOr, the judge might say, \"He wasn't obligated to pay the medical bills OR your rent.\"", "NTA - The baby is not just your responsibility. He should cover half the hospital bills since you have split finances. Also, I don't think there was a miscommunication that you needed to apologize for...he's just trying to get out of paying for his half.", "NTA\n\nYou need a lawyer.", "NTA. Take him to court for half of all pregnancy related expenses and child support.", "NTA. \n\nAlso I dunno if this is him pursuing his dream or reducing income and assets, so he doesn't have to pay any child support. \n\nI would assume you are a single mum and start planning your life accordingly.

Since you aren't married, he may not be financially responsible for all or part of the medical bills.", "Info: first your bf is an asshole. But what was your plan when you first talked? Because taking 12 weeks off couldn\u2019t be the full plan? I know you mentioned that you did not get paid during those 12 weeks so what was the financial plan during this originally conversation? Did you discuss how you were going to split up payments? I\u2019m not necessarily talking about the hospital bills (because if your in USA, your insurance is the AH, but also ask for an itemized bill, good chance it\u2019ll go down a smidge) but with rent, food, car payments?", "NTA. Get a lawyer, fast", "-Did he want his name on the birth certificate?\n-did he have sex with you causing the conception?\n-is he the father?\n\nThese are most likely a yes NTA.

Now.", "NTA, but I guarantee he's going to leave you and that's bad.", "Apply for child support and move out", "NTA. It's his child too. The hospital bills exist because of your baby.\n\nI'm concerned that he's not interested in the long haul if he thinks he's not responsible for hospital bills because he paid rent.

It has to be a partnership and you can\u2019t always do 50-50 when a baby is involved because for example :she carried the baby 9 months and is something he\u2019ll never be able to do.", "Many places force the husband onto the both certificate, which is a good reason to be married to a guy (or at least get to know his character) before you pop out his kid.\n\nNot knowing in advance is no reason not to fix it now, too.  So he wouldn't sign?  Force a paternity test.  Can't afford court filings?  Wow, you were not financially ready for a baby.", "> That is the law.\n\nlol no, but go off", "Yeah. Starting your own business is a great way to hide income. He's already taking steps.", "But does *he* know that?  I bet he doesn't.", "Yes, but that does depend on other factors like the timing and what other work he's done in the meantime. OP should look up legal aid in her area and get on this.", "Nah, if he doesn\u2019t have on the books income, they aren\u2019t going to assign shit. I used to work a lot with this population (deadbeat dads) and they\u2019ll take all sorts of off the books jobs because then they don\u2019t have to pay child support.", "I agree with you and that could be the case here. However there are others with 4 or 5 kids they can\u2019t afford. They can\u2019t all be accidents right? I mean maybe 1. 2 if you\u2019re an idiot and don\u2019t learn the lesson the first time. Wait they could be quintuplets so I guess yeah, could be an accident for them too. \n\nAll sarcasm aside, I do get it, accidents happen. It is just sad how many are in this situation and can\u2019t afford to support their child/family. It is a cycle that I fear will be worse due the the changing of abortion availability and rising inflation. Those living pay cheque to pay cheque (or worse) can\u2019t get ahead if they are having children without a way to support them.", "Sounds like this child was planned or at. Wet least, that they made a concerted decision to keep the child and raise it.", "You, there?\nYou're the jerk.\n\nOP was working full-time, OP and her partner were more than self-sufficient.  You're bringing your stereotypes about who has babies out of wedlock into a situation where they don't even apply.", "Lower class sort of thing? What kinda chair are you sitting on queen b?", "Literally yes , all she needs is a paternity test which can be court ordered if necessary. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re a delight but I won\u2019t be arguing with you anymore. I hope she takes him to the cleaners like any \u201cparent\u201d that tries to get out doing what they should for kids .", "And he doesn\u2019t need to until the judge tells him! ;)", "Self sufficient in this case means \"can one parent cope if the other bails?\" because self means one.  Considering *most* relationships fail, it's hardly an unforeseen outcome.  Planning for a child means planning to raise that child alone if need be, not just skipping blindly into the future while your kid suffers for your lack of foresight.\n\nMaybe anyone who would do that is actually the jerk, not some random commenter laying down facts.", "\ud83c\udfc5"]}
