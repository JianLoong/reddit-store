We have been working hard to try and make this work, but keep arguing about things money, sleep and not feeling recognized for our contributions. \nWhen I was about 4 months pregnant, I sat my boyfriend down to have a discussion about my maternity leave. I wanted for us to both be on the same page about how long I would be taking and that I would not be paid while on maternity leave. We agreed that I would take 12 weeks of maternity leave and that was our plan. \nA few weeks before our baby came, my boyfriend and I spoke about the upcoming events and I told him that I was going to need help paying rent. He became upset, I apologized for the miscommunication and then he helped me pay rent for the 12 weeks that I was on maternity leave. So he made 3 rent payments. \nNow, awhile later, our hospital bills have arrived and he informed me last minute that he will not be splitting them with me because he helped me with rent. Even though every discussion we\u2019ve had leading up to this, even after my leave already started, we agreed that we would split them. \nMy boyfriend makes six figures and three times my annual salary\u2026 Well he did, but he quit his tech job to spend more time with us on maternity leave. But that actually turned into him starting his own business which is another reason that he is complaining to me that he can\u2019t afford to pay the hospital bills that we have both been aware of for some time now. \nAm I the asshole for being upset that he is bailing on me last minute for splitting the hospital bills? I want to support him with his career and dreams, but this feels unfair. Am I the asshole for thinking that this is unfair of him after he helped me with my rent while I was on maternity leave?", "created_utc": 1690905907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fgrs8/aita_boyfriend_doesnt_want_to_split_hospital/", "score": 561, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Quit his job with a baby on the way? That\u2019s such an AH move. Also 12 weeks is really not much time to recover. You\u2019re NTA OP and your boyfriend needs to choose between helping you now or having to pay court mandated child support.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a wake up call for you. You are poor. You are on the verge of homelessness. Your wealthy boyfriend is refusing to help you support your child together. \n\nThis is only the beginning. You need to make sure he is on the birth certificate, and you need to start thinking about filing for child support. \n\nIt's only going to get worse from here. He is going to fight you over everything - the baby's food, the baby's clothes, your rent, your food, your medical bills, school, daycare. He is never going to support this child. You are going to be begging him for the rest of your life. If you discuss it with him, he will make you a promise, and then go back on it later, just like he did here.\n\nHe is going to keep financially abusing you until you break. \n\nOR, you can get a lawyer, and sue him for child support. \n\nBasically either you do it now, or you do it in a few years after  fucking up your kids childhood with his abusive withholding tactics. I would get started ASAP. Seems like you already made the poor decision of having a kid with this asshole, the only question is are you going to make your child suffer for your poor decision, or are you going to take responsibility and get your child the money they are owed. Are you ready to step up and be a parent, or are you gonna beg this guy for the rest of your life?", "NTA. Tell your boyfriend his choices are to pay or to go to court to figure out court mandated payments. Not paying for his child is not an option. When you mentioned him quitting his job my first thought was he did that to make his income appear lower if you try to take him to court.", "NTA. Your boyfriend has shown you that his first priorities will always be money and himself.\nNot you. Not your baby.", "NTA.\n\nLet's rewind for a moment. You sat your boyfriend down months in advance of your due date to talk about maternity leave and to prepare him for the fact that you would be without any income for a few months. You also reminded him of this a few weeks before baby. Meanwhile, he ups and quits his 6-figure job to start a new business without really consulting you.  Why did it take the hospital bills to make you realize this is an inequitable relationship?\n\nFigure out how you are going to support yourself and your baby because this guy isn't it.", "NTA. Go to court for a custody agreement. He obviously isn't going to make this a fair an equal situation.", "You tried being reasonable and working this out with him parent to parent.  \n\nHe isn\u2019t holding up his half.  As you point out he can, but is refusing.  \n\nHis reasons and excuses don\u2019t matter anymore- you have to put the baby first. \n\n\nGet a lawyer and a court mandated child support.  NTA", "NTA but your boyfriend is though.  No parents in their right mind would quit their job without a sustainable plan B. He is obviously trying to skimp on his duties\u2026 like you said you would go on a unpaid maternity leave for 12 weeks, that should have been enough to understand you would have no revenues coming in to pay for all the expenses. \n\nOP this is financial abuse and you should prepare yourself, maybe talk to a family lawyer and/or get support from resource groups. \n\nLike another redditor posted, you\u2019ll be forever fighting him about money.  He\u2019ll always prioritize his well being above yours and the kids.", "NTA. In what is basically your greatest time of need, your boyfriend is failing you. Who quits their job with a baby on the way? Are you sure he wasn't fired? If he wasn't fired, then he seems to lack basic decision making skills.", "NTA\n\nWho are the parents of the baby? Is it just you? No. Both of you did. You taking maternity leave was a joint decision. It wasn't you taking time off for fun it was for a purpose. \n\nMaybe tell him if this is the way he feels he can pay for all the tuition fees for university when that comes up. This is the logic he is using.", "NTA that baby is half his responsibility. Witness this sign - get a custody agreement and child support set up.", "Did you reproduce by parthenogenesis? All alone without his contribution? Or is the baby his child too? Why the fuck does he think he doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the child\u2019s birth? NTA at all.", "Oooof. Your boyfriend sucks. Like really really sucks. You deserve better and I hope you can see that.\n\nYou are decidedly NTA", "NTA. But sheesh, him quitting while you have a newborn and on an unpaid leave was a terrible decision.\n\nAlso, what miscommunication? You decided, together, to take 3 months off. How else did he think he think the rent was going to be paid, lol?\n\nHe lives there too so how does him paying rent have anything to do with the hospital bill for birthing HIS CHILD?! he should help. Look into financial assistance though through their Billing department. Most hospitals have plans where, depending on your income, your bill can be significantly reduced, based on your income. They just don't advertise it.", "He needs to split the bills with you. Realistically, you needed to split the rent with him. So half of whatever he paid for your rent for 3 months could be subtracted from his half of the medical bills. That would be a 50-50 compromise. \n\nThe bigger issue is why you\u2019re having a child with a man who nickel and dimes the mother of his child into a 50-50 compromise and then quits his fucking job with a newborn. \n\nBut that ship has sailed. You now have a child with this man. And you\u2019re not married to him. Which means you need a paternity finding and orders for support unless and until you live together, at least. My personal opinion is you should break up with him, but that\u2019s not really the question you\u2019re asking.", "Get signed up for food stamps and whatever welfare systems you have where you are.", "Nta  take him to the cleaners\nBaby needs tombe raised proper\nHe\u2019s financially abusing you\nNta\nFile for benefits if you have too", "NTA - This is a tough situation. For me, this is a relationship breaker. It takes two to make a baby. He is as responsible for hospital bill as you are. He led you to believe he would take care of the finances and now he won\u2019t - and quitting to start is own business with a new baby means he is refusing to accept his responsibilities.\n\nIf it was me, I would start looking for a place to move to, find child care, find a lawyer, and talk to him a final time to see if he is willing to step up. If the answer is no, move out with the baby. You will get child support, but paying for daycare until then will be difficult. DO NOT accept a \u201clet\u2019s not get lawyers involved\u201d lower support agreement because he cries poverty or offers immediate help to pay for daycare - my sister did that and he never did pay the proper amount. It\u2019s possible you talking lawyers, child support, and moving out will wake him up, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. The longer you stay and the longer you are out of work, the harder - both emotionally and financially - it will be to move out.", "NTA. Bro, what. Wtf is wrong with your bf??? He\u2019s got a baby on the way so he decided to quit his well paying job and start his own business putting huge financial strain on you guys during this time? Dudes fucking stupid", "NTA and it sounds like you guys aren\u2019t supposed to be a family unit with the way he\u2019s treating your common expenses", "NTA Get a lawyer and dump his ass. When someone shows you who they really are believe them.", "NTA. But obviously you have to look at this for what it is: don\u2019t look at a future with this person because they are not looking for one with you. If this guy intended to stay or even marry you eventually, he would not be acting like this over HIS kid\u2019s medical bills (him paying your rent was above and beyond, but he did it). You need to look out for you and your kid and get a child support order going. You may think that it will end the relationship, but it is over. He is only calling you his gf to save money.", "NTA your boyfriend quit his job to avoid having to provide for his family.", "This is your boyfriends baby right, and, you decided to have the baby and raise it together?\n\nYour BF is definitely responsible for half the medical bills associated with birthing the child and subsequently.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds awful and is not acting like a parent.

Are you sure he wasn\u2019t fired?", "Short of going to court there's nothing you can do.\n\nI URGE you to go to court to get child supoort and custody arranged. You can ask the court to order him to pay half your pregnancy/birth related medical bills. He may counter with, \"But I paid her rent,\" and the court would likely deduct that amount from his half of the medical bills.\n\nOr, the judge might say, \"He wasn't obligated to pay the medical bills OR your rent.\"", "NTA - The baby is not just your responsibility. He should cover half the hospital bills since you have split finances. Also, I don't think there was a miscommunication that you needed to apologize for...he's just trying to get out of paying for his half.", "NTA\n\nYou need a lawyer.", "NTA. Take him to court for half of all pregnancy related expenses and child support.", "NTA. \n\nAlso I dunno if this is him pursuing his dream or reducing income and assets, so he doesn't have to pay any child support. \n\nI would assume you are a single mum and start planning your life accordingly.

Since you aren't married, he may not be financially responsible for all or part of the medical bills.", "Info: first your bf is an asshole. But what was your plan when you first talked? Because taking 12 weeks off couldn\u2019t be the full plan? I know you mentioned that you did not get paid during those 12 weeks so what was the financial plan during this originally conversation? Did you discuss how you were going to split up payments? I\u2019m not necessarily talking about the hospital bills (because if your in USA, your insurance is the AH, but also ask for an itemized bill, good chance it\u2019ll go down a smidge) but with rent, food, car payments?", "NTA. Get a lawyer, fast", "-Did he want his name on the birth certificate?\n-did he have sex with you causing the conception?\n-is he the father?\n\nThese are most likely a yes NTA.

Now.", "NTA, but I guarantee he's going to leave you and that's bad.", "Apply for child support and move out", "NTA. It's his child too. The hospital bills exist because of your baby.\n\nI'm concerned that he's not interested in the long haul if he thinks he's not responsible for hospital bills because he paid rent.

So sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "def start making sure he'll pay child support, if he NTA doesnt wanna pay then he gets no more kids. thats stupid selfish, he should be taking care of half of this situation.", "Court-ordered child support, ASAP. Don't wait on this. And you may be able to get the court to order a division of the medical bills associated with the birth, as well as your child's health insurance. Again, don't wait on this. Your BF has shown you who he is. Act accordingly. NTA.", "Totally correct. I would never have a kid without the basic protections of marital property. NTA.", "Someone who thinks that will get him out of paying child support, that's who.", "My sister gave birth uninsured for 75k. She\u2019ll be posting $10 a month until she dies or they write off the debt. \n\nI gave birth on state insurance (basically universal healthcare) and spent zero dollars and got my iud free. Then I got kicked off insurance and haven\u2019t been to the doctor in 5 years. \n\nMy bestfriend who\u2019s husband is military (and has great insurance as a result) paid like 3k", "He thinks it will get him out of paying child support,  It won't work.  Judges don't like it *at all* when would-be deadbeat parents play that sort of game to try to avoid their obligations.", "Guarantee quitting his job was so he won't be ordered to pay child support.  Of course that's not how it works, but he probably doesn't know that.", "The only victim here is the baby.", "Don't tell him jack, OP.  All that does is give him yet another opportunity to lie and manipulate and bully you.  Just file.", "That's not going to work if he ever actually finds himself in front of a judge.", "He's trying to avoid child support in case OP files.  \"Judge, I don't have any income right now, so I shouldn't have to pay anything.\"  I guess he's not aware that isn't how it works.", "We separated briefly post baby and he begged me relentlessly to come back w baby. Honestly, I wish he would bc it would make all of this a lot easier for me.", "As far as I know he quit. I told him it was okay if he saved up the national average for a years salary and if I wouldn\u2019t impact baby or me negatively.", "Child support may be figured on potential earnings (depends on the state and sometimesjust what judge you get). Many absent parents quit their jobs and take a lower paying position figuring it will lessen CS. Judges aren't usually amused. So even if he was making just barely 6 figures, that's likely to be what CS is based on regardless of what he's making now.\n\nIt also doesn't matter if he signed the birth certificate. All she has to do is name him and he'll be ordered to 1. Take a paternity test or 2. Ordered to pay child support, including back support, which he can then attempt to fight or pay.", "Good luck with that. Get a hard ass judge and they'll look at what he was making, assume he quit in order to dodge child support and figure it on his potential earnings. And backdate it.", "I mean she thought they had a plan. He went back on it.", "If someone changes the plan right behind your back or has ulterior motives when you otherwise thought they were trustworthy, then you\u2019re at fault for believing lies?", "\"Hi, Tommy, hi Sarah, I'm gonna come over to their house today. I'll see you both then, at the house you both live at.\"\n\nThis is how words work in second person.", "So why don\u2019t you do a paternity test, leave him, move home, apply for foodstamps, and get child support", "How old are you and the BF? It really seems like you both were not prepared for this baby at all. Was it planned? Unplanned? With a huge wealth disparity between you and you seemingly not living together, it doesn\u2019t give the impression this baby was a mutual next step in your relationship.", "Many hospitals have financial assistance programs that will discount your bill by a percentage based on your income and family size (you can usually make a lot more than Medicaid-qualifying levels and still get some discount). So that might be worth asking your hospital's billing department about.", "Gonna have to put your foot down and be the one to pull the trigger, if that's what you really want. You know the situation the best, but this can easily turn into something you'll wish you've done sooner a couple years down the line.", "Whew, I\u2019m sorry to say this but this man played you. I\u2019m not sure how serious this relationship was or how long you two dated before the pregnancy came, but your boyfriend is on his way to being a dead beat dad. It\u2019s scary how men can quickly change for the worse once a pregnancy/baby is in the picture. As far as the hospital bill, maybe see if you can enter some sort of payment plan to pay the bill. NTA", "That's how a lot of men try to get out of child support.", "In some jurisdictions if he *completely relinquishes his parental rights*, he will not pay anything, whether or not paternity is proven. I want to say *usually* there has to be a stepparent prepared to step in for this to be the case but I\u2019m not certain about every state. I was a child of such circumstances, I kinda doubt mine was a 1-off anomaly.\n\nFrom the picture OP is painting, I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath on this dude fighting for any sort of visitation or other parental rights/privileges.", "Maybe I misspoke. But from what I\u2019m reading she waited until AFTER she was pregnant to discuss finances. Ideally you would get pregnant once you are financially stable but hey life happens.", "Well gosh, I didn\u2019t think of that. If it\u2019s so easy, why don\u2019t you have a baby with someone who you thought you were in love with and then leave them while you\u2019re still recovering from having a baby?", "This\u261d\ufe0f", "There is no jurisdiction in which he can unilaterally relinquish parental rights and then avoid child support, thankfully. If it were that easy, it would happen a lot more often. \n\nThat said, she needs to go ahead and start the legal process for having him acknowledged as the baby's father and move forward on child support.  Thank god for DNA tests and imputed income. How that income is imputed varies wildly state to state, but I don't know if any that have nothing on the books regarding imputed income.", "I have never heard of ANY jurisdiction in which a biological parent can simply say \"I give up all parental rights\" and get out of child support unless it's pursuant to adoption (either by a stepparent or through an agency). If one parent is raising the child, the other will be paying child support whether they are involved in the child's life or not.\n\nYou can abort a baby but the only way you can abort your financial responsibility to the child once is born is through giving it up for adoption.", "I understand this is stressful..you are going to be ok, and so is baby. But you are gonna need to take those steps sooner or later. No need to do it today... But you do need to start preparing now. The birth certificate especially is a priority. If you don't, he can abandon you and pay nothing.", "[deleted]", "Really.  Why do women choose to end a pregnancy? This story is Exhibit A.", "It's her burden to prove paternity at this point. She should get to work on that ASAP and file for support. Although, with his newfound business, they probably will just impute him at minimum wage.", "I've probably attended 100 family court hearings, personal and work related, and a vast majority of the time judges won't order people to pay money that does exist. Who is to say he'd ever get another good job?\n\nWhat I generally see is the man getting imputed at minimum wage or their partner's salary. If they have one. Also, trying to get as much money as possible leads to ugly custody disputes and abuse. \n\nSome parents will take a child they can't stand to pay less. I'd rather just raise my baby myself and dip. Right now he has zero rights. He isn't even legally the father. He's not on the birth certificate, they aren't married, and there has been no paternity test. \n\nOP also has no marital protections like joint property. It's not a great situation and if he wants to be an asshole he can make her life a living hell. In retrospect, I wish I had just been a single parent.", "Most courts will make him pay a portion if not all of the birth fee.", "Ok, so the stepparent part would be a key factor from what I knew. Glad for OP this is the case.", "This is a disgusting take and only this sub\u2019s rules are keeping me from telling you what you can do with it.", "These words have never felt quite this insufficient, but I am SO sorry for your loss.", "Yes, OP, you do have agency in this situation.  Please go file for child support.  Don't believe bf when he tells you that the judge won't order him to pay anything because he has no income.  That's not how it works.", "It\u2019s never going to happen given this dad clearly has no interest in being a parent, so OP should absolutely call him on the bluff if he tries it.\n\nIf he\u2019s going to financially abuse her in order to avoid his responsibility, make him take responsibility by playing dirty.", "Right. I get that she didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I said it probably feels like a committed relationship from the inside.", "> Please go file for child support.\n\nShe has to establish legal paternity first thanks to information she conveniently left out of her OP but mentioned in comments.", "I agree . I had two step kids when we had my son and then the recession hit and our relationship was not good. I\u2019m sad every day that I only got to raise one kid ( I was super close with my step- daughter before she moved out of state but they have their own mom) . I knew we couldn\u2019t afford any more kids and it wouldn\u2019t have been fair to any of the kids we did have.  I live in a poor community and people just keep having kids without a worry. I work with kids and pay for snacks for them. I\u2019m sad every day as my son is almost done high school but I know I made the right decision."]}
