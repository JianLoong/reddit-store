We have been working hard to try and make this work, but keep arguing about things money, sleep and not feeling recognized for our contributions. \nWhen I was about 4 months pregnant, I sat my boyfriend down to have a discussion about my maternity leave. I wanted for us to both be on the same page about how long I would be taking and that I would not be paid while on maternity leave. We agreed that I would take 12 weeks of maternity leave and that was our plan. \nA few weeks before our baby came, my boyfriend and I spoke about the upcoming events and I told him that I was going to need help paying rent. He became upset, I apologized for the miscommunication and then he helped me pay rent for the 12 weeks that I was on maternity leave. So he made 3 rent payments. \nNow, awhile later, our hospital bills have arrived and he informed me last minute that he will not be splitting them with me because he helped me with rent. Even though every discussion we\u2019ve had leading up to this, even after my leave already started, we agreed that we would split them. \nMy boyfriend makes six figures and three times my annual salary\u2026 Well he did, but he quit his tech job to spend more time with us on maternity leave. But that actually turned into him starting his own business which is another reason that he is complaining to me that he can\u2019t afford to pay the hospital bills that we have both been aware of for some time now. \nAm I the asshole for being upset that he is bailing on me last minute for splitting the hospital bills? I want to support him with his career and dreams, but this feels unfair. Am I the asshole for thinking that this is unfair of him after he helped me with my rent while I was on maternity leave?", "created_utc": 1690905907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fgrs8/aita_boyfriend_doesnt_want_to_split_hospital/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Quit his job with a baby on the way? That\u2019s such an AH move. Also 12 weeks is really not much time to recover. You\u2019re NTA OP and your boyfriend needs to choose between helping you now or having to pay court mandated child support.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a wake up call for you. You are poor. You are on the verge of homelessness. Your wealthy boyfriend is refusing to help you support your child together. \n\nThis is only the beginning. You need to make sure he is on the birth certificate, and you need to start thinking about filing for child support. \n\nIt's only going to get worse from here. He is going to fight you over everything - the baby's food, the baby's clothes, your rent, your food, your medical bills, school, daycare. He is never going to support this child. You are going to be begging him for the rest of your life. If you discuss it with him, he will make you a promise, and then go back on it later, just like he did here.\n\nHe is going to keep financially abusing you until you break. \n\nOR, you can get a lawyer, and sue him for child support. \n\nBasically either you do it now, or you do it in a few years after  fucking up your kids childhood with his abusive withholding tactics. I would get started ASAP. Seems like you already made the poor decision of having a kid with this asshole, the only question is are you going to make your child suffer for your poor decision, or are you going to take responsibility and get your child the money they are owed. Are you ready to step up and be a parent, or are you gonna beg this guy for the rest of your life?", "NTA. Tell your boyfriend his choices are to pay or to go to court to figure out court mandated payments. Not paying for his child is not an option. When you mentioned him quitting his job my first thought was he did that to make his income appear lower if you try to take him to court.", "NTA. Your boyfriend has shown you that his first priorities will always be money and himself.\nNot you. Not your baby.", "NTA.\n\nLet's rewind for a moment. You sat your boyfriend down months in advance of your due date to talk about maternity leave and to prepare him for the fact that you would be without any income for a few months. You also reminded him of this a few weeks before baby. Meanwhile, he ups and quits his 6-figure job to start a new business without really consulting you.  Why did it take the hospital bills to make you realize this is an inequitable relationship?\n\nFigure out how you are going to support yourself and your baby because this guy isn't it.", "NTA. Go to court for a custody agreement. He obviously isn't going to make this a fair an equal situation.", "You tried being reasonable and working this out with him parent to parent.  \n\nHe isn\u2019t holding up his half.  As you point out he can, but is refusing.  \n\nHis reasons and excuses don\u2019t matter anymore- you have to put the baby first. \n\n\nGet a lawyer and a court mandated child support.  NTA", "NTA but your boyfriend is though.  No parents in their right mind would quit their job without a sustainable plan B. He is obviously trying to skimp on his duties\u2026 like you said you would go on a unpaid maternity leave for 12 weeks, that should have been enough to understand you would have no revenues coming in to pay for all the expenses. \n\nOP this is financial abuse and you should prepare yourself, maybe talk to a family lawyer and/or get support from resource groups. \n\nLike another redditor posted, you\u2019ll be forever fighting him about money.  He\u2019ll always prioritize his well being above yours and the kids.", "NTA. In what is basically your greatest time of need, your boyfriend is failing you. Who quits their job with a baby on the way? Are you sure he wasn't fired? If he wasn't fired, then he seems to lack basic decision making skills.", "NTA\n\nWho are the parents of the baby? Is it just you? No. Both of you did. You taking maternity leave was a joint decision. It wasn't you taking time off for fun it was for a purpose. \n\nMaybe tell him if this is the way he feels he can pay for all the tuition fees for university when that comes up. This is the logic he is using.", "NTA that baby is half his responsibility. Witness this sign - get a custody agreement and child support set up.", "Did you reproduce by parthenogenesis? All alone without his contribution? Or is the baby his child too? Why the fuck does he think he doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the child\u2019s birth? NTA at all.", "Oooof. Your boyfriend sucks. Like really really sucks. You deserve better and I hope you can see that.\n\nYou are decidedly NTA", "NTA. But sheesh, him quitting while you have a newborn and on an unpaid leave was a terrible decision.\n\nAlso, what miscommunication? You decided, together, to take 3 months off. How else did he think he think the rent was going to be paid, lol?\n\nHe lives there too so how does him paying rent have anything to do with the hospital bill for birthing HIS CHILD?! he should help. Look into financial assistance though through their Billing department. Most hospitals have plans where, depending on your income, your bill can be significantly reduced, based on your income. They just don't advertise it.", "He needs to split the bills with you. Realistically, you needed to split the rent with him. So half of whatever he paid for your rent for 3 months could be subtracted from his half of the medical bills. That would be a 50-50 compromise. \n\nThe bigger issue is why you\u2019re having a child with a man who nickel and dimes the mother of his child into a 50-50 compromise and then quits his fucking job with a newborn. \n\nBut that ship has sailed. You now have a child with this man. And you\u2019re not married to him. Which means you need a paternity finding and orders for support unless and until you live together, at least. My personal opinion is you should break up with him, but that\u2019s not really the question you\u2019re asking.", "Get signed up for food stamps and whatever welfare systems you have where you are.", "Nta  take him to the cleaners\nBaby needs tombe raised proper\nHe\u2019s financially abusing you\nNta\nFile for benefits if you have too", "NTA - This is a tough situation. For me, this is a relationship breaker. It takes two to make a baby. He is as responsible for hospital bill as you are. He led you to believe he would take care of the finances and now he won\u2019t - and quitting to start is own business with a new baby means he is refusing to accept his responsibilities.\n\nIf it was me, I would start looking for a place to move to, find child care, find a lawyer, and talk to him a final time to see if he is willing to step up. If the answer is no, move out with the baby. You will get child support, but paying for daycare until then will be difficult. DO NOT accept a \u201clet\u2019s not get lawyers involved\u201d lower support agreement because he cries poverty or offers immediate help to pay for daycare - my sister did that and he never did pay the proper amount. It\u2019s possible you talking lawyers, child support, and moving out will wake him up, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. The longer you stay and the longer you are out of work, the harder - both emotionally and financially - it will be to move out.", "NTA. Bro, what. Wtf is wrong with your bf??? He\u2019s got a baby on the way so he decided to quit his well paying job and start his own business putting huge financial strain on you guys during this time? Dudes fucking stupid", "NTA and it sounds like you guys aren\u2019t supposed to be a family unit with the way he\u2019s treating your common expenses", "NTA Get a lawyer and dump his ass. When someone shows you who they really are believe them.", "NTA. But obviously you have to look at this for what it is: don\u2019t look at a future with this person because they are not looking for one with you. If this guy intended to stay or even marry you eventually, he would not be acting like this over HIS kid\u2019s medical bills (him paying your rent was above and beyond, but he did it). You need to look out for you and your kid and get a child support order going. You may think that it will end the relationship, but it is over. He is only calling you his gf to save money.", "NTA your boyfriend quit his job to avoid having to provide for his family.", "This is your boyfriends baby right, and, you decided to have the baby and raise it together?\n\nYour BF is definitely responsible for half the medical bills associated with birthing the child and subsequently.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds awful and is not acting like a parent.

Are you sure he wasn\u2019t fired?", "Short of going to court there's nothing you can do.\n\nI URGE you to go to court to get child supoort and custody arranged. You can ask the court to order him to pay half your pregnancy/birth related medical bills. He may counter with, \"But I paid her rent,\" and the court would likely deduct that amount from his half of the medical bills.\n\nOr, the judge might say, \"He wasn't obligated to pay the medical bills OR your rent.\"", "NTA - The baby is not just your responsibility. He should cover half the hospital bills since you have split finances. Also, I don't think there was a miscommunication that you needed to apologize for...he's just trying to get out of paying for his half.", "NTA\n\nYou need a lawyer.", "NTA. Take him to court for half of all pregnancy related expenses and child support.", "NTA. \n\nAlso I dunno if this is him pursuing his dream or reducing income and assets, so he doesn't have to pay any child support. \n\nI would assume you are a single mum and start planning your life accordingly.

Because taking 12 weeks off couldn\u2019t be the full plan? I know you mentioned that you did not get paid during those 12 weeks so what was the financial plan during this originally conversation? Did you discuss how you were going to split up payments? I\u2019m not necessarily talking about the hospital bills (because if your in USA, your insurance is the AH, but also ask for an itemized bill, good chance it\u2019ll go down a smidge) but with rent, food, car payments?", "NTA.

Now.", "NTA, but I guarantee he's going to leave you and that's bad.", "Apply for child support and move out", "NTA. It's his child too. The hospital bills exist because of your baby.\n\nI'm concerned that he's not interested in the long haul if he thinks he's not responsible for hospital bills because he paid rent.

It\u2019s really not about the money, but the way he uses it as a tool against me.", "Me thinks the same thing.", "It's weird that bf quit his job right after having a child. If anything, someone should be getting a job because they have a kid now unless they have the money.\n\nStarting a business with a newborn in tow is again very weird.", "I wonder if he quit his job so his income would change for child support when she sues him.  \n\nBecause he knew he wasn't going to contribute to the hospital bills and likely that she would sue him.", "this! I have an example in my wider circle where the couple spent years doing just fine and in a great relationship - just for abuse to start when the baby was born.  hard to comprehend, but it definitively happens", "and? that's a very stupid thing to do immediately after having a kid...", "Yea, the \u201cit will all work out when the baby is here\u201d approach is\u2026 interesting. And, unfortunately, seems to be pretty common.", "You really better be on birth control and should consider breaking up and suing him for child support and hospital bills", "But \"your\" can be plural. It wouldn't make any sense to say \"their\" grammatically. Although the bf seems to think of it as *her* baby, since it makes sense to him to pay for the hospital bills, as if they are the mother's and not the baby's.", "And the boyfriend sounds PROFOUNDLY disinterested in being a father. \n\nHas this always been his attitude? Was the baby planned at all? Has he ever been enthusiastic about parenthood? \n\nI get that choice goes both ways, and the baby's here and there's nothing OP can do about that, but ugh. This is tragic.", "Where did she say this pregnancy was planned?", "What is more concerning is him going from making 3x your salary to quitting his job, and now pushing you into a corner. It's like... It's premeditated. Don't know how child support is calculated where you are, but please do speak with a lawyer about all options.", "Oh, he understands.  He just doesn't care.  He has rewritten the situation so that you, and only you, are responsible for the financial burdens of being pregnant and writing a baby.  This is a choice, not a \"does not understand\".", "I understand you're upset but you said that his income is gone. Are you sure he's not understanding? Maybe he just doesn't have the money. Did you both discussed him changing jobs? Because you seemed to have covered it all. Was it a surprise for you him quitting is job?", "Unless you lawyer up, it is going to be you, as a single mom, paying for everything, including having to pay off the hospital bill, and another dead beat \"parent\" getting away with any financial consequence.", "Stop trying to negotiate with him. Go get a lawyer & get a court order child support order now. You baby needs a roof over its head now. Your baby needs food now. You baby needs diapers now. You need something legally enforceable or he\u2019ll always have a reason why he can\u2019t give you money now. Even as you move with your child into a shelter. Even as you & your child go hungry. He\u2019ll always have a reason why his money is needed for his ventures.", "hol' up he refused to do what?!  \n\n\nFriend, I'm sorry, but you need to get a lawyer.", "HE WOULDN\u2019T WHAT?!\n\nHomie dismissed himself from *any* legal responsibility for this child from day 1. He\u2019s fully prepared to walk away. He\u2019s probably thinking forfeiting rights (or, never accepting them, I guess) will allow him to walk away without child support obligations later. And he might be right, depending on where you are. \n\nI\u2019d consult a family lawyer, like, yesterday", "That is such a massive red-flag;  If he hesitated or did not sign the birth certificate, you need to go straight to a lawyer.  He wants to be daddy, not legally be a father and that is a problem for you.", "That\u2019s unacceptable. He\u2019s doing all of this to avoid paying for his kid. Go talk to a lawyer now. He\u2019s not going to help you voluntarily.", "I\u2019m so sorry OP, please consult with a lawyer, your BF is treating you and the baby in an unacceptable way and you need to begin to take steps to protect yourself, it\u2019s in yours and the babies best interests.", "They have a baby together and he makes - well, made - three times what she does, why does she even have her own rent?  Why haven\u2019t they gotten a place together?  The rent is irrelevant to the hospital bill regardless, it\u2019s not like he owes her a fixed sum.  He owes her equal responsibility - not an equal dollar amount - for their child for the next 18 years at least.", "Oh really?! OP leave!", "He wouldn\u2019t sign the birth certificate. It may seem like a committed relationship from the inside but it doesn\u2019t look that way to any of us.", "If he was in such a hurry, why wouldn't you guys at least get legally married. People don't \"wound up\" pregnant, you both chose not to use contraceptives. Regardless, get a lawyer, you need to realize he isn't going to be around for the long run and you have to make sure your baby can have the financial support he needs.", "But every adult in the US knows that \u201che said\u201d is unenforceable and that if a single woman decides to keep the baby, she needs to ensure that the court system is brought in to ensure child support. This isn\u2019t brand new. You knew this; you just buried your head in the sand.", "Good for you, but he needs to pay his fair share. In his eyes, he has since he paid your rent and you aren't married. He is treating you like a roommate. Idk how why not  signing the birth certificate wasn't an immediate breakup. I would have kicked him out and be on the phone with a lawyer before he made it to the door. You deserve better. Your baby deserves better. Take your time, but  start an exit plan.", "You said he paid rent for all 3 months. You should have saved enough money before the baby was born to pay rent.", "Sweetheart, don\u2019t you ever diminish yourself because of this. You are not an idiot. \n\nYou should be able to trust your partner\u2019s words and promises. You believed in your relationship. He is the AH who went back on his words and promises. \n\nTake this as the opportunity to see his true colors. He has removed his mask (at least partially) and you are seeing reality. I see this as him thinking \u201cmy money is mine, this baby is hers so she gets to take care of it.\u201d And that\u2019s not how this works. He holds 50% responsibility of the life he helped bring into this world. You need to start taking strides to protect yourself and your baby. Consult with a lawyer. Reach out to a domestic violence support center (they have a wide knowledge of resources and can put you in contact with assistance programs you wouldn\u2019t have even thought to have looked at). \n\nYou are not an idiot.", "> So tell me, what exactly did he pay a lot more for?\n\nYou answered your question here:\n\n> He paid for my rent\n\nThat's more than he had to pay for.\n\nIf you didn't want those expenses, you shouldn't have risked getting pregnant.", "Exactly. He uses it against you. You are being financially abused. I\u2019d argue emotionally and kinda physically too if he won\u2019t help you after you just got out of the hospital. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to wait for him to leave you. Get off Reddit and start making plans. Talk to a lawyer about how to file for child support. \n\nThis man shows no care for you or your child. It sucks that you made a baby with this AH, but now it\u2019s time to step it up for the sake of your baby.", "He\u2019s def tryna dodge paying child support", "He knows he wants nothing to do with the child and intends to boot them to the curb. He didn't claim paternity and quit his job to avoid child support. Now he will find some under the table job and make her go through the courts to petition for a paternity test, wait for the results to come back, then go through the process of trying to get child support. That could take years if he tries dragging it out. Months at best.", "Yes! The mother of my child is on unpaid maternity leave does not typically call for quitting the only source of income you have as parents. \nHe kind of knew a baby was coming.  And now, he can't afford splitting the costs, because he's spontaneously starting a business.  Very irresponsible", "Probably, but my state will order child support based on the income potential of the non custodial parent so deadbeats can't just get away with quitting.  My exh hadn't worked in 10 years when we divorced but he was ordered to pay 197/mo based on imputed minimum wage income.\n\nFile a paternity action, file for custody and support, and call it a day.", "Yes!! I know that in the US, homicide/intimate partner violence is one of the leading causes of death for pregnant women - it\u2019s definitely not happening in every relationship, but I really hate it when people judge women for this (and even more now with restricted abortion access)", "I thought my husband was an amazing person but half way through my pregnancy he suddenly went cold, withheld all affection, stopped saying he loved me, and started getting financially abusive and would start arguments all the time. \n\nOur son ended up passing away. My husband immediately left me. Eventually came back, then had an affair.\n\nI'm divorced now and I'm STILL blindsided and confused as to how/why my husband that I loved and thought was a good person, who I thought I had a great life with, could suddenly become a horrible, deceitful, abusive person.", "Not if you\u2019re trying to hide income to avoid child support.  You can\u2019t garnish what you don\u2019t know about.", "And the point is she thinks it\u2019s not fair even though he took care of her part when she wasn\u2019t bringing in any money. So why can\u2019t she do it for him? Why can\u2019t she support him? Just like he did for her? It doesn\u2019t matter if she had a baby, what matters is the principle behind it", "AITA would be nothing but wedding drama if people actually planned ahead when creating a family. \n\nFor me this is an ESH.  Really not sure what OP expected, but she better face the reality yesterday.", "Fair", "I told him that he could quit his job as long as it wouldn\u2019t have a negative impact on our family. He said he had a certain amount of money saved and another job lined up. He knew about all of these expenses before he quit his job.", "And OP was able to know this in advance, with her powerful precognitive powers?", "Exactly! And sure, she\u2019ll be able to get child support, but getting him to pay the medical bills for the birth? That varies greatly from state to state. In my state, only 50% of the cost of the pregnancy and birth can be recouped from the father of the baby.\n\nETA: And depending on how much her rent is, the court may say that he\u2019s already paid his portion by paying her rent.", "Yes, because I took the risk of getting pregnant all by myself. \n\nI have offered my to pay him the rent back multiple times. And he says no and that it\u2019s okay. He only brings it up as ammunition against me.", "Wth?? Sounds like AH bf is the one pushing her to have a baby. It's both their responsibility. He owed half for all expenses and childcare and anything that baby needs.", "\u201cNo\u201d income, wouldn\u2019t sign birth certificate, he\u2019s financially checked out of this kid\u2019s life already.", "So sorry for your loss of your son. You're better off without your ex, however.", "Very sorry for your loss.", "I understand what you\u2019re trying to say but when it comes to the baby that\u2019s a different thing.\n\nThe hospital bills weren\u2019t for her. They were for the delivery of the baby of which he is the father.", "It sounds like she tried to plan, but he isn\u2019t cooperating with the plan.", "That was a naive decision. Of course quitting a stable high paying job to start your own business is risky and will have a negative impact. Doing it with a newborn is not smart timing. The average time it takes for a business to break even is 3 years. Not to mention all the overtime he needs to put in. You\u2019re going to be raising the baby solo for a long time.", "Ok. But at the time of the talk, he agreed to the hospital expenses. Your rent came as a surprise for the financial plans. I mean, if he's paying your rent + his and his utilities. I assume he paid for baby stuff. I mean, maybe it's not that he doesn't want to split that bill. He just can't afford it. And it's hard for a new parent to come to the realisation that he can't afford the perfect life he planned. And I don't think he's being inconsiderate since the purpose of quitting his job was to spend more time with you during maternity leave and then, ultimately with you and his child.", "It\u2019s fascinating how so many AITAs are due to what are essentially teenagers who are woefully unprepared for work or self-sufficiency then making babies with others in the same boat.  It\u2019s a very lower class type of thing and perpetuates poverty.", "I'm trying to show you that you have agency in this situation, but you seem determined to believe that you don't, so best of luck.", "I'd hardly call a half assed conversation about splitting expenses \"planning for a child,\" or she wouldn't be scrambling now.  Of course it's \"unfair,\" which is the question she asked, but the truth is that it's unfair to that baby to have one parent unwilling and another unable to care for them.  Hopefully it all works out, but I really doubt it.  They've been fighting since the baby came, and clearly aren't going to be a successful family.  At this point, it doesn't even matter anymore that the boyfriend lied and that it was wrong to do that (duh), what matters is what she's going to do about it now.  He's not going to see the light and step up just because strangers on Reddit agree that he should.", "I see where you are coming from, and I agree that communication could have been better about rent during maternity leave. And sure he said that\u2019s why he was quitting his job, but let me tell you\u2014 he yelled at me for interrupting his REM cycle when I was asking for a break after we first brought baby home. I had just given birth, had stitches down there and my partner refused to help me. \nHe has spent his paternity \u201cleave\u201d working on his side projects. Which is fine, but I need help with the baby too especially now that I\u2019m back at work.", "Exactly. \u201cAITA for being upset that\u2019s bailing?\u201d  No, you\u2019re not TA for being upset, but that and $5 will get you a latte at Starbucks. It doesn\u2019t matter if 10,000 Redditors all agree he\u2019s TA. What matters is that you get a lawyer and the appropriate child support in place.", "My dude, run.\n\nI was hesitant, as you can see in my other comment, but this is *not* a person you want to raise a child with. I\u2019m sorry you had to find out after the fact.", "You need to run.  this is really bad.", "Ah man. I'm very sorry you're dealing with this OP. Your boyfriend is a selfish asshat who was ignorant to what being a parent would mean, and is now surprised at how difficult it is, and how much time and money it takes.\n\nUnfortunately he is going to go one of two ways: 1) he will recognize how hard it is, realize that he was ignorant as fuck beforehand about what is involved, and step up, or 2) he will continue being a total asshole and you will be essentially raising that child on your own.\n\nThere isn't really an inbetween. When this happens, my experience is us guys either get it and change, or they don't, and they don't. I think, in your case, that it is pretty damn unlikely your guy gets it, but if there was ever a time, it is now.\n\nSit down with him and very clearly tell him that the situation is untenable, completely unfair to you, and either he changes and steps up, or you leave and he pays child support. Obviously not that bluntly (or I wouldn't put it that bluntly, but you do you), but you have to tell him in no uncertain terms that this will not continue as is and you will leave him otherwise. He needs this kind of shock to his system if he ever has a hope of getting it.\n\nNTA, not at all."]}
