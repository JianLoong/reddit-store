{"id": 9481, "submission_id": "10xa50l", "title": "AITA for refusing to watch my husband's dog?", "selftext": "I will try to cut right to the chase. I'm 30f and I have 11yo triplets. 2 boys, 1 girl. I'm currently 13 weeks pregnant and on bed rest. It's important to note that my kids are very self sufficient and independent and know how to do pretty much everything themselves. They were raised on a farm, know how to cook, clean up after themselves, very respectful, etc etc. Their father, who passed when they were 6, was a damn good man and I led by his example in raising our children. They are kind souls, just like their dad. Point being, they are easy kids. They get home from school, tend the farm chores, do their homework and then usually we then play board games or video games together. \n\nSince being on bed rest, I've been incredibly tired and my immune system is currently shot. For the past maybe 3 days I've been doing a lot of sleeping while fighting off bronchitis. My husband gets home at 4pm and he has been doing a lot of the cooking recently. I haven't asked. I've been up to cook. He simply takes over and said he wants me to relax. But ever since I have refused to take care of his dog today, he has made me believe this was transactional, versus him helping me out. He has a 2yo Boxer mix of sorts that his mother gifted him last year. The dog is extremely high maintenance and chaotic. The amount of energy this dog has is something I have still yet to grow used to. She flies through the house and leaves destruction in every corner. Well, today I'm feeling slightly better than I was yesterday but I'm exhausted and it's my husband's day off. I have the dog every day, except his days off. My husband wanted to go to the parts store and to his buddies house afterwards to work on his truck and was projected to be gone on the ups of possibly 5-6 hours depending. He asked me to keep his dog here when he went to leave around 11am. I said no, I didn't want to watch the dog- as I felt like I was going to pass out from pure exhaustion. I needed to get some sleep. He asked again, stating he didn't want to bring his dog with him and have to keep an eye on her because she has been known to run off and I again said no. I was going to lay down and take a nap and I wasn't going to chase the dog around myself when I felt this way. Especially considering I'm supposed to be on bed rest as is and I haven't been following doctor's orders because I have to chase this dog around daily because she is constantly breaking free of her leash and harness. He got angry and said \"I've been watching the kids and making dinner every night for almost a fucking week and you can't even keep an eye on the dog for me?\" So I responded with \"Oh, I didn't realize this was transactional for you. I never agreed to take care of the dog but you offered to do what you've done. I'm not watching the dog.\" He slammed out of the house with the dog and has sent a text saying he needs space because \"you've become selfish and entitled since becoming pregnant\". AITA?\n\nETA: he won't let the kids watch or help with the dog anymore following an incident where my son needed 14 stitches. He was walking her and she broke through her leash and when the chord came flying back, it sliced my son's hand.", "created_utc": 1675888893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xa50l/aita_for_refusing_to_watch_my_husbands_dog/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Best to you.", "ESH. Hear me out.  Your husband is definitely the AH. You are supposed to be on bed rest.

If that was truly the Drs order then why aren\u2019t you following it.  Did the Dr. say that you are supposed to be on bed rest except when you feel like getting up and doing some cooking?  You say you have been doing that.\n\nYes, he is being transactional and he should not be.  But it sounds like he is watching you pick and choose when you follow the Drs. Orders.  That can be confusing to someone looking at your behavior. He should be angry at you about that.
