Yeah, don't bring whomever you're dating at the time. But if you're serious about someone, or engaged, or married, is the rule still going to hold fast? \n\nYou've been dating current girlfriend for 8 months.

Being all \"Sure, but jsyk  you're banned from the home lol!\" is asshole behavior. \n\nAnd if she's really important to you, it might be time to renegotiate the arrangement with your former partner. It's one thing to say \"This space shouldn't be used for sexy weekend getaways with a new fling.\" But at some point you'll have a new partner that will become part of your family and not allowing that family member to join you on family trips to the shared vacation home is shitty. \n\nAnd if it really comes down to it, it might be time to let the place that was never in your family to begin with go.", "YTA, this was not a sustainable or reasonable agreement.

What happens if either of you get married and have a family? You\u2019ll just never bring your spouse? This agreement is a big old death trap/sabotage to future relationships and is completely unacceptable honestly. \n\nTime to talk to your ex and explain that it\u2019s not sustainable to not bring your girlfriend.

I plan to go to Ireland to visit on X date so wanted you to know in advance the limitations of this property, and of course as we get more serious, this is an agreement I would need to look at down the line, like a year from now, as I know this wouldn't be an agreement that would work with a long term partner. \n\nSee, totally appropriate for you to go this time without her, and only reconsider the \"ban\" if/when you two make a long term commitment to each other down the road.
