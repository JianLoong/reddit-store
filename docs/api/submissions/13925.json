But, Jesus, handle your problems yourself. If you can't, shut up and get some professional help. \n\nJesus, fuck the lot of you teenagers. \n\nGo ahead, give me down votes and hate. I do not fucking care. Grow up and deal with it. Fuck off.", "Seems a lot like a rule two people who still had feelings for each other would make and stick too \ud83c\udf1a YTA", "YTA - The way you replied to her was too harsh. If I was dating someone and they told me I was banned from a place they go to without any valid reasoning I would be mad too. You could have explained the circumstances to her, that it's a co-owned property and there are rules both owners had to follow, instead of telling her she was banned. I'm sure she would be more understanding if you explained and suggested that instead of her tagging along with the friend group you could have a couple's vacation some other time. \n\nI would consider talking to the best friend tho, if this is someone you're serious about and wants a future with maybe it's time to revisit the no new flames rule. Things change, people change and adjusting rules to new situations seems reasonable. Maybe talk to the best friend and see how he feels about it", "\"It was his dad's engagement gift to us\"  \n\n\nIt was his dad's gift to his son and his son's future spouse. That's not you anymore. The moral thing for you to do would be to sign over your share of the house to your ex.", "So you want to go on vacation, in a foreign country, with your ex, in a place you got for your engagement, and where your current gf is banned from coming? \n\nYou should sell this property, or just get back with your ex already. \n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nI feel so bad for your girlfriend. I hope she leaves you", "This is absurd. And I'm 100% all for being friends with ex's in the right circumstances, even traveling with them. I'm not one of those \"all ex's must be blocked\" people at all, and even I think this situation is ridiculous. \n\nYour girlfriend is right to be pissed. At the very least, the minimum you could have done is offer to get a hotel away from the house *with* her. Suggesting she sleep alone in a hotel by herself is ludicrous, no self-respecting person would go along with that.\n\nYTA imagine if you were in her shoes.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019d hardly call an 8 month relationship a new flame. This could have been handled so much differently as well. \n\nYou could have said you\u2019d talk to your former partner as 8 months isn\u2019t a new relationship and it might be worth working out boundaries. Instead you made her feel as if she\u2019s just a \u201cnew flame\u201d and not serious. It\u2019s not necessarily about benign \u201cbanned\u201d, it\u2019s how you are defining your relationship, imo.", "It\u2019s a stupid rule.", "YTA stop wasting this girl\u2019s time when you\u2019re clearly using her and don\u2019t have genuine feelings of affection for her", "INFO: How do you collectively define \"new\" in \"new flame\"?

I have seen multiple stories of a man seriously hung up on his male ex (or in some cases just male best friend) who treats his girlfriend like shit because of it. There can't possibly be this many of this specific flavour of asshole running around.", "YTA - because you (subconsciously or not) doesn't seem to consider your gf a long-term partner, or your immediate response to her wanting to tag along wouldn't be to tell her to get a hotel by herself, but to renegotiate the terms of bringing a SO to the house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I obviously don't want to see him parading around Ireland with a hypothetical significant other. I doubt he wants to see me doing the same with my non-hypothetical significant other.\n\nThis comment shows that you're not only best friends but that there are still unresolved feelings there, otherwise this wouldn't be an issue.", " Was the engagement gift a gift assuming that you would get married and then you did not?  If so I think the ex deserves the entire property signed back over to him since his father gave the gift. I\u2019d say it the other way around if it was your father gifting it.  Sounds like YTA but need this info to confirm.", "I may be out of line here or just hopelessly confused but if I was the girlfriend of a man who had previously been so committed to another man that they were engaged, and that man wants to go on holiday with the ex fianc\u00e9 without me, I would be wondering if he was now the straight man that I thought I was in a relationship with. It sounds to me that this is very personal to her, especially if he still holds a torch for this man.", "Why would he buy you out if it was a gift from *his* family? That makes zero sense to me.", "Tell me you never had a relationship without telling me you've never had a relationship.", "EDIT: I misread. I think I'm in the ballpark with the conclusion, but my evidence for that conclusion was misinterpreted. Original comment left intact below:\n\n\"Our relationship\"\n\nVery telling. You next responses in this thread are even more damning, but this is a big giveaway. You consider yourself in a \"relationship\" with your ex. I'm not sure you consider yourself in a relationship with your actual gf.\n\nYou should figure out what sort of relationship you want in the future, and be honest with your self and your partner about that. I feel bad for your ex and your gf. YTA.\n\nEdit: My bad, I misread that. On a reread, it looks like those were ex's dad's words at the time of the breakup. I do think OP is still viewing things through that lens, but my take isn't the slam dunk I thought it was.

OP and her ex are still holding onto each other, which is unfair to any SO either of them have! It is clear that OP and her ex still have feelings for each other, because no one I know would be going on holiday with there ex and family excluding current SO. If my husband/bf did something like this to me there would be no relationship.  Most people would of sold the property either to the other party or to a third party.", "No, why would you obviously anything about his relationships? You are over, he can \"parade\" and so can you", "Why would you not want to see him in Ireland with a significant other? I don't understand. It sounds like jealousy. You don't want to see him happy? What kind of a shitty friend are you then?", "Same! I thought, \"Hmm, maybe someone else went in on his share? But then he'd say it was split 3 ways, not 2?\" I ended up setting that aside, but with the context now, looks like it was deliberate obfuscation."]}
