And You told your current girlfriend she is banned???", "YTA- it\u2019s not a very committed relationship if you are still tied this closely to your ex and you are taking trips to a foreign country where your current partner is banned from the accommodations. \nYou really thought it was a good idea for your current partner to come along and stay in a hotel by themselves while you stay in the vacation home with your ex?", "YTA, look at things from her perspective.\n\nYou co-own property with an ex across the world, not necessarily a cause for alarm, but not great, but hey, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not allowed to bring anyone romantic with you! \n\nEven worse, you *still* take trips to said place with said ex!???\n\nYou are taking trips with an ex that current flames are specifically banned from, and expect your current gf to think you\u2019re actually over that person?", "ESH --- is there an adult in the room that the 3 of you could consult?\n\nWhat exactly is being \"banned\" here? A virus? bedbugs? Or just an idea, a thought, a bubble from the past?\n\nHow does that square with making others happy, burying old hurts, living in the present moment?\n\nIs EX really going to die happy knowing that GF was successfully banned?\n\nAnd why do you tolerate this any longer?\n\nIf not now, when will this be resolved for once and for all. \n\nGF has a right to be miffed I guess.", "YTA", "YTA. Hard no on vacation with ex/best friend. Wildy inappropriate while you're in a relationship.  Can the ex not buy you out of the property? Talk about blurred lines.", "I get that it was an engagement gift from the ex's father, but once they called off the engagement, the property should have been returned to the father/left with the ex, regardless of why they broke up. What happens when the ex gets married and/or has children. Are they not allowed to visit the property? The longer this lasts, the more heartache it's going to cause.", "Friend, dating someone for 8 months is most definitely filed under \u201cnew flame.\u201d\n\nFor Christ\u2019s sake, I mean, it\u2019s not even a year yet.", "But if the ex has respected the deal and hasn\u2019t brought their partner, it wouldn\u2019t be fair for op to take his gf.", "Yeah, Op could've handled it better i guess. \n\nBut gf *invited herself* and is now pissed, so ...", "LOL right?  \"No baby, nothing nefarious is going on, I just own a vacation home in another country with my ex where the two of us are the only ones allowed to abscond to it and no of course you can't come, I told my ex I would never allow you to set foot there, now don't forget to give us a call when you get to the bog you'll be sleeping in for the weekend\"", "Because engaged is... not married? Engagements can be broken.", "Yeah, even if you're like \"well okay this sucks but at least I *do* still get to use this bomb vacation house,\" you still have to have the sense to append \"...for now\" onto that.", "> Is the question really AITA for going on vacation with my ex and telling my gf she has to stay somewhere else?\n\nIt's more \"AITA for wanting to get back with my ex and using my current relationship as an obvious placeholder until that happens?\"", "> Honestly the No New Partners Allowed rule is really silly and juvenile.\n\nYeah, that's some real \"just because we're graduating high school doesn't mean we won't stay best friends 5ever!\" energy.", "Egh, not day one, but definitely before she had to listen to this dingus talk about the trip in front of her for fuckin' *weeks*.", "> The only thing you\u2019re not doing is having sex with your ex anymore.\n\nThat's what this \"no girlfriend allowed\" trip is to accomplish, lmao", "I don't know about long-term arrangements. I'm sure he'll buy me out at some point in the future (and I'll readily allow it for much less than I could probably make off of the whole thing) but this is the current situation. It would be nice for us to continue owning it together just because it has so many memories, not just of times we were romantically together, but beyond that. I love traveling with him and our families. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>it indicates that your friendship with your ex isn\u2019t as healthy as you say it is.\n\nSo far, this is the first issue we've run into.", "Are you sure you are not still dating your ex? Because it sounds like it", "Sounds like you and your ex have some serious unresolved issues around your breakup.", "This was confusing. So you were married to a man but now have a girlfriend of 8months? Am I getting this right? If so as a man myself I would rather see my ex with a girl than another guy that would all be staying together. Unless there's just feelings still involved on his behalf. Either way it would be hurtful if there is. But it would be easier seeing my ex with a woman than bringing some dude I don't know to our Co owned place. As u said yall stayed good friends so that leads me to believe they have at least both met before?", "Agreed.", "Yeah, it absolutely should have gone to the ex in the split. Sharing it this way is nonsensical.", "Maybe if you\u2019re 20 or something. If I spend eight months with someone, you better believe it\u2019s because I see a future with them.", "That house is their little haven where they time travel back to the good days and re-light the passion. Hence the rule", "It\u2019s also just weird to want to go on vacation with your ex to the exclusion of your new partner. Like, of course this isn\u2019t a sustainable setup!", "OP. If you consider your ex \u201cfamily\u201d but don\u2019t consider your S/O as family you need to let her know that.", "I'm not sure I would call them 'issues,' or even label them as particularly serious. He and I have been around family and friends together post-breakup loads of times without making anyone uncomfortable since we still get along so well.", "Your age argument should be the opposite.  I\u2019ve spent longer than 8 months on my toilet in my lifetime.  Should I marry my toilet, too?", "It seems likely that OP is receiving some post breakup passion with their ex during their time in the house", "Civilized, emotionally intelligent people go on a vacation with their ex and tell current S/O they can come but need to sleep elsewhere?", "Get along with, sure. I get along with my ex. We shared custody of pets for 2 years (and stopped the arrangement for other reasons.)\nBe besties with, travel with, still own property with (and banning significant others from said property??)\nNah. That's a deal breaker for a lot of people. OP admits the marriage failed because of distance, not a lack of compatibility or love.\nThe only reason you co own property with your ex, and ban them from bringing new partners there, is because you hope you'll be back together.", "God you're a walking red flag", "I'm still friends with my high school sweetheart. We have lunch and dinner every now and then when we're in the same city. We share interests about art and food and music that our spouses don't share with us, so we talk now and again. He has a life and family and I have a life and family and they do not cross. Our respective spouses are OK with it because that's as far as it goes and as far as it will ever go. We no longer have any ties that can be construed as binding. Even so, I recognize that my situation is unusual and wouldn't be tolerated in a lot of relationships. I would not have anything \"ours\" with my ex to the exclusion of my husband, and I have an open marriage. Even an open relationship has to have a solid relationship at the core, and that relationship will have expectations and rules. In my case, the rules are that there is one relationship that wins in a contest - that is my marital relationship - and that we respect the rules in other people's relationships. It sounds like you are caught in between two primary relationships, and that never, ever works out.", "YTA", "Then be truthful with your girlfriend, you are not over your ex and you are hoping this vacation rekindles that. Stop lying to yourself about your intentions though.", "I think you and your ex should be able to have another conversation. Maybe being able to take partners of x months, so long as you\u2019re not there at the same time \n\nIt is great you are able to have such a harmonious relationship with your ex, but it is weird that absolutely no partners are allowed to your go to holiday home. I get it was a joint holiday home, but it remains a joint holiday home now you are separate\n\nIf you have issues allowing your ex to invite a new partner there, I suggest you think about your feelings and vis versa. You part own this place, as long as your ex isn\u2019t there enjoy the space. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to cut ties with him or his family to set new boundaries that respect any new relationship either of you find.", "You should not be in a relationship with someone else. If you feel this way this much, you are not ready.", "Probably, it might be your best chance at love", "That's a stretch.", "Lol I\u2019m happily married for 6 years.  Been together 12.  If you dumbass single people would stop being so self-involved, you might actually learn something."]}
