Just don\u2019t inform her it won\u2019t be brown if you do it at all.  Sometimes just letting people think they have won is half the battle.  Grandma will find another victim to harass until the wedding.  Just make sure you don\u2019t post any pictures that the family can see or photoshop your hair color so the ruse it complete.  Then show up wearing what you like looking the way you like.  If they don\u2019t like it you can get hang out at the hotel or house.  Uber/Lyft is a wonderful thing you can spend the day doing whatever you like at that point.", "NTA.  If it\u2019s that important to your aunt and grandma, they can buy you a wig.  Even then, it would up to you if you want to wear it.", "NTA\n\nParties are great, but do really want to go? If you can't go as yourself, is that a place worthy of going? \n\nBut if you do go, don't dye your hair if you don't want it. They can eat it.", "NTA.\n\nCompromise: Wig.", "NTA - I am 53 and have had multi coloured hair for the last 9 years (6 colours right now, with 17 being my record)\nEven if I was in someone\u2019s wedding party there is no way I would ever change my hair back to natural.", "Wear a wig. NTA", "Dye it bright bkue the day before", "NTA. This is disrespectful bullshit.", "NTA. They are being unreasonable. It\u2019s your body. If you were in the wedding party and would be in all the pictures etc. I might be a bit more sympathetic, but they can\u2019t control every aspect of what their guests will wear. And unless you come from an incredibly conservative family/town, most will not be shocked or honestly even notice a teenager with a slightly unusual hair colour. I hope your parents will do the right thing and defend you or at least give you the option not to attend.", "NTA - This is very uncool on their part.  \n\nEvery time I see a post where a bride or anyone in the vicinity of a bride tries to force someone to be who they aren't for \"The sake of the photos!\".  I think \"Oh that's a great family that just wants to erase your identity for the photo album\".   \n\nDon't burn your hair just to suit them. That's ridiculous.  (If you decide to change anything about it do it for YOU!).  \n\nAs for dressing more femme? What is up with Grandma even having a vote?  \nAn adult really needs to speak up on your behalf and get Grandma to keep her opinions to herself.   \n(Preferably whichever parent is related to her!).   \n\nMy own Dad used to pull this when we had Family events - he's say \"Oh you look really nice! I was just hoping we'd have 'our girl' today!\".  (Um I was 'their girl' regardless of how I was dressed at the time.).\nTo this day I have huge issues with compliments.  (Just ask my partner). \nOh, and I'm Non Binary.", "NTA if you are not in the wedding party and your parents are ok with it then your aunt is just being unreasonable because you are a guest. As for your gran, doesn't matter what she thinks because you need to be you at the end of the day.", "NTA. It\u2019s hair. They need to get over themselves. If your aunt and grandma don\u2019t like blue hair, that\u2019s cool, they can just make sure not to dye their hair blue.", "NTA - You shouldn't have to change your chair for just a party.", "You\u2019re a GUEST not the maid of honor ffs. If she wants you to be in attendance she can accept you as is. If you were in the bridal party I\u2019d understand her perspective a little more. \n\nIf you feel up to the compromise, maybe tell her you\u2019ll consider a wig in a natural color if it\u2019s something you both like. But I\u2019d have her pay for it since it\u2019s her demand. \n\nNTA. and your family is being unreasonable in their expectations.", "Your grandma and Aunt can suck it lol. Nta.", "NTA.  You are correct in that it would FRY your hair.   If they\u2019re so adamant about it, you could always tell them only if they pay.  AND they pay to a nice, expensive conditioning treatment of some sort.  You want the money up front.", "NTA. 100% your body, your choice in this situation. If you were in the wedding party, that comes with the expectation of catering to the bride's & groom's wishes. You're not. Neither your grandma, nor the bride (your aunt) have the right to dictate what you look like.", "NTA. \n\nI would ask your aunt, should you choose to not color your hair back to your natural shade, if she prefer you not come to the wedding. \n\nIf she says no, as I would expect, your all set. \nIf she says yes, then you know what\u2019s important to her. Skip it.", "NTA. It could be dyed neon green and they still wouldn\u2019t have the right or the moral standing to force you to change it.", "Since you parents agree with you, and they are your parents, they need to shut this down with Aunt and Grandma.  They need to tell them your hair stays and the subject needs to be dropped.", "NTA. Go as you are or don't go. If they care more about your hair color than your presence, that tells you EXACTLY how much you are actually valued and appreciated. You're a person, not an accessory to her wedding. Why go through all that trouble for someone who cares so little about you, your tastes, and your boundaries?", "They except you as you are or they can move along\n\nNta", "No is a complete sentence. Practice saying it. Be who you are and if it's a deal breaker for them, simply offer to not attend the wedding, but say that you will not be changing your hair color or anything else to make them happy. You are who you are and you are more than enough. You're fucking perfect. NTA", "NTA, your style and your style, and you are right, switching colours two times in a row would be waaaay too damaging to your hair. If your aunt continues to exist, would using a wig be an acceptable compromise? Or, since your hair is short, putting on a cute hat?", "NTA\n\nTell them you'll do it and then, right before the wedding, dye it a very bold color instead of brown. Or just buy the most obnoxious wig you can find and wear that. Maybe when you take it off they'll be relieved to see your normal dark blue lol.", "NTA\n\nTell them if they really don't like your blue hair, you could always shave it off the morning of the wedding, so that only \"natural\" is left, nothing blue. If you bleach out the blue, then dye it brown, it won't be natural, and it will be utterly fried by the intense treatments.  Probably rough, lots of split ends, and the color may not even \"take\" evenly.  It's not as straightforward as they imagine, and things can go wrong, making a major change in your hair at the last minute before the wedding.\n\nI'm also not sure that your aunt who is getting married actually cares, versus wanting to get her mother to stop nagging her about your hair.  If your grandmother is wanting to micro-manage the wedding down to your hair color, she's probably making her daughter who is getting married utterly miserable with all of her complaints and demands. \n\nPerhaps a wig with your \"natural\" hair color might soothe the nagging grandma, without forcing an actual change in your hair?", "NTA\n\nGood thing it\u2019s your hair and it theirs.  They don\u2019t have to like it and they certainly don\u2019t have the right to ask you to change it.", "NTA - your body and identity are not an aesthetic, and not theirs to control. Do what you want and they can deal with it like adults.", "NTA it's your hair they have no right to it. If they don't want you in pictures then you can sit out. If they don't want you to go then stay home", "Seems they don't really care about your boundaries, I've always been very rebellious since I was a little, so I will do it. The fact is that they will probably try to make you feel guilty about it anyway...", "I\u2019m a LOT older than you. Here are my thoughts:\n\nYou are a teenager. Your parents are on your side. Brides don\u2019t get to dictate the hair color of guests. People matter more than aesthetics.\n\nYou are NTA. You seem like a kind person. Don\u2019t lose that, but also keep being yourself. \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. Tell them you're keeping your hair the way it is or you're not going. Nobody has the right to demand other people change their appearance for a wedding. If having a picture perfect fairytale wedding is more important than celebrating with their loved ones, then they can ruin their relationships by not inviting the people who they don't think match their idea of what's proper.", "A wig could be a fun compromise", "NTA.  Your parents are with you. Do not dye your hair. No wig,  no hat, no nothing.  Depending on how old you are (under 18), your parents should be running interference for you. If you're 18 or more, tell Granny the discussion is over and do not engage. Same with your aunt. If your aunt doesn't agree, then don't go.", "NTA, find out if she even wants you there. Frankly, if you're not in the wedding party, walking down the aisle, then why does it matter?? \n\nMaybe see if you can skip it entirely. I understand having your personality erased by family. It sucks. Fight for yourself, peacefully as possible, and remember who wouldn't accept you when you're past 18.", "NTA, be like this weird, awesome old lady.", "Honestly I don\u2019t mind if she doesn\u2019t want me in the wedding, it\u2019s the fact she\u2019s trying to control how I look when I\u2019m not in it that makes me mad.", "Loll that\u2019s what my mom is joking about", "I\u2019m with my grandma a lot more than my aunt, and as for my dad who\u2019s related to her, he cut her off. Honestly I don\u2019t blame him, she\u2019s so damn annoying and bigoted sometimes. My aunt is a momma\u2019s girl, so that\u2019s why they\u2019re teaming together.", "That\u2019s exactly my mom\u2019s point, she said herself that if my aunt continues to push that she can pay for me to get a wig if it matters that much.", "I mean, I think the aunt is going to continue to exist. But either way, NTA.", "No, my aunt has told me straight up she wants my hair natural, and that we would talk more about it at Christmas. I feel like she cares a bit *less* but she still isn\u2019t gonna let it go very easily.", "Oh trust me they do, and my grandma doesn\u2019t give two shits about any of my boundaries. And yes, they have both already tried the guilt.", "I agree 100%. If your not in the wedding, auntie has no dog in the fight. Grandma just wants a little girl with pigtails and a dress. You be YOU.", "That seems like my best option lol", "A wig that doesn't look like a wig is expensive.  You get any other kind and people will talk. \"Oo, do you think she has cancer? \" if your aunt thinks blue hair will pull attention,  wait for THAT to get around. Or it'll get hot and itchy. Or it'll slip. Go as yourself. You won't regret it.", "NTA. Maybe your mom and others who think grandma and auntie are excessively concerned about personal details that have nothing to do with them would join you and get a blue rinse (or pink, orange, green) for the day.", "I would lol", "I\u2019m glad most of the people in your family are at least on your side. That definitely makes it easier to stand your ground.\n\nAlthough, personally, if she kept pushing it I\u2019d probably show up in a neon blue wig instead just to be petty. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Seriously?? NTA. It's your hair! It isn't up for public discussion. Auntie and grandma have absolutely no say over your body.", "I am so sorry you are in this situation, please hold on, one day you will be free from their judgments \ud83d\udc9a", "Don\u2019t give me ideas \ud83e\udd2d", "\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\n\n\u2026Have you considered fluorescent pink?", "NTA it really isn\u2019t about the wedding. They\u2019re using that as an excuse to force you to change something they\u2019ve always hated.  If it wasn\u2019t the wedding it would be some other thing, eventually.", "NTA. Your body, your choice.", "You\u2019re just a guest? They can all shut up. I was going to suggest the temporary colours that go on like hairspray and just wash out immediately if you wanted to bother with indulging. But you\u2019re not in the wedding party even! Keep the blue. People are ridiculous.\nEdit: tell her what it will cost, either doing it in a salon , or buying box dye, get the money from her. Pocket it, use the hairspray style colour \ud83d\ude08", "You're NTA. Personally if I was you I either wouldn't attend or would attend with the dyed hair. \n\nA good compromise if you're looking to calm your aunt and grandma would be to wear a wig to the wedding. You can definitely find a natural coloured wig for cheap, although it will definitely look cheap and fake - a good way around this is to sprinkle baby powder or to spray dry shampoo to get rid of that fake wig shine.", "NTA. You are a guest. Are they asking other guests to change their looks?  They can always decide not to invite you, but if they want you there, they need to let you be you.", "NTA- go with the wig- saves everyone from being AH\u2019s", "NTA. You are not a prop for her pretty princess day. If she wants to invite **you-the-person**, she gets you-the-person.", "What is a wedding, if not a celebration of two people coming together because they have chosen to love each other for who they are? Wouldn't it be great if that could extend from the happy couple outwards to everyone?\n\nTell Grandma, love me for who I am, not who you wish I were.", "NTA. Do you have roots? You say it's short. If you want you can pull a big 'fuck you' and just shave it down to stubble. All natural! If 'femininity' is their goal, then they'r not going to be happy with that. But what're they going to do? Ask you to grow your hair faster? They ask for a wig? What, they want hide your all natural hair? What if you were a cancer survivor? This is ripe for malicious compliance.", "NTA... You're a guest, not even part of the wedding.\n\nIf you were my child, I'd be having a conversation with Auntie and/or grandma, and if they didn't back off we'd probably be going on a different outing on her wedding day.\n\nGlad your family is supportive.", "NTA. Tell your grandma that if you did get your natural colour back, it\u2019d damage your hair so much you\u2019d have to shave it off after a week or so when it started breaking off in clumps. Watch her change her mind in a hurry!", "NTA. Hair is personal.  Vivid colours are commonplace nowadays.", "NTA.  I'm NAF of unusual hair colors but what someone chooses to do with their hair is their business, not mine.  It's not grandma's or aunt's business what you do with your hair.  Even if you could go back to your natural color without frying your hair, you shouldn't.  If you like, take up aunt's offer to buy you a wig.  Or, complete the wedding theme by dyeing half your hair burgundy.", "Your grandma and your aunt don't have veto power over your hair. I would tell my aunt I'll be happy to skip her wedding to go hang out with non-assholes.", "NTA. You're not even part of the wedding so they definitely have no right to tell you what colour hair you should/can have.", "NTA. Try \"I come as I am or not at all!\" and see what happens. Of course, this will only work if you are happy to not go.\n\nYou could also ask who else's hair they are policing or if they have chosen you specially.", "NTA. I'm 68, and if you were my grandchild, I'd be so proud of you for being your authentic self. And I'd probably get a temporary color rinse and dye my hair blue in solidarity!", "NTA Ignore the aunt.\n\n Try: \"Grandma, I love you. I love you so much that I spend most of my time with you. I love that you pay attention to everyone around you, I love that you are feisty,  I love your sense of humor, and your sense of family. I thought you felt the same about me. But now you are saying that what you love about me, is how a single side of me reflects on who you are. And if I don't reflect that, then maybe you don't love me the way I love you. It is just hair, Grandma. You say \"oh it will grow back\" I say \"It is just hair, get over it\". But if you want ME at the wedding, then my hair goes with me. If you just want a pretty toy at the wedding, do I even need to be there?\"", "Get a wig. Super cheap, quick solution.", "Nope. Don't change who you are. You're a guest, as long as you're dressed appropriately for the event, then you do you. \n\nAnd just so you know, I'm from your grandmother's generation. I may be nitpicky about my own appearance  (I have had purple hair for years), but I would never tell any of the younger generations in my family how to dress or behave - I love how the clothes they chose, the colours they wear, etc, reflect their personalities and their individuality. Wear your blue hair with confidence - unless you're tired of blue, then I suggest you try purple for a change \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA. Your aunt can\u2019t force people to change their appearance. Could you perhaps wear a dark brown kind of thick dark headband like a gaiter to cover part of it?", "NTA. Don\u2019t let them strong arm you on this. Hold your ground, kiddo. As far as social etiquette goes, they are in the wrong here. It\u2019s completely uncouth to dictate how a young lady wears her hair.", "Maybe it's an age thing, but my youngest brother got a laugh out of my hair (and dress) matching his wedding colors. Admittedly it was more of a cartoon blue than I planned, but still. \n\nIf anything, OP having her natural color might draw more attention then the blue hair, especially if family and friends know her with the blue color.", "I'm with you. I don't understand thinking you get to treat your wedding party like dolls, honestly. You're asking people you care about to be part of an event symbolizing starting a new chapter of your life. That doesn't mean they lose their bodily autonomy. You're not then entitled to change their appearance like they're set dressing. This obsession with the aesthetics of a wedding day is goofy and weird, to me. Like, do all you want to make it your day to but asking people to change their hair color or length, cover tattoos, lose weight, or otherwise change themselves to fit your dream is just disgusting behavior, in my opinion.", "I know you said 6 not 5, but reading your comment straight away made me think of McFly - 5 Colours In Her Hair haha.", "so your mom agrees with you, and your dad won\u2019t even entertain the person asking (demanding) because she\u2019s such an awful person. i don\u2019t understand why this is even a question.", "Tell her there's nothing to talk about. Your answer is no. \n\nThe only person whose hair colour she gets to dictate is her own. \n\nShe should have far more interesting things to think about whilst planning her wedding than one teenagers hair colour. No offense, blue sounds awesome lol, she just sounds like an ass.", "Somebody else said it best. You are not a doll to dress up.", "I would get some hair chalk or color wax and put multicolored stripes in my hair.", "Pink is for girls! Grandma wants OP to be feminine! Win-win!", "Something multicolored, perhaps.", "I\u2019ve been dyeing my hair for years, and just last week went from blue to a split black/pink colour.   \nBlue is the hardest colour to get out of your hair, it fades fast too but the colour left behind is really difficult to get rid of. So it needs a lot of bleach, and then putting a brown tone over the top will need a permanent colour with base tones of red. There isn\u2019t really a wash out brown that would work for this, so you would be risking damaging your hair and would have to grow it out before you could bleach and colour it again.\n\nLuckily it seems like most of your relatives are on your side, so I wouldn\u2019t feel bad for not being willing to dye your hair brown for a wedding.   \nAnd yeah, there is always the option of a wig instead if it really matters that much to your aunt. But she should be the one to pay for it!", "Tell her since your hair is obviously such an issue you think it would be best that you don't attend so as not to let your hair colour impact her special day.", "I\u2019m getting married in two weeks. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s niece dyed her hair a deep purple and asked us if we want her to dye them back to normal. We both said absolutely not! It looks awesome on her but even if I didn\u2019t like it I wouldn\u2019t ask that of her. I invite the person and not a prop.", "If I was a more uptight person than I am, I could see being annoying I'd someone in my wedding party dyed their hair a bright color after committing to be in the wedding party but before the wedding, without givinge a heads up.\n\nDark blue is not bright or that visually distracting. And you are simply a guest. So definitely NTA. And I feel you... My hair is dyed dark brown and is super fine. Bleaching would destroy it, and be expensive. It's not reasonable to dictate guests hair color for a wedding.", "Make sure it is a cheap wig and looks ridiculous!", "And saying, truthfully and honestly,  \"the bride made me dye it\" would be infinitely more mortifying than having a guest with blue hair. Or at least *should* be.", "It's not going to be natural no matter what. It's going to be dyed.\n\nI say go ahead and dye your hair, as long as the bride makes it clear everyone else with dyed hair has to restore their hair to their natural hair color. All bottle blondes or women who touch up the gray? Back to their natural color."]}
