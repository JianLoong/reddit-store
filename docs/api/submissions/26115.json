She\u2019s only 23, and things have been really hard. Immunotherapy and targeted chemo have helped quite a bit. I love her a lot, and can not stress enough how much she means to me. It has been her dream to go to Europe, so we went together to knock it off her bucket list. Just me and her.\n\nOn the last day of the trip while we both had too much alcohol, she told me that she was in love with me. I told her it wasn\u2019t possible, but she said it was true.\n\nFor clarification, I am in a relationship with a man. We\u2019re all bi, including Danny. I met him in highschool and we\u2019ve been together for 7 years at this point. He is absolutely the love of my life, and the person I want to spend my life with. Danny knows this. She loves him too. \n\nBack to Danny, she said she really needed to know before she dies if I\u2019ve ever felt that way about her, if I ever thought about it.\n\nIf I\u2019m honest, I hadn\u2019t. I know it\u2019s normal for most queer people to have crushes on many different people, especially in HS, but I met my bf so young I didn\u2019t really get to experience much of that. I met him, and afterwards I was only into him.\n\nStill she sounded so desperate for me to validate her feelings so I said, \u201cYou know what, if I was straight or had never met my boyfriend, I can see it. You\u2019d be the only woman for me.\u201d It made sense to say, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a lie. We are best friends and share everything. Maybe it could be true. It\u2019s hard to know because I\u2019m so in love with my bf but the answer satisfied her and that satisfied me. \n\nShe ended up asking me to kiss her after, and that\u2019s when I knew things had gone too far. I said I would never cheat on my bf, I\u2019d rather cut off my arm. She said she needs this before she dies, a kiss isn\u2019t a big deal and I said no, absolutely not. I said I would do anything for her but not this.\n\nThe next morning she apologized like crazy, and I said it was fine, but I\u2019ve felt sick about the conversation since it happened. I feel a ton of guilt. I feel like I did wrong by my bf because I know he would not be happy about that conversation. He put a lot of trust with me, being totally fine with me going on trips alone with people and I feel like I spit in his face. He is a really jealous person, he would not be OK with me not telling him about this.\n\nTo make it more complicated, he\u2019s also paying all her medical bills and is the reason she\u2019s getting top-quality medical care. She lives with us, and he pays for everything because he loves me and he sees her like family. His family has money and ours don\u2019t so his support has meant everything. It didn\u2019t even occur to me to tell him because I know it would cause unnecessary drama, and she doesn\u2019t have much time left. I don\u2019t want her last moments with her only family, us, to be tainted. \n\nAITA? Was that conversation inappropriate? I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m making a bigger deal out of it. But I am filled with guilt and feel sick to my stomach.", "created_utc": 1693725854, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168qhbw/aita_for_declining_her_dying_wish_and_not_telling/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your answer has so much grace - and a little white lie to comfort her is more than okay. Had she not been dying, this could have been a slippery slope. But all your intentions are pure, so pure. That being very evident for the immediate and hard boundary you set when she tried to push for more in wanting a kiss.\n\nDon't tell your boyfriend, it will only hurt him and doesn't serve a purpose. From the sounds of it, it's eating you up and I get that: I would hate to keep this to myself and I would want to tell my partner so badly. But truth for the sakeness of the truth itself will in this case be self-serving as it would be for you to feel the relief, but it will only hurt two people you clearly love so much. Nothing happened, you were comforting a dying friend - you don't have romantic feelings for this person, so there is really nothing to disclose as nothing that was said in that conversation has an impact on how you feel about your bf or your relationship.\n\nAnd Danny clearly regrets letting the alcohol getting to her and suppress her filter and \u00dcber-Ich (super-ego that regulates your responses to fit with norms and morals). She has clearly been able to suppress expressing these feelings up until now because she knows it's not fair to put them out there, so her regretting seems very heartfelt and genuine.\n\nYou have grace, keep that up.", "NTA. All these are fleeting feelings, sometimes augmented  by alcohol. Don\u2019t look too much into it.", "NTA.  Nothing happened and it was just a conversation.  Nothing in your relationship changed with either your bf or your friend.  Let it go.", "Honestly, Danny ITAH. It sucks that her time is short, but emotional blackmail is so wrong. She was out of line with her questions and her request to kiss. It shows zero respect for you or your boyfriend \nIf I am to be honest...it was an awkward conversation you had with her. You told a white lie to someone who is terminal. I don't think you need to feel bad and I don't think your bf ever has to hear about it.", "NAH, and you have NOTHING to be guilty about.\n\nShe has feelings for you, and you shut her down in the kindest possible way. It's not your fault and you've done nothing wrong that she has feelings for you, and given the time limits that she will be with you, my personal opinion is that your 'avoidance' of drama by not telling your boyfriend is absolutely the right thing to do just now. Again YOU have done nothing wrong.\n\nIf you are somehow feeling that you need \"punishment\" for what's happened, then I disagree. If I did agree (which I don't) I think the burden of carrying all this is well over and above the boundary of any punishment requirement (especially since that's zero anyway).\n\nPlease may I also advise: do NOT make any big decisions about your relationship in the next year or so as you adjust to the loss of your friend. Your boyfriend sounds like the jealous type, you're both under stress at the moment so your \"sick\" reaction could be due to that. If you're normally that scared of him finding out about innocent conversations or twisting stuff around then that's something you may need to address with him at some point, although for now, sounds like the focus needs to be on ensuring your friend and 'chosen family' is comfortable. Sorry for your impending loss.", "NTA, imho you\u2019ve got nothing to feel guilty or bad about. I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to your bff.", "No a holes here. She is desperate for connections before she leaves this life. Desperation causes things to happen and be said. She profusely apologized the next day. You might have a bigger problem then you think with your s/o though. Her thoughts are deep seeded but life brought them forward. She loves you both no the less.", "She probably doesn't see you as a true life partner.. but just like the trip away, she has a passionate love story on her bucket list and tried to use you to at least fantasise it. Treat it as just a symptom of her illness, it need not ruin anything", "NTA\n\nWhen faced with terminal illness, its perfectly understandable that people want to have closure. However, it also means that the prospect of knowing when they are dying, can make some people overstep boundaries. I think this is may be what happened here. However, you kept your loyalties intact, nothing happened, she apologised....just try and move on from this. The saying \"Least said, Soonest mended\" comes to mind.", "Leave it as is. You declined that kiss, but lying to her led to that. She apologized but you made the lie. So that was a bit of an assholish move to get out of this situation.\n\nPlease note for any situation that puts you in difficulty, give up on what is asked and lie does not lead to any form of better situation. If you are tempted to do so, keep that very example in mind and do not think that pleasing someone this way leads them to give up.\n\nNo need to escalate anything more. You haven't kissed her, full stop. Reporting a drunk convo that slipped out of hand is imo pointless. And you should give up on the guilt toward bf. You did lie, but to your bff. Promise yourself that you happen to have done that in the most awkward situation ever : while traveling + drunk night (pretty classic imo) but the unusual part is that it was toward dying bff... Not even a good looking stranger or even dying stranger, just someone you actually love but not that way...\nSo forgive yourself. \n\nNow about what you describe with bf, being full of money and of jealous type does not sound that good, with this out of control guilt in the stomach from you, it really sounds tricky. I hope you do not have too much of age difference and that he is not a manipulative violent AH or that you are not part of some some cult in a desert area... But that is another story. \n\nGood luck with what is going to happen next, losing your bff and moving on with your life.", "I fail to see What in that conversation was wrong on your part? NTA", "Between chemo and any other meds and drinking on top of knowing she's dying I can say her emotions are all over the place inside ..someone who knows they are on limited time they don't always think straight or maybe she just yearns for any love you are a safe bet she already loves and trust you. And when people are dying or sick your mind wonders alot and you think what if and never knowing is scary. I wouldn't let it upset you to much because you didn't cheat. It seems she has a lot going on with not much time and drinking taps into those emotions.. she a least apologized I don't think it's anything to cause tension over.  Id leave it where it lies and jus be thankful you're loved so hard. That's raw. She's lucky to have you both. The conversation ended no one was hurt and to tell him will cause pain soen things are better left unsaid it sucks to say..she don't need stress and he don't need a reason to push her away.  Maybe she was wanting affection from you who she trust as a way to feel more alive   or beautiful any emotion. Don't let this turn you away she did what alot of people wouldn't even if it's not true she confided in you something that can only go two ways.  I can assure you she won't do it again.", "YTA, these comments are crazy. Dying doesn\u2019t give someone a free pass to try and cheat on the very person who is helping them the most in their time of need. Boyfriend steps up & lets her live with the 2 of you while paying her medical expenses & more. She decides the best way to help us to confess her love to you & try to convince you to cheat. \n\nIf I was in the boyfriends shoes & I found later I\u2019d be getting dumping both of you. The friend for the betrayal & you for the deciding that I didn\u2019t deserve the truth.", "NTA\n\nThe wish of kissing you might be understandable but is still out of line. You are in a relationship, end of discussion.\n\nRegarding the part of not telling your partner. You were comforting your friend with a hypothecial scenario with very big \"ifs\", so I don't see it as wrong saysing what you said. I however see it as a sad thing, that you are scared to tell your boyfriend. I won't say it's bad to not tell him but in my opinion it's bad that you seemingly can't tell him.", "[removed]", "I would be honest about the whole situation with your partner. Communication is a big factor in a relationship. Even tho I don't think she is actual in love with you and more looking for some sort of connection to someone special.

If they really aren't going to survive, it's understandable that this meant something different to them than to you. \n\nI think calling kissing you her \"dying wish\" is melodramatic, but I see why it's a difficult one to work through.", "I would tell your boyfriend maybe a toned down version.

You have nothing to confess to your bf, and there's no reason he needs to know the details of a conversation which went nowhere. You are NTA. PS your description of his extreme jealousy is a bit concerning generally.", "NAH. First off I am sorry you're going through this. Being the person supporting a terminal cancer patient is extremely hard. I've done it myself but there are a few things I hope I can offer that might help based off my experience. \n\nDanny is dying and (I'm assuming) not in a relationship. There is a lot going on there emotionally and it was probably super comforting to hear that this person she loves could see himself loving her back romantically. I read this as her seeking validation that yes, she knows someone out there could envision a life with her. It would never have happened but that's ok. It's a lovely daydream. It's not even 100% she is as deeply in love as she thinks but more will never have the chance to find THE ONE or has become dependent on you and she feels it's love (this happens a lot when people mistake intimate friendship for romantic feelings). In all likelihood, if she was well this conversation would never have happened and she would have moved on. She won't have that chance so confessing is all she can do. Either way your response was perfect and her doing something awkward is excusable, she is coming to grips with the fact this disease is going to steal a lot from her.  \n\nFor your boyfriend, if it's safe to tell him (the he's very jealous part is a bit concerning) wait until after she has passed. Frame it as granting a dying woman a bit of hope and that she did apologize for it. Nothing romantic ever happened between the two of you and even your answer to Danny made it clear your relationship came first. If he reacts badly be clear this was a desperate validation for a dying woman that gave her a little bit of happiness and she even apologized for any awkward feelings afterwards. Also make it clear you wanted to confide right away but knew her time was limited and that there would be no benefit to making everything awkward in her remaining time. He might take some time to be upset but telling her no, you never could have ever loved her seems cruel. She got a very short period with the comforting knowledge you \"could have loved her\" and the two of you get a lifetime of actual love. \n\nI really hope this helps. Try not to feel guilty about this. You did the kindest thing possible, you were not at all unfaithful and truly there would be no benefit to decimating your/her family support system right now. You're all dealing with truma and grief, there is not need to compound it. \n\nStay strong you are a wonderful person and you can navigate these waters.  There will be time  to sort out the details later, right now take every minute you have with your friend and try to arrange for some grief counselling session for later. I wish you the very best \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA yikes\n\nETA Danny is being manipulative and gross. You\u2019re SO deserves better truly. He\u2019s paying for al of her stuff and her bills for her to pull this on you? absolutely not. last moments or not nothing she did is okay", "If you do not tell your partner then yes YTA absolutely 1000%. I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s dying or not she was ABSOLUTELY out of line and so were you with saying you would have been with her. \n\nHow dare your \u201cfriend\u201d do that?! She is real ballsy to do that when your partner is PAYING FOR HER CARE AND LETTING HER LIVE WITH YOU. You need to tell him. If he cuts off funds for her care then oh fucking well, those are the consequences to her actions and she absolutely deserves it. It\u2019s so wrong to hide this from your partner so he pays for the care of a woman that made moves on his partner knowing HE is the one footing bill for her care. If he stops paying for anything and kicks her out, it serves her right. Her family or some other schmuck can pay. Kinda hope he dumps you too for playing along, that was disrespectful af to your relationship", "OP, you're playing a dangerous game with your future. You're so worried about your friend that you're not thinking enough about your relationship.  Of course, morally you know you should tell your partner when someone in your lives asked you to cheat on them.  \n\nBut practically, what happens if your friend decides she wants you to herself in her last few days, gets drunk, and tells your partner that you confessed feelings for her? What if she lies and says you two were intimate that night? \n\nI know all your thoughts are about protecting your friend, but you need to consider what lying (by onission) will do to your relationship. Your partner deserves the truth.", "NTA\n\nThe conversation was inappropriate in that Danny put you into an impossible position. I know it's uncomfortable to speak ill of those in Danny's situation, but the fact of the matter is she was being very unfair and selfish. At worst you told a white lie. Otherwise you did nothing wrong.", "She was drunk and she's realizing that she'll never have the chance to experience most of the life events that the rest of us take for granted. She must be terrified. I'd cut her some slack.", "I agree. I think she\u2019s desperate to be in love since she hasn\u2019t experienced that before. I don\u2019t think she really loves me, in that way, it was just the alcohol and stress from the situation talking, and she did apologize for it all.\n\n>You might have a bigger problem then you think with your s/o though.\n\nWhat do you mean by this? \n\nThank you for the comment, by the way. I appreciate it.", "I really appreciate the kind words and the advice, thank you. I\u2019ll keep that in mind. It didn\u2019t feel like a lie in the moment, but looking back it was one. It led to her thinking I had some sort of romantic feelings for her, which isn\u2019t really true.\n\nBut my boyfriend isn\u2019t violent or an asshole or any of that. Also no cults, haha. We are the same age. We have a really good relationship but he\u2019s also young and a bit hot headed. If I did tell him, he would be very upset with her for hitting on me and probably be upset with me for not telling him sooner and that wouldn\u2019t be great for anyone involved. I would understand him feeling upset/betrayed in normal circumstances but this is a unique situation. I don\u2019t think she would have said what she said if she wasn\u2019t stressed out from the cancer and terrified about the future so I think she deserves a pass because things have been really horrible. But he wouldn\u2019t really see it that way. But yes, no reason to escalate things and better to pretend the whole thing didn\u2019t happen. Thank you again.", "Great. The toxic straight people showed up. Go away", "Not sure what the other commenter was referring to, but I\u2019m not chill with how jealous you say your boyfriend would get. Has he been jealous of Danny before? If so, has he said why? Have you and Danny done \u201ccouple-y\u201d things before? I think jealously is a red flag, but that\u2019s just me and I am not in your relationship, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind. You said you don\u2019t currently have or have ever had any feelings for Danny so what is there for him to be jealous of?", "I'm a toxic straight person, Please don't lump us in with them.", "I usually think his jealousy is cute. It\u2019s totally fair that it would be a red flag for you, but it isn\u2019t that big of a deal for me. We all have our flaws and all that. I called him a jealous person because he is, but it\u2019s not in an overbearing way. I worked as a bartender for awhile and he was not happy about people hitting on me, but it wasn\u2019t that serious. He just gets a little jealous\n\nBut no, he\u2019s not jealous of Danny in the slightest. He has his own best friend that he would move mountains for, so he gets it. Like I said, he is totally fine with us spending time alone together, going on vacations alone, etc because he gets we are best friends and he trusts me. Danny and I have always had a very\u2026 sibling relationship. I feel uncomfortable admitting that after she confessed what she did, but it\u2019s true."]}
