She\u2019s only 23, and things have been really hard. Immunotherapy and targeted chemo have helped quite a bit. I love her a lot, and can not stress enough how much she means to me. It has been her dream to go to Europe, so we went together to knock it off her bucket list. Just me and her.\n\nOn the last day of the trip while we both had too much alcohol, she told me that she was in love with me. I told her it wasn\u2019t possible, but she said it was true.\n\nFor clarification, I am in a relationship with a man. We\u2019re all bi, including Danny. I met him in highschool and we\u2019ve been together for 7 years at this point. He is absolutely the love of my life, and the person I want to spend my life with. Danny knows this. She loves him too. \n\nBack to Danny, she said she really needed to know before she dies if I\u2019ve ever felt that way about her, if I ever thought about it.\n\nIf I\u2019m honest, I hadn\u2019t. I know it\u2019s normal for most queer people to have crushes on many different people, especially in HS, but I met my bf so young I didn\u2019t really get to experience much of that. I met him, and afterwards I was only into him.\n\nStill she sounded so desperate for me to validate her feelings so I said, \u201cYou know what, if I was straight or had never met my boyfriend, I can see it. You\u2019d be the only woman for me.\u201d It made sense to say, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a lie. We are best friends and share everything. Maybe it could be true. It\u2019s hard to know because I\u2019m so in love with my bf but the answer satisfied her and that satisfied me. \n\nShe ended up asking me to kiss her after, and that\u2019s when I knew things had gone too far. I said I would never cheat on my bf, I\u2019d rather cut off my arm. She said she needs this before she dies, a kiss isn\u2019t a big deal and I said no, absolutely not. I said I would do anything for her but not this.\n\nThe next morning she apologized like crazy, and I said it was fine, but I\u2019ve felt sick about the conversation since it happened. I feel a ton of guilt. I feel like I did wrong by my bf because I know he would not be happy about that conversation. He put a lot of trust with me, being totally fine with me going on trips alone with people and I feel like I spit in his face. He is a really jealous person, he would not be OK with me not telling him about this.\n\nTo make it more complicated, he\u2019s also paying all her medical bills and is the reason she\u2019s getting top-quality medical care. She lives with us, and he pays for everything because he loves me and he sees her like family. His family has money and ours don\u2019t so his support has meant everything. It didn\u2019t even occur to me to tell him because I know it would cause unnecessary drama, and she doesn\u2019t have much time left. I don\u2019t want her last moments with her only family, us, to be tainted. \n\nAITA? Was that conversation inappropriate? I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m making a bigger deal out of it. But I am filled with guilt and feel sick to my stomach.", "created_utc": 1693725854, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168qhbw/aita_for_declining_her_dying_wish_and_not_telling/", "score": 250, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your answer has so much grace - and a little white lie to comfort her is more than okay. Had she not been dying, this could have been a slippery slope. But all your intentions are pure, so pure. That being very evident for the immediate and hard boundary you set when she tried to push for more in wanting a kiss.\n\nDon't tell your boyfriend, it will only hurt him and doesn't serve a purpose. From the sounds of it, it's eating you up and I get that: I would hate to keep this to myself and I would want to tell my partner so badly. But truth for the sakeness of the truth itself will in this case be self-serving as it would be for you to feel the relief, but it will only hurt two people you clearly love so much. Nothing happened, you were comforting a dying friend - you don't have romantic feelings for this person, so there is really nothing to disclose as nothing that was said in that conversation has an impact on how you feel about your bf or your relationship.\n\nAnd Danny clearly regrets letting the alcohol getting to her and suppress her filter and \u00dcber-Ich (super-ego that regulates your responses to fit with norms and morals). She has clearly been able to suppress expressing these feelings up until now because she knows it's not fair to put them out there, so her regretting seems very heartfelt and genuine.\n\nYou have grace, keep that up.", "NTA. All these are fleeting feelings, sometimes augmented  by alcohol. Don\u2019t look too much into it.", "NTA.  Nothing happened and it was just a conversation.  Nothing in your relationship changed with either your bf or your friend.  Let it go.", "Honestly, Danny ITAH. It sucks that her time is short, but emotional blackmail is so wrong. She was out of line with her questions and her request to kiss. It shows zero respect for you or your boyfriend \nIf I am to be honest...it was an awkward conversation you had with her. You told a white lie to someone who is terminal. I don't think you need to feel bad and I don't think your bf ever has to hear about it.", "NAH, and you have NOTHING to be guilty about.\n\nShe has feelings for you, and you shut her down in the kindest possible way. It's not your fault and you've done nothing wrong that she has feelings for you, and given the time limits that she will be with you, my personal opinion is that your 'avoidance' of drama by not telling your boyfriend is absolutely the right thing to do just now. Again YOU have done nothing wrong.\n\nIf you are somehow feeling that you need \"punishment\" for what's happened, then I disagree. If I did agree (which I don't) I think the burden of carrying all this is well over and above the boundary of any punishment requirement (especially since that's zero anyway).\n\nPlease may I also advise: do NOT make any big decisions about your relationship in the next year or so as you adjust to the loss of your friend. Your boyfriend sounds like the jealous type, you're both under stress at the moment so your \"sick\" reaction could be due to that. If you're normally that scared of him finding out about innocent conversations or twisting stuff around then that's something you may need to address with him at some point, although for now, sounds like the focus needs to be on ensuring your friend and 'chosen family' is comfortable. Sorry for your impending loss.", "NTA, imho you\u2019ve got nothing to feel guilty or bad about. I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to your bff.", "No a holes here. She is desperate for connections before she leaves this life. Desperation causes things to happen and be said. She profusely apologized the next day. You might have a bigger problem then you think with your s/o though. Her thoughts are deep seeded but life brought them forward. She loves you both no the less.", "She probably doesn't see you as a true life partner.. but just like the trip away, she has a passionate love story on her bucket list and tried to use you to at least fantasise it. Treat it as just a symptom of her illness, it need not ruin anything", "NTA\n\nWhen faced with terminal illness, its perfectly understandable that people want to have closure. However, it also means that the prospect of knowing when they are dying, can make some people overstep boundaries. I think this is may be what happened here. However, you kept your loyalties intact, nothing happened, she apologised....just try and move on from this. The saying \"Least said, Soonest mended\" comes to mind.", "Leave it as is. You declined that kiss, but lying to her led to that. She apologized but you made the lie. So that was a bit of an assholish move to get out of this situation.\n\nPlease note for any situation that puts you in difficulty, give up on what is asked and lie does not lead to any form of better situation. If you are tempted to do so, keep that very example in mind and do not think that pleasing someone this way leads them to give up.\n\nNo need to escalate anything more. You haven't kissed her, full stop. Reporting a drunk convo that slipped out of hand is imo pointless. And you should give up on the guilt toward bf. You did lie, but to your bff. Promise yourself that you happen to have done that in the most awkward situation ever : while traveling + drunk night (pretty classic imo) but the unusual part is that it was toward dying bff... Not even a good looking stranger or even dying stranger, just someone you actually love but not that way...\nSo forgive yourself. \n\nNow about what you describe with bf, being full of money and of jealous type does not sound that good, with this out of control guilt in the stomach from you, it really sounds tricky. I hope you do not have too much of age difference and that he is not a manipulative violent AH or that you are not part of some some cult in a desert area... But that is another story. \n\nGood luck with what is going to happen next, losing your bff and moving on with your life.", "I fail to see What in that conversation was wrong on your part? NTA", "Between chemo and any other meds and drinking on top of knowing she's dying I can say her emotions are all over the place inside ..someone who knows they are on limited time they don't always think straight or maybe she just yearns for any love you are a safe bet she already loves and trust you. And when people are dying or sick your mind wonders alot and you think what if and never knowing is scary. I wouldn't let it upset you to much because you didn't cheat. It seems she has a lot going on with not much time and drinking taps into those emotions.. she a least apologized I don't think it's anything to cause tension over.  Id leave it where it lies and jus be thankful you're loved so hard. That's raw. She's lucky to have you both. The conversation ended no one was hurt and to tell him will cause pain soen things are better left unsaid it sucks to say..she don't need stress and he don't need a reason to push her away.  Maybe she was wanting affection from you who she trust as a way to feel more alive   or beautiful any emotion. Don't let this turn you away she did what alot of people wouldn't even if it's not true she confided in you something that can only go two ways.  I can assure you she won't do it again.", "YTA, these comments are crazy. Dying doesn\u2019t give someone a free pass to try and cheat on the very person who is helping them the most in their time of need. Boyfriend steps up & lets her live with the 2 of you while paying her medical expenses & more. She decides the best way to help us to confess her love to you & try to convince you to cheat. \n\nIf I was in the boyfriends shoes & I found later I\u2019d be getting dumping both of you. The friend for the betrayal & you for the deciding that I didn\u2019t deserve the truth.", "NTA\n\nThe wish of kissing you might be understandable but is still out of line. You are in a relationship, end of discussion.\n\nRegarding the part of not telling your partner. You were comforting your friend with a hypothecial scenario with very big \"ifs\", so I don't see it as wrong saysing what you said. I however see it as a sad thing, that you are scared to tell your boyfriend. I won't say it's bad to not tell him but in my opinion it's bad that you seemingly can't tell him.", "[removed]", "I would be honest about the whole situation with your partner.

If they really aren't going to survive, it's understandable that this meant something different to them than to you. \n\nI think calling kissing you her \"dying wish\" is melodramatic, but I see why it's a difficult one to work through.", "I would tell your boyfriend maybe a toned down version.

You have nothing to confess to your bf, and there's no reason he needs to know the details of a conversation which went nowhere. You are NTA. PS your description of his extreme jealousy is a bit concerning generally.", "NAH. First off I am sorry you're going through this. Being the person supporting a terminal cancer patient is extremely hard. I've done it myself but there are a few things I hope I can offer that might help based off my experience. \n\nDanny is dying and (I'm assuming) not in a relationship. There is a lot going on there emotionally and it was probably super comforting to hear that this person she loves could see himself loving her back romantically. I read this as her seeking validation that yes, she knows someone out there could envision a life with her. It would never have happened but that's ok. It's a lovely daydream. It's not even 100% she is as deeply in love as she thinks but more will never have the chance to find THE ONE or has become dependent on you and she feels it's love (this happens a lot when people mistake intimate friendship for romantic feelings). In all likelihood, if she was well this conversation would never have happened and she would have moved on. She won't have that chance so confessing is all she can do. Either way your response was perfect and her doing something awkward is excusable, she is coming to grips with the fact this disease is going to steal a lot from her.  \n\nFor your boyfriend, if it's safe to tell him (the he's very jealous part is a bit concerning) wait until after she has passed. Frame it as granting a dying woman a bit of hope and that she did apologize for it. Nothing romantic ever happened between the two of you and even your answer to Danny made it clear your relationship came first. If he reacts badly be clear this was a desperate validation for a dying woman that gave her a little bit of happiness and she even apologized for any awkward feelings afterwards. Also make it clear you wanted to confide right away but knew her time was limited and that there would be no benefit to making everything awkward in her remaining time. He might take some time to be upset but telling her no, you never could have ever loved her seems cruel. She got a very short period with the comforting knowledge you \"could have loved her\" and the two of you get a lifetime of actual love. \n\nI really hope this helps. Try not to feel guilty about this. You did the kindest thing possible, you were not at all unfaithful and truly there would be no benefit to decimating your/her family support system right now. You're all dealing with truma and grief, there is not need to compound it. \n\nStay strong you are a wonderful person and you can navigate these waters.  There will be time  to sort out the details later, right now take every minute you have with your friend and try to arrange for some grief counselling session for later. I wish you the very best \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA yikes\n\nETA Danny is being manipulative and gross. You\u2019re SO deserves better truly. He\u2019s paying for al of her stuff and her bills for her to pull this on you? absolutely not. last moments or not nothing she did is okay", "If you do not tell your partner then yes YTA absolutely 1000%. I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s dying or not she was ABSOLUTELY out of line and so were you with saying you would have been with her. \n\nHow dare your \u201cfriend\u201d do that?! She is real ballsy to do that when your partner is PAYING FOR HER CARE AND LETTING HER LIVE WITH YOU. You need to tell him. If he cuts off funds for her care then oh fucking well, those are the consequences to her actions and she absolutely deserves it. It\u2019s so wrong to hide this from your partner so he pays for the care of a woman that made moves on his partner knowing HE is the one footing bill for her care. If he stops paying for anything and kicks her out, it serves her right. Her family or some other schmuck can pay. Kinda hope he dumps you too for playing along, that was disrespectful af to your relationship", "OP, you're playing a dangerous game with your future. You're so worried about your friend that you're not thinking enough about your relationship.  Of course, morally you know you should tell your partner when someone in your lives asked you to cheat on them.  \n\nBut practically, what happens if your friend decides she wants you to herself in her last few days, gets drunk, and tells your partner that you confessed feelings for her? What if she lies and says you two were intimate that night? \n\nI know all your thoughts are about protecting your friend, but you need to consider what lying (by onission) will do to your relationship. Your partner deserves the truth.", "NTA\n\nThe conversation was inappropriate in that Danny put you into an impossible position.

I appreciate it.", "I really appreciate the kind words and the advice, thank you. I\u2019ll keep that in mind. It didn\u2019t feel like a lie in the moment, but looking back it was one. It led to her thinking I had some sort of romantic feelings for her, which isn\u2019t really true.\n\nBut my boyfriend isn\u2019t violent or an asshole or any of that. Also no cults, haha. We are the same age. We have a really good relationship but he\u2019s also young and a bit hot headed. If I did tell him, he would be very upset with her for hitting on me and probably be upset with me for not telling him sooner and that wouldn\u2019t be great for anyone involved. I would understand him feeling upset/betrayed in normal circumstances but this is a unique situation. I don\u2019t think she would have said what she said if she wasn\u2019t stressed out from the cancer and terrified about the future so I think she deserves a pass because things have been really horrible. But he wouldn\u2019t really see it that way. But yes, no reason to escalate things and better to pretend the whole thing didn\u2019t happen. Thank you again.", "Great. The toxic straight people showed up. Go away", "Not sure what the other commenter was referring to, but I\u2019m not chill with how jealous you say your boyfriend would get.

I worked as a bartender for awhile and he was not happy about people hitting on me, but it wasn\u2019t that serious. He just gets a little jealous\n\nBut no, he\u2019s not jealous of Danny in the slightest. He has his own best friend that he would move mountains for, so he gets it. Like I said, he is totally fine with us spending time alone together, going on vacations alone, etc because he gets we are best friends and he trusts me.

Your a terrible boyfriend to let him continue paying for her knowing what you know.", "NTA\n\nWow. That's a ton of emotional manipulation your bff dumped on you at a very vulnerable moment. You did your best to emotionally support your dying friend while she took advantage of your love and care to demand more than you're comfortable giving. Those bad feelings are your vulnerabilities/boundaries telling you they've been violated. You did okay navigating that unexpected and very uncomfortable situation. You tried to give her validation for her feelings, but her requiring action \"to prove it\" was beyond what you were comfortable \"giving.\"\n\nYou can't control or manage other adults' emotional states. You tried to find a space a little bit outside your comfort zone to comfort your dying friend. That led to her pushing further. This is a life lesson for you.

But you are for some reason feeling guilty.  Telling your boyfriend will hurt him and make you feel better.  Is that what you want?", "NTA. Nothing happened, do not tell your partner.", "You were kind. You let her think it was possible, which seemed to be her wish. There is no need to cause drama by trying to explain to your boyfriend, especially since he is extremely jealous. Leave it alone. You're NTA", "NTA\n\nWelcome to adulthood. Sometimes it is better to keep things to yourself, no matter how much you want to tell them to the people who are important to you. Think about who would benefit if you told your boyfriend this (no-one?) and who could be hurt (all three of you?). You are in a very painful situation with the imminent loss of your bff, my advice is to try not to make it even harder for everyone. You did a kind thing for your bff, just let it stay that way.", "YTA you cheated. thats it. imagine if you were a dude and hanging out with a best friend who confessed to you and you in turn enabled the situation with your comment... feel awful for your atm \"bf\"", "You told a dying woman that if you weren\u2019t with the man you love you could see you and her being in a relationship in a hypothetical situation and then you declined to kiss her. \n\nI worry about your relationship if your partner would be upset at you. You did a kindness for your dying friend. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy if he would be mad at you, him being jealous isn\u2019t a good thing. \n\nYou are NTA for saying no to her but your relationship isn\u2019t in a great space if he would have been mad at you.", "NAH - she is panicking about dying, who wouldn't? especially so young.\n\n>He is a really jealous person, he would not be OK with me not telling him about this.\n\nThis worries me though.", "Fascinating how everyone you know is named Danny.  I call BS", "NTA It was not something Danny should have brought up, but since she did and it's over now, I think you can relax.", "NTA.\n\n>I feel a ton of guilt. I feel like I did wrong by my bf because I know he would not be happy about that conversation. \n\nI really don't see why he would be angry. You made it clear that your BF comes before everyone else and didn't even give her a pity kiss. Stop feeling guilty.", "NTA. She sprung this information on you unexpectedly. You've been a friend, a really good friend for years. You were absolutely loyal to your BF and kind to your friend; you should not be feeling guilt.\n\nWhen I (57f) was in college I had a close friend named Cindy. We had classes together, played softball together and even worked out together occasionally. Not super close, but very friendly. Heck, we even went on double-dates with guys together. Then one evening I went by to pick her up to go out on the town. She invites me in to see her new couch (yea, right) and insisted I have a glass of wine.\n\nCindy goes on to tell me that I am gay and I just didn't realize it yet. I was dumbstruck. I politely said \"no, not at all\" and then we chatted and I asked her a few questions as she was my first gay friend. I left alone and went out with our other friends. Luckily I was living at home that summer and when I woke up I told my parents about it; they've always been really open minded. My Dad told me \"She is telling you what *she wants to be true*. It doesn't mean it *is* true.\"\n\nI don't know if that helps you at all, but you're not alone in being surprised by this kind of situation.\n\nPersonally, I prolly would keep this to myself and not tell Danny. It could only hurt all 3 of you.  Let him have good memories of your friend after she's passed on.", "I would also delete this post and not tell ANYONE.", "All this", "Nothing changed between OP and boyfriend or Danny, but her complete lack of respect for OP\u2019s boyfriend could dramatically change the relationship between her and boyfriend, and that should matter to OP too. I can cut her some slack considering the circumstances, but that\u2019s still a betrayal of someone who considers her family, and OP giving their boyfriend no say in whether or not that impacts his relationship with her isn\u2019t okay at all.", "NTA\nThis comment sounds harsh and angry. Let her die because she was out of line drunk, for which she apologised the next day? She is dying at 23, FFS. \n\nAnd her best friend telling a white lie to comfort her? Good on him! I wouldn't be angry at him if he were my partner, jealous, yes, but proud to have someone caring and soft-hearted in my life.", "My thoughts exactly. What comes out of Danny\u2019s mouth the next time she gets drunk? She\u2019s already proven she has a poor filter on this front.", "This.", "If she's actually in love, I can understand. More important than anything else.", "Right? This comment section is ridiculous and OP is a shitty boyfriend and shitty person", "Her part of the conversation was very inappropriate", "Naw, tell a therapist. She needs to get into grief counseling now so when Danny passes she has a support system established and someone who knows everything.\n\nDefinitely delete the post though.", "And also this.", "Yes, realizing that time is short. She shot her shot.  OP needs to relax.  You just talked to a friend and had no intention of doing anything and you didn\u2019t.  The fact you mention you bf jealousy makes me wonder if you are more afraid of him than anything else.", "It absolutely isn\u2019t harsh foh with that. She knew what she was doing and she\u2019s well aware the partner she\u2019s trying to get her friend to cheat on is footing the bill for her care. You don\u2019t shit where you eat. Him cutting off any funds for her care is the consequences to her own actions. She can either pick up private insurance on her own, get government insurance, or her family can care for her. If I were the person paying for her care then she would ABSOLUTELY be dropped from my insurance.and I\u2019d be ditching him and kicking him out of my home for the \u201cwhite lie\u201d (which it is not) he\u2019d be dropped too. Both would be kicked out of my life as both of them disrespected me and my relationship and I\u2019d be blasting them everywhere.", "I understand the \"she's dying, don't hold it against her,\" perspectives in this thread.  But she hasn't stopped dying and she still has access to booze, so why wouldn't we expect a repeat as she gets even closer to the end? One drunk confession and OP's 7 year relationship is over.", "I think OP is male, hence him saying he would be into his friend if he was straight in his lie, but otherwise I agree", "I think it's always concerning when someone has jealousy issues, even more so when the jealous person's partner excuses it or waives it away, like OP has done here.", "Op needs to relax ?? Tf his so called friend tried to manipulate him into cheating in his bf with her", "Some degree of jealousy is normal, but the fact it\u2019s mentioned means it may be more than minor.", "She\u2019s dying for god sakes.  I think that one could forgive her impropriety.", "Gotcha! I was thinking the jealously was more of an overbearing thing, not a smaller thing. I\u2019m glad y\u2019all are working with what works for y\u2019all! I would also be kinda weirded out by calling the relationship with Danny a sibling one now because of what happened but I would try to just jump that hurdle because of the situation. I hope that knowing you love her (as a friend and sister) is enough for her", ">I usually think his jealousy is cute.\n\nIt's not, OP.  It's not.", "Yeah, the way that you dodge around saying exactly what you mean makes this all more worrying rather than less. When you say \"he just gets a little jealous\", what does that *mean*?", ">He is a really jealous person, he would not be OK with me not telling him about this.\n\nSomehow it feels like this is NOT cute or safe at all.", "So because she\u2019s dying that automatically absolves her from being an asshole ??she could have kept that question to herself knowingly asking someone to cheat on their significant other just because you\u2019re dying does not change my opinion she\u2019s an asshole manipulative one at that too", "I mean I wouldn\u2019t yell at her over it but I wouldn\u2019t speak to her anymore.", "You\u2019ve apparently never assessed your own mortality.  We only have one spin on the rock my friend.  You can assess the morality of the situation from the black and white view of a Victorian or you can attempt to have empathy from someone who is staring death in the face.", "Yea you\u2019re right im not the type of person to ask a friend to cheat on the person they\u2019re with with me no matter what kind of situation I\u2019m in . You can condone that all you want I know I won\u2019t"]}
