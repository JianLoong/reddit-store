I agreed and came down Friday and we talked. My parents said that they've been delaying doing their wills for so long and decided it's finally time to get their affairs in order. I have a brother who's older than me, but he's autistic and I don't know if non-verbal is the right word as he can only say a few words like mom and dad and although he's 26 it's more like he's a ten-year-old if that makes sense.\n\nMy parents told me they've got some sort of plan to go into the will and they've said their plan is if one of them were to die first then my brother will live with the lone parent part-time and a care home/assisted facility part-time to give the lone parent a break. Then if the lone parent dies the plan is for my brother to come and live with me and they will set some sort of trust up so that each month whatever he is inherits goes into living costs for example if he inherited $100,000.00 (not the actual amount) a trust would have been set up and $1,000.00 comes out each month to cover his living costs. \n\nWhy I said my brother has the mind of a ten-year-old is because he can't do anything without the help of our parents like getting him dressed, cleaned and ready and helping him with tasks and activities. My family members take it turns at the weekend to have him so my parents can have a break to relax and recuperate. \n\nI know it's wrong of me and I shouldn't be but I'm not an emotional person and I'm not sympathetic as well. I said to my parents that I'm not giving up my career to look after him and when they both die I won't be taking him in. My brother and 's sibling relationship is non-existent and I also don't feel equipped to look after him I am an honest person and will say that to me he would feel like a massive burden. I voiced my reasoning to my parents and I thought they would be more understanding I basically feel he's better off in a place where people can actually help him and know what they're doing. I'm just not prepared to give up my career or anything for him. I also stated to my parents I'm more than happy to give up my half of the inheritance so the money can go on making sure he's looked after like setting up a trust fund so if they died and he went into assisted living facility his bills are paid and there's an allowance for him each month.\n\nMy parents are completely upset with me and are disappointed in me for this. I feel justified but now I'm wondering if I've been a total bitch and an asshole when it's come to this.", "created_utc": 1699821666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tt6xe/aita_for_saying_to_my_parents_that_i_wont_give_up/", "score": 1658, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They also have time to set up a trust with trustees or guardian. To make sure no one is abusing the trust and misusing the money designated for your brother's care, you may want to consider being one of the trustees. It's unfair to expect you to pick up the pieces especially since your brother could be transitioning now when your parents are well and able to oversee his care.", "NTA. Your brother is not your child and you should feel free to live your life. And it's strange that they're willing to put him in an assisted care facility when one of them is still alive but then send him to you when they're both gone. It's mature of you to offer to give up your half of the inheritance so he will be taken care of. That sounds like a good plan. Offer to put it in writing that you won't contest the will: maybe that will set their mind at ease?", "NTA  \n\n\nTheir planning has no business including you. You are your own person, with your own life. Suddenly becoming a fulltime caregiver would be exhausting.  \n\n\nYour plan of giving up any inheritance is well thought out. Your brother would thrive in an assisted living environment. I have seen all of this before.", "NTA.   My 23 year old son is autistic and I also have a 26 year old non special needs daughter who no longer lives at home.  \n\nI have made it quite clear to her that he will not have to come live with her down the line.  She might be his legal representative but not his primary care giver.  He is going to have to go live in a group home. \n\nAlso is your brother getting any money from the government?   Your parents need to be on top of that.  \n\nWhere do you live ?", "I think it\u2019s weird that they feel if one of dies, the other parent deserves a break and put your brother in assisted living part-time, but you would have to do 100% of the caring. That\u2019s not fair and should never be expected of a sibling. Also, a ten year old can bathe and say more than ten words, your brother sounds like he\u2019s mentally a toddler.

That's a joke right? They get to put him part time in a facility to get a break but screw you and your entire life? He's 26. He could live another 50 years! It's not going to cover his living expenses anyway. \n\nI'm also disappointed by reality. Your parents need to make realistic plans, not in my Disney fantasy, our other kid agrees to take an adult sized five year for their entire life.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother is your parents\u2019 responsibility. They need to make the necessary plans now so that when either or both pass then his care is taken care of. \n\nAnd that is NOT to be you. \n\nYou are not to sacrifice your life to care for your brother. \n\nHe is not your child. Your parents are asking too much here and should not be guilting or punishing you for knowing your limits.", "NTA. I have three adult children. My middle son has severe autism and is non-verbal. He lives in a group home. He has an older sibling that is not the first person responsible for him if something happens to us. We did that on purpose. It's not right to penalize your other children because they have a sibling with special needs. You have the right idea.\n\nAll children need their independence when they grow up, not just neurotypical ones. And our son lives in a group home because he used to be violent, and I would either be dead or in a mental home myself if he lived with us 24/7.", "NTA, I know its family, but that's their kid they decided to have. You were honest and upfront and let them know this was not something you wanted to be in charge of, I do not blame you at all!", "NTA.  Even if you wanted to care for him, not everyone has the skills, the money, and the setup to care for someone with the needs your brother has. Finding a facility that does and one you can check on so he has the best possible life is best for both of you.", "NTA. Am in a similar position.\n\nYour parents planning had no plan to include you in that plan? They assumed you would take over as carer. No no. I guarantee you have already sacrificed plenty in your years, on account of your brother. \n\nSounds harsh but he really isn't your problem.", "NTA\n\nI'm the mother of an autistic son, I'm friends to another mother with a child in the spectrum.\n\nOur children are on the higher side of the IQ-spectrum. \n\nYet: it is exhausting. \n\nI love my child dearly and some day he will be able to live on his own.\n\nBut my friend is a single parent, she is not able to work and lives of social security although her son is intelligent, can speak, etc. and she is on the verge of a breakdown.\n\nHaving to care for an adult that hardly speaks and has the additional problems of autism like being overly sensitive to noises, tastes, light, ... is a job better to be done by experts.\n\nJust because he is in a facility doesn't mean you don't take care that his caregivers look for him properly, etc...\n\nYou still can visit him. \n\nBut you can't take care for him 24/7", "NTA - it's my understanding that people on spectrum, are not good with multiple changes in their life. If he will be PT in a facility when there is only 1 parent left, why not prepare for him to move into FT after the 2nd parent passes.", "NTA. This is not sufficient planning for such a high needs person, not at all. If both of your parents are gone, it\u2019s not your responsibility to care for brother. They need to make more explicit plans, like finding a group home or other professional situations where knowledgeable people can help him.\n\nThey are asking way too much of you.", "NTA. It is not realistic of them to expect you to put your life on hold, or drastically change its trajectory, to care for him.   The same programs they were going to use if one of them passes are the same programs that should be used when both of them have gone.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I know it's wrong of me and I shouldn't be\" ..

Set your boundaries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were right to tell them directly - now they can set up a care home for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut: they sound like AHs, you might need to go no contact to escape their guilting and abusive manipulation.", "NTA.  They need to make arrangements for him to be in an assisted living facility when they are both gone.  Assure them that you will make sure he\u2019s safe and cared for but it won\u2019t be by you.", "NTA.  You're not abandoning him to die on the street, and it's unreasonable for your parents to demand that you give up your life for him.  They want you to take over their job, but parenthood is a choice that they made, not you.", "nta, realistically even if they left you everything I doubt there is enough money there to cover his and your costs for life. what did they expect you to live off? basically if you are looking after him that trust would need to provide living costs for both of you. do they understand that? \n\nyour brother does not have the mind of a 10 year Old, I remember getting ready for secondary school at 10. he is a toddler if he can't dress himself sorry. this is not something you should have to deal with. what happens when he is even older and needs physical help?", "Even if your sibling is put into a care facility, They would need a guardian to sign of on medical treatment, etc. From what I understand, whilst the state can appoint someone, it is always best if it is a family member. \n\nIn addition, the trust will need a trustee to manage it.\n\nWould you be willing to take on these roles if you were to have your sibling be in a care facility?", "NTA.  They're trying to strong arm you into agreeing by making it appear as if this is a done deal when it's not even been discussed.  I'm sure they're scared about what will happen to your brother after they pass (or become incapable of caring for him).  But the solution isn't to assume you'll give up your life.  You matter.  Your life has value.  (Also look up glass children.  Sounds like it applies here).\n\nYou're absolutely correct that you're not capable of providing the care he will need. Frankly I'm worried they'll think they can provide his care past when they're able to.  Getting old isn't for the faint of heart.  Your physical capabilities diminish over the years.  That's assuming illness or injury doesn't speed along the process.\n\nDecide what you're willing to do.  Some possibilities:\n\n-forgo any inheritance so everything goes to your brother's care (good job being proactive about this)\n\n-send them (or put in an account for your brother) X amount to help with his care.  Either now or once they can't care for him.\n\n-check with his insurance to see if there's anything available that isn't being used (home health aide, respite care etc)\n\n-see what assistance programs he qualifies for (both now and in the future).\n\n-see if there are programs he can participate in (like day camp)\n\n-pay for them to talk to a financial planner\n\nI know some of these have most likely been done.  But keep checking because things can change.  You can help without becoming his full time carer.  Decide what you can/will be able to help with and stick to it.  You're not selfish. You're balancing your life with your brother's care. Your parents way isn't the only option.", "NTA but frankly you should be prepared to inherit nothing as the care he needs is not cheap and they gave to ensure he\u2019s suitably cared for.", "You are NTA. I hope your parents have consulted a really good estate attorney. Assuming you are all in the US, they probably want to set up a special needs trust so your brother is still eligible for SSI and Medicaid. You might agree to oversee the trust, but you're NTA if you don't even want to do that.\n\nThis is a sucky situation for you, your parents and your brother and the *real* asshole is the American disability and healthcare system.", "I have never read a more profound NTA. \nNTA\nNTA\nNTA", "NTA they need to set up a trust, find a home with caretakers for him and leave you out of it. You are not a bitch, not an AH and you are not required to take care of something they should have taken care of a long time ago.

I hope her sister will always want to be a part of her life, but I do not expect her to be the primary caregiver when both me and my husband died", ">I also stated to my parents I'm more than happy to give up my half of the inheritance so the money can go on making sure he's looked after like setting up a trust fund so if they died and he went into assisted living facility his bills are paid and there's an allowance for him each month.\n\nIf you construct the trust and guardianship correctly, Medicare will fund his bills for the facility, there's no need for the inheritance to pay for anything but extras to make him more comfortable. Have your parents actually talked to an attorney, or are they just winging it?", "As an autistic, if you didn't want to be taking care of me the last thing I would want is you taking care of me - NTA\n\nMy ex and I broke up because it was too difficult to take care of me and himself and I completely understand. It's hard to take care of my every need, make sure I'm fed and showered and it's harder to take care of yourself during that. \n\nMy current partner is all in for the challenges; he knows he has to help me shower and make sure I've eaten. I'm so much better off with someone who wants to help me and take care of me than I ever would've been with someone who doesn't want to take care of me or would resent me.\n\nBecause me and my ex broke up, and I understood why (I was the one who finally suggested it) we were able to maintain a friendship. We are the same as we were minus the expectation to take care of me. He's still my closest friend cause we both admitted what we needed, and you not being able to provide that doesn't make you a bad person.", "NTA. \n\nWould some siblings do this for their brother or sister? Yes. Does that mean you have to do it for yours? Absolutely not. He is your brother, not your child. They could've asked? Yes, and you could've still said no.

I've seen where an unprepared family member cares for their disabled relative and the relative ends up being very isolated.

Your parents can help him with the transition and help instruct the group home about what he likes and dislikes, his favorite foods, favorite activities, things he really hates and can't be around, etc.-- things that might be difficult for someone who is quasi-verbal to convey to new people. If there are problems with the group home or it isn't a good setting for him, your parents will be there to respond and sort it out and find a different place if necessary. They can visit him there very frequently, bring him home on weekends and for holidays and outings, and gradually develop a situation where he feels comfortable there and with the people there, rather than waiting till one of them dies and then bouncing him back and forth between a disrupted home and a totally new place. Then, if you are amenable to being his legal guardian, you can make necessary decisions, hopefully visit him and include him in your life to the degree that makes sense for both of you, but he can stay in a group home with trained staff and people he is by then familiar with.", "NTA\n\nYou've been honest.", "I vote with you on this.

The staff who hate it don\u2019t last, they would rather earn similar money doing a less stressful job and have an easy life. \nThe service users I worked with had great lives with packed schedules and a committed occupational therapist that had a timetable of activities for each resident daily. We were never allowed to just stay at the home doing nothing, we had to plan the days so we went out at least once a day and planned the rest of the day to keep service users happy and occupied. \n\nI met a lot of family members who were terrified that the client we were caring for might get abused, the truth is that most clients require 2-1 or more care. Residents aren\u2019t often left alone with one staff member and if there was even a sniff of abuse the other staff would report it. \n\nI understand OP\u2019s parents want to do the best for their son but it doesn\u2019t have to come at a cost to their daughters life.

Then he can gradually start the process of living there full time with lots of visits from parents at the home and lots of taking him home for weekends and outings. The parents can check in and make sure he's doing well there, and can alert the staff to things he needs, things he likes, things he hates, etc. that might be hard for a nonverbal person to communicate to new people at first. Then by the time his parents are gone, he will have a familiar place and familiar people to support him at the group home/assisted living place. They can set up a trust, and if OP is up to it she can be a trustee or legal guardian for him while he lives at the home, and can visit him/bring him for visits if that makes sense for them. \n\nOne of my friends has a high support needs autistic brother, similar to OP's. Their parents are both healthy and in their early 60s, but have already set him up in a group home that he now really likes, with lots of family visits there and at the parents' home, outings to his favorite places, etc. He's developed a lot more independence and seems to be really happy there. His sister plans to continue visiting him and taking him for outings a lot after their parents are gone, and being his legal guardian, but he will remain at the group home. There's no expectation that she sacrifice her career and her life to take care of him, and in fact her parents had several back-up options had she said she didn't want to be his guardian, but she wants to do that. Once the kids were adults, they included both of them and their input in all of the planning.

They only do that 40 hours a week and get time off. Caregivers often burn out.\n\nWhen she came and visited her parents for the holidays, she told me she was just visiting her mom and dad because she's an adult and lives on her own. She liked her 'independence' at moving into an adult care home.\n\nMy family has a severely disabled daughter. They run a non-profit daycare for developmentally disabled adults. For 40 hours a week, the adults come to their facility and have group trips. The care home bus picks them up. They get dropped off. They do arts and crafts, songs, have independent play time and directed activities. Sometimes, they do fundraisers and the clients make art to donate. It's awesome. They get to have friends and the parents get a break. Nobody is charged to attend. It's fully funded by donations and grants.\n\nThe adults doing those types of setups get a sense of independence, daily interactions and developmentally appropriate activities. They have friends.\n\nWe had a care home near a restaurant I worked at, mostly for veterans with TBIs. Those guys had a lot of freedom and visited us all the time. One always asked me if we were best friends. (Of course we're best friends, Steven. 'I'm getting my big check from disability soon. When my check comes in, I'll take you to Disneyland. Best friends go to Disneyland.' That sounds awesome, Steven. Steven was my favorite.)\n\nA little bit of independence is a good thing. It also means the family can check on them all the time because they are around to check on them and can make sure the facility is taking good care of their family member. We had people doing random, unannounced checks for my grandparents. Why wouldn't you want that for your disabled adult child? Check in, make sure they settle, do well, are somewhere safe.\n\nIf you have the means or social net to do so - moving them early can not only let them settle but give them a ton of daily enrichment they might not otherwise get.
