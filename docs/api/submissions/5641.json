OP, even if they stopped smoking hours before you got there a house smoked in for years will always have that third hand exposure in it. But to not even make the effort of not smoking inside that day and airing the shit out of everything is so unhinged for people who *want* your kids to visit. NTA obviously. personally I wouldn't take them there period. it's not you who's damaging the relationship like some comments say, it's them damaging it because they're unwilling to make the small sacrifice of giving up not even smoking altogether, but just smoking inside. for one (1) day.", "NTA. My parents smoked non stop when I was growing up. I was 10 years old and cough really bad and out came a GLOB of tar. My mothers freaked out on me accusing me of smoking. I swore I wasn\u2019t. Looking back that was all from second hand smoking.", "NTA.  Even if they stopped smoking inside DAYS earlier, that nasty smell still lingers in the furniture, so it will transfer to your kids\u2019 clothes & hair.  Side note:  anyone who says air fresheners will get rid of the aroma has obviously gone nose blind, because that will only add flowers (or whatever scent) on top of the smoke.

They weren\u2019t actively lighting up and blowing it in your kids faces - kids weren\u2019t even there. Keeping their grandkids from them on Christmas because they were smoking before they got there is pretty out of line.", "Wait, let me get this straight.

You are damaging your relationship with your parents and depriving your children of spending time with grandparents.", "Thank you for being polite smoker. Unfortunately there are not many like you.", "Hahahaha!", "Thats literally what she did. She was refusing to allow them to smoke with the kids inside by not taking the kids inside. She doesn't suck. We cut off my MIL for a similar reason. She knew my son had already been hospitalized before with asthma complications. She still refused to put out her cigarette bc it was her house. He ended up in the hospital again even though we left and now we have zero contact with her. We don't suck, she does. And OP doesn't suck either.", "it\u2019s not out of line at all.

The chemicals in smoke don\u2019t just stop existing just because active smoking isn\u2019t taking place.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "Do you know how toxic is the enviroment where people smoke inside? My SIL had to do similar boundary with her MIL because her son got asthma attacks like 10 minutes in her house where she wasn't actively smoking. He ended up in hospital two times after visit at her grandma flat. And doctors clearly said that he shouldn't be in this enviroment or he can end up with damaged lungs and full time oxygen support at 2 years old. It's not what is wrong with OP, but what is wrong with their parents that they rather endanger their grandkids just because they are addicts who need therapy.", "Second hand smoke kills. She is not saying they cannot smoke in their home. Just not around the kids. If they want to smoke, fine. Her kids just won't be there. She's being a decent mom.", "How entitled can someone be knowing they could harm a child and refusing to stop? These people make me so mad. I was so sick when I lived with my smoking mother and once she moved out I rarely got sick. Thank you for being a good parent.", "Clearly, I disagree so I don\u2019t know why you replied to me to directly. Secondhand smoke is when the tobacco is actively burning, not the lingering smell it leaves. So if they aren\u2019t actively smoking, it isn\u2019t secondhand smoke.", "They didn\u2019t smoke around the kids. The children were not allowed in the home. OP saw their parents smoking before she went in, and refused to let the kids see their grandparents. \n\nThere is nothing in the OPs version of events to indicate that they claimed to have quit smoking. So this seems like a premeditated fight to hurt them the most. Instead of the big family Christmas they had been looking forward to and had no doubt spent a lot of money on, they were then told they couldn\u2019t see their grandkids. \n\nHow did the kids feel when after being all excited about seeing their grandparents and having a big Christmas feast they were then driven back home to a normal dinner despite not doing anything wrong?", "And breaking ties with grandparents leaves permanent marks. They were not smoking AROUND your kids, they were smoking inside the house. You could have easily ventilated the whole building in less than a minute. So why the drama?", "Honestly it was the last straw. She had a whole host of issues like the only reason she did it was bc she was mad at my BIL and we wouldn't pick sides. She did it to be petty and made my son sick. After that we were done.", "It's called thirdhand smoke and it's still dangerous.", "people don\u2019t wanna expose children to smoke anymore. it doesn\u2019t matter if they weren\u2019t lighting up in front of them they broke her boundaries. i responded to you directly bc the grandparents are not entitled to see their grandchildren. they aren\u2019t entitled to anything if they constantly disrespect their kid and grandkids.", "I agree.  There is no reason the grandparents can't smoke outside the rest of the day.  \n\nAs a smoker, I personally would have started smoking outside earlier in the day to avoid the flack and sprayed a lot of air freshener.", "Her first paragraph says she keeps asking them not to do it and they agree and then forget. Meaning they smoke around the kids again. There are long lasting effects on children from second hand smoke. Even just venting it out will still leave you with particles and it freaking stinks. I'm glad the mom is doing the right thing and you can cry about it. NTA!", "She said in the first paragraph that she's asked them to quit smoking around the kids and they eventually do it again. That sounds like forget and light up with the kids there. It's not severing the grandparents away. It's putting a foot down on something dangerous.", "And she also said in her last paragraph that she didn't even take the kids out of the car, ergo they did not smoke around the kids, did they? Or am I missing something here?", "They didn't smoke around the kids this time. How many times does she have to ask them not to do it before she is allowed to stop the kids from going in?", "Her ultimatum was not to smoke around the kids. They did not smoke around the kids. If she let the kids out and the parents refused or forgot to turn those cigs off, then yes, she would be in the right. This time, though, she's in the wrong. They complied with her instructions and did not smoke around the kids.", "They were smoking knowing they were going to be there soon. That doesn't sound like they care that much if they wanted to see the kids. How hard is it to just not light a new one?", "Again, the ultimatum was not to smoke AROUND the kids, not quit altogether.", "And again she said they will promise not to and then forget and light up."]}
