According to the law?  \nIn the context of \"here are the fair and explainable boundaries for me to bring my kids here\", then yes, fucking yes one may dictate certain behaviors as a guest and a family member.  \nThat's simply good parenting, it's self respect and knowing ones worth, and it's certainly not being an asshole.", "NYA and honestly, even being around them after they smoke is harmful.

Second-hand smoke is super harmful. If you smoke around a second person, you are harming them. I wouldn't tolerate someone smoking around *me*, and I'm an adult - because if I wanted to deal with the negative health impacts, I would just smoke *myself*. I choose not to take that risk, and I expect any smokers in my life to respect that and *not* undermine that decision.\n\nSmoking around *children* is inexcusable.", "NTA I completely agree", "NTA your children's health is your priority, not tiptoeing around your parents ' addiction. They made their choice, they can live with it", "Absolutely NTA... My parents who are divorced now are both smokers and so are their new partners. My entire life, my mom and dad NEVER smoked inside the house and went out to the terrace to do that.  So does my boyfriend and that's absolutely okay with me.\n\nYour parents are unthoughtful and too comfortable to change habits, which in itself is just laughable and sad at the same time.", "NTA I had two grandparents who smoked back in the 70s. Due to antosmoking commercials and being young, I thought smoking was akin to russian roulette and became hysterical when they would light  up. They eventually quit as ac result.\n\nEven with that change, I battled asthma as a child and other breathing issues due to the years of exposure. They both died young from complications from smoking and, worst, all their grandchildren became smokers.\n\nI quit at 40, my brother battles with quitting. Smoking is like leaving your children with an alcoholic or drug addict, it has long lasting behavioral implications.\n\nTo put it simply, grandparents are often cool Santa type figures. If they smoke, it must be cool. When i grow up, that underlying message plays out.\n\nGood for you for standing up for your kids.", "NTA at all, I refuse to step into my moms house for this reason.

Good on you for doing whats best for your children. My ex MIL smokes, but does not smoke around my kid and even goes our of her way to smoke outside, out of sight, and keeps it down to maybe two smokes a day when we see her. Grown ups should understand that their choice to smoke, does not mean others need to endure it.", "NTA. My mom enforced this rule with my grandparents and they immediately went *cold turkey* after smoking for 40+ years. It\u2019s doable, granted very difficult.

Grandma was more conservative with only 1 to 1 1/2 packs. My sister was born with medical issues. They never smoked indoors around us (only outdoors).

Putting your children's welfare first.  And you're not telling them they can't smoke. Just that you won't tolerate them smoking around your kids.\n\nAnd that, if they want to see their grandchildren, they must come to your house, where smoking is not allowed.  \n\nWhen they come over your house, I would take their cigarettes and put them in a locked box until they leave, so they don't \"forget\" not to smoke.\n\nOf course, they could try to quit smoking, because it's a very expensive, nasty habit, and the problem would be solved.  But I understand it's an incredibly hard habit to break because nicotine is extremely addictive.", "NTA\n\nThat is the stance I should have taken with my step father when my kids were babies.\n\nHe didn't smoke in my house, but he refused to be told he couldn't smoke in other places.\n\nShould've packed up the kids and left, but there were others at the house for Christmas so we sucked it up that time.\n\nNow we just don't go to their house ever. My mother is not happy with that, but she deals.", "NTA. My grandfather smoked and while I loved him, I hated being in their house for long periods. After we would come home from a visit, my mom would have us all take showers, wash our hair, and put our clothes in the washing machine. \n\nTo this day, I can\u2019t stand the smell.

Still, he doesn't struggle with this. I never asked him not to smoke either, but he did it either way (I don't smoke at all).", "For real. Take away the moral duty of not smoking near kids or in non-marked areas. Smoking indoors? I have my own place and could smoke inside if I wanted to. But that's fucking gross. I don't want my living area smelling like butts. Or not even just my place. Even if I was somewhere inside that allowed it... like a casino... it just feels grimey. I always go outside to smoke.", "Yeah, my own wife smokes outside and we don\u2019t have kids. Only cats.

Everywhere else it was a dingy yellowish gray. After that she always smoked outside.\n\nMy understanding is that it gets into furniture fibers, curtains, everything, so if you're in a house where someone has been smoking, you absolutely will be affected by it whether they're actively smoking at that moment, or not.\n\nNTA OP!", "Right? I quit over a decade ago but I was always an outside smoker", "This honestly baffles me growing up with two smoker parents who always did it outside", "I no longer smoke, but in actually,  most smokers are very polite about it. I don't know a single smoker who would ever dream of lighting up in another person's home or car.  Every smoker I know tries to fine a space far away from people to smoke when possible and know enough not to smoke around kids.\n\nI haven't smoked in 7 years and literally I haven't had a single smoking person encroach on me or my space. The problem is that the small percentage of impolite or rude smokers are the people who truly stick out because of their entitled attitude and they are quite easy to remember", ">But don't worry.

A substantial amount of cocaine, nicotine, or heroin addicts are pretty polite.", "In my country it's illegal to smoke outside of any place that sells food. You have to be a certain distance away from the front door. If you're caught, you get fined, the business gets fined, *and* the individual staff member gets fined for \"letting it happen\".\n\nI still regularly have to remind people, sometimes multiple times, that they actually *cannot* smoke at our outside tables, because it's against the law - and that I will kick them out if they keep doing it, because I'm not willing to pay the fine for their actions. And even then, they'll often just try to hide it under the table, as if I'm stupid and won't notice.", "This. People get *so* angry when you ask them not to smoke right next to you - that goes for cigarettes *and* weed (I know weed's not as harmful - but breathing *anything* except air is harmful to an extent, and honestly, weed smells fucking gross. So I don't like people smoking either right in front of me). \n\nLike dude, I didn't consent to breathing in your fumes. I don't care if you smoke, just have the basic respect to *not* do it immediately next to a non-smoker.", "You realize the confirmation bias on that though, right? You're not going to smell/notice the smokers that don't smell like it, only those that do.\n\nI've worked with people for *years* that don't smoke and didn't realize I did because they had just never seen me smoke. Not smoking indoors, in vehicles, overall hygiene, and frankly just what type of cigarettes someone smokes makes a huge difference in if you can smell a smoker.", "My dad smokes. He always goes outside to do it even when he is living alone. He refuses to smoke in cars as well. I'm asthmatic since birth, and he has always done what he can to keep me safe from his choices, but if I go sit with him while he is smoking, that's on me. One thing I did notice the first time I went home after moving out was how much my lungs had \"healed\" in the year apart. I know any damage is already done, and I will never hold it against my dad, but I wouldn't stop him from seeing my kids. However, if he smoked inside damn right, I wouldn't allow myself or my children to enter his house. OP, keep up the good work protecting you kids.", "When I was young, in my 20s, I briefly went to clubs.  Although I don't smoke, I would always come home reeking of smoke even after I showered.\n\nI stopped going to clubs not long after that.", "I used to wear surgical gloves to smoke to hide the smell.

My husband was fooled for a while if I would only have a few each day.", "As a smoker who\u2019s quitting for the idk how many attempts right now, I can attest to cheap cigarettes smelling much more awful. We have several smokers at work and no issues ever. We hired a temp guy for the holidays who smokes the cheapest on the market and whenever he works the back reeks, then he hangs his coat up smushed up against everyone else\u2019s\u2026", "Perhaps tad unreasonable, but then, the clothes will still carry hazardous particles ending up in your lungs if inhaled. Don't hold babies after a cigarette without changing, folks.", "No, I don't want them to smoke at all.  It is a disgusting, filthy habit.  To me, they smell 24 hours a day.  Their cars smell, their hair smells, their clothes smell.  It comes out of their pores.  They take a shower and still smell, and then put on clothes from a closet that smells.  If you are a smoker, you can't get rid of the stink.\n\nI find it funny that people could think that stepping outside to suck on a cancer stick makes it OK.  Smokers are so unaware.  Half of them toss their butts on the ground or out their car windows when they are done.\n\nI view it the same as if someone stood next to me and continually farted.  They would smell too."]}
