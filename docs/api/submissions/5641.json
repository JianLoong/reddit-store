You have to be almost completely nose blind to not be able to identify the smokers in your life.", "Maybe, but unfortunately those not polite are very common and they are pretty aggressive. I was verbally attacked by my neighbour when I asked her to smoke on the other side of balcony so the smoke is not going straight into my kids bedroom (she lives in flat under ours) and I was called so many names, some I even didn't knew. All for asking to go four steps to the left when she smokes. Because of her I was forced to buy dryer, because any laundry on the balcony is ready to get washed again because of the smell and air puryfier when I'm not quick enough to close the window. Those were pretty expensive things we didn't need until she moved into the flat under.", "> there are a lot of us polite smokers! you don\u2019t notice us because we are polite!!!\n\nlike the smokers I know will at least take it outside, worst that happens from my perspective is they smell bad for a few minutes after coming back in\n\nthat's a common irony whatever the subject, it's less noticeable when things are working as they should be", "\u201cYou could have easily ventilated the whole building in less than a minute.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s actually not true.

And any objects that those clothes and hands have touched. \n\n\u201cSo why the drama?\u201d\nThe drama is that the parents didn\u2019t keep their word. Though you are correct that it is not their household, OP asked her parents if they could make accommodations and they agreed. OP also stated that she told them they could go to her house instead if they cannot stop smoking for the duration of their visit. \n\nThe parents don\u2019t *have* to stop smoking, because you\u2019re right, it\u2019s their house. But OP doesn\u2019t have to go over there and allow them to spend time with the kids if they won\u2019t stop doing something toxic around them, because they\u2019re her kids and it\u2019s her choice. \n\n\u201cBreaking ties with grandparents leaves permanent marks.\u201d In this case, that\u2019s not her fault or her problem. If the grandparents want to spend time with the kids but cannot stop smoking around them at their house, they were welcomed to go to OP\u2019s non smoking house.
