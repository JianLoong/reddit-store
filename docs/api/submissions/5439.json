She needs to accept the consequences and take responsibility for her actions.\n\nShe lets her mother steamroll her, let's her live in HER house that she pays for while you guys struggle and she probably knuckles under every time her mother has a tantrum.  The mother hasn't even helped you guys in any way despite living close and you guys housing her.\n\nWhy would the mother think this time is any different?  She knows if she has a fit, her daughter will give in.  That's the dynamic of their relationship.\n\nYou can't create a monster and then whine when it stomps on a few buildings.  If you want things to change, you need to start changing the dynamic of the relationship.  I agree with the other redditers here and think selling the house the mother lives in would be a good start.\n\nAlso, tell the mother to stay home if she's not happy to go on vacation the way it's been planned, that she better get used to the new order because things are going to change and her pulling her manipulation and guilt trips to get her way isn't going to work anymore, that you've enabled her entitlement long enough.\n\nEvery time she starts having a fit, cut her off, say you're not going to entertain her tantrum, and end the conversation.  It's going to be hard at first, but contrary to popular opinion, an old dog can still learn a new trick with enough time and persistence. \n\nMy own very entitled mother tried strongarming me into getting her way about something using guilt tactics at Thanksgiving dinner after I already told her no privately.  She thought doing it in a public forum would have me giving in.  I ripped her a new one calling her out at the table in front of everyone and she's been nice as pie ever since.  She's 80, so if she can learn, so can this mother.\n\nI'm sure the relationship between them will be much healthier once mutual respect can be established and the daughter learns to say no and stick to it.  Right now, the mother does not respect her daughter or you, by extension.  \n\nSorry for how long this got, I just know what it's like having a very entitled parent.", "NTA.

She reminds me of a neighbour who I am not on talking terms with anymore. She is also the kind that she'll be so good to you that you will wonder how you lucked out on first meeting her that you found someone so helpful and understanding. But the moment you don't agree with her on anything or don't listen to her advice she'll show her true colors. Normal people would just think that it's a part of being an adult that you disagree with others from time to time but this female is so vengeful she'll go around bad mouthing people who don't agree with her and will be hostile to them openly only for some silly disagreement.

But please go buy your wife a copy of \u2018When Will I Be Good Enough? Daughters of Narcissistic Mothers\u2019 by Karyl McBride and it will explain the sheer batshittery bomb your MIL is lobbing. It isn\u2019t designed to explode and blow anything up, it\u2019s designed to stun you and confuse you. You were military, what do you call the sort you chuck into a hostage situation to disorient and assert power in the chaos? Flash bangs? It\u2019s that.\n\nThat kind of mother loves that tactic. The point is that normal people are left absolutely unable to grasp it because it if you understood the thinking you too would be bad batshit not driven to feeling batshit. And while you are reeling they have the element of surprise. The book helps you fit ear defenders and put up a riot shield so you stop reacting but can be active.\n\nI grew up with a mother like this and that book saved my life and sanity. I also ironically grew up in conflict era Northern Ireland and realising terrorism is terrorism whether political or emotional helped me detach from my mother in the same way you adjust and normalise and develop healthy coping strategies understanding the dynamics of growing up in a civil war using terrorist tactics.\n\nIt also taught me people who terrorise for their own needs rather than a political cause are not going to change. They like it. It suits them snd as you aren\u2019t actually opposing them and the enemy they have nothing to gain by peace. They lose by giving up their cause unlike people who are one man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter.\n\nMy mum worked with the family of a particularly notorious terrorist back in Belfast. He was released under our peace agreement but it was felt by \u2018all sides\u2019 he was just a straight up pyschopath and bully not an active participant. He hit the motivational speaker circuit after some prison education and some friend of my mum\u2019s was involved and invited her as they both had links. He saw my mum and said \u2018not that crazy fucker. She\u2019s not right in the head.\u2019 He\u2019s back in prison on a whole life tarriff. It involved hand grenades\u2026\n\nI am no contact with my mum. Like him she will\nnever change. The wiring isn\u2019t possible. I can\u2019t stop her blowing shit up but I can remove myself from the blast zone. And I did. It needed police and a lawyer and emigration but she is more unstable than Northern Irish politics and my life is blissfully boringly dull. No drama, no bomb scares, no scanning mentally for snipers. I can just go on a mini break to a spa. It\u2019s surprisingly simple once you find out you aren\u2019t mad and there is a way to evolve past them.\n\nThat book got me started and then I had therapy. Annoyingly it was only in paper copies when I bought it and I urge that your MIL does not get any clues like seeing the book that you are starting to fathom her bullshit so she can adjust. You want the element of surprise but unlike disorienting her, you give yourselves clarity to just be done.\n\nIt will hard but take that military tactic to detach from the high emotion and it is enough distance for you to tag team when she wants to drive a wedge.", "If this happens all the time and wife is paying for her mom's home, she is a saint", "It may not be costing you in terms of money (unless major upkeep items needed, roof, paint, flooring etc), but it\u2019s definitely costing you in terms of boundaries.\n\nFor many relationships this can work, in your case it may be worth exploring ceasing the landlord tenant relationship. I would make sure your spouse is fully informed as to her rights regarding the house just in case.\n\nIt\u2019s easier short term to keep status quo.  Long term damage may be much greater however than the short term costs. Consider all avenues moving forward and best of luck.", "Thank you for this, it's a really interesting viewpoint.

You're a rock star IMO.", "Quite a bit was paid off previously so if/when my wife sells it she will still get some money out of it.

Not sure how the current outburst will affect that long term though.", "Ok, feel much better now for your circumstances.", "Thank you. Yes it was excellent support.

After 15 years we're both at peace now.", "NTA, of course, the MIL's demand that her 70 y.o. BF go on your wife's girl trip is absurd.  But given your MIL's terrible, undermining behavior toward your wife, here are two (real, not rhetorical) questions.  1.) Why is your wife still having enough contact with her mother that her mother is able to berate her like this? 2.) Why is your MIL still living in a house your wife owns, initially causing your nuclear family financial distress?", "NYA. MIL is delusional.", "WTF? Your MIL wants your wife to take MIL's BF on vacation with her?  That is the most absurd thing I think I've heard in a long time!  And now layer on top that your family was in temporary debt because your wife allowed MIL to stay in the home that wife is paying for?\n\nYour wife is NTA and sounds like a victim of extreme emotional abuse.  Why doesn't she evict MIL and go NC?  MIL sounds toxic.", "NTA Your wife deserves to do what SHE wants without her mom interfering, let alone her MBF! \nKeep supporting your wife and let the MIL and BF rot in their own anger.", "I don\u2019t get it - why would MIL want your wife (and her friend) to take her boyfriend on a vacation? Did I read that right?", "NTA this is so incredibly inappropriate and over stepping that I am flabbergasted. Not only would my answer be no but hell no. In fact I would tell both MiL & FIL that they can no longer live in the home without paying rent. At minimum they should be covering the insurance & property taxes. Your wife has been a doormat for so long they think walking all over her is acceptable. They need something else to worry about instead imposing on her trip uninvited. If they don\u2019t back down tell them you are considering selling the house or evicting them.", "INFO: So she wants you to take her boyfriend and not her and her boyfriend? Because that is weird as hell to begin with.", "NTA - she's not just inviting herself along, she's inviting a random man. She can go on her own holiday.", "NTA. Your MIL just wants to screw with your wife. This idea occured to her because who knows why and she thinks she should be able to make her daughter do anything she wants because reasons. Some people are only happy if they're upsetting someone.", "NTA. \n\nWhen people show you who they are don\u2019t be surprised by their behavior. You and your wife are well aware of your MiL behavior and y\u2019all continue to not only allow her in your lives, but your wife pays for her living expenses. Why on earth would either of you entertain her level of narcissistic neediness with nothing but insults and blame in return? \n\nYour MiL has it made in the shade so to speak. Her daughter pays for the roof over her head and; this is an assumption, so tell me if I\u2019m wrong but, I\u2019ll bet she comes and goes to your house as she pleases without asking or knocking. I\u2019m making this assumption because you said she lives 5 min away and she\u2019s very entitled. \n\nI\u2019m going to guess you aren\u2019t your MiL\u2019s biggest supporter, and you\u2019re sick of watching your wife get verbally accosted by this entitled glutton. I know you\u2019re wife is tired of it. Wether she says so or not, believe me she\u2019s exhausted. \n\nShe pays for her mother\u2019s living expenses probably because she saw how her father\u2019s death affected her and would do anything for her mom not to have to hurt like that again. I\u2019m sure she knows her mother\u2019s behavior has changed since her father died. \n\nYour wife is down one parent and with only her mother left she holds her tight; even though she has to put up with her mother\u2019s cruel remarks. I mean that\u2019s her mom, and from what I gathered, was a different person before her husband died. \n\nThe death of a spouse, parent, or sibling are all the second most stressful experiences anyone can experience. The only thing more stressful is the death of a child. \n\nYour wife lost her dad and in a way she lost her mom too. It\u2019s almost easier to grieve the physical death of a loved one than the emotional/ relationship death of a loved one. In the second the person is still alive and walking around, but they are someone else you don\u2019t recognize. \n\nI imagine you wife holds on to the happy memories of her mother; so when she sees her she sees her mom and all the wonderful memories that she has with her. She might still hold out hope that if she keeps showing her mom how devoted she is to her that she\u2019ll become the mother she remembers. \n\nSo while it\u2019s easy for me to say you and your wife would probably be much happier without her in your lives, it\u2019s not so easy in action. I\u2019ve been there and sometimes I still find myself there. \n\nYour wife physically lost her dad and emotionally lost her mom. I can see why she is still holding on to her mom even though rationally it\u2019s just going to cause her more pain. Something in our nature wants us to hold out hope that the people we love will ultimately see the error of their ways and come running back. There\u2019s a term for this, \u201cThe Lost Cause Fallacy\u201d. It\u2019s essentially a married couple that\u2019s been together for as long as you\u2019ve known them. They come to parties together and meet up with other couples for drinks or dinner. They\u2019re together, but not really. They don\u2019t show affection for each other, or they don\u2019t talk about them as a part of their life. They are in a relationship that\u2019s lost all it\u2019s spark, but neither can find it within them to pull the plug and end the relationship. It\u2019s the thought that, \u201cwe\u2019ve been together for ten years, I can\u2019t just throw that away. I mean then what were those ten years for?\u201d People stay in relationships because they believe they have already invested so much time and energy into the relationship that they see the time spent as time lost; and so they stay. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole and of course your wife is definitely not the asshole. Your MiL\u2019s behavior is what I would call \u201casshole behavior\u201d. She may well indeed be an asshole and she may decide she likes her new \u201coutlook\u201d on life. She could very well be in a dark place trying to cope with the death of her husband. She could very well be \u201cacting out\u201d so to speak. She could be lashing out at everyone and anything that reminds her of her husband. She could be subconsciously getting your wife to \u201ctake care\u201d of her like her husband use to because she\u2019s scared. She could be looking to her daughter, the next person closest to her, to carry her emotional baggage because she\u2019s scared of how much it will hurt to face those emotions. Hell she might have shit for coping skills and just mentally regressed as a way of self preservation. \n\nI have seen grief do crazy unthinkable things to people I\u2019ve known my whole life. I\u2019ve seen people break with reality because the grief they felt was more than they could bear. I\u2019ve experienced grief that walled me away from everything and everyone I knew. Grief has a way of revealing things about our personalities we never thought we were capable of. \n\nI have my bachelors of science in psychology if that\u2019s not already obvious. My first year at a community college I had a professor that inspired my love and fascination of the way we think and how we interact with each other. He told our class before you marry anyone you need to see how they respond in three situations. \n\nOne, how do they respond to financial stress? It\u2019s only a matter of time and we\u2019ve all found ourselves in some kind of financial situation/ crisis. He told us we need to watch very carefully how this person responds in situations with money. \n\nSecondly, how do they respond when they are ill. Not just allergies or the common cold, but that will still tell you something. He stressed it was important to see how they behave when they are sick as a dog. Can barely get out of bed, running a fever, vomiting, diarrhea, the works. He said you will learn a lot about a person when they are ill and have to rely on others for help. \n\nThirdly and lastly, how do they respond to grief. He stressed how important this was because while financial stress comes and goes, the same with being ill, death is pretty permanent. Watch how they behave when dealing with one of our most complex and potentially dangerous emotions. Grief can show someone\u2019s strength of character or show their deepest depravities. He pointed out that in each one of those situations you now have a window into your future with this person, choose wisely.", "Your MIL is awful. My mom is a lot like this. She crashed multiple things I planned with my friends. I hated it but if I ever pushed back she treated me awfully. One year, I was going on a holiday with two friends, and my mom wanted to come.

If boundaries are never enforced, why would MIL respect them? \n\nIt's time to be a hard ass on MIL, it's hard but you and your wife need to present a united front on this. \n\nIf it doesn't work, no contact or limited contact is the way to go. \n\nEither way, it sounds like MIL is living in the house your wife owns and pays for? This needs to stop, serve eviction papers, make sure to get video and pics of the state of the house when she is served in case she wants to damage the property so you can take her to court.", "NTA\n\nDo you really want this mentally I\u2019ll person interacting with your children? Do want her to be a role model of normal to them?", "Yeah, we all want to watch!  (Looks for corn to pop\u2026..)", "Just like he wants a free house to live in? I think you might solve two problems by selling or finding renters for the house that MIL lives in.  It sounds like he wants a free ride and maybe would peace out if forced to contribute to rent etc.", "Bahahahhaahaa-NO!\n\nWhat an insane demand! Who was expected to pay for your wife to drag her mother's baggage around for the entire trip? If she wants her BF to go on holiday, she can take him herself! I actually had to re-read this, it sounded so insane I was sure I had misunderstood!\n\nHonestly, you said everything necessary at the end there:\n\n>MIL pulled the pin out the crazy grenade.\n\nTo Op's wife: Honey, you take that holiday with your friend. You have done absolutely nothing wrong, not a single thing! I am so sorry you have to deal with this childish woman.", "Wtaf she\u2019s not TA. Why in the world would she take this man on her vacation with her friend. Why doesn\u2019t your mom take him in a vacation?", "Info: why does your mil want him to go? Chaperone, or vacation?", "\u201cMIL pulled the pin out the crazy grenade.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\ude06\n\nThat. Is. Brilliant.\n\nAlso NTA.", "Time for your wife to send eviction papers to her mother, and to go NC.", "Nta. Honestly shper weird that she wants her boyfriend to go on a trip with her daugjter when they have no relationship. Gives me the ick. I think your wife needs to start the process of stopping payment on the house or evicting mil and gi nc. This relationship.sounds awful for her mental health", "NTA\n\n\nAlso, WTF\nWhy would your MIL's boyfriend want to join on a girl trip? Make no sense.", "MIL sounds seriously personality disordered and your wife is numb to it because it's what she grew up with. \n\nIt could be that her full bizarre behavior was mitigated by her husband, so it only became apparent when he died. (This happened w/my parents.) \n\nWhat she was asking for is beyond weird. I had to read this multiple times to understand for sure that MIL wants HER boyfriend to tag along with your wife/her daughter and a friend. This wouldn't be appropriate for lunch, let alone a vacation.", "Nta. Its weird hed want to go on a trip with your wife and her friend sans his gf. Also, why hasnt tour wife kicked her mother out of her house?", "MIL can take him on vacation or she can hire someone else to, using all the money she saves by living in your wife\u2019s home.\n\nThe unmitigated gall!! \n\nYour MIL sounds extremely manipulative. NTA", "This demand by Mom is one of the strangest things I\u2019ve ever heard.  Girls\u2019 trip with an unwanted older man?   WTH?  Time to let Mom know the home is going on the market and she needs to find a place to live.", "Man fuck Jeff, all my homies hate Jeff", "NTA and it\u2019s probably time to help mom find a home (as in assisted living) that she can afford on her own SS so that your family can move into your home and change the phone number. That woman is senile at best and probably flat out narcissistic.", "NTA - why is a 70 yr old trying to go on an early 30s girls trip?!? That\u2019s super creepy! You should be creeped out. Since y\u2019all own MIL\u2019s home, send her an eviction notice. Put the house up for rent or sell it, use it to make $$ not drain you. Go LC or NC w MIL until she gets her act together. No is a complete sentence!", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Yes, the whole point is to provoke and put her (OP's wife) in emotional turmoil.", "I understand it to some extent though--when you've been brought up by someone like that, your sense of what is normal gets incredibly warped. Like your wife, I've needed to have other people tell me that something is fucked up time and again. My fucked up radar is completely askew, although it is getting better and better.", "Please do! There is something wrong\u2014as in personality disorder\u2014with MIL. And your poor wife holds the trauma of being that woman\u2019s daughter. NTA, and good on her for being firm.", "Wife needs counselling to see how mommy dearest is impacting her life.", "Nta MIL is horrible and weird as heck for pushing her unwanted BF to her daughter. Let that sink in for a moment. Creepy and weird", "Your wife should read the book Adult children of emotionally immature parents. I'm sorry that you and your wife are in this situation", "Hey, that book saved my life too!!!! A+ recommendation. And omg, I am also nc with my mom, and I moved a continent away. \n\nOP, please, please, get your wife this book.", "Oh, it\u2019d be horrendous. You\u2019d definitely go viral.", "NTA.\n\nHave you and your wife discovered the r/JUSTNOMIL subreddit yet?", "How freaking weird is this ask?!? Hell no", "That\u2019s bizarre. NTA", "Ahh NTA OP your wife didn't even invite your MIL on the holiday. No way does MIL get to hijack her holiday.", "op(nor wife)=NTA\n\nThat is beyond bizarre, Why would wife take her mother's 70 yr old boyfriend on a \"girl's trip\"?What is you MIL's logic???\n\nETA--INFO:  Is BF living in home you and wife own/pay for?", "NTA. Time to draw up the eviction papers. You don\u2019t get to be an entitled, abusive beggar", "NTA", "NTA.  If wife was going on holiday with mother, I would understand mom wanting boyfriend to tag along.  The fact that wife is going on holiday with a friend, why on earth does some old man need to come with?  And if mom thinks daughter needs a male chaperone, she should be forcing OP to go on the holiday.  Even if wife is going on a holiday of something that is on mom's boyfriend's bucket list, it is still really weird.  I would only back this if boyfriend was a relative who is dying and this holiday is on their bucketlist.  OP wife is NTA.  She should kick mom out of house and go low contact.  Mom is unhinged.", "And it sounds like mom wasn\u2019t invited on this trip either\u2026so she wants to tag along on a trip that ain\u2019t hers, along with boyfriend?  Weird.", "I was wondering the same thing. What dude in his seventies wants to be set up by his gf to tag along on a friendcation with his gfs daughters friend, who he doesn't even necessarily know super well, and where his gf won't be present? WTF?", "Nta. Time to get MIL evicted, move into the house, start saving money and go NC. She's a narcissist and is using your wife's pain to manipulate her.\n\nIn what world is it acceptable to expect your wife to take MILs boyfriend with her on a trip?!! A trip that you aren't even going on...that MIL isn't even going on?! She talks about your wife being entitled? Me thinks she is projecting.\n\nUta very inappropriate behaviour, very creepy, and MIL sounds unhinged. Seriously, NC anf have her evicted. She can move in with her BF.", "NTA. Sounds like Mil wants the bf out of the house long enough for her to get all his suff out and get rid of him. Then when your wife return you will be stuck with him.", "NTA at all and I think it is time to kick MIL out of HER house and let her see what karma really is.", "Teenagers as well but yes mostly minors.\n\nIt's more the practicalities of it - not as easy to trap a self-sufficient adult who lives elsewhere.", "Borderline Personality Disorder is diagnosed when a patient meets 5 out of the 9 criteria laid out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\n\nThis allows for a wide range of variation among BPD patients. Not only can you have different combinations of those criteria, you must also account for the differences in the kinds of impulsivity patients exhibit. Add in the likelihood of having a co-morbid mental illness such as Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Anorexia, or Substance Abuse and you have even greater variation. We are the same \u2014 but also unique \u2014 in our experiences.\n\nI think it is also important to remember that BPD is a very serious illness and it\u2019s diagnosis should not be thrown around lightly. The immense stigma of the disease from not only the general public but some mental health practitioners makes it a difficult diagnosis to accept. It should be the result of a concerted diagnostic effort on the part of a mental health professional. It should not be delivered as an accusation from a stranger on the Internet."]}
