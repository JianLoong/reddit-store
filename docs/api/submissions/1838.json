Keep all documentation. \n\nThis mom is a complete psycho. I am the parent of a young adult and I cannot imagine getting involved in/with my kid\u2019s romantic life or attacking a (perceived) significant other following a breakup.

Absolutely go forward with legal actions and a protective order. This is kind of insane. \n\nWho knows why Jer lied the way he did.
