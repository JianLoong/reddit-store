I like being at home, alone, 40 hours a week. Even better when hubby is on site for work.", "It is also his girlfriends house, her wishes should be respected surely...", "Right? It's not like her home is unsuitable for dogs- she lives there. They absolutely don't need the backyard.", "And now he has to deal with cat pee in the bedroom. Eww.", "This I think is the bigger issue. The gf basically has washed her hands for her actions in this scenario. NTA", "I notice OP says I have, I have a feeling the cats are not hers so she could care less. I'm a dog person but I don't feel the right to bring any dog into someone else's home who has cats that have issues with dogs. Hell I would never bring my dogs to someone else's house unless they specifically asked me and there is no one else bothered by that.", "It's a seizure response dog. In public the dog stays at her feet but the dog is trained to sleep in her bed with her and sits on her furniture with her at home. The dog doesn't bother the cats, aside from the fact they don't make an appearance when the dog is there, my cats don't get along well with dogs at all. They react to the sight, smell, and sound of them. Vet trips are always a chore despite them being in their cat carriers.", "Apparently so because she needs her service dog and it'd be 'better for the cats to not live somewhere where a service dog routinely visits'. Sure she needs the dog and the assistance it provides but that doesn't mean I have to rearrange my home or my kitties to accommodate her.", "Their reasoning was that Carrie's apartment is too small, noisy neighbors next door and above, and easier on Carrie when it's time to walk the dog so she's not alone.", "It\u2019s not cruelty to say that you don\u2019t give a damn about someone\u2019s illness/disability when they\u2019re the ones weaponizing their illness and disability in defense of stomping on boundaries and compromises. What OP said was completely fair game after multiple attempts at kindly resolving the situation.", "Normally I would agree with you but this was not what I would call a small confrontation. He said that he had expressed concerns about this and offered solutions that took her feelings, needs, and disability into account. Obviously people's health is more important than cats. I, a cat lady, do understand that. But Carrie is an adult and it sounds like she can definitely take care of herself. He's not responsible for her health, she is, and he has offered accommodations. As a pet owner, he IS responsible for his cats' health. So, honestly, i don't blame him for putting his cats above a woman who just wanted everything exactly her own way.", "Nothing he said was hurtful or cruel. She doesn't get to decide what's non-negotiable in his home, he was simply telling her the truth - his cats are more important to him than she is. You can have sympathy for someone's disability, but you are not required to care enough to rearrange your whole life. Quite frankly, after she shot down every reasonable compromise and told him to re-home the cats she needed to be told that. She needs to understand that her disability does not make her needs more important to him.", "I did put her on the lease and I agree she gets a say who comes to the house but who she's wanting over is causing problems, which is why I offered up compromises and tried to talk to both of them first.", "To the extent that it seriously disturbs the other residents, ie, her bf and the cats? She was taking her friend's side over her bf's, when there were multiple other options available. The cats don't have other options. They're there all the time.", "She has epilepsy and it's a seizure response dog.", "It's a rental, she moved in with me and she got put on the lease when I renewed.", "Should I re-home my cats so they can hang out and hang out in my house more comfortably, there will be an arrangement.", "If a company can\u2019t figure out how much work I do from home then they definitely have 0 idea how much work I do in the office. Tons more time is wasted in office", "I did a lot more socializing when I was in the office than I do WFH.", "While I don\u2019t think OP is the AH - NTA, imagine asking someone *you don\u2019t even live with* to revoke their cats for you. WTF?!\n\nI disagree with you here. I have multiple disabilities, and ADHD. Because of my disabilities, wfh makes working full time more accessible to me. But because of my ADHD, I\u2019m much more productive when I have someone to body double with. So an ideal work day for me is wfh with a friend who also wfh, so we actually get work done but I don\u2019t have to commute or deal with accessibility issues.\n\nBody doubling is a huge productivity booster.", "People socialize a lot at the workplace. Hell, I get a lot more work done when I am home, even if I sometimes call a friend while I am at it. Workplace has always been the worst and most distracting place to me. And honestly, never have been in an office where people were working 100% of the time. More like a 60/40 ratio. I am so much more efficient at home, it is laughable when a boss wants me in.", "OP lives there. it's OPs **home**. whether or not it's their house is irrelevant. cos it's sure as hell not the in the cats names, but they've still *far more* right to that space than Carrie or her SD.", "Exactly", "Probably not even an actual service dog.", "I agree with another's comment here... Time to re-home the GF if she continues her behaviour of disrespecting your home.\n\nYou don't even need the cats as a reason, you don't want the dog over and what they do about that is up to them to problem solve. But this is your home too and people (and their dogs) visitors should need everyone who lives in the home to be comfortable with them being there.\n\nNTA.", "The part that isn\u2019t necessary is her working at your house. I don\u2019t know why she and your girlfriend think they\u2019re entitled to this or that it\u2019s in any way sustainable.", "Sounds like Carrie should rehome her and her dog to a house that\u2019s not too small with noisy neighbours and a backyard so that your girlfriend can visit her. Wild that someone dares to say that you should\u2019ve rehome your cats.", "This is all about what's best for Carrie. There are four other beings who *actually* live in that home, and all are better off without her making your place her new office and dog park (including your gf--I doubt that friendship is very healthy if Carrie is so comfortable making such demands). Unbelievable.", "looking for a convenient doggy toilet", "So, Carrie should move somewhere that isn't small, noisy, and has a yard for her dog then. Problem solved.", "NTA. Both people on the lease, both people should feel comfy with the others\u2019 guest. I find it absolutely nuts that gf\u2019s friend needs to come over every. single. day. Like how many days in a row x hours per day are we talking?\n\n*eta and she\u2019s saying rehome the cats at YOUR house?!? hell no. you gave gf mult reasonable options. this seems weird, like she is codependent with your gf. What if she didn\u2019t know your gf? Could she still not walk her dog or wfh at her own house? i\u2019m so annoyed for you lolol", "Understood. She cannot be separated from the dog. \n\nStill doesn't make you the AH here though. It's your home, it's where your cats live. \n\nShe needs to find a solution if she want to be over every day.", "Same here. You are so right.", "If it belongs to the GF, then OP should consider moving out.", "Was gonna say the same thing", "She's there 4-5 days in a row usually from 10-4, sometimes later.", ".. why?", "I kept reading the story, and I was like, why does this person--Carrie--get so much say in when they're there and how long? It not her home. \n\nYou and your cats were there first. Your gf is on the lease and does get a say, BUT both tenants need to be comfortable and agree on guests. Like who comes, when, how often, notice, etc. \n\nThis is affecting your pets, which LIVE at your home. Carries and her service dog are having a negative impact, and she didn't want to compromise with you IN YOUR HOME! WILD! \n\nYour gf... there are no two sides to this. Her friend was rude and disrespectful. Carrie tried to insert her authority in your home. She wanted you to rehome your cats. YOU, tried compromise. If your gf doesn't have a \"come to Jesus\" moment and see that, you need to side eye her. \n\nAfter this, I wouldn't want Carrie in the home again after the disrespect she showed without serious remorse, an apology, accountability, and her making changes.", "oh so a lil-part time tenant?? ughh kudos to you for standing up for yourself and your cats.", "because it's a bad environment for the cats.", "so why should OP have to/consider a move? what is making it impossible for OPs girlfriend to change the environment to something healthy for the cats? (spoiler; nothing bc girlfriend has literally changed the environment and the cats have free reign of the home again)", "To be fair though it wasn't the girlfriend who changed the environment. I'm not sure that was your main point but just wanted to point out OP was eventually the one to speak up to Carrie.", "If the GF is instransigent, then moving is the only option. But of course it may not come to that.", "okay, girlfriend has accepted the change of environment and not stood in the way of it happening. same difference.", "Okay, this is a genuine question, I'm not being sarcastic or anything else, I am simply baffled by your response here; Did you actually read the post?"]}
