Prior to this, her friend Carrie who also works from home would come over to our place a few times a month. Carrie has a service dog and I have two sibling cats who do not do well with dogs at all. When it was just a few times a month of Carrie coming for short visits I'd just take the cats and go into our bedroom to watch TV and they could cuddle up with me. Even then after Carrie would leave, the cats would poke their heads out of the room and be very cautious coming out, avoiding where Carrie's dog sat/lay down. My gf KNEW about this concern.\r  \n\r  \nThe issue that's come up is ever since my gf started wfh, Carrie comes over daily to do her own work which means her dog comes too. This has been going on for almost a month and my cats are suffering for it- they slink around if they do come out of any room, they're skittish when they eat, they avoid all the furniture and worst of all they were having accidents in the bedroom because they were too scared to leave. I moved the litterbox into our room but my gf complains about it. I tried to talk to my gf first and she said she'd talk to Carrie but she didn't, citing she felt bad because she knows Carrie needs her dog and didn't want to come off as uncaring. I offered up compromises like turning the spare bedroom or basement into an office for them. I suggested that my gf go over to Carrie's instead of Carrie coming to our place but they shot that down saying since we live in a duplex house with a bit of a backyard it was more convenient for Carrie to come to her and that way her dog can be taken outside for its needed exercise/play and Carrie has someone with her when she takes the dog out to relieve itself. Carrie has had an excuse to say no to everything.\r  \n\r  \nMonday I went into work late waiting on Carrie, when she got there I told them I'm done with the effect her dog's presence was having on my cats and they either needed to sit outside on our screened-in porch to do their work or she stops coming over every single day. Carrie said they needed to work together because they both got lonely during the day wfh and my gf was helping her out. Carrie got mad that I was putting cats above a human and her dog is non-negotiable and Carrie suggested I rehome the cats. I told her I couldn't care less about her health problems when it makes her presence a problem for my cats and they weren't going anywhere but she could. Carrie did leave after that and she hasn't been back since. I wouldn't say my gf has been cold or distant toward me, she says she sees both of our points but I was ultimately an asshole for telling Carrie she either had to sit outside with the dog or just not come over because it's a delicate situation.

Id be a hedge fund manager or a Senator or something", "NTA - a service dog performs important functions and there  are a lot of protections in place to make sure they can be with their handlers in public, that does not extend to someone\u2019s personal property. Carrie is the AH for not respecting your home, and frankly you GF is too for not putting the needs of her pets, who she is charged with the emotional and physical safety of, first. I\u2019m glad your kitties can feel safe again, you did right by them.\n\nEdit to say Carrie has a lot of nerve to suggest you rehome your cats to accommodate her. She does not sound like a good person to have around at all, so it is probably best she stays away.", "NTA\n\nYour GF can take her ass over to Carrie's.  This is your and your cats' home, too.", "NTA. how long were you with your gf? It honestly sounds like you might need a new gf. You aren't putting your cat above your gf. Doing that would genuinely make anyone TA, but that isn't what you are doing. You are prioritizing your cats health and well being over a minor inconvenience for your girlfriend, and your girlfriend doesn't care at all about your cats. Which is a huge red flag. (And this is coming from someone who doesn't really like cats all that much) \n\nI do think you need to put your foot down.", "NTA. Carrie has some nerve! Rehome your cats so she can wfh with your gf cuz she's lonely? No. She has options. Rehoming your cats is not one of them.", "NTA\n\nAnd your gf is wrong. There is nothing delicate about this situation. You don't have to allow dogs into your house. If Carrie wants to hang out with your GF, they can meet somewhere else", "NTA. Your cats deserve their safe space and if the dog is affecting them, youre right to prioritize them. Your GF and Carrie can go elsewhere, like to Carrie's house or a cafe where they wont disturb the cats.", "NTA your cats deserve to feel safe in their own home. You offered good compromises and they turned you down.", "NTA\n\nThe cats live there; the dog doesn't.\n\nCarrie does not have to be there. So goodbye dog.\n\nIf she eventually agrees to leave the dog on the porch, that will not work because she will cheat on the agreement. The dog will whine and bark and that will be her excuse.\n\nCarrie does not have to be there. Her dog does not have to be there. The very fact that she told you to rehome your cats to make life easier for herself tells you how selfish she is.", "NTA\n\nIt's your place. You can decide who comes and goes.", "NTA\n\nNTA in the slightest.\n\nYou have two cats who depend on you for care, you chose to adopt them which means you're obligated to give them the best life possible. You appear to be doing everything you can to both appease your GF and care for your animals. If your GF can't reciprocate, that's on her.", "NTA \n\nPretty simple one here. Dog can\u2019t come over anymore.", "NTA - that is your cats' home too. Plus she didn't NEED to work at your house - it sounds like she really just waned company. What does she do when she is home and has to take her dog out to exercise, play, do it's business .... she does it - there at home. So using the excuse that your yard is better is just that - an excuse. It's not uncaring to explain to Carrie that they need to work from her house - not the house where the cats live. Carrie should be able to handle that if she really cared. It's not a delicate situation... - just go to Carrie's place and everyone can be happy. Carrie continues to work from home like always - your gf goes over and works from there to be company to Carrie - and you and the cats can relax that their home isn't invaded by a dog that they can't understand why it is in their house.", "NTA\n\nYou put your foot down and she was still super resistant to it.  She doesn't get to take over your home and tell you to rehome your fucking pets because she's lonely!", "NTA. 100% easy NTA. Your cats come before a visitor\u2019s dog. If your girlfriend can\u2019t understand that maybe you should try rehoming her.", "Fuck Carrie for telling you to rehome your cats. NTA", "If Carrie needs someone near her when she's WFH, maybe it's time she just went into the office instead.", "NTA but I see this more as your gf's fault than Carrie's. Don't get me wrong Carrie sounds like an AH too and absolutely inappropriate to tell the host of the place you're a guest at to re-home their cats\n\nBut your gf is two-sidesing a problem she created and utterly ignoring not only your own feelings but also the lives of your cats. These are boundaries she should be setting, but by letting Carrie come over and not considering any alternatives even when you hit your breaking point she gets to keep her hands clean turning it into a disagreement bn you and Carrie and not you and her.\n\nThe tldr is your gf should care about you and your feelings and she should care enough about your cats to not make them suffer like this. It's a huge red flag that she doesn't, and an even bigger one how she handled the whole situation", "NTA,  but you should rehome your girlfriend i she bring Carrie and her dog over again.

They dont feel safe with Carries dog around its cruel to let the dog over regulary.", "NTA.\n\nI don't allow dogs of any flavor in my home because one of my cats is a dogfight-training-aid survivor.   Which means I took him away from people who were using him as a training aid for dogfighting.  So he's terrified of dogs and my FIRST DUTY is to his safety and comfort. \n\nStick to your guns, OP.  Your first duty is to your cats.  You have NO duty toward Carrie.", "Stress can cause severe and potentially fatal medical complications in cats. Sometimes, even minor environmental changes can be too much for some cats.\n \nYour gf and her friend are not wrong for wanting to work together. But they are, very realistically, risking your cats' lives.\n\nIf they are unwilling to compromise on staying in one room in the home, then the dog shouldn't be coming over.\n\nYou are NTA.
