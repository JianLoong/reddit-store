Where is the rest of the money supposed to come, when they need a loan even for the first payment? Unless of course one only needs a lump sum to get a loan, and then can proceed to pay monthly from salary.", "I can understand loaning money to family if its any kind of emergency, but this isn't one. Even then, I would say its dumb to expect them to pay it back.", "From everything I heard about the Chinese real estate market, it's one the worst things to invest in. People are making mortgage payments on houses that are in process of being built which can take months/years. It will boggle the mind.", "\"She gives up all her savings for him, she has nothing in the bank till he starts paying her back. \" .. So she is an AH making empty promises to get her husband to give her money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe pretended to be sure he would get his money back in the next 10 months, KNOWING that her brother had not even agreed to that payback plan and that SHE does not have the money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is just her manipiulating and guilting her husband with NO plan to pay him back.", "Oh wow I didn\u2019t read that much into it. I figured it\u2019s plausible the brother is scamming his sister.", "My brother loaned me over $40,000 for the downpayment for my house so that I wouldn't have to withdraw the money from my retirement and pay a penalty on top of the interest.\n\nI will pay him back in full this September when I will be old enough to withdraw the funds without any penalty.\n\nWe don't have anything in writing.  It's just how our family does things for each other.  I am so blessed.", "perfect post--agree 1000000%", "Agree except ANY loan made to a family member is really not a loan as you should never expect it to be paid back. If it is an emergency you are basically giving them money to help them out--not a loan but more of a bail out. If you get the money back you are damn lucky.", "I mean if wife had a emergency and needed th3 money brother probably couldn't immediately pay it back", "Sounds like you have a really loving and trusting family. I do too. I know that not everyone has that bond, and often for good reason. We are very lucky.", "And she does not have the money to pay her husband back, or she could lend that money to her brother directly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is a \"Give my brother money, you will NEVER get it back, so better your money than mine!\" request.", "OP did not say she does not have the money to pay it today.  In fact he said she is worried it would leave her reserves to low while OP has a larger cushion.\n\nShe even proposed a monthly installment plan and OP did not indicate she either would be unable or unwilling to make the payments on.\n\nOP is NTA for refusing the loan, but lets not start spinning fantasies about her motives, character, or intentions not present in the original post\n\nedit for missing word", "She may just be taking money out of her savings or an investment account if she were to do it herself, and the vast majority of the time you need a minimum balance for a higher interest rate and/or no fees. If she makes less she has less of a nest egg, and he could probably take 10k out of an account without it effecting any rates for him, where she might not have that luxury and is just asking her husband to avoid that. We dont really know the true reasoning behind it, plus she\u2019s already agreed to take full responsibility for the loan regardless of wether or not her brother pays her back. \n\nAt the end of the day its still his decision though.", ">She\u2019s. His. Wife.\n\nAnd if she doesn't pay him back, what's his recourse?", "Oh yeah, you appear to pay up front and if the property developer screws you, your recourse is go fuck yourself.  I've seen videos (so who knows how true) of local police basically red-flagging protestors in covid apps, so freezing travel, trying to get unfinished properties that they are paying the mortgage on finished.", "\"She even proposed a monthly installment plan and did not indicate she either would be unable or unwilling to make the payments on.\" .. She DID indicate that her brother has not agreed to the payment plan she pretended to promise to her husband.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo she does not have the 10K now, but will have them in a few months to give to her husband when no money from her brother comes? NOT really likely.   \nIf she made that kind of money, she would not need to borrow 10K from her huisband.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is EVIDENT that her brother has not agreed to the payback plan she falsely promised her husband. So her husband won't get the money back from him in the next 10 months. THAT much is clear. ANd he won't get it from her, too.", ">If I understood correctly, she IS taking on the financial risk herself.\n\nThe moment he hands over 10k to her to give to her brother he is risking the 10k. She is out nothing. \n\nYes she pinky promised to pay him back, but if she stops paying him back what is his recourse? The risk is all his.", "Did you not read the whole thing or something", ">he DID indicate that her brother has not agreed to the payment plan she pretended to promise to her husband.\n\nHer brother has no bearing on the payment plan.  SHE is paying her husband back.  The risk is on her not her husband if the brother doesn't pay her back\n\neta:  again OP has not given any indication in his post that he doubts her ability or wiliness to pay him back"]}
