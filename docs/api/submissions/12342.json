According to her, he has a good job.  IDK why he's asking her specifically here.", "Likely she could, it would be very uncomfortable for awhile while she was paying it back.  My concern is also for her though.  I'm genuinely scared that the he will not, and the rest of her family will pull the \"we're family\" line on her when he doesn't.", "You have issues dude.", "It's not a trust thing with my wife.  It's a trust issue with her brother and I don't want something like this to destroy her family dynamic if he suddenly decides not to repay.  I don't want to be put into a position where she comes back and says he's not paying back and then if I could \"forgive\" the loan to her.", "They are both taking risk from what I see. Despite how they have an agreement re: money, her money is literally his money too (if US, co-mingled).", "I suggested setting up an account just for this, and she could deposit into it until her brother needs it directly, and I would make the difference of the 10k but she doesn't want to do that either.", "The brother is shady. Who in their right mind would enter a crashing real estate market based on a big ponzi scheme. Also she doesn't get to be mad he doesn't want to lend the money. She already emotionally blackmailed OP before and would do it again if the brother doesn't pay back the money. Do not mix money and family.", "How in any way is this him supporting HER? Is she buying the house? Is the brother planning on making her co-owner of the house? Does she have any stake in it at all? No. She wants OP to support her BROTHER, not her. That\u2019s not his job. If she wants to do that she can but it\u2019s not OP\u2019s problem that BIL can\u2019t afford a down payment.", "Yeah that is my concern.  I offered alternatives but she didn't want to do it.  Hell, if the place he wanted was already built I'd be more amendable to it but it's a place that isn't even built yet.  I'm afraid that he won't pay it back, it'll hurt her relationship with her family, and she'll be mad.", "Yes how dare married people feel comfortable asking each other for help, right?", "If it\u2019s his money under their usual arrangement of finances and he gives it to her to lend out and then seek repayment, how is she taking all of the risk? She might not be able to pay it back either. It will also further strain their relationship, which is pretty stressed right now anyway.", "It's possible to trust somebody in some regards (trust them not to cheat, trust them to hold up their end of the chores, trust them to be responsible when looking after kids), but not trust them in other regards (trust them to not overestimate the willingness of their family to screw them over).", "No, but she is for getting angry when he asked questions and didn\u2019t immediately agree.", "Wife is an asshole for not spending her own money, or asking husband to go halves with her on the loan, meaning husband assumes All the financial risk of the loan.  \u201cWhen I asked why she wouldn't just loan him directly, she said it was because she wanted some buffer in her own finances\u201d", "I didn\u2019t say that? If you mean because I said I think he\u2019s NTA then my bad, NAH", "yeah, I'm thinking that too, but it's possible she just literally doesn't *have* the money all at once, so I need a lil clarity, lol", ">Is your wife financially capable of loaning him the money without your assistance?\n\nDoes she have the $10k in her account *to* give him all at once?", "If the brother didn\u2019t pay back the loan would you expect your wife to pay you back? \n\nIf the answer is no, then your wife is definitely TA.", "Hi OP, I come from an Asian background so I can provide some information that might help.\n\nIn China, it\u2019s not unheard of for families to prioritise helping their sons/brothers secure housing as most women see homes as a source of stability. (https://amp.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3201264/my-wedding-can-wait-big-sister-works-hard-saves-buys-flat-and-car-brother-boost-his-marriage-chances)\n\nThis might be patriarchy at play, but I don\u2019t know the family dynamics of your wife and her family so she might be either obligated to, or pressured by her parents to help out", "It would matter to me. If not loaning the money would have serious consequences it\u2019s different than if it\u2019s just convenient to loan the money.", "I think if she would be pretty financially stretched then youre entitled to refuse, because her being broke is gonna end up knocking on to you.\n\nNta", "Women need drama in life. You got to make them so that you can close them on your terms. Else you get walked/ talked over all life. One of the toughest lessons one learns quite late into one's life. Yes I have issues and I love those issues.", ">It's a trust issue with her brother\n\nBut you are not lending the money to her brother. You are lending it to her. She made it clear that whether or not he pays back, you'll get your money.\n\n>I don't want something like this to destroy her family dynamic\n\nThat's not your decision to make. Your wife is her own person, and she is an adult that can decide how she wants to handle the relationship with her own family. It's not your place to decide for her.\n\n>I don't want to be put into a position where she comes back and says he's not paying back and then if I could \"forgive\" the loan to her.\n\nSo, in other words, you don't trust she will repay you.", ">we have a joint account for bills but don't really mix finances\n\nThey both have their own money. They don't mix finances. It's a pretty common way of doing things.", "Does this make sense to you? Have you heard anything about this from the brother? Are you sure the money would be going to him for property, or to him at all? I find this confusing.", "I completely agree with you on the theory, and I said so. No way I would have done this, but I also don\u2019t have separate finances; my spouse and I make our decisions together. \n\nMy point is that OP and his wife set it up where HE doesn\u2019t get a say. He only gets a say on the loan, and if I was his wife, I would be hurt that he doesn\u2019t trust me to return the money. He doesn\u2019t get a say in what wife wants to do with it since she\u2019s paying him back regardless, and they have separate finances. My point is still valid. I agree that the entire deal is stupid, but it\u2019s his wife\u2019s mistake to make. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t much matter here; he said no to the loan.", "And she can be mad for whatever stupid reason she wants to. No one gets to control my feelings. They only get a say in the actions that result from my feelings.", "She's taking on the debt - it's between husband and wife. What she does with the money is her responsibility, she's committed to repaying it so he shouldn't interfere.", "Not my plight, I\u2019m just not ever comfortable asking people for money they don\u2019t owe me, regardless of the relationship.  Circumstances differ of course but this imo isn\u2019t one I\u2019d consider.", "Well I for one trust my wife when she promises things, if he doesn't it's a weird relationship in the first place.", "The brother is irrelevant. It's his wife asking for the loan,which shows op doesn't trust his wife.", "I'd be pissed too if my wife told me she doesn't trust me.", "Which is a valid reason. I for one love my wife, ask her for help if I need it, and she does the same. I also trust my wife, so if she told me she'd pay it back, that's good enough for me.", "I thought she said she could, but more info would be great..  \n.", "Yes and I understand that completely but at the same time, my wife is in another country, they aren't really that close, and it's not for a complete house.  It's for a \"promise\" of an apartment/condo that isn't even built yet.  It also could open the doors to her other family members suddenly hitting her up for money.", "So how much Andrew Tate et al do you listen to/watch?", "Let's be realistic, if the brother doesnt pay back. Her paying OP back will be a strain on their relationship or she will emotionally blackmail him again to not pay him back. \nThe brother is being shady as well. China is in a severe economic crisis right now and no one in their right mind would enter the real estate market over their since it's basically a big ponzi scheme that has just crashed. She is being too trustful of the brother.", "I'd say your spouse's plight is inherently your plight, that kind of what being married means. It's your wife, not your roommate.", "Do you trust your wife's brother in China?", "He doesn't trust his wife on matters related to her brother, but he might trust her in most other areas of life.", "Would you be pissed if your wife said she didn't trust your deadbeat brother?", "Is it her that he doesn't trust, or the brother? I don't know; it's just tricky. I think that if he did give the money to her to give to her brother, they'd be much better off if it was just a gift, not a loan between them, and I don't blame him for not wanting to gift her brother. A loan between spouses seems pretty fraught.", "Some people have life experiences outside the internet. Independent of what we believe reality is.", "Who is that?", "Again... it's all about not trusting the wife to handle it.", "Irrelevant. He has no business with the brother whatsoever.  It's a loan to his wife, and she promises to pay it back. If he'd trust her that would be enough. What the money is for doesn't really matter.", "The brother has nothing to do with anything.", "Irrelevant. It's a loan to his wife, not to the brother. She's the one who promises to pay it back. I trust my wife, so for me that would be enough.", "I'd say the brother is irrelevant. His wife wants to loan the money and promises to pay it back. If he'd trust her that would be enough.", "She already emotionally blackmailed him. Not trusting her doesnt make him the ah.", "He does. Because the loan is for his benefit.", ">She already emotionally blackmailed him\n\nWhen ?!"]}
