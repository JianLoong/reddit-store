It's not something I'm proud of, but in many parts of my country, the big sister is expected to help the little brother buy a condo. Of course, parents' savings go to the little brother as well.\n\nBecause you two live in the other side of the world, and you are a 'rich American', I won't be surprised if the loan ends up becoming a 'gift'. Parents will probably pressure your wife to do so. \n\nAlso, the likelihood that the new construction never finishes and you all spend millions of RMB on nothing.\n\nIf your wife can afford to *gift* her brother a certain amount, go ahead (but I still don't think she should do that). But it's wrong to pressure you to do the same. \n\nYour wife only has obligations for her parents, nor her little brother. That's the part of my culture I despise deeply and will do everything in my power to discourage people from following it.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t mix money then you\u2019re really the one making the loan. You get to decide. Even if you did mix money you\u2019d make decisions jointly. If you\u2019re not comfortable with it don\u2019t do it.", "its not a loan to the wife if she is giving it to her brother", "NTA\n\nAll sounds as if you aren't going to be paid back and there's not really any intention to take it seriously as a loan. There's nothing wrong with just gifting money to someone to help them out, but a loan is complicated.\n\nIf she's not talking about it any more then let it go lol", "Don't loan money. NTA", "NTA, if she's so adamant he'll pay it back them she can make the loan instead of asking you to take the risk! Clearly she's manipulating you in order to get you to part with money she wouldn't and very likely won't care enough to actually satisfy the loan if her brother defaults.", "NTA.  If she wants to lend her brother money she can use her own.", "NTA. Never lend money to relatives. And I\u2019m not talking about your wife. I\u2019m talking about your BIL. Yes, I realize technically your wife would be lending it to him, but still. Big fat no from me.", "NTA, and 10k isn\u2019t hard to get approved for even for a personal loan let alone a home loan and even with bank interest, is well under 1k a month", "Nta\n\n This money never is going to be paid back.  Wife knows it., if wife is paying back 10k in 10 months, she also knows she'll either be paying for the rest of the house to be completed and finished. It is a case of her family milking her situation. \n\nJust say no.", ">If wife insists, fuck it, get a lawyer, draw up a contract with a payment plan and go for it.\n\nThat's a terrible idea. OP should just flatly refuse to loan any money whatsoever. If she insists that she needs to borrow money, she can get a personal loan from a bank or credit union.", ">Ship has probably sailed now but you could always setup a contract for it.\n\nThat's a terrible idea, if she really insists that she needs a loan to ~~donate~~ loan her brother $10k, she can get a personal loan from a bank or credit union.", ">You're loaning your wife money as if she's a stranger.\n\nNo, read the post again. The entire point at issue here is that he's not going to loan money to his wife.\n\nAs you say, they don't mix finances, if his wife had a cultural/family obligation to loan money to her brother, that's on her, not OP. She is free to loan her brother $10k if she chooses to, but that should come from her money. If she doesn't have the that much and still wants to fulfill her family obligation, she can get a personal loan from a bank. She can get a loan from a stranger.", "If OPs wife wants to loan her brother money, she is free to do so. What she can't do is demand that OP loan her money.\n\nOP already had very solid grounds for saying no to family members asking for money. It's common knowledge that loaning money to family is an extremely bad idea, as it's very likely that it will never get paid back. OP doesn't need to learn this lesson the hard way, he's already learned the lesson from other people's mistakes. He doesn't need to burn himself on the stove to know it's hot, he's seen other people burn themselves and learned the lesson without burning his hands.\n\n>Worst case scenario, she learns an object lesson on why it's risky to loan money to family members.\n\nNo, worst case scenario is that she doesn't learn that lesson. That she gets pressured by her family to forgive the debt to her brother and then she pressures OP to forgive her debt to him. She will have lost nothing, while OP will be out $10k. OP will have \"learned his lesson\", but wife wouldn't. If she was loaning out her own money, then it would be her lesson to learn.", "It doesn't matter if she promised to pay him back, OP is under no obligation to loan her any money. If their finances are separate, then it's on her to come up with the $10k she wants to ~~donate~~ loan to her brother. She doesn't get to demand that OP loan her the money.\n\nIf she's so confident that she's going to pay it back no matter what, she can get a personal loan from a bank or credit union.\n\nNo one is ever an AH for refusing to loan someone money. If OP wants to keep his money, that's his right, and is the smart thing to do here.", ">You need to apologize for that and make it clear where you stand. You got what you wanted ....her not to help out her family....but at what cost OP??\n\nOP has done absolutely nothing to stop her from helping her family, he's just not going to fork over $10k because she wants him to. If she wants to loan her own money to her brother, she is free to do so.", "He's not telling her how to manage her finances, he's yelling her how he manages his finances. If she wants to loan her brother $10k, she is free to do so. If she doesn't have $10k to loan out, then she can get a personal loan from a bank.\n\nOP is just refusing to loan out $10k of his own money.", "There's a massive difference between trusting your wife to be a good wife and a good person and trusting her to pay back money she doesn't have. Banks don't loan people money based on how much they trust their character, they loan money based on how much they trust someone to pay them back. Two very different kinds of trust.\n\nI would trust my sister to decide whether or not to pull the plug on my live support if I was critically injured. I literally trust her with my life. But I know my sister's financial habits and wouldn't trust her to pay me back even $500 if I loaned it to her.", "If his wife wants to loan money to her brother, that's her choice. She doesn't get to demand that OP loan her money. It's his choice whether or not to loan money, and he's decided no, he's well within his rights to decide no.\n\nOP is not an asshole for not wanting to loan $10k of his own money. If his wife really wants an extra $10k so she can ~~donate~~ loan it to her brother, she can get a personal loan from a bank or credit union.", "OP does not need to loan his wife any money. If she wants to loan money to her brother, she is free to do so, but she doesn't get to demand that OP loan money to her.", "If his wife wants to loan her brother money, she is free to do so. If she can't afford it right away and needs to borrow money herself to be able to loan money to her brother, she can get a personal loan from a bank.\n\nIf OP wants his money, he should just keep it, not just give it away and hope it gets repaid.\n\n>So, in other words, you don't trust she will repay you.\n\nYes. That's perfectly fair. There's a massive difference between trusting your wife to be a good partner and trusting her to pay back a $10k loan she can't afford. Paying that money back isn't just a matter of her choosing to do the right thing, she has to actually have the money to pay back. Banks loan money to people they trust to pay them back, not people they trust to be good people, it's a very different kind of trust."]}
