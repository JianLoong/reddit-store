Me and Julie get on fine, but she was very upset by her parents' divorce  and I was away at boarding school so we never really became close, but there\u2019s no bad blood between us.\n\nAlmost a year ago now, Julie started dating Max (26M). Max is from a wealthy family, and his mother Vera has never liked Julie. Julie has described Vera as very snobbish and passive aggressive, and said she often makes disparaging comments about her to Max (\"you could do better\" \"are you sure about her\" \"don't rush into anything\"). However, she and Max are getting closer and she decided to invite his parents and him to our parents' home, partly to prove we are of equal social standing, in the hopes that Vera would warm to her. Julie begged us several times to all be on our best behaviour and help her endear herself to Vera and we all agreed.\n\nWhen Max and his parents arrived, Vera complimented my necklace, and this led on to a conversation about jewellery and other common interests. She learned that Max and I briefly worked at the same company, and that I attended boarding school with his cousin (we only found both things out after Julie and Max started dating). I could see that Julie was upset that Vera took a liking to me but I was worried if I cut the conversation that would reflect badly on Julie and that perhaps this was a sign Vera was opening up to our family. \n\nAt lunch we were talking about travel and where we planned to go next year. I said I would be attending a formula 1 race next year. Vera was very enthusiastic about this since she and Max and his dad all love F1. I made a comment that made her laugh and she said \u201csee Max this is the one you should be dating\u201d. The table went silent and I could see Max was embarrassed, so I just jokingly said I was off the market anyway. I think Vera could see she\u2019d gone too far and the conversation moved on. Nothing else like that happened except when they were leaving Vera asked for my number to \u201ckeep in touch\u201d. I gave it to her because it seemed like it would have been rude and embarrassing to Julie to refuse, even if we never talk again. \n\nWhen they were gone, Julie laid into me, saying I shouldn\u2019t have monopolised Vera and not allowed her to faun over me. She said she was tired of always being in my shadow, which I never thought she had been and didn\u2019t know she felt that way. I apologised and said I really thought I was helping Vera see our family and by extension Julie, in the right light and doing what she asked by being agreeable. Julie has been very cold to everyone in the house for the past few days, and my mum is now saying that maybe I should have redirected Vera to Julie\u2019s strengths rather than let Vera lead the conversation the whole time. I feel terrible that I may have jeopardised Julie\u2019s relationship with Vera, but I\u2019m not sure what I could have done differently, so aita?", "created_utc": 1671380386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp262c/aita_for_being_too_friendly_to_my_stepsisters_mil/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were polite and friendly and shared common interests. You did what you thought was best.", "So I\u2019m going to say NTA, but Vera was most likely using you as a way to put your step sis down. I doubt she was actually sincere in her compliments and fawning over you. You should apologize to your step sis and say that was not your intention. Tell her that you just wanted to put the family in a positive light and that you will back off if she feels uncomfortable.", "NTA and your stepsister needs to grow up. She was literally trying to use you to increase her social standing with MIL and you did what you were asked to do in order to help her to do that. It's not your fault that the MIL is an AH. All you did was be yourself and try to do her a favor. If your stepsister has a problem with that, maybe she shouldn't be in your life.", "Honestly, NTA from my perspective. Seem\u2019s your sister thinks she\u2019s a shadow because you have similar interests that they all do. It\u2019s not your fault that you spoke the truth when they asked what your plans were. Sister needs to lighten up.", "Soft YTA because you recognize the fawning behavior (but miss who is fawning, it was you fawning towards Vera) but not how you are being used as a pawn in triangulation. Not shutting that down is participation and that house of cards being built by the triangulation will fall on you, the person being treated as the golden child. \n\nThe scapegoat, your stepsister, she gets hurt by it but she escapes.", "NTA\nVera sounds like the kind of person who doesnt give a shit. Even if you had tried to steer the conversation to julie, she would have dismissed it and brought it back to you.\nAnd you had common interests.\n\nJulie doesnt need to have a good relationship as long as she and max are happy.", "NTA. There\u2019s something about being effortlessly charming and that\u2019s what you have. Your step sister is trying to force it and it\u2019ll never work. You did your part and helped her show your family is no less than his fianc\u00e9e. After that, she\u2019s fucked.", "Nta. You're either playing the long game or you & Vera actually have a lot in common. You definitely have her trust & that could help defuse tensions or disagreements between the too.\n\nIn addition to say you were off the market, you could've taken time to talk up Julie & Max's relationship & how you could never compete with such a bond... but hindsight is 2020.\n\nJulie is insecure & it shows. She'll either get over it or she'll never have a tromg relationship with her MIL & dare i say, fianc\u00e9", "NAH (except MIL). I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for how you responded to Julie\u2019s MIL because it sounds like you truly were trying to help. However, it does sound like you could have handled it better. Casually redirecting the conversation to Julie\u2019s strength would have been a really good thing to do. Instead of saying you were off the market, you should have stated that Max found an amazing woman in Julie. Also, it\u2019s likely that MIL doesn\u2019t actually like you, rather she just used you to get at Julie. By going along with it you played into passive aggressive game MIL is playing with Julie.", "NTA\n\nYou were asked to be nice, you were nice so whatever issues your stepsister has with her new mil or you are her own. Given that you didn't purposely tried to overshadow your sister I don't know why she's blaming you now for her mil not liking her since that's a problem she's had BEFORE you 2 met.\n\n\nSide note: but is it possible that your stepsister had done something to her mil that she disliked? Maybe not even intentional but since you two are from the same family I don't understand why she's capable of being pleasant with you but not her. Or do you two have a very distinct difference in your upbringing, personalities and status? It wasn't made clear by the post", "NTA  But agree with her about her concerns and promise to do better.  You can apologize even when you're NTA.", "NTA, but you might have gotten played by a narcissist. \n\nI was raised by one and a common tactic is to use another person to control other people.  So, the MIL might very well be using you to stab your step-sister.  Be wary of that because she can very well turn on you as soon as she doesn't need you anymore.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think Vera purposely took an extreme interest in you, and said what she said, to needle your step-sister and try to provoke her. She wanted to cause your step-sister more pain, and she likely knows that there are some tensions around the divorce and blending of families. Unless Max is an absolute gem, who consistently puts his mother in her place, I foresee nothing but \u201cMIL\u201d problems for your step-sister. If I were her, I would be assessing my relationship. Is Max worth it?", "This OP is in delusion that Verra likes her more than Julie. She was just used by this lady to create discomfort into the heart of her son\u2019s gf whom she doesn\u2019t approve! I remember my mother in law commenting in front of all relatives that my sister looks better than me while looking at our wedding photo because she never liked me.", "NTA I understand how Julie feels. She really must have feel like in your shadow. Don't know about rest of your lives but now for sure she felt that way. But it was not your fault. If it was someone's it was partially Vera's, for only taking with you and not Julie, but on the other hand she know Julie and doesn't like her so why talk to her when there are other people. And someone with similar interest with whom she kinda clicked. And partially Julie's. If she wanted it to be a our her, which she of course wanted (I don't mean it badly, of course she wants her bf's mom to focus mainly on her) well she should have been trying to change the conversations. For example that she would love to travel somewhere with Max and Vera as well, that it would be wonderful. And then ask Vera. Vera, where would you recommend us to go? She had opportunities, but I also get that she maybe was afraid of interrupting her or your conversation cause that would be rude.\n\nHowever all that said, you should have tried talk about Julie. It's like an unwritten rule. If it doesn't work, that not on you. The fact of trying is what counts.", "Soft YTA. Vera is the HUGE AH but you allowed her to lead you by the nose as a pawn to hurt your sister. You\u2019re young, so I understand that this might have gone over your head, but your mom was right in that you could\u2019ve redirected the conversation to include Julie \u2014 which was the whole point of the meal anyway. Apologize to Julie, explain you didn\u2019t mean it and then get coaching from her and your mom about how you should navigate this going forward. Don\u2019t let Vera turn you into a weapon, she\u2019ll be making a fool of you too.", "NTA, Vera sounds like a nightmare. You're a bit of an A for not making a more solid statement against the over top comment she made, and you're a bit of an A for giving her your number instead of telling her to reach out to you through Julie.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA. Julie asked you to be on your best behaviour and you were. You didn't do anything inappropriate. You just did what you thought would help improve your stepsister's relationship with her MIL. Your stepsister is just insecure. If she gets her head on straight she will get over it. Or she won't, but it won't be your fault.", "NTA.", "NTA. If you didn't get on with MIL, you'd have been in the wrong in Julie's eyes. (If) You did, you're in the wrong once again. There is no winning for you here. Try to keep your distance next time, if you want to.", "NTA 'she decided to invite his parents and him to our parents' home, partly to prove we are of equal social standing, in the hopes that Vera would warm to her. Julie begged us several times to all be on our best behaviour and help her endear herself to Vera and we all agreed.'\n\nYou did exactly what she wanted. Seems to be a cause of be careful what you wish for.", "N T A. I've known a few women in my life with personalities like Vera. Redirecting or even changing the subject can be difficult because they know what you're trying to do. They can be vain and snobbish but also smarter than people give them credit for. \n\nIt may be possible for you to play up Julie's qualities in the future in you're so inclined. That particular dinner wasn't going to happen though.", "NTA I am inclined to agree with Vera lol.", "It's probably a control thing: some mothers feel threatened when their sons start focusing on another woman because *they* feel that they should be the most important woman in his life. Therefore, they are predisposed to dislike the girlfriend, no matter how wonderful she is. Every time Max decided to go out with Julie instead of whatever his mother wanted him to do counts as a black mark against Julie, even though that's objectively unreasonable.\n\nBut with OP, MIL got to meet her without feeling threatened. So she was open enough to connect over similar interests. Once they connected, MIL perceives OP as being \"just like me\" and since on some level, MIL believes that she is the only woman good enough for her little boy, she perceives OP as being a good match for him.", "I never said I thought Vera liked me in any genuine way, just that she was acting like she did.

But the DILs that aren\u2019t just get ostracised.", "Ignore this person, they're projecting their past situation onto your present one because of the similarities.", "Then I think you should talk to your stepsister once she cools down and reassure her that you were only trying your best to make her look good by being polite, and maybe dig deeper into her feeling overshadowed by you. I just think she needs support", "NTA.  Julie needs to grow a spine. Stop showing how insecure she is. Max fell for her something she seems to forget. Vera may not care for her. Max is the only one she needs to worry about.", "NTA\n\nEasy to see why Vera doesn't like her. Julie has probably said some really dumb things in Vera's company before.", "You are NTA but Vera is - she was using you to humiliate Julie. Julie's blaming the wrong person but I can understand her being upset. \n\nInfo: out of interest, why did you go to boarding school but Julie didn't?", "NTA, Seems like Julie can't be satisfied by any interaction that includes her MIL. \n\nIt's very unusual that the MIL is only the one contributing to a bad relationship anyway. There's input and bad behavior on both sides.", "NTA You shut her down when when she crossed a line. You did nothing wrong.", "Oh, my gosh, you're Rarity, and your stepsister is Sweetie Belle! \"Yeah, good, not jaw dropping amazing!\"", "You didn\u2019t read in the post that OP APOLOGIZED and told stepsister almost exactly what you\u2019re suggesting?", "You saw Mrs. Ferrars and Lucy Steele, too, huh? Now Lucy would have been over the moon to hear Mrs. Ferrars say she should've been Edward's fiance lol. OP did not and shut it down stat.", "I was already enrolled when our parents met and got married. My bio dad paid for my education.", "I did read the post. Doing it again after the emotions are gone is going to help.", "Sometimes people are hilarious with how completely socially oblivious they are. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you act like a socially inept troll?\u201d", "I mean, not your fault, but I can see why Julie may feel in your shadow. Do you also have a better job/more money that allows you to go to things like F1? \n\nBf's mum is hung up on material things and appearances and it sounds like you probably score higher in those than Julie.", "I don\u2019t work anymore, but yes I\u2019m fortunate enough to have access to things that a lot of people don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t really think it would matter since my stepdad is also very comfortable, it\u2019s not like Julie comes from a wildly different socioeconomic bracket.", "It probably matters more now because Julie is dating someone whose mother is so superficial and values people by this stuff. Again, not your fault, but maybe gives an insight into how this feels for Julie - I imagine being brought up with a stepsister who has access to a lot of things you don't is a challenge, but she's a deep enough person to have got over that and knows other things are more important. Suddenly someone who's approval she really wants comes along who judges on those things, it will bring any old feelings of comparative inadequacy to the fore."]}
