I am a 29F, husband is 34M. This is our first child. \n\nI spent Thanksgiving and Christmas with my husband's parents and family. I love them. They are overall great people. \n\nOne of my sister in laws, (husbands brothers wife)  has been treating me poorly for months. And I honestly have no idea why. She is rude. Has snippy comments towards me. And even when I go out of my way to talk to her, she gives me dirty looks and one word responses. I have been RACKING my brain to try and figure out what I did to upset her. I even did a blanket apology saying if I did something to upset her, I was sorry. That I would never do anything intentionally to upset her. And she said okay. This was Thanksgiving.  \n\nWell. Christmas party happened. She is there. Again, rude and passive-aggressive towards me. Whenever I try to talk to someone, she talks over me. It is rough. They left the party early, and I was crying to my father in law asking if he knew what I did wrong to make her so upset. EVERYONE jumps in saying how she is upset that I am pregnant and she is not. Her and her husband have a 6 year old girl and have been trying to get pregnant since. My husband and I had been married for one year in April of this year, and that is when we started trying, and we got pregnant in June. She has been mad since then. I just didn't see her in person until recently because I badly broke my leg and had surgery and was home bound for months. \n\nShe has been complaining to EVERYONE how mad she is at me for being pregnant.  And how it is supposed to be her turn. Well, funny, not so funny side note. My other sister in law (husbands other brothers wife), who I love and adore so much. She gave birth in March of this year. And apparently, toxic sister in law was mad at her the entire time she was pregnant, too. And jealous and bad mouthed her. But now that baby is here. Toxic sister in law wants to hold the baby and has become buddy buddy with amazing sister in law. \n\nAnd I heard all of this, and my blood boiled.  And I immediately said. I can't wait for a toxic sister in law to ask to hold my son. Because I want to see the look on her face when I say no. She is NOT going to treat me like crap my entire pregnancy and then get to enjoy time with my child. It's not happening. \n\nMy husband 100% agrees with me. As does my mom, who is going to be in the delivery room with me. I am just worried that my mother in law is going to somehow let toxic sister in law see and hold my son... and I do not want that. \n\nSidenote. I have been wanting to be a mom my entire life. And I know that infertility is hard. And just because I luckily have not struggled with that, I have struggled with years of having Mothers Day roll around it not being my turn. But I don't think that gives her a right to treat me this way. \n\nSo am I the A-hole for not wanting her to hold my son? And possibly have her act like nothing happened?", "created_utc": 1672081889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvubyy/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sil_to_hold_my_son_once/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being pregnant isn't something you \"take turns\" with. Yes, infertility is hard (I have been married almost 14 years with no children) but treating others badly because of it is a crappy and toxic thing to do. Hold your head up and know that you did nothing wrong. Also... You should get to choose the people *you* want to be around your baby.", "NTA, she is toxic and you need to keep this child away from her", "NTA I\u2019m a firm believer that if you don\u2019t respect the parents then you shouldn\u2019t have access to the kid", "NTA. I would stop hanging out with her and avoid at all costs.", "NTA and let the hospital know she is not welcome and they won\u2019t let her near the child.", "NTA.  Your DH should meet with his brother privately and suggest getting her help. And to explain to him why the baby will be NC indefinitely with her.  Protect your LO at all costs. If mil tries to intervene, have a plan ready w DH.", "NTA. Eff that mess. People haven\u2019t called her toxic ass out or defended you so, she can GTF outta here with her nonsense. \n\nShe clearly needs therapy.", "Stand your ground and be like no. Fuck her feelings.", "NTA. Her behavior is unacceptable. Is your plan a bit petty? Yeah, but she needs to understand that she cannot act that way and then pretend nothing ever happened as soon as the baby is born. She fucked around, she's gonna find out.", "NTA. If you cannot trust MIL, don't let her unsupervised with your child.", "NTA. You SIL doesn\u2019t need more kids until she gets a therapy!", "NTA.   You know, people used to get upset when they couldn\u2019t get pregnant but they didn\u2019t get toxic. This behavior is so beyond comprehension.  I wouldn\u2019t try to talk to her at all and turnabout is fair play, so feel free to ignore and walk away from her after you have the baby.", "NTA. She has her own problems but treating someone else so rudely is infantile. Hurting someone else because you're hurting is unacceptable. I think you would be in the right to distance yourself and your baby. Not to hurt her back, but because her bad behavior and negative energy affected you during your pregnancy. Her actions have consequences, and that consequence is that you are not going to play happy families with her. \n\nIn response to the inevitable demands for you to 'let it go', 'be the bigger person', because 'now you're doing the same thing,' you can say 'I am not being rude or cruel like she was. I will be polite. But her behavior during my pregnancy was painful to me and now I am uncomfortable with her holding my baby. I'm sorry she has struggles but her choices hurt me and my feelings are not a lower priority than hers.'", "NTA The moment I started reading I thought her issue was jealousy. I wouldn't let a jealous woman hold my baby. They are not safe.", "NTA. It is your baby, you decide who gets to hold them, end of story.\n\nI feel for your SIL, but she is an adult, and should act like one. Right now she's acting as if Santa brought you a toy she personally wanted while all she got was socks. I'd personally be worried that her jealousy and anger might go beyond just being passive aggressive and snippy with you once your baby is born.", "Why the heck hasn't the family confronted her about this, esp when she's done it before?  NTA\n\nEdit: I think you need to be done seeing or interacting with her for the rest of the pregnancy.  And for gods sake, don't have her at your shower, she'll just ruin it for you.", "NTA at all, but I wouldn't bring up \"struggling\" each Mother's Day. That's a serious kick in the face to someone who is having fertility issues when you are pregnant and weren't trying before.", "NTA. You gotta put your kid first, but be prepared for the fallout with your in-laws. It's not going to be easy to enforce and there will be hurt feelings. This sub is full of people ready to watch the world burn and they either forget or just don't care that the posters have to actually live with the consequences.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s been shitty to you and so you have revoked her privileges with your son at least temporarily. It happens, maybe she will realize her error and apologize to you unprompted. Your family is right, you\u2019re well within reason to do this.", "NTA - Your SIL needs to go to therapy", "NTA at all. Congratulations on the baby and I\u2019d feel exactly the same. I\u2019d be more sympathetic towards SIL if she was childless and was really struggling with your pregnancy, but she\u2019s not. She\u2019s ruining your experience and that\u2019s completely out of order. Enjoy the new born snuggles \ud83e\udd70", "NTA, but she really needs some therapy to deal with this. I would not withhold your baby from her long term, but definitely set appropriate boundaries. Infertility messes with your brain. You become less rational about other people being pregnant. Some people are still happy for you, but it can still be extremely painful and upsetting for themselves. She still is totally TA, but the entire situation sucks. \ud83d\ude1e", "ESH. Sister in laws behavior is unacceptable. Taking her resentment and grief out on you because she hasn't been able to get pregnant again is unfair. It's your baby so you are allowed to decide who is around your child. I would understand you not wanting Sister in law not around your child because you thought she was harmful to your baby, but the fact that you can't wait to see the look on her face when you tell her she can't hold your baby seems just a gross as her behavour. You are matching her cruelty with your own. I truely would have said NTA if  you had just said she was toxic and you didn't think that it was good for your baby. But the statement of wanting to see the look on someone's face when you know you are going to do something hurtful to them. That is matcing cruelty with cruelty in my opinion. I'm sure I will get voted down for my thoughts", "NTA but...don't change into TA.\nBattling her won't do any good.  \n\nMake sure that you're always the bigger person.  You'll be glad you were.", "ESH. She\u2019s obviously struggling and taking it out on you and previously your other SIL which isn\u2019t acceptable but have you tried to break the cycle and explain consequences to her?\n\nIt would make all of your lives easier now if she understands the repercussions ASAP and would, hopefully, spare you from getting stressed once LO\u2019s here and you\u2019re all at a family event.

Like I said if you had said you don't want her around your child because she is toxic that makes sense to me. It's the wanting to see the look in her face when you hurt her is what I have a problem with. I get why you want to do but that would be you choosing to give into your worst instincts to inflict cruelty on someone. Why would you want to do that right having a baby which should be one of the happiest moments in your life. I don't think you can use her behavior as an excuse for any cruel actions you take. Saying she started it isn't mature. Cutting contact or keeping her away from your son because she is toxic is completely understandable. If that is what you want to do than inform her and your in laws now that based her bad behavior towards you and her unwillingness to discuss her issues you don't feel comfortable maitining a relationship with such a toxic person nor do you feel comfortable with someone like that around your child. That is the mature, adult way to handle the situation.
