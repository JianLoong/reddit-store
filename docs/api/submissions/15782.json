We have a 9 year old daughter Lauren together and my step daughter Riley is 18. \n\nAbout a year ago I booked a vacation with my girlfriends for one of their bachelorette parties. It\u2019s this weekend in Tennessee. We leave Thursday and come back Monday. \n\nThis weekend Lauren has a cheerleading competition that Josh is taking her to. Lauren is required to have a guardian there the whole time and she needs to arrive early Friday and leaving Sunday. We did ask the cheer director if a friends mom could bring her and my husband could meet her there after but they said no. And if she\u2019s not there for the check in time she can\u2019t compete that weekend. \n\nRiley\u2019s prom is Friday. Riley did not have a junior prom and her school only has senior prom. We found out the date of prom after school started and the trip had already been booked and paid for. \n\nMy husband is now going to be missing Riley\u2019s prom to take Lauren to her competition. \n\nRiley thinks this is extremely unfair and that we\u2019re playing favorites since she\u2019ll never get this chance again and she wants pictures with her dad and sister. She\u2019s been messaging my husband about it. \n\nLauren doesn\u2019t want to miss her competition and risk her spot on her team. \n\nMy husband asked if I\u2019d cancel my trip and I told him no. The trip has been booked, paid for, and I also need a break. He takes breaks and trips as well. \n\nMy husband and I are now fighting because he feels like no matter what he does he\u2019s stuck. He\u2019s already told Lauren he\u2019ll be taking her to the cheer comp which means he\u2019ll be missing prom. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nUpdate: \n\nI have decided to stand my ground that I will not be cancelling my trip. I will be getting on the plane in the morning. \n\nJosh just sat down me, Riley, and Lauren to talk about the weekend. He explained he\u2019ll be taking Lauren to her competition while Riley\u2019s mother takes pictures with her at prom. He said he taught the girls about commitment and he\u2019s not going to have Lauren\u2019s absence have the team Forfeit. \n\nHe told her we could do pictures if she wanted to put her dress on a second time but she said it won\u2019t be the same and she\u2019s upset. \n\nRiley is upset with her father and thinks he\u2019s favoring Lauren.", "created_utc": 1682564925, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13083rd/aita_for_my_husband_missing_his_daughters_prom/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is no reason they should restrict another member of the family from bringing her, or simply allowing her to go with another parent and a permission slip.", "Wait. Why are adults involved in prom?", "Both parents, YTA. I guarantee you knew about prom months ago & could have worked something out for everybody to be happy. \n\nYou\u2019ve known Riley since she was a little younger than your daughter\u2026 is there ANY reason you would have Lauren get ready for prom with no family around to take in the big day? \n\nYou honestly should cancel the trip, but if you weren\u2019t going to, your husband shouldn\u2019t have agreed to the cheer trip, or you should have worked it out well in advance with the director.\n\nThere are lots of ways this could have been handled, and I can\u2019t imagine how hurt Riley is that you\u2019ve handled it in the worst way possible", "YTA for your dismissive attitude toward Riley.  Frankly, I can understand why she said you\u2019re playing favorites.  If it weren\u2019t for that, this would be a N A H.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry but a Bachelorette trip should not come before your child and your husband being a good father to his daughter. Part of being a parent means you won\u2019t always get to go what you want. Take your daughter to her cheer competition and he can go to prom pics", "Also, YTA as is your husband. Prom happens once. Your 9 year old has plenty of cheerleading competitions. The focus should be the once in a lifetime deal. No wonder your stepdaughter is totally pissed. Do better", "It sounds like this is just one more occasion Riley feels pushed aside for your daughters sake, she clearly doesn't feel like a priority to you or your husband, so you both suck for that.", "YTA. Lauren will barely remember this competition as she gets older but Riley will always remember that her dad wasn\u2019t there to see her off for the prom. Either cancel the trip or tell Lauren she can\u2019t go to the competition. Your daughter and stepdaughter\u2019s needs should come first. You shouldn\u2019t be ok with your stepdaughter being heart broken just so you can go on a bachelorette trip. \n\nAsk yourself this question: if  husband was going to miss Lauren\u2019s prom would you tell her to suck it up or would you do everything in your power to make sure that didn\u2019t happen?", "Congratulations, you're officially the evil step mother. You've made it abundantly clear that your step daughter is not a priority. Prom is stupid asf and I didn't even go to one of mine. I remember nothing about the one I actually went to. But I definitely remember all the times in my childhood where I wanted and needed a parent to show up for me and they chose not to. Have fun on your girls trip and don't you fucking dare have the audacity to utter the phrase \"idk why my step daughter doesn't speak to us anymore\" in 5 years.", "Nah - so OP cancels her trip and takes the child to cheerleading.\n\nShe\u2019s still missing photos with her sister. It\u2019s not fair to make her sister skip her cheerleading competition. I would be *pissed* if I was rhe younger child and lost a weekend competition, spot on team, just to take photos for a dance. Her bio mom will also most likely be there to help her get ready. So it\u2019s not like she\u2019s going get ready for prom alone.\n\nOP is going to throw how much money away on cancelled flights, hotels, and activities?\n\nWhat time is she getting ready vs what time does she daughter have to be at cheerleading? Can you FaceTime?\n\n\n\nETA: also, why didn\u2019t the husband figure something out beforehand? He had to have known when prom was beforehand. He also knew when the bachelorette party was. And when the cheerleading competition was. Why did *he* put in effort to figure out a solution?", "I don't get why everyone is acting like an adult's world needs to revolve around prom. I remember who I went to prom with, I don't remember the hour at my house beforehand where the parents insisted on taking photos. I know for a fact some of the parents weren't there for the photos, because they had to work or do other stuff. It's prom, not a wedding or a graduation. Prom is about the kids spending time with each other, it's not a family event.", "Actions have consequences when the oldest starts to resent the youngest here is the answer as to why.", "YTA. I'm sure if it was your daughter's prom you would have cancelled the trip without even thinking about it twice", "On the surface, this appears to be a case of bad timing. The bachelorette party and cheer competition weren't planned explicitly for prom weekend. Sometimes that's just how things work out, and I wouldn't call you an AH for that.\n\nLooking at your comments, however, your opinion on this seems to be \"not my circus, not my monkeys.\" Since Josh is the one who committed to the cheer competition, since Riley is his daughter, this is his problem, not yours. That's an incredibly short-sighted view for somebody who claims to love all of the people involved. Can you fly off to Tennessee and leave him to deal with the aftermath? Absolutely! But I can guarantee you that won't be the end of things, and the problems will still be waiting for you when you get back. \n\nRiley will still feel like she's not as important to either you or her father as Lauren is. Josh will be frustrated with himself for not being able to please both of his girls- and with you, his partner, for being more concerned with \"well I didn't make this mess\" than with the emotional well-being of his children. And while Lauren is theoretically getting what she wants here, her father will probably be distracted during the weekend, and her relationship with her sister will be damaged, neither of which will be encouraging her to perform at her best.\n\nBefore you leave, you have a chance to fix this. To make sure everyone in the home feels like their needs are being addressed, if not fully met. Would it suck to miss something you've been looking forward to for a year? Absolutely! But if the only way for you to be happy is to make everyone else in your life miserable, and you've decided you're okay with that, then yes, YTA.", "\"I standing my ground.\" YTA", "YTA. You and your daughter are both having your needs met; your step daughter is not. Message to the step daughter is loud and clear: she matters less in the family. \n\nIf you really can\u2019t cancel your trip, you should pull your daughter from cheerleading and let your husband support his other daughter. Or do a good thing for your family and cancel your trip to ensure both daughters are supported.", "YTA.\n\nProm never comes back. \n\nShould you be able to have some time to focus on your self? Sure! Know when? **When all commitments for the kids are done, they come first.**\n\nYour husband gets it. Now you need to.", "What is your relationship with Riley? Is this another one of those blended families where the older child from the previous marriage gets treated like second rate crap and always has to take a back seat to the new child that you both parented? In other words, is there a pattern here of the younger daughter always taking first priority? \nMore info is needed. You don't sound terribly concerned that Riley will miss out on prom pics with her dad.", "She's 18, why is she missing prom?", "Maybe I\u2019m overlooking something.  Trip was planned months ago.  Prom date was determined right after school started.  When was this cheer competition planned?", "YTA. Wanting a break is fine, but as parents, it\u2019s good to put your kids first for these things.", "This post made me so angry that I don't even comment on this sub but I had to so OP gets it through her head. \n\nYou know what's really naive about your logic?\n\nYou're asking both your daughters to either sacrifice or compromise something \n\nBut you. The adult. And the parent. Don't want to sacrifice or compromise anything. Your entire posts and comments have just been about you and your trip\n\nI doubt this trip is only one day so maybe the adult thing to do is maybe go one day late. You're clearly not the maid of honor or anything important in planning the wedding. Why not delay your trip a day so your husband and daughter don't miss an important moment \n\nYou keep saying it's your husband's mess to deal with yet you fail to even take any accountability or even empathy for your daughters. It's just you and your trip. \n\nYTA and your comments don't give me any hope but I will tell you this as the child of parents who are divorced both of your kids will resent you if you don't step up as a parent.", "YTA-\nWhat the hell was the point of posting this if you didn\u2019t want to hear anyone out? \nCongrats on making your step kid not want to talk to either of you by the way. It may just be a prom, but it\u2019s not just prom to *her.* It\u2019s important to her. \n\nYour trip is important to you. But is it worth possibly screwing up your family dynamic in the long term? That\u2019s up to you to decide. \nI honestly don\u2019t see the step-kid letting this go. That\u2019s my opinion from seeing my friends get screwed by their step parents. \n\nThe ball\u2019s in your court now- do whatever you can live with.", "Yta.\n\nYes while everything is paid off just leave a day later to take the younger one to her competition.\n\nIt seems you are set on going on this trip and leaving your partner stuck between a rock and a hard place. More than likely the decision he makes will change the course of his relationship with one of his daughters.\n\nHow will you feel if he decides to forgo the younger ones competition?", "YTA. You need to skip the bachelorette party.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, as a parent, you can\u2019t commit to year our plans for a bachelorette party for situations like this. A bachelorette party is fun, but it\u2019s nowhere near the equivalent of the wedding itself.\n\nYour husband needs to be there for Riley, so you have to make the sacrifice for Lauren.", "You can tell how many teens are on this sub by all of the \u201cPrOm Iz a ONCee iN a LiifFeTiMe EggZPeeRienCe!\u201d \n\nGimme a freaking break and get an ounce of perspective, people.\n\nHe\u2019s not missing Riley\u2019s wedding.

Kids over bachelorette trip.", "YTA\n\nBUT based on your responses to everyone you will not be changing your plans. \n\nTHEREFORE here is what I suggest to attempt to salvage your husband\u2019s bond with his first daughter:\n\nHave your step daughter put on her prom dress ahead of time and take pics with dad and sister (and you if she wants you in them). Have dad buy her a flower bouquet, card and necklace that she can wear to prom and leave them on the counter when he leaves for young daughter\u2019s tournament. Have dad FaceTime her when she\u2019s going out the door so he can affirm that she looks beautiful and that she found the gifts. \n\nWhen she gets home he can order late night pizza and have a chill hangout and ask how everything went.", "NAH. I understand why Riley is upset, but it's not like you intentionally scheduled your trip during her prom. Neither did her dad. You planned both of them well beforehand, you didn't know the timing would coincide with her prom.", "NAH\n\nUnfortunate scheduling problem. No one seems to be at fault but maybe you could do something to make Riley better about not having her dad there. She still gets to go to prom so that\u2019s the important part. Maybe pre-staged photos with a practice hair and makeup round if she\u2019s into that?", "YTA, you are really doing your best to push your Stepdaughter out of your family.", "YTA 100%", "YTA for choosing your Bachelorette trip over your children", "YTA.  As soon as the prom and date for the competition were known, you should have canceled your girls trip.  You can take a break, but it doesn't need to be during this specific weekend.", "From your comments this increasingly looks like an anger move at your husband with zero care or love for your stepdaughter. Horrible, I feel so sorry for her. YTA and a selfish one at that.", "Have you asked the director if you can give a relative a medical POA for your daughter? That might solve the whole legal guardian in case she gets hurt issue. But how you phrased your post it made it sound like Riley wanted Lauren in the prom pics too right? \n\nLauren is 9, it wouldn't even jeopardize her cheering in middle school if she misses this one competition. We all did things we didn't want to do/ missed things we wanted to do as children, Lauren needs to deal with it. They can't always get their way. \n\nRiley only has one prom and if she wants pics with her sister and dad then they need to be there for her.\n\n Honestly, it's still shitty that you won't cancel your trip so you can take pics with Riley too. You can't delay flying out by a day? Is potentially ruining /causing damage to your relationship with your husband and stepdaughter worth one  more day of vacay? \n\nYou don't have to cancel your trip... just buy a plane ticket for the following day. Yeah, you'll lose out on the money for the original ticket out but who cares. In the grand scheme of things, it's not worth that much.\n\nYTA along with your husband and Lauren", "NAH\n\nThis is a really shitty situation. I feel for everyone involved cause there really isn't anything that can be done. If anything, the people running that cheer comp are kinda an ah here. They're forcing him to go when a responsible adult that is well known to you is offering to help.", "Prom is clearly important to Riley.\n\nShe wouldn't get to take photos with her sister whatever happened - Lauren has a cheerleading competition, so she'd be out of town regardless of whether you were available or not. So Riley's desire to have photos with her sister is never going to happen - prom is important to Riley, but not to Lauren, and it would be absurd for Lauren to miss her competition just to have her photo taken next to Riley in a prom dress.\n\nThe truth is, Lauren can't do her competition without a parent. Riley doesn't need her hand holding to go to prom.\n\nProbably the best plan is for husband to go to cheerleading with Lauren, and have he and Lauren take formal photos with Riley when they're all available.\n\nAre you an AH for booking a bachelorette party for May in your step-daughter's senior year? Probably not.\n\nNTA", "YTA. Either cancel the cheer competition or you leave a day late for your trip. Prom pics are important, as is having the support of your family on a big event. It\u2019s one cheer competition. Prom won\u2019t happen again.", "YTA. Both you and your husband. He's missing her prom. She won't ever get this back again.

Your stepdaughter is only having one prom. Your daughter is 9 and will have other competitions.", "YTA for deciding some pathetic girls weekend is more important than your family. I hope you come home to divorce papers.", "How did your husband decide that taking Lauren to camp was important than the prom? I bet Riley was not a part of this decision and it was just you two.", "YTA. I did sports since I was in elementary school and my dad was not always there. \n\n1. If your daughter loses her spot on the team, maybe it's because she was not good enough or she lacked dedication. She has YEARS more of cheering to do. \n2. You're making your husband choose so you could just go to a bachelorette party? You are a mother now, sometimes you have to make sacrifices for your kids! \n3. You're telling your step daughter to just wear the dress again but you know it won't be the same! Haven't you thought that maybe she wants to feel loved by her dad and stepmom for once.", "Yeah you\u2019re a straight up AH. Way to shit on the step kid for a bachelorette party. JFC OP. You\u2019re a grown ass woman. Act like it.", "YTA. Your husband is right. No matter what he does, it will be wrong. If he goes to the cheer retreat one daughter is screwed, if he goes to prom his other daughter is screwed. It's a no win. BUT if you think about it, it's HIS DAUGHTER getting screwed, NOT OP's DAUGHTER. If the husband went to prom, I bet the op doesn't get on that plane.", "YTA.\n\nYes, you need a break, but it's coming at the cost of your husband's relationship with his daughter. But from your comments, you don't seem to care. Your step daughter will not forget this, and possibly won't forgive one or both of you. But again, you don't seem to care, b/c you're getting what you want; a boozy weekend with friends.", "YTA - all your replies are that it's your husband's problem because you're going to drink your face off. Youngest doesn't go to the competition then. Evil step mom vibes here.", "YTA. You should be there for Riley instead of going on this trip or at least take Lauren to the competition and let your husband go to the prom with Riley.\n\nBTW, how many bachelorette parties are there? You mention that it's only one of the bachelorette parties.", "He was going to be his daughter's date? Yes! Don't make him stand her up!!   \n\n\nWhat's that? He's going to be home while she goes out to the prom and has a great time on her own? Oh...ummm...NTA.", "YTA though holy crap, so is Lauren's school.\n\nYou *could* cancel your trip, you just don't think it's important enough to do so.  And Riley will *definitely* see that.  \n\nThe school's being a *gigantic* AH here, too, but there will be other competitions for Lauren, so if he absolutely had to, Dad could cancel, too.  Though Lauren would resent that and her sister so it's not good.\n\nBetter for you to cancel so you can go with Lauren.", "YTA. I think that this situation is hard for everyone. But your husband needs to be at his daughter's prom. It is such a big moment for a teenager. My dad wasn't at my prom and I still wish he would have been. Will the mom of your stepdaughter be at the prom?", "YTA and clearly playing favorites.  Why are you so dismissive of a traditional capstone event for your stepdaughter?  Is boozing it up with your gal pals that important?", "Easy. You cancel your trip and take Lauren to her competition and hubby takes Riley to the prom.", "Yta", "YTA. What would you say if your husband decided to \"stand his ground\" and not take Lauren on the cheerleading trip?", "YTA\n\nYou say that you hoped that the dates didn't coincide when the holiday was booked so you knew it was a possibility.  The prom date was known months in advance.  This could've been moved months ago if the bride really wanted you there.\n\nYour husbands sitting down and saying that commitments matter so he will take Lauren to the cheer competition and you will go on the holiday doesn't hold water.  \n\nThis does have the potential to irreversibly change the relationship he has with his oldest daughter.  Don't be too surprised if she stops coming along to things that are important to you and her dad and possibly Lauren too.  Oh I have a hike I've already arranged with my friends the day of your 20th wedding anniversary and it's a commitment that I said I'd go to... so won't be there.  Lauren's prom... she wants photo... oh what a shame I can't make it but I've made other plans.", "YtA - You\u2019re prioritizing yourself, then Your child, then your step child then you\u2019re stomping on your husband and his relationship with his daughter. \n\nBetter make sure that your trip comes first though because you deserve this break.", "YTA. Spend the money and have your flight leave in the middle of the night prom night (which could have been switched immediately when the date came out with probably no issues) and switch parents at cheerleading so dad can do prom pictures. This is a once in a lifetime event (prom) and your favorite child is obvious. Alternatively months ago, when the prom date was announced, you should have made it clear to the cheer coach that your daughter wasn't available under any circumstances that weekend unless someone else could take her. I hope Riley never forgives you.", "NTA but I do feel for your step-daughter.  This is a moment she will never get back.

Too bad a family solution cannot be worked out..", "To all the NTA, are you seriously saying a 9 year old\u2019s cheerleading competition is more important than a once in a lifetime prom? Then you are all TA!", "YTA...your daughter is 9 and will have other cheer competitions. Riley is 18 and will never have another Senior prom. It's important to her. Again, she won't get another one.

You should take your daughter to her comp and your husband can come meet you after pictures and you can leave the following morning", "NAH. While it's understandable Riley is upset, no one is playing favorites. Conflicting events happen in life and it's no one's fault. You committed and paid for a bachelorette trip a year ago, long before anything else was scheduled. You would lose money and time away if you cancel, and miss celebrating with a friend. Lauren can't compete without a guardian present, and if she's not there the whole team forfeits which isn't fair to the team. Riley won't have her father or sister there for photos, but even if you canceled your trip her sister wouldn't be there. It's sucks all around.", "The solution here is for your husband to explain to his 9 year old daughter why she can't go and be there for the older one.

Her reaction to her dad potentially missing her prom is a clear sign that him skipping it will seriously damage her relationship with her dad. \n\nI\u2019d almost suggest contacting the competition and explain that both you and your husband are traveling, and X- person is the legal guardian of your child for that period of time, and they are taking them there.

Yeah, prom is a \"once in a lifetime event\" but her dad's not going to be attending the once in a life time event even if he was free.

Everyone *does* favour Lauren!\" train without really stopping to think about the info we have. Lauren requires a parent present for a competition that has other people relying on her, one of her parents is busy, has had plans for ages. Riley wants her dad to take some photos with her. Lauren clearly has a greater need of her father's presence. If this is Riley's idea of \"favouring\" Lauren... it seems to me more like Riley is selfish and prioritizes her own desires, or is jealous of a much younger sibling who has consistently been at at a stage in life where she has different parental needs. I'm *really* thinking it's not a case of favouring the sister since she specifically says she also wants pictures with Lauren, who even if OP was available, would not be present. It sounds like she doesn't even want OP to stay home so her dad can be there, but rather that she wants her dad to cancel Lauren's thing so both her dad and sister are present for photos, which is incredibly selfish.\n\nOf course it's possible this is just a \"last straw\" thing for Riley and there is favouritism happening, but we don't have any other info to determine that. A child claiming that the other child is the \"favourite\" doesn't make it true.

It\u2019s this weekend in Tennessee. We leave Thursday and come back Monday. \n\nThis weekend Lauren has a cheerleading competition that Josh is taking her to. Lauren is required to have a guardian there the whole time and she needs to arrive early Friday and leaving Sunday. We did ask the cheer director if a friends mom could bring her and my husband could meet her there after but they said no. And if she\u2019s not there for the check in time she can\u2019t compete that weekend. \n\nRiley\u2019s prom is Friday. Riley did not have a junior prom and her school only has senior prom. We found out the date of prom after school started and the trip had already been booked and paid for. \n\nMy husband is now going to be missing Riley\u2019s prom to take Lauren to her competition. \n\nRiley thinks this is extremely unfair and that we\u2019re playing favorites since she\u2019ll never get this chance again and she wants pictures with her dad and sister. She\u2019s been messaging my husband about it. \n\nLauren doesn\u2019t want to miss her competition and risk her spot on her team. \n\nMy husband asked if I\u2019d cancel my trip and I told him no. The trip has been booked, paid for, and I also need a break. He takes breaks and trips as well. \n\nMy husband and I are now fighting because he feels like no matter what he does he\u2019s stuck. He\u2019s already told Lauren he\u2019ll be taking her to the cheer comp which means he\u2019ll be missing prom. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
