She has three daughters - 10,13 and 14. The oldest daughter has a different dad than the younger two. While the younger daughters dad has contact with them and takes them every other weekend the oldest daughter's dad hasn't been in her life since she was born. \n\nShe and her daughters moved in with me after 3 months together. Which I know might seem like it was too soon but her housing situation wasn't great (she was living with a friend from work). I don't have any kids of my own so I don't really know how to be a parent but I've always tried my best to support my girlfriend in her parenting decisions. \n\nTwo days ago I finished work early so I picked the girls up from school, they usually take the bus but I called my girlfriend after I finished work and she asked me to pick them up. When we got home I heated up dinner for them and afterwards I asked them if they wanted to go shopping with me and grab some pizza afterwards. The youngest two didn't want to go, their friend was coming over so they decided to stay but the oldest daughter wanted to come with me. So I took her to the mall, bought her some clothes, a new phone case and some other small things. Afterwards we went to grab a pizza. \n\nAfter the pizza I wanted to drop her off at home (my girlfriend was already back from work by then) as I needed to go to a rental property of mine to fix a few things but she said she wanted to go with me. So we did. She spent most of the time on her phone and she tried on some of the clothes she bought and showed me. We came home around 9pm and that's when the fight broke out. \n\nMy girlfriend was really angry at me for only taking the oldest daughter and not her other two. So I explained the situation about their friend coming over and that they didn't want to go with me. But she claimed I was favouring the oldest daughter which isn't true as I wanted to take all three of them. We had a huge fight about it, it was our first serious fight. The oldest daughter stepped in my defence but that didn't help. Since then my girlfriend has been cold to me. I offered to take all the girls together another time but she said she doesn't want my pity. I don't feel like I was in the wrong because I tried to take all of them shopping but they didn't want to. So AITA in this situation?\n\n(I apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors, English isn't my first language)", "created_utc": 1700052088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vst26/aita_for_only_taking_one_of_my_girlfriends/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think she\u2019s confused on whom should be cold to whom. Yikes.", "NTA - It's not your fault that the younger daughters didn't want to go shopping with you. You offered, they declined. You even tried to take them all another time. Your girlfriend is overreacting and taking it out on you.", "NTA\n\nYou literally offered to take all three\u2026\nYour GF needs to chill out", "NTA. But this was a fight about something other than taking a kid shopping.", "NTA. So girlfriend and her three dependents move in after 3 months. That's really fast. And you pick up her kids from school at her request instead of letting them go home via bus. That was nice (and unnecessary) of you to do. And you take one daughter to the mall and buy her stuff and out for pizza. And your girlfriend's first reaction when you come home is to yell at you for not taking all the kids. Not any appreciation for picking them up, and fixing them a snack, and buying stuff and entertaining the eldest. And now she's being nasty to you?\n\n\nShe sounds argumentative and ungrateful. You sure you want to get further into this relationship?", "NTA - the other two declined, so not an AH here. But is it possible there is a perception you are favoring one kid over the other two overall?", "NTA\n\nThis is one of those weird dynamics that is difficult to navigate.", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong. It's not like you could have forced the other two to go with you instead of spending time with their friends and it wouldn't have been fair to cancel the shopping thing with the oldest either. Your gf overreacted. But also she was just trying to make sure that her other two kids were not treated badly. Better to have a conversation explaining everything once she's calmed down. But you're definitely not the AH", "Am I the only one that noticed that the eldest daughter(different father) and next daughter are only a year apart?  I see perhaps cheating in this history(could be reddit suspicion tho)", "NTA\n\nSounds like they need to move back out.  Your GF is over reacting.  You did nothing wrong.  The youngest 2 chose to stay home.\n\nI would not allow this level of disrespect.", "NTA \n\nYour girlfriend needs to calm down, you asked all 3 and two of them said no. \n\nInfo - did the younger two tell the girlfriend that you didn't invite them?", "NTA, of course. How could you possibly be the asshole in this situation the way you described it?", "NTA - Your girlfriend is being completely unreasonable and spoiled what sounded like a really nice day.", "NTA\n\nSounds you are starting to discover her true colours - btw thats exactly the reason why it wasn't a good idea to move her in after 3 months. You barley knew each other and there will be some deal breakers and it will break especially oldest daughters heart if its not gonna work out. You may end up stuck in a relationship you don't want anymore but can't break up bc you don't want to hurt the kids. \n\nFor next time, a mom who is willing to move her kids into a new guys house after only three months is a big red flag. She is not a good mom and her kids aren't her first priority. Thats never a good sign when it comes to personality. \n\nJust imagine you have a kid with her, the relationship doesn't work out and she is moving in all her kids including yours with a new dude shortly after - would you be fjne with this? Bc this could very well be your future, considering that none of her relationships worked out so far and she already has 3 kids...", "Yikes.

That was a very big mistake, and I almost can't believe you're labeling this about the social activity! You should have **made her pay for it with her own money**.\n\nI agree with your girlfriend completely. If you had any intent to buy stuff for any of her children on this first outing, you needed to take all of them, or none at all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I mean what were you supposed to do? 1) Make the other 2 go so that they can start resenting you for making them do stuff they don't want to do 2) not go and then possibly create resentment between the daughters? Neither one of these options are fair to either party. Your GF needs to chill out. If the daughters were happy with the situation then that's all that should have mattered. Honestly, this makes me feel sad for the oldest daughter. Like does you GF think it's fair that the oldest gets to sit home while the other two get to go do fun stuff with their dad? I get that it's not your GF's fault that their dad is in their life and the oldest dad isn't... But when you have someone willing to step up for all 3 and 2 of those don't want to do something, you shouldn't punish the 3rd daughter nor the partner trying to step up because she has no one else and the other 2 do. She needs to look at this situation from all angles.", "It would have been nice to pick something small out with the oldest for the younger two. As a sign they were on your mind, even if they couldn\u2019t come. But NTA for not forcing her younger daughters to go with you. That would have been ridiculous. So you handled things well.", "NTA you offered and only one daughter wanted to go. What is your Gf actually mad about because this is nonsense.", "NTA for leaving bratty kids at home", "Any blame in this lies squarely with your GF. Unless the younger two were rude about your invitation. They didn\u2019t do anything wrong by not attending. I don\u2019t think you blame them but I just want to put it out there. As I read this, they declined politely (as politely as a teenager does haha).", "NTA I'd have broken up with her and kick her out over this.", "Major NTA you did good here. I don't know why your GF freaked out here that's worrying.", "NTA, but next time, I might suggest 2 things:\n1.  Give your GF a head's up.  I.e. tell her at the beginning of the afternoon out, not the end.  That way she has time to process and feel part of the decision.\n\n2. Come back with something nice for the others in the house.  It might feel unfair if one got gifts and the other 3 girls (including your GF here) got nothing.  It doesn't have to be big, just something that shows you were thinking of all of them.", "Tbh, it sounds like 1 of 2 things that's causing OPs gf to blow up like this.\n\n1. She's worried about OP favoring her older daughter over her younger two because they have a dad and she doesn't.\n\nOr\n\n2. (And this again is pure speculation, despite making feel ill thinking about it) She's jealous of the attention that OP paid to her oldest daughter by taking her out alone and views her as \"competition,\" so to speak.\n\nI'm really hoping and praying it's the first one because that's easily talked about and dealt with.", "Agreed, it sounds more like OPs gf is worried that OP is going to favor the oldest daughter more because she doesn't have a father figure while the younger 2 do.\n\nThis is something that needs to be talked about as soon as she's cooled off and has had time to think about it. OP couldn't force the younger 2 to go with him, he's not their dad, but it also would have been grossly unfair to the oldest if OP took back the offer of shopping and pizza just because her sisters didn't want to go. Gf needs to realize that not everything has to be a \"everyone has to go, or no one does\" when it comes to siblings, and unless it happens on a regular basis, taking out one over the other isn't favoritism. OP can always take the younger sisters shopping at any time, separately or together.", "She found out when she got home from work.", "How stupid are you? In what world is a 14yr old responsible for buying her own clothing? Or even phone case, seeing how most parents buy them to protect the phone they bought for their child? If the 2 younger ones would rather spend time with friends then go shopping then they don't get anything.", "And why should the oldest daughter miss out on a shopping trip just because her sisters would rather hang out with their friends? If they didn't want to go by their own choices, then they missed out on having stuff brought for them.  OP can always take them shopping another time if they want.\n\nPlus, it doesn't always have to be \"all or not at all\" for siblings. If one is invited to a birthday party for a friend, do you expect the others to be invited too? No, because only one was invited.", "Are you OP's GF?", "I honestly thought directly about number 2, but hope, it is not the case", "Honestly it sounds like your gf doesn\u2019t appreciate you at all. You got them out of a bad situation and she just wants more. NTA but take a look at this fresh relationship and ask if you\u2019ll be TA to yourself for staying", ">And why should the oldest daughter miss out on a shopping trip just because her sisters would rather hang out with their friends?\n\nI in no way stated she should have. The complaint of favoritism isn't about the social attention. It's about the material goods. He should made her pay her own way for new ***stuff***.", "Comments that accuse other commenters of being one of the parties in the dispute for the sole reason that you disagree with the comment are unhelpful.", "I hope it's not the case either. It's sad and gross when mothers view their minor daughters as competition for the attention of a grown man. Like, jfc just why? \n\nPlus if your adult partner was interested in your minor child that way, the last thing you should be is fucking jealous, you should be protecting your child and getting them as far away from the creep as possible.", "Again, why? She's 14, so adults are legally responsible for buying her clothes and stuff, plus OP wanted to do something nice for her. It was a few clothes and some other small bits. It's not like he went out of his way to buy her a \u00a3500 games console+games or an expensive \u00a31k+  laptop/phone while leaving her siblings with nothing.\n\nThere's probably been loads of times her younger sisters had stuff brought for them but not the others. It's not a big deal. OPs gf is just making it one. Neither of her younger daughters seemed bothered by their sister getting new stuff.", "Your comment werent helpful either, so I'm good", "Or #3 - she's worried that OP is favoring her oldest daughter for bad/creepy reasons, but doesn't want to believe it of OP, and blew up at OP because of the conflicting feelings/worries.", "Why are you asking questions that are already fully answered? It is annoying.", "or #4 GF and her eldest daughter are not getting along 'cause puberty and she's jealous that her eldest daughter want to spend time with Stepdad without complaints.", "Because you're talking out of your backside. Not everything needs to be 100% equal between siblings every single time. It just doesn't work that way.\n\nPlus, where is a 14yo whose sole focus should be their education going to get money from? She has no dad, and we don't even know if their mum can afford to give them an allowance/spending money.", "Indeed! I guess what I'm saying is there are more than two potential reasons for the GF's response.", "This one might be it! During puberty, girls, for some reason, tend to hate on their moms. For me, it was the constant nagging about everything. I preferred my dad.\n\nNTA, but OP, you need to talk to your gf about what's going on and how to resolve it.\n\nLife is not fair. We all know it. Think the oldest doesn't feel sh!tty knowing her sisters have a present/involved dad? I presume the younger kids divide their time between homes so even if OP favors the oldest (in a non-creepy way), is that so bad? All 3 kids will have dads now.", "True, those are just the 2 that popped into my head at the time I commented.", "I was so mean to my mom at that age and for no real reason whatsoever. I was just really miserable (anxiety etc.) and she got the brunt of it."]}
