I mean that seems pretty safe to me honestly (maybe I am a little biased as I am 14)\n\nWhen my parents went to my grandparents funeral they went to a different province (we live in Canada) and were at least 12 hrs away, they left me (14) and my older bro (15) home alone for a week and called every night before bed, made sure we knew what to do in an emergency we kept doors locked ETC (also knew some neighbors and had our German shepherd dog in the house with us)\n\nTL;DR they are safer than I was lol and I am fine", "NTA.
