My ex wife(27F) who we\u2019ll call Brittany, and I decided to do \u201cshared\u201d parenting. My current wife and I get them throughout the school year while she gets every other weekend, and then she gets them majority of the summer while I get them every other weekend. So for the majority of the year, they are living with my wife and I.\n\nMy kids spent their first summer there and absolutely hated it. They have been begging me to fix it so that they don\u2019t live with her and her boyfriend during the summer. Her boyfriend (24M) does not get along well with the kids. We\u2019ll call this boyfriend Steve. The kids have accused him of abuse and neglect on multiple occasions to multiple different people. This is mostly why I got majority of their custody. There have been multiple allegations, including from other family members witnessing this behavior, CPS investigations, etc. Whenever I would bring up a concern with Brittany, she would either not respond or deflect. Even her family thinks she was grasping for straws to make me look bad.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for me was the day my son (6yrs) called everyone on his tablet begging for food. He got ahold of my mom and said Steve was sleeping, their mom was at work, and that they weren\u2019t allowed to leave their room or they\u2019d get in trouble. My mom got a hold of my wife, who then called me (while I was at work) crying; saying the kids were hungry and calling and asking for food. I immediately got a hold of Brittany and demanded an explanation for the situation. She acted like she had no idea what I was talking about, and said our son is going through a growth spurt and is just eating a lot more than usual. When my son was home with me again, I asked him about it. And he said that\u2019s just how things go at his moms. He explained that they don\u2019t really eat until their mom gets home from work (which is in the evening) and that\u2019s another reason they don\u2019t want to live there. I filed for emergency custody and full custody.\n\nEmergency custody got granted quickly, as Brittany and Steve were technically homeless over the summer and made the kids go through that with them. And yes, I asked her to let me keep the kids until she had her own residence and she refused. With emergency custody in place; this means the kids do not go to her until we go back to court, but she has visitation. \nAnd now she is very angry with me. She spews nasty comments to me here and there. And her last one she even asked \u201cWhy would you do this to the kids? If you had any concerns you could\u2019ve just talked to me.\u201d This whole ordeal is largely due to the fact the kids hate it there. They\u2019ve made the same complaints and we have had the same concerns, and Brittany and Steve have done nothing to make their home better for them after many chances. This just makes me think it will not get better. I just want my kids to be happy and safe.

Most courts operate on the assumption that it is good for the children to have a relationship with both parents, if possible. Mom isn\u2019t safe anymore, and should lose custody. If she is able to show she has cleaned her life up (dumped the boyfriend, gets a job and a stable home) she would be able to petition the court for more custody, and I would hope it would be granted. Her gender is irrelevant. A deadbeat dad can also petition for more custody if he can prove he has addressed previous concerns the court has.

I told her to give her sister some milk and that I would be there as soon as I could. I lived two hours away. I told my niece to look at the clock, and when it was X time, to look out the window every few minutes to look for me. She was in tears when I arrived, and my sister was passed out and smelled like alcohol. I changed them out of their pajamas, left my sister a note right next to her, and took my nieces out for the day.

You said you just want your kids to be happy and safe, well your kids have made their wishes clear. When she says why would you do this to the kids? It's what they asked for. When she said you could have just talked to her, you said she ignores or deflects. My question is, and no judgment im just asking, but when your kid calls begging for food why did you wait till they got back to your place? Why didn't you go and pick them up and then file for emergency custody?

My dad got full custody of me when I was a teenager, and as an adult I've gone NC with my mom. I miss having a mom, but I don't miss her.", "Actually it is about it being a mommy state. The court 1000% use to favour the mothers blindly. I know first hand. My mother was a horrible parent, absolutely terrible and they gave her custody simply because she was the mother. I witnessed it again when my 2 younger brothers were born and they gave my mother custody again over my stepfather who was clearly the better parent (2013). It wasn't until my brothers absolutely refused to return to her house that they gave custody to my stepfather(2018). Somewhere in those 5 years the courts decided to even consider the possibility that some fathers are better parents than the mothers. Most courts did not operate on the assumption that it is better to have both parents involved. It was automatically given to the mother and fathers were lucky to get every other weekend which isn't involving both parents when one parent only gets to see their kids 4 days out of the month. You also clearly know what mommy state means so not sure why you pretend to not know.", "My mum too. \n\nWe didn't have a lot, but if a friend needed a place to sleep, or a meal, she'd step in. She was mum to a few of our friends.", "Her winning is not misogynistic, it's misandristic. The court being in favor with her solely because she's a woman means they're not in favor of him because he is a man. There it's a negative towards him but a positive for her therefore misandristic. Just because you gave birth to the children does not mean you're a better parent. And the court not realizing that if the children really do not want to be with her and Steve, along with multiple reports that the children themselves and others without the fathers involvement have reported incidences of neglecting reviews, her parental rights need be terminated. The pairs that finally the courts are moving forward on that. That should have done in the first place cuz clearly she's not a good person. The fact that the courts only gave her the rights because the children need a mom in their life is misandristic. They are not favoring the dad because he is a man.\n   \nIt has nothing to do with his pay. Man being paid more typically boils down to two main factors. One she's a woman therefore society typically including her husband expects her to stay at home. Therefore she loses all an opportunities to be employed and promoted. Two a woman is less likely to be promoted into higher positions then a man. For example if an employer has two employees who are perfect for it and his choice is the man because it's a leadership role and he should be able to fill it better than her is misogynistic. Is a compounding factor of why women get paid less than men."]}
