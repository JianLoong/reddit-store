My ex wife(27F) who we\u2019ll call Brittany, and I decided to do \u201cshared\u201d parenting. My current wife and I get them throughout the school year while she gets every other weekend, and then she gets them majority of the summer while I get them every other weekend. So for the majority of the year, they are living with my wife and I.\n\nMy kids spent their first summer there and absolutely hated it. They have been begging me to fix it so that they don\u2019t live with her and her boyfriend during the summer. Her boyfriend (24M) does not get along well with the kids. We\u2019ll call this boyfriend Steve. The kids have accused him of abuse and neglect on multiple occasions to multiple different people. This is mostly why I got majority of their custody. There have been multiple allegations, including from other family members witnessing this behavior, CPS investigations, etc. Whenever I would bring up a concern with Brittany, she would either not respond or deflect. Even her family thinks she was grasping for straws to make me look bad.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for me was the day my son (6yrs) called everyone on his tablet begging for food. He got ahold of my mom and said Steve was sleeping, their mom was at work, and that they weren\u2019t allowed to leave their room or they\u2019d get in trouble. My mom got a hold of my wife, who then called me (while I was at work) crying; saying the kids were hungry and calling and asking for food. I immediately got a hold of Brittany and demanded an explanation for the situation. She acted like she had no idea what I was talking about, and said our son is going through a growth spurt and is just eating a lot more than usual. When my son was home with me again, I asked him about it. And he said that\u2019s just how things go at his moms. He explained that they don\u2019t really eat until their mom gets home from work (which is in the evening) and that\u2019s another reason they don\u2019t want to live there. I filed for emergency custody and full custody.\n\nEmergency custody got granted quickly, as Brittany and Steve were technically homeless over the summer and made the kids go through that with them. And yes, I asked her to let me keep the kids until she had her own residence and she refused. With emergency custody in place; this means the kids do not go to her until we go back to court, but she has visitation. \nAnd now she is very angry with me. She spews nasty comments to me here and there. And her last one she even asked \u201cWhy would you do this to the kids? If you had any concerns you could\u2019ve just talked to me.\u201d This whole ordeal is largely due to the fact the kids hate it there. They\u2019ve made the same complaints and we have had the same concerns, and Brittany and Steve have done nothing to make their home better for them after many chances. This just makes me think it will not get better. I just want my kids to be happy and safe.

I could see her requesting any records of you talking about her online and then trying to spin this as you disparaging her. Also, write down everything she does that is shitty. And get the kids into therapy.)", "You did try talking to her, she refused to work with you. You need to protect your children. Your doing the right thing. NTA", "NTA. If there wasn\u2019t some deep concerns about your ex and Steve, they would not have granted emergency custody. You are there to protect your kids, not your ex.", "NTA", "As for \u201cyou could of just talked to me\u201d, OP did and she excused away starving her own son. She didn\u2019t want or like OP getting a truer second opinion because the truth was she was being a very neglectful parent. Her own family doesn\u2019t have faith in her ability to be a good parent.", "Its sad they miss her, it really is. But you are currently & need to continue doing whats right by your kids. She could come see them & clearly hasnt which all the more proves why you getting custody was the right choice. Have you looked into therapy for them? I absolutely would, and maybe for all of you guys as a family. But no you are NTA for getting emergency custody & ensuring your kids are safe. *please continue to do so*", "> She hasn\u2019t scheduled any visitation \n\nThat\u2019s on her not you. You should get the kids into a therapist if they aren\u2019t seeing someone already.", "Document everything going forward, including the radio silence on her part.", "Yes, make sure that you have nothing negative to say about their mom in front of them. Not only does it make the better person, it shows that you are willing to help foster a healthy relationship between them and their mom. Plus, if you were bad-mouthing mom to them, it could be seen as parental alienation and that can be used against you, especially of you live in the U.S.", "They were bumming in Steve\u2019s uncle\u2019s living room for some time. She was never clear how often they were there or not. The kids would tell me that they slept there though. So when the police were called, they went to the uncles house and couldn\u2019t do anything since they were in immediate danger. CPS did a wellness check later on and encouraged me to also go for full custody."]}
