My partner (31M) is currently away on a week-long international vacation with his friends.\n\nHe calls periodically to check in and update me on what he's up to, which is fine and dandy... If I'm busy with the baby, I typically don't answer the phone and message or call him back later. \n\nI put the baby to sleep and wake her up at the same time every day - wake up time is 10:30 am. She's generally great at sleeping through the night, but she has been teething so it's been a lot more interrupted than usual. As a result, I am extra exhausted. \n\nMy partner knows all of this, but for two days in a row has called me before 10:30am just to tell me he's about to eat breakfast, or he's packing his bags. Yesterday, I asked him to send a message instead of calling before 10:30am because I need the sleep. At first he said he didn't care, missed me and wanted to hear the sound of my voice, but he ultimately apologized. Today, he called again and I pointed out that I had JUST asked him not to. He said that he \"saw I was online\", got excited and wanted to talk so he called.\n\nI repeated that I didn't want him to call in the morning, and told him I was hurt and confused because it seemed like he wasn't making my well-being a priority. I told him that when I get excited I don't black out and lose control of my actions, and that being excited isn't a carte blanche to ignore other people's feelings/situations. I tried not to be too harsh, but based on his reaction I wonder if there was a kinder way to explain it.\n\nHe has told me that he's homesick and misses us a lot, and I understand feeling melancholy in the morning. He isn't getting much sleep either because they have activities planned. I have definitely let a few sarcastic comments slip out - \"oh, poor you\" or \"that must be so hard\" when he tells me about an annoying situation or mentions that he's tired.\n\nIn my household growing up, sleep was very highly valued so for me it's a no-brainer, but my partner seems to genuinely feel that his emotional needs should come first.

He doesn't get to F with your or the baby's sleep.\n\nNTA\n\nINFO: Is this trip something they do every year?  Is someone getting married?  Why schedule this during your maternity leave with y'all's baby?", "NTA. While I suppose it is sweet that he wants to call so much - if he didn\u2019t call at all that would also be an issue, damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t kinda deal - he should respect the fact that you\u2019re looking after your 4 month old baby alone, while he\u2019s chilling on vacation. \n\nTo be honest it\u2019s pretty wild to me that he\u2019s on an international vacation with his friends in the first place, since you guys have a new baby.", "NTA. Your partner is being inconsiderate. Just turn off your phone when you're sleeping or mute it and all notifications. He clearly has no impetus to actually listen to you while he's frolicking around internationally and you're at home alone with a baby who isn't sleeping well.", "NTA- you are at home doing all the work caring for a 4 month old baby. He\u2019s on an international vacation with his friends, you are at home putting all the physical and emotional labor raising a child by yourself. He\u2019s ignoring your needs for his wants. Imo he shouldn\u2019t have gone period but that\u2019s not your question.

Your sleep is way more important than his self inflicted homesickness.", "Taking care of a baby is a 2-person job, IMO.

Go momma go!", "NTA.", "NTA but definitely could have been a nicer way to word that, but stressed moms be stressed moms. \nI think also the \u201cI saw you were online\u201d raises some questions for me, you were or were not asleep? Because if you were up, relaxing and browsing Reddit, I can understand a bit better why he called. Not saying we don\u2019t all need me time though, and the ring could totally wake up the baby. \nBut agreed, ol\u2019 boy should just come home from his brocation if he misses you so much.", "My god NTA, I would be livid I was so exhausted as a new mom and it's hard to fall back asleep your brain and body are on high alert to respond to baby.  I would tell him if he calls before 10:30am again you are taking his number off your whitelist, totally unacceptable while he's off on vacation.  If he misses you that much he can come home.", "NTA. Congrats on the little one. Your DH needs to understand that there has to be a balance struck. You are at home, caring for an infant single handedly, whilst he is on vacation. You need to be well rested to tackle the day and whatever comes your way. While it is nice to know he misses you, you've set your boundaries and he's ignoring them. \n\nJust because he \"saw you were online\" doesn't mean you're ready to chat. Perhaps a text message to him telling him \"now is a good time to call\" or \"anytime after 11:15 AM please\" would work?", "I'd take that as don't wake me up before then but seeing you awake I'd likely call too. BF and I do that. I'm not gonna call and wake him up at 6am (9am my time) but if I see him online then and awake I'll call.
