If I'm busy with the baby, I typically don't answer the phone and message or call him back later. \n\nI put the baby to sleep and wake her up at the same time every day - wake up time is 10:30 am.

Yesterday, I asked him to send a message instead of calling before 10:30am because I need the sleep. At first he said he didn't care, missed me and wanted to hear the sound of my voice, but he ultimately apologized. Today, he called again and I pointed out that I had JUST asked him not to.

I tried not to be too harsh, but based on his reaction I wonder if there was a kinder way to explain it.\n\nHe has told me that he's homesick and misses us a lot, and I understand feeling melancholy in the morning. He isn't getting much sleep either because they have activities planned. I have definitely let a few sarcastic comments slip out - \"oh, poor you\" or \"that must be so hard\" when he tells me about an annoying situation or mentions that he's tired.\n\nIn my household growing up, sleep was very highly valued so for me it's a no-brainer, but my partner seems to genuinely feel that his emotional needs should come first.
