Since I will be gone for 13 weeks, I will not need my car during that time, and have agreed for my sister, Alexandra(16f) to use it during that time. \n\nRecently a problem arose when I decided that when I came back from boot camp I would take my car so that I could have it wherever I was stationed. I thought that since the car is in my name and it was given to me as a gift (not by my parents but by my grandparents) this would not be a problem, or so I thought. I brought this up to my parents, and they look surprised. Apparently, behind my back, they had planned to give Alexandra the car while I was at boot camp and not return it to me once I came back. This shocked me as they had not discussed this with me. I completely own the car, and it is not theirs to give away. They also already told her that the car was hers, before ever talking to me.\n\nAlexandra has been using my car to get to and from school while I await my ship-out date. It has not been a problem as I told her she could use it, and I was under the assumption that I would also be able to use it when I needed it. Since Alexandra had been told she could have the car without my permission she assumed that she no longer had to allow me to use it.\n\nOne day I needed to go to my recruiter's office to sign some paperwork, and since Alexandra's school is 33 miles from my recruiter's office I offered to drive her to school and head to my recruiter after. She did not like this and said I should drive our mother to work, and then go to the recruiter. I tried explaining that this was not the ideal situation since our mother's job is 30 miles in the opposite direction, not including the 10 miles it takes to get to Alexandra\u2019s from our house. In the end, I had to have my recruiter pick me up and take me back to his office.\n\nThis is where I might be the AH. That night, I brought this incident up and this started a fight between me and my family. I was tired of this and I said that when I return from boot camp they will give me my car and everything I own (which is most of my clothes, and I am also currently fighting over Alexandra over this). My parents got mad and said I am a child and own nothing, not even the car. \n\nAs previously stated, it is in my name. My clothes are mostly second hand from friends, so they did not buy them. I then explained this to them and they stopped talking, Alexandra then said the car is hers, so STFU. I got mad at this and said that when I come back, my car will come with me and if I see her driving it, I will report it stolen. Now everyone says I am the AH for threatening the cops on a teenager.
