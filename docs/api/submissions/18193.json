What to buy and where to buy it from etc.\n\nREALLY being helpful to your mom would be if she just gave you cash and said \u201cI need you to help me with your brothers cake\u201d and you were put together enough to KNOW that means you also need candles and a cake slicer etc\u2026and then you go check the kitchen for those and if you don\u2019t find them, take the initiative to go buy them from a store that doesn\u2019t overcharge for them. \n\nAnd then one day, you\u2019ll really be an adult when you OFFER your mom to help like this without having to be asked. \n\nSoft YTA because you don\u2019t seem to understand what\u2019s really going on here.

You knew you could have gone to dollar tree first for candles, left them in your bag & taken them into Costco.  I live in a desert climate and when it's warm out you do have to plan your shopping out.  Unless you're new to the area I don't understand how you did this on accident.  Even if you are new to the area, it's just common sense.  There's been times when I've had to stop back at the house to drop off items and continue on my errands because my car is too hot to leave items in.  You said your mom got upset because your brother is the golden child; are you sure you didn't do this out of spite since he is the favored one?", "wow. i guess i'm in the minority here, but nta. you didn't intend for it to melt. it was an accident. could you have thought this through and gone about it better? sure, but that's usually the case in all things. your mom telling you your bro's birthday is ruined bc of this is an ah move. it's a damn cake.", "NTA. It was an innocent mistake and your mom sounds like a controlling perfectionist.", "YTA \n\nIf you know you have to get other stuff in different stores  when also planning to get something that needs proper cooling, always get the cooled stuff last. That includes birthday cakes.", "Soft YTA for being clueless that a hot car = melted cake but it's definitely not the end of the world", "damn i think some people use a y ta judgement as an excuse to unleash what ever pent up anger they have at the world because some of these comments are super intense over a fucking cake. i\u2019m going with ESH bc you obviously knew at some point the hot car would melt the cake and should have planned better but your mom\u2019s reaction was way over the top for a cake", "Um I\u2019ll go against the grain.. why couldn\u2019t mom get the cake and things? Pre planning.. mom knew his birthday was coming so not like it was a surprise.. mom could\u2019ve had all that weeks in advance. NTA", "NTA. If she got the balloons first they would have popped while she got the cake. It was a no win situation.", "Its just a fucking cake. Tastes still no matter if it looks good or not brah", "And the candles would have melted...no win situation", "It's not the mistake that makes her an asshole, it's not taking responsibility for the mistake and downplaying how long it was left for. Sometimes people make mistakes, but instead of saying \"I didn't realize it would melt that fast, sorry\" she immediately concocted all the reasons she wasn't at fault and how she I'd a victim of favouritism ect ect.\n\nAlso \"asshole\" in the context of the sub is broader than in regular usage.", "it doesn\u2019t need to be frozen, stores freeze cakes so they have a longer shelf life. you\u2019re actually supposed to it thaw before eating (not in a hot car but like on the counter)", "So she fucked up by\u2026 driving the cake home?\n\nGuess they should\u2019ve had the kids birthday party AT the Costco if the cake couldn\u2019t survive the ride home.", "Maybe OP\u2019s brother is in a trailblazing MMA league for first graders. I\u2019d PPV that shit."]}
