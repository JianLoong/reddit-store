Edited for typos.\n\nMy mother (60F) and I (33F) have a difficult relationship. My father died just before I was born, so she raised me, her only child, alone - for a while. I was 16 years old when she moved an hour away to live with a guy she\u2019d been seeing for 2 months. Our mortgage had been paid off by my grandparents, so she kept paying utilities and otherwise left me to live there alone, reasoning that I was mature enough to handle it. I bounced between my grandmother and aunts\u2019 homes to have some semblance of family, but I always knew I was an afterthought or worse, an act of charity.\n\nMy mom married that guy, who had already alienated his own children enough that they didn\u2019t speak to him. He convinced her I was a leech for needing her support, AKA the utilities she was paying. I was 17 and working two jobs to buy groceries, pay for school activities (I was in many to try to secure scholarships), and save for college, since she had no plans to help. Because of the way he characterized me, she stopped speaking to me and stopped paying for anything, so my grandparents took over until I went to school. \n\nHe died suddenly 3 years ago and, surprise surprise, my mom is now shocked to find herself alone and wants to be in my life. This is especially true with regard to my newborn son. My mom seems to understand that there\u2019s little chance of me ever trusting her again, even if I forgive her, so she\u2019s channeling everything into my boy. \n\nBut she\u2019s going too far. She talks nonstop about how stressful my long, dangerous labor was on her (she was 400 miles away at the time), so much so that she couldn\u2019t work or hang out with friends. She takes credit for his milestones and says it\u2019s because she dotes on him (duh, we all do). She talks constantly about their bond and how much she held him in his first 2 weeks, when I was recovering from labor. Worst, at least for me, is that she refers to my son as \u201cmy kid\u201d and \u201cmy boy.\u201d This makes me see red. He\u2019s my and my wife\u2019s first child, and my mom is centering herself completely. \n\nI know I have a lot of unresolved hurt here, so maybe I\u2019m being unreasonable. So, Reddit, WIBTA for telling her to stop referring to him as hers, except to say he\u2019s her grandson?", "created_utc": 1692027383, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qy34a/wibta_if_i_told_my_mother_to_stop_referring_to_my/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn\u2019t let her psychologically damage my kid. Etc. Then I woke up and realized it was already happening. She\u2019s (mother) been cut off for a decade and my daughter still has pictures of them together plastered on her walls. ETA just be super vigilant and aware of every word she says. Be prepared to sever contact.", "True. Even if we don\u2019t go NC, she\u2019s not going to get much time with him.
