Our mortgage had been paid off by my grandparents, so she kept paying utilities and otherwise left me to live there alone, reasoning that I was mature enough to handle it. I bounced between my grandmother and aunts\u2019 homes to have some semblance of family, but I always knew I was an afterthought or worse, an act of charity.\n\nMy mom married that guy, who had already alienated his own children enough that they didn\u2019t speak to him. He convinced her I was a leech for needing her support, AKA the utilities she was paying. I was 17 and working two jobs to buy groceries, pay for school activities (I was in many to try to secure scholarships), and save for college, since she had no plans to help. Because of the way he characterized me, she stopped speaking to me and stopped paying for anything, so my grandparents took over until I went to school. \n\nHe died suddenly 3 years ago and, surprise surprise, my mom is now shocked to find herself alone and wants to be in my life.

It's like that one amazing toy you wanted as a child, you can buy it for yourself now, but it doesn't feel the same because you're different. \n\nIf you insist on keeping her in your life, you'd be best to set firm and consistent boundaries. I did this with both of my parents. My dad bailed when I was 6, fucked his life up a bunch and then got on a better path. We were able to have a relationship, but not a father/daughter one, that ship had sailed. He became more like an uncle. But he let me set the terms. My mom doesn't and our relationship suffers. I have to keep reinforcing boundaries and reminding her that my kids aren't a do-over for her parenting regrets. \n\nHave you ever sat your mom down and forced her to acknowledge the abandonment? She can blame the husband all she wants, but a decent human doesn't let anyone talk them into leaving their kid. What she did is disgusting and she should be thanking you for allowing her in your life at all. \n\nDon't just think about what you can tolerate from her, think about what you WANT. Raising a baby is hard. It stays hard for a long time, in different ways. Having to constantly deal with your mom will make things harder.
