My cousin 'lilly\" has been dating \"Ben\" since they were teenagers, about 10 years. They really loved each other. Ben has a great job but is away a lot, he works away for 3 to 4months at the time, then is 1 to 2 home. For almost two years he has taking extra jobs and stayed away more to save for their wedding and help his sibling pay tuitons for uni. Meanwhile lilly lost her job during covid and moved to his tiny apartment. She decided to go back to school wich ben supported. I think this is also the reason he took extra jobs.\n\nLilly spent a few weeks with my family early this year and could barely focus. Later she told me she was pregnant. I was happy and congratulate her but she started crying. She was 10 weeks long and Ben had left for his job more than 3 months ago. She was worried, loved him, etc. I was in shock and couldn't really say anything. Next morning we went for a walk. She didn't want to share the details with me, but i told her we will help her and i adviced her to come clean with Ben. She started crying again, went back to the house and left early. We spoke on the phone but all she said was that everything was ok now.\n\nThe baby was born last month. My hubbie and i were in their city a few days after birth for an event and called ben saying we would like to drop by to give them a gift and see the baby. We couldn't reach Lilly. He was silent then said she was at her mothers.\n\nWell... it was obvious it wasn't his. Her mom told us Lilly broke down in the delivery room as soon as she saw the baby begging him not to leave... she was a mess.\n\nWe had a family get together this weekend since most will not be available around christmas. Everyone avoided lilly subject until one of the little ones asked were Ben was. Lilly said he didn't want her or the baby anymore. She was quite agressive and scared the little guy. She rambled about how life as a single mother was tough and he was a selfish man... She kept playing victim and i snapped. I said she should had seen this coming. I spoke in a lower tone but things escalated. I told her she could at least try to salvage the friendship if she was honest with him and told him the baby wasn't his. I also said that he had warn her the last time she cheated that he wouldn't forgive her (she didn't knew i knew). It was a yelling match, her mom was furious because she didn't know about a lot that happend (some more stuff were spilled out by her sister) and was under the impression that it had been a one time mistake. She was about to retire and now she has to take care of a babby and a daughter that doesn't work. It ended quite badly...\n\nMy mom called me today and said i should have been more understanding.She lost everything.the kid's father seem to want to be envolved but she doesn't want him to be in their life. I said it was her fault. She completely changed this last year, is bitter but has no one else to blame but her.\n\nWas i an ah?
