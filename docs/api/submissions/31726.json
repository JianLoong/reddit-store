I\u2019m still in high school, but I plan to live in college dorms once I graduate. However, my sister has never left. She stayed at home and drove to college since it wasn\u2019t too far. I didn\u2019t mind her at home for college since it seemed logical for her to save money. However, she graduated college about two years ago now with a Bachelor degree and seems to have no plans of leaving. For two years, my parents begged her to get a job or something, which she always brushed off. She never even applied for any jobs, always making up excuses for why she can\u2019t get a job. She\u2019s finally got a part time \u201cjob\u201d where she works as a social media coordinator for maybe six hours a week. \n\nI\u2019ve told my parents on multiple occasions to make her get a job, pay rent, or just kick her out but every time, they can\u2019t seem to do it. My mother is a bleeding heart, and my father, while having talked to her, does not actually set any ultimatums. At best, he makes her pay own insurance. \n\nNot only that, she\u2019s constantly in foul moods and is rude to both my parents and I. She complains about chores or picks fights over simple things. Increasingly, she\u2019s been passive aggressive toward all of us for reasons I don\u2019t even know. For example, during our beach trip, we took separate cars there and back. When we had to return home, my father needed to leave early since he had a meeting with someone. However, my sister freaked out that they were not leaving at the same time. She was making irrational demands and was disrespectful over nothing. She even said her behavior was crazy later that day, but didn\u2019t apologize or say she\u2019d fix it. \n\nI\u2019ve suggested therapy or medication or something as she always tells us she\u2019s \u201cneurodivergent\u201d and that we\u2019re being ableist for not accommodating her or being understanding during her outbursts, only for her to say that \u201ctherapy doesn\u2019t work on her\u201d or that she doesn\u2019t believe in medication. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m at a loss of what to do. I can\u2019t force my parents to kick her out or even punish her. I know she isn\u2019t my responsibility but I am her sister and I do have to live with her for now. My mother says I need to be more sympathetic to her since she\u2019s going through a rough patch, but I just can\u2019t seem to do it. I\u2019ve lost a lot of my respect for her due to her behavior.\n\nAITAH and what should I do?", "created_utc": 1700945886, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183tcg7/aitah_for_telling_my_parents_they_should_kick_out/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s frustrating to have a sibling that\u2019s checked out. That said, it\u2019s up to your parents whether or not to kick her out. NTA but also not your place.", "NAH, but it\u2019s not your house so it\u2019s not your call. In less than a year you\u2019ll be in college so I think you just need to wait it out.", ">I can\u2019t force my parents to kick her out or even punish her. I know she isn\u2019t my responsibility but I am her sister and I do have to live with her for now. \n\nCorrect. You're NTA, but you tried to tell them, they are stuck in their ways, and there's nothing else you can do. Just put up with it for now and you'll be off to college before you know it.", "NTA. Your parents are enabling her for not setting tougher boundaries. \n\nAlso, being accommodating of neurodivergency does not mean that other people have to tiptoe around her and cater to her every whim, it just means being respectful that others will have different needs and approaches to life and giving them as much space and flexibility as possible to operate that way. This is coming from an autistic person who has foundational knowledge in disability studies. \n\nWhat that means for your sister is that she can have a meltdown if she needs one, but she also must respect both the other needs of the family and others she shares the space with. She should be able to go to her room and process feelings how she needs to, NOT make you all collectively responsible for them. \n\nI recommend having a sit-down conversation with your parents to articulate your feelings on how she is impacting you. I also recommend reminding your parents that they can both love your sister and set stronger boundaries with her.", "You're NTA, but I'm strongly suggesting you stay completely out of it. Don't push your parents, and only get on your sister's case about things that directly affect you. Here's the rub of it - this isn't going to get better anytime soon. If it holds true to most stories like this, YOU will move out and become successful, and your parents will eventually ask you to take your sister in, because they're too old to continue supporting her. That's how most of these stories pan out. For whatever reason your parents enable this behavior, which isn't the least bit reasonable. Make sure you set clear boundaries and tell your parents you're not taking over as guardian when they no longer want to support your older sis.", "YTA. This is between your parents and your sister. If you really can't deal with it you can move out - you're 18. \n\nThat said, I'm sorry you've been dealing with this for a long time, and my judgement might have been different if you'd asked as a minor. It does sound like your sister needs some help dealing with the real world. But beyond that, we only know what you're telling us and neurodivergence can cause all kinds of issues that make it hard to live with someone. None of us are in the position to judge whether your parents should kick your sister out.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are enabling your ~~lazy~~ sister, and there's really nothing you, yourself, can do. \n\nYour best recourse is to enroll in a university far away from your family, and build your own life. It's the only way to save your sanity.\n\nAs for your sister, have your parents planned for her care once they're out of the picture? Because at this rate, she's going to get a very rude awakening about how the world actually works. She definitely needs therapy and some sort of plan moving forward--and that's not your responsibility.\n\nProtect your future self by placing strong boundaries now. You don't want to be left with an older sister who can't navigate life or the world around her.", "There\u2019s something wrong, and you know this. You know because this isn\u2019t something you or your friends would be doing at her age. \nMaybe instead of urging them to kick her out, you should urge them to insist she gets professional help. \nNAH.", "NTA. Someday your parents are going to ask you to help her, with money, a place to stay, a ride here or there, it will always be something.  Dont fall for it.  They spoil her, they can take care of her. For now, just bide your time and get out ASAP.", "YTA it's not your house, they're not your rules. You're way out of line for telling your parents what they should be doing multiple times. They've made it clear they won't be doing that. If this situation bothers you, just focus on getting a place of your own. Work as much as you can and save up your money.", "YTA.\n\nYou aren't the asshole for having an opinion on what your parents should do about your sister. You aren't even as asshole for sharing that opinion **once or twice**. \n\nBut when it gets to the point where you are telling your \"parents on multiple occasions,\" then you are crossing the line to asshole. This is about your parents' relationship with your sister, and your parents get to do what they want. \n\nOne of the biggest challenges of growing up is learning that not every problem is yours to fix. Sometimes you can make a a little nudge\u2014which you have done!\u2014but then you need to take a deep breath and let it go.", "You do you and move forward with your life. In regards to your sister, what your parents may not realize is the message they are sending her is that they have no confidence in her. By not setting reasonable expectations they obviously feel she can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s a pretty sad realization for any adult child. \n\nNTA  Your parents are not doing your sister any favours.", "NTA but speaking from personal experience (my mom was the same way with my siblings) they're all adults so they can choose to live however they want. Focus on yourself and your future so you won't have to rely on anyone else but yourself. Remember you can't control other people's actions but you can control your own!", "YTA\n\nLook your not wrong but this is none of your business. Focus on yourself and just try to stay out of her way. Let you parents deal with your sister", "NTA for how you feel, but none of this is your call. You can only control what you do. Trying to get others to change, when they're fine with how things are, is only going to stress you out. Interact at a minimum until you can be on your own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also you will be in her crosshairs next as her ATM.", "We only have the lazy sister's word about whether she is neurodivergent. It sounds like an excuse to me. She wont see a doctor, she wont take meds. I don't believe her.", "This is exactly what I was coming here to say. Build your life without the expectation of support from your parents, because your sister is laying the groundwork to never leave. \n\nGranted, I'd hope your parents would at some point require an actual diagnosis and therapy, but knowing what you know, instead of kicking her out, open their eyes by laying your own groundwork. Listen, it's early to plan for the future like this, but life is short and if something happens to one or both of you,  I will not take over the care of my sister. Make sure they have a trust to take care of her needs and hopefully leave something for you in the end. Talk like she's never leaving and they need to be prepared for that instead of kicking her out.", "Not all kinds of neurodivergence are treatable. There are no meds for autism, for example. I stand by my conclusion that we don't know enough about the sister to judge.", "I accept that. However, she refused to see a doctor. She's self-diagnosing herself. That's what made me suspicious."]}
