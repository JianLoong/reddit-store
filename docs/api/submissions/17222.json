You figured letting all 3 sleep would mean when 1 of them woke, he\u2019d be the one to wake first and deal with them, which is exactly what happened. \n\nAlso, when he does wake in the middle of the night, and finds himself still on the couch with the 2 kids and no sign of you, did you think he\u2019d just assume that you were home and leave? Is he supposed to go creeping into your bedroom to see if you\u2019re there? As far as he was concerned, until he actually saw you back home, he was responsible for your kids, and he dealt with them accordingly. \n\nGood on your wife for paying him the full night.", "YTA, if you woke him up and told him he could go home and he decided to sleep then you wouldn\u2019t have had to pay him for the extra time but since you didnt and he continued to watch your children so you could bang your wife then yeah you gotta pay him", "Disgusting.

I agree with you, you were home so his services were no longer needed. The fact he didn't know that because he was asleep and didn't know you were home is irrelevant.\n\nAnd I find it bizarre you didn't wake him.

He was asleep but still \"on call\" and you would have expected him to act if the kids needed him for anything. I don't find too much fault using the opportunity for some quality couple time, but his continued presence needs compensation and there was no reason to leave him sleeping until 5am after you got home.

I like it!", "Right?! I thought it was just me that there\u2019s at least 1 absolutely bat shit crazy post every day", "because he likely thought this way he could get free work. he doesn't have to put the kids to bed , or check on them through the night. that's what it sounds like and he thought by not waking him, he would only have to pay him for four hours because he could claim \"well he was sleeping so not working.\"", "Like please pay me for 7 hours of sleep", "When you say you \"want some privacy\" you left him to put your kids to bed while you and your wife had some time together.  That's fine  but how dare you not pay him for that time.", "Oh, I missed that part. Okay. So he left the babysitter there so he could fuck his wife. That doesn\u2019t make it less weird.", "Then the babysitter was still working.", "Right?! If they wanted some privacy, that sitter is still on duty.", "I think it\u2019s possible he did know they were home when he changed the kids but just didn\u2019t know what to do about that.
