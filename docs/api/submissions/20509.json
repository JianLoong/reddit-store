He may have taken the pieces he was missing from a copy he already had then tried to stick you with an incomplete product.", "Were there any missing pieces?", " Did he specify what pieces are missing so you can condider it? Could it be that there was a piece you weren't thinking about when you checked it? \n\nIf you're 100% sure nothing is missing, NTA and he is trying to get something for nothing. But if you have any doubts about whether there's a piece you forgot, you should ask him what he claims is missing.", "NTA. You're selling a used product, and offered the buyer the opportunity to make sure he was getting what he expected. The onus is as much on the buyer to verify as it is on the seller to be honest. I'm going with one of the other posts here... He's probably looking to fill some of his own missing pieces.", "Since you're saying you checked, NTA. You offered to let him check, which would have only taken a little time. It's not your fault he declined and left.", "NTA. Dude was obviously trying to scam you", "NTA\n\nHe refused to inspect it before buying, despite being offered to do so. His problem, not yours.", "If there were actually pieces missing then yes but otherwise NTA. He had a chance to look but didn\u2019t.", "NTA - You have no legal obligation to refund that guy. It's a private sale. If you checked everything, gave him an opportunity to check the item, and he passed it up, then that's his problem!\n\nTough luck for him.", "NTA. He had his chance.", "This depends on whether or not there were missing pieces. Did you check before you sold it? Because you can't say no missing pieces if you didn't check.", "YTA. You sold him something that didn't match the product description.", "The only reason you\u2019re NTA is \u2018cause you offered the buyer a chance to inspect before purchase.
