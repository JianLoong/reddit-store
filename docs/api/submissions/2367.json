Just kidding. I didn\u2019t change my name. Did change my whole life around though.\n\nI wanted to post this update for a lot of reasons, but mainly to express my gratitude. I didn\u2019t have a lot of friends at the time and most of them were my boyfriend\u2019s friends. I truly didn\u2019t feel like I had anyone else to go to about this, so I\u2019m so thankful for everyone who took the time to reply to my original post and provide insight. It was a lot to sift through and honestly, really painful. It felt like I was finally being validated after years of gaslighting myself. I always had a feeling that something was wrong but pushed it aside for the sake of being part of the family. The period after I posted was truly one of the lowest of my life, but also one of the most empowering. \n\nA lot of people told me to cut out my boyfriend but I didn\u2019t see the point. I didn\u2019t understand the accusations of narcissism. But when I sat down with him, explained how badly him siding with my mom hurt me, how it hurt to watch him turn against me when I needed to support, his response was, \u201cYou did this to yourself.\u201d That was the lightbulb moment I needed. We broke up, I moved in with my brother for a little while to get back on my feet. \n\nThere were a lot of recommendations to go no contact with my mom, but I had a really hard time with the idea of it. Talking it over with her was mostly unsuccessful, she kept degrading herself and sending me all these backhanded apologies that made me feel worse. Everything ended in me apologizing.\n\nMy sister had her baby. Whole family went to visit her and she told us the name - top 10, very traditional. My mom made a comment about me scaring her out of exercising creativity, without any crocodile tears or hysterics. It was pure hostility from her and it was another lightbulb. I brushed it off, apologized to my sister, stuck around for another 30 minutes, and that was it. That was the last time I spoke to my mom. \n\nMy brother harassed me about it, so I moved out of his place and into an extended stay hotel. I got a job a few states away, got an apartment, packed up my life and pretty much entirely started over. I haven\u2019t spoken to any of my family members in almost a year. \n\nThere has been a lot of therapy, as recommended. It\u2019s been a painful, sad, lonely, and frustrating experience, but I\u2019m also so much better off. I have new friends, I actually like my job a lot better now, and I\u2019m creating my own weird little family with my pets, a family that I\u2019m really a part of.\n\nAgain, thank you to everyone who provided input.

Names are such a funny thing, I personally love the name Waverly but as someone who changed their name from something plain and Top 3, to something normal but not top 1000, I completely feel you not identifying with a name that just doesn\u2019t fit.

Good luck in your future endeavors.", "Congratulations on your new life! I just read your earlier post and was astounded by how poorly your mom and half siblings treated you. I\u2019m sorta surprised you didn\u2019t have to sleep under the stairs like Harry Potter. Or maybe you did. As for the step father who metaphorically would have dropped you off at the nearest orphanage, he can rot.

I'm so glad for you that you realized you shouldn't be apologizing all the time for the same thing.  When you first apologized to your mom, she should have accepted the apology.  She showed her true narc tendencies by making a scene repeatedly, bringing up the subject over and over, all just to make you keep apologizing and validating her.  No one is worth that much effort.  And you shouldn't have had to do it at all.  You are allowed to have an opinion on your name.\n\nAs to the Ex-BF, glad to read he got kicked to the curb.

It's cool seeing someone take the time to think about all of the uncomfortable things, and be able to break out of it and do what's best for you. I'm 35 and still working on doing the same, but I'm going to keep going. Unfortunately I can't fully ditch the narcissist, as we have a kid together.

It's so difficult to make that step and congratulations!!!", "What an amazing update. Congratulations! It may take a lot of work but the feeling of freedom is truly priceless.\n\nI just want you to know OP, since the last TV show I watched is fresh in my mind, I kept saying \"histrionics\" and \"sedation is what she needs\" in a thick accent and an extreme look of distaste while reading about your mother's theatrics.\n\nWishing you many healthy and positive relationships and moments.", "I'm truly proud of you and happy for you!

It\u2019s not an easy thing to cut out toxic family. And the very best wishes for your future.", ">My mom made a comment about me scaring her out of exercising creativity\n\nNaming one's child is the worst time to exercise creativity. Just give the kid a normal name. Children are people, not accessories or trophies.\n\nA good parent considers their child and considers how the name will affect their child throughout life. It's terrible to name your child something \"creative\" and \"unique\" just because you want to feel special.\n\nIt's great that you were able to break free from all the toxicity. I'm sorry that your ex was so awful towards you. He should've stood by your side and supported you. Instead, he blamed you for something that was never your fault. \n\nI hope you never have to be subjected to your mother's manipulation and emotional abuse again. Calling herself a terrible mother was done to guilt trip and manipulate you. It sounds like she never really thought about you or considered your feelings. She was too focused on herself.\n\n>There has been a lot of therapy, as recommended. It\u2019s been a painful, sad, lonely, and frustrating experience, but I\u2019m also so much better off.

Not exactly the happiest update, but one for the better.\n\nI hope that you'll soon be able to see entirely on your own that this is an incredibly happy update.

(Never call him King or Henry, his first name is King Henry, or just call him KH or Foul Mouth) It's a favorite series of mine, author based it on the concept of what would it *really* be like if you threw an abused boy into a wizard school-in this case they're Mancers-Geomancers, Pyromancers, etc.", "They're really nice people who throw great barbecues.  I've been friends with Donna for very long time.  They love the names.  Donna (the daughter) used them as middle names because her husband didn't want his kids and their cousins to have the same name.  Donald (the son) had step-children, but none of his own. Dana is married and already talking about continuing the tradition.    \n\nWhat's stranger to me is that they don't use any nicknames and the names all sort of sound the same, so unless you're really paying attention it's sometimes hard to know exactly who they're talking about.  \n\nRonald, maybe it's the R, but he's always had a bit of trouble finding himself.  Currently living with and \"helping\" his grandmother, though mostly hanging out in the basement."]}
