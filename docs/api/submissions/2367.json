Just kidding. I didn\u2019t change my name. Did change my whole life around though.\n\nI wanted to post this update for a lot of reasons, but mainly to express my gratitude. I didn\u2019t have a lot of friends at the time and most of them were my boyfriend\u2019s friends. I truly didn\u2019t feel like I had anyone else to go to about this, so I\u2019m so thankful for everyone who took the time to reply to my original post and provide insight. It was a lot to sift through and honestly, really painful. It felt like I was finally being validated after years of gaslighting myself. I always had a feeling that something was wrong but pushed it aside for the sake of being part of the family. The period after I posted was truly one of the lowest of my life, but also one of the most empowering. \n\nA lot of people told me to cut out my boyfriend but I didn\u2019t see the point. I didn\u2019t understand the accusations of narcissism. But when I sat down with him, explained how badly him siding with my mom hurt me, how it hurt to watch him turn against me when I needed to support, his response was, \u201cYou did this to yourself.\u201d That was the lightbulb moment I needed. We broke up, I moved in with my brother for a little while to get back on my feet. \n\nThere were a lot of recommendations to go no contact with my mom, but I had a really hard time with the idea of it. Talking it over with her was mostly unsuccessful, she kept degrading herself and sending me all these backhanded apologies that made me feel worse. Everything ended in me apologizing.\n\nMy sister had her baby. Whole family went to visit her and she told us the name - top 10, very traditional. My mom made a comment about me scaring her out of exercising creativity, without any crocodile tears or hysterics. It was pure hostility from her and it was another lightbulb. I brushed it off, apologized to my sister, stuck around for another 30 minutes, and that was it. That was the last time I spoke to my mom. \n\nMy brother harassed me about it, so I moved out of his place and into an extended stay hotel. I got a job a few states away, got an apartment, packed up my life and pretty much entirely started over. I haven\u2019t spoken to any of my family members in almost a year. \n\nThere has been a lot of therapy, as recommended. It\u2019s been a painful, sad, lonely, and frustrating experience, but I\u2019m also so much better off. I have new friends, I actually like my job a lot better now, and I\u2019m creating my own weird little family with my pets, a family that I\u2019m really a part of.\n\nAgain, thank you to everyone who provided input.

Donald's children are Donald and Ronald.", "Good ole Dicky, the Ok-Scientist", "I was going through a few options like 'Honnie', 'Monnie', 'Nonnie' and decided that maybe Steve was the better option.", "I had a friend whose parents, when they got married, ended up having the same initials. So they named all four kids to have the same initials. Everyone's socks had their name on the foot so they all got their own socks back after laundry day.", "Oh man - I worked at a daycare years and years ago, and my absolute *favorite* was this adorable kid named Shaeon.\n\nI eventually found out that his dad\u2019s name was Shae, and he had six kids with two women, ALL of whom were named after him: Lashae, Shaelynn, Shaeon, Shae jr., etc.\n\nMost incredible, they all lived together (I guess it was some kind of polyamory situation, though the term was not really known at the time), and both women were BEAUTIFUL. Like, gorgeous professional women\u2026\n\nI always thought Shae must\u2019ve been a pretty incredible guy for them to be cool with being sisterwives and having all their kids named after him.", "Ah! I did forget Bonnie \ud83e\udd23", "My parents tried this, or at least I think my mom was going for it. But my dad was adamantly against any of the other names that would have started with that initial, so I avoided that theme. Thank god, because honestly, I am totally not a fan of the other names that were suggested for myself either."]}
