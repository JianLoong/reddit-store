Just kidding. I didn\u2019t change my name. Did change my whole life around though.\n\nI wanted to post this update for a lot of reasons, but mainly to express my gratitude. I didn\u2019t have a lot of friends at the time and most of them were my boyfriend\u2019s friends. I truly didn\u2019t feel like I had anyone else to go to about this, so I\u2019m so thankful for everyone who took the time to reply to my original post and provide insight. It was a lot to sift through and honestly, really painful. It felt like I was finally being validated after years of gaslighting myself. I always had a feeling that something was wrong but pushed it aside for the sake of being part of the family. The period after I posted was truly one of the lowest of my life, but also one of the most empowering. \n\nA lot of people told me to cut out my boyfriend but I didn\u2019t see the point. I didn\u2019t understand the accusations of narcissism. But when I sat down with him, explained how badly him siding with my mom hurt me, how it hurt to watch him turn against me when I needed to support, his response was, \u201cYou did this to yourself.\u201d That was the lightbulb moment I needed. We broke up, I moved in with my brother for a little while to get back on my feet. \n\nThere were a lot of recommendations to go no contact with my mom, but I had a really hard time with the idea of it. Talking it over with her was mostly unsuccessful, she kept degrading herself and sending me all these backhanded apologies that made me feel worse. Everything ended in me apologizing.\n\nMy sister had her baby. Whole family went to visit her and she told us the name - top 10, very traditional. My mom made a comment about me scaring her out of exercising creativity, without any crocodile tears or hysterics. It was pure hostility from her and it was another lightbulb. I brushed it off, apologized to my sister, stuck around for another 30 minutes, and that was it. That was the last time I spoke to my mom. \n\nMy brother harassed me about it, so I moved out of his place and into an extended stay hotel. I got a job a few states away, got an apartment, packed up my life and pretty much entirely started over. I haven\u2019t spoken to any of my family members in almost a year. \n\nThere has been a lot of therapy, as recommended. It\u2019s been a painful, sad, lonely, and frustrating experience, but I\u2019m also so much better off. I have new friends, I actually like my job a lot better now, and I\u2019m creating my own weird little family with my pets, a family that I\u2019m really a part of.\n\nAgain, thank you to everyone who provided input. Not exactly the happiest update, but one for the better.", "created_utc": 1668513608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvv410/update_aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_named_me_like/", "score": 953, "replies": ["What an uplifting update! \n\nI know it must have been incredibly difficult for you, but you should be so proud of yourself for taking such brave steps and building a better, happier life for yourself.", "Original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ol1oq6/aita_for_saying_my_mom_named_me_like_a_madlibs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "Oh wow.

I kind of vaguely remember your original post, and I remember I don\u2019t think I read past the first paragraph, because I thought this was satire shit post based on Joy luck club. As soon as I started reading further though, I can tell I would have certainly wondered why your boyfriend yelled at you and saying that made it awkward for him. I was like, what is your boyfriend and / or your brother? This was between you and your mom why would it have been awkward for your boyfriend.

But you are a truly strong person for no longer willing to put up with such toxicity from you mom, siblings, and BF (who I still don't understand why even needed to be involved with this whole thing).
