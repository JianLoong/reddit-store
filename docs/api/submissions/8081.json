Because I am like... almost 100% sure it's someone running a um.... lady of the night operation.... A few of the neighbors have already complained, that's how I was even made aware of the situation. I work from home but am not nosey so didn't realize. But now the blinders are off.\n\nThe woman who allegedly lives there pretty much NEVER leaves, so this doesn't feel like someone living there with a side hustle. It appears to be more like they are running a full time business. The neighbors said the once or twice they spotted her, she appeared to be Asian, which isn't uncommon for the area. Huge Asian/Indian/Middle Eastern community. There are random men (99% are caucasian aged 45-60 or so) coming and going all hours of the day. I was shocked to see these strange men hustling to their cars in guest parking in broad daylight every day. None of them have keys to unlock the door, they just walk in. \n\nI'm sex industry positive but my line of work (criminal justice) has shown me that that comes with dangers I do not wanna deal with in a residential area... I worry about someone trying to get into my house by mistake, or something going wrong with a poorly vetted client. I can also see the elementary school playground from my window, and they keep leaving condoms in the parking area.\n\nI hate the idea of forcing a sex worker into a more unsafe situation, they could be trafficked, I just don't know. All I know is all the cases I've worked on flash through my head and it stresses me out.\n\nThanks in advance for taking the time. I'm genuinely open to all opinions because I know how nuanced this is.\n\nEdit: I kind of regret posting this because the backlash has been pretty brutal and I'm a panicky sobby mess because I really was trying to figure out the right thing to do that would allow me to feel safe as well as her. \n\nI get it. I'm an asshole and a monster. If you'll excuse me, I'm just going to go fuck off and hope for the best...\n\nEdit 2: I'm no longer responding to comments guys. For all the wild leaps you're all pinning on me, all I'm seeing for the most part are insults and accusations that aren't really called for. No amount of me clarifying will help at this point. \n\nI'm not racist. I'm not a Karen. I'm not an idiot. I am truly happy for you all that you live somewhere that you feel so insulated from this stuff that you must assume I'm being dramatic. \n\nI have not spoken to management, I have not spoken to police, that wasn't even on the radar when I posted. But since taking a step back, I spoke directly to my other neighbor, the stay at home mom with the Ring, and she says on average there are men coming and going every 30-40 minutes. It has increased exponentially in the last month, and it was glaringly obvious even while I was off being blissfully unaware as I lived my life.\n\nI've also been made aware after texting my neighbors to my left that a strange man did bang on my door two weeks ago while I was out of town, and my Ring neighbor's husband had to come out to let him know that was the wrong house. The man promptly went into the door in question without a key. Ring neighbors have opted not to say anything because \"we have kids and we're afraid of retaliation.\" That's simply the area we live in, hence my fears. \n\nAs I've wracked my brain over this with all of you, I've also recalled an incident I now attribute to this situation. A man did knock on my door when I was home alone one night, but by the time I answered he was walking away. Thinking he was a lost grubhub driver, I asked if he needed help finding anything. He looked started, and walked around the block. It didn't wait to see where he ended up, but noticed 10 minutes later he was still lingering around near my neighbor's door. It was unnerving at the time, but I just assumed he was some nutter. \n\nMy memories can come and go because of my C-PTSD and concussions I've suffered, so I apologize for \"adding on later.\" It's not an attempt to make things up to fluff the story, things just sometimes come to you and have a different feel when you put things together. \n\nI will not be knocking on her door because if I'm right, and she's not alone, it leaves me vulnerable to attack or retaliation. I have no immediate plans to report, I don't like this anymore than you all do. But I don't want to make any further edits if I can help it.", "created_utc": 1674492553, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jh1x6/wibta_if_i_reported_my_townhouse_neighbor_for/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

An independent sex worker doing their own thing is not the same as a brothel or a strip club in terms of how it will affect the neighbourhood.\n\nIf you are worried she is trafficked, get to know her a little. Know that most people who are trafficked need options, not rescue, and many are 'trafficked' by choice due to economic need. They definitely don't need police called on them, to add criminalization to the list of problems.\n\nWhy do you think she is responsible for condoms in the parking area? Are they fucking in a car? I assume any sex work is happening in the townhouse, so condoms would end up there. Are these men walking out butt naked and ejecting the condoms into the parking lot? Are they removing the condom in the house, snuggling/showering/whatever for the rest of the appointment, then picking up the condom and walking past garbage bins to drop it in the parking lot??? What exactly is the logic here because I don't see it.\n\nWhat are you genuinely concerned about, OP? Are you worried about her welfare? Are you worried about property values?
