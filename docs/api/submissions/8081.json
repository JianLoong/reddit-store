An independent sex worker doing their own thing is not the same as a brothel or a strip club in terms of how it will affect the neighbourhood.\n\nIf you are worried she is trafficked, get to know her a little. Know that most people who are trafficked need options, not rescue, and many are 'trafficked' by choice due to economic need. They definitely don't need police called on them, to add criminalization to the list of problems.\n\nWhy do you think she is responsible for condoms in the parking area? Are they fucking in a car? I assume any sex work is happening in the townhouse, so condoms would end up there. Are these men walking out butt naked and ejecting the condoms into the parking lot?
