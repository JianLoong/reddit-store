Her fiance is 'Nate'. Me and Brit are very close, and the baby is also the first grandchild/nibling in our family so we've all been supporting her in whatever way we can.\n\nAt the end of February Nate went away for a few days to attend a family memorial. Brit asked him not to go, he insisted and went anyway. She went over to our parents during that time.\n\nSince he's gotten back Brit's pretty much ignoring and side eyeing him. He texted me a few days ago saying this is the situation and surely I can understand, and if I can talk to her because she refuses to talk to him.\n\nI told Nate it's not a surprise why she's ignoring him. He left his heavily pregnant partner even after she said not to go.\n\nNate replied we're all hurting him and he needs support too. I was blunt and said he's hurt because this is the truth - that he left Brit alone. I can understand it's bad timing, but they could've gone to visit his family after the baby was born. He chose not to compromise. Right now, Brit is the one that needs the most support and her biggest support should be him, her fiance and father of her child.\n\nI also said I'm not going to talk to Brit about this and she'll forgive him when she wants to. In the meantime, he should be doing everything he can to make it up to her.\n\nNate was upset and texted that I'm being harsh on him and not understanding of the situation.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678889698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rxny9/aita_for_refusing_to_talk_to_my_sister_about_her/", "score": 1968, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes she's heavily pregnant, but he also just lost someone close enough to him that he wanted to attend the memorial service for (who was it for btw? You left that out). While yes it's technically the truth what you told him, I feel there's more nuance here that you are overlooking, and both you and your sister are overreacting.", "Nate!

I'm sorry that funerals don't line up with your sense of timing. \nIf we were talking post 37 weeks, I could have said maybe esh. \n\nBut question... Did you encourage this behavior?

He's not wrong in saying you lot aren't being very supportive towards him.\n\nIf he needed to attend to grieve and say goodbye, then I'm sorry but even your pregnant partner shouldn't be saying no to that. Normally the partner should 100% go as well for support, even if they didn't personally know the deceased - however in your sister's condition I can understand why she couldn't go. I can't understand why she thinks he shouldn't go either, and dragging it on by ignoring him for weeks after. You don't mention she's had a very complicated pregnancy or anything like that, so it's probably been okay so far.\n\nAnd on top of that, your parents were around to help her out if needed. So what's the issue? You're telling him he needs to do everything to make it up to her? Because he literally went to a family memorial? No.\n\nAlso the fact you leave out who exactly this memorial is for solidifies YTA.

He lost someone, presumably important to him since he insisted on going to their memorial. Your sister isn't due for weeks.

He went to London (we're in the US) for the memorial, 4-5 days.

If she was due in literally days, ok yeah, Nate's a jerk for leaving, but she was 4 weeks from due, or thereabouts, and has great family support around if something did happen to cause a premature birth.\n\nAre you and your sister both so self-obsessed that you cannot be even slightly sympathetic to someone who just lost 2 family members? Why is it just his wife who needs the most support, and not the person who is grieving the loss of 2 people in his life, exactly? Because she's pregnant? Get off your high horse, being pregnant doesn't mean you always take priority over everything and everyone. If your sister actually cares about Nate, she'll realize that she's being irrational here and apologize for her behaviour. Blame pregnancy hormones if she needs to.\n\nEdit: What the actual fuck? I saw in comments that it was 2 family members before I responded, but reading further, I now see it was his *brother?!*  Jesus H OP, you really are the asshole, and so is your sister.

You guys are heartless and awful people.", "OMG you're all TA. This guy's brother DIED and you are so selfish that none of you can give him any compassion, kindness, or support?!?!?! Instead, she's throwing a silent tantrum because she didn't get her way, and you all are backing her on it?

You say you're close with your sister just for a second try to imagine if she died and then your partner said \"no don't go mourn them because it's slightly inconvenient to me.\" How would you feel? \n\nYou all need to get over yourselves, apologize, and hope he forgives you.", "He can only go to his brother\u2019s funeral one time.

Does she have complications? Because from my perspective, unless your sister was bedridden, she (and you) are being unreasonable saying he can\u2019t go to a family memorial.

Brit asked him not to go, he insisted and went anyway. She went over to our parents during that time.\n\nSince he's gotten back Brit's pretty much ignoring and side eyeing him. He texted me a few days ago saying this is the situation and surely I can understand, and if I can talk to her because she refuses to talk to him.\n\nI told Nate it's not a surprise why she's ignoring him. He left his heavily pregnant partner even after she said not to go.\n\nNate replied we're all hurting him and he needs support too. I was blunt and said he's hurt because this is the truth - that he left Brit alone. I can understand it's bad timing, but they could've gone to visit his family after the baby was born. He chose not to compromise. Right now, Brit is the one that needs the most support and her biggest support should be him, her fiance and father of her child.\n\nI also said I'm not going to talk to Brit about this and she'll forgive him when she wants to. In the meantime, he should be doing everything he can to make it up to her.\n\nNate was upset and texted that I'm being harsh on him and not understanding of the situation.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My grandmother passed away in my third trimester and I couldn't get the medical all clear for air travel to attend her funeral.", "Wow that\u2019s even sadder. Imagine losing your brother & cousin, then coming back home & being completely alienated because people are too close minded, over dramatic and completely selfish to think anyone else had feelings besides a pregnant lady throwing a tantrum when she\u2019s more than a month away from her due date. The sister seems like she\u2019s the type to take something like this so personal, she\u2019s willing to risk her health to die on a hill where she\u2019s gona die all alone. Wait! My bad, she has her whole family in on bullying the husband, so maybe it\u2019ll be the next Gettysburg and they\u2019ll all die on that hill together. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Selfish is the right word. \n\nOp YTA. Your sister is TA. I cannot believe anyone would put this poor man in this situation. I hope she likes the idea of being a single mom.", "Agreed. My god...  \n\n\nShe'll have her baby, and her family...he won't have his brother and cousin.   \n\n\nOP, and the family, except for \"Nate\" -- YTA big time!", "That it was a memorial for two family members together tends to suggest some sort of accident. Something where they're just gone. Not a long illness situation where you can prepare for it and say goodbyes.\n\nHe was absolutely going to want, really need, to be there to be with his family.\n\nThough, I'll say even if it was a long illness situation, it wouldn't change my opinion OP and her sister are TAs.", "Yeah.  It really does.", "Yah and selfishness makes a terrible mother.", "Yeah, it is.  It makes this post feel even more sad just understanding how Nate must feel", "Oof!  He's definitely TA!", "You're the Ahole- YTA\n\nNot the Ahole- N T A\n\nEveryone Sucks Here- E S H\n\nNo Assholes Here- N A H\n\nThe spaces keep it from counting as a vote so no spaces if that's how you're voting", "What the previous commenter meant was that you cast your judgement by using a judgement acronym in a top-level comment.\n\nThat means that you make a comment to the original post (comments on other people's comments only count as discussion) with one of YTA (you're the asshole), NTA (not the asshole), ESH (everybody sucks here), or NAH (no assholes here) at the top of your comment. Those are the four judgements available.  At the end of a set period (8 or so hours, I think?) the community bot rolls through, looks at the most popular comment, and takes the judgement on that comment to set the flair for the post, making the judgement official.\n\nEdit: if you have any further questions, the community has quite a good FAQs.", "It\u2019s either YTA (you\u2019re the asshole), N T A (not the asshole) There is also no one is the asshole and everyone is the asshole which is E T A or N T A H (I\u2019m putting spaces between them because I don\u2019t want them being counted for voting on this one but they don\u2019t typically have spaces", "You\u2019re right. Pretty sure we all know that, I just really really wish it wasn\u2019t the case and someone would just give the damn man a hug.", "Right! If my sibling did some shit like this I would tell them they\u2019re being a straight asshole! Loving someone also means telling them when they\u2019re wrong in situations and how stupid they look.", "Yeah... 32 weeks is borderline for flying imo\n\nBut like... barely. I was *encouraged* to fly cross country (by my doctor) at 30 weeks, lol.\n\n\"Go get some clean air, see some sights before you can't for awhile. Have a mental health boost, you're going to need it!\" sort of things. \n\nObviously it wasn't for a funeral, but yeah...", "okay, but can we all be in agreement that maybe she couldn't go, but he absolutely had to go, and with her full support.", "To be fair, here in the UK would be a great place to have an accidental birth.

And this is why my husband calls me a boomer.\ud83d\ude06", "Me too.  My dog died last Monday, and I'm struggling with grief and mourning, which are physical processes that have noticeable biological effects.  This guy lost one of the most important relationships in any human life, the relationship that should be longest in your life: your relationship with a sibling.  My mother's sister was murdered over 40 years ago and we suffer that loss still.   And this pair of absolute b!tches won't even acknowledge that pain and trauma because something something 8 months pregnant.  Poor, poor Nate.", "Oh absolutely, 32 weeks is far enough away from the due date to be totally fine with family helping her unless there's something we don't know about her pregnancy. Heck at 33 weeks with my second (who was a high risk of early delivery pregnancy, they didn't think I'd even make it to 36 weeks, but somehow made it to 41+3, all the doctors in the maternity clinic were surprised to see me at my weekly checkups) I was installing new laminate flooring in the nursery.", "Hard to say as the NHS won't cover non-citizens and if they can't get travel insurance to cover it, they would be on the hook for everything, especially at 32 weeks it would mean a NICU stay.

Is this the same story from another angle?", "Damn nice callback.", "Legit thought of that post, too!", "Yeah that one was just nuts, much like this one", "I only got on Reddit last year and had to learn too.
