{"id": 25850, "submission_id": "165c3kk", "title": "AITA for calling my SIL an attention whore after she announced her pregnancy", "selftext": "Disclaimer: this is my first time using Reddit after a friend recommended it to me so please bear w me if I don't know all the correct language!\n\nAbout a week ago, me (24f), my brother Jack (26m), my dad, and some other close family members went on a trip to Tunisia, where my mother, who died in a car accident about two years ago, was from to discover a little more about her life and our ancestors. On this trip, my brother decided to bring his wife, Julie (26f) and I brought my husband. Up till now, I had not had any issues with Julie as I don't know her very well (she and my brother met and got married during COVID and live quite far so I had only seen her 2 or 3 times before this trip). \n\nSo, the incident occurred on the second to last day of the trip when we all went out to dinner. I think that it is important to note that this whole trip was to remember and celebrate my mother (she died around the beginning of COVID where I live so we didn't get a proper funeral for her), and the day we went out to dinner was her birthday.\n\nAt the beginning of the dinner, my dad said a short speech basically thanking everyone for coming and honouring my mother's life. Before he even got the chance to sit down, Julie stood up and announced that her and Jack are expecting a baby! The entire table went silent, with only a few quiet congratulations. Instead of reading the room and sitting back down, Julie ran up to me with a big obnoxious grin and asked me if I was excited to be an auntie. I stayed silent, trying not to ruin what was the left of this trainwreck of a dinner and she said that she was just trying to lighten the mood with some good news. This is when I cracked and yelled at her that she wasn't trying to benefit anyone but herself and that she was a selfish attention whore. I walked out, followed by my husband and then my dad. From what I gather, the dinner was pretty much ruined after that and the whole family had left before they ordered any food. \n\nNow, I do understand that she could have seen it as was a good opportunity as the entire family was all together, but after talking with my brother I found out that they had known for a month before the trip so they could easily have announced it before. My dad is staying neutral on this and my brother is angry at me for 'embarrassing' his wife but understands my point of view. Some family members and Julie's mom are now calling me a bitch over text for ruining an important moment for her. So, am I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit: to answer some questions: my brother said that they had spoken about announcing it to my family but had no idea she was going to do it at that time. I don't know for sure who sent Julie's mom my number but based on evidence I think I can assume it's Julie. I have sent the screenshots of messages I have received to my brother and blocked them. \n\nThank you for all the insightful comments of support (and not so much support), I will be going over to Julie's house (2h45 away, far for me but not impossible) to talk things through and may post an update based on how it goes.", "created_utc": 1693395026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165c3kk/aita_for_calling_my_sil_an_attention_whore_after/", "score": 4082, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was the first chance your whole family had to come together and mourn. It was a memorial. Your father had barely finished a speech memorialising his wife - practically a eulogy - and your SIL immediately leapt up.\n\nAt the very least, she is utterly inept at reading social cues. I can't understand what possible part of her thought this was the perfect time to announce a pregnancy. At worst, she is what you said: selfish and desperate for attention.\n\nYou don't owe her an apology. You were quiet until she targeted you specifically with demands of excitement. She precipitated every part of this interaction and the fact that it backfired so spectacularly is on her, not you. She ruined your mother's memorial. She owes you the apology. Tell your brother exactly that, and warn him about how his in-laws are bullying you for shutting down her disgraceful behaviour. Their callous attitude doesn't bode well for his future.", "No you didn\u2019t get a funeral for your mom. This was it. All family was there to remember her to love her.

An now that grieving that everyone was trying to do is ruined", "Was Julie aware that this trip was to be a memorial one for your mother? \n\nIf she was very well aware, then definitely you showed her the mirror.\n\nThere is time and place for everything.

This trip was in her memory and the dinner was on her birthday - Julie announcing a pregnancy and expecting everyone to be jumping for joy after a solemn and I expect emotional speech by your dad was totally out of line.   At that moment you were feeling sad and remembering your mother - not only did this attention seeker announce her pregnancy she then continued to ignore what must have been an obviously muted reaction to come to you and go on about being an aunt. \n\nYour reaction was emotional - I wouldn\u2019t have maintained my cool at that moment either - I think I also would have walked away - I would not have been able to sit down again with that fool of a woman trying to make the moment all about her.\n\nEdit typo", "NTA. This was the funeral of your mother not a family dinner.", "NTA. You were in the process of grieving and that was self ration of your mom. Your SIL clearly misread the situation. Did you overreact - yes but people react differently when they are grieving. Is you SIL an A - yes. She purposefully chose that moment to announce and while it maybe with good intentions it was not her place to force herself into family event", "NTA.  \nGood thing you know you can't invite her anywhere anymore.  \nBe sure to also not nanny for her.", "I still don't understand why people think they can give out your number to people who want to berate you.  Block those people or change your number.  She just became the BIGGER AH when she did that.", "NTA, in the heat of the moment this set you over the top, you lost your cool, you left as did others. You were not the only one that felt this was out of line, other felt it was. A difference of opinion.", "Nta. Seems a little trashy IMO", "Oof\n\nNTA I don't think announcing a pregnancy during a memorial dinner has come up before because most people just have a little switch in their brain that flips and tells them \"wow, that be freaking weird to announce that now, huh\"", "NTA. She ruined a memorial dinner for your mother.\n\nHer baby announcement should've taken place before or after the trip but definitely not your mom's birthday", "NTA", "NTA. You didn't yelled at her at first. You did after she failed to read the room and tried to push it on you and your family. \n\nYes it could have been a nice gesture of her in this setting. But after a few days with you she should have known better than to try to take the spotlight of this tragic loss away to her good news.\n\nBut maybe appologice. Maybe July is not good with social interactions. You only meet her a few times, so it sounds like she doesn't know you all that well. And as said, if the situation was different, with different people such good news could have been what she expected - a happy mood changer. Maybe she tried to find the right moment for the whole trip, and as it was the last evening all together, she just couldn't hold it any longer. She wanted to have her moment and chose the very wrong timing with your family. So she lost this moment as much as you lost the moment of this dinner. It doesn't help anyone to stay angry. Try to appologice to her, congratulate her and your brother and if the mood is right, try to explain, why it was the wrong timing, but that you are willing - if they want - to help to organise something special - maybe for the baby shower or gender reveal party. So she will have her moment in a situation which is all about her and the baby.", "NTA", "I fucking love that people bring these disasters to the internet to get the final input. How will you tally this? Will you do any sentiment analysis? I know a guy.", "ESH.\n\nJulie was wrong for announcing her baby need at a dreadful time that was supposed to be dedicated to your late mother who your family recently lost. \n\nYou are clearly still grieving for your mother (understandable as it\u2019s only been 2 years since she died), and are of course still very emotional about it. Julie ruined a trip that you had planned to honour your mother, by spouting her baby news at a really bad time when it was l supposed to be your late mothers birthday dinner. \n\nI think you were unhappy and angry at her for this which is completely understandable. But I think your issue was calling her a \u201cselfish w****\u201d. I think instead, you should have stayed silent during the meal and told Julie afterwards that this was not acceptable. Or, you could have quietly told her at the table that this is not the time since she kept trying to go on about it. \n\nI think you\u2019re less than an AH than Julie personally, but I suppose I\u2019ll get downvoted for all of this \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Imagine calling someone a whore over that, you're not a complete victim here, the situation could've been handled better. ESH", "I think this was a knee jerk reaction & y\u2019all just took it too far.\n\nIf the day was meant to be about your mother then news of a pending child would have been news she probably would have been very excited about. It appears y\u2019all actually made it about yourselves.\n\nIf you wanted the day to be a solemn moment then don\u2019t include other people. Everyone grieves in their own way. There\u2019s no etiquette for a memorial dinner. However, I do think SIL\u2019s timing was a little off. Your father had just spoken so everyone needed a moment to acknowledge their loss. \n\nYour reaction to your SIL was unkind & unnecessary. At worst this was just a faux pas. She had no intent to hurt anyone. You on the other hand wanted to hurt her.\n\nESH\n\neta \u2014 has it occurred to you that just may have been about Julie being nervous? If you have ever attended a wake or funeral or memorial service people often say crazy things because they don\u2019t know what to say. Julie did absolutely nothing to ruin the memory of your mother. Hopefully, y\u2019all can resolve your issues & think back on that day with a laugh.", "Softly YTA I get it was an emotional time for you all, but why not finish the trip off with some lovely news. She maybe thought this would give people something to get excited about.", "YTA. Why the dramatics? What did she do wrong? What's wrong with some happy news?

Poor girl just wanted to share good news with the family, and you guys overreacted and attacked her.", "ESH. She read the room wrong, surely not on purpose. Your attack was far too harsh.", "YTA, I also think your family who shamed your SIL are also arseholes.

I cannot understand why your family would get mad. This was a celebration together. This seemed like a perfect moment to announce **the good news**.

You were honoring your mother life, not mourning her death. I understand symbolism of timing to announce that your mother's legacy continues and they are having her grandchild.", "Tough call for me, but I\u2019ll lean towards YTA. Unless something else is missing, she is family and this was a family trip. Understanding that it was to honor your deceased mother, but a new addition to the family sounds like a wonderful blessing. Could she have chosen a better time to announce? Sounds like it. But I have to ask, is every anniversary of mothers passing and/or her birthday going forward mean that no one can ever say anything good about their lives? I know you are grieving but a new family meme we should be a blessing. What would your mother have thought about being a grandma? I wonder if the pain of your loss is overshadowing the joy you should be feeling? Condolences on the loss of your mother. I hope you can find it in your heart to welcome Julie into the family since your entire post is worded like you still haven\u2019t accepted her yet.

What would have been remembered as an awkwardly timed announcement is going to be remembered as the night you may have irreparably damaged your relationship with your SIL and brother.\n\n3.) A more minor point, and again this doesn't take away from the fact that her timing was poor, but this was a multi-day trip. Were you guys literally talking about your mom that entire time and no one allowed to talk about anything pertaining to themselves or something else? I'm sure there were other moments where you guys talked about other stuff. This on was the second to last day of the trip and you were all having dinner together as a family, she could have read the room better yes but I don't think its so insanely outlandish she thought it was an appropriate time to share family news.\n\nI want to stress again is that this was family, someone who will be in your life a long time. What she did wasn't okay but there are better ways to have handled it if it really was so upsetting such as privately mentioning it to her after dinner when you guys are back from the trip or any number of ways. I understand you are grieving and that things were stressful but I think it would be better to at least try to have a good relationship with this person instead of shunning her from the family and berating her for again what is a very awkward but not intentionally malevolent thing she did.", "I let my husband announcement our pregnancy to his family. Yes they're my family too, but I felt that since it's his kid too, he might want to share in the excitement of telling loved ones as I did with my family.

She also waited until one of the last days of the trip to say this, probably out of respect for your family and to not take away from the purpose of the trip.  If she truly was an attention whore, she would've announced it on day 1 and would have made the entire trip about her pregnancy.\n\nShe probably lacked the tact to pull it off gracefully but in her mind, she probably thought you would all appreciate hearing the news while you're together as a family rather than on the phone.

She did not.

His wife didn't call me a whore for mentioning the deaths of both my parents the previous year since we couldn't have funerals for them.  He didn't try to turn the rest of the family against his sister who announced her pregnancy, not did he question the right of the new additions through marriage (and one adoption) to be present as he'd only met them a couple times before (because, again, COVID.)  They even lit memorial candles for those who had passed and were not there.   I think we discussed, all in all, ten deaths, four marriages, a couple engagements, three births and seven pregnancies.  (We're a big family and hadn't all got together in a LOONG time, so what can I say.) Granted, to be fair, none of us were as absolutely tone-deaf as the the SIL here and chose more appropriate moments to bring up our news, but responding the way OP did would have been inconceivable under any circumstances. \n\nThe bridal party was so excited to hear about the new babies because we're a family, dammit,  and love each other enough to rejoice in someone else's good news.

I personally think, considering the SIL waited until the end of the trip, and the sheer fact it's been two years, the response from OP is really just her projecting her own hurt feelings that life has moved for others, something everyone dealing with serious grief has felt.

OP didn't like the timing. OP overreacted.  Is this really her hill to die on? Possibly excluding herself from brother and baby's life because she didn't like the time of an announcement?

She chose that moment to take focus off the reason you were all there and put it on here and tye fact she doubled down after the silence and ran to you for validation proves that she wanted that moment taken off her MIL and be about her instead.", "I mean surely it depends on how the speech was.  Ive seen remembrance speeches where it's quiet and somber and I've seen speeches where it ends with a big cheers like in memory of so and so because they wouldn't want us to be somber.

I know that my family members would have loved it, and would have felt that the greatest honor and most delightful end of the trip was a baby. Especially if the baby was named after the late mother. No one in my family would have wanted an entire trip of mourning, unless it was a \u201cMarch of the living\u201d style auschwitz visit.", "I think the fact that we have March of the living is why we culturally can celebrate joy with death.

You could\u2019ve just ignored her and said \u201cthat\u2019s great congrats- but this trip is about celebrating our mom. Let\u2019s all share memories of her\u201d. I could see her believing that the dinner table was a time for you all to get together, bond and get to know each other. I get that this was a memorial dinner, but it\u2019s not like she stood up in a funeral and after everyone said their goodbyes she she screamed out that she\u2019s expecting, it was a dinner table full of family at a restaurant on a vacation made to commemorate your mother and bring the family together to learn about her heritage..", "YTA. \n\nWhat would your mother have thought about this news? Would it have made her happy? I have to imagine it would have.", "YTA. Your reaction was unhinged and if I was Julie, I wouldn\u2019t let you anywhere near my child.

This baby is your mother\u2019s grandchild! Waiting until the end of the trip to share some good news which also continues on your mother\u2019s line and legacy does not take away from her, in fact it does quite the opposite. YTA", "YTA. There are no rule books for these things and a baby is often a silver lining in grief of loss. She doesn't know your family well and may have misjudged the situation but it sounds you were the one who was inappropriate here.", "Damn.\n\nyou, your husband, and your dad are sensitive", "Explain why this was wrong?\n\nWas it a funeral type / dead mom memorial?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>family members went on a trip to Tunisia, where my mother, who died in a car accident about two years ago, was from to discover a little more about her life and our ancestors  \n>  \n>I think that it is important to note that this whole trip was to remember and celebrate my mother", "YTA. Julia very well could have thought that her being pregnant was a kind of circle of life thing that would bring hope in a sad time. Very very easily, you have just said, \u201ccongratulations!\u201d And moved on. You\u2019re the one who blew it up. \nDon\u2019t yell at people and storm out of rooms. That\u2019s so childish. You sound like a Real Housewife. \n\nAlso, congrats on becoming an aunt.", "YTA\n\nShe and your brother waited until the end of the trip to tell everyone the news. If she had truly wanted to make it all about her, she would've told the news at the beginning and lavished in the praise the entire trip.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, I have sympathy for you and your loss. I truly do. But you were the attention seeker here. You are the one who blew your lid, name called like a child, and ruined the dinner for everyone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mom gaining a grandchild is absolutely something to celebrate. And it IS about your mom. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would recommend you apologize and try to repair your relationship with your SIL, even if her choice of time wasn't exactly the best for the announcement. You've ruined a precious moment for a new mom. Her very first baby announcement and her family screamed at her and called her names. I can't imagine it would be easy to keep a relationship with your brother and her if you don't apologize and talk to her about your feelings.", "lol 100% YTA. There is nothing, zero, zilch wrong with sharing good news during this trip. It didn't ruin the entire trip, the trip was a lot more than that one moment. You ruined that dinner IMO, by making a scene and being angry that someone else has a life outside of what's important to you at that moment. Moreover, people are very capable of feeling both thoughtful and respectful for a missed relative, and also happy for new good news. We can handle various emotional situations at once. I mean, most emotionally intelligent people can. I'd be embarrassed for your behaviour and I'd apologize to your SIL who has no ill intentions.", "ok I'm going to go with NAH, because it seems that while Julie knew this trip was in honor of your mother she seems to have interpreted it more as a celebration of life that a memorial recognizing her death. She seemed to think this was more a joyous family get together than a somber one, and thus that it'd be a good time to announce that there was going to be more life born into the family. I think she just read the room wrong. \n\nHowever you also were very upset that a touching moment with your family was ruined by a harsh tone shift. It's understandable that this would have been upsetting for you as the loss of your mother was in the front of your mind. \n\nI think best case scenario is that Julie apologies for misreading the tone of the trip and you apologize for loosing your temper at her so intensively.", "Yep, you are the asshole. You made it all about you when you yelled at her. You could have quietly just said congrats and went about your night, but you for sure took any chance of getting back on topic and making it about your mom away.", "I think you were an ass.  I get that this was a memorial for your mom, but what a better memorial to your mom than to celebrate a new life, a new life that is part of your Mom.  I can appreciate the emotions, but if you decide to have kids, you will likely wait three months to say anything.  Calling her names was just an asshole thing to do.  You said it was second to last day of the trip, so for several days it was about remembering your mom and her culture.  Does she make it a thing to upstage?  Is this a habit, or was this first time?  Probably wasn\u2019t great timing, in retrospect, but it was not evil.  And you treated it as if she insulted your mom, which she didn\u2019t.  I bet your mom would have been thrilled to have a baby on the way.", "YTA. I know grief is difficult and you were upset, but name calling and stomping off is inappropriate behavior for an adult. SIL didn't spoil the evening, you did. I would apologize, not just to SIL, but to everyone that was at the dinner.", "ESH . They could've waited a few days to announce, but you and your family's reaction is extreme. You all sound like insufferable people to be honest. Piling on a person like this is not going to bring your mother back and it looks like it's going to cause an unnecessary rift in the family. You all should have just quickly congratulated them and moved on talking about your mother.", "YTA a new life at the time of a death is a consolation. Celebrate family. All your family. Your mom would have been happy to know she had a grand child on the way.", "YTA - immature \n\nWhat would your mom want? She would be happy to find out she is having a grandchild.\n\nThere is nothing bad about her announcement and as you said they live far away and what is a better celebration of your mom but find out she is a grandmother. \n\nWhat was memorial of your mom supposed to look like - everybody sitting around with a frown on their face? I understand if she got drunk and was nasty to everyone but she just told good news and not only good news of her getting a promotion or new boobs, but a new addition to your family.", "NTA", "Yta sorry but your mom's been dead for a 3 ish years. Poor timing on her part perhaps but you definitely overreacted", "YTA, so your family went on a multi day trip together to remember your late mother. Your brothers partner tells everyone you\u2019re going to have a niece or nephew and you freaked out and called her names and ruined a perfectly good dinner. I honestly don\u2019t understand why you were upset. It seems like a natural time to announce such a thing. Are you jealous?", "You are the asshole.", "nah you aint the asshole she finna deserved that bullshit", "Especially announcing it on the birthday, my grandma was still alive when they were announced- one on Mother\u2019s Day and another on her birthday and both times she was elated and it was the best gift ever\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m sure the SIL thought if MIL was still around she would have the same reaction. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that feelings were soured over this- because I do believe if OP\u2019s mom was still around, she would\u2019ve been just as happy with the gift of being a grandma as my grandma was.", "I feel like OP saying to the in laws \u201chow dare she announce her pregnancy at my mothers funeral\u201d would be appropriate here", "THIS.", "I never made an judgment about who was an asshole.", "In fairness it could be asked how well did OPs husband know her mom? Considering they're younger and mom passed a couple of years ago, they might not have been super bonded either. It's completely unfair to treat in laws like they don't belong and try to gate keep family events.", "If this trip was one big pity party I feel for SIL, even when her timing wasn't great. Being surrounded by melancholy makes one naturally want to lift spirits and through OP mother her son, and now grandchild, part of her lives on  another generation.", "I disagree. That was selfish and rude and I\u2019ll-times and took away from the purpose of the gathering. \n\nImagine that you didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to your mother in the way you wanted to. \n\nYou finally get the chance to come together to celebrate and remember (and grieve together) and without even giving anyone a moment to respond to what has been said, you (for whatever reason) elbow your way into a solemn moment with news that could have been shared so many other times. \n\nOnce again, the opportunity to perform the ritual and say goodbye and complete her life with you has been stolen. \n\nShe\u2019s not an AH. \nShe was hurting. Angry. Exasperated. Emotionally raw. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make her an AH.", "God forbid people not comport themselves perfectly while grieving. Jesus fucking Christ.", "How would your mother have felt about how it was announced? She was clearly a good mother, given her whole family took a trip in her memory. Surely she would want you to celebrate her grandchild?", "Your mom is gaining a grandchild. I'm not sure how that's dishonoring to her.", "This is THE event where family members all got together to honour a dearly departed loved one. Therefore it is a funeral. Dad gave a eulogy thanking everyone for coming. \n\nThis literally is the funeral. Not all funerals look the same, or happen on the same schedule.", "I would have drank heavily.  No crying and baby gifts.  Great combo at a memorial.  Nope.  Sorry your relatives are apparently crazy and that\u2019s how they want to remember welcoming their child.", "Memorial time!  Guess what?? I\u2019m pregnant!  Turn those frowns upside down!  Time to jump for joy!", "But she is also carrying a family member who is the grandchild of that late family member. Lots of families would welcome this news at this very moment as being the perfect way to end the trip & to honour & remember the mother in a way that signals hope for the future for them all.\n\n SIL severely misjudged this but without malice.", "Absolutely this.  OP, YTA, but to be honest the entire family seems fucked up.\n\nYou've had two years and a full week of mawkish moping to deal with your mother's death, at some point you have to move on - I can see how a perfectly normally adjusted human being might think the last night of the mopathon was actually a very good time to close that chapter and move on with some good news.  It's the circle of life and all that...\n\nOne would like to think the mother would not have been \"how dare you upstage me on my birthday\" at the announcement of a grandchild coming - I would expect her to be delighted... And I genuinely can't fathom a father not also being delighted at that news.\n\n\nOP, stop wallowing, and start considering that being bereaved - two years ago FFS - does not give you personal license to be the centre of attention forever.  And please let's not pretend it's the mother that was meant to be the centre of attention here, the dead don't give a rat's arse - this is the family engaging in pro-celebrity performative grief whoring. Being bereaved doesn't make you special - everyone who lives long enough loses their parents eventually - and the world isn't going to stop turning for your benefit.", "Yes! We don\u2019t do somber weeks away and then think someone isn\u2019t allowed to have good news at a family occasion. Honestly you could announce a pregnancy at a wake and everyone would be happy for you", "Exactly. She's just the wife of the deceased woman's son, carrying their first grandchild but whatever.", "So sorry about that, I find it insane that people are even able to relate to this situation. It's a crazy world out there, stay safe.", "This is a good point. I don't think that Julie is going to be apologizing any time soon considering that it was probably her who gave out my number to her mom and other people...", "You always have a choice in your actions.    \nShe made an awkward announcement but you ruined the dinner and canceled a night of remembrance for your mother with that tantrum.", "\"Sorry for what I said but you left me no choice\" is not a real apology. If this is how you're going about it, prepare to never meet this child.", "I didn't know her very well at this point so can't make any assumptions but she seems perfectly normal during conversations we had had previously. I think it was probably a mistake in terms of timing but not sitting back down again and continuing to push us after seeing the response is what pissed me off.", "This is great, exactly what I would have expected from Julie. My husband only knew my mom for about a year, maybe less but he found a way to make polite conversation about her.", "And Julia here is pregnant with the deceased's grandchild.", "But he isn't a blood relation so he doesn't count. According to you that is.", "The speech was definitely the first type. My dad is a quiet person and doesn't share his feelings often which is why her practically interrupting him made it even worse timing.", "My husband only knew my mom for a year, maybe less. I brought him for emotional support and because he is my husband, probably the same reasons my brother brought Julie."]}
