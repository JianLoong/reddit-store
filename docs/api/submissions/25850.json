On this trip, my brother decided to bring his wife, Julie (26f) and I brought my husband. Up till now, I had not had any issues with Julie as I don't know her very well (she and my brother met and got married during COVID and live quite far so I had only seen her 2 or 3 times before this trip). \nSo, the incident occurred on the second to last day of the trip when we all went out to dinner. I think that it is important to note that this whole trip was to remember and celebrate my mother (she died around the beginning of COVID where I live so we didn't get a proper funeral for her), and the day we went out to dinner was her birthday.\nAt the beginning of the dinner, my dad said a short speech basically thanking everyone for coming and honouring my mother's life. Before he even got the chance to sit down, Julie stood up and announced that her and Jack are expecting a baby! The entire table went silent, with only a few quiet congratulations. Instead of reading the room and sitting back down, Julie ran up to me with a big obnoxious grin and asked me if I was excited to be an auntie. I stayed silent, trying not to ruin what was the left of this trainwreck of a dinner and she said that she was just trying to lighten the mood with some good news. This is when I cracked and yelled at her that she wasn't trying to benefit anyone but herself and that she was a selfish attention whore. I walked out, followed by my husband and then my dad. From what I gather, the dinner was pretty much ruined after that and the whole family had left before they ordered any food. \nNow, I do understand that she could have seen it as was a good opportunity as the entire family was all together, but after talking with my brother I found out that they had known for a month before the trip so they could easily have announced it before. My dad is staying neutral on this and my brother is angry at me for 'embarrassing' his wife but understands my point of view. Some family members and Julie's mom are now calling me a bitch over text for ruining an important moment for her.

This was the first chance your whole family had to come together and mourn. It was a memorial. Your father had barely finished a speech memorialising his wife - practically a eulogy - and your SIL immediately leapt up.\n\nAt the very least, she is utterly inept at reading social cues. I can't understand what possible part of her thought this was the perfect time to announce a pregnancy. At worst, she is what you said: selfish and desperate for attention.\n\nYou don't owe her an apology. You were quiet until she targeted you specifically with demands of excitement. She precipitated every part of this interaction and the fact that it backfired so spectacularly is on her, not you. She ruined your mother's memorial. She owes you the apology. Tell your brother exactly that, and warn him about how his in-laws are bullying you for shutting down her disgraceful behaviour. Their callous attitude doesn't bode well for his future.", "No you didn\u2019t get a funeral for your mom. This was it. All family was there to remember her to love her. You don\u2019t go to someone\u2019s funeral an right in the middle stand up an say your pregnant it rude. She wasn\u2019t considerate of everyone she wanted the attention. An now that grieving that everyone was trying to do is ruined", "Was Julie aware that this trip was to be a memorial one for your mother? \n\nIf she was very well aware, then definitely you showed her the mirror.\n\nThere is time and place for everything. She could've announced before or after the trip too. Say on the way home. I know everyone has gathered so it's easier but as a 26 yr old I expect more maturity \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Her announcement didn't make people jump in joy and excitement. So obviously everyone weren't looking for something to lighten the mood.\n\nI am glad your brother understands but what else Julie expect after announcing pregnancy during memorial dinner?\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA your mother died during covid which would have been even more awful as you couldn\u2019t have a funeral.  This trip was in her memory and the dinner was on her birthday - Julie announcing a pregnancy and expecting everyone to be jumping for joy after a solemn and I expect emotional speech by your dad was totally out of line.   At that moment you were feeling sad and remembering your mother - not only did this attention seeker announce her pregnancy she then continued to ignore what must have been an obviously muted reaction to come to you and go on about being an aunt. \n\nYour reaction was emotional - I wouldn\u2019t have maintained my cool at that moment either - I think I also would have walked away - I would not have been able to sit down again with that fool of a woman trying to make the moment all about her.\n\nEdit typo", "NTA. This was the funeral of your mother not a family dinner.", "NTA. You were in the process of grieving and that was self ration of your mom. Your SIL clearly misread the situation. Did you overreact - yes but people react differently when they are grieving. Is you SIL an A - yes. She purposefully chose that moment to announce and while it maybe with good intentions it was not her place to force herself into family event", "NTA.  \nGood thing you know you can't invite her anywhere anymore.  \nBe sure to also not nanny for her.", "I still don't understand why people think they can give out your number to people who want to berate you.  Block those people or change your number.  She just became the BIGGER AH when she did that.", "NTA, in the heat of the moment this set you over the top, you lost your cool, you left as did others. You were not the only one that felt this was out of line, other felt it was. A difference of opinion.", "Nta. Seems a little trashy IMO", "Oof\n\nNTA I don't think announcing a pregnancy during a memorial dinner has come up before because most people just have a little switch in their brain that flips and tells them \"wow, that be freaking weird to announce that now, huh\"", "NTA. She ruined a memorial dinner for your mother.\n\nHer baby announcement should've taken place before or after the trip but definitely not your mom's birthday", "NTA", "NTA. You didn't yelled at her at first. You did after she failed to read the room and tried to push it on you and your family. \n\nYes it could have been a nice gesture of her in this setting. But after a few days with you she should have known better than to try to take the spotlight of this tragic loss away to her good news.\n\nBut maybe appologice. Maybe July is not good with social interactions. You only meet her a few times, so it sounds like she doesn't know you all that well. And as said, if the situation was different, with different people such good news could have been what she expected - a happy mood changer. Maybe she tried to find the right moment for the whole trip, and as it was the last evening all together, she just couldn't hold it any longer. She wanted to have her moment and chose the very wrong timing with your family. So she lost this moment as much as you lost the moment of this dinner. It doesn't help anyone to stay angry. Try to appologice to her, congratulate her and your brother and if the mood is right, try to explain, why it was the wrong timing, but that you are willing - if they want - to help to organise something special - maybe for the baby shower or gender reveal party. So she will have her moment in a situation which is all about her and the baby.", "NTA", "I fucking love that people bring these disasters to the internet to get the final input. How will you tally this? Will you do any sentiment analysis? I know a guy.", "ESH.\n\nJulie was wrong for announcing her baby need at a dreadful time that was supposed to be dedicated to your late mother who your family recently lost. \n\nYou are clearly still grieving for your mother (understandable as it\u2019s only been 2 years since she died), and are of course still very emotional about it. Julie ruined a trip that you had planned to honour your mother, by spouting her baby news at a really bad time when it was l supposed to be your late mothers birthday dinner. \n\nI think you were unhappy and angry at her for this which is completely understandable. But I think your issue was calling her a \u201cselfish w****\u201d. I think instead, you should have stayed silent during the meal and told Julie afterwards that this was not acceptable. Or, you could have quietly told her at the table that this is not the time since she kept trying to go on about it. \n\nI think you\u2019re less than an AH than Julie personally, but I suppose I\u2019ll get downvoted for all of this \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Imagine calling someone a whore over that, you're not a complete victim here, the situation could've been handled better. ESH", "I think this was a knee jerk reaction & y\u2019all just took it too far.\n\nIf the day was meant to be about your mother then news of a pending child would have been news she probably would have been very excited about. It appears y\u2019all actually made it about yourselves.\n\nIf you wanted the day to be a solemn moment then don\u2019t include other people. Everyone grieves in their own way. There\u2019s no etiquette for a memorial dinner. However, I do think SIL\u2019s timing was a little off. Your father had just spoken so everyone needed a moment to acknowledge their loss. \n\nYour reaction to your SIL was unkind & unnecessary. At worst this was just a faux pas. She had no intent to hurt anyone. You on the other hand wanted to hurt her.\n\nESH\n\neta \u2014 has it occurred to you that just may have been about Julie being nervous? If you have ever attended a wake or funeral or memorial service people often say crazy things because they don\u2019t know what to say. Julie did absolutely nothing to ruin the memory of your mother. Hopefully, y\u2019all can resolve your issues & think back on that day with a laugh.", "Softly YTA I get it was an emotional time for you all, but why not finish the trip off with some lovely news. She maybe thought this would give people something to get excited about.", "YTA. Why the dramatics? What did she do wrong? What's wrong with some happy news? I don't get why you were so mean or why you guys threw tantrums and left. You all sound horrible. Poor girl just wanted to share good news with the family, and you guys overreacted and attacked her.", "ESH. She read the room wrong, surely not on purpose. Your attack was far too harsh.", "YTA, I also think your family who shamed your SIL are also arseholes. Expanding your family is joyful and wonderful news, I feel terrible for your brother and SIL to get such a disgraceful response from your \u201cfamily\u201d.", "Soft YTA. \nI get the moment was completly wrong, she should'nt had do it, and someone shoud've told her. It was the way you talked to her. It was over the top. I get you were grieving and it was a very hard and emotional moment but calling her a wh0re?! \n\nP.S.: She was an asshole too, she didnt respect you all or your mothers memories.", "YTA. I cannot understand why your family would get mad. This was a celebration together. This seemed like a perfect moment to announce **the good news**. Your mom would probably have been thrilled to learn she is going to have a grand kid. \n\nOf course they waited months before saying. People usually wait 3 months before announcing it because the first trimester is where most of the miscarriage happens.", "YTA. Celebrating her grandchild is celebrating a part of your mother still here. I can understand why they wanted to make the announcement in connection with her memory.", ">Some family members and Julie's mom are now calling me a bitch over text for ruining an important moment for her.\n\nYTA. I give Julie a pass because she doesn't know your family well, and she spoke immediately after another family announcement. And I believe you could have shut her down without ending the dinner.", "Yes yta", "I understand from your perspective but also from hers, maybe she was just trying to cheer you guys up with the good news that's why she waited for that moment and not tell the family a month before!", "YTA. You were honoring your mother life, not mourning her death. I understand symbolism of timing to announce that your mother's legacy continues and they are having her grandchild.", "Tough call for me, but I\u2019ll lean towards YTA. Unless something else is missing, she is family and this was a family trip. Understanding that it was to honor your deceased mother, but a new addition to the family sounds like a wonderful blessing. Could she have chosen a better time to announce? Sounds like it. But I have to ask, is every anniversary of mothers passing and/or her birthday going forward mean that no one can ever say anything good about their lives? I know you are grieving but a new family meme we should be a blessing. What would your mother have thought about being a grandma? I wonder if the pain of your loss is overshadowing the joy you should be feeling? Condolences on the loss of your mother. I hope you can find it in your heart to welcome Julie into the family since your entire post is worded like you still haven\u2019t accepted her yet. Good luck", "Yta, your response was way too aggressive.", "If she was very well aware, then definitely you showed her the mirror.", "YTA - it\u2019s wonderful news they are having a baby and of course they would take the opportunity to tell their family in person when people were gathered together.", "Name calling is never ok and we need to stop normalizing it.\n\nESH", "Info: does your family get together often/live near each other? Would she have reason to expect that there would not be another similar get-together soon, or that the family may not attend if she tried to organize one? The only reason I can think of for this is if she couldn\u2019t reasonably foresee another similar gathering soon.", "ESH\n\nShe wanted attention. No one can convince me otherwise. She is way too old for that.\n\nThere was a drastic increase in confrontation that didn't seem 100% warranted on your end. Now, had you tried to inform her that it wasn't the perfect time, then I would be singing a different tune. But you just flipped out. It read as though you were taking something out on her. \n\nAs for the rest of the family, I don't get how people never mind their business. No one should be texting you.

The fact remains tho Julie thought she was honoring her child\u2019s grandma which could have been a sweet moment.\n\nOP reacted harsh and I get it was a knee jerk thing but it\u2019s still harsh nonetheless.  She could have quietly excused herself not yell in the dining room.", "I agree it was an honest mistake but I think that means NAH rather than YTA to OP that\u2019s all", "Agreed, I\u2019d be interested in knowing that", "That\u2019s true but if I were Julie, I wouldn\u2019t have even risked it. She should\u2019ve known the family was in a sensitive position at the moment especially since the whole trip was supposed to be dedicated to the late mother. \n\nI think she should have announced it at a different time instead as she\u2019s had 2 months prior to mention it or mention it when they return from the trip. It just seems disrespectful to me and clearly some of the family members felt the same. \n\nI think the family\u2019s feelings hold higher precedence in this situation as it\u2019s THEIR family member who was just died and this was a commemoration for her.", "That's what I was going to say until : \n\n>This is when I cracked and yelled at her that she wasn't trying to benefit anyone but herself and that she was a selfish attention whore.", "Is OP\u2019s brother not family??? Is OP\u2019s own family not calling her TA leading to this post???", "We don\u2019t know how far along she is. Many people don\u2019t tell their families until they know it is going to \u201cstick.\u201d Often not until the second trimester or even later. No one has the right to say *they* (because it isn\u2019t just Julie, it is OPs own brother) should have made the announcement earlier.", "They can make the announcement whenever they want but it was wrong in the eyes of the family for Julie and her partner to pick the late mothers commemoration trip for the announcement and shouldn\u2019t have expected a positive reactions", "No. It was wrong in the eyes of OP. Her brother is family too, and it was his announcement as much as Julie\u2019s. OP and her brother\u2019s father has expressed no negative reaction and is trying to stay out of the drama, and OP admits she made this post because members of her own family have been telling her she did wrong in addition to Julie\u2019s mother. There is nothing here to suggest the rest of the family agrees with OP.", "\u201cThe entire table went silent, with only a few quiet congratulations\u201d. Then Julie proceeded to not read the room, and chose to throw herself into OP\u2019s face to get a positive reaction from her. That\u2019s not particularly positive"]}
