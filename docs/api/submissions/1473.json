I believe my coworker is constantly lying and is generally upsetting to be around.\n\nThe first thing he's said that made me very suspicious of him, was when it was raining outside our store with some lighting strikes and he stated he was worried about driving home cause he'd been \"shocked by lightning 4 times indirectly and 2 times directly\". Mind you he has barely any kind of scars or skin damage for something like lightning strikes. He has also told us multiple other stories we think are possibly fake. He also has stated he's many different kind of jobs/hobbies including blacksmithing, farming, carpentry, cooking, and much more.\n\nAlso, he recently told us about mental disorders he has at \"opportune\" moments. When he first introduced himself he stated that he had anxiety and dyslexia. Couple months pass and a coworker and I are having a conversation about my autism and he suddenly tells us later that week that he also has autism, because he can tell that the rotating part of one of our machines has one side that spins faster than the other (both sides are connected in the middle with multiple poles). Another day he also brought up that he thinks he has DID because when he's interacting with the kid customers at work he gets excited with them like he has a little alter. I don't want to make them upset by not believing them, but it seems very convenient that he brought these up now rather than later.\n\nLast but not least, he has been sick on and off for about a month now and has not gone to any sort of doctor/test to find out why and he's very unhygienic. He has been constantly sneezes, coughs, and blowing his nose every 5 minutes; to a point where he can't really do his job. Many of us including my boss have asked him why and he has said it's due to \"allergies\". I think he either has a cold, the flu, or something worse. He hasn't gone to any doctors or gotten any tests done because he told us he doesn't have the money for it. Along with this, he doesn't seem to take very good care of his looks/hygiene. His hair is usually greasy in some way and can sometimes look like he hasn't brushed it. He smells like he doesn't use much deodorant and apparently only has about one set of clothes he wears to work. Again, I'm worried these things might not be \"fixable\" to him at the moment due to money, but the unhygienic stuff is against our work code.\n\nWIBTA if I confront him about some/all of these things? I feel like they're things I have no place to bother him about, even though I'm in a higher position than him. Should I have HR handle it instead?\n\nTL/DR: My coworker tells us stories we think are fake, possibly lies about having certain mental disorders, and is unhygienic.
