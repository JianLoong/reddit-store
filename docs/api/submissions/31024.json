Some background: my husband and I have been together for 9 years and my MIL and I have always had a rocky relationship which started when I overheard a phone conversation early while we were dating of her telling him she doesn\u2019t approve of me/us, mostly because she wanted him to date/marry into their ethnic group/culture (he\u2019s Asian, I\u2019m not). There\u2019s been other things over the years too. I\u2019ve always been very LC with her, which has been easy since she\u2019s always lived out of state, but civil/cordial when we do see each other. Fast forward to now, I\u2019m due soon and they decided together (without any input or consideration from me) that she would come December 24-January 3. Annoying but fine, I\u2019ll manage. Last night I get home and walk into their FaceTime conversation, just catching the tail end of it. It took me a few hours but when things finally clicked I asked my husband if they planned on changing the dates his mom would be staying. His response was \u201cthat\u2019s the idea\u201d and when I asked why his response was \u201cwhy not.\u201d I got annoyed and said 10 days is long enough and that I want privacy and time to birth, heal, feed (plan on BF exclusively), and bond with our baby. He pretty much said too bad and again, I got no say. I\u2019m not a fan of ultimatums but I told him if she\u2019s here after January 3 it\u2019s grounds for divorce for me and he basically said good riddance (not in those words but you get the idea). I\u2019m an introvert and I like my peace and privacy as it is and he knows this. Add in a being newly postpartum and a newborn and the fact that they made these plans without asking or even telling me (bare minimum I think) and it\u2019s just overwhelming and frustrating. From what I can piece together from the conversation I caught MIL got fired or quit her job and now the plan is to cancel her plane ticket home (as in, there is currently no date for her to leave). \n\nA little more info, this happened during our wedding planning. Whatever she wanted to do went. My plans for a rehearsal dinner got scrapped and instead we had a huge lunch with every guest invited the day before the wedding. Whoever she wanted to invite got invited. We got married at the court house the previous year and I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of an actual wedding to begin with (again, introvert) so I was indifferent about it and everyone kept saying it\u2019s a cultural thing but I\u2019m always getting pushed aside and treated like my opinions don\u2019t matter and I\u2019m over it. At this point this is the hill I\u2019m willing to die on. (Also, my FIL passed away in 2020 so it\u2019s just his mom)\n\nMy husband and I haven\u2019t spoken since this happened and I got no sleep last night. The last thing any pregnant person needs is all this additional stress but I can\u2019t seem to let it go. So, AITA? And WIBTA if I bypass my husband and tell my MIL I don\u2019t want her here past the original arrangements?", "created_utc": 1700064954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vx3pf/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_dont_want_my_mil_to/", "score": 471, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Personally, I think if your husband basically told you \u201cgood riddance\u201d your relationship is already over. He is checked out. Do yourself a solid and go stay with your family if you are able to. Maybe he is bluffing and this will be a wake up call, or he isn\u2019t and you can start the healing process. I\u2019m sorry this is happening to you.", "Why bother going to your MIL when your husband is the bigger issue?  It's not a MIL problem, it's a husband problem.\n\nSpidey-senses tingling: is it a cultural norms for sons to take in their elderly parents? I know it's an expectation of some cultures, and your comment about her canceling her return ticket, your FIL passing and the general vibe you describe of their conversation, you might have two new housemates. (The other being your newborn.)\n\nNTA, but if it truly is your hill to die on, you are best to lay your cards down and show you're serious now. Whether it be a marriage counselor, mediation, a separation agreement, other. Sounds like he's trying to call your bluff at what is arguably the most vulnerable time you'll be in.", "NTA\n\nIf you can and are able to, leave now already with your daughter. Don\u2019t wait for the new baby to be born first. Are you able to stay with family or friends until you\u2019re able to get your own place with your daughter and baby? \n\nYour husband has made his choice and he didn\u2019t choose you.", "NTA. Divorce. I\u2019m amazed you would have married that momma\u2019s boy in the first place.", "NTA\nBypass MIL,  pack husbands bags and tell him he's more than welcome to spend as much time with his mammy as he wants but he won't be doing it in your house. There is no room for anybody else's comfort when you've just had a baby.  You need quiet,  space and help. Your husband put his mothers visit ahead of your comfort and that's unacceptable. And it doesn't matter what's cultural and what isn't because he should have respect for and your feelings and his mother shouldn't be able to erase that. See a divorce lawyer,  your husband thinks you aren't serious but if this is the hill then get things rolling.", "I can't believe you haven't figured this out already.  MIL is moving in with you.  Do you have family you can stay with?", "NTA - not even up for debate. He said good riddance, good for him, maybe he and mommy can live together and have their own little creepy incestuous relationship together.\n\nWhat about your side of the family or any friends that can support you or offer you a place to stay for a bit to get some separate space to figure out your next move and limit your stress in the late stages of your pregnancy? \n\nSorry you have such an unsupportive husband!\n\nEDIT: the last part, by the sounds of it his mother is probably already aware that you aren\u2019t comfortable with her staying and is just choosing to ignore it so I doubt messaging her would make a difference tbh.", "NTA\n\nDon't wait for the birth to leave, it will be easier to move with one child.  Do you have family you can go stay with? \n\n Your husband does not see you as a partner or an equal.  It is probably his culture to move his mom in to take care of her.  It is not ok for him to do things without talking to you first and actually listening.  Did you know about these things before you married him?", "NTA. If you're LC with her she should not be staying in your home at all, let alone when you're healing and vulnerable.\n\nI'm not sure why you married and had two kids with this man though. He's never set appropriate boundaries with his mother or supported you. \n\nI would die on this hill as well. Marriage counseling or divorce is what I would suggest.", "No return ticket?  Oh, OP, she\u2019s not coming to *visit*, she\u2019s *moving in*.  **Permanently**.

And your MIL has decades of history of her son doing as she says, so she knows he\u2019s not suddenly going to object to this and stop her.  \n\nSo if you don\u2019t want to live with his mom, the conversation you need to have with your husband (and fast, to get things figured out before MIL and the baby arrive) is:  \u201c*you* can choose to live with your mom, but *I* am not.

That\u2019s a very shitty response & plan. Are you actually prepared to leave? Do you have anywhere to go? There\u2019s too much stress here.\n\nI think you should talk to your OB & tell your husband your doctor is recommending you have privacy to recover & care for your child.

Does your husband make all of y\u2019all\u2019s decisions unilaterally or is just anything to do with his mother?\n\nETA: I would not bypass husband to talk to MIL. I would let husband know neither of them are welcome in the house if he can\u2019t agree to at least consult you about these things.", "NTA and what in the world is he doing making plans for houseguests without talking to you about it first? He's still mommy's little boy and you are 2nd (at best) in line of importance to him. That much seems clear.", "NTA and i would begin the process for divorce and protect yourself...get in touch with friends/family to help you through this....his dismissive attitude just means he isnt going to hear anything you say...plus as single mother you need legal support as well", "NTA. File the paperwork now, if you're serious.", "NTA, but you made a big mistake marrying a mama's boy. And your HUSBAND basically said \"go for it\" when you threatened to leave? He's either bluffing out of pride, or really doesn't care if you leave. He may even want you to. But in any event, he's definitely TA and I sure as hell wouldn't stay with him.", "NTA. Your MIL is going to disregard what you say. Either he needs to leave or you need to pack up you and the kid and go now.", "Your husband said good riddance when you said it was divorce worthy, that alone tells me what I need to know and it should tell you too. NTA, but he doesn\u2019t care about your marriage so why should you.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is delusional. You guys aren't close....why would you want her there?\n\n>From what I can piece together from the conversation I caught MIL got fired or quit her job and now the plan is to cancel her plane ticket home (as in, there is currently no date for her to leave).\n\nOhhhhhhboy. I see. I am SO sorry for the shitshow heading your way. \n\nAre you close to your own parents or siblings? I'd probably go stay there to clear my head. \n\n\n r/justnomil may be able to help as well", "NTA: there is no point telling your MIL because at the end of the day you have a huge husband issue.  He is not listening to you and is not standing up for your wants or needs.  OP, if you have family or friends that you can go to (honestly I would kick him out but there are laws in most places against that) you need to take your child and go.

Change it while you still can.", "NTA\n\nHave a plan to keep her out of the birthing room!!!!!!!\n\nIf you are still with this man when you do go into labor there is no doubt in my mind that he is going to do everything in his power to get his mother in that room. \n\nHe's made his stance clear.  Do what is best for you and the baby.  \n\nGoing behind his back to address your MIL is not going to go well. It just won't.", "NTA but you saw all of these red flags from the wedding until now. \n\nThen you proceeded to have two kids with him.\n\nI will never understand people.", "NTA If your husband can invite your mother in law for an extended stay without your knowledge, you certainly are within your rights to call her and tell her she can't stay beyond the previously agreed upon dates. Don't let your husband and his mother bulldoze over your what you want and need.", "NTA. However, can you invite your mom at the same time with no return ticket? That will get the message across loud and clear.", "NTA!! Please leave him and move in with family. Him and his mom toxic are awful! They only want the baby at this point and dont care about you at all.", "This must be hard to hear but if your husband has said good riddance to his pregnant wife to shows, he will choose his entitled inconsiderate mother over his wife and the mother of his kids, This is a huge thing that if you ignore it will come back to you one day and bite you on the a$$.\nThis must be hard during these days but gain all your power and show it to him. Leave to a friend or a family and show him that you're not joking. Cause if you show that you're a push over, all people do, is taking advantages.", "Well, since he made plans with his mother without, you certainly contact his mother and cancel those plans without him and go stay with your mother, if at all possible after birth", "NTA no point in telling your MIL anything, she doesn't care and neither does your husband. The shenanigans that occurred during g your wedding should have been a huge red flag for you - why on earth would you have a child with someone like that?

This is a predicament you've gotten yourself into. All the hassle is now yours.\n\nThis is major...he is disrespecting your wishes over his mother's...he's shown it time and again.  So obviously, MIL is coming, you appear to have no power over that.  Tell your husband you feel VERY strongly about this, that do you NOT agree to more than 10 days right now, maybe she could come for another stay later but YOU DO NOT WANT THIS.  Tell him to make a decision to listen to YOUR wishes or his MOTHER'S wishes.  \n\nIf he goes with his mom, then ...as you already should have known...this will be the way it goes so long as she's alive.  THIS is your life.\n\nYou can figure the rest out later but your first priority is your own comfort after childbirth.  Where is YOUR family? Why  not leave and go stay with them?  If he's not going to care about you, then you should stay with someone who does. \n\nBut long term...you need to either suck it up and learn that you are number two in his life, or leave.  Those are literally your two options.  He has done all but tell you that.", "YTA to yourself. Why did you allow it to get this far? Her walking all over your wedding should have been your biggest red flag to get TF out. Your husband has proven he DOES NOT give a shit about you. Take your daughter and get out now. Literally anyone else in your life willing to help will do.  Any friends or family. Even if you have to go across the country please leave.

Good luck OP!", "NTA\n\nStay on your ground. If your husband has never your back and always stays at your MIL side it's time for divorce. You both (and kids) should be rock solid against the world. \n\nYou are stressed enough. You should talk again with your husband and tell him, that you are stressed at the maximum limit.

Don't bluff.", "My first thought when I read this was \"oh, fuck no.\"  This is not acceptable behavior from him on any level, and worse because you're pregnant.  Kick him out.  He and his mama can go stay wherever they want to, but you need your house.", "NTA for not wanting MIL over for an indefinite amount of time, especially post partum. Now, Y W B T A to yourself if you keep allowing yourself to not be treated as an equal partner in this relationship. The issue isn't your MIL, it's your husband.

You better believe your MIL is moving in, and FYI, you are on your way out, kidless. Get a move on. Your husband is a mummies boy and how you never saw this is baffling. Call a lawyer today, divorces take time.", "Personally I would be either moving out or telling him to leave. Doesn\u2019t need to be permanent if you get counselling/he makes changes but his clear indifference to divorce (and how quickly you leapt to that) suggest to me that divorce was already a forgone conclusion in both of your minds. \nChange the locks when he goes out to work if you want to keep the house and make it very clear why you are doing what you are doing.", "NTA-your most pressing problem is your husband. He doesn\u2019t appear to support you and/or wishes regarding the birth of this child in addition to the previous issues. You need to make a stand and decide if this is something that you can live with. He will not change-he will always support mommy\u2019s wants and needs over yours. You will never be able to set boundaries with him or your MIL. You will need to decide if this is something you can live with or decide if you need to get out.", "NTA. But you\u2019re in this situation because you allowed it. If this happened during wedding planning, there should have been no wedding.", "NTA. \n\nFirst of all, get your family and friends involved in this situation so you don\u2019t feel steamrolled by husband and MIL. \n\nIt appears you have reached a point where your husband has made it clear he\u2019s not going to respect you. If divorce is your path forward then get a consultation with a divorce lawyer asap and before MIL arrives.

She is moving in and no one will stop her. Your husband is 100% on it", "As sorry as I am to say it, I don't think this situation is going to get better. It sounds to me that you are already sort of a pushover (I mean that in a gentle, not blaming, way) and that there is no plans to take your feelings or wishes into consideration. Your MIL is likely moving in with you if she's lost her job.\n\nI do not know what your financial situation is but were I in your shoes, I'd be considering my options and either planning for a divorce or something - I am a bit worried about who owns the home, etc., whether it is possible to force him out of the house, whether you have family to stay with, and if so how this would impact finances, custody, etc. I am also a bit concerned for you and your kids' safety. You haven't suggested any violence but what concerns me is that they defacto think they control you and if you make moves to emancipate yourself they could start more threatening behaviours.", "NTA you don\u2019t have a MIL problem you have a husband problem going to her is useless bc your husband will by pass you , I do y normally believe in ultimatums but in this case it is warranted I\u2019d leave go to a friends , a relatives etc and not come home until he agrees with what you want , if you don\u2019t take a stand now then MIL is going to live with you and raise your baby the way she wants & husband will be fine with it", "So if MIL lost her job and cancelled her return ticket home, it sounds like she\u2019s moving in with you. Whether that\u2019s the case or not, your husband is a massive AH for unilaterally inviting her, even against your wishes, intentionally excluding you from that conversation and then telling you good riddance. Why are you with him?? Why does he treat you like his property instead of as his partner? \n\nNTA btw but hubby and MIL sure are", "NTA. Don't wait - call a divorce lawyer today. Your spouse doesn't respect you even a little bit and you deserve so much better. Don't wait until she moves in. Leave him TODAY.", "NTA oh dear please leave \ud83d\ude22", "NTA. \nI am hoping someone from your husband\u2019s cultural background will comment.  \nMy understanding, which is limited- my husband has 2 half brothers who are Asian through their other half-  respecting your elders is a big deal.  Living with your aging parents is a common occurrence.  \nI agree with the other poster that your MIL is probably moving in.  I do think that it is extremely bizarre that your husband didn\u2019t tell you this?  Unless there is something else going on in your relationship or he knew you would throw down about it and he thought that he could just sneak her in \u201cfor a visit\u201d and then \u201cextend the visit\u201d and somehow you just wouldn\u2019t notice that she wasn\u2019t leaving.

FIL has passed away, she has no job, what reason does she have to ever go home at all? \nI would be tempted to ask him this in a therapist\u2019s office, if he is willing to go with you to one.  Having a third party person who can help navigate this conversation would be beneficial.  Especially when it sounds like he is saying mom is coming and doesn\u2019t care how you feel and you\u2019re saying if she stays you\u2019re going to divorce him with a newborn and a 1.5 year old toddler.   It sounds like both of you are going into this conversation with your walls up.  A therapist could help with that.   If you want to be married I mean.

She'll come anyway.  \n\nIt seems like it's time that you tell him that if she comes (for even a single day) that you and the children won't be there and you won't return until she is gone.

Some background: my husband and I have been together for 9 years and my MIL and I have always had a rocky relationship which started when I overheard a phone conversation early while we were dating of her telling him she doesn\u2019t approve of me/us, mostly because she wanted him to date/marry into their ethnic group/culture (he\u2019s Asian, I\u2019m not). There\u2019s been other things over the years too. I\u2019ve always been very LC with her, which has been easy since she\u2019s always lived out of state, but civil/cordial when we do see each other. Fast forward to now, I\u2019m due soon and they decided together (without any input or consideration from me) that she would come December 24-January 3. Annoying but fine, I\u2019ll manage. Last night I get home and walk into their FaceTime conversation, just catching the tail end of it. It took me a few hours but when things finally clicked I asked my husband if they planned on changing the dates his mom would be staying. His response was \u201cthat\u2019s the idea\u201d and when I asked why his response was \u201cwhy not.\u201d I got annoyed and said 10 days is long enough and that I want privacy and time to birth, heal, feed (plan on BF exclusively), and bond with our baby. He pretty much said too bad and again, I got no say. I\u2019m not a fan of ultimatums but I told him if she\u2019s here after January 3 it\u2019s grounds for divorce for me and he basically said good riddance (not in those words but you get the idea). I\u2019m an introvert and I like my peace and privacy as it is and he knows this. Add in a being newly postpartum and a newborn and the fact that they made these plans without asking or even telling me (bare minimum I think) and it\u2019s just overwhelming and frustrating. From what I can piece together from the conversation I caught MIL got fired or quit her job and now the plan is to cancel her plane ticket home (as in, there is currently no date for her to leave). \n\nA little more info, this happened during our wedding planning. Whatever she wanted to do went. My plans for a rehearsal dinner got scrapped and instead we had a huge lunch with every guest invited the day before the wedding. Whoever she wanted to invite got invited. We got married at the court house the previous year and I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of an actual wedding to begin with (again, introvert) so I was indifferent about it and everyone kept saying it\u2019s a cultural thing but I\u2019m always getting pushed aside and treated like my opinions don\u2019t matter and I\u2019m over it. At this point this is the hill I\u2019m willing to die on. (Also, my FIL passed away in 2020 so it\u2019s just his mom)\n\nMy husband and I haven\u2019t spoken since this happened and I got no sleep last night. The last thing any pregnant person needs is all this additional stress but I can\u2019t seem to let it go. So, AITA? And WIBTA if I bypass my husband and tell my MIL I don\u2019t want her here past the original arrangements?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If he refuses again, and tells you that you don't have a say, then the MIL really isn't the problem in this scenario. It would be time to go. Before the baby gets here. I would have my own mother come in if that's possible for you, or any other super close relative, to help you get the hell out of there. Because he just thinks you'll just roll over and submit.", "NTA. ABSOLUTELY. FUCKING. NOT.\n\nYour husband didn't even pretend that he gave a shit about your opinion on this matter. \n\nWas he just going to lie to you until his mother showed up? And then be like surprise she's here for good?!\n\nI would leave. As your kids get older what other important decisions is he going to make without even consulting you. If he were my husband, that one thing would have completely annihilated any shred of trust I had in him.", "My whole jaw DROPPED. I would have been out the door with my older child that NIGHT. absolutely not.", "I think because she knows it\u2019s over she should do the opposite\u2026 move the most obnoxious friend in, or a sibling or parent. Oh the room is already taken. Looks like mom is sharing a bed with my friend bob! He snores and farts in bed but hey, my house guest was here first! He\u2019s said it\u2019s over. Take over the house! Edge him out!", "Right? Mom's coming to take care of the kids when he kicks OP to the curb.", "Yeah, your MIL is moving in.", "This was my thought as well. \n\nNTA, OP. Your husband should have brought up a discussion with you about his mom staying, even before he confirmed things and set dates with her. Even if the plan isn't for her to make a permanent move to your house, you do deserve to at least be involved in the plan.", "Tbh if I were op I would leave to stay somewhere else. Op\u2019s DH couldn\u2019t care less about her and her opinions. Seriously wtf", "Yeah it\u2019s pretty common. Especially after their wives have a baby.\n\nI say this with all the love and gratefulness for my In-Laws. Once they move in, they\u2019re not going to leave. I wasn\u2019t informed of this until they were already there and I was understandably upset. For some reason, the sons think they need to burden their parental responsibility on their own parents. It\u2019s cause for tons of frustration and disrespect.\n\nAnd mind you, I felt this way LOVING his parents and I\u2019d pay for whatever they wanted. I can\u2019t imagine dealing with this with in-laws I don\u2019t get along with.", "I agree with this. The time to show him you are serious is now. Tell him you have decided it is not OK for her to stay with you at all.  If the plan is for her to move to your city, he just needs to be honest with you and start looking for an apartment for her now. Where is your family? Can you pack up your stuff and go stay with them if she shows up with a suitcase? You are NTA, marriage requires both parties to agree on these types of things, and your husband is overstepping his bounds.", "Mil is definitely moving in, this poor op", "This isn\u2019t going to get better. Great advice in this thread.", "Yeah, the MIL and the husband are completely steamrolling OP. She's going to stand up for herself once and for all or this is going to be her life from now on.", "This is why in cross cultural marriages you first need to carefully analyse the culture itself and then how much your partner is immersed in it. So many marriages fail or turn sour because of cultural expectations.", "\u23eb\ufe0f listen", "Yup this right here. Leave now. Don\u2019t give them the chance. Get your support system in place for your postpartum experience.", "I absolutely agree with you, he has no respect for OP, and will do what he wants to do.", "OP doesn\u2019t have a MIL issue, OP has a husband issue that I\u2019m guessing started early in the relationship. Being introverted is mostly irrelevant. You can be the most extroverted person and you still deserve say over your wedding, who gets to stay for extended periods of time and how things go when you\u2019re pregnant/have children. \n\nYour husband is the problem here, his priority should be the family he has created and chosen with his wife, not his mother.", "I'd have already been out the door. OP, he will just end up treating the kids the same way he treats you. Do you really want your children to grow up having zero say in their own life?\n\nI understand you might love him and such, but if he loved you back, that certainly wouldn't have been his response.", "Please do this. Leave now. He needs to know you are equal partners and he doesnt get to tell you who will be living with you while you are looking after a newborn", "Consult an attorney FIRST to understand your rights for your state.  You can pursue orders for temporary custody, primary access to the house, temporary restraining order against husband and/ or MIL while divorce & custody proceedings are under way\u2026perhaps your husband will come to his senses once he starts hearing from your attorney.  If not, you can at least keep his mother from moving into YOUR domicile.", "What r/CheeryBottom said.  Spot on.", "Came here to basically say this too. OP is better off leaving now and contacting a lawyer. Either go to friends / family or get a hotel and start appartment hunting. Your hb has chosen his mom over you every chance he got, it's not going to change, you don't matter enough to him, so you need to start choosing yourself and your children.", "I agree with your comment. As soon as the MIL hijacked the rehearsal dinner with husband\u2019s approval I would have run. If you have a place to go now, leave him and hire an attorney", "I like making him pack his bags and it is the right thing. She should not have to leave and he can go cuddle with mommy. She definitely needs to speak with a divorce lawyer and get the ducks lined up before the order to vacate. It needs to be done with the force of the law and representation.", "This.\n\nOP, do you have any family members you can stay with? Would your parents be willing to take you in? If so, leave with your daughter. Have the child and go home with your parents. Talk to an attorney about how you can do all of this legally but you do NOT have to set yourself on fire here.\n\nInsist on couples counseling with your husband but if he truly doesn't care about your feelings enough to invite his mom to stay indefinitely then I'm not sure how long you want to stay and deal with this disrespect.", "I think the hubby needs to go. Why should she give up her home for him and his mommy dearest.", "Yep. I agree with this comment. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t be welcome to stay. I\u2019m LC with my MIL and if she comes to town my husband offers to book a hotel vacay or a flight to visit my friends.\n\nWhat he did was not okay", "100%\n\nthey\u2019re gonna play a weird game of house and try to use OP\u2019s kids", "I second this. All you have to do OP is tell the hospital that no one is allowed in the room (you can even have hubby kicked out if you need to) and no visitors unless you specifically request them. So your own mother or friend or whoever you want for your support person", "If she knows in which hospital she will go to give birth she can tell the nurses up front that she doesn't want her MIL to come with her. The staff could then tell them when it is time that only the husband is allowed.", "Not to her husband, apparently.", "This.  I'm all for fighting it out and calling the MIL to say no, or kicking husband out...but at this point, OP is very pregnant and for the least amount of stress, I would just say 'if your mother is coming beyond our agreed up on time, I'm leaving. I'm going to stay with my mom/sister whatever but I won't be in this house...MY house, if you insist on going against my wishes and having your mother stay beyond the agreed upon time. \n\nHonestly...leave.", "If her husband is on the mortgage she can\u2019t legally lock him out. So I wouldn\u2019t suggest doing that. It\u2019s better for her to leave if possible and not tell him when she goes to the hospital for the baby to be born and wait the requisite time (if any) to file for divorce.", "Yeah, I 100% believe this is MIL moving in.", "Divorce is the only option here.", "Your solution to this recurring sidelining and disrespect?", "are you going to explain why or", "Why?", "MIL does like OP and I seriously doubt OP would get any rest with her in the house.", "And by leave, I mean leave the marriage, not necessarily leave your home. If you can have him leave and tell him to stay with his mother or anyone else, that\u2019s even better, but if not, then walk right out that door and don\u2019t look back. And keep your other child with you. Keep physical custody of your child in your control (and have a plan for her with your friends or family during the birth) because (I believe, at least in my state) the person who physically has the child gets to keep them until the courts decide custody. I wouldn\u2019t trust your husband and MIL not to pack up your toddler and keep her from you.", "And it makes me wonder if he's already consulted with a lawyer. I'm not usually one to go straight to \"divorce him,\" but I think you've got good reason to. He's clearly told you he doesn't care about you. I'd go to a lawyer immediately to find out if there's a way to get him out of the house before the birth and keep him out afterwards. And if you can't, how to take your daughters with you. You can also prevent him from coming into your room at the hospital. Bc you don't need the stress of being vulnerable around someone who's not looking out for you during delivery.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

For sure she needs at least a exit plan but she is in a critical state of pregnancy, so i am not sure how that will work out.", "You are right. I just dont know if you can force someone out. It's worth a try.", "You can't force someone in. Pack his bags, one way ticket, your mom isn't welcome, don't come home until you have your crap together, and most importantly GET A LAWYER."]}
