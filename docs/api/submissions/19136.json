{"id": 19136, "submission_id": "142jrza", "title": "AITA for not allowing a service dog into my house", "selftext": "I (25f) recently got my own place. It is small, so I can only have a certain amount of people over at a time or it will get very crowded. I thought I will throw a little housewarming party, so I sent out invites and asked for RSVP so I could plan the right amount of food. Luckily most the people on my list said they will come.\n\nOn the day of the party, half way into it, my cousin Beth showed up with her girlfriend, Tina (25). I have only met Tina once before this but knew that she has some medical problems and she has a service dog that helps with her seizures. Tina brought her dog with her that day as well.\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t like dogs. I\u2019m not afraid of them and not allergic to them and I can watch them from afar or on films, but I don\u2019t like interacting closely with dogs in real life. My home is pet free. I don\u2019t mind other animals like cats or fish but I also don\u2019t keep them. I just don\u2019t like dogs\u2026the smell, the bark, everything.\n\nThe other thing I should mention is that Beth did not respond that she will be at the party and I also did not invite Tina. As I said, limited space.\n\nI told Beth and Tina that they are welcome to join us but I can\u2019t have the dog in my place. I\u2019m not ready to deal with any kind of emergency regarding the dog. Tina argued that the dog is her service animal and if I don\u2019t allowed her dog to be with her, I might as well just kick her out.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might be TA. Instead of saying anything back to Tina, I just stood there, staring at her. I mean, kicking her and her dog out did not seem like a bad idea at all, to be honest. Tina seemed to get the message and quickly told Beth they should leave as they shouldn\u2019t stay where they were not welcome. \n\nBeth and Tina later called me, saying they couldn\u2019t believe I was such an ableist. I just don\u2019t want dogs in my space.

Only because you didn't invite Tina and Beth didn't respond with her +1. If you ever invite Tina into your home, you need to accept her medical device along with her or you're TA.", "NTA.  Your house, your rules.  And they should have coordinated and cleared it with you first before bringing an animal with them; that would be common courtesy.", "NTA. You didn't invite them so you had no expectation of having to deal with the dog in your space. It'd be something different if you had invited her and then excluded the dog, I think.", "NTA but just so you know a service dog isn't supposed to interact with anyone since it could distract them from their job (alerting his owner), they are also not supposed to bark because they are very well trained\n\nWhat kind of dog emergency do you mean?", "NTA - Dog or no dog, she flat out wasn't invited to a party with limited space.  Full stop.  The fact that all of you made it about the dog is embarrassing for all of you.  All of you need to do better.", "NTA, uninvited guests don\u2019t get to act pissy when they aren\u2019t invited inside, no matter what the reason is", "NTA. You don't bring animals into other peoples' houses without their permission.", "NTA. They were not invited. And you don\u2019t want dogs there. It\u2019s very simple. Your home. I don\u2019t care it\u2019s a service dog. You don\u2019t want dogs in your home. Regardless of how well it\u2019s behaved.", "I am in the fence for this one. \n\nWould you have let Tina in as a party- crasher if she didn't have the dog? If so, then this isn't about the party crashing as it is as much the dog, which would make you the AH. \n\nIf you were upset about Tina being uninvited and just showing up and you didn't want to invite her in regardless of the dog, then no, you're NTA, but I would have let them know your place couldn't accommodate one more person. \n\nIf this is strictly about the dog and not the person, then asking them not to allow a service dog (not an ESA) to be there with them is like telling a paraplegic that they can't drive their wheelchair in. This dog is a medical necessity.", ">if I don\u2019t allowed her dog to be with her, I might as well just kick her out\n\nThat is 100% accurate. If you are unable or unwilling to allow a service dog into your home, you are kicking out the person who needs the service dog. That's simply a fact.\n\nIf you had *invited* Tina to your home and barred entry to the dog, you would have been a complete AH. Since she was not invited, you are within your rights to not allow her in, but you handled it extremely poorly. (For future reference, the non AH-ish way to respond would have been, \"Oh, I'm so sorry for the confusion. I'm really not prepared for extra guests...Beth, I wish you had told me you wanted to bring Tina, I could have saved you the trip.\")\n\nBut one more thing...\n>I\u2019m not ready to deal with any kind of emergency regarding the dog.\n\nUmm... The dog is there to *prevent* a medical emergency. Refusing to allow the dog in while allowing the person in is completely counterproductive.\n\nESH. Tina/Beth for party crashing, you for handling them so poorly.", ">Beth did not respond that she will be at the party and I also did not invite Tina. As I said, limited space.\n\nWhy didn't you just keep the refusal to the fact that you weren't expecting either of them to attend? Limited space.\n\nNTA, but you are the one who muddied the waters by bringing the dog into the issue.", "ESH, ultimately. You are within your rights to disallow dogs on your property and that does not make you TA on its own merit, but you didn't handle this well. Beth and Tina are within their rights to be miffed as you are excluding Tina on the basis of her disability (and it seems as though you would have ostensibly been OK with her attending if not for her medical equipment); however, Beth should not have showed up to an RSVP event with no RSVP and Tina should not have come at all. \n\nNot tolerating the service dog means not having Tina in the house. This isn't an \"emotional support\" gray-area; the dog is bonafide medical equipment. What you did was the equal of saying that a wheelchair-bound person is welcome in the house but the wheelchair isn't. This is not a good look. \n\nIt would have been better to be blunt and say that you don't allow dogs in your home, so unfortunately Tina will not be able to attend the party. You are not *required* to have the service dog in your house--it is a private space--but no dog, no Tina. It doesn't sound like you're that close to Tina, anyway. Taking this stance is definitely going to destroy any \"relationship\" between you and Tina and possibly cause a rift with Beth, but, well, you're not TA for not caring about that. It's your house. \n\nIf this miffed Beth and Tina, they should have RSVP'd no and they *absolutely* should not have shown up. (It baffles me that they did so. Best case scenario, they guilt you into letting the dog into the house... and, then what? You have a wonderful party with no ill feelings? Unlikely.) You should not have been wishy-washy about the dog. \n\nAll parties committed faux pas.", "In my opinion, ESH, not for not wanting to have a dog in your house, that\u2019s your right and I don\u2019t blame you for being upset that they showed up without informing you that they were coming. However, saying they could join as long as the dog didn\u2019t come in, that\u2019s when you become a bit of an asshole.\n\nThat\u2019s a service dog, it\u2019s also currently working which means it has full focus on its owner. It\u2019s a medical service dog as well and it\u2019s for seizures. I assume it warns the owner before an incoming seizure or when it possibly could come. What\u2019s worse than having a person experiencing a seizure in your home with a medically trained service dog that is trained to keep the owner safe during the seizure and alarm before it? Having a person that\u2019s suddenly having a seizure with no service dog to alert beforehand nor to help during the seizure.\n\nLong story short, you can\u2019t ask her to leave her medically trained dog there for her safety outside. Either it\u2019s you can come in with your service dog which most likely is something you need so you can\u2019t expect her to risk having a seizure without the dog there, or you don\u2019t give them the option to come in at all.", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t invited at all and the person she came with didn\u2019t even bother to rsvp which in polite society means: not coming.\n\nNow Had you invited her you would have had to tell on the invite that you would not be comfortable with the dog, and if you hadn\u2019t stated that, knowing she had a service dog, you would have been an ass for not letting them in and dealing with your own mistake.\n\nBut as that wasn\u2019t what happened\u2026 yeah NTA.", "ESH. \nYes, it\u2019s rude to show up to a party uninvited. However, service dogs aren\u2019t pets- they\u2019re not going to create an emergency, they\u2019re going to prevent one. They\u2019re not going to damage anything or bite anyone- they standard of training is SO HIGH. This dog was literally no threat to anyone. If you had been deathly afraid of it, I might have some sympathy for you because fear is irrational. But no- you just didn\u2019t want to be be bothered, and it probably destroyed any relationship you had with your cousin. \n\nSo yeah, while it would have been better if they\u2019d asked before showing up, the fact that you can\u2019t seem to get that this is not like a regular dog tells me you\u2019re not informed enough about what a service dog really does.", "NTA. Your house your party your rule, especially you didn't invite Tina.", "ESH. They should have rsvp\u2019d and asked about bringing the dog. That\u2019s common curtesy. You aren\u2019t allergic or afraid of dogs and a service dog (who are trained and typically well behaved) comes with a guest. It\u2019s crazy to me you would just be like nahhhh. Especially since it\u2019s not just an emotional support animal. It\u2019s an actual service dog who I\u2019m assuming detects seizures which is a real and serious issue.", "NTA, or an ableist. You're not compromising your home for the need of someone who was never invited. You should ask Beth and Tina if they made dinner for the old lady down the block from them, and call them ableist when they tell you they didn't.", "NTA\n\n You have the right to deny anyone, or anything in your home. \n\nService dogs are still dogs, and making you uncomfortable in your own home is not someone else's decision. For someone who has issues of her own, she should definitely be able to understand that.", "Nta. Good for you to stand your ground.", "NTA because she wasn't invited. It's fine that you don't want animals in the home, but maybe reconsider a little bit about what the dog actually does. If they're a seizure alert animal, they're potentially saving a life. It's kind of like demanding someone take off their insulin pump to enter. Your house, your rules, but this does come across a bit shitty without reading the full context of the not-invited part.", "NTA - your home, your rules. You did not kick them out of a public space. Service dogs are legally permitted in all public spaces. Your home is your personal space", "NTA but NOT because of the dog, but because she crashed the party.", "This was not ableism  This is about your Beth not RSPVing, and inviting Tina without asking you first... at best, she was rude.

If she had RSVP\u2019d in advance this would have already been addressed.", "YTA for the way you handled it. Staring at Tina until she left was rude as fuck. as a host, there are much more gracious ways to turn people away. you should have talked with Beth privately. no room for the dog means a threat to Tina\u2019s safety and unfortunately you didn\u2019t know they\u2019d both be coming.\n\nis it a known thing in your group how much you dislike dogs? \n\ni also just want to make sure you\u2019re aware that service animals are like an extension of the person using them - they\u2019re a package deal always. just keep it in mind in your future dealings with Tina and Beth.", "I mean I'd probably vote NAH despite the strong asshole vibes I get from this post", "NTA", "ESH. \n \nBeth should have RSVP\u2019d and asked if a plus one was allowed, if you didn\u2019t make it clear when sending invitations. She also should have made you aware of the service dog. I get you don\u2019t like dogs, but service dogs are very well trained and needed - especially in Tina\u2019s case because they can help her when a seizure is coming and in some cases are trained to alert others. They\u2019re not cute accessory dogs that you carry in your purse and eat the furniture. They\u2019re an extension of their owner.", "NTA because they didn't RSVP and give you an opportunity to let them know about your no dog policy. I understand that in this instance her dog is medical necessity but you are not required to let a dog in your home.", "YTA. Instead of telling Beth that she didn't RSVP and you simply don't have room for her - let alone her and her plus one - you made it about the service dog. That alone makes you a huge A right there. You had a perfectly rational, entirely reasonable explanation, and you decided \"nope, gonna make it about the dog\" because... well, you didn't bother to explain why you did that.\n\nYou seem to understand that this dog is important for her seizure disorder, yet your behavior makes it clear that you see the dog as a pet. I mean, would you tell someone, \"Hey, you're totally welcome to come in, but I can't let you have the wheelchair inside. I don't want to deal with any kind of emergency related to the wheelchair\"? No, of course not.\n\nAnd yet... you clearly think your request was perfectly reasonable and not at all AHish. Why is that, OP? You claim you're not scared of dogs - you *just don't like* them. So you want this person to put her health and life in danger because, whelp, you don't *like* dogs?\n\nImagine having a service dog who alerted you to seizures before they happened, giving you a window of time where you can take critical safety precautions like getting to a safe space and/or lying down. Now imagine having some jerk tell you \"you can come in, but you can't have that dog in here.\" Like, sure, let me get inside that place an expose myself to completely unnecessary risks - including serious head injury from falling - all because this guy \"just doesn't like dogs.\"\n\nTL;DR - OP, you kicked a person with a disability out of your home *because you don't like dogs,* (in case you are wondering, OP, YES, that was an ableist thing to do) and you're especially TA because you could've simply said, \"Sorry, but you didn't RSVP, and I don't have the space.\"", "NTA I hate dogs.

You clearly knew in advance that Tina had a service dog. And you have to know - it's normal - that when you invite a person to your party, as you did Beth, it is reasonable and likely that she will bring her partner, unless you've specifically excluded plus-ones. So, you knew in advance that Tina might come, and you knew already that Tina has a service dog, and if you feel that strongly about service dogs in your home, you should have let Beth know that any invitation to her, did not include her girlfriend's service dog and therefore *did not include* her girlfriend.  Not doing that was a AH move as it meant you turned Tina away literally at the door.", "ESH - It was Beth and Tina's responsibility to accept the invitation (and on Beth for asking if she can bring her girlfriend). That's on them, especially given that Tina has accommodations that, at the very least, need to be made known to the hostess of the party. You need to know what may happen if Tina has a seizure at your place.\n\nThat being said, your views on not allowing Tina in your place are wrong. Her dog is a service dog. You can't deny entry for Tina BECAUSE of the dog. You can deny entry because she wasn't invited, but it can't be because of her dog. You telling her that she can come in but not her dog is wrong. She needs her dog, her dog is non-negotiable. You can't try to say \"you can come but your dog? Nah, pass.\" That's where you are wrong.", "YTA for viewing a service dog as no different than a pet.\n\nN T A for being annoyed that Beth didn't RSVP.

Tina has her dog because of *seizures*, of course she's not gonna leave her dog outside - I agree with the wheelchair metaphor. I also don't understand not wanting to deal with a dog emergency, but not caring about Tina having a seizures-related emergency.

It is small, so I can only have a certain amount of people over at a time or it will get very crowded. I thought I will throw a little housewarming party, so I sent out invites and asked for RSVP so I could plan the right amount of food. Luckily most the people on my list said they will come.\n\nOn the day of the party, half way into it, my cousin Beth showed up with her girlfriend, Tina (25). I have only met Tina once before this but knew that she has some medical problems and she has a service dog that helps with her seizures. Tina brought her dog with her that day as well.\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t like dogs. I\u2019m not afraid of them and not allergic to them and I can watch them from afar or on films, but I don\u2019t like interacting closely with dogs in real life. My home is pet free. I don\u2019t mind other animals like cats or fish but I also don\u2019t keep them. I just don\u2019t like dogs\u2026the smell, the bark, everything.\n\nThe other thing I should mention is that Beth did not respond that she will be at the party and I also did not invite Tina. As I said, limited space.\n\nI told Beth and Tina that they are welcome to join us but I can\u2019t have the dog in my place. I\u2019m not ready to deal with any kind of emergency regarding the dog. Tina argued that the dog is her service animal and if I don\u2019t allowed her dog to be with her, I might as well just kick her out.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might be TA. Instead of saying anything back to Tina, I just stood there, staring at her. I mean, kicking her and her dog out did not seem like a bad idea at all, to be honest. Tina seemed to get the message and quickly told Beth they should leave as they shouldn\u2019t stay where they were not welcome. \n\nBeth and Tina later called me, saying they couldn\u2019t believe I was such an ableist. I just don\u2019t want dogs in my space. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We can agree Tina or Beth was rude for not giving notice. \n\nBut once OP had accepted that and said she was willing to overlook the lack of RSVP, she gave a different and separate reason for saying she wouldn't let the dog in. The question is whether that was an AH move.", "Stop with the comparisons to a wheelchair it makes you look foolish. The medical device is a dog, OP doesn\u2019t want animals in her house, end of story. You can argue until you\u2019re blue in the face but you\u2019re just wrong and will continue to be wrong.", "No a person does not have to accept someone with a service animal, wheelchair, oxygen tank,  etc to their private home. That is their prerogative. It does NOT change the fact the things I just listed are technically medical devices that divert medical emergencies. So what OP is an AH on is like this: you are welcome to stay as long as you leave your wheelchair, oxygen tank, epi pen, communication board, etc. Whereas public places cannot do that to a person, legally. The issue is more of morals and personal ethics.", "If giving someone acess to your home who you know is disabled you are giving permission for any medical device they may need. Tina was accepted her medical device (service animal) was not. What OP did was litterally like saying you can come in but remove your insulin pump and no using it while at my home to someone with diabetes, OP should have left it at sorry but you didnt rsvp, it is wrong to invite a disabled person into your home but tell them they only can come in without their medical device, its just mocking them really, its like going hey you can come in, but only if you stop being disabled...", "OP made it clear the number of guests were not the issue. You being ableist was shown by you not being able to understand that tina and the service dog are not 2 seperate guests, they are one.", "Would you ask a person in a wheelchair to come in but leave their chair outside? What op did is no different.", "Service dogs MAY or may not still have SOME rights, but it 100% depends on a lot of different factors, which makes it more murky. It really all depends on where OP lives, who owns the place she's in, etc. \n\nBut either way, morally, OP's wrong. Legally, it's more unclear. I'm not sure if guests in a private residence have any rights or not; I tried looking up the Fair Housing Act, but I also don't know if OP even lives in the US.", "Lmao at least you're consistent I guess", "I'm arguing about OP morally being an asshole, not legally being one. Morally, OP sucks.", "yeah \"leave behind your medically necessary thing because I don't like it\" makes you an asshole, sorry. OP should have just kept it at \"you didn't rsvp and I don't have enough space/food for both of you\"", "No, I just don't see how that makes anyone an AH.  There would have to be some expectation that was being denied; I don't see that here."]}
