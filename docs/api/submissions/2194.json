So back story, when me and him met he was a party hard drunk 3-4 24 packs a weekend and have people over guy. Things ended badly and he said he would change. Well we\u2019ve been together for 9 months and he\u2019s gotten so much better u til the last 2-3 months. He moved in with me. He\u2019s wanting to invite people over every weekend and drink and get drunk (which him not getting drunk was part of our agreement for getting back together) and stay up late. I\u2019ve asked several times to let me know when people are coming over instead of them just showing up unannounced to me. And that\u2019s started an argument when I tell him it\u2019s a respect thing.  And I don\u2019t appreciate him inviting people over every weekend and wanting to stay up late. Just going to bed isn\u2019t an option for me because we live in a small two bedroom trailer, and they all get loud when they drink. He doesn\u2019t work full time through the week like me, and I just want a peaceful weekend to relax and get my sleep in. So am I the asshole for always bringing it up and wanting to stop it?

There has to be some sort of compromise.
