{"id": 7117, "submission_id": "109i9uw", "title": "AITA for calling my stepdad a weirdo?", "selftext": "So the backstory on this is I am 19M, my dad died when I was really little and my mum remarried when I was about 6. We'll call my stepdad Jason. Jason has a daughter of his own - we'll call her Hayley (21F) - whose mother also died, so Hayley and I were basically raised as siblings.  \n\nPardon my French, but I think Hayley is just the coolest fucking person on the planet. She's strong, hardworking, whip-smart, funny, literally the kindest person I know...if there's a nice thing you can say about a person, you can say it about Hayley. Honestly, with her, as far as I'm concerned, there is no \"step\" about it; Hayley is my big sister and also my best friend. I actually consider her one of my heroes. \n\nHowever, for some reason, Jason has always seemed to want to encourage a rivalry between us. For example, when we were kids Mum and Hayley used to have a \"girl's day\" a couple times a month where they'd spend time together, go and get their nails done, go out to eat etc. together and every time Jason would ask if I was mad they spent so much time together (I never was as Mum spent plenty of quality time with me too). Or I always did a bit better than Hayley did re: test scores and stuff, and every time I did well he'd ask her if he was jealous. \n\nThis hasn't stopped as we've gotten older. Hayley and I both love to cook and have often bonded over this hobby. However for me it has always been just that; a hobby, something I do for fun but don't dedicate my life too. For Hayley it's more of a passion and something she *does* want to dedicate her life to and make a career of. She recently got accepted into a really prestigious cookery school here in the UK so we had a family gathering to celebrate it. In front of everyone, Jason asked if I wasn't \"just green with envy\" that Hayley is doing this and I'm not. My aunt piped up and asked why I would be jealous and I said \"I'm not, Jason is just a weirdo who wants me and Hayley to not get on for some reason.\" \n\nWell, he kicked off about that a bit. Called me a brat and an arsehole and accused me of slandering him. He hasn't let it go since and he keeps asking me why I want mum's family to hate him so much. He keeps going on about it to the point that I feel like it might really have been a dick move.

He probably asks these sorts of questions among his friends as well, trying to make the conversation \"interesting\" to him but uncomfortable to others. He may or may not realize how this comes off to others.\n\nThis may be the first time you've commented on his jabs, and it was only in self defense from him calling you jealous. Because you chose to say this in front of your mom's family, I can understand why he thought you were trying to shame him in front of them.\n\nIf you want to settle this, you can tell him exactly how you've felt when he tries to stir up jealousy between you and your sister.  To be the better person, you could apologize for saying what you did in front of others (even though it was true and deserved), saying you only wanted him to realize how he was making you feel.", "NTA Jason needs therapy", "NTA. There are people who are only happy when they can stir up disputes between other people around them, so they can sit back and feast on the agression and hatred they have fostered.

Definitely something to have a conversation about in private. Maybe tell him that he needs to get the fuck over himself (but in a nice way u know?) NTA. Also, its really sweet that you and Haley have such a nice relationship <3  \n\n\nEdit: Cuz thats the thing it sounds like ur stepdad is really insecure about being ur \"step\"dad u know? def something weird going on. he is prolly projecting alot? which tbf, how could u not, but also like, why's he so mad all the time it seems like things r p lit u know? like it doesn't seem like hes explicitly doing a bad job, except for weird lil things like this???? idk i think Jason is being very weird. Especially because, yeah, ur literally on reddit right now instead of talking to him about it, so it def seems like there is maybe something fishy going on??? maybe \"jason\" doesn't really nurture direct communication from you???", "NTA, he is bizarre...", "NTA.", "Is it slander if it is true?
