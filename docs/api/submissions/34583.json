{"id": 34583, "submission_id": "191jq4i", "title": "AITA for telling my MIL to stay out of things that don't fucking concern her?", "selftext": "My husband and I took some time out from his mom last year because she was interfering into my personal business that had no impact on her whatsoever.\n\nThe gist of what happened is; I was contacted by some biological family members of mine, my late father's parents and two of his siblings. They had reached out to say they regretted letting me and my younger sister go into foster care when we were 6 and 2 after our parents died. My sister died in foster care and then I was left totally alone with no family. So having these people reach out now that I'm 29 and haven't seen them in over two decades, it pissed me off. \n\nThe reason for them not taking me is I was my father's affair baby. He was married with kids when he and my mom started an affair and his marriage to his ex wife only came to an end when my mom was 6 months pregnant with me. The fallout meant my father was hated, understandably, but so was I and so was my sister when she was born. I have very vague memories of his older children and none of them pleasant. My father's parents and siblings all sided with his ex wife and the children once my parents died and decided foster care was the only place for us since we had nobody on our maternal side (my mother was a foster kid herself). I saw my grandparents and aunts and uncles at my sister's funeral but she was buried by the state since none of them claimed her body and I was just a child myself so I couldn't.\n\nI had no desire to welcome them into my life or to \"forgive\" and form a relationship.\n\nMy MIL started making comments that I should give them a chance or I will regret it. She said how am I ever supposed to know \"my siblings\" if I don't make the effort. My husband told her to stop. I even told her \"my siblings\" weren't part of the group who reached out and from the limited info I heard they have no interest in establishing anything with me and it sounds like they feel like I should have died with my sister. MIL said it didn't mean I shouldn't try and then she wanted to know their names so she could talk to them. After her not letting up despite my husband telling her multiple times. We decided to take that break from her. Then a little over a week ago she showed up and told me she found them on FB and was waiting for them to accept a message so she could talk to them and \"fix things for me\". I lost my temper and told her to stay out of things that don't fucking concern her. She told me not to curse and she was trying to help. My husband was furious with his mom when he got home. They argued and then his brother got involved and basically said I should have just shut the door in her face and let my husband deal with her.\n\nSo now I'm wondering if he's right and I was wrong to engage and say what I did.

She kept meddling in your business and doing things against your will, which she has no right to do.

I am very sorry for what happened to you and your MIL needs to learn to respect people\u2019s boundaries.", "NTA.  Time off from the MIL is what you need.  Also, she needs to apologize to you.", "NTA\n\nAnd if that's all you said you're a better person than me. It's inexcusable no matter what her intentions.", "Ok, so you cussed out your MIL. I think if you had turned the water hose on her, there on your doorstep, after she told you what she did-you wouldn\u2019t have been out of line.\n\nI\u2019m glad your husband is on your side. I bet he has had a lifetime of \u201cmother knows best\u201d, and is tired of her sticking her nose and interfering where she doesn\u2019t belong. NTA", "She needs to learn what happens when she pushes beyond boundaries that have already been addressed, she probably thinks her expertise is above yours because \u201cshe\u2019s a mother\u201d, she needs a reality check.

If you know that you are going to harbor ill feelings then move forward in a different direction. Let them do their drama somewhere else.", "NTA your mil is a busybody who clearly has nothing better to do than try to mess up your life. Cut her off completely. She clearly doesn\u2019t respect you or your husband.", "That was absolutely the correct response from you. Do not feel guilty. You have politely shut her down multiple times. She knows you don't want her interfering. She deserved more than one curse word.\n\nDon't talk to her until she apologises and agrees to leave you alone about your family. If she forces a meeting between you, move across the country and don't give her your address.\n\nAlso, I'm sorry to hear that about your sister, how awful. And you. Sometimes people are the worst, you deserve better.", "Wow, that\u2019s nuts that MIL would cross that boundary. No, you\u2019re NTA whatsoever.", "NTA. Your MIL crossed a boundary and clearly doesn\u2019t respect your wishes. Not knowing the relationship you have with your MIL, she seems to be having the boomer thought of blood is thicker than water and families members can\u2019t be toxic and cut out of one\u2019s life.

Your MIL is stirring up your life trauma and drama on some sort of self-righteous crusade. Tell her if she needs to feel good about herself and making things good for other people she can volunteer in a kitchen soup or at a local shelter. These people hurt you, their neglect arguably killed your sister. You have spent your entirely formative years trying to grow away from the damage they have done to you and you do not owe them ANYTHING. Not forgiveness, not understanding, not a time of day. And if she insists on siding with the people that hurt you, you won't owe her a thing either.", "NTA. That was a big boundary crossing and trauma you have. It wasn't her place.", "NTA.

Id give her a choice... Either she stops right now, or you will cut her off 100%. If she doesn't respect you... You have your answer. Im sorry you had a painful childhood. Unfortunately... Way to many people blame the affair babies when stuff like this happens, and its never the child's fault. I've seen so many people on this subreddit alone blame the children, or egg on people telling them they don't have to do anything for the affair babies or the \"parents should have thought of this\" before having affairs. Maybe now, after reading your story, they will rethink that attitude.", "NTA \n\nShe needs to mind her own damn business", "NTA. Unless she lived the hell that you did, she shouldn\u2019t involve herself.

This is extremely personal and she has no business in your business.", "Thank you. I feel like it should be very clear why I don't want anything to do with them or why I wouldn't forgive.

They were all perfectly grown adults at the time and everything and it took more than 20 years to do anything about the \"regret\".", "I know and she has done it on multiple occasions at this point.", "My goodness.

I had been open with her about my background and she had some of the questions I consider normal when she heard about it.

Maybe not exactly with the loss of parents and a sibling. But where you won't be accepted or cared about within the extended family because of how you came to be or who your parents are. It's sad. But I think in many cases people don't want to love us. I would say that is especially true for the siblings from the marriage that was destroyed by an affair and I understand it to a point.
