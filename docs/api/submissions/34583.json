They had reached out to say they regretted letting me and my younger sister go into foster care when we were 6 and 2 after our parents died. My sister died in foster care and then I was left totally alone with no family. So having these people reach out now that I'm 29 and haven't seen them in over two decades, it pissed me off. \n\nThe reason for them not taking me is I was my father's affair baby. He was married with kids when he and my mom started an affair and his marriage to his ex wife only came to an end when my mom was 6 months pregnant with me. The fallout meant my father was hated, understandably, but so was I and so was my sister when she was born. I have very vague memories of his older children and none of them pleasant. My father's parents and siblings all sided with his ex wife and the children once my parents died and decided foster care was the only place for us since we had nobody on our maternal side (my mother was a foster kid herself). I saw my grandparents and aunts and uncles at my sister's funeral but she was buried by the state since none of them claimed her body and I was just a child myself so I couldn't.\n\nI had no desire to welcome them into my life or to \"forgive\" and form a relationship.\n\nMy MIL started making comments that I should give them a chance or I will regret it. She said how am I ever supposed to know \"my siblings\" if I don't make the effort. My husband told her to stop. I even told her \"my siblings\" weren't part of the group who reached out and from the limited info I heard they have no interest in establishing anything with me and it sounds like they feel like I should have died with my sister. MIL said it didn't mean I shouldn't try and then she wanted to know their names so she could talk to them. After her not letting up despite my husband telling her multiple times. We decided to take that break from her. Then a little over a week ago she showed up and told me she found them on FB and was waiting for them to accept a message so she could talk to them and \"fix things for me\". I lost my temper and told her to stay out of things that don't fucking concern her. She told me not to curse and she was trying to help. My husband was furious with his mom when he got home. They argued and then his brother got involved and basically said I should have just shut the door in her face and let my husband deal with her.\n\nSo now I'm wondering if he's right and I was wrong to engage and say what I did.
