A more accurate title would be \u201cAre me and my wife the assholes.\u201d Also, obligatory throwaway account.)\n\nMy son David told me that he wants to drop out of high school. He\u2019s not being bullied and enjoys hanging out with his buddies at school. He just doesn\u2019t like waking up at 7:30 everyday and he thinks that school is a waste of time because he finds the teachers boring/annoying and would rather try to become a professional YouTuber. I tried to persuade David, because he has less than a year and a half left of high school. He can still make YouTube videos on the side, but unless he becomes famous, he won't be able to make a living off of it. And it\u2019s impossible to get a decent job or promotion nowadays without a diploma. Plus, if he ever changed his mind about going to college then a high school diploma would give him that option. But David was not listening and said he would just wait until his 18th birthday (in October) when he would be able to drop out without me or his mother\u2019s consent. I spoke to my wife and we then sat down with David. We told David that we would allow him to drop out of school, but if he drops out, he has two choices: Either get a job and start paying rent at 18 or be out of the house. David told us we were being ridiculous because he would never be able to pay the rent we\u2019re asking unless he works two fast food jobs. We told David that that is going to be his reality if he\u2019s a high school dropout. If he wants to be treated as an adult and make a huge adult choice like dropping out of high school, then we will treat him as an adult and let him face adult consequences.\n\nDavid was not happy, but the talk has luckily worked because he says he is no longer going to drop out of high school. Most of the other parents we have talked to said my wife and I did the right thing, because part of being a part is stepping in when your child is about to make a huge mistake. But several other parents have told us that we are being too controlling because David will be a legal adult in a few months and we should let him make his own life choices. My wife and I think letting David drop out of school would be ridiculous and as parents we\u2019re supposed to step in before he makes such a huge mistake. But several people agreed that we were being too controlling, so I want some unbiased perspectives.

Generally I am against expecting one\u2019s child to act like a full fledged adult the moment they turn 18. I think that\u2019s just setting them up for a struggle. But your job as parents is to guide your kid and teach them about consequences and it is important that your son takes a bit and considers how hard things are likely to be for him. Even if he is paying rent to you, you\u2019re likely to still be cheaper and nicer than any landlord he\u2019d find.

If he has decided he doesn't need further training/education to be ready for the workforce, it's 100% reasonable that he be expected to start working to be able to support himself. You are offering the opportunity to live at home if he pays rent but he needs a job to earn money to do that, just as he'd need to have a steady (and probably much higher) income to be able to afford to move out so if he can't earn enough as a \"YouTuber\" to even pay what I'm sure is much lower room & board to stay at home than he'd have to earn to support himself living away from home, then he should apply what he's learned form his life lesson.

Six months before my 18th birthday (birthday is in March), my parents told me I could live in their house rent free until August 2 (graduation was June 2).  That gave me two months to 1) go to college, 2) join the military, or 3) get a job.  Option 1 would allow me to live rent free in exchange for sweat equity (my parents have 11 acres, there were tons of chores to be done).  Option 2 would give me guest privileges when I was home on leave. Option 3 carried a nominal rent which would still allow me to save money if I had a full time or two part time jobs.  I chose Option 1 and started college June 12th, but moved in with my grandparents because they were closer to my university.  I handled all kinds of chores for them (although they insisted on continuing to do lots of things for themselves because they were still very independent).

Not too controlling. You simply let him know what the consequences for his actions were going to be. Fortunately, he saw the light.

Really, I\u2019m not paying to enable stupid behavior, especially if it has great potential to harm them.", "NTA in my personal view we need to change our mind set about 18 being an adult.  Yes at 18 kids can do a lot of adult things and have choices but if your still in high school is that being ready to be an adult?  Personally I think parents should look at this (especially in countries where you cannot drink till 21) at 18 kids get to practice being an adult, they can try things out make mistakes but with a parental safty net till they are 21.  Considering many kids stay in education until 21 and most cannot afford to move out till 21 the expectation of patents to have fully independent functional adults at 18 in places when their education doesn't Finnish till then is unreasonable.  I have already noticed a behaviour change in the young adults in the UK between thoughs who expected formal education to end at 16 and who formal education ended at 18.", "NTA\n\nYou did things right!

It wasn't stated explicitly in the post but the parents, unconsciously or consciously, recognized their son failed at evaluating the risk of his decision to forsake all other careers at a critical time and the consequences of it not panning out. Dropping out of high school would mean ultimately he would nearly-certainly need to get his GED anyway in order to pick back up where he left off (assuming his YouTube aspirations did not meet his expectations, which is the most likely case, statistically).

When David becomes a senior and needs to begin looking at career or college options, I feel you\u2019re going to have the same conversation about not wanting to do anything. In sum, the problem won\u2019t go away. Can you help him find something he\u2019s passionate about and create a plan around this? If he\u2019s grounded in the real world rather than academia, I\u2019d start having discussions around potential careers and then work backwards.

As soon as they were done with school however they needed to pay a small amount of rent or move out.  It worked really well.  I now have responsible kids that take care of themselves. One stayed home and paid rent until he was 24 and saved up money.  One came back to get on their feet for a few months paid rent and got back on their feet by being able to save money.

I probably would not have had any issue with it, personally. But graduating is not particularly difficult, to be perfectly honest. OP's son is simply making an impulsive decision, which tends to suggest he'd do better to graduate through the system rather than sign himself up to take a test that he'd be 2 years behind on the material to pass. And let's be honest, if he's not paying attention in class and wants to drop out to be a YouTube star, chances are he isn't the gifted-and-talented-all-classes-are-easy-so-I-dont-pay-attention kind of student. Which there isn't anything wrong with that. But he'd be shooting himself in the foot taking the easy way out today and setting himself up for something probably harder later to get back to status quo. That's why I felt like adding some food for thought to this comment thread."]}
