A more accurate title would be \u201cAre me and my wife the assholes.\u201d Also, obligatory throwaway account.)\n\nMy son David told me that he wants to drop out of high school. He\u2019s not being bullied and enjoys hanging out with his buddies at school. He just doesn\u2019t like waking up at 7:30 everyday and he thinks that school is a waste of time because he finds the teachers boring/annoying and would rather try to become a professional YouTuber. I tried to persuade David, because he has less than a year and a half left of high school. He can still make YouTube videos on the side, but unless he becomes famous, he won't be able to make a living off of it. And it\u2019s impossible to get a decent job or promotion nowadays without a diploma. Plus, if he ever changed his mind about going to college then a high school diploma would give him that option. But David was not listening and said he would just wait until his 18th birthday (in October) when he would be able to drop out without me or his mother\u2019s consent. I spoke to my wife and we then sat down with David. We told David that we would allow him to drop out of school, but if he drops out, he has two choices: Either get a job and start paying rent at 18 or be out of the house. David told us we were being ridiculous because he would never be able to pay the rent we\u2019re asking unless he works two fast food jobs. We told David that that is going to be his reality if he\u2019s a high school dropout. If he wants to be treated as an adult and make a huge adult choice like dropping out of high school, then we will treat him as an adult and let him face adult consequences.\n\nDavid was not happy, but the talk has luckily worked because he says he is no longer going to drop out of high school. Most of the other parents we have talked to said my wife and I did the right thing, because part of being a part is stepping in when your child is about to make a huge mistake. But several other parents have told us that we are being too controlling because David will be a legal adult in a few months and we should let him make his own life choices. My wife and I think letting David drop out of school would be ridiculous and as parents we\u2019re supposed to step in before he makes such a huge mistake. But several people agreed that we were being too controlling, so I want some unbiased perspectives.

The point of his business plan is to demonstrate to you that the numbers work. If he can\u2019t make the numbers work, then he needs to stay in school until he can come up with a better plan where the numbers *do* work.

Maybe he should try looking at the bright side of things when it comes to that. And, hey! You guys gave him a decent choice!

The big stars almost all have post-graduate degrees, usually a masters but some have doctorates. To be successful in media you need to be highly educated, motivated, and persistent to the point of bull headedness. Particularly if you're working independent media like youtube or twitch.

You have to look for and come up with content which requires so much time worth of brainstorming. Not only that, you also need to be able to do video editing; it isn't typically just snapping a video with your phone and done, you have to do touch-ups, graphic design, editing! Then, in order to build a presence you need to be active. You need to interact with people following you. Depending on the content you also need to be active on various platforms. Remember, in order to make any headway at all you don't just do this once; you need to post PLENTY of content.

Green screens, lighting, decent computers, etc.) I don't know how he manages to juggle both and get the sleep he needs...this youtuber gig is a second, full-time job. \n\nMy point is, its hard work to become successful as a youtuber. If he thinks he will make a living so easily that its worth quitting his job over, he may as well drive to hollywood and ask to replace Ryan Reynolds in his next Marvel Movie. It's about the same level of cockiness.\n\nMy younger brother on the other hand...well, he did drop out of highschool thinking he could make it on his own. He did have a certification from the vocational program, and he did get a job at one of the chain dealerships...it was discovered later on why the boss hired him;\n\nFrankly, the boss saw a young adult with knowledge, and he knew that due to his lack of diploma most employers in the industry would turn him down. He hired my brother on at half (no benefits) of what the other employees of his position made while baiting him with a promise of a payraise...which he never received. He knew that without that diploma, my brother would not be able to find anybody who would pay him better in that industry...and he was right.
