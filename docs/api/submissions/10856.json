A more accurate title would be \u201cAre me and my wife the assholes.\u201d Also, obligatory throwaway account.)\n\nMy son David told me that he wants to drop out of high school. He\u2019s not being bullied and enjoys hanging out with his buddies at school. He just doesn\u2019t like waking up at 7:30 everyday and he thinks that school is a waste of time because he finds the teachers boring/annoying and would rather try to become a professional YouTuber. I tried to persuade David, because he has less than a year and a half left of high school. He can still make YouTube videos on the side, but unless he becomes famous, he won't be able to make a living off of it. And it\u2019s impossible to get a decent job or promotion nowadays without a diploma. Plus, if he ever changed his mind about going to college then a high school diploma would give him that option. But David was not listening and said he would just wait until his 18th birthday (in October) when he would be able to drop out without me or his mother\u2019s consent. I spoke to my wife and we then sat down with David. We told David that we would allow him to drop out of school, but if he drops out, he has two choices: Either get a job and start paying rent at 18 or be out of the house. David told us we were being ridiculous because he would never be able to pay the rent we\u2019re asking unless he works two fast food jobs. We told David that that is going to be his reality if he\u2019s a high school dropout. If he wants to be treated as an adult and make a huge adult choice like dropping out of high school, then we will treat him as an adult and let him face adult consequences.\n\nDavid was not happy, but the talk has luckily worked because he says he is no longer going to drop out of high school. Most of the other parents we have talked to said my wife and I did the right thing, because part of being a part is stepping in when your child is about to make a huge mistake. But several other parents have told us that we are being too controlling because David will be a legal adult in a few months and we should let him make his own life choices. My wife and I think letting David drop out of school would be ridiculous and as parents we\u2019re supposed to step in before he makes such a huge mistake. But several people agreed that we were being too controlling, so I want some unbiased perspectives.

I mean he could do general labor or something.

I'll go NAH, because David is still a kid and kid's have whims like this all the time.

We've all wanted to be YouTubers or authors or singers, but we're not all Markiplier or Beyonce.", "NTA \n\nYou gave him clearly defined options and he chose  wisely. You did proper parenting by redirecting him to focus on what's his best future outcome should be. Education and a diploma.", "NTA. You and your wife are parenting. If David doesn\u2019t like your rules then he can move out. The other parents who disagree with you probably have that same rule with their own older teens.

If he's dropping out of High School because he doesn't want to get up at 7:30, I don't think that bodes well for his YouTube career. \n\nI mean, yes, when YouTube was less saturated, you could just be someone who just talks shit and become famous. But not only was a lot of that fame short-lived but there is just more competition out there now!\n\nSo I think you took the right approach.
