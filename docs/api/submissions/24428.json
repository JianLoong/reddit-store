Your SIL is though. It is intentional and just an all around shitty thing to do. You are wonderful for having your wife's back.", "YWBTA. This is a typical example of 1 person projecting their insecurities onto everyone else and expecting them to just accept it. No. The only person with a problem here is your wife, the very notion of suggesting that someone else literally make a lifelong, life altering decision about their own family just to make her own life slightly moreconvenient, is incredibly selfish and entitled. This is no different than if your wife showed up to a massive barbecue with 50 people and threw all of the food in the garbage because it makes her uncomfortable and just expecting everyone else to be fine with it. No. Your wife's trauma doesnt give her an excuse to interfere in everyone else's lives. And threatening to never be part of their lives again comes across as very manipulative to me. If it's such a problem for your wife then simply dont be part of their lives.. you don't have to threaten them and try to force them to use a different name. the only one being malicious here is your wife, I cant believe the comments I'm reading. Also this isnt being done to \"get a rise\" out of your wife, it's being done because SIL likes the name. Idk how you fail to understand that by now. Shes tried to name multiple babies that and your wife liked the name, makes sense her sister would too. If anything naming a child that name would be more like paying respect to what happened to your wife rather than antagonizing her. Your wife is just playing the victim and you and most of the commentors here have fallen for it.", "Yes, YWBTA. SiL and BiL deserve to name their child as they wish. This is not about you wife.

And hospitals now have mental health support for any late term loss. \n\nOPs wife did that alone. No meds, no nothing. And in hiding. Her family is the reason for her pain and shame. \n\nOP, this name is not a choice for anyone in your wife\u2019s family.

That is some next-level sociopathic behavior, to bring up something so traumatic all the time.  Does she even like your wife?

She is \u201cshutting down\u201d -usually dissociating- when this comes up. That is a strategy that has served so well to protect her from her awful family and traumatic delivery of a stillborn child by herself. \n\nYou are correct to cut them of from repeatedly throwing her trauma in her face. And you can both heal and move forward through therapy as she learns that she no longer needs to cut herself off from reality\u2026 because once her family isn\u2019t haunting and hurting her, reality doesn\u2019t have to be so ugly or scary!!", "To me, the word stillbirth has a lot more emotional charge to it than miscarriage. A miscarriage is sad and terrible, but a stillbirth is horrific. It may be your wife's way of distancing herself somewhat from that trauma", "That makes it SO much worse.  You seriously need to talk to your wife about cutting contact with her sister.  Her cruelty is not good for your wife, and it probably won\u2019t EVER stop.  SIL seems to be trying to punish your wife for her \u201csins\u201d, using her trauma to do it.  That is not ok.", "More likely she doesn\u2019t have the words because she was never under medical care.

How can anyone be so awful & to their own sister, no less?", "NTA, the worst part of this is the fact that the sister has any kids!!", "Good for you to stick up for your wife.  At seven months that a still birth and can of course be very traumatic even in a hospital but can't imagine going through that and being alone at home.  I hope you wife is having trauma counseling.  Cutting them out of your life is drastic but you have to do what is best for your wife.", "NTA, your sister in law is a giant ah. She is horrible for doing that. She clearly knows what she is doing. Why is this person in your life?", "This is between your wife and her sister. I think you should stay out of it unless your wife asks for your help.

You cannot make that decision alone.", "In my native language a stillbirth is literally called a \u201cdeadborn\u201d and that\u2019s what it is - the poor mother had to give birth to a dead child.

She\u2019s throwing out a code word that she knows is a trigger for her sisters trauma for amusement. If she really cared about using it out of respect she would approach her sister and respectfully ask her to do so.\n\nEven worse is that this is the fifth time it\u2019s happened.

I feel so bad for your wife!", "She definitely needs support to work through the trauma, but I'd strongly object to the idea that she has some kind of obligation to embrace the medically correct terminology for what happened to her.

You are right.There is no obligation for OPs wife to use medically or socially preferred terms. I am not trying to rewrite her trauma or telling her what language to use around it. You are right that it\u2019s her trauma and she can describe it however she chooses. \n\nWhat I am advocating for is an understanding that there is standardized language for what happened to her that she wasn\u2019t exposed to because she had to endure her ordeal as a young woman with no support or healthcare. By herself. In a place. I am not arguing semantics, but that she was robbed of the basic right to clinically accurate language to describe her trauma. \n\nShe would have heard the term \u201cstillbirth\u201d if she had been lucky enough to have been able to seek healthcare for her emergency delivery. Instead, she pieced together the words to describe what happened to her body and because words have meaning she has most likely compared her experience of delivering a deceased 7 month old stillborn child to the miscarriages of friends, family and internet strangers. The language matters *because* women go through a whole range of things. \n\nI am making assumptions based on my own personal experience with unexpected pregnancy and as a healthcare provider, that OPs wife will be liberated by clinically accurate language that sets her experience apart from what we usually mean when we say \u201cmiscarriage.\u201d\n\nETA: more kindness", "Because she still judges her sister for being an unwed, pregnant child and never wants her to forget that she (SIL) is the \"good\" one for having a litter within the bonds of matrimony like God intended.", "THIS!", "Your wife needs to accept the things that have happened and make peace with it all\u2026.
