My wife and her sister talked before baby #1 (I wasn't in the picture at the time). \n\nMy wife is dealing with issues at work today, so I didn't want to drag her back into it. I didn't include my SIL because I don't have her number. My BIL generally have a good rapport, so that's why I wanted to talk to him first to see 1) if it's really true or if it's something my SIL said to anger my wife, and 2) if he forgot about the conversation we've had in the past.", "There's a bit of a difference in encountering the name in the wild and having a family member choosing that name while knowing the history. Just a bit.", "Your approach has merit but do not lose sight that at some point you and your wife may need to be a united front on their behavior re: 'Nancy'. Best to you!", "Not just any family member, but a sister", "Oof seven months in is not a miscarriage, it\u2019s a stillbirth. That\u2019s a really horrific experience. She gave birth to an actual baby. I\u2019m so sorry she went through that and her sister is being so unkind about it.", "INFO: Is there a reason behind the sister's interest in the name? Is it perhaps the name of another deceased family member she was close to? Or a name she'd already chosen for her future child before everything happened with the stillbirth?\n\nI'm just struggling to see why she'd keep bringing it up if there's not something you're leaving out of the story.", "Honestly they're not As to use it. And your wife isn't an A to ask them not to use it either. But to *demand* they not use it, to say you'll avoid them entirely if they do... that's a bit far for me. She could get therapy, after all, that seems like a better route to make her happier going forward?\n\nI don't think they've picked the name specifically to piss off your wife. They clearly just love the name and have already tried to use it several times. But I'm not going to make a judgement here because this is a very complicated and heated scenario.", "NTA  Jesus. Your SIL is though. It is intentional and just an all around shitty thing to do. You are wonderful for having your wife's back.", "YWBTA. This is a typical example of 1 person projecting their insecurities onto everyone else and expecting them to just accept it. No. The only person with a problem here is your wife, the very notion of suggesting that someone else literally make a lifelong, life altering decision about their own family just to make her own life slightly moreconvenient, is incredibly selfish and entitled. This is no different than if your wife showed up to a massive barbecue with 50 people and threw all of the food in the garbage because it makes her uncomfortable and just expecting everyone else to be fine with it. No. Your wife's trauma doesnt give her an excuse to interfere in everyone else's lives. And threatening to never be part of their lives again comes across as very manipulative to me. If it's such a problem for your wife then simply dont be part of their lives.. you don't have to threaten them and try to force them to use a different name. the only one being malicious here is your wife, I cant believe the comments I'm reading. Also this isnt being done to \"get a rise\" out of your wife, it's being done because SIL likes the name. Idk how you fail to understand that by now. Shes tried to name multiple babies that and your wife liked the name, makes sense her sister would too. If anything naming a child that name would be more like paying respect to what happened to your wife rather than antagonizing her. Your wife is just playing the victim and you and most of the commentors here have fallen for it.", "Yes, YWBTA. SiL and BiL deserve to name their child as they wish. This is not about you wife. Do not create a rift over this.", "First, you wife has a still birth, not a miscarriage.\n\nSecond, I assume the sister was aware of what your wife endured.  If not maybe someone should take with her.\n\nI agree with other comments.  The sister is doing this intentionally to shame your wife.\n\nGo NC / LC with the whole family.", "NTA \n\nAnd a hero for your wife. But I would cut them out anyway. Her sister is just being psychotic and cruel to your wife. She knows what she's doing, you don't need then in your life.", "NTA They already knew why that name caused trauma and are continuing to antagonize with it. Just cut them out of your life already.", "NTA. \n\nI wonder though, is the name your wife\u2019s grandmother\u2019s name or something like that, that makes your SIL so keen on wanting to use it?", "NTA- your wife had a stillborn. That\u2019s so incredibly traumatic and it\u2019s cruel of your SIL to suggest using the same name.", "NTA cut them out regardless, her sister sounds like a monster.", "I\u2019m confused, would this be Nancy #5?", "I\u2019m confused, would this be Nancy #5? Or have they never actually ended up using the name once the baby is born?", "Your wife's sister is acting terribly, and she *knows* it. Very much NTA. I honestly would recommend that your wife consider limiting contact with that sister anyway.", "NTA\n\nYou guys need to go no contact. Like many others have said she is only bringing it up in order to trigger your wife\u2019s trauma. And she\u2019s done this 5 times in a row? Straight up evil shit if you ask me.", "At this point, I would probably go no contact.  What type of person would do that. . . Five times??  I can't imagine why you would want to have contact with her at all.", "And she was 7 months along so it was a stillbirth for a teenager alone & terrified, scared of the people who should\u2019ve been her support system. It sounds like hell on earth & she was just a kid. The BIL already knows his wife is scary level of cruel but hasn\u2019t done anything to intervene.\n\n\nOP would be better off gently explaining to his wife that her sister is a deadly level of toxic & needs to be out of their lives.", "I apologize for miswording. It's not something that her and I often talk about so I never realized there was a difference. From what I remembered in the past she has called it a miscarriage, so that's why I used that.", "The name has no relation to anyone else in the family. Growing up, my wife had expressed that she always wanted a daughter with that name, and her sister \"always hated (the name)\". It wasn't until she was pregnant with baby #1 that her sister ever expressed interest in using that name. To my knowledge, she's brought it up with at least baby #1, baby #4, and now baby #5. I don't know if there's any reasoning behind it, other than it gets a rise out of my wife.", "No relation to anyone in the family, at least on their side. I'm not sure about my BIL's family.", "They have never actually used the name. But for babies #1 #4 and now #5, they've said they want to use it, then they've changed it.", "Also, the *police investigation* is what forced  her to even name this secret-because-of-shame-and-fear stillbirth that she managed alone. Managing an early pregnancy loss is hard enough. Delivering a stillborn child carries all of the same pain as a regular delivery if not more. And hospitals now have mental health support for any late term loss. \n\nOPs wife did that alone. No meds, no nothing. And in hiding. Her family is the reason for her pain and shame. \n\nOP, this name is not a choice for anyone in your wife\u2019s family. If they don\u2019t understand, they are likely perpetuating the same morally abusive behaviors that caused your wife this trauma in the first place. Don\u2019t argue or explain or plead. Their cruelty is obvious to every stranger in this thread. It is also clear to them and at this point *the cruelty is the point*\n\nDon\u2019t fuck around with these assholes any longer.\n\nNTA.", "Yikes. Well if it's not some sort of misunderstanding and she really is just trying to hurt your wife, that's definitely behaviour worth cutting her off over.", "Your SIL is just malicious then. Going no or low contact may be for the best anyway :/"]}
