I\u2019ve been going through a lot so I will try to make this as brief as possible. \n\nI (36M) have been married to my wife (37F) for almost seven years but we\u2019ve been together for 10. We\u2019ve had very high highs and very low lows. Things have been worse in the past than they are now. My wife has a temper and I tend to shut down. \n\nDuring the course of the last 5 years or so, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer.   During our last blowout argument, where my wife was pushing me to talk to her I said I would rather divorce her than do what she wanted me to do (for the record, it was to apply to higher paying jobs. I have a graduate degree but I\u2019ve been biding my time for the right position to find me rather than going out there to look for anything.) My wife got upset who then called my mother, crying and complaining about me. Again, she was sick and the doctor told her she needed to avoid stress. \n\nI laid into my wife and lost a fair amount of respect for her. She asked me for a divorce and it seems like that\u2019s where we were headed, but after a couple months, we were communicating better, that seemed to melt away and we became loving again. My wife did end up apologizing to my mother and they were on good terms. \n\nMy mother took a turn for the worst and sent my wife a check to be used for airfare for Christmas to come visit, however, the terrible, inevitable has happened and my mother passed. My wife flew me down to be with her before the end but not before, in my opinion, starting an argument about my drinking. (The disagreement started two days before the emergency flight, and subsided the next day because I refused to talk to her about it.)\n\nWhen I got home, and she asked about flying to my hometown for the holidays, I told her that she needed to use that check mom sent in her name for my half of the mortgage and she would need to pay for her airfare out of her own pocket. In my view, that money is coming from my parents, therefore, it\u2019s mine. This way she\u2019s still benefitting, it\u2019s going towards the house. \n\nWhen I told my wife this, I could tell she was upset but she didn\u2019t press the issue. I can see why I WBTA, but considering it\u2019s going to a shared expense, I think it\u2019s a wash.", "created_utc": 1701188442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185zvzd/aita_for_taking_my_wifes_gift/", "score": 1760, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Based on your wife being upset about your drinking, and the fact you had no money, and the fact your mom provided funds for you to fly to visit *in your wife\u2019s name and control* it sounds like you can\u2019t be trusted with money because you\u2019re an alcoholic who will spend it on that.

Because your parent's know you are an asshole and wouldn't use it as you should.

You would rather divorce your wife than to get off your ass and look for a steady, good paying job. That's one of the laziest and assholish things I've read lately. \n3.

Now you want her to share it. Regardless of whether that is the fair thing to do or not, it is not what your mother intended.", "YTA.\n\nYour mother sent a check to your wife, enough for 2 plane tickets home.\n\nWhat that tells me, is that your own mother didn't trust you with money, and wanted to see the both of you before she died.\n\nYou used your ticket.

I hope your wife leaves you and gets therapy.", "YTA. I can tell from your writing that you're minimizing your faults that the wife is upset about. You shutting down is an excuse to not work or confront the issues. Not stepping up and getting a better job sounds like avoidance of responsibility.  \n\nEverything about this post reaks of how the world should revolve around your feelings and needs. The only redeeming thing you did was offer your wife a divorce.  I hope she takes your offer and moves on.", "YTA\n\nYou don't like your wife. You're petty.

The fact that you want her to give it to you so you can buy shit for yourself only proves that she was right not to trust you in the first place.

I can't imagine having to have one of their future spouses call me with a 'You have to take him back; I'm done waiting for him to grow up' call. That's what it sounds like: you don't want to work (but are capable), someone else should foot the bill for you to 'be happy' and if someone else has a problem with your drinking then that's their problem.\n\nYou have a lot to potentially lose.

This way she\u2019s still benefitting, it\u2019s going towards the house.\n\nSo now you're not only an asshole, you're forcing her to pay for YOUR agreed portion of the mortgage because it's your mom that sent the money, thus forcing her to pay for her ticket to your hometown. You have a very sick way of justifying spousal abuse, sir. Because that is what it is here. (EDIT: I'm a fair gal. You're asking her to use this to pay your half of the mortgage and have her pay her flight, fine, that's not check fraud, that just is an even worse case of spousal abuse, which still should land your ass in county jail.

Alimony is usually only in cases where one party can\u2019t provide for themselves immediately after divorce (stay at home parents/spouses, etc) or extreme income disparities. It\u2019s also usually temporary, generally a year for the states I\u2019m licensed in. The supported spouse can go back to court to extend it, but, in my experience, judges don\u2019t look favorably on that barring extreme circumstances. Oh, and that assumes he\u2019s not going to be paying child support, since she will obviously get primary custody. Though he seems the type to fight for more custody solely to lessen his child support", "That's a lot of words to say you are ok victim blaming when it's someone you disagree with. Disgusting.", "He can\u2019t afford it.", "Hard to afford a flight when you have a habit to finance.", "100%. it\u2019s clear his wife\u2019s behavior is based on his stonewalling and alcoholism and therefore entirely understandable", "Totally agree. Pretty impressive to see so many people calling this guy an asshole and he\u2019s still trying to rationalize things to people? This feels like a nomination for year end awards in ??? drunk logic.", "My current primary Dr is like \ud83d\udc4d okay so long as it helps. Sorry you're still dealing with chronic pain; the chronic pain clinic is like \ud83d\ude21 bad girl. Your smoking indicates you're an addict. Meditate and try acupuncture instead. \u0130 even told them I'd stop smoking if I could get actual pain relief, so obviously I'm just seeking drugs. After 7 years of dealing with daily pain..\n\nSpoiler: alternative medicines do not work for my flavor of disability, especially fucking acupuncture which took me **out** for over a week; someone drug me please I've tried it all", "I'm hoping she was just waiting for her mil to pass so the poor woman didn't get saddled with this asshole moving into live with her.", "You should ask again. Just to be extra extra sure lol", "Asked and answered.", "If that was true so many people wouldn\u2019t be abused and trapped in relationships that they see no way out of. Some people are *that* good at seeming nice, honest and caring until the door slams behind you. It has nothing to do with being naive. \n\nThe world is not black and white and some people are good and honest, but others are fantastic liars and manipulators. Sometimes it *is* hard to tell them apart. \n\nHaving said that, you should read my comment with a grain of salt. Whilst I do think marrying someone like that guy is a nightmare situation, I was more making a point than advocating against marriage as a whole.", "I couldn't believe that.

Surprised he didn't find his shit packed and on the doorstep after that one.", "Unfortunately true, it is a miserable experience for everyone involved\ud83d\ude2aI genuinely hope OP is able to realize he has a serious problem and that his wife deserves better, whether that\u2019s him fixing his shit or her leaving his ass behind for better things.", "Yup I absolutely agree, it is dependent on jurisdiction.

It\u2019s what happens when you are broken down over time by someone\u2019s constant abuse. Cope. If you can\u2019t.. Maybe talk to a therapist? Do you need help? If you can\u2019t educate yourself, maybe therapize yourself, buddy. Good luck in the real world. I figure you\u2019ll be spending most of your time here, online, in the dark corners of the internet where you can\u2019t be rejected in quite literally every social setting.", "No it's just nuance. Most situations have them. This one is backed by research.", "Agreed, even trying to be impartial and it makes me unsderstand his logic because he\u2019s not 50% wrong he\u2019s 100% wrong. And the fact that he isn\u2019t even defending the fact and even stated that the ticket was being bought for his wife. Sounds like he feels entitled because HIS mom, HIS wife\u2026 common denominator is HIS\u2026", "I mean the answer just changed, soooo it was worth asking again.", "I'm sorry your normalcy is so fucked up.", "I agree. Some people can change years after marriage.", "Ah fair. I do think many people rush into marriage very young and very quickly. There are lots of reasons for that, but I think a large number of failed relationships could be avoided if people really got to know people before marriage. I will say I'm on the extreme end of this. I was with my husband for 12 years before we got married. I know not everyone will be together for over a decade before getting married, but I DO think that getting married before 25, getting married before 3 years together, and getting married before living together are recipes for divorce.", "They said \"if you're actually looking,\" though. Many people are trapped in unhappy relationships because they're not looking at the start. They're seeing what they want to see,  and letting the romantic feelings they're swept up in make excuses for things that should be obvious red flags. \n\nIt doesn't make them bad people, but the saying \"love is blind\" exists for a reason.", "You\u2019re not wrong. But I think you can know eventually. When I was 19, I dated a guy who completely changed as soon as I changed a little, and who wanted to control me. This was after 6 months of being totally different. I\u2019m married to the guy I dated after him, but was really wary of getting married for 15 years, and just wouldn\u2019t talk about it. So I think you can eventually know, if you are really extreme about avoiding another reversal like that by refusing to trust anyone (I also have an older brother who is very controlling and abusive, so I just have trust issues. And this brother was in an accident and is dependent on my parents and more violent now, and I truly thought that no one decent would allow someone they love to marry into a family like mine). Which isn\u2019t really a healthy alternative, so I\u2019m not throwing it out as advice. \n\nI think you can avoid getting into these relationships, but only by severely limiting your options and living something like a half-life. Which isn\u2019t much healthier than the alternative. The only advice I feel qualified to give is that if your partner is abusing you now it truly doesn\u2019t matter if they were amazing for decades beforehand- people can change or could have been putting on an act, no matter how much you loved that act. Never stay in a place/with a person who makes you feel unsafe at all. You can get a new husband or apologize and explain if your \u201chinky\u201d feeling was wrong- you can\u2019t get a new you and neither can the people who love you.", "The overwhelming majority of the time, the signs are there and they\u2019re not particularly hidden. Fact is, most people who get caught up in these marriages have ignored the red flags. Low self esteem, loneliness and denial can lead us down dark roads. I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t happen, but the \u201cI was duped by this very intelligent, charismatic, highly skilled manipulator!!\u201d is the minority of cases. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say the people on the receiving end of the abusive AHs are deserving of it, or that they\u2019re \u201cstupid\u201d or that it couldn\u2019t happen to most people at some point in their lives. Just that their blindness is a symptom of some underlying issues that they have going on internally.", "Ahh I've heard victim blaming get called a lot of things, but I'm actually surprised you're the first one to say victim blaming is nuance lol.", "The answer did not change. A regular occurrence and normal, understandable behavior from a frustrated person dealing with an alcoholic who refuses to communicate are two very different things.", "You\u2019re ridiculous \ud83d\ude02 nowhere did I say this is regular occurrence in my life.", "Why are you defending a drunken bum?", "I was with my partner for 7 years before he became an abusive alcoholic in his 30s. \n\nIt\u2019s not as easy as \u201cjust don\u2019t date shitty people!\u201d", "I don\u2019t disagree that people should take their time getting to know each other. I\u2019m a slow and steady type myself.

Cause a whole lot of them do. \n\nSure, some people are trapped in unhappy relationships because of various dysfunctional reasons, but saying that it\u2019s naive and you can see who they are if you just look is not a one size fits all and not an accurate depiction of the world we live in.", "Eventually, yeah. Unfortunately the damage is often done at that point and leaving sometimes comes with a steep price. \n\nLike you say, the cost of avoidance is high. A half life is no life at all and gives nobody an honest chance. \n\nI\u2019m so happy you found a safe place \u2764\ufe0f", "And you\u2019re basing that on what? Since you say it\u2019s fact, then you must have sources for this claim?", "I agree with you wholeheartedly. I\u2019ve seen so many people just wanting to get married, or at least thinking they should, that they completely ignore big waving red flags. I\u2019ve even seen their friends/fam encouraging this as they too are desperate for the person to get married. \n\nWe have a weird obsession in society with singledom and that anything is seen as better than being as such. Being unattached is equated with being alone, unloved and ultimately defective. That is a very pervasive reason on why we collectively encourage little probing into romantic matches, until it\u2019s too late.", "Hope the view is really nice up there on that high horse lol", "So it's not normal then.", "I'm not sure how this is a defense lol", "This! \n\nOr people who don't get that alcoholism is progressive. Trust me, when I married my stbx, he wasn't drinking every day. That started later and only got worse from there.", "It's a story we all hear too often, I'm sorry you had to deal with it personally. I didn't know entirely what my husband was until after I divorced him. Only naive fools thinks it's as easy as \" just don't date shitty people\".", "You, too, huh? I was 7 years into our marriage when he suddenly started changing and went from loving to verbally, emotionally, and financially abusive. He'd finally developed bipolar 1 (runs in his family) and went off the deep end. Didn't leave until literally year 11 (ON our anniversary day). It sucks. So much can change over time, and it's very sad. Divorcing him was the best thing I've ever done, though, and the only regret I have was not doing it sooner, but I didn't want to look like a \"failure\" to my very religious family.", "I agree with that and I didn't mean it to be an absolute. Addiction is such a messy disease and it's so much harder to spot in someone who isn't actively engaging in addictive behaviors. I'm really sorry you went through that, and I know how hard it is to watch someone you thought you knew slowly slip away. \n\n\n\n I suppose my opinion is also jaded because I have seen so many people jump into relationships with walking red flags and then act so shocked when things go sideways, and they always say \"they weren't like that when we got married\" and I have to bite my tongue bc I'm sitting here like \"Yes they were and multiple people told you they were\". And I know it's easier for me to spot these behaviors bc I was surrounded by abuse for so long, but it still kills me to see people I love do what feels like walking into a condemned building knowing at any moment it could collapse and they act like I'm the crazy one for pointing out the red flags.", "Oh, absolutely. That's not how I meant it and I absolutely realize sometimes people change drastically, especially after a traumatic event, and sometimes it's much harder to tell when someone is hiding something (though I do think it's much harder to hide who you are if you live with someone). I also know at least 3 people personally who say \"He changed so dramatically! I never saw it coming\" where all of our friends were slow blinking bc we saw the signs a mile away for YEARS. In fact, for 2 of them we TOLD THEM before they got married that we saw the signs and they still acted blindsided. Now, would I ever tell them that? No, they're grieving their relationship and the love and life they had. I'm not gonna be a dick and say \" I mean, we tried to tell you he had some major red flags\". That's not helpful and it's just mean. But I do think that lots of people overlook things in people they love that outsiders see clearly.", "Here\u2019s your [sOuRcE](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20fact%20of%20the%20matter%20is)", "What, you mean not everyone who\u2019s married to an abusive asshole was simply duped by a highly intelligent and charismatic, American Psycho-esque manipulator?????\n\nI\u2019ve also seen this play out time and time again, with predictable results. People want what they want, and for a myriad of reasons, will ignore red flags that might impede them getting what they want. It\u2019s very true that singledom is treated like a disease state, and a lot of people just want to be loved and fear being alone. They will gloss over those inconvenient red flags and remain in denial that things are \u201cthat bad\u201d, or just hope that in the end, this person will change or be better and they\u2019ll live happily ever after. A lot of the times, we lie to ourselves and don\u2019t even consciously acknowledge the obvious. \n\nBut no, I\u2019m sorry, the guy with 3 \u201ccrazy!\u201d baby mamas, a recent substance abuse \u201crecovery\u201d and spotty employment history who broke your phone 90 days into your relationship was not a \u201chow could I have known!!!\u201d situation.", "I'm tall, I don't need a horse to have a great view."]}
