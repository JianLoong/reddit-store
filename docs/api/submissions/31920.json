I\u2019ve been going through a lot so I will try to make this as brief as possible. \n\nI (36M) have been married to my wife (37F) for almost seven years but we\u2019ve been together for 10. We\u2019ve had very high highs and very low lows. Things have been worse in the past than they are now. My wife has a temper and I tend to shut down. \n\nDuring the course of the last 5 years or so, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer.   During our last blowout argument, where my wife was pushing me to talk to her I said I would rather divorce her than do what she wanted me to do (for the record, it was to apply to higher paying jobs. I have a graduate degree but I\u2019ve been biding my time for the right position to find me rather than going out there to look for anything.) My wife got upset who then called my mother, crying and complaining about me. Again, she was sick and the doctor told her she needed to avoid stress. \n\nI laid into my wife and lost a fair amount of respect for her. She asked me for a divorce and it seems like that\u2019s where we were headed, but after a couple months, we were communicating better, that seemed to melt away and we became loving again. My wife did end up apologizing to my mother and they were on good terms. \n\nMy mother took a turn for the worst and sent my wife a check to be used for airfare for Christmas to come visit, however, the terrible, inevitable has happened and my mother passed. My wife flew me down to be with her before the end but not before, in my opinion, starting an argument about my drinking. (The disagreement started two days before the emergency flight, and subsided the next day because I refused to talk to her about it.)\n\nWhen I got home, and she asked about flying to my hometown for the holidays, I told her that she needed to use that check mom sent in her name for my half of the mortgage and she would need to pay for her airfare out of her own pocket. In my view, that money is coming from my parents, therefore, it\u2019s mine. This way she\u2019s still benefitting, it\u2019s going towards the house. \n\nWhen I told my wife this, I could tell she was upset but she didn\u2019t press the issue. I can see why I WBTA, but considering it\u2019s going to a shared expense, I think it\u2019s a wash.", "created_utc": 1701188442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185zvzd/aita_for_taking_my_wifes_gift/", "score": 190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You threaten divorce when your wife asks you to step up, and tries to communicate with you\n\n3.

You are controlling, telling her how to spend the money your mother gave her that was intended for a specific purpose \n\n5. Based on your wife being upset about your drinking, and the fact you had no money, and the fact your mom provided funds for you to fly to visit *in your wife\u2019s name and control* it sounds like you can\u2019t be trusted with money because you\u2019re an alcoholic who will spend it on that.

You\u2019re just waiting for a magical job to drop in your lap? \n\nAnd it sounds like your wife already paid for your flight, you stated \u2018my wife flew me down\u2019 so it sounds like your wife already paid for your emergency flight, just not at Christmas for what are obvious reasons.", "Yta you drink and don't have a good job and refuse to do anything about it reality check good jobs don't just find you", "YTA, and it seems like you've been using your mom's illness as an excuse to be insufferable.", "YTA, your mother gave that money for a specific reason, even in with her death you don't have the authority to dictate the use of the funds.\n\nAlso your wife is correct, no job is going to magically find you.

Sorry for the loss of your mother and your wife.", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a reason your mother sent the money to your wife and not to you. You seem to have replaced your birth mother with a wife-mother. She \u201cflew you\u201d? You can\u2019t book your own flights?

Because your parent's know you are an asshole and wouldn't use it as you should. Therefore, they gave it to your wife because it was for you both, and was put in her name because she will allocate it the way it should be. \n2. You would rather divorce your wife than to get off your ass and look for a steady, good paying job. That's one of the laziest and assholish things I've read lately. \n3. You have a drinking problem but you are trying to bury it under everything else here.\n4. You accuse your wife of having a temper but give no examples of how. Let me tell you, telling you to get your ass up and work is not having a temper.", "YTA. You are using the death of your own mother to guilt money out of your wife. It is not yours.

Now you want her to share it. Regardless of whether that is the fair thing to do or not, it is not what your mother intended.", "YTA.\n\nYour mother sent a check to your wife, enough for 2 plane tickets home.\n\nWhat that tells me, is that your own mother didn't trust you with money, and wanted to see the both of you before she died.\n\nYou used your ticket.  The other half of the check was for your wife.  It certainly wasn't intended for \"your half of the mortgage.\"", "YTA, and your wife should divorce you.

If it is, the wife deserves better.", "YTA this whole thing is absolutely disgusting.  Ugh.  I could not imagine living with a drunken, selfish, lazy, bratty, childish AH like you. I hope your wife leaves you and gets therapy.", "YTA. I can tell from your writing that you're minimizing your faults that the wife is upset about. You shutting down is an excuse to not work or confront the issues. Not stepping up and getting a better job sounds like avoidance of responsibility.  \n\nEverything about this post reaks of how the world should revolve around your feelings and needs. The only redeeming thing you did was offer your wife a divorce.  I hope she takes your offer and moves on.", "YTA\n\nYou don't like your wife. You're petty. You obviously have an issue with alcohol and are trying to avoid discussing it in your comments.

The fact that you want her to give it to you so you can buy shit for yourself only proves that she was right not to trust you in the first place. Your wife isn't stressing your mom out your actions are, your mom is going to die knowing that your an alcoholic and a mooch and probably knows your wife is too good for you and should leave. Your only married now cause your wife loves your family once your mom passes her ties to you will be over along with your marriage. YTA. Own your demons, get sober or at least accept that you're a shit husband and let her move on.", "It sounds like you know YTA, but have too much pride to admit it and would rather hit rock bottom.

I can't imagine having to have one of their future spouses call me with a 'You have to take him back; I'm done waiting for him to grow up' call. That's what it sounds like: you don't want to work (but are capable), someone else should foot the bill for you to 'be happy' and if someone else has a problem with your drinking then that's their problem.\n\nYou have a lot to potentially lose. I'm sorry for your loss already (your mom), but you have opportunity to mitigate further loss of someone else who probably very deeply loves you while simultaneously losing hope.", "YTA and a drunk by the sound of it.", "Sounds like YTA, I think there is a lot missing from this story, but your mother gave your wife a gift , she can use that how she sees fit!", "This guy is a big AH .

Big difference.", "Oh come on dude. YTA. You know it.", "She wasn't mean to your mom. She was complaining about *you* to her. Also it's not up to you if she *deserves* a gift that YOU did not give her. It was your mom's money and she made the decision on how it was to be used. You're a broke boy and couldn't pull your half of the mortgage together and guilted your soon to be ex into using her gift to cover you. So yeah. You are still the AH", "Mean?  She called your mother out of frustration with YOU, and apologized for bothering her with it.  \nI'm thinking I see where the problem lies in this relationship...", "Why do you think she was mean? Your mother was terminally sick for five years - in that time was your wife just never supposed to open up to your mother about your terrible marriage?

YOU are causing the drama.", "If telling the truth about your behaviour would \"cause drama\", then it's your behaviour that's the problem. How do you not see that?", "Because your mom gave it to her for a purpose that isn\u2019t available any more so the polite thing to do would be to return the money, ask your dad (I am assuming they were still married, if they\u2019re not then whoever is set to inherit your mother\u2019s assets) what they want to do with it because they would be the ones making decisions on her assets and planning a funeral\nOr whatever else. If you don\u2019t agree with returning it then the next observation is she gave the money to your wife.

YOU\u2019RE DYING MOTHER DIDN\u2019T EVEN WANT TO SEND YOU MONEY BC YOU COULDN\u2019T BE TRUSTED WITH IT. if you can\u2019t get over your self righteousness for your wife, at least think about your mother. she couldn\u2019t even trust you with money to fly home for the holidays.", "Why do you think it would cause drama with your dad to be told the truth?", "\u2026thats what happened", "Oh causing drama is telling the truth about your toddler tantrum?", "Right? Strangers at random companies don\u2019t just call you up and offer you a job or interview even. Unless OP did the bare minimum of making an application on indeed so jobs could search for him, I don\u2019t understand how a new better job just falls in his lap without him trying for it.\n\nI do feel like it\u2019s possible it\u2019s a family friend or something. Maybe they felt bad OP was doing so shitty idk but OP is def the asshole cuz even if that worked out somehow it did take a full 5 years where his wife was unhappy with his job I have to assume cuz of financial struggles.

You do realize that it also takes time to reach that point, and in most cases there are stepping stone positions that don\u2019t allow you to leapfrog right into the job of your dreams, right? You\u2019ve wasted time not building your resume and skills so that it would be much easier to land the job you actually want.", "Not likely when she's been the main financial provider but nice try.", "that\u2019s alcoholism for you unfortunately. no accountability, it\u2019s everyone else\u2019s fault he\u2019s having a hard time. i feel bad that his wife has stuck by him through it all and he still treats her like shit", "I talked to my mom every day.", "I would guess that his dad still wants them to visit. So instead of using the money to pay for those tickets as intended he wants to use it to pay for his half of the mortgage and the wife to pay for herself.
