Since I'm single, I live with my parents, though I'm the one who pays the rent and utilities as my dad is retired. I have one sibling, who moved to another country a few years ago and has no financial obligations towards us. About a year ago, my parents and I moved into a better apartment with enough space for a guest bedroom, and soon after the move, my mom's younger sister (58/F) came over to live with us.   \n\n\nAt the time, she was going through her fifth divorce and was really upset, so I tried my best to accommodate her. However, I soon realized how toxic she is. She picks up fights with my father for no apparent reason, tries to turn my mother against my sibling, and has even had the gall to try and badmouth my father in front of me. I tried being nice to her and telling her to stop making things difficult, offered to pay for her therapy and even offered to pay the deposit on her rental so she could move out - and it backfired, big time.  \n\n\nAt the start of May 2023, we started looking for an apartment where my aunt could move and we soon found a nice unit. I deposited the required deposit amount directly into my aunt's account, as she had asked me to. However, just before the agreement had to be signed, the deal fell through. We started looking for another place, but couldn't find one that fit my budget. \n\nIn mid-August, I finally came across a small apartment at a decent distance from my place, but when I mentioned it to my aunt, she told me she can't afford to move. Upon inquiring why, she told me she had spent the money I had given her for the deposit. Mind you, during this period, she made our lives a living hell. She would yell at my father, throw things in fits of anger, would suddenly stop talking to us, and even picked up fight with our neighbors because their baby kept crying. \n\nNow, when I brought up the money issue, it resulted in a huge fight. Ultimately, my mom came to me and asked if my aunt could move into the guest bedroom permanently. I told her no. I work two jobs and have a hectic schedule, I can't come home to fights and drama every other day. I also told my mom that I want the deposit money back. Somehow, instead of siding with me, she began siding with her sister and told me I'm being selfish and petty. \n\nMy dad is an introvert who prefers to stay in his room the entire day instead of facing the problem, which means he won't take a stand either, even though he has mentioned, more than once, that he doesn't feel comfortable around my aunt.  \n\n\nYesterday, I told my aunt and my mom that I will pay the deposit directly to the new landlord and will help with the move this weekend. My aunt started yelling at me and went inside her room, my mom has opted to give me silent treatment, which is something she has never done before. I'm still going to go through with my plan, even if it'll set me back for a while, but tell me, AITA in this situation?

And then move out into your own apartment, preferably one without a guest room So they can't guilt you into coming to stay with them temporarily until they get sorted out. \n\nTrust me, this is the way to do it. I know because this is what I had to do. We went from me staying at my parents apartment for 2 months until I could get myself situated, and save up deposits to get my own apartment to suddenly paying All the bills for the overpriced apartment that my parents had chosen but we're no longer paying for. I finally got a job in a different area and moved into a two bedroom apartment and they followed me and moved into my guest room, supposedly temporarily. For the next two years I had absolutely no say what happened in my home. I paid all the bills but I wasn't allowed to watch TV because my dad was watching it. Anytime I did anything in the kitchen it was wrong because my mom knows how to cook better than I do apparently. I didn't clean well enough and apparently I was really selfish in taking the larger bedroom when it was just me and there were two of them despite the fact that this is my apartment and they will only staying with me temporarily. I had to give up 3/4 of my closet space to my mother because she would just come in and move my stuff and put hers in because her closet wasn't big enough. It went on and on and on, and even down to the day that we were supposed to be moving out of the apartment, my parents were trying to convince me to let them continue staying there with the lease under my name while I moved off into my own one bedroom place. Absolutely no way. Because I knew that rent would never be paid and my credit would be fucked. \n\nSo if the lease is in your name in the apartment you're currently living in then please make arrangements to have them moved out or evicted or whatever and speak to your landlord about it. Don't just assume that they'll do the right thing. If the lease is in their name, oh well not your problem anymore. These are adults, and it's wonderful that you tried to help them.

You Mother is siding with her because she doesn't want her sister homeless? Her sister is homeless because she chased away her 5TH husband. Apparently you Aunt doesn't work either. WTF dude. I'm not sure where you live but you don't have to take care of any of them. Your MOTHER is being selfish expecting YOU to pay for everything to take care of her and you Father. Your FATHER is being selfish expecting you to give up your entire future to take care of him and your Mother. Your Aunt is being selfish because she doesn't want to give up her free ride and patsy of a Niece. Your sibling is being selfish by not caring how your family is taking advantage of you. Does it ever occur to you they moved so far away to get away from exactly what you are doing to yourself right now? YOU are the only one not being selfish is this scenario. ALL the people could live over another 20 years and you won't have anything in your life to show for it. Don't you want for yourself: a partner? kids? even date and bring the date home to YOUR place? How about retire? You will NEVER get any of these things if you continue on this path. All 4 of them are taking advantage of you. MOVE OUT! Your parents can find somewhere in their budget, same with your Aunt. You have the right to a life outside of them.", "NTA.", "\u201cI\u2019m a person who totally ruined my own life to support ne\u2019er-do-well relatives. Am I the ass?\u201d NTA except to yourself. Do you really need a rando Redditor to tell you this?", "NTA but you move out and let your parents and aunt look after themselves (maybe take your father with you), then they'll realize they've bit the hand that fed them.", "NTA cancel the lease and move out. They\u2019ll understand the messed up when they\u2019re homeless.", "NTA \nThere's an obvious reason your aunt is going through her fifth divorce. In my country we have a saying that roughly translates to \"if you make the same mistake twice you are an unwise person\". You are not required to fix your aunt's problems, you have already done too much to help. Maybe take a leaf out of your sibling's book and gtfo", "This is the solution.  You get your own place.  Your mom and her sister find a way to pay rent.  All you have to worry about is the lease and how to get out of it.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nOh OP, for the love of goodness, kick them all out!\n\nTHEY can go live with your aunt", "Nope, NTA. Instead of using the money to move your \"Aunt\" (term used loosely because of her described behavior), use the money to move yourself out. If that's not possible because, for example, your name's the only one on the lease, then evict them all.", "NTA. And quite frankly, move out with your dad and let your mom and her sister live together. They sounds awful.", "Go live on your own, block them, and let them sort it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, YTA to yourself for being such a doormat. :(", "Sounds like you are the only adult in the family and are in the position of raising your parents.\n\nI think you need to think about your long term future. Your sibling had the right idea in shedding this responsibility. Your parents need to look after themselves. Who is going to look after you in your old age? \n\nNTA for the question you ask.", "NTA you're way too nice. Take care of yourself. Let them care for themselves.", "Somebody said, \"That which you permit, you promote.\" \n\nStop doing things for ingrates.\n\nNTA, by the way, but save yourself.", "Omg someone who has gone five divorces is an asshole? Color me surprised. Honestly, I would suggest you move in to the apartment and leave your family to your aunt.", "Asshole? No, sane. My toxic aunt milked my mother for 200K US before finally dying. And I still feel guilt over my relief that she is dead. Get that toxic human out of your home or give notice to your landlord and move yourself and Dad if he wants to come to a new place and the other two to the sidewalk.", "NTA there's no reason for you to pay anything.  I would have put her stuff outside the door and told her to figure it out.", "Nta. \n\nEveryone but dad has gotta go.\n\nMom and aunt can go be petty elsewhere on someone else's dime.", "\"Mom, I have floated you and dad's lifestyle. Your sister is someone who thrives on making other people's lives hard - and I don't need any more complications since I am working two jobs to support YOU. Count your blessings that I put up with your sister's nonsense this long already. If you don't like it, you're free to move in with her, because I won't tolerate being treated like a ATM any further. Either show me the due respect I deserve for supporting you, or piss off.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA I don't know where you live and what the norms are for extended family, but I can't imagine any culture in which this toxic behavior is OK. You have dome more than enough.", "NTA.. If your mom is so adamant to live with her sister, then tell her to move out with her, and let her pay for everything and see how fast she changes her mind.  Do not give into your aunt living with you.", "Nta. Pay the deposit, and move into that apartment yourself. Feel free to take dad with you if you want.", "Your house your rules.", "NTA.\n\nKick that harridan out yesterday.", "NTA.\n\nIf your parents insist on your toxic aunt living with them, it's time for you to move out and get your own place. Your mom giving you the silent treatment, after you've been paying for the roof over their heads, is beyond the pale.", "Move. Out. Stop paying bills for assholes that treat you like this.", "Maybe you should move to live near your sibling with very little waning. Go low contact and leave them to fend for themselves, check back in a couple years later and see how all the dominos landed after the dust has settled lol", "NTA. Move out on your own. Do not pay anyone's expenses but yours. You'll feel so much more alive once you shed these leeches.", "NTA", "Maybe you should leave them in the current place and move out on your own.  Tell your mom you are anything but selfish, you are supporting everyone in the place. If mom does not like the treatment of her sister, she can go too and they can pay their own way.  Pretty entitled bunch they are! You need to stop being the family ATM. It\u2019s obvious, your mother does not appreciate your efforts.  They are all mooching off of you", "NTA. \nFind yourself a nice place.  Move there yourself. Let them find their own way. They are grown ups they have lots of experience, and I bet Dad's retirement fund has enough money", "It might be time for you to move out, and be done with their drama.

Maybe its time to stop supporting your family who treat you like trash, find yourself a nice apartment and live in peace.\n\nAll the best!", "So now you're gonna be on the hook for two places? You should just move out yourself, and maybe invite your dad. If your mom wants to defend this behavior, fine. Never give either of them cash.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Evict your aunt and mom and your life will be better", "NTA\n\nAnd seriously, you are overstretching yourself. This sounds like a very toxic and abusive situation where your Mom and her sister have been taking advantage.\n\nWhy are you financially supporting your entire family solo? You should be able to live your own life.", "You\u2019re NTA and I understand they are family but you should do like your sibling and run to another country. This a very unhealthy situation for you to be in.", "Be like your sibling.  Move far away on your own.", "Move out on your own.", "NTA kick your aunt out now followed by your mum. Let your dad stay as it sounds like he needs a break from this drama", "Nope, NTA. You helped your Aunt out and she is abusing your hospitality and generosity. It is unfortunate that your mother cannot see that.   \n\n\nYou are going above and beyond what you should do. Paying not one but two security deposits for your Aunt, finding her an apartment, offering to help her move, etc. I hope that you realize that your aunt spent the first deposit money so that she would not be able to move. She is passive-aggressively doing things to get her way. She is toxic.", "OP should follow her sibling's lead. Move to another country.

OP, I'd be sitting down with your parents and tell them that **you'll** move and get your own place. The THREE adults there can pay the bills. (Don't leave it in your name.) I honestly can't believe your mom wants to take more and more from you.\n\nWork one job. Get your own place. Let these people take care of themselves.", "Move into the apartment yourself and leave your parents and toxic aunt to live by themselves.

Drop the cultural obligations because they're toxic", "> I wish you\u2019d get your own place and let them support themselves and aunt or the other sibling take a turn. \n\nThis is the way.", "NTA   Yes, this.", "I was thinking aunt sounds so toxic that husbands all probably left her not the other way round.", "This. Exactly. \n\nOP tell your mom that either you pay the deposit and aunt moves by X date and mom stops treating you this way or YOU will move into your own apartment and will leave mom, dad and aunt to figure out how to pay all their bills because you are done putting up with (and paying for) aunt and your moms ridiculous behaviour.", "This is the move, right here. Clean break. Let them figure it out. They're all adults.", "I'd be serving an eviction notice to dear auntie, and telling mommy dearest that she's next if she doesn't get an attitude adjustment.", "Why have to search? There is a perfectly good apartment waiting for her or her aunt.", "Agreed. Op is setting herself on fire to keep them warm. They don't deserve it.", "58 is not that old.", "No shit. That's one toxic culture.", "Perfect", "She's being treated poorly in any context TBH. There are tons... millions of people living in places where the child supports their parents more then they do in Western society, and the parents respect them for it. She is being shown no respect whatsoever.", "> If I was OP, I'd pay that deposit and move in there myself. Aunt, mom and dad can live together and support themselves. OP is definitely NTA\n\nOP - Read this!  Reeeaaad this!!  \u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f  And then read it again!  You are the only person in this scenario who isn't exuding toxicity.  Get yourself a small apartment and support yourself.  Maybe get a bit of therapy to help dig up any guilt you may be carrying around while you're still not seeing how very used and abused you are by the rest of your family.", "I came here to comment exactly that. Tell parents and aunt they have two options. Either aunt moves into the apartment and stands on her own feet, or OP takes the apartment and they all do.", "THIS is what I just said. OP needs to stop being these people's money cow.", "This is a great idea! Move and let them all support each other. Go live your own life, never look back.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m not going to pay your bills and tolerate being your punching bag. Talk about ungrateful.", "Honestly, I think this is the answer - taking dad with her of course", "I wish I could upvote this more.", "Ding ding ding!!!  \n\nAnd we have a winner!", "This is the way OP. And get your name and financial payments off your family home. NTA", "Get your name off of the current lease and move on with your life.  So far they treat you like a doormat", "I hope he's reading these comments. Cultural or not, he's being taken advantage of by three adults.", "Shitty family members pop up in every culture.", "Then they\u2019ll both just assume he\u2019ll be paying their housing costs there, too.", "Tell them they have two options, Aunt leaves and changes are made at home or OP and her money does.

His spineless self can remain in the middle of that shit sandwich.", "Dad is apparently independently wealthy, since he's retired. He can look after himself.\n\nWho is going to look after OP in *their* old age? They should leave.", "I'm not too impressed with dad retreating to his room and leaving op to fix this.", "Can I triple-vote for this one? Ultimately the choice will be theirs, not OPs.", "Exactly this. I absolutely would not be comfortable with any of my kids supporting me on this level, let alone abusing their kindness. OP,  you are sooo NTA here. You sound amazing.  Maybe it's time to put yourself first and live your life. Good luck!", "Yes, she is being taken for granted. This ultimatum is the way to go, this abusive monster of an aunt needs to go, or she will leave and take the money tree with her\u2026 Fifth divorce - I\u2019m shocked!", "Yes!!!", "You know, you\u2019re right!", "Bet they spent all their money on that dude too.", "Amen to that.  FGM can go first, please.", "Not just FGM, AAALL GM of minors, just because one is a more accepted 'cultural norm' doesn't make it right"]}
