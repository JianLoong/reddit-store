Since I'm single, I live with my parents, though I'm the one who pays the rent and utilities as my dad is retired. I have one sibling, who moved to another country a few years ago and has no financial obligations towards us. About a year ago, my parents and I moved into a better apartment with enough space for a guest bedroom, and soon after the move, my mom's younger sister (58/F) came over to live with us.   \n\n\nAt the time, she was going through her fifth divorce and was really upset, so I tried my best to accommodate her. However, I soon realized how toxic she is. She picks up fights with my father for no apparent reason, tries to turn my mother against my sibling, and has even had the gall to try and badmouth my father in front of me. I tried being nice to her and telling her to stop making things difficult, offered to pay for her therapy and even offered to pay the deposit on her rental so she could move out - and it backfired, big time.  \n\n\nAt the start of May 2023, we started looking for an apartment where my aunt could move and we soon found a nice unit. I deposited the required deposit amount directly into my aunt's account, as she had asked me to. However, just before the agreement had to be signed, the deal fell through. We started looking for another place, but couldn't find one that fit my budget. \n\nIn mid-August, I finally came across a small apartment at a decent distance from my place, but when I mentioned it to my aunt, she told me she can't afford to move. Upon inquiring why, she told me she had spent the money I had given her for the deposit. Mind you, during this period, she made our lives a living hell. She would yell at my father, throw things in fits of anger, would suddenly stop talking to us, and even picked up fight with our neighbors because their baby kept crying. \n\nNow, when I brought up the money issue, it resulted in a huge fight. Ultimately, my mom came to me and asked if my aunt could move into the guest bedroom permanently. I told her no. I work two jobs and have a hectic schedule, I can't come home to fights and drama every other day. I also told my mom that I want the deposit money back. Somehow, instead of siding with me, she began siding with her sister and told me I'm being selfish and petty. \n\nMy dad is an introvert who prefers to stay in his room the entire day instead of facing the problem, which means he won't take a stand either, even though he has mentioned, more than once, that he doesn't feel comfortable around my aunt.  \n\n\nYesterday, I told my aunt and my mom that I will pay the deposit directly to the new landlord and will help with the move this weekend. My aunt started yelling at me and went inside her room, my mom has opted to give me silent treatment, which is something she has never done before. I'm still going to go through with my plan, even if it'll set me back for a while, but tell me, AITA in this situation?

You didn't mention whether she works, so, how will she afford to live alone and manage the expenses? That is going to fall on you. Move her out by all means, but don't rescue her after that. If she fails to pay the rent/bills, don't pay for her. If she gets evicted, don't let her come back to live with you at any cost. If your mother creates trouble, tell her she can move out and live with the aunt or you will happily move out and the three of them can live together and figure out their own expenses, maybe even start working again. This will make your mom sit back when she realizes you will not take care of them financially anymore. \n\nAlso, stop listening to your parents when you are the one taking care of them. You are 30 not 3, tell them point blank that you will only take care of your parents and no one else. Does your aunt happen to have any children? If so, why doesn't she go to them?

Yes, I understand that you are supporting your family. But they obviously aren't giving you any kind of support. What are you getting out of this situation? Because it certainly isn't love & respect.

Not to be cold-hearted, but you are a 30 year old woman working two jobs and supporting 2-3 adults and at least one misbehaving one. Are you planning on settling down and starting your own family? There aren't going to be many suitors who are enthusiastic about wanting to be someone who comes with this much baggage and works two jobs, meaning no time to spend with a potential romantic partner. You might have to choose between sacrificing your own happiness or making tough decisions. \n\nWhile a 58 year old is no spring chicken, she should be able to support herself for the next decade and figure out her own retirement. How old are your parents, and what circumstances have it led them to be financially dependent on you? Can they do more to support themselves? If they can and choose to live off you, they are knowingly robbing your future for their own momentary comfort. The most important question is, do you give your own retirement plan that is underway? Because you are starting your 30s, unless you are blessed with perfect health, this decade is when you will start finding chronic that you will need to start budgeting medical expenses for.
