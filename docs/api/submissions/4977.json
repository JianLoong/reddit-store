Your daughter was well aware that this was a likely outcome of IVF treatments, so she shouldn\u2019t be surprised. She was going to throw a fit even if you told her first, she\u2019s just using this as an excuse to punish you. She needs to grow up and stop being so self-centered.

I think she made her feelings very clear, and you made yours, and you wanted to celebrate not fight.  She's choosing the opposite and facing the consequences.  NTA\n\nEditing to say I saw your comment about her getting engaged twice and you only finding out on SM, and about her without asking, planning to move back in with you if she were pregnant, even though you already pay part of her rent and insurance.  You're an ATM/convenience to her.  NTA even more.  She doesn't care about your life or your future, only how she is inconvenienced in hypothetical situations that haven't even happened and wouldn't even happen the way she wants them to.", "NTA.

I think this is probably more about your new wife and your children not being her full siblings, only half.", "You are like my dad. My dad told all his friends, that his wife, my mother was dying, long before my mother had a chance to tell us, her children.", "You have to think of passing the news, like a wolf pack, you have your alphas, the betas and then the lower zetas.

But you are really giving her a complex now by telling everyone else about the pregnancy and letting her find out on social. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me if your daughter goes NC or LC, she already feels like she\u2019s being replaced with a shiny new family. \n\nReading between the lines of the OP also leads me to believe that the way you\u2019ve originally told your daughter about the IVF you did not come across as sympathetic to her as you think and instead of letting her talk through her feelings, you shut her down from the start.\n\nYou guys need a family therapy session stat.\n\nEdit: typos/clarity.", "NTA but i might have sent her a text to cover your bases.

Your daughter is an adult now. It\u2019s ok for her to feel how she feels, but it\u2019s not ok for her to have tantrums about it and stream about your very personal IVF journey on social media. Her attitude already put a damper on your dreams of having another child before you even got pregnant. Maybe you should have told her personally, but I can\u2019t fault you for not wanting to deal with the drama that you knew would be coming. Then again, the drama would have come no matter what.

She\u2019s an adult and this is her problem. She has no say over your reproductive choices and she is not entitled to personal engagement if she cannot act respectfully.

And you don\u2019t have to subject yourself to that.\n\nOften on this sub people encourage children to go NC with their abusive parents. Parents can also go NC or LC with their abusive children.

It\u2019s pretty normal for 8 year olds to be concerned about having a sibling all of a sudden, but a 22 year old is not even going to be living in the same house, it won\u2019t change her actual lifestyle at all- she won\u2019t have to babysit, give up soccer practise, or share a bedroom. \nHer over the top reaction to the IVF news and crocodile tears about how the money wasn\u2019t spent on her potential future plans of college is really weird, unless you sat her down and said that you\u2019ve used her college fund for it. Lots of people have college funds for their kids and still manage to save money for other things too, it doesn\u2019t have to be one or the other- and again your finances are none of her concern. \nYou knew how she would react, and she indeed reacted that way- except that she was not able to react first and in her mind possibly lost the opportunity to get out ahead of the news and gather sympathy. Instead, by the time she found out everyone was happy and excited for you, (as they would have been anyway but she may have thought they would not be). \nNormally I would say that she absolutely should be mad that she wasn\u2019t told with the first circle of people- however reading your comments it appears that she herself posts news to fb (her two engagements) before telling you so basically you acted just like her, and she didn\u2019t like it.

However, it is cruel that you blatantly avoided telling her in person.\n\nThe question you need to ask yourself is why is she acting like this? Have either of you sat down, calmly, and discussed why she didn\u2019t want a sibling? Is there perhaps bad blood between your new wife and your daughter? Does she feel neglected emotionally or physically?\n\nAlso, one part of your post that caught me was one of her reasons being age difference. If that\u2019s the case, I feel her.

It would\u2019ve quelled her age difference argument, and many teens bounce around foster care. IVF is expensive, if you have money for fertility treatments, then why not adopt or foster?\n\nIf you didn\u2019t wish to adopt, then you must want bio kids with your new wife.

Her father, the only parent she has left, is making a new family with another woman.

Seems like she didn\u2019t have the greatest of parents", "But but but - poor 22 year old!!! \ud83e\udd23", "%100 - it\u2019s disturbing the gross entitlement that is posted here.", "Well guess he gets what he wants then", "Bless your small brain. I actually didn\u2019t say he can\u2019t have more children \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">just certain things he doesn\u2019t have control over, which would help the situation\n\nBut one thing he does have control over he does poorly. He chooses to avoid her completely because he knew the conversation would be hard for him.", "You aren\u2019t. The entitled asshat brigade like to conveniently dis regard all of the horrible  behavior you and your wife have endured/ it\u2019s like a craft for them at this point.", "You\u2019re ditching her for you new baby. Honestly, you\u2019re a shitty father to your daughter and you\u2019ll do the same to the 2nd when they get older. Especially if your now wife and you get divorced. You r made her feel this way somehow. How does your current wife treat your daughter??? I\u2019m betting not very good", "Yeah but you seem angry with her and seem to be mad at your daughter because of it. Maybe because your daughter was raised by a violent drunk she looks to you to be there for her all the time? She isn't like this because of her mom you also have responsibility into how she behaves.", "She is owed nothing. No one is- that is the problem with all of the comments here shamming a man", "Unless your willing to take their abuse for years?  Is that what you mean??", "That conversation has happened many many times through this. \n\nShe has been to a psychiatrist, and they have come back with depression. \n\nSince she hit 18 she refuses to go, and I have gotten her 4 different therepists, and she will go a few times and then stop. \n\nI do understand that she has struggles due to her overall upbringing, but I can't force her to do anything, and she is an adult, and at some point she has to do it for herself.", "Mostly with me, and then later my wife. We moved in with my wife together as I had full custody. \n\nEven when her mom didn't have visitation we allowed her into our home so long as she was sober, any time she wanted to visit, and she did visit fairly often. \n\nI did spoil her and probably was over compensating. \n\nI was the parent with the rules, her mom was the fun parent. When she got older she would get mad and go live with her mom, then want to come home a few weeks later.", "Bless my small brain??? Lol says the entitled kid who thinks their parents owe them respect after being complete asshats for the better part of 10 years. Have fun with that! \ud83e\udd23", "People have multiple kids all the time without \u201creplacing\u201d the older kids. This take is shortsighted.", "That\u2019s just ridiculous lol", "The daughter is 22, not 12.  She is a grown ass adult on her own with her own life."]}
