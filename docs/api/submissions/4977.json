Your daughter was well aware that this was a likely outcome of IVF treatments, so she shouldn\u2019t be surprised. She was going to throw a fit even if you told her first, she\u2019s just using this as an excuse to punish you. She needs to grow up and stop being so self-centered.

But you are really giving her a complex now by telling everyone else about the pregnancy and letting her find out on social. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me if your daughter goes NC or LC, she already feels like she\u2019s being replaced with a shiny new family. \n\nReading between the lines of the OP also leads me to believe that the way you\u2019ve originally told your daughter about the IVF you did not come across as sympathetic to her as you think and instead of letting her talk through her feelings, you shut her down from the start.\n\nYou guys need a family therapy session stat.\n\nEdit: typos/clarity.", "NTA but i might have sent her a text to cover your bases.

Your daughter is an adult now. It\u2019s ok for her to feel how she feels, but it\u2019s not ok for her to have tantrums about it and stream about your very personal IVF journey on social media. Her attitude already put a damper on your dreams of having another child before you even got pregnant. Maybe you should have told her personally, but I can\u2019t fault you for not wanting to deal with the drama that you knew would be coming. Then again, the drama would have come no matter what.

She\u2019s an adult and this is her problem. She has no say over your reproductive choices and she is not entitled to personal engagement if she cannot act respectfully.

If she had been 18 or younger, I would have immediately pegged this as a YTA\n\nIf she had been 5 or younger her behavior would be an understandable temper tantrum. \n\nBut there is no age where a child is allowed to dictate whether or not their parents are allowed to have more kids. \n\nA 12-18 year old telling their dad he can\u2019t have more kids is an AH. Younger than that is the same, but because of their age would be called a \u201clittle shit\u201d instead.", "Additionally, worried about money going towards college when she\u2019s not even going. Entitled much?", "Does she even have kids? Doesn't seem like it. He said \"her future kids.\" She is mad that dad is \"taking time\" from kids that DON'T EVEN EXIST.  \n\n\nI would not tell this girl a goddamn thing about my life. NTA.", "It would be a nice break.", "She was born to OP and original mom when OP was only like 19. It isn't a stretch to believe she went without at many points in her life, so I understand how this \"re-do\" baby leads to some resentment, especially if some promises were made at some point.", "You should also add that you've tried to get her into therapy and this behavior isn't new.", "He was also extremely vague about her worrying about college. I wonder if she was promised helped with tuition and the money went towards ivf instead. I'd be pissed if funds that were promised to help my future were spent creating a new child/family.", "She is ONE BIG BRAT!  Can\u2019t answer my question huh?", "From reading your comments it doesn\u2019t sound like you like your daughter very much. You seem bitter towards the relationship. Maybe it\u2019s justified and she\u2019s a brat or maybe there\u2019s more to the story that we don\u2019t know. \n\nEither way, I think if you want a relationship with her you should consider family counseling with just the two of you. It might help to have a third party to mediate between the both of you. Otherwise it may be better to cut off the relationship because nothing productive is happening here.", "If you go through his comments, you\u2019ll see that she sounds like an entitled brat.\n\nShe\u2019s left home repeatedly for not getting her way, only to come back a few weeks later.  (Including moving in with a 40 year old).\n\nShe\u2019s posted on fb she\u2019s engaged a few times without telling her dad. \n\nShe was living steaming and complaining about their IVF.\n\nTo me she seemed entitled AF.\nThis guy has done everything he can for his kid\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m guessing the daughter\u2019s feelings over the baby are not coming out of nowhere.

One collage class lol", ">The money isn\u2019t owed to you\n\nI am so fucking sick of everyone on Reddit acting like parents who have the ability to put their child through college but chose not to aren't absolute assholes. That is honestly such a shitty thing and obviously not every family has the means to financially support their children through college, but if you can and choose not to, you're an asshole.", "I even have to ask does she even have her own kids?!? If there\u2019s no grandkids his daughter is way out of line and selfish as heck!

I think it\u2019s very normal for a child that young to experience feelings of jealousy, and even abandonment, at the thought of even bio-parents having more kids. I\u2019m not defending her, but even at her age, I can imagine that in her mind, it\u2019s like he\u2019s starting an entirely new family, maybe even the family he wanted all along, and she\u2019s not a part of it. That\u2019s something they need to sit down and discuss together like the adults they are.", "Oh it just clicked that she probably didn't want her inheritence to be split with the new baby", "Ikr?  He\u2019s probably had enough of the drama and is just over it.", "If you read his post and his comments, you\u2019ll see she has been involved since before the IVF treatments. Her behavior is what led to her being excluded.", "He edited his post to add she\u2019s never taken a class. \nIf she had, they may not have had the month for IVF. Unless they\u2019ve been doing it for more then 3 years?", "He has stated he tried that several times he hs and she quit after a few sessions, probably cuz the therapist told her stuff she didn\u2019t want to hear etc.", "Welcome to Reddit. That\u2019s the point - to comment. Catch up.", "How is me saying \u201cif he wants to cut her off then fine, this would be an acceptable thing to do\u201d not getting that a parent might not want a relationship with their child?", "I loved it! I have a brother who\u2019s only 16 months older than me and we have a good relationship too, it\u2019s just 100% different than the relationship with my older bros. Older bros are more uncle types and my other bro is like a best friend. I\u2019m definitely grateful I got to experience both types of siblins", "Seriously, you easily could've responded with a ton of snark because it was easy to imagine that I was accusing you of making something up and you were clearly in the right and explained it. You could've just said read the comments or anything less patient sounding than your response so I appreciate you!  It's some sort of reddit christmas miracle.", "Okay but when you tell the mistake child that you're going to have a do over baby and this one is going to have the good childhood they never did because you already had a practice run and made all the mistakes on them, the mistake baby, you can maybe see why that would cause some hurt feelings and upset reactions???", "But try explaining that to the child who was conceived because of it. \n\nMy parents are also divorced and throughout my childhood I often sometimes hear how they stayed together longer for my sake. I started eating pencil lead hoping it would kill me so I can fix things for them at 8. \n\nAt 30 I was talking with my mom about time travel once and we started talking about what we do if we could go back in time.\n\nShe said at first she didn\u2019t want to marry my dad again. But then she changed her mind cause she still wanted me. So she said she would marry my dad, have me then take me with her. I didn\u2019t really hear what she wanted for the rest of her life. I just know as a 30 year old I still breathed a sigh of relief that she wanted my existence and didn\u2019t blame me for ruining her life. \n\nMy dad did have another child, and I\u2019ve just learned to accept that he is much more ready to be a dad now. I actually tactfully stay away when he is with his wife and kid and around other ppl. Especially when I see him acting like a younger man who is a new parent. I am happy for him, but doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not hurting me.", "Six year olds can be jealous. They don\u2019t use the word jealous but they can most certainly act jealous.

He is 41 and his wife is 35 and clearly desperately wants children but isn\u2019t allowed to because of his adult daughter being jealous? Not everyone\u2019s pipes work well and if they have the means to do IVF for kids, that is their choice. And who is to say the wife isn\u2019t paying for part of it? He was still a teenager when his daughter was born and odds are it was accidental at that age.

Until the money is used for college, its not hers", "Paying for your child\u2019s college is a nice thing to do. But how long is it still considered as a parent paying for their child\u2019s college before its just an adult putting another adult through school.

Where is the line between parents taking care of their children and children just not wanting to pay their own school expenses?", "When the kids, as adults, act like that they are owed nothing.  You get what you give, half the AITA posts are about people feeling entitled to money that isn't theirs.  Let me guess, your parents didn't pay for your college?", "Bro the problem is the system not parents wanting to dump thousands more dollars on a potentially-useless degree.
