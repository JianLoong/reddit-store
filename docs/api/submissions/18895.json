He's taking advantage of you.\n\n>He likes to eat in fancy places and everytime we go to a breakfast or lunch place he orders whatever he wants and I just get coffee.\n\nHe only likes to eat in fancy places because you're paying for him.", "You should\u2019ve stopped him the first time. Why did you pay?", "NTA - you should only pay for what you ate.", "Lol, NTA. Dude knows you\u2019re just getting coffee, he\u2019s trying to get his trip subsidized by you.", "NTA - You play for what you order and half the tax and tip.  From now on tell the server you'll be needing two checks, then there is no argument.  Just because you have enough money doesn't mean you need to spend it on him, and he's not being a good friend by assuming you'd be okay with this.\n\nAlso, please talk to your doctor or a certified nutritionist before starting a new diet.  Only eating once a day and drinking lots of coffee isn't healthy.", "NTA. Next time don't get the coffee when he's with you; pick it up elsewhere. He doesn't sound very nice. No wonder he needs a fancy breakfast every day\u2014when it's half price, it tastes better!", "NTA for not wanting to split it like that.  Makes no sense.", "NTA it\u2019s ok to set the boundary that you want separate checks when you eat out. If he\u2019s unable to respect that then this may not be a friendship worth your time", "NTA\n\nAsk the restaurants to split the bill when you first arrive.", "NTA. This is something that needs to talked about and agreed on before hand. I presume by your post that you didn't agree to this.", "I pay for what I ordered. That's it.", "...NTA, I would be pissed and I would have ended the entire friendship then and there, and made the \"friend\" pay for their own shit from the beginning.   \n\n\nYOU are making a 6 figure salary. That doesn't mean HE gets to have a cut of it.   \nIf you wanna get back at him, next time order something insanely expensive and then split the bill and tell him he's just being petty for keeping tabs on small things.", "This guy tries to get you to pay for half his food, then calls you names when you don't want to.\n\nListen, he's the \"petty\" one. And it isn't \"small things\" if he's trying to cheat you.\n\nTell him so when you break up with him.\n\nNTA.", "Do this: as soon as a wait person shows up to take your order, ask \"Is is possible for us to get separate checks?\"  *(for 2 people, I've never had anyone say \"No*.\")\n\nCheap people do what your friend is doing b/c it costs them HALF-or less-than what they actually owe.\n\nIt's not you being cheap or petty...it's him being cheap and manipulative, TBH.", "NTA. My friends tried to do the same thing. Pay for what you ordered. It was unfair if you only ordered one thing", "NTA I don't mind paying for friends someone's but I'm not going to split the bill and still pay part of theirs . And just assuming someone is going to pay for your stuff makes your friend sucks", "NTA\n\nYou should both just pay your own orders. Doing it this way you're paying way more and sharing the bill is something that needs to be agreed before.", "Nta- say I will pay for what I had. Please diet carefully though, your body needs more than coffee", "NTA, you want fancy, YOU pay for fancy.", "NTA. Yeah no. Don\u2019t pay for his food. Pay for your coffee and that\u2019s it.", "NTA he\u2019s trying to mooch off you. It\u2019s perhaps fine if it\u2019s small amounts like $1 but a whole $30 split in half is really taking the piss. The audacity of him to call you petty. Please don\u2019t ever travel with him anymore", "Info, are you staying at a friend's house for free or both paying market rate for lodging? Trying to figure out if there is some value you out are getting and the food is just a way to pay some of that back.", "NTA", "NTA. He\u2019s the petty one.

How? \n\nYTA for doing this and whining about it on social media later.\n\nJUST SAY NO.", "Edit to NTA\n\n\nDid you tell him you were on this diet before the trip? Because honestly, being like \"well I only do one meal and you can do whatever\" is also kind of shitty. Having the other person sitting there with simply a coffee because they are on a diet and feeling like a bother.", "INFO: Did he then proceed to pay for his purchases and not give you any grief about it and move on from there?   \n\n\nIf so, then it's a N A H -- because he's just sharing an opinion and not such an outrageous one as to be ridiculous. Oh I think he's wrong, dont get me wrong, but $100,000 a year can afford to not worry about the $10-20 purchase here or there and who owes who a couple bucks. Its a believable position for him to hold and to say \"worrying about a little petty cash\"\n\nBut he doesn't get to tell you what you are allowed to be worried or not worried about. And nobody gets to unilaterally dictate how \"group purchases\" are made. So when you stated how you wanted bills being split if he argued against it or disrespected that in any way then it's **NTA.**", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
