All diets are not meant for everyone. There are so many diets out there for different people/different reasons. But this one you currently are doing doesn't sound like it's providing you any nutritional value. The most part of your diet is coffee, with just one meal a day. \n\nSurviving on one meal a day is bad enough by itself and will screw up your system, plus you're drinking loads of coffee. You can't \"survive\" on caffeine, that's not what our bodies are meant to do. It's not an alternative to your other two meals, if it were a good alternative everyone would be doing it. This \"diet\" can lead to acidity issues, gas, and you might develop other stomach problems like ulcers. It can even ruin your bowel movements or create other problems in the long run. Not trying to be rude, just a little alarmed though. This doesn't sound like a normal way of eating. Please be careful and take care of your health :)", "Learn the phrase.....
