Why did you pay?", "NTA - you should only pay for what you ate.", "Lol, NTA. Dude knows you\u2019re just getting coffee, he\u2019s trying to get his trip subsidized by you.", "NTA - You play for what you order and half the tax and tip.  From now on tell the server you'll be needing two checks, then there is no argument.  Just because you have enough money doesn't mean you need to spend it on him, and he's not being a good friend by assuming you'd be okay with this.\n\nAlso, please talk to your doctor or a certified nutritionist before starting a new diet.  Only eating once a day and drinking lots of coffee isn't healthy.", "NTA. Next time don't get the coffee when he's with you; pick it up elsewhere. He doesn't sound very nice. No wonder he needs a fancy breakfast every day\u2014when it's half price, it tastes better!", "NTA for not wanting to split it like that.  Makes no sense.", "NTA it\u2019s ok to set the boundary that you want separate checks when you eat out. If he\u2019s unable to respect that then this may not be a friendship worth your time", "NTA\n\nAsk the restaurants to split the bill when you first arrive.", "NTA. This is something that needs to talked about and agreed on before hand. I presume by your post that you didn't agree to this.", "I pay for what I ordered. That's it.", "...NTA, I would be pissed and I would have ended the entire friendship then and there, and made the \"friend\" pay for their own shit from the beginning.   \n\n\nYOU are making a 6 figure salary.

My friends tried to do the same thing. Pay for what you ordered. It was unfair if you only ordered one thing", "NTA I don't mind paying for friends someone's but I'm not going to split the bill and still pay part of theirs .

The audacity of him to call you petty. Please don\u2019t ever travel with him anymore", "Info, are you staying at a friend's house for free or both paying market rate for lodging?

How? \n\nYTA for doing this and whining about it on social media later.\n\nJUST SAY NO.", "Edit to NTA\n\n\nDid you tell him you were on this diet before the trip? Because honestly, being like \"well I only do one meal and you can do whatever\" is also kind of shitty. Having the other person sitting there with simply a coffee because they are on a diet and feeling like a bother.", "INFO: Did he then proceed to pay for his purchases and not give you any grief about it and move on from there?   \n\n\nIf so, then it's a N A H -- because he's just sharing an opinion and not such an outrageous one as to be ridiculous. Oh I think he's wrong, dont get me wrong, but $100,000 a year can afford to not worry about the $10-20 purchase here or there and who owes who a couple bucks. Its a believable position for him to hold and to say \"worrying about a little petty cash\"\n\nBut he doesn't get to tell you what you are allowed to be worried or not worried about. And nobody gets to unilaterally dictate how \"group purchases\" are made. So when you stated how you wanted bills being split if he argued against it or disrespected that in any way then it's **NTA.**", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Pay what you spent plus a generous tip if a tip was given. Frankly, I would Venmo request him back for what I\u2019d actually fair or just let him pay a really large dinner bill and then say \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got this since I\u2019ve paid X extra for your breakfasts and lunches so far\u201d.
