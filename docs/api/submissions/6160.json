Good luck.", "YTA you are holding something against your brother that wasn\u2019t even done to you. Your brother is an individual with his own relationship with your father and his own way of dealing with his loss. Not everyone can jump into having a step parent.

He chose to address him a certain way and you had a problem with it.  He argues because you all were forcing a relationship. That is such a bs thing to do.

He is better off without you.", "Question, does he still treat your step dad like that?", "Yeah, YTA. He was a child and it was difficult to see his mother with another man.

But cutting off and punishing your brother for not doing the same is awful. He lost his dad. He didn't want a replacement. He wasn't obliged to accept a replacement.

That's just awful.", "YTA\n\nGet the fuck over it. \n\nYou\u2019re holding a grudge that even your parents and your brother seem to be over.\n\nYour brother was 13", "YTA", "YTA.

But that doesn't make it a good decision. That doesn't make it reasonable either. \n\nI'll stop short of calling you an asshole. Not so much because I don't have enough information. (You said what caused this division when he was only 13 years old, but I have no idea what happened after that. Maybe there's more to the story and it's more reasonable than it sounds.) This is not an INFO. Your adult brother is emphatically *not* an asshole for how he behaved at the age of 13 while dealing more poorly with the trauma of losing his father than you did. But you are not an asshole for not wanting to do the work of resolving your relationship with him right now. All that said, I would encourage you to rethink the decision.

YTA edit because I asked his age and I can see he posted it.", "YTA\u2026 you need to grow up. \n\nFor context, my brother and I have a similar age gap (I\u2019m 29 and he\u2019s 25) and we really struggled with our relationship when we were younger. He was wild and disrespectful to my parents and caused them a lot of heartache, plus financial and legal trouble when he was in his late teens. He went to rehab three times between the ages of 17 and 20 and I absolutely hated the way he acted and treated our step dad in particular. Our \u201cstep\u201d dad is the only father my brother has ever known and when he was a teen he decided to pull the \u201cyou\u2019re not my real dad\u201d move, which was insanely disrespectful. I treated him like shit throughout our teens and early 20\u2019s and basically cut ties with him. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026 the way I was treating him didn\u2019t help anyone at all. It bothered my parents and only made their heartache worse. Eventually I just distanced myself emotionally and let him mature, which he did. It has now been 5 years and he\u2019s living a perfectly normal, successful life and is over at my parent\u2019s house pretty much every weekend helping them around the house. We all do holidays together. My brother and I are very very different people and will probably not be friends any time soon, but he would drop anything to help me - he\u2019s a good brother. \n\nAnyway, is there anything else that you\u2019re holding on to so tight from your teens? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re 20 and this was just a few years ago - it\u2019s been over a decade and your brother was a child. I\u2019m not sitting here at 29 being upset at anything someone did when I was 16. \n\nIt sounds like he has a relationship with your mom and step dad now, you\u2019re the one who is causing a rift at this point. I do understand how you felt at the time, but it\u2019s well past the time to move on.", "YTA\n\nWow, way to be a shitty brother.\nI think you are making it worse between your brother and stepfather.", "YTA", "Wow! YTA\n\nYou sound immature AF. You're still acting like that 16 year old that told your little brother that you were done and he was no longer your brother.\n\nYou don't get to dictate how he reacts to a new step parent. You don't get to hold a grudge because he didn't react the same way that you did.", "YTA", "YTA", "If your stepdad is past it shouldn\u2019t you be?\nYou claim to love your parents but are putting your desire to hold a grudge above their wishes and happiness.\nYTA", "The fact that you accepted a new man as your dad within a few \\*months\\* is very unusual for an older sibling especially and older one.

And you judged a 13 year old for not being ok with that...ok you were 16 but you then held that grudge for years to come.\n\nWow you really are a monumental arse.

Did you feel that your biological father favored him? Were they closer than you and your father were? \"your little family of three\" comes across as very possessive. Did you take the opportunity to push your younger brother out of the way so you could be the 'favorite' child? Are you punishing your little brother for pain your dad caused? The crime of disrespect towards your stepfather does not fit the punishment of being exiled from the family. Your easy willingness to replace your father with new step-dad suggests you had anger and bitterness towards your real dad. Taking those feelings out on your brother is wrong and undeserved.

What was the point of this, to spend Christmas alone?", "YTA - for starters, you don't get to decide when or how your brother heals from your father's death. Nor do you get to decide when or how he accepts your stepdad into his life. You are an insufferable and controlling person. You are the only one choosing to cause drama currently. Also, you're probably a huge part of the reason your brother resented your stepdad.

This seems to be a symptom and perhaps not the full issue.", "Of course my mom is upset, but I've never tried to alienate her from her other son, \n\nThat\u2019s BS you are alienating them you specifically tried to have them not have Christmas together\n\n> they talk a lot, and I'm fine with that. \n\nWho the f are you that they need your permission to talk to each other \n\n> AFAIK the whole reason he wanted to come was for my mom's sake, which is fine, just not in my house.\n\nSo now you\u2019re a hypocritical AH doing far worse than the grieving 13 ever did, you don\u2019t care about \u201cbeing a family\u201d at all", "Think long and hard about how your late father would feel about your behavior. Your brother was a very hurt, very young child, and behaved in exactly the way many traumatized children do. He needed you to help him navigate his trauma and find a healthier way of integrating with the family, but instead you rejected him outright when he was at his most hurt and vulnerable. \n\nGrow up and be better.", "OP hasn\u2019t cared about his brothers feelings since he was a boy. Yeah, that ship has probably sailed.  If I was OPs brother I would not want his toxic attitude in my life anyway.", "If the parents are so upset to the point they are refusing to go because brother was not invited, it\u2019s safe to assume that stepdad and brother built a relationship with time", "Totally. Some people don\u2019t accept a step out of loyalty to their bio parent while others don\u2019t click emotionally with someone. You can\u2019t force a bond. You shouldn\u2019t have a problem with it. Your parents clearly don\u2019t since they refused to come to Christmas without him. People are allowed to feel a certain way. You don\u2019t have to like it or agree with it but you have already allowed this to damage your relationship.", "I think OP was 11 and the brother 8.  Which is probably worse", "It is beyond sad that years later, as adults, OP still cannot be objective and look at things from his brother\u2019s perspective.", "It's great to see someone say that.", "Because OP is afraid stepfather will leave if brother is being difficult. He doesn\u2019t want to lose his new father because of the brother.", "Idk for me what got me off the nah hill is that he threated to throw a tantrum so he wouldn't have to go to the wedding.", "So it's okay for him to hurt his mother and stepfather as an adult but it wasn't okay for his brother to do the same as a pre-teen/teenager? \n\nAt least his brother had a good reason to act like he did as he was acting out of grief seeing his father being replaced by someone else.", "I don't read his behavior as toxic. He was 8-13 through the span of OP's explanation. In that time his father died, his mother started dating and remarried, and his brother seemed to move on from his dad and welcome this new guy in his place.\n\nGrief does horrible things to adults.

You may have been able to accept your mother\u2019s husband as your father but your brother did not.  I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019ve held this grudge all of these years.

YTA & are the one who has been wrong this entire time. \n\nYou fully accepted & replaced your dad with your stepdad. That's good for you. Where YOU went wrong was expecting your brother to feel the same & then being angry when he had his own feelings & didn't follow your lead for once. \n\nHe was a CHILD who lost his dad. His entire world changed & then he had the people he trusted most moving on & just expecting him to do the same. \n\nHow dare you practically demand he love & accept a man as his new dad when he didn't want to. Did you ever stop to consider your pushing didn't help things?\n\nYou've been punishing him for years for not doing what you wanted while completely forgetting that he wasn't wrong either. He was hurting & you didn't care because you got a new dad. Shame on you! I feel terrible for your brother. He lost so much & then had his big brother punish him simply because he didn't want the same things he did. You have some audacity.", "he was 13 dumbass, the fuck did you expect?", "Your stepfather sure seems to appreciate you fighting a battle that doesn't need to be fought by refusing to go to your place for the holidays.

Toxic behaviour", "YTA. It\u2019s pretty common for children and teens to have tense relationships with their step parents, especially after a parent dies - even more so if the relationship is pushed on them. When my dad died (I was 13) and my mom remarried I was never expected to call him \u201cdad.\u201d He gave me space and understood that he was not a replacement father. He respected my boundaries and knew it would take time to establish a relationship. If my mom had forced me to call him \u201cdad\u201d I would\u2019ve been pretty pissed. Losing a parent is traumatic. I\u2019m sure your brother was very upset by this. No one has the right to take that away from him, especially you.", "You realize that a lot of teenagers are like this right? Even with their biological parents. That\u2019s why you give them the space to grow up", "this is the first im seeing the elder sibling accepting the new step parent this quickly, honestly its pretty weird how he just forgot about his dad within months.", "Yes and now that same person wants to spend Christmas with your brother so seems like he is more rational about this and understands how grieving teens might behave.", "I stand by him wanting to be daddies little princess", "you sound so spoiled and exhausting", "What damage?! Your stepfather is perfectly fine and accepts the relationship he has with your brother. Honestly OP it\u2019s s all in your head.", "He mellowed? You mean he grew up, and by the looks of things, you never did. Your parents think well enough of him and love him to want him to be included on Christmas day. Without a course correction, this might be the last time you're hosting for your little family of three because your parents know you really are a family of four. Also, why would you callously abandon your  younger brother the way you did. Usually, older siblings look out for their younger siblings in a traumatic event in this instance, your father's death, and stick together through good & bad. You did the exact opposite, thinking only of your own comfort, and threw your younger brother away. And still doing the same thing now.  This just can't be real. Sad.", "Yes it is. Did it hurt that they spent the holidays with your brother and not you? Looks like it's not your family anymore.", ">He expected me to back him up ... I never really did. \n\n**Why is it you are able to make your own choice**, *independent of your brother*, over whether you wanted your stepdad in your life, but your **brother can't do the same?** \n\nWhy did he have to do it YOUR WAY, and not make his own choice? \n\nYour stepfather is NOT OWED to be treated and accepted like a dad just because he married your mother. \n\nYou made the decision to do so, and your brother decided he didn't want that. \n\nINFO: How exactly did your brother treat you stepfather, in detail? Did he just reject your stepdad's advances of acting like a dad?", "So he what you\u2019re saying is he grew up and you didn\u2019t", "You do realize you are now hurting your family, right? You are making your mother choose between her 2 sons. She should not have to do that, especially over some petty bs that happened when you were children.", "Was your age accurate? You aren't really acting it.", "its cool that you accepted hims as your father but he didnt need to do the same, you are just a petty asshole because your brother didnt do the same as you", "You're right. The damage IS done. By you. Your brother was a child that was struggling with the reality that his father was dead and he was not ready for someone else to take on that role. You are a grown ass adult that is still throwing a tantrum over your younger brother not feeling the same way as you.  \n\n\nYour parents obviously aren't okay with how you're behaving. You're hurting them with your actions and words. The only difference is that you're an adult that is hurting them and your brother was a struggling, grieving child. So, you get to hurt your parents with your actions and words as an adult but you insist on continuing to punish for brother for doing so as a child? You're a hypocrite and a bad person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrow up. YTA.", "You did the damage brother. Deep, irreparable damage. Congratulations YTA", "The damage YOU did. You are wrong, not  just a little wrong but a whole lot wrong. I would NEVER do to my brother what you've done to yours. You should be ASHAMED of yourself, ASHAMED. And ya momma she should be ashamed of herself as a parent for letting you act this and treat your brother this way. Even my own dad, whose brothers have done some fucked up shit, has not done to his brothers what you're doing to yours. Shame on you for trying to hold a GRIEVING CHILD to some arbitrary standard you took upon yourself to set. Maybe you need to stop making this about you and for just 1 minute see this grom his side.\n\n1. Dad dies when he's young child. That's a lot to process at and a lot of big feelings. I dealt with losing a close grandfather at 8 years old, I had a lot of big feelings about that, and I can't imagine how much harder it would have been to lose a parent around that age.\n2. Mom moves on three years later. Again, it's ripping open the wound. Mom dating is a stark reminder again that Dad is gone and never coming back. Plus all the feelings of how yo approach this new dude\n3. His own brother happily accepts the new guy as dad and now expects him to fall in line because [insert older brother's ridiculous standards here]. Perception: brother is acting like biodad never existed and is replaceable. He doesn't view your dad as replaceable\n4. Older brother is being a dick and holding a grudge.\n\nEven your own parents think YTA. Grow the fuck up, and let it go, Elsa.", "I N F O do you do this a lot? Replace people when they don't agree with you? You replaced your dad with the step very quickly, which I maybe can understand. You were young, looking for a father figure, and your step dad was a good guy. But you seem to have very easily pushed your brother out of your \"new family\" because he wasn't willing to accept a new father figure the way you were. And now that your brother can tolerate your step father to the point he and your mother refused to come to your place for Christmas because you can't let this go, you are fine just not having your parents or brother. How is it your stepfather was so important to you he became your dad almost immediately, but not so important you couldn't tolerate your brother for a night for his sake? Do you need a new new family now because your parents \"picked your brother over you\"?", "You are definitely reading it right. Mom's brand new BF became dad in just a few months.", "OP says he was 14 when his mother met his stepdad, making the little brother 11 when they met and 8 when his dad died.", "Golly dang. Couldn't agree more. This was a vulnerable time and the hill they chose to die on was not wanting a new dad? A step-dad that has respected that enough that they're comfortable spending the holidays with them?\n\nLike, ultimately, what is the point of this grudge? Do you think that maybe, just maybe, by not agreeing with you it somehow invalidates your own feelings and makes you seem callous for not having grief? Stop being a pill and talk to your brother! He was 13!", "OP was 11 when their dad died abd 14 when mom met stepdad so his brother was 8 and 11", "Having lost my dad at the age of 8, it was hard. My friends had no idea what was happening. I had no idea what was really happening. I was acting put at school and at home. It was not a great time. On top of that, such a young age, there\u2019s not a lot of memories either. I feel bad for OP\u2019s brother.", "Props to his parents though for not letting that stand and not showing up", "Exactly! OP still seems to be looking at this from just one perspective and completely ignoring how his brother feels.", "Especially since the kid was only 13 when he made that decision. Like wow", "The younger brother's mother's wedding. A singular parent because the kid doesn't view step-dad-to-be as a parent (and isn't technically stepdad until after marriage either). Made possessive because it's mom's wedding. So, parent's is correct.", "They had only one surviving parent at the time, so yeah, parent's wedding to the step.", "One still grieving probably and watching his brother fawn over the new dude.", "I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how nightmarish it would be to be 13 years old and you just lost your father and some new dude shows up almost immediately and your older brother starts calling him \u201cdad\u201d from the jump\u2026 it honestly gives me chills. So creepy and fucked up. The little bro\u2019s reaction is PERFECTLY justified. OP\u2019s behavior in all of this is psychotic and shameful. YTA, OP. You will never not be the asshole.", "I\u2019m not sure OP has ever moved on from age 14 mentally", "It's not that he's ignoring how his brother feels: It's that he's rejecting and punishing him for how he feels because it's an inconvenience to him.\n\nGood for the parents for basically telling him that enough is enough and he needs to grow up.\n\nOP, I could understand your reaction when you were a kid. You're 28 years old now. A grown ass adult. You should know better. You owe your brother an apology for trying to dictate how he feels and for punishing him for not feeling the same as you. How he feels is not for you to decide. It's fantastic that you adjusted well to the changes that happened after your father died but your brother obviously did not and that is NOT something that he deserves to be ostracized from the family for.\n\nYTA. Good on your parents for not showing up.", "It's not right to ignore how op's brother is feeling. He needs to be seen from his brother's point of view.", "He lost his dad at a young age and is expected to just accept a new person like nothing happened", "Can you explain your patriot-level devotion to your step-dad? Do you also start your day with a salute and a singing a hymn honoring your step-dad?", "Ok, JFC, story time. \n\nGenerally families are complicated and every member of the family has their own role to play.  Families aren\u2019t just a bunch of people living in the same house. A family is a *system* with a bunch of moving parts. Every part has a purpose and none of them are acting on their own. When we\u2019re talking about a 13-year-old with trauma and a blended family there is no such thing as that person being responsible for their relationships with the adults in that family.  Generally when there\u2019s one member of a family group who is the \u2018troublemaker\u2019, there\u2019s a reason for that beyond \u2018Billy is an asshole\u2019. It\u2019s because having someone make trouble fixes something else in the family dynamic. Maybe mom and dad fight a lot less when Billy and Dad fight, so Billy fights with Dad because it\u2019s less scary than seeing Mom and Dad fight.  Maybe Billy talks back because someone else is already the Good Kid and he feels like even if he tries he\u2019ll only be second best at being Good so he might as well stake out a different territory. I don\u2019t know!   But I do know that you did not have an objective viewpoint as a 16 year old and if you haven\u2019t had a substantive relationship with your brother since he was 13 then you have no idea who he is or how he relates to the other members of your family.", "Just because you have indiscriminate attachment doesn\u2019t mean that your brother is like you. No everyone is ready to hop on board with a step parent.", "So you lost your dad and gained another one. \n\nHe lost his dad **and then his brother.**", "But it's ok for you to treat your brother worse and you keep it up.\n\nThe saddest thing is if you hadn't been behaving like such a monstrous shit to your brother, he might have accepted him eventually. But you drove a wedge in that and then judge him for it. And all because you were so desperate to have a new dad.\n\nGo to a therapist to understand why what do did is wrong and why you as an adult should have become a better human by now.", "Oh my god - you literally made your brother\u2019s fear come true in a way. \nYou constantly kept telling him that the new member to the family is far more important than the one who use to be inseparable from you at one point. Sheesshh OP that\u2019s so so wrong.", "Did either of you get therapy after losing your dad?", "i mean, from the sounds of it, you don't have to worry about many people being in your life much longer. so upside to you being an arse is that you get what you wanted and probably more! :)", "Honestly your brother might be better off without you at this point", "Sounds like you are, and it is.", "That\u2019s your loss then, cause he seems like a far better person than you.", "Well then you're not going to get a 'happy family' life until you do. Did you ever ask your stepfather if it actually hurt him, because it sounds more like youre projecting a fantasy. Your parents have made it very clear they've accepted him as he is and won't pick you over him, so its up to you to figure out where this anger is coming from and fix it. YTA.", "It clearly is a grudge.", "He's probably better off without you in his life. You're a terrible brother.", "What are you expecting then? Because your behavior has been a red flag from the start. Exactly *why* did & do you believe that your want for your brother to accept your stepdad outweighed his own feelings? \n\nAfter how you flipped on him I'm sure he's better off without you around because you don't seem like a good person for him to have in his life. You need some therapy also because the way you think & behave isn't good imo.", "Bruh supposedly even you dad thinks you're wrong. I don't believe this is a real post.", "Had the exact same thought. Both boys needed grief counseling. Calling someone dad after a couple months of knowing them and tossing your brother aside for this pseudo father figure is messed up.", "OP is male", "And at this point a shitty son to.", "And so will his parents."]}
