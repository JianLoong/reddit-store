Good luck.", "YTA you are holding something against your brother that wasn\u2019t even done to you. Your brother is an individual with his own relationship with your father and his own way of dealing with his loss. Not everyone can jump into having a step parent.

He chose to address him a certain way and you had a problem with it.  He argues because you all were forcing a relationship. That is such a bs thing to do.

He is better off without you.", "Question, does he still treat your step dad like that?", "Yeah, YTA. He was a child and it was difficult to see his mother with another man.

But that doesn't make it a good decision. That doesn't make it reasonable either. \n\nI'll stop short of calling you an asshole. Not so much because I don't have enough information. (You said what caused this division when he was only 13 years old, but I have no idea what happened after that. Maybe there's more to the story and it's more reasonable than it sounds.) This is not an INFO. Your adult brother is emphatically *not* an asshole for how he behaved at the age of 13 while dealing more poorly with the trauma of losing his father than you did. But you are not an asshole for not wanting to do the work of resolving your relationship with him right now. All that said, I would encourage you to rethink the decision.

Yta and have done more to hurt your family than your brother ever did", "You are so locked into this vow you made as a teenager that you are willing to hurt your mother and your stepfather and deprive them of Christmas with both of you. \n\nYes, you disrespected your stepfather. The man you chose over your brother. Both of your parents, by your telling, are upset with your intractable decision to cut your brother off. If you really want to honor your father as the father you claim you see him as, you\u2019d let him take the lead on whether you should have ever cut off your brother. But you won\u2019t. \n\nYTA. And still a child.", "God you are an abject failure of a brother.", "YTA", "You are the one breaking your family apart with your nonsense. I am so thankful my siblings aren't like you.", "So what you're saying is that your brother acted like a teenager ?", "Your answer only addressed what you observed between your brother and stepdad.  What directly did your brother do to you that wronged you?", "He was a child who probably felt like his father was being replaced/erased. He obviously handled his grief differently than you did, and lost you in the process. I imagine this entire thing has been profoundly difficult for him. YTA.", "You lost your father and THREW your brother away. You are one of the saddest excuses of a brother I have ever heard of. He was a CHILD he didn\u2019t deserve that. His relationship with your mom and stepdad is his not yours.", "YTA. He was a teenager and probably dealing with his own loss. You can't force relationships. Lots of teenagers go through a rough time, whether it's their bio parents or step.  If your parents disagree with you and are threatening not to come, that is very telling.  Seems like you're stuck  holding grudges against your brother. You're not the golden child you think you are.", "He was a teenager being a teenager.", "Oh oops. Thanks friend.", "    OP can\u2019t force a relationship, but it\u2019s also STUPID for brother to be mad at OP for not disliking stepdad just because he did.\n\n\n\nOP cut the brother off for that exact reason - because he\u2019s made that his brother disliked the stepdad even though he didn\u2019t. So your argument makes OP a hypocrite.\n\nYTA", "YTA\u2026 completely. I\u2019m sorry but just because you were able to replace your own father so easily, doesn\u2019t mean your brother was. Yikes.", "YTA if he was still acting disrespectful in front of you my answer would be different. Your stepdad clearly wants him there.", "Well, since you don't care how your \"boundary\" is affecting your mom and stepdad the damage is truly done. YTA. Your brother was under no obligation to treat your stepfather as a father.", "You caused all the damage imo. YTA", "Holy Hell. YTA, a hundred times over. He was an 8 year old child who lost his father, and then had a stranger show up and try to replace him. Your punishing an innocent person for grieving. He is under no obligation to accept this man as a parental figure, let alone refer to him as Dad. It may have been easy for you to forget your father and replace him, but your brother is his own person.", "Question what makes you think you brother wants a relationship with you after what YOU have done and said?", "He matured more than you. He can be civil with your stepdad for family' sake, but you cant be civil with him not even for the duration of one dinner. YTA.", "Your parents refused to come to your home because you excluded your brother so they seem to still consider him part of the family. \n\nI don't see or speak to my father, my brothers both do. It doesn't impact our relationship with each other. They still come to my home on Christmas Eve and we see each other at our mother's home on holidays. \n\nYTA. Your brother isn't obligated to have the same relationship with your stepfather that you chose to have.", "That's an AH statement right there. He and sf aren't close and never will be by the looks of it. You basically threw your brother away for another man that's not his father or yours for that matter and smiled while doing it. So now you're upset as your parents didn't show up for a holiday. That's your own fault. Don't blame him. His relationship with your stepdad is HIS not yours. You were/are a horrible big sister. Just the audacity to assume he conforms to how YOU think it should be is very karenesque.", "You don\u2019t have to have everyone in your life tied together into a nice neat nuclear family.  You could have a relationship with your mom and stepdad, and a separate relationship with your brother.", "Your new family, sounds like you were/are just looking for a justification to exclude him. \n\nWere you a little jealous of his relationship with your father?", "Well you don't get to decide whether or not he's part of the family...seems like your mum and step-dad still consider him family, so if you want to be part of 'their family' you'll have to deal with him.\n\nYou can chose to have no/minimal relationship with your brother, but trying to kick him out of 'your family' (which is an absolutely weird way to describe it, like your claiming mum and sdad for yourself and only yourself) is taking it to far and you have no right to force your parents to entertain your idea of a family without your brother", "I guess nothing that directly affected my, though we had some nasty fights about his treatment towards our stepfather. I guess I just didn't want to have a relationship with anyone who treated my stepfather that way.", "Op is a man", "I know I'm not the golden child, I don't expect to get anything out of this. At this point it isn't a grudge, I just don't want him in my life again.", "No worries!", "OP is a guy and not his brother\u2019s sister.", "He IS my father, in every way that counts. I could handle them not being close, I just could not tolerate the way he disrepected him.", "Not at all. Our father was never one to pick favorites from what I remember.", "You literally chose your step father over your little brother who was acting like a teenager. He lost his father then his sister. He must feel so alone.", "You\u2019re a bully who attempted to force a 13 year old kid, dealing with grief, to do what you wanted so YOU COULD FEEL OK ABOUT YOUR NEW FAMILY!", "So you put a new person in your life over your brother? You should have been your brother's closest ally.", "So you chose a new person who you internalized what you saw as slights and decided to end a sibling relationship because he didn\u2019t accept your step father and that upset you even though nothing was done to you. None of what you did was normal. Get therapy because this shows serious daddy issues and attachment issues", "Thanks .. I must have missed that lmao. I fixed it", "But it is a grudge you whichever way you slice it. And you're the one hurting your family, not him. Your parents recognized that as he was a kid at the time. You're a shitty brother.", "It wasn't your place to tolerate anything between the two of them. Everyone else has moved on but you. You and you alone is the cause of the familial fracture, not your brother. You may have been able to just push your father aside but your brother could not. Before you try to retort you didn't. You were calling another man dad within a few months of meeting him, that says a lot. That pretty much says it all. So now your parents skipped out on you and odds are they will continue to do so because of your actions and your actions alone."]}
