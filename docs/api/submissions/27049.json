Hannah is on the spectrum and has some challenges because of her autism. These challenges were made worse in the last three months when she lost both her parents (mom and stepdad) and then came to live with two strangers (husband and I) while also not having contact with the \"step\" siblings she has known since she was 2 years old. The loss of contact with her stepsiblings is their choice. They are all older than Hannah and do not consider her their family/sister and did not wish to remain in touch with her now that their father is dead.\n\nMy husband has been incredibly angry with her stepsiblings for having no interest in Hannah. He has spent the last three months trying to contact them and guilt them into being part of her life. While I feel like Hannah needs therapy but I need him to get on board with it and help me. \n\nMy husband hadn't seen Hannah since she was 18 months old. I never met her. So this has been an adjustment for everyone but she struggles with strangers naturally so to have all this happen, she is not coping well. But my husband focuses less on getting Hannah the help she needs and acts as though the only thing that can/will help is to force her stepsiblings to stay in touch with Hannah.\n\nI think it would help but it can't be forced either or they might take it out on Hannah. I have told him we cannot make them stay in touch with her.\n\nThe other day my husband and his parents were complaining about her stepsiblings and he was like \"I'm going to DM them again and try to get an answer.\" I told him he needs to focus more on Hannah right now and less on yelling at people (through DMs) because nothing he has done so far in pestering these people has helped Hannah. I pointed out we need to figure out where we stand on getting Hannah therapy because the case worker is still involved and we can't make any decision we want for her currently.\n\nMy husband's parents said I had no right to speak to him that way and I should be just as disgusted as he is with these adults who don't care about their own sibling. My husband, at least, seemed to get a bit of a wakeup call when I spoke and he told his parents it was fine. But they told me there is no reason to speak to my life partner the way I spoke to him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694945459, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kwwzr/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_needs_to_focus/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In the other words, step sibilings have cut out contact because they are afraid they'd have to take Hannah in.

It's a shame they don't want to include Hannah in that process but it's shitty of your husband to continue to hound them about it.", "NTA\n\nIt's difficult when your husband is in a frenzy of control freakery, upon the surprise addition of another dependent, which, if handled reasonably well, will siphon his wallet, distract you from attention to him, and, indeed, require him to offer parental efforts to his sibling's child, personally. He has no right to expect stepsiblings to do anything, but he wants to pretend otherwise and such desperation is based on fear.\n\nPerhaps let him know that you understand he's impacted and it can seem overwhelming and it's even worse when other people who could move up fade back instead. Maybe find a moment to do something he finds special for him alone, as even he needs reassurance over this.

They are deeply grieving and not the solution to anyone else's problem.\n\nI think your husband has misdirected some of his intense and confusing feelings about the upheaval of your settled life and struggle to understand and support Hannah into anger at the remaining elements of the family unit destroyed by tragedy. \n\nSupporting Hannah's relationships with the extended/blended family could be something to work on in the future. Harrassing them and making demands is not appropriate, now or later.\n\nYour husband is harrassing grieving children who just lost both their parents. That is very bad. He should sincerely apologize, accept their grieving at their own pace, and leave them alone until THEY reach out.", "NTA\n\nI think they're avoiding conversation with your husband because they think he's trying to dump her off onto them.  \n\nThat perspective might get him to back off.  He's making it worse and they're going to block him everywhere.  \n\nHe's too focused on the wrong thing.  Repeatedly banging your head into a wall isn't going to make a door appear, so you have to find the door instead or your just going to hurt yourself over and over for absolutely no reason.  \n\nAdvise him that frustrating himself isn't helping anyone at all, especially not Hannah.  He needs to let go of something he literally cannot change.  He'll be able to focus better on Hannah's care.\n\nThankfully Hannah has you in her life.  Thank you for advocating for her.  I'm sure she would thank you if she knew everything that you're doing for her here.  Keep at it.  You're helping someone who literally cannot help herself.\n\nCan you reach out to the caseworker and see if they have options for therapy for Hannah?  \n\nGet the ball rolling in the right direction since your husband is too focused elsewhere.", "NTA.  You are correct.  He needs to focus his energy toward something that will actually be useful.  Guilting the stepsiblings isn\u2019t working and he can\u2019t force them to be part of Hannah\u2019s life.", "NTA\n\nYour husband doesn't need to get an answer from her step siblings. He already has one. He doesn't like it, but he has it.", "What\u2019s going to happen when they report him for harassment?", "Nta you're right, your husband needs to focus on what Hannah really needs right now. \n\nYou can't force people to be in someone's life.", "NTA. Husband is probably projecting - he wasn\u2019t a part of her life, and now he\u2019s hell bent on shaming others for not being in her life. Beyond what you said to him, are the step siblings going to be positive for Hannah? Are they kind and patient with her? Do they have any capacity to give anything following the death of their father?\n\nIt\u2019s easier to be angry than to be afraid, and I think your husband and in-laws are living in that. Hopefully you can refocus them on what\u2019s important moving forward, rather than unproductive anger.", "NTA and I agree that, if people's time energies are limited (and they usually are, unless they are a legit superhero) then those energies should be focused on more directly helping Hannah, not trying to force others to do so. \n\nHugs to all of you.", "NTA. Your husband wants to blame someone, you want to solve the problem. He wants a fight, you want to build a family. Husband needs therapy, for his anger, and probably grief at the loss of his sister.", "NTA. They have made their choice. Realistically, if they get guilted into having a relationship with Hannah, it's never going to be a proper one. \n\nYou're right, your husband needs to focus on getting Hannah settled and the help she needs vs holding on to anger over something he probably won't ever change. \n\nAlso! If he keeps harassing them, they could take it to a legal level. Not worth it.", "Maybe the step siblings have a good reason for not wanting to be in Hannah life, maybe your husband is putting all his anger on having to take in Hannah he hasn\u2019t seen for 14 years onto them. Whatever it is, he need to get his head out of his *** and either step up for Hannah or realize he can\u2019t and leave her to someone else. He isn\u2019t helping her by doing this. NTA", "NTA he's only chasing up the step siblings because he wants to fob off his autistic niece on them.", "**NTA**\n\n>My husband hadn't seen Hannah since she was 18 months old. I never met her.\n\nIt seems that your husband was in fairly low contact with his sister who died and her family.   Were his parents in Hannah's life?   They seem to have some fairly strong/inappropriate opinions for people who were not involved.\n\nYou are 100% correct, arguing about her step-siblings is in no way helpful.  It does nothing for her and she is no doubt aware of the conflict going on.  Focus on her: You and your husband can get involved with a local support group for parents/guardians of autistic teens and get as much help from social services as possible\n\nYour in-laws are totally out of line and their comment makes me wonder what kind of marriage/family life they actually have.", "I'm going to assume Hannahs mother was your hubby's sister.\n\nWhy had he not seen her for 14 years?  What about his parents? Have they not seen their grandchild?\n\nHer step siblings, whilst awful for Hannah, have absolutely no responsibility to accept her (seemingly, they never accepted her).  So your husband and his holier than thou parents are being ridiculous.  It's like they're trying to put responsibility for Hannah on the step sibs. Which frankly is disgusting.\n\nYou never met this child, yet you seem to be the only one thinking of her and what she needs.\n\nAsk her case worker about therapy for her (and all of you)\n\nNTA", "NTA. Hannah isn't their responsibility and he's going to get into some legal trouble for harassment if he carries on.

The step siblings have no wish to maintain contact with their step sister. If he continues to harass them he is likely to walk into a harassment order or equivalent. None of this ranting helps his niece, What will help is therapy. Building a bond with your husband and you.  \n\nNTA", "NTA, husband is definitely TA. Will your husband get over it when police start delivering restraining orders from the step siblings? That is the next step in this process, that\u2019s how these things work, and your husband will suffer *permanent* legal issues involving background checks by having restraining orders sworn out against him.\n\nHe can let it go or a judge can instruct him to let it go, it\u2019s his choice.", "NTA. You\u2019re 100% right and that poor girl needs counseling. He can be as mad and as disgusted as he wants, but you nailed it, that won\u2019t solve anything. You can\u2019t force them. It\u2019s time to engage and help this girl, you\u2019re all she has now. She needs services to help her cope with this devastating loss, as well as her diagnosis, so that she can transition into functional adulthood.", "NTA. Youve been dealing with his bitterness and inaporopriste behavior fir months. Talk to your husband again away from his parents. Tell him that he cannot force the step-siblings to take an interest in Hannah. Im guessing that the blended family experience wasnt a positive one for them. He does need to be careful because the steps could be file charges fir harassment. \n\nThe ficus should be on setting Hannah up for sucess.", "NTA, but putting yourself in a position for your in-laws to comment on your marriage is a mistake.", "NTA No amount of yearning or crusading will change their minds. Why would you want such shit siblings for her anyway? \n\nIt's a scary situation, and he's latched on to a concrete plan. It's understandable, but time to move on and work within the means you have and not waste time wishing things were different. \n\nHe can step up and be a figure of safety and welcome or he can be disconnected and angry.", "NTA .and he's risking getting in trouble with the Police harassing these people.", "Your in-laws should shut up and stay out of your marriage. NTA.", "NTA. Your husband has his priorities all wrong.\n\nYes it is outrageous that those people just decided not to talk to her. It's a really shitty move. I doubt you'd disagree with that. \n\nBut you are right, he needs to focus on the person that is right there. She definitely needs therapy. She's in a new environment with people she barely knows and one of them is too busy screaming at other people instead of trying to get to know her and her needs.", "NTA that child needs support and love and care, not for someone to go in an angry vendetta against people that can't be forced to give a shit. Also, you have every right to express your opinion to your partner. Your husband's parents reaction is suspicious as fuck to me. I don't want to outright say that it's sexism, because I don't know your gender, but it's very weird to say that you can't talk to him like that when you clearly should be allowed to voice your opinion.", "NTA. He can DM them til he block them. They clearly do not care and feel she\u2019s a burden they got rid of. Your husband needed to hear this and refocus to help Hannah and stop trying to shove her off on others who washed their hands of her.", "NTA, you are correct in that the focus should be on Hannah and how to reach her. Which would also include therapy. A therapist should be able to help you guys connect with Hannah and help your husband focus more on her also. No one will listen to you right now, even if you give good advice. Try to find a therapist ASAP and this should bring the noise\u2019 down to a level where everyone can begin to listen.", "NTA. They all needed to hear the truth. It is easier to crap talk stepsiblings then admit that formaly taking a high ground isn't enough. Taking in Hannah isn't enough. That kid needs help and they are ignoring the issue. I'm glad your husband had a wake up call.\n\nThank you OP for making Hannah your priority. That kid desperately needs someone in their corner. Ignore your in laws and keep your husband on the right track.\n\nYou have a kid now. That means different priorities and much higher stakes. You two are all she has. Good luck, keep what you've been doing!", "NTA\n\nShe desperately needs a neurodiversity affirming therapist to help her process her grief (I wish I had this when my mum died, as an autistic person I did not find NT therapy helpful and disengaged as a result.) \n\nI guess your husband is also grieving, which could be a factor in his anger? He should probably seek therapy too\u2026 in fact therapy for all! It\u2019s a huge adjustment.", "NTA. I feel for your husband. He sounds like a \"fixer\" who's focused on something he thinks he can fix. Unfortunately he can't fix this. Maybe he feels he's out of his depth in this situation and this feels like the one thing he \"knows how to tackle\", unfortunately as you and everyone else has pointed out this isn't where the focus needs to be. \n\nIf you can help to gently guide him into perspective on how best to help Hannah that's probably the best way to go about it. This situation is hard. Best of luck ti all of you.", "NTA. You see it *all the time* in the posts where flying monkeys crawl out of the woodwork to try to poke, prod, harass, and harangue people into taking on responsibility that they neither want nor have to take on. Simply put, it\u2019s far easier to harass someone else into taking responsibility, than it is to take responsibility themselves.", "NTA Your concern is for the child.  Tell him gently, instead of fussing, how much this child needs a father and mother figure.  Tell him that he needs to pray that her step siblings will come to their senses.  Time changes things, but forcing her on them will only make them hate her more.  In the meantime, search for other young people that she can relate to and give her every chance to overcome what she can and to learn that all people are not as unaccepting as her step siblings.  The focus has to be on her development, not theirs.", "NTA. Next time they point that out, simply tell them that you are focusing on her needs and not focusing in anger. As a parent with a child in the spectrum I'm soooooo glad Hannah has you. She will need love ajd support from everyone around her. It will be difficult for a bit, but once you navigate through that things will be so much better for all of you. Her stepsiblings will have their own regrets sometime later in lifevim sure. He needs to forget about them. And you are definitely NTA for pointing that out. Good luck OP.", "NTA you right to call him out and surely her grandparents should be important to her? Or have they been absent all 14 years too?", "Nope.  You're right.  He can't force them to do something they don't want to and needs to stop expending energy on futility and put it into supporting his neice.", "NTA.  Sounds like the step siblings need to make it impossible for your husband to contact them in any way.   Or they need to consider legal steps to prevent his continued harassment...", "Nta. He can\u2019t control other people, he can only control himself.", ">these adults who don't care about their own sibling\n\nHannah isn't their sibling. Hannah is the child of someone that one of their parents married.    \nWhen will people learn that you can not force a familial bond. Either it's there or it isn't, and what he's doing is causing resentment where there wasn't any.   \nThey have absolutely no obligation towards Hannah. Zero. None.    \nNTA", "NYA. Your in-laws sound misogynistic, though", "NTA seems like there is a really weird family dynamic here... You're definitely not the a******... And his parents should never have talked to you like that period.\n\nI feel like your husband is feeling a little resentment because he has to take care of her and all of her needs that's what I'm reading into this so maybe a bigger deep dive and a conversation with your husband starting with how do we feel about taking care of her moving forward... I think there in lies the issue you both need to get on the same page regardless if it's about actions or intent... again I feel you both need to get on the same page about what is the most important thing here. \n\nAnd regarding therapy and accommodations, did she not have any in place previously? Or do you live further away from what used to be her home area and that is also the issue is finding new therapists or therapy... With that said if that is the case if it is drivable I would suggest continuing on with her current therapist and/or accommodations she had for more consistency and comfort. People with autism prefer routine routine makes them more comfortable and in term will be able to make them feel supported and be able to communicate more effectively with you potentially what their future needs may be.\n\nGood luck!", "OP isn't wrong, but I think what she's missing is that her husband probably is acting out because he's not happy, on some level, about taking responsibility for Hannah.\n\nWhich is not crazy. It's a huge responsibility, and if he's otherwise stepping up, he gets full credit for that.\n\nIt's fine to admit it's hard, or not what he wants, but my guess is he feels like he can't say that for fear of looking like a bad guy. But, he's almost surely feeling overwhelmed, even drowning. So he focuses that negative feeling on the step sibs. It's a form of displacement.", "That's what I thought, too. They \"have no interest\" in Hannah? What about him?! He probably wants these step-siblings to take on some of her care.", "> I wouldn't rule out a possibility that older sibiling were forced to take care of Hannah and their parents tried to make them responsible for her future.\n\nEven if they weren't made to feel responsible for her,  just having to constantly make accommodations, even sacrifices can be a reason to distance themselves.    OP doesn't mention anything about the actual relationship, as in were they living with their bio-mom or with their dad as youngsters.   Nor is there anything about the financial arrangements that were in place when the niece's parents died.\n\nIn other words, there are many, many reasons the step-siblings may have been relieved to be absolved of any responsibility.", "You\u2019re right on the money. It also gives him something to \u201cfix.\u201d", "Yes. Also, they are adult, but it's possible that an age gap is not big, for example they are 20-22 years old, in college, starting jobs or family, renting an apartment with a group of friends...
