Hannah is on the spectrum and has some challenges because of her autism. These challenges were made worse in the last three months when she lost both her parents (mom and stepdad) and then came to live with two strangers (husband and I) while also not having contact with the \"step\" siblings she has known since she was 2 years old. The loss of contact with her stepsiblings is their choice. They are all older than Hannah and do not consider her their family/sister and did not wish to remain in touch with her now that their father is dead.\n\nMy husband has been incredibly angry with her stepsiblings for having no interest in Hannah. He has spent the last three months trying to contact them and guilt them into being part of her life. While I feel like Hannah needs therapy but I need him to get on board with it and help me. \n\nMy husband hadn't seen Hannah since she was 18 months old. I never met her. So this has been an adjustment for everyone but she struggles with strangers naturally so to have all this happen, she is not coping well. But my husband focuses less on getting Hannah the help she needs and acts as though the only thing that can/will help is to force her stepsiblings to stay in touch with Hannah.\n\nI think it would help but it can't be forced either or they might take it out on Hannah. I have told him we cannot make them stay in touch with her.\n\nThe other day my husband and his parents were complaining about her stepsiblings and he was like \"I'm going to DM them again and try to get an answer.\" I told him he needs to focus more on Hannah right now and less on yelling at people (through DMs) because nothing he has done so far in pestering these people has helped Hannah. I pointed out we need to figure out where we stand on getting Hannah therapy because the case worker is still involved and we can't make any decision we want for her currently.\n\nMy husband's parents said I had no right to speak to him that way and I should be just as disgusted as he is with these adults who don't care about their own sibling. My husband, at least, seemed to get a bit of a wakeup call when I spoke and he told his parents it was fine. But they told me there is no reason to speak to my life partner the way I spoke to him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694945459, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kwwzr/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_needs_to_focus/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that your husband has not seen his niece for 14 years implies a problematic situation. I wouldn't rule out a possibility that older sibiling were forced to take care of Hannah and their parents tried to make them responsible for her future. In the other words, step sibilings have cut out contact because they are afraid they'd have to take Hannah in. Your husband insistence makes this worse, it's like screaming \"come back and take her!!!\". Maybe siblings will be more willing to keep in touch if they know this is not the case?", "Is it disgusting that the stepsiblings don't want any contact with Hannah? Perhaps, I don't know what the relationship was before\n\nIs it in any way shape or form relevant? No! Not even remotely!\n\nRight now your husband is only wasting time that could be used to make better arrangements for Hannah.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I\u2019m glad your husband has some sense knocked into him. Wishing you all the best in taking care of your niece!", "NTA your husband keeps this up and the step siblings are gonna (HOPEFULLY) file harassment charges. Hannah isn't their problem and he needs to get that through his head", "NTA and your focus should *definitely* be on getting your poor neice into therapy.\n\nAs for her step-siblings, they're grieving too. It's a shame they don't want to include Hannah in that process but it's shitty of your husband to continue to hound them about it.", "NTA\n\nIt's difficult when your husband is in a frenzy of control freakery, upon the surprise addition of another dependent, which, if handled reasonably well, will siphon his wallet, distract you from attention to him, and, indeed, require him to offer parental efforts to his sibling's child, personally. He has no right to expect stepsiblings to do anything, but he wants to pretend otherwise and such desperation is based on fear.\n\nPerhaps let him know that you understand he's impacted and it can seem overwhelming and it's even worse when other people who could move up fade back instead. Maybe find a moment to do something he finds special for him alone, as even he needs reassurance over this. Yes, it's an addition to your already massively and suddenly stretched mental load, so there's your self care to put first before all that.\n\nGet the child counseling, free, local school, even out of pocket if necessary, so that it's immediately available to her, shopping for anyone warm with whom the child can form a comfortable bond. You can encourage the child to work with you to create a private quiet darkenable sleep space with a supply of water and nutritious snacks, with some decor in her favorite colors, and together select some routine activities where she can talk to you and you can listen and she can feel as if an adult is literally at her side. \n\n**Thank you for being there for this child.**", "NTA, however as step siblings they should not be shamed & nobody should try to force them to be involved with Hannah as they are not blood relatives & Hannah is t be fair not their responsibility.", "NTA. But why do you have to fully resolve the stepsibling issue in order to get whatever help is available for niece? And if he's so stubborn, why can't he rant and rave and be ridiculous WHILE you are getting real help? And it doesn't sound like you spoke rudely to husband.", "NTA. Although it\u2019s sad that the step siblings don\u2019t want to stay in contact, it\u2019s their choice. You and your husband have no idea what went on while Hannah was growing up, so maybe they have valid reasons for resentment about how they were treated after Hannah came into their lives. How do you even know if it would help?  Your husband needs to stop trying to force them back into her life and you both need to focus on what the two of you can do to make Hannah feel safe and loved.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They are deeply grieving and not the solution to anyone else's problem.\n\nI think your husband has misdirected some of his intense and confusing feelings about the upheaval of your settled life and struggle to understand and support Hannah into anger at the remaining elements of the family unit destroyed by tragedy. \n\nSupporting Hannah's relationships with the extended/blended family could be something to work on in the future. Harrassing them and making demands is not appropriate, now or later.\n\nYour husband is harrassing grieving children who just lost both their parents. That is very bad. He should sincerely apologize, accept their grieving at their own pace, and leave them alone until THEY reach out.", "NTA\n\nI think they're avoiding conversation with your husband because they think he's trying to dump her off onto them.  \n\nThat perspective might get him to back off.  He's making it worse and they're going to block him everywhere.  \n\nHe's too focused on the wrong thing.  Repeatedly banging your head into a wall isn't going to make a door appear, so you have to find the door instead or your just going to hurt yourself over and over for absolutely no reason.  \n\nAdvise him that frustrating himself isn't helping anyone at all, especially not Hannah.  He needs to let go of something he literally cannot change.  He'll be able to focus better on Hannah's care.\n\nThankfully Hannah has you in her life.  Thank you for advocating for her.  I'm sure she would thank you if she knew everything that you're doing for her here.  Keep at it.  You're helping someone who literally cannot help herself.\n\nCan you reach out to the caseworker and see if they have options for therapy for Hannah?  \n\nGet the ball rolling in the right direction since your husband is too focused elsewhere.", "NTA.  You are correct.  He needs to focus his energy toward something that will actually be useful.  Guilting the stepsiblings isn\u2019t working and he can\u2019t force them to be part of Hannah\u2019s life.", "NTA\n\nYour husband doesn't need to get an answer from her step siblings. He already has one. He doesn't like it, but he has it.", "What\u2019s going to happen when they report him for harassment?", "Nta you're right, your husband needs to focus on what Hannah really needs right now. \n\nYou can't force people to be in someone's life.", "NTA. Husband is probably projecting - he wasn\u2019t a part of her life, and now he\u2019s hell bent on shaming others for not being in her life. Beyond what you said to him, are the step siblings going to be positive for Hannah? Are they kind and patient with her? Do they have any capacity to give anything following the death of their father?\n\nIt\u2019s easier to be angry than to be afraid, and I think your husband and in-laws are living in that. Hopefully you can refocus them on what\u2019s important moving forward, rather than unproductive anger.", "NTA and I agree that, if people's time energies are limited (and they usually are, unless they are a legit superhero) then those energies should be focused on more directly helping Hannah, not trying to force others to do so. \n\nHugs to all of you.", "NTA. Your husband wants to blame someone, you want to solve the problem. He wants a fight, you want to build a family. Husband needs therapy, for his anger, and probably grief at the loss of his sister.", "NTA. They have made their choice. Realistically, if they get guilted into having a relationship with Hannah, it's never going to be a proper one. \n\nYou're right, your husband needs to focus on getting Hannah settled and the help she needs vs holding on to anger over something he probably won't ever change. \n\nAlso! If he keeps harassing them, they could take it to a legal level. Not worth it."]}
