When I was born he took off completely, denied responsibility, and got off without having to pay child support because he was too low income. \n\nOn the other hand my mom was awesome. She started working as a receptionist in a bank, where she met my stepdad (I actually refer to him as my \"dad\" but I'll call him stepdad in this post to avoid confusion).  I was around 4 when she met him, so I was still fairly young. After meeting me and my mom he decided to go on leave from his teaching job in the US so he could spend more time with us. \n\nMy stepdad is the best man I've met. He was more than happy to treat me as his own son. We had a pretty strong bond from the get-go. When I was around 6/7, it was time for us to move to the US and he wanted to make things \"official\" by adopting me. He did not need to adopt me to sponsor my green card but both of us wanted to seal the deal so we did that.\n\nIn order for him to adopt me, my biological father needed to give up on his parental rights but he was *unreachable*. So unreachable, that even after the court summoned him he still did not show up. The judge then took away his parental rights, and in a few months I was legally adopted by my stepdad.\n\nWe moved and 14 years went by. I'm now a 21 yo in college. During this time, I haven't heard from my biological father up until last month, when he messaged request me on Facebook. In the message he claimed he didn't know I moved to the US but that it was cool. I ignored it. He then sent more messages all within the realm of \"I'm sorry\" \"I regret letting you go\" etc. \n\nI thought he was being genuine, people *do* regret their decisions and he was pretty young. So, I replied telling him not to be too tough on himself and that it all turned well for me. He then replied telling me that in a way I only had this good life because of his decision to leave so it wouldn't hurt if I repaid him. I left him on read. The next day he tried again saying \"it's not uncommon for people in America to send money to their families down here,\" that struck I nerve so I replied saying that \"my *family*  does get support from my parents.\" \n\nHe then said \"so everyone but your dad is getting love?\" I admit that I lost a little bit of self control after reading that and sent a text telling him that my *dad* gets a lot of love from me, I just don't share such love with strangers. I proceeded to block him because I did not want to deal with any of this crap.\n\nI told my boyfriend about the situation and he scolded me. He said that I was being too harsh on a person who apologized and who had the humility to ask for help, that I was humiliating my biological father for being poor. I now feel bad and wonder if I crossed the line. I did not mean to humiliate him, I just got upset at the \"everyone but your dad\" comment.\n\nWas I too out of line?
