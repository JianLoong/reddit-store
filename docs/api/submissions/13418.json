My parents divorced when I was a kid and my dad remarried when I was 11. My step mom already had two kids, my step sister who is the same age as me and my step brother who is three years younger. \n\nI lived most of the time with my dad (I had weekends and some holidays with mom, rest of the time with dad) so I'm very close to my step mom, step siblings and half siblings. Giving that were close we don't often get embarrass around each other and as our house only had two bathrooms for the seven of us we got used to go to the bathroom even if someone was having a shower. We don't have a problem with this at all. This didn't changed even when my eldest siblings and I became teens. I know that is weird for some people but I also know that this is normal in other families too.\n\nMy parents moved a few years ago, my sister still lives with them. Okay so my gf and I went over to their house to have lunch together. Girlfriend and I had tickets to the movies that same day some hours after dinner. So we had to leave but I realize that I don't have my car keys, then I remember that I left them in the bathroom earlier so I told my parents and girlfriend that I will go pick them up. My step sister was having a shower, I knocked and I asked her if my keys were there, she said they are above the counter and allowed me to come in to pick them up. I went into the bathroom, picked my keys from the counter, said goodbye to my sister and then went back downstairs. \n\nWe said goodbye to my parents and left. As soon as we get into the car my girlfriend asks \"did you really just walked into the bathroom when your sister is having a shower?\" I said \"yeah, I left my keys in in the counter, why?\" And she called me a creep. She told me that my sister was an adult and that I just invaded her privacy. I told her that I knocked the door and she allowed me in. But then she asked me why would I think it's okay to do something like this when she's right there. She told me that \"don't look at other women naked\" is a very obvious boundary in a relationship. I think she's exaggerating because my sister is not just a woman for me, she's my family so I think it's obviously different from seeing other women naked.", "created_utc": 1680017094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124se5v/aita_for_going_into_the_bathroom_when_my_step/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have handed items to people through a cracked door showing only my forearm who are not my SO.", "Whoa whoa whoa. Hold up. I was gonna say it's not that big of a deal since there's a shower curtain, but if you saw her naked that changes things. Even if it's normal for you, it's not for most of society including your girlfriend (obviously).\n\nYou're not an asshole though unless you refuse to see where it might be weird for your girlfriend.", "I see both sides of this tbh.\n\nYou're NTA for having these types of boundaries with your family, but your partner is expressing to you that looking at other naked women (family or not) goes against her boundaries and she's letting you know it's making her uncomfortable, which I honestly do think is valid. \n\nIf you care about your girlfriend and want your relationship to work, then you need to respect each others boundaries. If she asks you to not go into a bathroom knowing your naked step sister is in there, then maybe you should respect that request even if you don't find it odd. \n\nIf you two can't come to terms with an agreement on this, it will drive a wedge between you.", "NTA.

You had explicit permission on top of it being a common thing for you guys. Your gf doesn't understand how your guys' household used to run.

But it's important to make your gf understand that you didn't sneak in there to check your naked sister out. There's a huge difference between that and what you did, so she needs to get her mind out of the gutter.", "Everyone in the comments are the weird ones, so is your gf.\n\nYou were there for 2 seconds to grab your keys.

I'm from a similar household but none of my relationship had any issue with us being comfortable around each other naked. Your gf overreacting. Being naked is natural, not sexual, just like breastfeeding.", "what", "NTA - Based on the explanation you have provided, you and your family are pretty open regarding privacy and nudity.  That being said, your girlfriend has a different viewpoint of what feels normal to her.  You have to decide whether or not you will respect your girlfriend's boundaries in the future, if she can get over believing you are a creep.  As someone who grew up in a family with a history of sexual abuse (not within the immediate family) there were rules that my parents put in place that were for our \"protection.\"  It took time for me to understand that other families operated differently and had a different comfort level with what was normal to them.", "NTA\nYou knocked, got permission, grabbed the keys and left. \nHonestly did you even see your step sister?", "NTA", "NTA- You\u2019re allowed to be comfortable with your own family.

Just yikes.", "Is it weird and somewhat inappropriate? Yeah. If you knew she was showering and a clear curtain, it's kinda pervy,  dude.\n\nNTA for asking and having her permission, but also totally see your GF's point. You could have asked her or your mom to get the keys", "NTA\n\nUnless there is more to this that you aren't telling us, your GF needs to grow up and get over herself.\n\nLike is there no shower curtain in the bathroom and your step sister would have just been naked in front of you?", "Edit: I regret what I said about your girlfriend. The image I had in my head was very different. I thought your sister was in a tub shower combo with a curtain.\nYTA; I think you two need to have a conversation about boundaries, expectations, and why this is normal for you but strange to her.", "INFO: Did you look at your sister naked or did you simply grab the keys and left?", "NTA.

You did everything correctly; you knocked on the bathroom door, explained the issue, and were allowed in. If the step sis was uncomfortable, she could simply have handed you the keys herself.\n\nAnd the idea that your partner is not going to look at another person of the opposite sex (or same sex if that's their orientation) naked is decidedly archaic. There's nothing inherently sexual about a naked body. And people will look at what they're attracted to for the rest of their lives. \n\nYour GF sounds controlling.", "NTA. She's having those thoughts, not you. Kinda makes her the creep.", "Dump the girl friend.    Sorta weird, but in your family dynamic.. this is normal so you GF calling you a creep, She\u2019s the AH.  \nNow did you actually see your stepsister naked or you simply turned your head and grab the keys.  Either way, if you and your stepsister have no issues with it than the GF needs to go.  Not the AH based on your description.

There's other people in the world other than you and your sister.  \n\n\nWhich brings us back to your girlfriend. I massively misunderstood the situation. I thought your sister was behind a shower curtain. Can you understand your girlfriend's perspective as to why she may think it's strange you just walk in on a naked family member?  Don't just brush off her concerns; acknowledge them and talk through the differences in your families.   \n\n\nMy family was far more touchy feely than my SO's family and it surprised him when they met.
