My parents divorced when I was a kid and my dad remarried when I was 11. My step mom already had two kids, my step sister who is the same age as me and my step brother who is three years younger. \n\nI lived most of the time with my dad (I had weekends and some holidays with mom, rest of the time with dad) so I'm very close to my step mom, step siblings and half siblings. Giving that were close we don't often get embarrass around each other and as our house only had two bathrooms for the seven of us we got used to go to the bathroom even if someone was having a shower. We don't have a problem with this at all. This didn't changed even when my eldest siblings and I became teens. I know that is weird for some people but I also know that this is normal in other families too.\n\nMy parents moved a few years ago, my sister still lives with them. Okay so my gf and I went over to their house to have lunch together. Girlfriend and I had tickets to the movies that same day some hours after dinner. So we had to leave but I realize that I don't have my car keys, then I remember that I left them in the bathroom earlier so I told my parents and girlfriend that I will go pick them up. My step sister was having a shower, I knocked and I asked her if my keys were there, she said they are above the counter and allowed me to come in to pick them up. I went into the bathroom, picked my keys from the counter, said goodbye to my sister and then went back downstairs. \n\nWe said goodbye to my parents and left. As soon as we get into the car my girlfriend asks \"did you really just walked into the bathroom when your sister is having a shower?\" I said \"yeah, I left my keys in in the counter, why?\" And she called me a creep. She told me that my sister was an adult and that I just invaded her privacy. I told her that I knocked the door and she allowed me in. But then she asked me why would I think it's okay to do something like this when she's right there. She told me that \"don't look at other women naked\" is a very obvious boundary in a relationship. I think she's exaggerating because my sister is not just a woman for me, she's my family so I think it's obviously different from seeing other women naked.", "created_utc": 1680017094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124se5v/aita_for_going_into_the_bathroom_when_my_step/", "score": 367, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
