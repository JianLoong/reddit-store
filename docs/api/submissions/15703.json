My sister and her family live near the beach and my son gets along well with his cousins so it was always a nice experience for him and my sister loved having him. Last year my son begged me not to send him back again after he returned home. The reason why is is the two oldest cousins Ella and Maya. They always had their own rooms (all the kids had) and then my sister and her husband downsized their home. This meant the two oldest girls share and the two youngest girls share and my nephew gets his own room as the only boy. The two oldest girls are apparently not good with the arrangement and now they hate each other. My son said they were always arguing, that he'd hear them at night (nephew's room is right next to theirs and my son always roomed with nephew while he was there). He said it bled into the days and the nights. That the girls couldn't be anywhere together. It was super uncomfortable and my nephew and younger nieces told him it had been like that for months by then. My sister and her family flew into town for Christmas with our parents this year and my son told me Ella and Maya are still at each other's throats and got worse since he last stayed with him. I had noticed tension and I did notice that Ella and Maya were avoiding each other wherever possible. I casually mentioned it to my sister and she said they were being childish and they'll get over it. That they already lost a lot of privileges over the fighting.\n\nI told my son he didn't need to go this year if he really didn't want to. He said he doesn't. That it was not fun last year and he didn't enjoy it like he did other years. So I told my sister he wouldn't be coming this year. She told me she gets that he's 14 now and might think he's too cool for it now but he'll be missed and he and my nephew always loved their time together so can't I change his mind. I explained the reason he wasn't going (that the tension between Ella and Maya got to him last year) and he didn't want a repeat. She told me she could make it so they wouldn't fight and then he could come. I told her I didn't feel like that was realistic given they have been like this for more than a year now and are only getting worse. She told me I should be working with her on this, not doubting her. She also told me I clearly had my mind made up which I should have said. I told her I did say he would not be coming and left no room for doubt. She told me I could still work with her and she hung up.

His reasoning is also very reasonable. That's fine, and truthfully, that should have been the end of it.\n\nMaybe your sister is embarrassed about the situation with her family, having to downsize etc. That would be understandable.\n\nIt's unfair of her to try and pressure you into forcing your son to visit. Just so she can pretend that everything's right as rain in her home, when very obviously, it isn't.\n\nYou could offer to take your nephew for a few weeks this year. That way, he and your son can still bond but without your kid having to be in a toxic household. \n\nI'd argue that that would be \"working with\" family like your sister wanted.

I don't think your sister realizes that.", "Right? The sister is not entitled to the son's participation.", "I think it\u2019s worth proposing.  Getting your nephew out of there would give him a break from the conflict, too.  And one less unhappy teen in the house certainly won\u2019t hurt things (I can\u2019t imagine that your poor niblings are happy with all the conflict, either).  It might be worth suggesting family therapy to your sister.  You can\u2019t punish siblings into liking each other (it really backfires, often spectacularly), so if she doesn\u2019t want her eldest to leave as soon as she can and possibly cut herself off from the family, she\u2019s got to change her tack.", "I don't think she does either. Not only would it not help the tension but I have a hard time imagining it being the same as other years. My son used to do so much there and I feel like most of his and my nephew's time would be spent trying to get away from the house as much as possible. Most likely just the two of them instead of as a group/family.", "Family dynamics change ALL THE TIME -- it's part of life, and your sister is unrealistic if she thinks she can \"work\" to make everything the way it used to be. Forcing your son to go risks driving him further away -- if he goes and has a rotten time, he's likely to dig in his heels and refuse to ever go in the future. But if he takes a year (or two) off, he might want to try going again someday, though no guarantees. But forcing him to go when he doesn't want to is really likely to backfire.", "NTA maybe your nephew could come to yours? Let the girls split up and reduce tension for the summer?", "NTA.

I agree to not forcing your son to go, so points to you, OP. Invite your nephew so the cousins can have fun. Tell your sister you love her and want the cousins to enjoy.

She needs to get over it and concentrate on solving her family problems.", "NAH \n\nShe appears to be doing her best to mitigate this. It\u2019s not successful.

Being away from home that long, in a tense/aggressive environment, isn\u2019t Ok.\n\nSure she\u2019s being a bit pushy but her intent doesn\u2019t seem to be malicious. She knows it\u2019s been a good tradition and doesn\u2019t want to lose it. She\u2019s now facing a consequence of her kids\u2019 behaviors despite her attempts to manage them.

She and her family have to do all the work, you and your son get to stand back and watch how they handle their own family dynamic. \n\nBut there is a layer to this that feels...disturbing. When she's talking about her daughters and she says \"she could make it so they wouldn't fight\" what *exactly* is she planning? She hasn't been able to manage it yet, what is she going to threaten them with or hold over them if you *did* agree? Is she openly blaming them for your son not visiting?

You are right to accept your son's feelings and not force this.", "NTA\u2026why is it so important to her that your son go to her house?   Your so. Is 14.
