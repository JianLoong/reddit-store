{"id": 2354, "submission_id": "yvek4k", "title": "AITA for not wanting my daughter\u2019s half sister to come to her sweet 16?", "selftext": "I (46F) have 4 kids Caleb (18M), Bailey ( almost 16F), Jacob (13M), and Sofia (9F) with my ex husband Mike (47M). Mike and I got divorced 7 years ago when I found he was having an affair and fathered another child outside of our marriage. I was the breadwinner in the family and got a promotion after my divorce, which required me to move out of state with my children. \n\nMy children see their father during school breaks. He\u2019s not with his affair partner but they have joint custody and he has his other daughter Bella (8F) half of the week. He does not make a lot of money but does pay me court-ordered child support.\n\nMy daughter is having a sweet 16 on New Years Eve when she comes back from her dad\u2019s for Christmas break. Her dad couldn\u2019t financially contribute to the sweet 16 so I paid for the whole thing alone but I told my ex he could come. I have also invited his family members as well. Last night my ex called and wanted to know if he could bring Bella. I said I would think about it but honestly I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with it.\n\nI have never met my his other child but seeing my ex is upsetting enough without having to see the physical embodiment of his affair. I know she\u2019s a child and it\u2019s not her fault how she got here, and I also know that she is my children\u2019s half sister so I asked Bailey if she wanted her to come. She said it didn\u2019t really matter to her and they\u2019re not close because of the age difference. She also said Sofia has some sort of sibling rivalry with her so she\u2019d rather not deal with that on her day.\n\nI explained all the reasons to my ex this morning and let him know I was not comfortable with it. He blew up on me and said I was taking my anger out on a little girl and making the rift between her and our children worse. He then started ranting about how it\u2019s my fault that Caleb doesn\u2019t talk to him because of the affair(I didn\u2019t even know), and how Bella is upset because my kids have more things and better clothes than she does. I responded that none of those things were my problem. \n\nHe said that he has Bella that weekend so if she can\u2019t come come, he won\u2019t be able to make it. I told him that he was making a choice not to find other arrangements and he was making a choice not to come to Bailey\u2019s sweet 16, so he needed to be the one to let her know he wasn\u2019t coming. He\u2019s saying I\u2019m the asshole for forcing his hand and that I could just invite Bella.

Otherwise you could have accidentally jeopardized this milestone party with a blow-up family fight. \n\nIf your ex pushes the issue I would says he made the decisions that ultimately hurt your children. There is nothing you can do for him to improve the situation. If he wants a better relationship with his children then he needs to do that himself. (But why waste your breath and energy doing this emotional labor for him, right?)\n\nAlso, if your ex can\u2019t afford to contribute to this party it might be best for Bella not to come. This would reduce  opportunities for stress/disappointment from expecting similar celebrations that he can\u2019t afford.", "NTA. It's wonderful that you seek your daughter's opinion before anything else. Leave the decision to Bailey!", "NTA it\u2019s your daughters birthday and she said it herself that she didn\u2019t want to deal with with her half sister on that day especially since her half sister has a rivalry with her. I think you did the best thing by being cordial with your ex and respecting what your daughter wanted. Who knows maybe your ex will find a babysitter, maybe your daughter will change her mind.", "~~Does Bailey want her half sister there?  my judgment is entirely based off that.~~\n\nNTA, your daughter's fine with her not being there.", "NTA. I don't know many 16 years olds who would want an 8 year old at their birthday party. It doesn't matter if it is a relative or not. Your daugther stated she isn't close because of their age difference which makes perfect sense. Especially since they only see each other on breaks. Also your daughter doesn't want the sibiling rivarly between Sofia and Bailey to disrupt her party. These are all valid reason for her not to come. You ask the birthday girl and she was indifferent to Bella. I get that this is said for Bella, but it's not up to you foster a relationship between them. That is up to the father they share to do.", "NTA. You rightfully left the decision up to the girl being celebrated and you are respecting her decision. It sucks being in a broken family but what makes it worse is having adults try to force everyone into unwanted relationships so they don't have to face the reality of what they did to their kids. Your ex needs to understand that he can't go back to having a happy, intact family like he seems to want. He's trying to force a fantasy where all the kids care about each other so can have his cake and eat it too.", "NTA. You got the birthday girl's opinion and worked out your decision from there. Your ex is dealing the consequences of his decisions that lead to him having a daughter with another woman, and clearly hasn't been able to take responsibility for them if he's blaming you for your son going NC with him. He isn't contributing anything to the party, so he can't make demands of the guest list.", "NTA. Keep doing right by your children. Your daughter stated she didn't really want her there. It's her party. It's his responsibility to find childcare for his daughter if he wants to go.", "You're NTA. If Bailey really wanted her there,  I'd say deal with it, but that is not the case.", "NTA, the birthday girl isn't keen on her being there.  It's her party, if having the kid there was important to her she would have told you.  It sucks for him, but OH WELL. And his trying to guilt you by pointing out that your kids have more than his one does was an attempted low blow. You've worked hard to give your kids a good life.", "NTA- and I'd just tell him... naw, you're the one trying to force things and it's just pissing you off that it's not working. Now that you've gone this route- be very clear do not bring her. This is your doing on every level.  Every level. What you would like is a pass on your conduct because the ramifications are inconvenient.  None are available.", "NTA. How old is this man to have still not learnt there are consequences to actions?", "NTA. Your ex literally fucked around and found out... He's reaping the consequences and he seems to want you to cater to his choices. Sucks to be him.", "NTA.\n\nThe person whose opinion matters most here is Bailey.\n\nYou would be an AH if your only reason for saying no was your personal feelings because Bella is an innocent child and their half-sibling. But if it would just cause drama between Sofia and Bella and Bailey doesn't want that, it is fair to say no.\n\nIt is HIS fault that Caleb doesn't talk to him. Cheating isn't just on your partner - it affects the whole family and how they see you. He chose to have an affair and that destroyed Caleb's desire to talk to him. That is a consequence of a choice he made.\n\nAnd you are right that he has options he is choosing not to take. You aren't 'forcing his hand', you just aren't letting him bully you into doing things his preferred way a.k.a. what is easiest for him and making him take responsibility for his choice if he decides not to attend.", "NTA. \n\nThough I'd ask your daughter if she wants her sister there. It is her birthday after all.\n\nFor the other stuff like how the kid feels slighted that her older siblings have better things to do than her, well that comes with the age gap. You can't expect a teen to want to hang out with an 8 yr. old.\n\nEdit:\nOh birthday girl doesn't really want the kid there due to rivalry with other sister. \n\nJudgement still stands. NTA.", "Nta.  If your daughter wanted her there I would say yta.  But you asked her what she wanted.  Apparently your kids aren't close to her and they have that right.   This isn't about your ex or his daughter.   Its about your daughter and her day.", "NTA - cheating (especially fathering a child) has complications/consequences, all of which are his problems to solve. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA. I doubt they'll have much a relationship, seeing as how she's half your daughter's age. You would be in the clear to say no to her coming, *and* setting the boundary to not bring her to future events. That wouldn't make you the bad guy at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBella can get upset about whatever she gets upset about, she's not your kid and she's not a part of your family. He made a choice to create her, and now he's stuck with it. Bella just happens to share the same father as your daughter. That's not an obligation to babysit her, or to bond with her. Bonding with her would end up being babysitting for Bailey, which is probably why he's so pissed he can't bring her and complaining about the rift in the relationship. It's not fair to expect that of Bailey. She didn't have the affair and create a child, your ex did. His bed, and all that.", "NTA cheaters need to accept their place at the table. Which is not at the table.", "NTA. Let me guess, Ex expects his children from both relationships to be one big happy family and that it is your fault they are not. He can't understand why his oldest son doesn't want to speak to him or love his little sister. Denial isn't a river in Egypt.", "NTA for not wanting her there, but your children will never bond with this girl if she isn\u2019t ever allowed to be around. It\u2019s hard to be separated from your family for something someone else did. \n\nAlso, if your son isn\u2019t speaking to his dad because of something you might have said, that should be your problem. Creating animosity and then allowing for it to continue will just teach your kids that apathy and disdain are good characteristics to have. \n\nYou should want your kids to love their family.", "Surely it's not your decision to make?!\n\nIt's your daughter's birthday so she should have the final say, even though because you're behaving the way you are she may now feel more under pressure to make the \"right\" decision. \n\nYour ex is right. You're punishing a little girl for the mistakes of her father. \n\nBut sometimes we have to make sacrifices for the same of our children and for one day or even an afternoon/evening you can settle.your differences for the sake of your daughter. \n\nYou're only 16 once and it would be a real shame if her one resounding memory was of her parents bickering like children. \n\nAnd with regards to him \"making choices\" regarding someone else taking care of her, if you're inviting all the rest of the family then who exactly is she going to stay with?\n\nLive and let live.
