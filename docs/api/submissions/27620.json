The last residents moved out in August.  \n\n\nWhen I left to go to school, my brother was in a relationship with his longterm girlfriend. Me and her are really close, my mother wasnt into makeup or haircare/skincare so she taught me everything I know. She stood by my brother when he was robbed and stabbed and was his caretaker during that entire period. They have two sons together.   \n\n\nIt ended badly recently, he cheated on her with a woman that has five kids and is now living with her and them. He left my SIL (they were common law married) in the dust since she was a SAHM. I am her guarantor on her apartment since she cant afford to make three times the rent but she found a job that she can afford her rent with. This was back in March.  \n\n\nMy brother and I got into a huge argument about the situation. He hasnt seen my nephews since he moved out, even when they go over to our mothers house while my SIL is at work, yet hes playing stepdad to his girlfriends five kids since none of their fathers are involved. They call him dad and everything and he recently posted about how they went to the courthouse and got married. \n\nHe called me recently crying saying their rent went up 500 dollars and he cant afford it and he drove by my grandmas house and saw it\u2019s getting maintenance work done and its empty so can he please live there once everythings done with his \u201cfamily\u201d since otherwise they\u2019ll be homeless in his car. Might I add, we are half siblings so my grandma that left me the house isnt his. We have the same mother and different fathers.  \n\n\nI told him to be so serious and that I would never allow his so called \u201cfamily\u201d to live there and that Im planning to sell it since the value on it is higher than ever now and to go see his BIO kids who are his real family that he abandoned. He got even more upset and said he cant believe I\u2019d rather sell a house instead of renting to him (at a discount mind you) and Im evil for watching five kids be homeless in a car and to stop choosing his ex over him since hes my brother and he knows I helped his ex get her apartment so Im a huge asshole for not helping his \u201ckids\u201d and I\u2019m their aunt??
