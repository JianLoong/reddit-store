School was very difficult for Jennifer. She had many problems with bullies and a traditional school environment just didn\u2019t accommodate her learning style. Lexi performed very well in that environment. Lexi was able to skip a grade in elementary school and was considered a violin prodigy.\n\nInstead of trying to help Jennifer with her learning struggles or encourage Jennifer\u2019s talents, Mark and Patricia would negatively compare her to Lexi. Things like \u201cLexi has twice as many friends as you, and she\u2019s four years younger!\u201d or \u201cLexi skipped a grade and has all A\u2019s, yet you\u2019re only getting a C in English!\u201d or \u201cLexi can do things that are actually useful.\u201d Mark and Patricia would talk about raising Jennifer and Lexi by saying \u201cThe screw-up always comes before you do something great\u201d \n\nI would stand up for Jennifer because Mark and Patricia were clearly hurting her with such incredibly cruel statements. Mark and Patricia would only respond that we were both being oversensitive. And how their comments were good because they would \u201cmotivate\u201d Jennifer to be \u201cas ambitious and advanced\u201d as her younger sister. \n\nJennifer and Lexi are now adults. Jennifer moved out as soon as she financially could and has had no contact with Mark or Patricia since. Lexi fell into bad habits when she entered college and eventually dropped out of the university. She no longer plays violin. Lexi flips off and curses at her parents. She essentially told Mark and Patricia \u201cFuck you. It\u2019s my life and I\u2019m doing whatever the hell I want with it.\u201d\n\nBecause Lexi is no longer fulfilling their expectations or doing things they can boast about, Mark and Patricia are trying to get back into contact with Jennifer. But Jennifer wants nothing to do with them. Mark and Patricia were complaining because after using a fourth phone number to contact Jennifer (she had just blocked them previously) Jennifer called them out for only contacting her because Lexi was no longer available.\n\nMark and Patricia tried to get sympathy by saying they have no idea why Jennifer has \u201cabandoned\u201d them. I told Mark and Patricia it serves them right that Jennifer wants nothing to do with them. They always made her feel unvalued compared to Lexi. Of course, Jennifer doesn\u2019t want to be their golden child now that Lexi has lost their favor.\n\nMost of the younger family members agree with what I said (including Jennifer.) Because Mark and Patricia would have likely never contacted Jennifer if Lexi was still doing what they wanted. But most of the older family members said that I was an asshole because Mark and Patricia are realizing their mistake and I\u2019m just kicking them when they\u2019re already down. Even if Mark and Patricia were truly sorry for raising Jennifer as if she were less than Lexi, it doesn\u2019t excuse them from the consequences of doing it. But the older family members are saying it wasn\u2019t the time or place to say what I did.

That's being shitty parents that play favorites. Jennifer is 10000% justified in cutting them off, and quite honestly, I hope she fucking crushes everything she pursues in life out of mere spite.", "NTA. Your cousin and his wife should not be allowed to rewrite the history of how they mistreated and emotionally abused their oldest daughter.  I think it was the perfect time to figuratively slap the lie as it was coming out their mouth.", "NTA. What horrible parents to both daughters. They did them a disservice and now they\u2019re facing the consequences of their poor parenting. I\u2019m glad Jennifer wants to connect with Lexi. I hope you can help her with that.", "NTA - I don't view this as kicking them when they're down.  They were toxic, abusive parents to the poor girl and they can't even see what they did that was so bad... Some people pick up on subtle clues, some people need to be smacked repeatedly with a clue bat.  Your cousin and his wife are the latter type.", "NTA. You\u2019re not kicking the parents while down, you\u2019re keeping them accountable, and for that there\u2019s neither a convenient time or place.", "NTA, Mark and Patricia only have themselves to blame.", "NTA. Mark and Patricia are reaping what they've sowed.", "NTA they're \"just now realizing their mistake\"? What a load of bs, it's clear they've been told for years what they were doing was cruel to Jennifer and Lexi. The 'golden child' may make it out better usually, but you've described the exact scenario of how the pressure to be perfect and the constant dragging down of her older sibling for being lesser can suddenly burst. I'm glad Jennifer was able to split as quickly as she had. \n\nI hope they both are able to fully cut contact and not have to deal with these constant unwanted attempts at communicating. You aren't kicking the parents when they're down in my opinion, you just told them how it is.", "NTA.  You merely told them the truth & pointed out their terrible past behavior.  I'm glad Jennifer at least has you there to support her considering how her parents treated her.", "NTA. Mark and Patricia are not going to win \"Parents of the Year\", life time achievements, are they? I think it was perfectly justified to call them out for the horrible way they treated their children, both of whom have been set up for a hard life. Hopefully they'll find people, who can help them going forward.", "NTA. Well, well, well... if it isn't the consequences of their own actions.", "NTA\n\nAh the old generation and \"but faaaamily\" crowd. The older generation need to grow up. Which may be crass but... I don't know what else to say. Rug sweeping and blaming victims that some older folk do (and seems like if one in a family does it, it ends up being a majority for that family... go figure) is just NOT cool. I've cut off family for that myself.", "NTA. You were right to stand up for Jennifer before, since that was clearly harmful behavior. If they had listened to you earlier, maybe both their children wouldn't be NC now. Maybe you can help them talk to each other in the future, but it sounds like they all need therapy.", "Dear OP I am not sure if you are an uncle or aunt but good on you for standing by Jennifer's side during her growing years in a time she is unloved by her parents for not fulfilling their expectations. Having read what you shared, I feel sorry for both Jennifer and Lexi. \n\nI think Lexi snapped and is tired of having to fulfill her parents' expectations. From what you wrote \"She (Lexi) essentially told Mark and Patricia \u201cFuck you. It\u2019s my life and I\u2019m doing whatever the hell I want with it.\u201d \", she could have become disillusioned with the model material and perfect daughter mould she is forced to live with for years and started to rebel. It is not just Jennifer who got hurt I believe\n\nJennifer is not a bad person for choosing to have zero contact with her parents and she clearly knows pretty well what will happen if she becomes the new golden child overnight. Jennifer knows her parents' conditional love on her now would mean she will have to play perfect daughter for them at the expense of her own happiness. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, OP, and you did not kick Mark and Patricia down. No. You dished out the truth in a way of telling them how their conditonal love and playing favourites is harming both sisters and they are now facing the consequences of their actions now. Loving someone conditionally is not the way to live. Straight NTA from me and bravo you being by Jennifer's side all those years.\n\nNice to know Lexi wants to reconnect with Jennifer. Moving forward, you continue supporting both sisters and be there for them. They both are gonna need all the love and support from you.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t realizing their mistakes. They\u2019re betting on a new pony. Jennifer is living her best life without them and they can reap the consequences they\u2019ve sown.", "NTA and I'm glad that the older sister had someone looking out for her. You're probably one of the reasons why she was able to rise above all of that. Having someone in your corner means the world.", "NTA  \nNot at allllll   \nThey were cruel and did they *say they are realizing their mistake*? Or are the relatives just giving them undeserved grace? Either way, like you said--it doesn't excuse them from the consequences. You held your tongue (when you maybe shouldn't have) while it was happening and that stuff is bound to come out. No better time. They need to hear it.", "NTA.\n\nAlso next time these relatives say that they are trying to make up for past mistakes, tell them:\n\n\u201cHow? Now they flipped it and are willing to treat Lexi the way they treated Jennifer. If they learned their errors, they would be trying to help Lexi while mending their relationship with Jennifer.\u201d\n\nYour cousin and his wife don\u2019t deserve to be parents.", "NTA.
