School was very difficult for Jennifer. She had many problems with bullies and a traditional school environment just didn\u2019t accommodate her learning style. Lexi performed very well in that environment. Lexi was able to skip a grade in elementary school and was considered a violin prodigy.\n\nInstead of trying to help Jennifer with her learning struggles or encourage Jennifer\u2019s talents, Mark and Patricia would negatively compare her to Lexi. Things like \u201cLexi has twice as many friends as you, and she\u2019s four years younger!\u201d or \u201cLexi skipped a grade and has all A\u2019s, yet you\u2019re only getting a C in English!\u201d or \u201cLexi can do things that are actually useful.\u201d Mark and Patricia would talk about raising Jennifer and Lexi by saying \u201cThe screw-up always comes before you do something great\u201d \n\nI would stand up for Jennifer because Mark and Patricia were clearly hurting her with such incredibly cruel statements. Mark and Patricia would only respond that we were both being oversensitive. And how their comments were good because they would \u201cmotivate\u201d Jennifer to be \u201cas ambitious and advanced\u201d as her younger sister. \n\nJennifer and Lexi are now adults. Jennifer moved out as soon as she financially could and has had no contact with Mark or Patricia since. Lexi fell into bad habits when she entered college and eventually dropped out of the university. She no longer plays violin. Lexi flips off and curses at her parents. She essentially told Mark and Patricia \u201cFuck you. It\u2019s my life and I\u2019m doing whatever the hell I want with it.\u201d\n\nBecause Lexi is no longer fulfilling their expectations or doing things they can boast about, Mark and Patricia are trying to get back into contact with Jennifer. But Jennifer wants nothing to do with them. Mark and Patricia were complaining because after using a fourth phone number to contact Jennifer (she had just blocked them previously) Jennifer called them out for only contacting her because Lexi was no longer available.\n\nMark and Patricia tried to get sympathy by saying they have no idea why Jennifer has \u201cabandoned\u201d them. I told Mark and Patricia it serves them right that Jennifer wants nothing to do with them. They always made her feel unvalued compared to Lexi. Of course, Jennifer doesn\u2019t want to be their golden child now that Lexi has lost their favor.\n\nMost of the younger family members agree with what I said (including Jennifer.) Because Mark and Patricia would have likely never contacted Jennifer if Lexi was still doing what they wanted. But most of the older family members said that I was an asshole because Mark and Patricia are realizing their mistake and I\u2019m just kicking them when they\u2019re already down. Even if Mark and Patricia were truly sorry for raising Jennifer as if she were less than Lexi, it doesn\u2019t excuse them from the consequences of doing it. But the older family members are saying it wasn\u2019t the time or place to say what I did.

No. You dished out the truth in a way of telling them how their conditonal love and playing favourites is harming both sisters and they are now facing the consequences of their actions.

They knew what they were doing. Not only do I feel bad for Jennifer for dealing with that until she was an adult, I feel bad for Lexi. I would have cracked under the prodigy pressure well before she did. Lexi will be next for no contact. She's now the screw up. The only difference is that they don't have \"something great\" coming after that.", "Is there really a good time and place to say \u201cyou deserve for your kid to hate you\u201d?\ufffc\n\nNo. But sometimes it just needs to be said.\ufffc\n\nNTA", "NTA When you're sincerely remorseful about hurting someone, you don't go to them making demands and acting like they owe you.", "NTA.

There's no way that they didn't realize how hurtful their behavior was. Jennifer is living her life and they should respect her wish of no contact. It appears that their overindulgence of Lexi has also bore fruit, but in a more negative way. I applaud you for sticking up for Jennifer, both when she was younger and now. She is not blind. I'm sure that she can see that her parents only reached out to her after Lexi began to spiral out of control. Why would she want to try to start a relationship with them? There would always be the possibility that they'd toss her aside if Lexi got her act together. Why would she ever put herself in that position? Her whole childhood she was treated as the lesser daughter. Hopefully she's had counseling and will keep her boundaries strong. Her parents are TA and probably toxic for her to be around. Sounds like they only want to have a relationship with her because it benefits them.", "If Mark and Patricia actually wanted to make amends, they'd start by hanging up their phones, and waiting for Jennifer to call *them.*\n\nIt's much easier to repair a relationship when BOTH parties want to.

That's just a consequence of their actions.\n\nNTA\n\nMaybe your timing was harsh, but if they and the older generation had it their way, the proper time to call them out would by about three days after *never.*", "NTA, they sure kicked Jennifer while she was down, so why do they get to complain when the tables are turned?", "NTA.\n\nSome people can still be totally oblivious and need to be told the truth", "NTA props to you for standing up for Jennifer. I hope she is doing well! Mark and Patricia can go take a long walk off a short cliff, they are reaping what they have sown. \n\nThe older gen doesn't get it because they didn't see anything wrong with Mark and Patricia's treatment of Jennifer.

Thank you for standing up for Jennifer, for noticing and for caring that this was happening. Thank you for getting it. \n\nWhat Mark and Patricia did to Jennifer was abuse. What they did to Lexi was also abuse. There is no \u2018realising their mistake\u2019. They are deeply disturbed people who inflicted life-altering damage on both their children. As a general rule these people are incapable of understanding, apologising and making amends. By telling others Jennifer \u2018abandoned\u2019 them and they have \u2018no idea why\u2019 Mark and Patricia are revealing how not sorry they are and that they are incapable of self-reflection and change.

It is very lonely knowing you do not have parents - not in any meaningful sense. \n\nPlease consider reaching out to Lexi too. It may be a complex situation between the siblings because of the evil way their parents pitted them against each other but the golden child does suffer too and it looks like Lexi is not coping too well with realising her loving parents are not loving parents at all but controlling monsters. \n\nI know it may be naive but I can\u2019t help hoping that the sisters are able to reconnect at some point and reclaim the bond their parents\u2019 abuse took from them.", "Mark and Patricia can suck a dick.

They deserve to be tormented in every possible way by their actions.", "OP is NTA. It sounds like Mark and Patricia have no clue about the harm they inflicted on Jennifer. They are not sorry and will continue to deny that they did anything wrong.

Good on you OP for standing up for Jennifer.", "NTA\n\nAbusers aren't owed any sympathy when the proverbial kicked dog bites.", "NTA \u2014 the people we usually need to take advice from the least is the older generation tbh, especially about emotional issues. They have no emotional intelligence lol. Mark and whats her name are a nightmare and serves them right to get consequences for what sounds like the first time in their life. How is shame a motivator? Tell them to read a book and maybe they\u2019ll actually learn how to motivate someone and that shame is not one. Berating Jennifer for having struggles like they\u2019re all knowing and perfect. Eek! You did the right thing.\n\nETA: they openly shamed Jennifer and it was TOTALLLLYY fine! Grow a pair would ya! and now you\u2019re made to feel bad for openly shaming them.
