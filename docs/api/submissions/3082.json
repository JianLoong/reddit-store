School was very difficult for Jennifer. She had many problems with bullies and a traditional school environment just didn\u2019t accommodate her learning style. Lexi performed very well in that environment. Lexi was able to skip a grade in elementary school and was considered a violin prodigy.\n\nInstead of trying to help Jennifer with her learning struggles or encourage Jennifer\u2019s talents, Mark and Patricia would negatively compare her to Lexi. Things like \u201cLexi has twice as many friends as you, and she\u2019s four years younger!\u201d or \u201cLexi skipped a grade and has all A\u2019s, yet you\u2019re only getting a C in English!\u201d or \u201cLexi can do things that are actually useful.\u201d Mark and Patricia would talk about raising Jennifer and Lexi by saying \u201cThe screw-up always comes before you do something great\u201d \n\nI would stand up for Jennifer because Mark and Patricia were clearly hurting her with such incredibly cruel statements. Mark and Patricia would only respond that we were both being oversensitive. And how their comments were good because they would \u201cmotivate\u201d Jennifer to be \u201cas ambitious and advanced\u201d as her younger sister. \n\nJennifer and Lexi are now adults. Jennifer moved out as soon as she financially could and has had no contact with Mark or Patricia since. Lexi fell into bad habits when she entered college and eventually dropped out of the university. She no longer plays violin. Lexi flips off and curses at her parents. She essentially told Mark and Patricia \u201cFuck you. It\u2019s my life and I\u2019m doing whatever the hell I want with it.\u201d\n\nBecause Lexi is no longer fulfilling their expectations or doing things they can boast about, Mark and Patricia are trying to get back into contact with Jennifer. But Jennifer wants nothing to do with them. Mark and Patricia were complaining because after using a fourth phone number to contact Jennifer (she had just blocked them previously) Jennifer called them out for only contacting her because Lexi was no longer available.\n\nMark and Patricia tried to get sympathy by saying they have no idea why Jennifer has \u201cabandoned\u201d them. I told Mark and Patricia it serves them right that Jennifer wants nothing to do with them. They always made her feel unvalued compared to Lexi. Of course, Jennifer doesn\u2019t want to be their golden child now that Lexi has lost their favor.\n\nMost of the younger family members agree with what I said (including Jennifer.) Because Mark and Patricia would have likely never contacted Jennifer if Lexi was still doing what they wanted. But most of the older family members said that I was an asshole because Mark and Patricia are realizing their mistake and I\u2019m just kicking them when they\u2019re already down. Even if Mark and Patricia were truly sorry for raising Jennifer as if she were less than Lexi, it doesn\u2019t excuse them from the consequences of doing it. But the older family members are saying it wasn\u2019t the time or place to say what I did.

No. You dished out the truth in a way of telling them how their conditonal love and playing favourites is harming both sisters and they are now facing the consequences of their actions.
