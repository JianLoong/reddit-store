When my mom was 15, she had this huge crush on my father, she said he was the most handsome guy she had ever seen, he had no idea who she was tho. Three years later they randomly met at an event, my dad asked her out that night and they have been inseparable ever since. \n\nThey were the best parents growing up and still are. I don't have a single memory of them fighting or yelling at eachother and if they did, I never heard them. My dad still gets my mom flowers every week, moved across the country cuz she got a big job opportunity (he loved his hometown), and for about 1-2 years my mom was the earner of the family, supporting my dad who left a job he hated and helping him start his own business. I do believe that they are the definition of soulmates.\n\nNow to the problem. \n\nA few days ago, my parents were talking about a close family friend who had an emergency C-section and how the father had to pick the one who gets saved (both the mother and the baby are fine btw). My dad was saying how lucky they were that my mom's pregnancy and labor went smoothly, and that he could never choose between me and my mother. My mom agreed, saying that she wouldn't be able to pick either. \n\nWell, I intervened and said that it's fine to admit that they would choose eachother instead of me if it came down to it. My parents completly froze. They started asking if they did anything wrong, if I didn't feel loved anymore and how I could think about something like that. \n\nI apologised, told them I didn't mean it that way. But now things are still tense between us and I'm afraid that they might feel as if they are bad parents. But I only said it because I know how much they love eachother and that one couldn't live if something happend to the other.\n\nSo AITA?

Hopefully again, you'll never know that for sure though!", "NAH.  Some discussions are best not had. That's a choice no one should ever have to make. \n\nWatch the movie Sophie's choice", "If I put myself in their shoes, what they probably heard you saying was basically \u2026 I know you guys love each other more than you love me, so just admit it!    If I were a parent, it\u2019d feel like a slap in the face.", "This is the kindest AITA. NTA. It would be an impossible choice now that he knows and loves you both, but in that moment so many years ago it makes sense to choose the women you love. It\u2019s a conversation I\u2019ve had with my husband and he says he would choose me. I think you could bring it back up to your parents and reassure them that they were wonderful parents and that if something that terrible ever happened back then all you meant is that they could make another baby to love and make a great life for because their love is so special.\n\nEdit to say NAH. I don\u2019t think anyone is the asshole in this situation. I didn\u2019t realize that was an option.", "NTA, expecting two people in love to choose a baby they haven\u2019t met over the other is kind of bullshit. It sounds like you are happy for their relationship and it doesn\u2019t come off that you meant it resentfully but they took it as such because, honestly, if it was back when you weren\u2019t born, he probably would have chosen your mom, just like you\u2019d probably choose your partner over a kid that is yet to be born.", "NTA - maybe they just feel a bit insecure in how they raised you, but if you have the self awareness to understand why a person might choose their partner over their unborn child (regardless of what you would chose yourself), and you can express it without any dismissive or angry undertones. Then they probably did a good job raising you.  \nMaybe they're taking this as \"she says we'd pick each other because she thinks we don't love her as much\". When in fact is more around the fact of how highly you view their relationship.", "NAH\n\nI almost became that child. The doctors thought I was dead inside my mom because they couldn't find a sign of life (early stage, I was very tiny, it was also the 80s so not so advanced technology). It was also the weekend and my mom's regular doctor wasn't there, just the emergency - and she didn't trust him. They wanted to get me out right away so my mom wouldn't be affected because they thought she could start bleeding etc. It was a high risk but my mom fought tooth and nail, swore to my dad that she could feel the baby was still alive, and to not have them do that (please don't ask me why my dad had the final say, again, it was the 80s, I have no clue).\n\nMy father trusted my mom - but he had to sign a form that stated that, should my mom die because of this, *he* would be responsible and would be sued for murder (or whatever the appropriate term is in English). My father signed it all, they went home and came back two days later to check. They had two doctors and three nurses monitor the ultrasound until finally one nurse found me! I wasn't dead, just very very lazily hanging out in just one corner of my mom's tummy \ud83d\ude05 (I'm still a lazy person, so that totally checks out).\n\nSo yeah, sometimes, parents do decide to risk their partner's life for the life of their unborn child. And once the kid is born, I think most parents will tell you the same: if it's between the child or the partner, they would always choose to save the child.\n\nThat is not to say that I think you did anything wrong! You voiced how you feel and that's totally fine.\n\nStill, I can understand that your parents are hurt - but I also don't think there's a simple solution. Try to talk to them again. It sounds like you all have a loving and trusting relationship, so ask them to sit down together and have a conversation. Explain your point of view and how you didn't mean it in a bad way. How your opinion wasn't reflecting on your relationship with them but how it was about their relationship to each other and how you admire that.\n\nIf after that it's still weird, then at one point sadly it's no longer your issue. Sometimes things hit people harder because it resonates to something they think or do or have done. It's completely their own responsibility to handle it then, not yours. I'm not saying that's the case, just that it is a possibility. \n\nTry talking, I hope it helps.\n\nAll the best to you and your parents \u2764", "But why did you have to say that? That was an unnecessary comment you made. What if and and if, are questions you will never get the answer to. They love you otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here now.", "NAH. Here's an explanation you can give:\n\n\"You two met, you grew to love each other, you support each other. In the scenario mentioned, I'd still be a baby. I would be an unknown. I may have grown into the same same person, maybe not. But in that case you wouldn't have each other. You would be able to have another child and raise them to be someone as proud as I am to be of who I am. And proud to be your child the same way I am. But in that scenario, you wouldn't have each other to lean on. It wouldn't be a zero sum game, win or lose. But you'd have each other. And any children that come after would be lucky enough to have both of you, the same way I am. That's what I meant\"\n\nI think they'll understand, if you put it in way like this or similar.", "YTA, not in a malicious way but that is an absolutely horrible thing to say. Anyone would interpret it as you telling your parents you didn't think they really loved you. And it's the exact kind of thing that would make a parent scared - the kind of thing that seems like you've been holding in for years and only now had the courage to say. It really is the kind of comment that can permanently damage a relationship.\n\nThis is why discussing those kinds of hypotheticals is a terrible idea, they're impossible and you're not *supposed* to know what you'd do. The emotional truth is that you love each other so much that it's impossible. You, based on what you said, think they love each other but not you. Of course they're wondering if they did something horrible along the way that they don't quite understand. They probably think you're trying to walk it back because it's awkward, not because you didn't mean it, and they're wondering where they went wrong.\n\nI'm going to take your word for it that you didn't do it maliciously, but probably there's nothing you can do specifically. Hopefully they realise they know you well enough that you didn't actually mean it and it just blows over. But man, what a horrible thing to say to someone, really misreads the emotional meaning of that kind of discussion.\n\nAre you sure you aren't actually subconsciously resentful of your upbringing in some way?", "You could stop borrowing trouble by being offended by hypothetical situations that didn\u2019t happen. \n\nI\u2019m gonna say NAH. I get you\u2019re upset, but it\u2019s super awesome to have parents who are still so in love.

Historically it was only ever really relevant when a baby got stuck and you had the choice of disassembling it to get it out before the mother went septic, or cutting open a nearly-dead woman in the hope the baby hadn't suffocated yet.

It's a fruitless and cruel question. They both deserve to live, but only the surgeon can make a clinical assessment about what the relative risks are, what equipment and skills they have available, and which patient is putting the other's life at risk. And usually an modern emergency C-section occurs because a health problem with either mother or baby is destabilising the health of the other and putting both at risk.

I wouldn't want to live my life knowing that it had come at the cost of my child's life. And I believe that he would feel the same if he knew it was between his life and our child's life.

Of course they are going to think you are questioning or commenting their parenting, because your comment easily insinuates that you feel as you they don\u2019t love you enough. Don\u2019t think about what you meant but think about how your words could be understood.\n\nWhat compelled you to make this comment in the first place? I only ask because I have a friend who would make comments from the left field like this. We always thought he was just a bit quirky, but later in he was diagnosed as being in the spectrum. Wait - I\u2019m not saying that you are on the spectrum, I\u2019m just saying that it turned out he was just missing a little bit of awareness on what makes for a \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018acceptable\u2019 conversation.\n\nIf things continue to be awkward, you just need to outline to them you totally didn\u2019t mean anything by it other than as a slightly unusual way of telling them that it was just you expressing how much they love each other.\n\nOn the other hand, you could always question yourself on why you made that comment. As in, some people say things like that because they subconsciously want to validate their worth.", "I get it OP. To me no one is an AH here. Maybe you could have put it differently, maybe you could have not said it at all, but hey this was a conversation and you shared your opinion. Conversations can't be smooth all the time, communication hiccups will happen. \n\nYour parents felt like your opinion  implied more than it did because it was unexpected to them. But in a way, that is what is expected of conversations: different people share different views, and we often realize this only when the topic comes up, because we mistakenly assume folks close to us think the same way we do. You should just clarify it with them. I wouldn't worry too much about it, this is normal and you didn't do any faux-pas from my perspective.", "Ugh, I have distant relatives in a situation like that, their mom is on assisted living, she is unconscious and doesn't respond but is technically alive. They said she wouldn't want to be in this state, that forcing fate isn't appropriate and the nurses got \"offended on their mother's behalf\" and guilt-tripped them. It's so painful for them to go to the hospital and see her in this state, and knowing she wouldn't have wanted it either.", "this is exactly what I think is being reflected about OP and their situation - something is wrong that OP hasn't shared in this post", "I want to see this bowling pin that has the words u/notthelizardgenitals engraved on it.", "Not a problem, but if you're new and lost, I thoroughly recommend looking at the FAQs, where there's a good explanation of the various judgement acronyms.", "Yeah, NAH, you put them in a slightly awkward spot, and you should generally avoid doing that, but no harm done.", "Gentle YTA   \n\n\nJust feels  like you are looking for a conflict.   \nDiscussing what a challenging  situation their friend was in and how hard it would be to experience is a much different sentiment than they wouldn't choose you. Stop looking for drama. Appreciate the amazing family dynamic you have. Most aren't so lucky to have such loving parents to each other and for their children.", "YTA to yourself for bringing up hypotheticals of such a serious nature. I'm not sure what type of response you expected or even why you'd introduce that scenario to them...especially to people who you describe as \"the best parents growing up and still are\"", "Your parents love you.  \n\nI love my husband and he loves me. But both of us would want to die for our children. If the house was on fire I want hubs to save our child and not me. He is the same.  It would be hard for either of us to let the other die but it would be what both of us wanted. \n\nYour mom and dad have an amazing relationship and it is an unusual one to be so much in love.  You should be so lucky someday.  But know that they love you and you are a culmination of a beautiful couple.", "NAH. You aren't a baby they've never known, you are a child whom they've raised and loved for years. They can't fathom the last 18 years without you, especially not while talking to you, the aforementioned child they love. It's just not the same scenario. Give it time and don't dwell, the tension will pass.", "I will not judge either way. This man was put in a real bad spot having to chose which life to save.    If you are feeling awkward,  go apologize for saying what you did.  Your parents have a loving relationship that's something to aspire to.  Maybe not even an apology but have a conversation to clear the air.", "NTA. You're an adult now, nothing wrong with honesty. It's pretty clear it doesn't bother you, so no hurt feelings. Maybe they're just uncomfortable admitting to that out loud because it may make them sound like jerks, who knows.", "NAH. It\u2019s okay to admit that you value your partner over a potential. It\u2019s easier to grieve with someone who can support you rather than a newborn. Parents hearing this may feel hurt because they do love their children and don\u2019t want their kids to feel unwanted. Communicating that is pretty key and understanding the hypothetical changes once a child is born", "NAH and you could even show them this post and explain their love story has set you up for great standards for your future partners for a healthy relationship.", "Ask stupid questions, get, stupid answers.", "YTA. You're projecting your insecurity on your parents. They aren't lying to you - *you* are the only person who thinks they wouldn't choose you. \n\nYou need therapy.", "NAH, but you need to apologize to your parents for creating the concern.\n\nYou know that they have an amazing love for each other; you don't know that - despite their great love - they would have not chosen to save you. You leaped too far in your assumption.\n\nJust tell your parents that you do feel loved. You were so focused on what an amazing love they share, that you made an assumption that nothing would come before each other. You were wrong to assume that because you've never felt uncared for or unloved. Tell them that you love how much they love each other. You are so sorry that you caused them any pain or doubt about how well they have loved you. Tell them how much it hurts you that you hurt them and that you hope they will forget your poorly worded statement.\n\nI know that's a lot of apologizing. It's not that you had one bad thought in your head, but your words sure made it seem that you felt less-than with them.\n\nI hope that a good conversation with them is followed by a lot of hugging between you all.", "YTA in this situation. Your father had never met you, but he had loved your mother for years when you were born. I wouldn't doubt that a lot of fathers would want to pick their wives while the mothers would pick the baby they had been carrying for months over their own lives. It's all hypothetical though and no one really wins by guessing and no one truly knows until they are in that situation.", "YTA in this situation.

I could totally use the vacation, and I love naps :p", "OP sounds like a fairly thoughtful and self reflective young person. They\u2019re realizing that the impact of the words didn\u2019t match their intent. \n\nI think you\u2019re being a bit harsh in your judgement of them. Everyone has made a comment they didn\u2019t realize the impact of until it was said.

I'm also responding to the part of their comment which I quoted, which betrayed a lack of acknowledgment, at least fully, of what they did wrong. \n\nIt's not the big of a deal, OP is still a teenage, and no doubt it will blow over, but OP's comment says they still don't fully understand why they're in the wrong here.", "One tiny thing, it just counts the first one said in the comment so you\u2019d need to put your edit at the top!

Just apologize and move on, we all put our foot in our mouths sometimes", "YTA. You made that completely about you. You made it tense.", "NAH. Let it go and make it clear as things go on that you love and appreciate them both. \n\nI have this kind of relationship with my husband, and I can easily imagine my son saying this. It would be a shock, so I understand their reaction, but as long as everything is fine between you, they should be reassured.", "when i was a kid i used to torture myself with hypothetically having to choose whether my mom or my cat could live.  why ?  i needed to make myself feel awful about losing my poor cat because i loved him so much\u2026 i needed that stupid torture in my life for some reason ? why ?", "OP didn't ask the question though.", "I can see a soft AH judgment if they keep making this innocent and well-intentioned comment by their loving child a big deal. But right now I agree it\u2019s an NAH.", "I mean it wasn\u2019t well-intentioned nor innocent? It was a comment that essentially called her parents liars, after they said \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nWith her response of \u201cyeah you do, you would\u2019ve saved her.\u201d", "People sometimes tell white lies to be polite or kind.

It would not have mattered for me had my parents gotten an abortion or had I died at birth. Why? Because I wouldn't have lived /lived long enough for anything to matter to me. \n\nI am happy though that I am alive. \n\nAnd present me would feel sad for my parents to have to go through that.", "I really disagree. This is just being truthful about the reality that existed then. It\u2019s a cognitive trap to think that recognising this is devaluing the person you are today and what you have come to mean to your parents *through the life you have lived together*. None of that existed at the earlier point in time.", "Who raised the hypothetical in the first place?", "No, what she said implied, at most, that they loved each other more than they loved the as-yet unborn child she was at the time of the hypothetical scenario.\n\nI think what we have here is a genuine difference in perspective. The thread is split between people who think \u201cduh, why would you care more about a potential life than one who\u2019s already here\u201d and those who think that rejecting that potential life necessarily means rejecting the person who has now become actual.\n\nMy takeaway is that OP\u2019s feelings and her parents\u2019 are both reasonable and they (and we) should recognise the validity of both responses, and that they both come from a place of\nlove, rather than dismissing one as tactless and wrong.", "Always remember that you matter more than all the infinite \"What If\" questions - they are hypothetical - You are Real!", "My point is that it's a tactless and dumb thing to say regardless.

Are you sure you don't inflict torture to yourself today? \n\nSorry, doing some chair therapy ( not sure if this is the correct expression). I remember crying desperately for accidentally breaking my grandma's beautiful lamp cover..while I don't remember her reaction at all, which tells me she didn't show me she minded. I can still see the lamp rolling, first up on the couch ( relief), and then on the hard pavement.. disaster..", "I think this is a newer thing to not ask tbh?

Do you get that?\n\n[ETA: Not the commentator you replied to, but I think I and they are on the same page.]", "I\u2019m not suggesting all thoughts should be voiced, but the degree to which we should suppress them very much depends on the relationship we have with the person we\u2019re speaking to and what their values are. OP may have made the wrong call as to how much honesty as to troublesome thoughts her parents were comfortable with, and whether they\u2019d be on the same page as her on the connection between potential and actual lives, but it was not inherently a \u201cdumb and tactless\u201d thing to say. There are parental relationships in which this would have been absolutely fine."]}
