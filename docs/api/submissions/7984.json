When my mom was 15, she had this huge crush on my father, she said he was the most handsome guy she had ever seen, he had no idea who she was tho. Three years later they randomly met at an event, my dad asked her out that night and they have been inseparable ever since. \n\nThey were the best parents growing up and still are. I don't have a single memory of them fighting or yelling at eachother and if they did, I never heard them. My dad still gets my mom flowers every week, moved across the country cuz she got a big job opportunity (he loved his hometown), and for about 1-2 years my mom was the earner of the family, supporting my dad who left a job he hated and helping him start his own business. I do believe that they are the definition of soulmates.\n\nNow to the problem. \n\nA few days ago, my parents were talking about a close family friend who had an emergency C-section and how the father had to pick the one who gets saved (both the mother and the baby are fine btw). My dad was saying how lucky they were that my mom's pregnancy and labor went smoothly, and that he could never choose between me and my mother. My mom agreed, saying that she wouldn't be able to pick either. \n\nWell, I intervened and said that it's fine to admit that they would choose eachother instead of me if it came down to it. My parents completly froze. They started asking if they did anything wrong, if I didn't feel loved anymore and how I could think about something like that. \n\nI apologised, told them I didn't mean it that way. But now things are still tense between us and I'm afraid that they might feel as if they are bad parents. But I only said it because I know how much they love eachother and that one couldn't live if something happend to the other.\n\nSo AITA?

A good rule of thumb is don't engage in hypotheticals. Life has enough tough decisions to make without engaging in ones that don't apply to you.", "NAH as you probably didn't think how those words may sounds like until you said it out loud. \n\nOn the side note: I envy you so much", "NAH - hopefully no one will be in this position again, but nothing wrong for you to say what you did. It doesn't matter what your parents would have done at birth. It doesn't change the fact they were good parents to you, and that today they'll most probably give their life to save you. Hopefully again, you'll never know that for sure though!", "NAH.  Some discussions are best not had. That's a choice no one should ever have to make. \n\nWatch the movie Sophie's choice", "If I put myself in their shoes, what they probably heard you saying was basically \u2026 I know you guys love each other more than you love me, so just admit it!    If I were a parent, it\u2019d feel like a slap in the face.", "This is the kindest AITA. NTA. It would be an impossible choice now that he knows and loves you both, but in that moment so many years ago it makes sense to choose the women you love. It\u2019s a conversation I\u2019ve had with my husband and he says he would choose me. I think you could bring it back up to your parents and reassure them that they were wonderful parents and that if something that terrible ever happened back then all you meant is that they could make another baby to love and make a great life for because their love is so special.", "NTA, expecting two people in love to choose a baby they haven\u2019t met over the other is kind of bullshit. It sounds like you are happy for their relationship and it doesn\u2019t come off that you meant it resentfully but they took it as such because, honestly, if it was back when you weren\u2019t born, he probably would have chosen your mom, just like you\u2019d probably choose your partner over a kid that is yet to be born.", "NTA - maybe they just feel a bit insecure in how they raised you, but if you have the self awareness to understand why a person might choose their partner over their unborn child (regardless of what you would chose yourself), and you can express it without any dismissive or angry undertones. Then they probably did a good job raising you.  \nMaybe they're taking this as \"she says we'd pick each other because she thinks we don't love her as much\". When in fact is more around the fact of how highly you view their relationship.", "NAH\n\nI almost became that child. The doctors thought I was dead inside my mom because they couldn't find a sign of life (early stage, I was very tiny, it was also the 80s so not so advanced technology). It was also the weekend and my mom's regular doctor wasn't there, just the emergency - and she didn't trust him. They wanted to get me out right away so my mom wouldn't be affected because they thought she could start bleeding etc. It was a high risk but my mom fought tooth and nail, swore to my dad that she could feel the baby was still alive, and to not have them do that (please don't ask me why my dad had the final say, again, it was the 80s, I have no clue).\n\nMy father trusted my mom - but he had to sign a form that stated that, should my mom die because of this, *he* would be responsible and would be sued for murder (or whatever the appropriate term is in English). My father signed it all, they went home and came back two days later to check. They had two doctors and three nurses monitor the ultrasound until finally one nurse found me! I wasn't dead, just very very lazily hanging out in just one corner of my mom's tummy \ud83d\ude05 (I'm still a lazy person, so that totally checks out).\n\nSo yeah, sometimes, parents do decide to risk their partner's life for the life of their unborn child. And once the kid is born, I think most parents will tell you the same: if it's between the child or the partner, they would always choose to save the child.\n\nThat is not to say that I think you did anything wrong! You voiced how you feel and that's totally fine.\n\nStill, I can understand that your parents are hurt - but I also don't think there's a simple solution. Try to talk to them again. It sounds like you all have a loving and trusting relationship, so ask them to sit down together and have a conversation. Explain your point of view and how you didn't mean it in a bad way. How your opinion wasn't reflecting on your relationship with them but how it was about their relationship to each other and how you admire that.\n\nIf after that it's still weird, then at one point sadly it's no longer your issue. Sometimes things hit people harder because it resonates to something they think or do or have done. It's completely their own responsibility to handle it then, not yours. I'm not saying that's the case, just that it is a possibility. \n\nTry talking, I hope it helps.\n\nAll the best to you and your parents \u2764", "But why did you have to say that? That was an unnecessary comment you made. What if and and if, are questions you will never get the answer to. They love you otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be here now.", "NAH. Here's an explanation you can give:\n\n\"You two met, you grew to love each other, you support each other. In the scenario mentioned, I'd still be a baby. I would be an unknown. I may have grown into the same same person, maybe not. But in that case you wouldn't have each other. You would be able to have another child and raise them to be someone as proud as I am to be of who I am. And proud to be your child the same way I am. But in that scenario, you wouldn't have each other to lean on. It wouldn't be a zero sum game, win or lose. But you'd have each other. And any children that come after would be lucky enough to have both of you, the same way I am. That's what I meant\"\n\nI think they'll understand, if you put it in way like this or similar.", "YTA, not in a malicious way but that is an absolutely horrible thing to say. Anyone would interpret it as you telling your parents you didn't think they really loved you. And it's the exact kind of thing that would make a parent scared - the kind of thing that seems like you've been holding in for years and only now had the courage to say. It really is the kind of comment that can permanently damage a relationship.\n\nThis is why discussing those kinds of hypotheticals is a terrible idea, they're impossible and you're not *supposed* to know what you'd do. The emotional truth is that you love each other so much that it's impossible. You, based on what you said, think they love each other but not you. Of course they're wondering if they did something horrible along the way that they don't quite understand. They probably think you're trying to walk it back because it's awkward, not because you didn't mean it, and they're wondering where they went wrong.\n\nI'm going to take your word for it that you didn't do it maliciously, but probably there's nothing you can do specifically. Hopefully they realise they know you well enough that you didn't actually mean it and it just blows over. But man, what a horrible thing to say to someone, really misreads the emotional meaning of that kind of discussion.\n\nAre you sure you aren't actually subconsciously resentful of your upbringing in some way?", "You could stop borrowing trouble by being offended by hypothetical situations that didn\u2019t happen. \n\nI\u2019m gonna say NAH. I get you\u2019re upset, but it\u2019s super awesome to have parents who are still so in love. My own are the same and it\u2019s so heartwarming to see.", "YTA, it was an innocent comment, but you are 18 years old, how could you not think that it implied that they did not love you enough", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
