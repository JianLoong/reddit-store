I was super sick for months because I had caught whooping cough from my niece and it messed me up. I would get super sick during class sometimes. I got a bloody nose which made me need to throw up and I was running down the hallways bleeding a puking trying to find an open bathroom on the floor. They had also taken ash the trash cans out of the halls for some reason too. I finally just ran down to the nurses office, then and office person tried to come tell me I needed to clean up the puke and blood on the second floor and I lost my mind screaming at them that if all the fucking bathrooms upstairs weren\u2019t locked this would not have happened and no  way I\u2019m cleaning up. This was like a brand new school, second year it was opened and no one ever understood why this was happening. But after that there was at least Two bathrooms unlocked upstairs. That school has so many weird power tripping rules that students had to deal with to get rid of.", "That's really bad of the school. I personally believe that the bathrooms should always be unlocked and available to students at anytime, solely because you never know when someone is going to need it for any reason. A female student might get her period, little Tommy may have eaten something bad at breakfast and he only just now is feeling sick, and I myself have days where I just need to pee frequently. As a teacher, even I've had to bolt out of the classroom, mid class, to use the bathroom.  \n\n\nI hope the people who locked the bathrooms at your school were the ones who had to clean it up.   \nAnd I had a power-tripping principal in high school too. I think I broke every one of his rules at least once. He was particularly targeting male students with his rules, and hated I wouldn't conform to his rules. I remember he'd call my dad often, and my dad would just laugh at him over the phone, cause even my dad thought his rules were over the top and stupid. xD", "NTA, just give a graphic description about how you\u2019re bleeding through your pants or something (even if you aren\u2019t)", "nta. I had an hour a half long classes and often had to get up to go to the bathroom due to my diabetes. I would have flared at my professor for this rule", "NTA you are a adult.. He can't legally prevent you from going to the restroom.  Sorry but not sorry ,  Next time teacher comes at you like that I'd give a passive  aggressive comment  like Well , Where do you want me to squat? You won't  mind if I do.. I will provide  news paper ..  I promise to clean it up..  Or should I go in a bucket?? Nothing to see here I am handing my business..", "Prof is right, that is incredibly distracting. For him to interrupt the entire class like that? I'd have trouble focusing after my prof did that, too.  \n\n\nNTA. You're an adult, use the bathroom if you need the bathroom", "NTA. Its sad to see that this crap goes on at all levels of educational facilities. I remember my math teacher in 9th grade refusing to let me go until I informed him that I guess I'd just have to bleed on everything. Shouldn't be like that.", "Tell him you have a UTI every time you go to the bathroom, then when he says no ask him \u201cI\u2019m sorry, are you asking me to ignore a medical condition rn\u201d\n\nHonestly any \u201cgirl problem\u201d health issues should be enough to get him to calm down, and you can report him if he says no.", "NTA. That's a ridiculous rule to apply to adults. If he's so \"disrupted\" by someone quietly leaving the room and returning that's his problem. Unless the bathroom is right next to the room and everyone can hear every plop, stream, and flush, in which case the solution is STILL not to say you can't use the bathroom, but to do something about the sounds. Does this professor know that there are people with bathroom-related medical conditions?", "NTA You\u2019re paying for school, so you should be able to go to the bathroom when you want.", "NTA.  Tell him you have your period or a UTI.  Go to the dean about this.  It's ridiculous.", "NTA. He should not be distracted by other people's bladder and bowels.", "NTA you could actually probably take him to the Office of Equal Opportunity.  No one is allowed to control bodily functions.", "Unpopular opinion I guess but ESH\n\nYour prof probably shouldn't have it as a rule and have called you out on it, but they established the rule from the start so it's not a surprise. Do other students have this issue and were they called out? \n\nMaybe the prof is easily distracted and your getting up distracts them from their lecture which is disruptive to everyone (except you, because you're distracted by leaving/returning), and then if you're the kind of person who's calling out how much tuition is, I wonder if you're also the kind of person who goes up after class/office hours to ask the prof to explain the part you missed.\n\nYou should plan better or find an accommodation if you need for medical reasons. An hour and 15 is not long.", "ESH. I don't deny that the professor sounds like a prick, but you're making a *much* bigger deal of this than it needs to be. You knew from Day 1 this rule was in place, and if you have a documented medical condition requiring you to go to the bathroom the moment nature calls, that could have been discussed with him privately. Otherwise, what's stopping you from going before/after class? Especially since it's late November and the semester will be over in a couple weeks anyway; just finish out it out and make sure never to sign up for any other classes of his in the future. What makes me particularly cynical about this post is that you felt the need to state that you're attending a private college costing $50,000 a semester, which has nothing to do with the issue at hand but suggests that you're a spoiled rich girl not used to hearing \"No.\"", "I had this happen when i was 25 and doing my master's. A particularly shitty guest lecturer called me out for standing up to go to the bathroom, asking where i was going. I said \"to the bathroom\". He said \"no, you can wait\". \n\nNo, I can't. I'm a woman with kidney issues that NEEDS to go when i need to go. I was mortified. Went anyway. Also, I'm a fucking adult. You don't get to decide when i can and cannot go to the bathroom.", "I mean I need this class to graduate so I didn\u2019t have the choice to drop it, especially not bc the rule sucks. I never ask the professor to explain parts I missed, if I want to know I ask someone else from class after class is over. I went before class too, but I had diarrhea that day (sorry TMI but it\u2019s relevant) so I had to go again. I normally don\u2019t use the bathroom during class", "Lol weird to assume that off of one sentence. Not that it\u2019s your business, but despite my family being rich, I was not spoiled. My dad has abused me my entire life. So yeah, I\u2019m used to hearing no. Check yourself before you decide you know everything about someone", "You can state the cost of a credit hour to go there. He is employed by your money there to serve you by teaching.  Without students he doesn't have a job. The amount of disrespect there is astounding.", "I\u2019m old now so this was in 2002. It was a brand new school and we went through a new principal every year I was there. There was definitely problems going on. I was always a straight a student and never got in trouble but seemed to just have so many issues with admin for no reason. Dress code, issues with all my doctors appts etc even though I was still straight a. It was the most bizarre school experience but I Def think any teacher it school that limits bathroom stuff is in the wind and it drives me nuts that it still happens!", "Nope NTA I have IBS issues and it can hit at anytime. So if I have to go than I have to go. You are paying for the tuition and as long as you are not disruptive to the entire class than I do not see the issue.", "NTA. You pay him to teach you.

You're and adult and it's a basic human right. If he calls you put again, ask him if why he doesn't believe in human rights as he's denying the most basic to you.  I believe it's against the law.", "NTA. What a stupid and inappropriate rule.", "Say you got a health condition NTA", "NTA\n\nIf someone really need to use the bathroom for good reasons as needing to go to the bathroom to pee or to poop because you can feel that you had those or cannot take it longer and needing to change napkins then they are allowed to and no one should force them to stay. When someone really needs go to the bathroom but the teachers didnt allow it then it can cause harm like UTI especially if this happens everyday", "The tuition part is irrelevant.\n\nYour professor is not a bladder god. That's what is relevant. I'm assuming that you don't behave like a 12-year-old kid and make detailed announcements about what you think you'll produce, so NTA.\n\nEdited to add: OTOH, if professor insists on making a scene, it would make sense to add those details so you can demonstrate what \"distracting\" looks like.", "I'm a professor and this dude sucks. NTA. (Also, please go to the bathroom, because having an Incident in my classroom is way more distracting.)\n\nFor real though, bathroom access is a accessibility  issue, lots of students have IBS or period diarrhea or none of my business, and not allowing a student to take a class because of their medical need to use the bathroom is pretty illegal. I'd bring this to the attention of your university disability services office.", "[removed]", "NTA Take that issue to admin as it's bloody stupid one to have, it's an evening class which means all present are adults.

Courteously explain that you will of course try to go to the bathroom before or after class, but if there is an urgent situation, you will unobtrusively step out, and you appreciate your professor's understanding in this matter. \n\nThe reason you should contact your professor first is, if you go higher up the chain, the very first thing they will say is \"Have you talked to your professor about this?\" If the answer is no, they'll tell you to talk to the professor  first.", "Abused or not, you still sound like an entitled brat. When you ask people for their opinions, don't get pissy when they don't tell you what you want to hear.", "Adding on to this great take: email to clarify the rule.

Last Monday, I was surprised when you stopped the class to reiterate your stance that quietly using the restroom is disruptive.
