The mood was light, everyone was happy.\nWhen I was done, I said, \"Okay, ladies, it's time to roll. Mom, you're sitting in the front.\"\n\nMy wife said, \"Wait, what? I thought I was sitting in front.\" \n\nI said, \"What? Why? No, Mom is sitting in the front seat, so her and I can catch up. You know traffic going from the airport is crazy and I don't want to have to crane my head to the back while I'm talking with my mom.\"\n\nShe said, \"Yeah, but you didn't even check in me with or anything. You just made that decision up on the spot.\"\n\nThen my mom tried to diffuse the situation by saying, \"Oh it's okay, I'll sit in the back, it's no bother, really\" and then I got irritated because my wife had brought this unnecessary, negative energy out of nowhere and, instead of us being on the road already, we were having a conversation about who sat in the front seat. Childish.\n\nAnd I said it, too. I said, \"This is childish. Mom get in the front seat. Babe get in the back. This is not up for discussion.\" \n\nThey got in the car and my wife was silent the whole trip while my mom and I caught up. We dropped my mom off at my sister's house, and then headed home. My wife asked sarcastically, \"Can I sit in the front seat now?\" I ignored her and she called her friends and asked them if their husbands ever made them sit in the backseat while letting their mom in front, and apparently not.\n\nI don't see what the big problem is, but my wife is still upset and says she's not talking to me until I apologize for \"ordering\" her to sit in the backseat. I said no, I'm not apologizing. I told her to go calm down and then we can talk about it later, but I wanted to get some opinions to know if I should stand my ground or if she has a point. I think this whole thing is ridiculous, honestly, but better to set the boundary now before it gets worse, I suppose.\n\n*Edit*: From reading the comments, I can see a lot of people are just reading the words I said without taking into account the tone I used.
