Friends and I told her she should cut that ish quick because it's toxic and not child appropriate and she laughed it off saying it's not a big deal. Fast forward 8 months and she calls us crying because she has a black eye from being backhanded over some alpha male BS. Her hubs turned into a completely different person and present day her kid won't listen to her and his female teachers are having issues getting him to obey the rules in class. She's now working two jobs, still has to come home and clean and cook everything while her hubs goes and has beers with the \"bros\" and her kid won't even tell her he loves her anymore (much less listen to her) and she's miserable.  \n\nIt may start off as something you roll your eyes at, but it escalates quickly. Stay away from anyone that's willing to be sucked into that mentality. It's not worth it."]}
