The fact that the feared harm comes from family doesn't matter.  The child's mental and emotional health are FAR  more important than a rude man getting to see his grandchild.\n\n**NTA**\n\nEDIT: I would like to add something from personal experience that is very similar.  My paternal grandmother is 100% Japanese, and came from a traditional Japanese home.  Paternal grandfather was a white man in the air force.  They met while he was in Japan during WW2.  He was NEVER accepted by her family, as he was a \"foreigner\".  Her father essentially disowned her when they were married.  That all changed when my father was born.  The man who initially hated foreigners changed his mind the moment he saw his helpless baby grandson.  We now have a pretty good relationship with that entire side of the family.\n\nThis doesn't guarantee he will be respectful around your family, but just shows that anyone can change their stance when a helpless child is brought into the picture.  It's hard to hate an innocent baby.", "Hmm soft NTA. Tell his mom she raised a racist. \n\nHowever I would also consider allowing him to visit her in a public place. Have someone with you.

But to play devil's advocate, perhaps meeting the baby is a step in the right direction for your father to put his racist views in the past and turn a new leaf towards compassion for your husband and others that he has prejudices towards? If you eventually decide to let your father meet or have a relationship with your child, I would have the first interaction be at a neutral location. That way if things go south (your Dad keeps with his views) then you can simply get up and walk away from the situation without having to remember not only the opportunity you presented that didn't go well, but also the location won't bring up bad memories. As opposed to meeting at your parents or your own place and having to remember that meeting each time you are in that setting.\n\n\nBest of luck to you, OP.

You want his heart to melt, you don't want his ill will on the baby. And there is a perfectly non-spiritual explanation for the Evil Eye, too: if you sense his ill will, it will stress you, and your child will sense it, and that could cause some harm.\n\nAnd while it's not unknown for racist grandparents to have a change of heart, from what you have posted, you have no indication that your father's heart has softened, you haven't had the kind of interaction with him that shows you that he has had a change of heart, or ~~any investigation to find out~~ \\[edit: a bit of an assumption, I find your follow up comment about your extended family's statements worrying on this score\\]. So you are well within your good judgment to think it is a very, very bad idea for him to meet your child. Your nuclear family's needs come before your extended family's needs.", "NTA.
