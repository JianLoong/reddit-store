My paternal grandmother is 100% Japanese, and came from a traditional Japanese home.  Paternal grandfather was a white man in the air force.  They met while he was in Japan during WW2.  He was NEVER accepted by her family, as he was a \"foreigner\".  Her father essentially disowned her when they were married.  That all changed when my father was born.  The man who initially hated foreigners changed his mind the moment he saw his helpless baby grandson.

If you eventually decide to let your father meet or have a relationship with your child, I would have the first interaction be at a neutral location. That way if things go south (your Dad keeps with his views) then you can simply get up and walk away from the situation without having to remember not only the opportunity you presented that didn't go well, but also the location won't bring up bad memories.

He doesn't deserve what you made because he didn't support you when you made a choice. Let the racism (which is a bullshit term, there is only one race, the human one. Doesn't matter color or culture)die.  anyone who can't get over that doesn't deserve to be part of your life. Go and be happy.", "NTA but this one\u2019s tough, think you should leave the door cracked open in case you feel it would be acceptable to invite him in the future. It wouldn\u2019t be a no forever for me but if you\u2019re not comfortable / don\u2019t feel any guilt then by all means keep him away.", "NTA\n\nTell your Grandmother to push daisies and your Father to kick rocks.", "NTA!!!! You are protecting your daughter from a racist. You aren\u2019t being disrespectful.", "NTA. Your father and his family are disgusting, thinking they can say awful things to you, then turn around and have \"the right\" to meet your daughter.\n\nStick to your guns on this.", "Nta. You are a good mom. Keep that baby safe from those hateful people. Block numbers. Life will be better. Smooch the baby.", "NTA. Racism is learned. Ask your grandmother where your father learned it.", "NTA, especially if there's nothing to suggest he's doing anything to change", "NTA. BASed on what you say, it doesn't sound as though your father has acknowledged or apologised for his racist behaviour, or done anything to suggest that he would be willing to treat your husband and child with respect.\n\nYour baby may be too young to notice know, but pretty soon she is goings to start to understand what people say and why would you willingly expose her to that kind of toxic behaviour?\n\nYou aren't a kid. You a grown woman with a husband and a child, and your priority should, entirely appropriately , be the family that you love and that loves you , and treats you with respect.\n\nIn the event your dad treats you, your husband, and your child with respect, he can start earning your respect, and maybe you will feel willing to give him another chance. \n\nALso, you haven't mentioned your husband's views, but this is his child as well, and he presumably has a lot more experience of being on the receiving end of racism than you do - any decision should be a joint one, but honestly, your father doesn't respect you, your husband, or your marriage, and made clear he didn't want a grandchild who wasn't white. WHAt has changed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don't have to respond a at all but if you want to, say to your grandmother or others having a go \"He's chosen to destroy any respect I had for him by his own racist  behaviour and lack or respect for me, my husband and our family. He's chosen to cut himself off from us, I've accepted that choice on his part. \"", "NTA - don't let that into your daughters life", "No.\n\nYou are saving ypur daughter from being traumatized by her grandfather and his relatives because they don't like the ***color*** of her skin.\n\nThey will BLINDED by that so much they will not be able to see the amazing beautiful person she will grow to be.\n\nThat will be their loss. Not yours. Theirs. As it should be.\n\nProtect your daughter by any means necessary MAMA BEAR.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Tell your grandmother that your father lost the right to your respect as soon as he made it clear he wouldn't respect a mixed race granddaughter.", "Hell no your NTA, I don't like pulling the NC card but you should have been cut the cord with this man and his family. Why is he all of a sudden so interested in a child he stated shouldn't exist? I wouldn't trust him with a stuffed animal let alone a whole child.", "ESH  \n\n\nI had family members in exactly your position.   \n\n\nThe grandfather DID meet the granddaughter - and he loves her. As a result he was forced to face his dumbass racist views head on. He genuinely loves that kid now and is a better person for it.\n\nLet him meet her now while she's too young to internalize any dumb shit he says and then if he's able to change great, if not, your kiddo will be no more worse for wear.   \n\n\nDefinitely tell him upfront that NO disrespect will be tolerated and set up some ground rules. If he doesn't comply, it's over. How else do any of you expect racism to end?", "It depends on whether he has apologized for his prior behavior, which was terrible, and on whether your husband is OK with it.  If you think he's sincerely turned over a new leaf, and your husband is OK with it, then I would be in favor of giving him another chance.", "NTA but if he is asking, it is possible he might have changed or be changing. I say this because I experienced it. My fundamentalist \"Christian\" father told me if I brought my first Black bf on his property, he'd shoot him. 5 years later, while dating a different Black man, I had a child and was certain I'd be disowned. But my dad said he wanted to see my baby and I took the chance and went. He never treated my son any differently than any of his other grandkids and died when my son was just 3. I'm glad I allowed my son to know his grandfather - just like all the other grandkids. Only you can make this decision.", "Yup. This warrants full NC I\u2019m afraid. You have a family to protect OP.", "they are used to getting respect automatically.", "Totally NTA....although this may be the catalyst needed for op's sperm donor (cant really call him dad) to see how wrong he is....but unless OP was sure he wouldnt be a racist prick to her daughter. She is totally absolutley right to deny him contact", "This \\^\\^\\^\\^ is what you should tell your dad.", "The one thing that makes me feel guilty is that I\u2019ve seen tons of situations exactly like this and then once the racist dad meets the mixed grandchild, he loves them and changes his ways. But even if he did somehow change, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s already bern racist all his life and can\u2019t take any of that back.", " Never reward a bully by giving them what they want.", "Well, it's not your child's job to fix him with her presence, possibly at the expense of her own mental health. Even if he does love her, it's quite likely that he would expose her to subtle microaggressions that would undermine her self-esteem. I think you're very much justified in protecting her from him.", "TBH, if you are inclined to ever let him meet her, in the hopes that he might change, I would think that sooner would be better than later. Right now, she won't be able to understand or remember if he says something racist to or about her or her father or paternal family; in a few years, she will.\n\nTo be clear, I am *absolutely not* saying that I think you *should* let him meet her. I'm just saying that, if you think there's a chance you will ever want to, now might be the better time.   Because I totally understand that you wish he could be a better man than he has been, and I worry that your hope might lead you to yield in time, and I would hate for you to give him that chance only to have him say something racist that she remembers and internalizes. But if you decide he should never meet her, you are absolutely NTA for that.", "He's never apologized for anything he's said before has he? Shown any indication that he's interested or capable of that change? \n\nYou're protecting your daughter from someone who is so hateful they didn't want her to exist. Please keep protecting her. His potential change of hear tis not more important than her well-being.", "Your daughter is not a teaching tool for old white supremacists.", "That's all true. And it's possible that when he sees her he will love her and realize what an asshole he's been. Or he might continue to be an racist idiot. But if he changes, I don't see what the gain is to punish him for past behavior. What does your husband think?", "It's cause the stories where the grandparents double down and then later the kid and grandpa cut ties, but not before the kid feels horrible their whole life aren't as much fun to talk about.\n\n\nAnd really. All it would mean is your daughter is an exception. Not changing anything about his past behaviors or making amends. What about her friends? Her future relationships?", "So your family is racist and sexist. They're all AHs. Protect your family, NTA.", "She's posting here because obviously she's conflicted. I do agree that he needs to make amends with her and her husband before he can even think about having a relationship with their children. I'm not defending him, but I am saying is that without a chance, there is no change.", "How can there be change without the opportunity to change? I don't disagree that his racism is far uncalled for.\n\nReally he needs to repair the relationship with the father first. Accept all of my family, or you don't get to be apart of it.", ">I would hate for you to give him that chance only to have him say something racist that she remembers and internalizes.\n\n  \nRight, he could become a \"You're one of the *good* ones!\" kind of racist, and instill in her that type of stealth self-hatred.", "My mother absolutely hates my father (they\u2019re divorced). She has completely different views than him and knows all about the situation. She thinks it\u2019s better if I keep him away from my husband and daughter. Even as a teenager I tried to cut him out of my life but he always somehow gets back in.", "The sexism worries me as well. As a kid my father always favored my brother over me and make me do all the household chores because it\u2019s \u201ca woman\u2019s job\u201d in his opinion. I don\u2019t want my daughter to have to deal with that too on top of the racism.", "Dad had plenty of chances to change in the past. After all of the comments, OP still invited her father to her wedding and dad didn't come and didn't reach out and it doesn't sound like he has even apologized.\n\nIF OP is willing to have a relationship w/ her father, he has to, at a minimum, apologize to both her and her husband and show he has respect for her decision to stay away from him. Instead he telles her it is his right to see her child and sic's granny after her w/ the same message. OP doesn't have to do anything to repair the relationship.\n\nI'm sorry, but there is a boundry of hurt you cross that can't be repaired. \"You will poision my bloodline\" is a completly reasonable line to draw in the sand and say \"never again\". Even if dad \"learns\", it isn't OP's job to risk her family's mental health to have to put up w/ him b/c there is absolutely no way he goes from \"poison my bloodline\" to \"black lives matter\". I'm sure OP doesn't want risk in 5 years her dad yelling at her child at a picnic to get out of the sun so their skin doesn't get any darker or telling the child they should tame their messy hair/how attractive they would look with straight hair.", "I figured your parents were divorced and that works in your favor if you at least have one parent on your side. I'd confide in your husband and mother about this but, yeah yout mother's right. Also I think you, your daughter and husband would have very little to gain and more to lose from letting your father and his side of the family be in your daughter's life.\n\nCongrats on the kid!", "Your daughter will have to deal with racism her whole life. She doesn't deserve to have her first experience with it come from people who should love her. Cut them all off. Protect that baby."]}
