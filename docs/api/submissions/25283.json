So i offered to buy the house from them, i have a fairly high paying job for my area and because i had been living there rent free while taking care of them i had quite a large saving, originally i told her i would just give her the money or help her out but she didnt want charity so she and my grandpa sold me the house for $90,000 (roughly 10% of the properties value) and i would let her live there until she died (which of course i would) because they knew i would keep the house in the family and most of my Uncles and my mom just wanted to sell it for a quick buck (only 1 uncle, josh, knew about them selling me the house and didnt mind at all because me and him had almost exclusively done all the maintenance or house work on it for years). \n\nUnfortunately my grandpa died in april 2021, and after that my grandma\u2019s youngest sister moved in to spend time with her because they were both widows and could emotionally support each other, so i took advantage of the covid interest rates and bought another house about 10 mins away so i could still be close by if she needed anything but have my own freedoms.

Every day. Your grandma selling you the house for 10% of its value is your reward for the years of hard work and sacrifice. No one else could be bothered to help. With 8 children, they could have all split the work and done just a bit of it, but it sounds like only one Uncle even pitched it and he was completely okay with the situation. \n\nYour grandma wanted the house to stay in the family. By selling it to you, she got what she wanted. You are NTA.", "NTA.  They chose to sell the house to you, I assume you didn't coerce them into selling or the price.  It is legally yours now, not much they can do.  You may want to consult with an attorney to be safe.", "NTA - the inheritance came from the money you used to buy the house. If it was such a big family hub, they should be happy to keep it in the family instead of selling it for a buck", "NTA you took care of your grandparents with no expectation of benefiting. Your grandmother made you a deal and you took it. Tough for the rest of the family.", "NTA.  They aren\u2019t entitled to your grandparents assets.

For taking care of your grandparents when they wouldn\u2019t step up?", "NTA, your grandparents legaly sold you the house, so it is yours.....", "NTA.  \nDont give them anything. No promises, no money.", "NTA - As long as your Grandmother was of sound mind when she sold you the house, you're good.  This is what happen when people assume they will just get a share of that isn't theirs to begin with.  They all had the opportunity to find out what Grandmother was planning to do with the house and didn't ask.  Must suck to be them.", "Where were they when your grandparents needed their kids assistance?\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nBut I\u2019m surprised you can buy a house for 10% of the value.

The house was already sold in a deal between you and your gp. Your aunts and uncles are entitled to absolutely nothing. What, exactly, are they going to sue for?", "INFO: Why would your grandma not be able to afford the house if it's already fully paid for, and how did paying them a scant 10% of the house's value alleviate this financial concern?", "Nta but your family is.  You were a wonderful person and grandchild.  I am sure your grandparents were proud of you and loved you very much. At a young age you stood up and took care of them. Your relatives did not. The house is yours.  Your relatives can make all the threats they want but they have no rights to the house.  It is yours. Bought and paid for.  You allowed your grandparents to stay in their home.

At the very, very worst, there probably should've been a gift-in-kind reported at tax time (for the difference in the value of the house vs the sale price), that's the only thing that could maybe bite the OP here, but I'm frankly not sure how that all works in this kind of situation, I don't think the relatives will be able to do anything if the sale was done legally, which it seems to have been.\n\nNTA.", "They wanted you to have that home, keep it and disregard your disgruntled family.

You didn't swindle your family from their inheritance.   Your family members made an assumption and they were wrong.  They can be pissed but they're not right.  You made an agreement with your grandparents to buy the house and keep it in the family and that's what you are doing.  Your Aunts and Uncles can get bent if they don't like it.\n\nIt probably feels like a betrayal because besides from 1 Uncle, no one else knew about the sale.

Even so, the family members may still try their luck with a lawsuit since there's a $1m house on the line.\n\nPurchasing the home for 10% of the value doesn't help OP's case. Hopefully they have sufficient documentation to defend themselves.", "You also lived rent free. Absent info on others being a holes to your grandparents as opposed to just not super involved, I'll say NAH because I can completely see why they think you took advantage of your elderly grandparents. Anyway you twist it, you still came out ahead by almost a million at the expense of your family members.", "If they live in the US the gift giver pays the tax but individuals have a lifetime gift tax exemption of 12 million dollars so they are probably good. OP might be looking at a big capital gains tax bill if he ever sells it though. Always a good idea to have a lawyer involved with real estate transactions.", "They sold it to me a few moths after my grandpa pretty much returned from deaths door, and it had really hit my grandma that she would not be able to afford to live there after he died", "while also swindling his grandparents.\n\nPeople downvoting me need to read up on Elder Abuse Laws.", "Why are you attacking OP over this? A bit jealous, are you?", "Jealous? Nah. I\u2019m doing ok. \n\nIf OP wanted to act in a fiduciary capacity, he should have placed his grandparents interests above his own. Instead, his solution to \u201chelp\u201d his grandma, who was apparently in financial straits, was to buy her house for 10% its value while also keeping the transaction secret from all but one family member."]}
