My grandpa was in a wheelchair and my grandma had just gone into remission from cancer. Around 2020 when Covid started to become a serious concern my grandma was seriously wondering what would happen if her or my grandpa died because they would not be able to live in their house that they had owned since around the mid 1960s, it is according to my grandma, an old governors mansion from the 1800s it has 10 bedroom 5 bathrooms on 15 acres of land when they bought it it needed a ton of work and they have spent the last 60 years making it a wonderful home and both wanted to die in that house they had raised all their children in that house and even some grandchildren it is the family hub everyone had grown up here. after one bad health scare with my grandpa my grandma realized that if she lost him she would no longer be able to afford the house with losing half of her income. So i offered to buy the house from them, i have a fairly high paying job for my area and because i had been living there rent free while taking care of them i had quite a large saving, originally i told her i would just give her the money or help her out but she didnt want charity so she and my grandpa sold me the house for $90,000 (roughly 10% of the properties value) and i would let her live there until she died (which of course i would) because they knew i would keep the house in the family and most of my Uncles and my mom just wanted to sell it for a quick buck (only 1 uncle, josh, knew about them selling me the house and didnt mind at all because me and him had almost exclusively done all the maintenance or house work on it for years). \n\nUnfortunately my grandpa died in april 2021, and after that my grandma\u2019s youngest sister moved in to spend time with her because they were both widows and could emotionally support each other, so i took advantage of the covid interest rates and bought another house about 10 mins away so i could still be close by if she needed anything but have my own freedoms. Sadly last week my grandma passed away and after the funeral the whole family gathered for her will reading, my Uncles all got nice items, my uncle josh got my grandpas Old 1940-1950s Ford truck, my mom got all my grandma jewelry, i got nothing (because I already got the house), the reading ended. All of my relatives were confused about the house and asked the lawyer to which she said the house was already sold. Well it didnt take long to for them to put 2 and 2 together and i am now getting harassed by most of my family saying i fucked them and they need the money from the sale of the house and some have even threatened to sue me if i dont sell the house and give them their rightful inheritance. \n\nSo aita for \u201cscrewing\u201d out of their inheritance\n\n\nUpdate: I ended up talking to my Uncle Josh about what has been going on with the other family members and the harassment over the house, and at about 8 tonight he called everyone in the area and told them to all come to his house tonight as the oldest brother for a family meeting everyone complied when i arrived a couple of my uncles had some choice words but Josh told them to stfu went into his room and brought out my Grandparents original will before the more recent one that they had left with him. In the will it stated that he would inherit the house 100% and the reason was because of all the work he had done to it, over the years he had put in a pool, fixed the cracking foundation replaced the roof and so much more,  and that my Grandparents had involved him in the sale to make sure that he was ok with not getting the house. He had told them that he didnt want a big house to take care of and with him retiring soon he wanted to take his money and travel and not worry about what was happening to their house this basically squashed any complaints.\n\nSo this has been a roller coaster of a day but tank you everyone for the kind words, im ready for a nice stiff scotch lol", "created_utc": 1692733321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yg9rd/aita_for_buying_my_grandparents_house_and/", "score": 1124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would also separately total up how much they would have otherwise had to pay other people to do all the maintenance work you did on the house. Then I would add that all up, because I'm willing to bet that it will far exceed 90% of the market value of the house. I would then suggest to your relatives that you would be more than happy to give them the house in exchange for them paying you for the work you did taking care of their parents for more than a decade, which offer they will obviously refuse because even if they sold the house, the proceeds wouldn't cover what they would owe you.", "Just go talk with a lawyer and have all communication go through them.
