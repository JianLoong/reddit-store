Your *duty* is to prioritize your son's safety and well-being. You'd be grossly violating that duty if you left your son alone with someone whose drug addiction issues have been serious and causing major concern.\n\nFor one, she might just pass out on the floor and neglect him. For another, she might be so high she does something that gets him hurt. And *he* could find whatever she's taking.\n\nNTA", "NTA - the safety of your child is the most important thing.  Your mom can get real and when she acts out re: \"bad guy for keeping my son away from his grandma\" she needs to hear that until she is clean and sober she will NEVER be left alone with your son.\n\nHarsh, but she needs to hear it.", "Safety of a child is above everything else. You are NTA and you will never be one so long as the child's welfare is the priority.", "NTA\n\nYou were right to refuse the woman private access to your child. Hell, how could you know for certain she wasn't high when she made such a ridiculous demand. \n\nGrandparents can bond with their grandchildren while the parent supervises. You may not be able to help your relatives understand, or help her with her addictions, but you can prevent your son from dangerous bonding time with an addict.", ">Am I in the wrong for prioritizing my sons safety and well-being\n\nHow is this even a question? \n\nNTA", "NTA, if you purposely leave your child with a drug addiction, you don't deserve that child.\n\nBe frank with your mother and let her know given the situation she's lucky she can see your child at all and that if she wants more access she needs to clean herself up.", "NTA.   \nYour son's safety is the main priority. The grandma herself is responsible for the distance between her and her grandson. Besides, you didn't keep him away from his grandma. You did agree to letting him meet her long as you were present to but the grandma declined.", "NTA and I can\u2019t believe you have to ask. Who the hell would leave their child with an active addict? You\u2019d be putting your child in serious danger if your mom made poor decisions, was around dangerous people, or overdosed. Whoever is saying you\u2019re the bad guy is an AH and enabler.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s not only a reasonable boundary it\u2019s the only choice, leaving your child alone with someone in active addiction would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous", "NTA.

Period.", "I can't think of a world where people would be telling you to leave your child with an addict.", "Of course you're NTA. You don't want to leave a kid with an addict! Even if she doesn't harm him directly, there are plenty of other ways she could cause harm. What if she passes out and then your son gets badly hurt or wanders off or something? Or let's say GM passes out, and after a day her neighbor hears the boy crying and comes over to find he's been on his own and hasn't eaten? That's something that could be reported to Child's Protective Services: \"Mother left her child alone with a substance abuser.\"\n\nIf he visits he needs to have another responsible adult there.

You\u2019re doing the right thing for everyone, even your mother. She needs to see that her addiction is affecting her life in big ways.", "We told my father the grandkids would not be coming around until he stopped smoking.  It was the incentive he needed to quit for good.  Drug addiction is much worse, in my opinion. NTA.", "Nta", "NTA. Do not under any circumstances let people pressure you to put anything above the safety and comfort of your child. He is not an emotional support animal and anyone who finds it wrong to not want to leave a 7 year old with a drug abuser is NOT someone whose opinion you should take into consideration at any time.", "She wants time alone with her grandbaby to bond. She\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s a desire not a need.  Giving into someone else\u2019s desires isn\u2019t always a good thing. In fact in cases like this it\u2019s dangerous. \n\n\n\nYour family that supports her wants you to believe she won\u2019t be doing  any harm to him as she is his grandma. That\u2019s both a desire and a delusion. Being around an addict can be very harmful for a child, especially alone. \n\n\n\n\nThe only real needs here are the family that is supporting her needs to reenter reality and the most important need: Your son needs to be kept safe and cared for. That\u2019s not going to be achieved by letting him be alone with grandma. NTA", "Nta all the way. I cant imagine any solid argument out of those arguing with you. It's not you that's making things difficult...", "NTA  NO is a complete sentence. Learn to use it!", "NTA. You would be insane to allow your child to ever be alone with her for a minute, never mind overnight. \n\nAsk your deluded family members if they'd leave their kids alone with her. The idea that she wouldn't harm your son because she's his grandmother is ignorance at a staggering level.\n\nIf you were hiring a babysitter and her resume said drug addict would you hire her?  It's not about what she would plan to do, but what her drug-addled brain will do.  And it has nothing to do with when she took her last dose.  \n\nDrug addiction changes the brain.  It's not like she takes a pill, and 8 hours later, she's back to her old self.  Addicts and their enablers will say they would never dose around the kids, so what's the problem.\n\nThe problem is that while you can make the argument that they are more than just an addict, the reality is that being an addict is what they are above all else. Addiction is not a part of them. It's everything they are.  It supercedes all else. It's stronger than the needs of hunger, thirst, sex, etc. Certainly above a 7 year old that fades into the background when the need takes over.   \n\nNever leave your child alone with this woman.  Not at 7. Not at 17.", "NTA\n\nAs an overall answer, if an adult (especially one I can\u2019t put my 100% trust into) says they need to be alone with my child that\u2019s a HARD no.\n\nCause like why? What are you going to do or say to my kid that I can\u2019t be there? If it\u2019s all innocent fun, there\u2019s nothing to hide.

Don't even consider leaving the child with your MIL.", "No. No. No.\n\nGod only knows what will happen.\n\nNo. He is 7", "Easiest NTA ever. Grandma is facing the consequences of her actions. If she wants family bonding time, she needs to clean up her act. Never leave your child alone with an addict.", "YTA for even asking. Hoping all these responses open your eyes. You said no and she is acting horribly. That\u2019s not the response of someone who loves you or your kid. Please get some help and healing."]}
