I\u2019m the youngest of my siblings, i was close to my step siblings growing up but after realizing how my step mom and two out of three step siblings use my father and literally LEECH off of him. My oldest step sister(25F) has two kids, her oldest(4M) was named after my brother(23M) and her youngest(7 months F) with my name as her middle name. She didn\u2019t speak to me or my brother about naming her kids after us/including our names in their names and i just think it\u2019s so weird because 1. both of our names are not common AT ALL   2. I haven\u2019t spoken to that side of the family in almost a year    3. my brother and I were always left out of sibling days by our step sisters. the only way i found out about the baby having my name as her middle name was when my dad sent me a picture of the baby with her name at the bottom, i did block my dads number after he sent that as that was the first text i\u2019ve received from him in over 6 months(and i was very upset). I have given them all the silent treatment since then as i want no part of that weird family and i just feel like it\u2019s a way of replacing me and my brother as we\u2019ve grown detached from that side of the family since my dad pretty much prioritized them rather than my brother and I when we were minors. Part of me feels like i might be overreacting but i just think it\u2019s weird that my name was taken without a discussion. So\u2026 AITA for giving them all the silent treatment after that?\n\nEDIT: I do want to give a little more info, so we grew apart after i had tried to be involved with them and they made no effort to be involved with me, I was taking the bus from my community college in the suburbs to the city to go see them, I would try to organize family days on top of my studies, yet when i asked why my dad didn\u2019t bother to call me first he would say \u201cthe phone works both ways\u201d, none of them would reach out to me and that\u2019s when I had sort of detached myself. it wasn\u2019t until after this that I realized how they were to me and my brother growing up, and how they treat my dad. My dad is pretty much the sole provider in their household, which my step sisters and my dads wife live, even though he doesn\u2019t make that much. my step sister leaves her oldest to my dads wife and my dad to take care of and the dynamic is weird, when my dad lost his job his wife didn\u2019t step up or anything to contribute so my dad had to keep taking out loans to support everyone. the announcement of her name was shortly after i had made it into university after being a high school drop out so it was a big thing for me (which none of them congratulated me or even acknowledged me on after my brother told everyone in their household about it), i feel like it was weird asf considering i had accomplished something really big for myself. ALSOOOOO i never said i owned the name, it\u2019s just odd that she happened to name both of her kids after my dad\u2019s only biological children.\n\nEDIT 2: again\u2026 i never said i owned the names.", "created_utc": 1704527885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zuz5y/aita_for_giving_my_dads_side_of_the_family_the/", "score": 758, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, you do not own the name but given the family dynamics and your detachment, it is giving HELLA WEIRD, with a dash of OBSESSED as sprinkles on top of the icing.

What?", "I tried reading this but it's an absolute mess. Go back to school", "\" She didn\u2019t speak to me or my brother about naming her kids after us/including our names in their names\"\n\nWhat a self-entitled, egotistical mindset\n\nYou don't own the names and she had no need or requirement to speak to you about using the names", "I mean, no one \"owns\" names but there is etiquette to it all. It seems very odd that an estranged relative would give both your and your brother's names to her children. I could see liking one and doing so, maybe, but both? That seems engineered and very odd indeed.\n\nAre you and your brother more financially stable or something? I only ask to see if this was meant to be a way to financially provide for your \"namesakes\", as if them sharing your name was supposed to engender some sort of obligation to favor them. \n\nIt's very weird and I don't think you're unreasonable for finding it uncomfortable. I'd keep low contact, personally. \n\nThe only other thing that I can think of (which is a stretch and potentially because I read too much fiction) is that if there is a will in place that names you and your brother without your relationship (e.g., \"to X, I leave...\" vs \"to my granddaughter, X, I leave...\")\n\nNTA for your feelings, for sure.", "YTA. You can't own a name.", "Yta kinda.\n\nWHY are you mad about the name? You were named after a family member, it's a way of honoring someone, and it was her middle name, so not like a replacement or identify issue.\n\nI get the rest of your relationship is strained and you don't I interact with them much. But why is the name a giant offense to you desiring of them being NC?\n\nIt could have been a way to honor you, an olive branch, etc.", "YTA - you don\u2019t own a name, get over yourself", "NTA", "They can name them whatever they want. It is odd, though. And I understand why it might bother you.\n\n The silent treatment is done to keep others from expressing their feelings or addressing conflicts - or simply to punish them. Are you sure that's what you're doing? \n\nOr have you gone no contact because interacting with them is unhealthy or hurtful for you?\n\nNTA\n\nAnd congratulations on getting into university!", "I just know OP has the most basic name like Emily, Emma etc", "I'm pretty sure many people are skipping over things, because that block of text is not reader friendly", "This is why I made sure to include middle names when helping my Dad fill out his life insurance beneficiaries. My brother's (then) wife had the same first name as our younger sister.", "Right?  I was totally confused.  She\u2019s not talking to them anyway.  I seriously doubt if they care that she continues to not talk to them.  She sounds like A LOT.\n\nAlso, she doesn\u2019t own the names.", "hey just wanted to answer your questions, so we grew apart because after i had tried to be involved with them and they made no effort to be involved with me that\u2019s when I had sort of detached myself. it wasn\u2019t until after this that I realized how they were to me and my brother growing up, and how they treat my dad. My dad is pretty much the sole provider in their household, which my step sister and my dads wife live, even though he doesn\u2019t make that much. my step sister leaves her oldest to my dads wife and my dad to take care of and the dynamic is weird, when my dad lost his job his wife didn\u2019t step up or anything to contribute so my dad had to keep taking out loans to support everyone. I will also edit the post to add this but the announcement of her name was shortly after i had made it into university after being a high school drop out so it was a big thing for me (which none of them congratulated me or even acknowledged me on after my brother told everyone in their household about it)", "I\u2019m currently in pharmacy school and my brothers a house inspector. we currently don\u2019t have a lot BUT my dad is supposedly getting a lot of property in a different state from my grandpa.", "yes i\u2019m not talking to them anymore as they\u2019ve made no attempt to hold a relationship with me and my brother after countless efforts from us. I stated in the post that i never said i owned the names but if they\u2019re not trying to have a relationship with us what\u2019s the point of involving our names with her kids? it\u2019s just weird friend, especially since me and my brother are my dads only biological children.", "Its fair to be upset about not including you or acknowledging your accomplishments if that is something your family normally does. But the dynamics between your dad & his wife and their family is kinda none of your business. Would you want your dad's judgment to rule your marriage?", "Sounds like you're (brother and you) financially stable, at least. Are your stepsiblings not? Are you in contact and close with your grandpa? Maybe he knows what's up?\n\nLike I said, it's all very strange. Ultimately, if you're not close, you can just be confused by the situation and let it go, continue with living your best low contact life. \"You people are weird, I'm good with public events.\"\n\nAlso, pharmacy school is hard, go you! My ex (amicable) was in pharmacy and it was no joke. Well done!", "But why do you care?", "It\u2019s not weird.  They are NAMES and your relatives happen to like them.  Probably the fact that they DON\u2019T have contact with you influenced them more than any sort of \u201chonoring\u201d you.  They figure they like the name and their kids will never see you, so win-win.  Let it go."]}
