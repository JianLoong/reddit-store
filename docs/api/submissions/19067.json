This actually says something about your own shortcomings, if you can't make anything that looks good on Jane lmao", "She wanted you to be straight up honest, but not in a way that completely destroys her 15-year-old daughter's self-esteem, and makes you look like a dick. There was a polite way to explain the real reason why you didn't want Jane as a model, instead you went for the most brutal and asinine way to do it. That's why you are also an a****** here. None of us are excusing what Jane and her mother did, we're just not also excusing what you did. Multiple people can be the assholes in one situation.", "\"Sorry, but I just think she is too young.  I don't know what else to say.\"\n\nSee how easy it is?", "I cannot understand the mental gymnastics of this people. You would be a massive AH if you call the teenagers girl fat and ugly, but you didn\u2019t. You tell to the mother, the one who keep pushing, the real reasons. You tried to give a more polite answer but she wanted the true and that\u2019s what she got. Yes, plus size modeling exists (thanks god!), but not all products are directed to this target, so sometimes you need another kind of models. NTA", "Insulting a 15yo when they're not present is just as bad, and even worse then doing it to their face. At least if you had said it her face she could have known how you really feel. And worse still, you said this her mother.", "Your responses here indicate that you\u2019re not actually here for a judgement, you just wanted people to take your side. Every comment is an attempt to justify yourself.", "You don\u2019t like Jane at all, do you?", "So 15YO is not only fat but ugly as well?\nYTA", "No they are not. The answer was no. OP gave 2 godd reasons why not.\n1 only needed one model\n2 Jane is not a legal adult\n Sister did not want to accept them. So she coninued to push. Jane sounds a little spoled. Give me my way or I'll tell/cry.", "LOL darling I am 5ft 3 and 138lbs. I ran a half marathon a few months ago. I\u2019m training for a full marathon now. Just because I don\u2019t buy clothes based on how they look on stick figures doesn\u2019t mean I am \u201coverweight\u201d, just that my triple D tits aren\u2019t going to fit into anything below a size 6. Also, sorry to break it to you, but no one is going to build a business exclusively selling clothes to skinny people. There have literally been brands that tanked using that business model. Can you give any examples of clothing brand that only carry sizes 6 and below that are thriving?? Name one, please! I would love to see what their earnings in the last fiscal year looked like!!", "Still being an asshole to a child even if she wasn\u2019t present to hear", "OP has tried each of your suggestions in one way or another. Maybe with the except of second or third suggestion.\n\nHow many of these suggestions would OP have to use?", "Fine Edit: OP never said that to the daughter.", "Very finely nit-picked.", "Why is this being downvoted? It's correct. Having plus-size models and plus-size clothing is better for business than only serving a small demographic.", "They allowed the daughter to model when she was 17 so that\u2019s bullshit.", "That is bull. Hearing that from OP would at worst give Jane an eating disorder or at best make her cry. Either way Jane would be hurt.", "[removed]", "To be fair, Jane is fifteen and if OP's analysis of her appearance is correct, then she might be a little down on her looks and might be jealous of her gorgeous sister. \n\nThe only real asshole here is Jane's mom.", "No OP wasn't. You just want to be angry / right.", "One way or another isn't trying each suggestion. But that doesn't even really matter. What matters is her words hurt people. I just said it's wrong to a call a child fat and ugly. mainly the not pretty part cause who cares about fat. \n\nIf you think it's okay to call a child ugly, then be my guest. That's it.", "they're really stringent when it comes it particulars around here, huh?", "Incredible that this was necessary. It's quite evident what OP thinks of their niece from the post...", "It\u2019s still objectively an AH move to tell someone that their child is fat and ugly.", "You can't backseat-drive someone else's business. It's OP's prerogative which aesthetic and demographic she's targeting.\n\nIf the niece or her mom want the niece to model for a plus-size oriented brand, they're free to start their own.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

There is a larger plus size market these days then they're used to be, so OP is essentially alienating at least half of their potential customer base by doing it this way. They're perfectly within their rights to do so, but that doesn't mean that they're not an a****** for doing it. You can be technically right and still an a****** at the same time.", "Say it with me now. CALLING A CHILD FAT AND UGLY IS NOT OKAY. You 40 year old bully. Grown ass adult. Yes. Lie. Who gives a shit. \n\nThis isn't about Jane's mom. It's about Jane. Jane is the one insulted not her grown mother who I don't care about. You think that kid doesn't hear that already from school and total strangers? As her family, you shouldn't be causing more anguish. Don't be dick and call a kid ugly. \n\nIf you think it's okay then let's end the conversation. Cause I'm not changing my mind that she was out of line calling that baby fat and ugly.", "You can offer more sizes for sale and market them on smaller sizes, that's actually what generally happens and seems profitable enough. Marketing is generally a \"expectation vs reality\" song and dance, you're originally sold on an idealized version of something."]}
