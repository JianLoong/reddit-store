{"id": 14391, "submission_id": "12gth1f", "title": "AITA for forbidding my mother to attend my child's memorial?", "selftext": "I'm 31 and a single mother. I went no contact in May of last year with my mother. She has consistently used, abused, neglected, and always put a man first with all three of her children and to this day uses the classic, \"I did my best.\"\n\nIn adulthood, she has literally lived 15 minutes away for me for over two years. I had to beg for her attention or for her to come over. I wasn't comfortable being at her house because her husband is extremely homophobic/transphobic (my eldest is trans) and just unpleasant to be around. She always had to clear it with her husband first.\n\nThe day I cut things off, I was calmly and respectfully trying to express to her how she makes me feel. She would not, at all, hold herself or her husband accountable. It absolutely killed me to cut her off. It was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made. I desperately wanted a mother, but my mental/emotional health was suffering because of her. Today, she has zero contact with all three of her children.\n\nFast forward to now. My two year old daughter passed away suddenly and unexplained a week ago. I've barely been coherent enough to get out of bed for the past week. I wake up crying and I pass out crying. I've barely been able to stomach any kind of food or drink. I'm in the darkest place of my life.\n\nMy mother calls my abusive ex husband to try and track me down. He texted me to say she was on her way to my apartment. My ride-or-die has been staying with us this entire time to make sure myself and my boys are taken care of. She absolutely offered to stand guard at the door. She pulls up and is begging to be let in. She's going on about how that's her grandchild, that she has a right to be included, that she's suffering, etc. She complained because no one called her the night it happened, though she admitted that she wouldn't have had cell service because she was on a cruise in the Bahamas. She even went so far as to tell my ride-or-die that I need someone here who can actually take care of me. She complained because the obituary didn't mention any family members, other than my daughter and her brothers.\n\nShe has made my child's death completely about her. She even had the audacity to ask my best friend if she could get some of my child's ashes to keep for herself. She posted on FB about my child's death, trying to rake in sympathy. There was no mention of me, my boys, or any other family member, and the pictures she used of my daughter were screenshots she took from my daughter's obituary. She is determined to find out the date and place of this memorial, very much against our wishes.\n\nShe's been nothing but rude, insensitive, and entitled throughout all of this and has made me suffer through this tragedy far more than I should have to. She point blank asked my ride-or-die if I truly do not want her at the memorial, and I told her to say yes.
