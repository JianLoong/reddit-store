{"id": 5240, "submission_id": "zqyd4l", "title": "AITA for not adding my fianc\u00e9 to the house deed?", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 (F27) and I (M33) are going on 5 years of dating now, engaged for over a year now. I love her DEEPLY and want a family and future with her. She still lives with her parents while I own the house we will end up discussing.\n\nIn the summer of 2021 her aunt and uncle decided to sell the house they were living in and move out. I ended up buying the house because:\n\nA) She always stated she would like to live close to her mom\n\nB) she said she would love to keep the house in the family\n\nC) IMPORTANT - having stated my intentions to marry her, her family graciously sold the house at a discount. It was appraised at around $140k. I ended up buying it for around $100K. No mortgage, paid cash. House was obviously in my name alone, no other strings attached. My dad and I did another estimated $15k worth of work on it after.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 DID contribute with painting, decorating and furniture, which she bought exclusively with her own money.\n\nTHE CONFLICT\n\nLast night her mom said something along the lines of \"well of course once you get married you'll add her on the deed of the house\". They both noticed the silence on my behalf and became visibly offended. My reply could be summarized by \"Why didn't she contribute to buying the house then? I bought the house with my own money and did all the work on it with my own resources. Why would I add her to the deed?\" Uh-oh\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 feels deeply hurt and offended that I would not add her to the deed. Her arguments can be summarized by:\n\n\"What's mine is yours and that should work the other way around as well.\"\n\n\"This is a sign that you don't trust or love me.\"\n\n\"I will never feel at home if I'm not on the deed of the house. It will always be YOUR house only.\"\n\nShe calls it being coldhearted. I think it\u2019s just fairness and pragmatism but I DO see where she\u2019s coming from, truly.\n\nI felt taken aback a bit as well. We have different mentalities when it comes to money. I like to save, she likes to spend. (Shocker, I know.) She\u2019s NOT irresponsible, especially relative to her peers, but she\u2019s not a big saver either. She\u2019ll ALWAYS give me such a hard time for \"being cheap\" and \"overly concerned with money\", then she'll turn around and in a very entitled fashion, demand I add her to the deed of the house which I bought exclusively with money I\u2019ve scraped up over the years.\n\nI fully view this as a home for the BOTH of us and I WANT her here. Most of the time she's very loving, caring, well-mannered, respectful and I think she'll make a fantastic mother and life partner. But I feel that it\u2019s too convenient to lecture someone that \"in marriage everything is 50 / 50\" when one saves much more than the other. I DO NOT expect parity, I expect to be the primary breadwinner. I\u2019d just appreciate to see that she\u2019s at least tracking her expenses or trying to save a bit more for our future.\n\nWelp...give it to me straight. AITA?\n\nP.S. TO CLARIFY! Since everyone seems to have the impression that the ONLY reason they sold ME the house with the EXPRESS PURPOSE of having it split after the marriage. THAT IS NOT THE CASE. They had no strings attached to the deal and no one even brought it up at that point. Nor did my fianc\u00e9 OFFER TO PAY FOR ANY OF IT! I would have bought the house on my own regardless of the discount. I had no other debt, a stable job with excellent credit history and I was pre-approved for a mortgage of over $300k. I would have taken out a mortgage myself and with the massive down payment, could have afforded the resulting minor monthly payments easily. Probably would have paid off the rest of the house within the next 1 - 2 years. Originally they were going to sell it to one of her brothers but he backed out because the house seemed too old to him and he knew it would need a lot of work. That's when my fianc\u00e9 swooped in and said that I should buy it since I had the money to buy it with cash.\n\nP.S.S Since it still seems to be the primary issue here. NO ONE made it clear that there was an EXPECTATION to put her on the deed. Everyone was well aware that I am the only one paying for the house and that I am the only person going on the deed. WHY WAS IT NOT AN ISSUE PRIOR TO THE SALE. I paid for the house and did all of the repairs on it almost exclusively, if it matters, I estimate her contributions to furniture and decorations at less than $5k. Now all of this becomes a major issue as we are planning our wedding.\n\nWhy not offer to buy the house together back then? If she really wanted it I would have been more than happy to take out a mortgage WITH her and start paying it off together. But that was not at all how I was approached. Again, not complaining, I DID get a discount but I am also the one who poured all of my money into the house, NOT her.\n\nAdditionally, I am definitely open to having a living trust or will that relinquishes everything to her in case of my death or something along those lines. That is not an issue.", "created_utc": 1671567211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqyd4l/aita_for_not_adding_my_fianc\u00e9_to_the_house_deed/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you think once you're married she doesn't deserve any equity?  How do you intend to handle finances once you're married?  This sounds financially selfish and like you're entitled to OPM.  If you had bought this house on your own without her family connections and discount we may be having a different conversation but you didn't.

She is still getting half lol", "YTA. She did contribute to buying the house; her relationship with you got you a $40K discount and automatic equity. You also bought a house that she wanted to keep in the family (preventing others in the family/her from taking action or finding funds to buy it), without disclosing that you were buying it only for yourself and not for the two of you (so not keeping it in the family). And then you decide that you do not want to share funds or property in your marriage because you have different philosophies, which, okay. But she's not irresponsible with money (as you admit), so what is the risk in sharing ownership of a home you bought from your wife's family with your wife's help with your wife?", "YTA the family sold you the house at a discount on the condition that you are marrying her. Once married all assets should be split equally.", "YTA. You bought a family home from *her* family, and you don't want to add her to the deed *after you get married*.\n\nRead that again. Keep reading it until you realize how ridiculous it sounds.\n\nI think you two have a lot to figure out before you get married.", "Sooo...your fiance told you about the house and wanted to keep it in the family. You got in your own words the family deal which saved you $40,000.00 dollars that you would not have gotten if you weren't marrying her. But if things go south like it sounds like it is...she walks away with nothing but a broken heart and you keep the killer deal that wouldn't have happened without her and the home she wanted kept in the family is no longer in the family. \n\nYeah you are ta. The aunt and uncle gave you $40,000.00 of automatic equity which was her contribution since again you would not have gotten it without her or even known about the house and amazing opportunity. \n\nBut hey if money and mine mine mine is your hill to die on then maybe it's a good thing she knows this before the I do's. I truly feel for this girl. Her families gift to you and her time in helping to fix it up obviously mean nothing.", "YTA. Her family gave you the deal because they knew you are going to marry her, and probably wanted her name on the house as well. Also...she did contribute? You said that she helped with painting, decorating, and furniture. While that doesn't add up to the amount of the house, its usually a hefty sum. She put money towards it too, and to be basically told that \"its not really yours\" is a slap in the face, especially when you are planning to get married, in which you should share and split assets evenly. If you two were to get divorced, she would lose everything and have no place to live, despite it being a house that her family wanted her to have (which is why they gave you a deal).", "YTA. You are together for five years. You got a helladeal bc of who she knew. Yes, she wanted the house. If you were not her bf you would have paid nearly 40% more. You got a deal. Why wouldn\u2019t you add her to the house AFTER you got married? \n\nFinances are a huge reason couples do not stay married. You need to be on the same page.

From the get go that was my impression. And I know for a FACT that as a parent, I would not allow my child\u2019s SO to financially benefit so greatly if I had any doubts of their relationship future. Her parents did that thinking their daughter would be living there as a HOMEOWNER. It sounds very bait and switch.

No one here is going to change your mind, you will come up with a defense for every comment without realizing that you are wrong.  You will spin all of the information you can to argue your point.  Let's just address the Edit here, since you CLARIFIED it so well:\n\n1) There were no strings attached.  Maybe they didn't realize they needed to draw up a contract for something that is so obviously the right thing to do.  They gave you $40k off the value of the house because you will be family.  Would they have done that for a stranger?  They did it because of your fiance.  Consider that her contribution to the purchase of the house.  Consider her additional work on the house a wash with your work.  If you can't see this, you are wore than I thought.\n\n2) Get over the money thing.  What's next, a spreadsheet that you go over every month with your future wife on money contributions and who does what? This relationship seems purely transactional for you.\n\nPut her on the deed to the house and if you do end up splitting in the future, sell your share to her.  Legally do you have to?  No.  Should you as a human being?  Yes", "YTA. She gave you $40k in the form of a family discount. I understand not adding her name before marriage, but JFC dude. Way to forever ruin your relationship with her family.", "40k discount. So I don't exactly think you need to put her in a deed but you got a \"family\" discount. I know you did not ask for it but they assumed things and thought that it was clear for you as well. \nIf they wanted her on the deed they played it badly as you are not obligated to give her anything, you are still unmarried and I'd say the marriage is on question right now.\n\nYou kinda made your own bed doing \"business\" with her family. I'd would be easier to buy random house without strings attached.\n\nI'm voting for soft YTA for being so emotional and aggresive in your post.", "YTA. Nice to know you only care for her when she spends money on the house and gives you a discount.", "Soft YTA. Even if it wasn't explicitly stated, you should know they gave you a discount because of your fiancee. If you get married, I'm assuming she will be contributing to the upkeep of the home, so yes, it's her home and she should be on the deed as well. Did you even ask your fiancee if she was going to contribute at the time?\n\nI also understand where you're coming from, and you should communicate it delicately with your wife. You've worked hard for your money, and on the off chance you get divorced, you don't want to be screwed over. A solution to this would be to grant her partial ownership (29%). \n\nHowever, once you go down this path, the rest of your relationship is going to be all about nickel and diming each other for the rest of your life.", "OK, these type of posts really piss me off. \n\nWhen you get involved with someone and are planning your life with them, ARE YOU NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PARTNERS!?!?!?!\n\nlike fuck, yes, right now you may have the uper hand financial but guess what - life happens and in 10yrs from now she could be supporting your ass. \n\nWhy does everything have to be mine, his, hers!?!?!?\n\nI swear to christ no one things of the long game anymore.

Yeah, no way I\u2019d sign up for that.\n\nAlso thinking in this what really makes you the AH was not making this clear when you bought it. You say she didn\u2019t offer to buy it with you but\u2026did you even discuss that with her? Like was there an actual discussion or did you just jump in and buy it?

What happens if something happens to you after you are married and she is not on the deed.  She will have no place to live unless she buys \"YOUR\" house off of your estate.

The sold it to you because the want to keep it in THEIR FAMILY. They gave you a MASSIVE discount. That was her contribution. Without her, YOU WOULD NOT BE A HOMEOWNER.

You are right not to put her down on the deed.  It was 100% paid for with your money.  People on here saying that when you get married her name should be on the deed just because is absurd.  It's just wrong.  **It's NOT a trust issue it's a numbers game.**  ANYTHING can happen between now and then that if you did put her name down on the deed it could come back to bite you in the ass.  This isn't a piece of furniture.  It's a house.  Even when you purchased the house, there was nothing in writing that stated she would get part of the house (especially without contributing to the financing) and expecting to on the grounds of \"just because\" doesn't work in the world of finance.

I love her DEEPLY and want a family and future with her. She still lives with her parents while I own the house we will end up discussing.\n\nIn the summer of 2021 her aunt and uncle decided to sell the house they were living in and move out. I ended up buying the house because:\n\nA) She always stated she would like to live close to her mom\n\nB) she said she would love to keep the house in the family\n\nC) IMPORTANT - having stated my intentions to marry her, her family graciously sold the house at a discount. It was appraised at around $140k. I ended up buying it for around $100K. No mortgage, paid cash. House was obviously in my name alone, no other strings attached. My dad and I did another estimated $15k worth of work on it after.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 DID contribute with painting, decorating and furniture, which she bought exclusively with her own money.\n\nTHE CONFLICT\n\nLast night her mom said something along the lines of \"well of course once you get married you'll add her on the deed of the house\". They both noticed the silence on my behalf and became visibly offended. My reply could be summarized by \"Why didn't she contribute to buying the house then? I bought the house with my own money and did all the work on it with my own resources. Why would I add her to the deed?\" Uh-oh\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 feels deeply hurt and offended that I would not add her to the deed. Her arguments can be summarized by:\n\n\"What's mine is yours and that should work the other way around as well.\"\n\n\"This is a sign that you don't trust or love me.\"\n\n\"I will never feel at home if I'm not on the deed of the house. It will always be YOUR house only.\"\n\nShe calls it being coldhearted. I think it\u2019s just fairness and pragmatism but I DO see where she\u2019s coming from, truly.\n\nI felt taken aback a bit as well. We have different mentalities when it comes to money. I like to save, she likes to spend. (Shocker, I know.) She\u2019s NOT irresponsible, especially relative to her peers, but she\u2019s not a big saver either. She\u2019ll ALWAYS give me such a hard time for \"being cheap\" and \"overly concerned with money\", then she'll turn around and in a very entitled fashion, demand I add her to the deed of the house which I bought exclusively with money I\u2019ve scraped up over the years.\n\nI fully view this as a home for the BOTH of us and I WANT her here. Most of the time she's very loving, caring, well-mannered, respectful and I think she'll make a fantastic mother and life partner. But I feel that it\u2019s too convenient to lecture someone that \"in marriage everything is 50 / 50\" when one saves much more than the other. I DO NOT expect parity, I expect to be the primary breadwinner. I\u2019d just appreciate to see that she\u2019s at least tracking her expenses or trying to save a bit more for our future.\n\nWelp...give it to me straight.

I'm a bit shocked this hadn't come up in convo sooner tbh.\nI think Esh because everyone has assumed and not actually discussed anything, and now there needs to be some relationship repair.\nThere's nothing wrong with coming from different view points but the way it's being chatted about isn't very healthy or helpful.\nI'm very much a what's mine is yours in my relationship, because for us that's part of it. If you don't operate that way and she does, you both have decisions to make.\nGood luck.", "I think the Aunt and Uncle would assume since you're getting married, it would be BOTH of your house. You would not be getting that discount if it were not for her. I think knowing how much money you were saving, you should have made it clear that it was just yours.  At the very least, you should be giving her the percentage of the house that you didn't have to pay. You just saved yourself 40k almost a third because of her and you can't even do that? Doesn't seem fair either.", "I see your point but YTA. She's right, it will always be \"your house\". I think you know it will be \"your house\" too, & thats why you dont want her on the deed. She didnt pay for it, so why should she be on the deed = its my house not hers. & she might not have put money towards the sale price but you did say she bought furniture and invested time by painting, so she DID contribute. You also got a huge discount because of her. I know you didnt need it, but you got it. I think that this is an issue that will be a huge rift between you two(as well as changing the way her family sees you) & I honestly think you're letting your pride get in the way. \n\nDepending on where you live, in the event of a divorce it might not matter if she's on the deed or not, it could still be split up; so I personally see this as a non-issue. Unless there's some other issue you have with putting her on the deed, I think you should do it. \n\nAgain, I see your point, but you really need to choose if this is a hill you're willing to die on.", "YTA \n\nIt sounds like you got the family and friends discount for this house, so your fiance actually contributed $40k to the purchase. The fact that you COULD have purchased the house without the discount is irrelevant. You took the discount right? You aren't going to venmo them the saved $40k right? That saved money has value!!\n\nI would not marry a person that already has such a clear you vs me attitude. Your fiance is right when she said that what is hers is yours and what is yours is hers. That is what marriage is!!! \n\nAlso, if you disagree on finances, as you clearly do, then you should not get married. It will not work. IT WILL NOT WORK. This house is a clear example and I guarantee if you do get married without getting on the same page about this issue then your marriage is going to begin and end with resentment.", "Yta her family literally sold it to you at a discount *bc you're engaged to her* She 'contributed' 40k right there. As well as the interior.", "NTA: You paid for the house. You were dating at the time, and things happen, so there was no guarantee you would have worked out. I'd say talk to a lawyer about what you can do to protect the house for yourself and if its possible to do that while still adding her.", "YTA", "NTA\n\nBut this should have been discussed and expectations set before purchasing the home. You can always have her added as the in case of your death the house passes directly to her. If I paid for a house on my own and with cash before marriage, I would not add my partner after marriage. This may be an unpopular take but I believe in clearly defining premarital assets before the wedding.", "YTA. You\u2019re wrong dude. Just wrong. If you\u2019re that worried about your $100k house, get a prenup.", "NTA. Your fiance told you it was for sale and you should buy it, but made no mention of being on the deed, buying it together, etc at that time. You bought the house with your money, and didn't get a mortgage that she could pay until her equity equals yours. The house was sold to you with no agreement she'd be on the deed. You've put money into your house, and she didn't contribute. But now that you're talking marriage she feels entitled to half the equity in your house just because she's marrying you. If she wants her name on the deed, she needs to pay you her half of the purchase and improvements. You expected her and her family to be honorable, while they expected a huge gift of half the house in her name for the honor of marrying her.", "NTA. You bought it no strings attached. She did not offer any money and you bought it outright. Tell her to give you half then you'll talk.", "YTA. Nothing is more gross than someone who views life with their spouse as a business transaction. Either add her to the deed or do her a favor and don't marry her and sell her family back the house.", "NTA. Going against the grain on this but I feel like she should\u2019ve put her name on it during the purchase if that\u2019s what she wanted. \n\nI think you two need to work on communication and set out all the expectations before getting married though. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the only surprise that will come up that is important to one or the other\u2026I\u2019m also trying to understand why she still lives at home at 27 and not with you in the house if it was so important to her. Also wondering why she didn\u2019t want to put in $$ for the purchase. So many questions really.", "NTA there y\u2019all go again with the double standards.

Once she moves in will she be splitting the bills? Will she clean the home? Help with projects, buy more furniture? This is bizarre. She is going to be your wife and you are treating her like a roommate. Her name should absolutely go on the home.", "ESH - the only reason you got that house with a discount is because you\u2019re marrying your fianc\u00e9e. The value of the house is now estimated at 155K (140 + 15 you added). The 40K discount is counted as participation from your fianc\u00e9, and it represents about 25% of the whole value so if we approach this with a math point of view, this is how much she \u00ab\u00a0owns\u00a0\u00bb. \n\nNow you\u2019re the AH because you\u2019re acting as though you would\u2019ve been able to buy this house for 100K if you weren\u2019t about to marry her, and she\u2019s an AH because she doesn\u2019t save enough money to contribute to these types of purchases at all, and you\u2019re both AH because you didn\u2019t communicate about your financial intentions (regarding the house and savings in general) beforehand", "ESH and you may not be compatible. She's a spender, she's a saver. Oil and vinegar yet neither of you are lettuce. \n\nAlso, have you started your estate planning? Depending on where you live, if she isn't on title the house will go into your estate when you pass, and she'd have to pay the tax portion of its value to remain in the house. Based on her spending/savings, this money would come from your estate. Do you really want to pay for the same house twice because you don't think she's earned being on title now?", "NAH (other than your sexist comment, but I\u2019m over looking it). If that was a stipulation of the discount they should have said that before you bought it. As long as you don\u2019t plan on charging her rent to live there you are not the AH. She isn\u2019t an AH for wanting to be on the deed.

You're conflating unrelated issues. \n\nAnd she did make it clear from the start. You got a deal so the house would stay in the family.", "OP the comments 'spring this outrage on me?' and 'I DO see where she\u2019s coming from, truly.' don't really go together.  I get that the two of you come from different cultures and have different levels of familial support but that doesn't entitle either one of you to discount the other's contributions, financial or otherwise.  Think about counseling before you marry because measuring a partner's worth by the amount of  actual dollars they contribute never works.  Either she's your equal or she's not.  You decide.", "Depending on where you're located, you actually have less protections when cosigning a deed outside of marriage. My husband waited until we were legally married to add me to the deed since it offered better protections and I was contributing to household maintenance & repairs. The only reason you got the $40k discount on the sellers price was because you were marrying their niece so it was presumed the house would legally be kept in the family after your marriage with her name being added; if you never intended on adding her to the deed then you should have told her aunt & uncle upfront so they could re-evaluate their discount.", "You're insufferable.", "I'm sure that at that time she thought a 40000 dollar discount was her contribution.as well as anything she's purchased or done in the house .", "I think the fact that you are considering what happens in a divorce is a neon sign that you shouldn't get married. Sell her family back the house and move on.", "Just so. He \u2018saved\u2019 $40k because of who he marrying.", "If OP paid $100k + $15k for extra repairs (making his stake $115k) and the value of the house is approx. $155k ($140 value + $15k extra repairs) how is $40k close to half? I don't know how these things work elsewhere but in Australia it's possible to add someone as an owner of a certain % of a house (e.g. 25% / 75% split).", "Why is he even marrying her, I wonder? I can understand getting a pre nup but not this, especially if they have children. Is it going to be a case of, that's daddy's milk in the fridge and that mummy's juice?", "Well they probably weren't explicit about it because they didn't expect you to be so selfish. Honestly, they should have waited until you were married to sell it to you.", "Give her $40k and call it even", "You're an asshole Dan and you're certainly not the man.", ">having stated my intentions to marry her, her family graciously sold the house at a discount\n\nBut the discount was.", "You can't say it had no impact though, even if it wasn't explicitly stated", "Of course it was. You're an AH for nitpicking about it not being a formal contract, like a bride price is still a thing.", "I think you are just telling yourself that to justify being an ass. You had been together for years and the plan was to get engaged and married, I'm sure no one thought they had to explicitly spell it out for you....but lesson learned.", "You\u2019re making too much sense, OP won\u2019t be able to understand you.", "Fair point. And if we're talking fairness, I owe $40k to the aunt and uncle. In would gladly reimburse them if it comes to that. I completely don't understand the people who so eagerly justify my finance capitalizing on mostly my investment and her aunt and uncle's sacrifice, while she only put down money for paint and some furniture.", "The message I got from it was different. So if that was the message that was delivered, I can imagine other saw it that way too", "Since you are clear that you will divorce, you are drafting a tenant agreement for her, right? You are clear that is only your house; should you decide you are tired of her, she will be SOL. You at least better give her some protections. That\u2019s the deal with transactional relationships. You get a house, she gets $40000 plus interest and a tenant agreement.", "I live in a state where anything purchased during marriage is considered a marital asset. When my wife and I bought our house. I wasn't able to be on the mortgage. Because I wasn't at my job long enough. Last year we refinance the house and now it's in both of our names.", "If you don't want her on the deed then give her $40k.", "It honestly seems to me that to not put one's spouse on the deed signifies a lack of trust. In which case, why are you getting married?", "Premarital property purchased with 40K in equity from your fianc\u00e9.", "You\u2019ve been with her five years? That\u2019s the first time my SO and I bought our first home and I was on the deed. Two homes later I\u2019m still not married to him and still on all of three of the deeds. You kind of sound like you scammed her family if the plan was to keep it in her family.", "The question was rhetorical. What if she was, had no income, no savings, and no credit? Do SAHM (regardless of marital status) not get added to deeds on homes because they do not contribute money?", "This situation has been put up here more than once. And anything it\u2019s a woman owning the property and the man wants to be put in the deed or mortgage or whatever it\u2019s always NTA .", "No not all families are like that which is why I think they should have stated that or better yet drew up a contract of sorts", "So he pay the extra 40k is he in the clear?", "If that was what they wanted as a condition of him buying it at the discounted rate, they should have put it in writing. That's not on him.", "Is an extra 25% of ownership worth the potential impact this would have on your relationship?", "Sell the house at market value, give the aunt $40k from proceeds of sale and buy a house together with your fiance, problem solved :)", "You should give her ownership of at least 30% of the home. She and HER family contributed 45k, you (and your dad) contributed 115k. This means she contributed 29% of the cost and value, not to mention you got to buy a home with no mortage and interest because of HER and her family. With interest rates going up, you've saved a lot of money with not needing to take out a 300k loan that you mentioned in the comments that you were approved for. \n\nAnd make sure you both have a last will and testament asap. If something should happen before you are married, she will probably not automatically inherit you, and might be left homeless or co-owner with your parents. (Delending on laws where you live). Don't be greedy. I'm not saying you have to give her the whole house, but at least 30% of it is hers, even though you are only looking out for yourself. So shitty. You're smart enough to understand that this discount was intended to help out their niece, not just you. The discount is her contribution, not yours.", "You should really break out of the mindset of righteous indignation before getting married. You *need* to have construtive and mature conflict resolution skills and that includes having some humiliy even when feeling absolutely justified (not saying that you are, but that is obvisously how you are feeling)\n\nTake a step back. Is this house and argument worth your relationship. If it causes a breakup will you not feel anything towards the fact that it was an in-the-family home that they offered you because they see you as in-the-family and as someone who has their daughters best interest in mind? Do you have their daughters best interest in mind?", "For wanting half a house for free", "Ok how about property upkeep?", "I've obviously failed at communicating the fact that I'm not excluding adding her to the deed. We're discussing whether I was the asshole to not concede that when she confronted me out of nowhere with it and demanded I do so. Again, this was a done and settled deal for well over a year now. All of a sudden it's an issue.", "I came to say this.  He should pay the money.", "Again, no problem. No one is asking for $40k though. She's asking...no...DEMANDING...for her name on the deed of the house that I paid for fair and square without any such issues being brought up at the time do the purchase. AGAIN, no one seemed to have an issue when it was obvious that I was going to be the only person on the deed and the only person paying for everything.", "Uses of terms like \"exploit\" doesn't really lend credibility to the point you're trying to make. I'm also not sure you're doing the math correctly in your head. I put $155K ish into the house. She put $5k max. In a worst case scenario, let's say we sell the house and split it. With appreciation we can maybe sell it for $180k, if I'm being really hopeful. So she walks away with $90k and I walk away with less than I put into the house?\n\nPlease explain how I'M the one trying to \"exploit\" HER?", "Definitely op seems oblivious as to why the family and his fiance are pissed", "Or you could just accept that it was the price of putting your future wife\u2019s name on the deed. Why don\u2019t you want to do that?", "And don\u2019t demand any payment for standard property upkeep or remortgaging etc if she\u2019s not on the paperwork (since you\u2019re her landlord, I guess??)", "This! Two people don't even NEED to be officially married to share a house deed, but if there is love and trust, they frequently will be.", "It's obtuse to think that he would have been sold the house at all if they didn't believe she would be living in it.", "It's obtuse to think otherwise and not a good trait for a partner. I think she should cut and run.", "That\u2019s a ridiculous attitude to have.

I don't understand what's going on with your comment.", "So when did you pay her for the $40K she saved you?", "Are you lying here or in your post? You said explicitly you paid 100k cash and did 15k in renovations. Where are you getting you put in 155k?", "She saved you $40k. Period. \n\nYou\u2019re being a dick.", "She put an additional $40k into the house. Time to pay up.", "She got you a 40k discount lol what a weird hill to die on. You asked if you were an asshole, got a response you didn\u2019t like and now you\u2019re digging a hole. I hope she finds this and dumps your sorry ass lmao. Take the judgement and grow up.
