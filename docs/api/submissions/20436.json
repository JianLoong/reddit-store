My wife (29F) was not crazy about the idea of me dyeing my hair in this first place, and all of a sudden said she likes my increasingly obvious grey hairs.\n\nI definitely got my dad\u2019s genes. His hair started greying in his mid twenties, and by 40 he was perfectly salt and pepper. Now he\u2019s approaching 60 with almost no brown hairs left. He decided to go grey gracefully, I didn\u2019t want to do that.\n\nOne night over dinner, I mentioned to her how I\u2019ve been seeing grey hairs since my early twenties, and my method of dealing with them was to pluck them out with tweezers, despite always hearing how that\u2019s counterproductive. Eventually, they were growing in faster than I could pluck them. And more recently, I noticed an alarming amount of half-grey hairs that were in the process of becoming full grey.\n\nFed up with it on a personal level, I told my wife I want to dye my hair. I told her that I\u2019m not ready to go grey yet, and I\u2019m gonna go buy a hair dyeing kit that matches my hair color, which she adamantly refused to let me do, as if I asked for her permission. She started complimenting my greys and saying that it\u2019s sexy, and that dyeing my hair is pretty feminine and she wouldn\u2019t find it attractive if I did it.\n\nI have very thick, curly, shoulder length hair that I take good care of. I\u2019m proud of my natural hair, but I feel like I should have a say on when I let it turn grey, even though my DNA and wife say otherwise. So I did it. For my first time ever attempting to dye my hair, it turned out great, and I was surprised with how easy the process was. All of my greys are gone, I\u2019m satisfied with the way it looks, and she noticed right away. She acted like I betrayed her in some way. She has had nothing to say about my hair, and it feels as if she looks as my differently now. It\u2019s almost as if she didn\u2019t want me to be confident in my looks. Is she overreacting, or AITA?", "created_utc": 1687579506, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hiuys/aita_for_dyeing_my_hair_against_my_wifes_wishes/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's your choice. Her comment about dyeing being feminine is nonsensical.", "NTA. You deserve to feel right with your looks. Does your wife ever do her hair? i.e straightening, curling? Does she wear make up? If so. She does it to feel more confident, so why shouldn't you or any men be able to do the same.", "NTA Your body, your rules. Question though- is your wife controlling in other areas of your life? Because her reaction is really not okay. Maybe it's a one off, but if there's a pattern here, you might have a deeper problem.", "NTA, your body, your choice. I wouldn't say she's an AH either, but the seeing dyeing your hair as feminine comment bothered me just a tiny bit.\n\nI dye my hair frequently. I'm on my 3rd bleach which most people consider unhealthy, but I've taken very good care of my hair. Many people look down on dyeing greys because it can cause damage, so just make sure to take good care of it.\n\nAlso, your wife definitely wasn't lying about you looking sexy with greys, just so you know. You'd be surprised how many women find it hot and how it gets hotter the older we get. But its also okay to not be ready for them yet. Do what makes you happy and confident, she can deal with it.", "NTA. . . Literally tons of different dye kits for men, including for facial hair. I wonder if the things she brought up were all she could think of to manipulate you......... also, when you dye your hair have some paper towel and rubbing alcohol ready to wipe dye off your skin after its been applied, done forget to wipe it off your ears too. Do the wipe down before it developes to prevent dye on the skin patches. The industry has improved in not being so bad, but it sure helps to be pro active.", "NTA.\n\nI started going grey at 13.  I was totally grey by 18 (genetics). I took the coloring route for a few years, and its been every color in the rainbow, and then some.\n\nIf coloring your hair makes you feel better,  keep doing it.  I does grow out.  \n\nNow, if you were bald and had \"hair\" tattooed on your head,  that I would take issue with.  : )", "NTA. Your body, your choice.", "NTA - Your body, your choice. However, as someone who also started to grey in his 30's, I'd advise you to *not* color it. \n\n* 1) Unless you spend a lot of money on a professional colorist, everyone will know you're dying your hair. \n\n* 2) It's a lot of maintenance. Once you start you're going to have to keep it up every 2 or 3 weeks. \n\n* 3) Your natural hair color is always going to look better and as a gay man, I can tell you a grey hair on a man is very sexy. It gives him an air of maturity.", "NTA\n\nYour wife can give her opinion if asked but she ultimately can't control what you do to your body. If dying your hair made you happy then be happy with your newly dyed hair. Don't let your wife make you feel bad for doing something that makes you more confident.", "Without even reading, NTA.

Go ahead and do what you want, but be aware that it *may* cause her not to be attracted to you anymore.\n\n(Disclosure: My own hair is long and curly and approaching white at this point.  My wife likes it this way.  My beard is almost entirely white.  Basically, I'm undergoing Gandalfization.)", "NTA- but feel free to tell her you will stop coloring your hair and hiding the aging process you don't like if she is willing to do the same. No coloring her hair, nothing to hide wrinkles, etc. Tell her that if she can throw a fit and try and control how you look, you will abide and treat her the same way.

There are a few products restore the lost melanin so your natural colour is returned (not a dye) and you don\u2019t end up with that Lego man block of brown hair - never tried them myself as my partner is totally down with the salt n pepper.", "NTA. She will need to get over it. I\u2019m 40, and I\u2019ve been steadily losing my hair since my early 30s. My wife prefers me having my hair on the mid-length side, maybe 2-3 inches, and messy. But I just can\u2019t pull that off with the crown of my hair being so thin now. When I get my haircut, I just get it clipped with a #2 clipper; it\u2019s not shaved but it\u2019s a very very close buzz. It just looks better. She laments it but it is what it is. I need to feel comfortable too.", "NTA. Why would she think she can allow or disallow you to do something about your own hair? That\u2019s really odd.", "NTA \nYour body your rules\n\nShe will get over the hair colour let her grieve the sexy grey  she\u2019s probably had running through her thoughts", "NTA It's your hair, your choice. If it makes you feel more confident, even better! It's a bit of a red flag that she acted controlling about it, though. I think a frank conversation about why it bothers her so much is needed (maybe in a couple of days when emotions aren't high?) and ask her, if the situations were reversed, how would she feel. Hopefully she's able to put herself in your shoes, apologize and the both of you can move past it.", "NTA- it's your hair! I wouldn't dream of telling my fiancee what to do with his hair or beard and I'd be pretty irritated if he insisted on me keeping my hair in a particular way.", "NTA. Your body your decision.", "Your body is obviously your choice. but I would prefer my wife's choice of look in my hairstyle (not a controlling wife).", "NTA. As it's been said, your body your choice. I would recommend working with a professional stylist from here on out, because they will be able to color your hair in such a way so that it will look natural with the grey blending in better when the roots start peeking through between colorings. A professional stylist can also help you transition back to the grey more gently when you feel ready to let the grey grow out. Think about how strange it might look if the upper half of your hair is grey and the bottom half brown before it grows out enough for your to completely cut off the brown...unless you're into that look, then rock it all you want.", "Hahahaha. Can never win. I dye my husbands, I like it but then he sometimes think it doesn\u2019t look natural and stuff and now we\u2019re on the fence if we\u2019re going to dye it again haha. Have to respect the person who\u2019s hair it is\u2019s decisions \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03 it\u2019s just funny cause this story was the opposite lol.", "Not that I\u2019m aware of. I really don\u2019t know why this rubbed her the wrong way, but I really like the way it turned out and I might just have to touch up my roots when they eventually turn grey.", "Yeh, I was okay with her commenting about the sexy grey. Then she had to go and ruin it with her \u201cfeminine\u201d comment. Which was a bit of a out of nowhere thing to say. \n\nOP - NTA. Do what ever makes you happy. It\u2019s your hair and your choice.", "Maybe I don\u2019t pay much attention to detail, but my hair looks exactly the same as it did before I dyed it, only without greys. The shade I bought matched my natural brown perfectly.\n\nI do agree, lots of men can greatly pull off the silver fox look, and I will eventually be one of those men. This was more of a test to see what it would be like to not have gone grey in the first place, since my hair wasn\u2019t this long in my twenties when I first started noticing them, and to see what kind of reaction my wife would have to it. Now I know that it\u2019s not good, I\u2019ll keep that in mind next time I looking at grey roots in the mirror. I had to try it at least once \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "You certainly have the right to dye your hair if you want. My husband is salt and peppery; like you, his dad went gray early. I\u2019d be heartbroken if he dyed it, because I find it sexy as hell - but it\u2019s his body. I don\u2019t ask his permission when I want to put funky colors in my hair, and he never cares. You are NTA, but I can also understand your wife being a bit sad.", "I think everyone just has different preferences about how their partners look, but I agree her comments were mostly out of line. I want my boyfriend to be happy with how he looks, but I also want him to know that I think he looks great just the way he is. And I also don\u2019t really ever change the way I naturally look so I would be pretty hypercritical if I asked him to change his style for me.", "You probably already know this, but the maintenance is due to regrowth. If there is a big difference in colours between the grey and your natural hair colour, you'll see a sort of halo of grey regrowth on your head every few weeks (depending on how fast your hair grows). So if you want to keep the greys away it ends up being lots of frequent dye jobs, at least to colour the roots. And then every now and then you need to do the lot because the colour can fade a bit. \n\nAlso I would suggest going to a professional to confirm that the initial colour is right, even if you do want to do diy from then on... it may look fine late at night in the bathroom but out in the daylight the colour might be too warm or too cool for you or a bit patchy."]}
