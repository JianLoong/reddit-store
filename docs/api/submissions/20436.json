Eventually, they were growing in faster than I could pluck them. And more recently, I noticed an alarming amount of half-grey hairs that were in the process of becoming full grey.\n\nFed up with it on a personal level, I told my wife I want to dye my hair. I told her that I\u2019m not ready to go grey yet, and I\u2019m gonna go buy a hair dyeing kit that matches my hair color, which she adamantly refused to let me do, as if I asked for her permission.

Your grey hairs affect your self-confidence, and you deserve to feel good about how you look.\n\n2. She won't find you attractive for looking the way you did before you started going grey??? No, ma'am. She needs to imagine you saying something like that to her and see how it would make her feel. \n\n3. It's not okay for her to attack your masculinity. Period. No exceptions, no excuses.

Which is what I think about my husband whether he's thinning up top or what not.  It would definitely challenge my presuppositions about my husband if I saw him dyeing his hair.

This is why you see such terrible haircolor on old guys out in the world. Box dye is also very difficult to remove. So if you want to get rid of this, you are going to have to grow it out. Meaning your roots are going to be gray, and the rest is going to be odd colored box dye. You say your hair is long, so you are looking at 3 years minimum for a total grow out. Box dye doesnt fade, the gray will not come back once its been covered in box dye. \nWomen truly love men with gray hair. Im a haircolorist and a woman. I dont dye mens hair with anything other than a demipermanent - which does fade. You cant get that in a drugstore. \nYour wifes complaints are odd, the feminine comment is odd.

But a tip... As someone who has dyed my hair for many years, I would caution you to choose a dye that's a little lighter than your natural shade. So many men pick the color they had when they were twenty five and it looks like shoe polish - many of them sports announcers and coaches. As we age, hair naturally lightens. It looks incredibly unnatural to have very dark hair when the face softens and the wrinkles develop. \n\nBox hair dye almost always comes out darker than one would expect based on the info on the box. I have naturally light brown hair, and I use a level seven dark blonde to keep the greys in check. No one would ever call me dark blonde, but that's how the chemistry works."]}
