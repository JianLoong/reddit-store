He lied before to get money, of course you're not gonna trust him easily now. It's his fault for destroying your trust and he has to earn it back little by little. Confessing is not enough.", "HA! Soooo NTA. He's already proven he can't be trusted not only with money but with telling you the truth.", "Yeah but did he ever pay you back for the gambling debt?  Does he still gamble?", "NTA. If he wants credit for lying to you about the first $1000, he should pay you back that $1000 since he took it from you under a lie.  Talk is cheap, actions speak loud, which is why you met him at the vet.  He\u2019s just mad you got smart.  He can ask someone else to be a sucker.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
