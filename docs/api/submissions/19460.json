However, Instead of the \u201cslave\u201d comment, you should have said \u201cif we were in the 19th century, you\u2019re marriage to my sister wouldn\u2019t have been allowed\u201d.", "You are labeling your comment as racist but I see it more about correcting his perception. He seemed to think that historical persecution justifies his hatred. You were not using historical oppression as a means to suggest that he deserves to be oppressed. In fact, you were using it to demonstrate the opposite: that historical oppression is not a justification for contemporary hatred. Correcting hatred by pointing out a historical fact like that is not racism. \n\n\nIf a black man tells women they should not have the right to abortion because it wasn't mentioned as a right in the original constitution, wouldn't it be fair to mention to the black man that the original constitution allowed not only slavery, but prohibited black men from voting, speaking in public, and existing in public spaces created for andby white people- along with all sorts of other oppressive laws designed to keep black people from having anything?", "NTA AS A BLACK women I find this hilarious. \nHe said what he said it was not In correct and what you said was also NOT in correct \n\nIf He can\u2019t take it don\u2019t dish it out. There is no need for you to apologize or feel this is racist. \n\nIf anything your family owes you an apology for not supporting you more when he says these type of comments for 6 years. \n\nYour sister has allowed this disrespect and now she has the nerve to not be talking too you. \n\nWhy the hell have you not been NC with her in the first place. \n\nAnd tell your bf to grow a pair. SOMETIMES you have to be harsh with harsh people. \n\nI BET he thinks twice about saying something to you in the future.", "OP, you are *not incorrect*.  And you said what you said after being prodded.\n\nAnd now your family isn\u2019t backing you up.  Look and see who is the favorite in the family. And it isn\u2019t *you*. \n\nI am so sorry. NTA", "NTA. You told Leo off harshly and the truth, a fantastic comeback. Apologize to your mother, but have a frank talk with your sister and other family members, that you will not tolerate Leo's homophobic or disrespectful behavior in the future. If your sister cannot keep Leo in check, you best better completely avoid him. Sorry OP.", "NTA. He opened the door, you just walked through it.", "NTA great comeback", "NTA, sure it was harsh but in that context, I think it\u2019s a legitimate answer to his original statement. He\u2019s a lot worse so I\u2019m not going for everyone sucking even though that\u2018d technically be more accurate.", "NTA...hahaha nice response. \n\nIts a great comback... it shows how times change and opinions and ideas can evolve.", "NTA - I don\u2019t think your response was racist but I can see why he does. He is homophobic, so he is using history to justify his hate, so in his mind, you must be racist and using history to justify \u201cyours\u201d. Obviously it\u2019s not the case, you presented a counter argument to his that held equal weight insult-wise. Nowhere did I read that you made it a personal attack, it was a historical fact. \n\nYou need to speak with your mom though - ask her if she wants to be a happy family, why must your happiness be sacrificed for others? Why must your dignity be sacrificed for their \u201chappiness\u201d? Ask her to stand up for you and that the next time Leo and or your sister makes a homophobic joke, for your mom to say \u201cthat was homophobic, do not say that, please apologize\u201d. Similarly request that if you do the same, she responds in a similar manner. If she says no, you did everything you could. It\u2019s not worth sacrificing your peace and dignity to make others happy. I would recommend going limited to no contact for your own sanity.", "NTA u returned the same exact energy. Cant be hateful to other minorities when you are in a minority, it\u2019s all oppression either way the coin is tossed.", "NTA- dude wanted to play dumb \"if we were...\" games. And sure, \"he started it\" isn't an excuse, particularly as adults. But this guy is attacking you and you are only human. Just tell your mom you are sorry, that you know reacting to his homophobic comments is in poor taste and that you know you shouldn't engage even when he starts an argument he can't possibly win. Tell her that you are only human and that you wish you had never escalated bc you know he is wrong and two wrongs don't make a right. Your mom will feel better and you will look like the bigger man.", "NTA. Was your response the best option out of the possibilities? No. Was it reasonable? Yes. Was it funny? Also yes. \n\nYou know who is an asshole? Your sister for marrying a homophobe AND allowing him to make bigoted comments aimed at her brother. Also your mother and every family member who chooses to let the homophobia slide. F*** homophobic family members", "NTA. Eh, I don't know if they were burning homosexuals in the 19th century but your retort was factually correct, for many places. ESH, but he deserved the clap back, imo,  hence my NTA. Signed a black history major.", "NTA. Also not racist.", "NTA he had it coming. He disrespected you long enough.the fact that no one in your family has stood up for you is appalling.", "NTA", "you might be an AH for saying that, but its justified and he was a bigger AH. your family\u2019s reaction kinda shows that they tolerate your sexuality, but dont fully support you, otherwise they\u2019d be mad at him too.", "Not gonna lie, im 100% black and I chuckled at that reply. You know you\u2019re an AH for being racist but youre not an AH for snapping against a homophobe. There are a lot more ways to insult someone than to go straight to racism.\nBut if your family doesn\u2019t understand how the situations are not different and how messed up he is for saying it, then Id consider going LC or NC", "NTA, you met his energy and he didn\u2019t like it. Ironically, you could have just said he too would have been burned like hell for daring to date someone white.", "Dude im Black, and i gotta say he deserved it, as someone from that comunity i cant understand how my brothers and sisters can possibly be homophobic\n\nEither way you were kinda of a asshole, but not enough for you to reach out to him first\n\nEAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Obviously your sister has signed on the dotted line with a known bigot so she's not somebody to look to for support. Your mom, based on the little I can see, sounds like she's set on playing big happy family without doing any of the groundwork on her end to see what she wants instead of this circus. Leo sucks for the obvious fact of being an outspoken bigot and everybody who allows this targeting to continue co-signs that bigotry. You also suck for having thought, even in the moment, that responding to bigotry with bigotry would have improved literally anything about this situation. \n\nAll I can really offer is that you could cut these people off for some actual peace of mind.

I get why - as an attempt that the comparison will make him realise how bigoted and shitty his attitude is- however, rarely will bigots learn 'under attack' and if anything it just gives them fuel as to why you're 'the villain'. Everyone around you will now rush to his defence as he can play the victim. It's not fair, it's a double standard and your family should be sticking up for you and shutting Leo's views down.
