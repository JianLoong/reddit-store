If someone went to their house it looks like they are still together and i don't even exist. Whereas they are nice to me but I can tell they are just putting up with me for my bf. I feel like they are just waiting for us to break up. I really don't know how to deal with this because I've told my bf and he has said if I feel that awful he won't talk to any of them again if I'm so upset by it which I don't want. He also said that his family were her family and I just have to deal with it, but my family don't talk to any of my exs after we broke up or keep pictures up.

Imagine breaking up with someone and your family refuses to remove your ex's photos from being on display?\n\nYou bf offered to never talk to his family again?  And then said you just have to deal with it?  Those are contradictory statements.\n\nIf you're uncomfortable, don't go to their house.  He dated his previous gf for 3 years and unless his family disliked her the next person he dates can't expect to step right into her place.\n\nInfo: did you bf break off with his gf to go out with you?", "NTA - his family weren\u2019t \u201cready yet\u201d after the breakup?? I feel that\u2019s a super weird reaction\n\nnot inviting you to family events this early isn\u2019t necessarily an issue (they\u2019d known her for 3 years and they\u2019ve known you for 7 months)\n\nhas your bf asked his family to take down those pictures? or to invite you to family events?", "NTA\n\nBut the future of this relationship has been shown to you, in vivid detail, for 7 months. Do you truly want to continue on that path?", "Don't visit them.  There is no reason why you should put yourself through it.  At some point they will have to recognise that your boyfriend has moved on.  It may well be that they will discover they have to work \\*really\\* hard to establish a congenial relationship with you, after these silly shenanigans, but that is not your fault.\n\nI don't think your boyfriend should put the responsibility for his not talking to his family onto you.  He doesn't seem to be able to decide what he wants to do here.  So just step away from the family gatherings.  If your boyfriend allows his family's behaviour to alienate you altogether so that you break up with him... well, I guess you will have learned something useful.\n\nShort version: if your BF is not firmly on your side, you don't hold any of the cards.  The only option is not to play.\n\nNTA", "NTA wow they\u2019re creepy", "NTA,\n\nTalk to your bf, see if he steps up to fix this mess. For the time being, don't go to their house if you can avoid it. You don't need to be around them if they are being like that. Also, if your bf is not fighting for you, leaving is a valid option. It is his family and his job to deal with them.", "NTA.\n\nTalk to your bf and set clear boundaries. Don\u2018t engage with them too much as long as they treat you so horribly!", "I've never understood how people get weirdly attached to their so's family and vice versa. If I break up with you, you and your family are gone from my life. You break-up with my brother,  bye Felicia \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "His family is going to keep ignoring you, and worshiping her, until either you get fed up and leave, or he bows to family pressure and breaks up with you. Then they will push the two of them back together.  Either way they get what they want. He has shown you who he is by not refusing to go when his family is so clearly disrespecting you. Time to find a better man.\nNTA", "INFO: His family were her family - what does this mean? You also say they hadn\u2019t cleared her stuff out yet, so I take it she lived with them? What exactly was the situation?", "NTA but the best course here is to try not to let it bug you so much.  I know that's easier said than done.   But my advice would be to just ignore it.   You are at their house and there's a picture of bf and ex on the table?  Ignore it.   A conversation crops up about how charming ex is?  Nod politely and let it pass.    Don't like that they follow her social media?  Why are you seeing that -- if you don't want to see their comments, don't follow her and/or turn off notifications about their comments on social media.  \n\n\nIt wasn't just the bf that had a relationship with this woman, his family did too.  They like her.  They probably aren't liking her 'at you'.   Maybe they are, but try giving them the benefit of the doubt.  They've lost someone they were already thinking of as family.   Being unpleasant about his ex will only make you look bad to them.  With time, if you and bf stay together those photos will come down and the interactions on social media will peter out.  \n\n\nIt's totally fine to be bothered by this.  But try not to let it show, and try not to obsess.", "So your BF expose you to all of this and he thinks its no biggie? You have to re evaluate this relationship.\n\nYour feelings are valid, but it seems that he dont want to choose between you and his family.", "NTA, but give it time.  You've been around for 7 months.  They were together for 3 years.  Of course his family got invested.  It seems a bit unhealthy on their part.  But give it time to shake out.  \n\nThat said, your bf needs to communicate with his family that his old relationship is over & they need to move on because he already has.", "INFO: Did ex live with them in high school or something? What does \"his family is her family\" mean here?\n\nA bunch of adults ignoring their adult child's relationship for someone they broke up with as a teenager is truly bizarre. \n\nFor what it's worth, whatever the explanation is, you don't need to deal with stuff like this in your relationships if you don't want to.", "YTA\n\n>because \"they don't know me\" but she would have been invited.\n\nThey were together for three YEARS.  You've been with your bf for all of seven MONTHS.  Give it time, OP.\n\n>go to see her very often and comment on all her social media\n\nIt took my six months after my brother split with his serious ex-gf to stop calling her my sister - and now roles have flipped; My brother is friends with her again and I can't stand her for more than 5-10 minutes at a time.   Just because your BF broke up with her means his family stops being friendly with her.\n\n>he has said if I feel that awful he won't talk to any of them again\n\nDropping all of your family members because your gf of 7 months is upset is NOT a healthy mindset to have.", "ESH\n\n1. They broke up for the reason, he chose to be with you. Trust him till he gives you reason not to. \n\n2. The way they disrespect your bf by inviting her to family gatherings when he is obviously with someone else, it is not very healthy. You should be concerned about your bf\u2019s view of this situation - is he ok with it? Does he think his family should treat her like a family member? Try to understand dynamics of their relationship with her. Your jealousy will not help anything. The more he feels safe and loved by you the more they will realized that you are not going away. \n\n3. Don\u2019t do anything like - Pick me! It\u2019s her or me! It is childish. Tell your bf that you would appreciate if his attention during the gatherings will be on you, that if they (e.g. parents) invinted her then they need to entertain her, it is not your bf job (we read a lot of stories when bf was put in this position). You both need to be united front. \n\n4. Understand that you cannot force someone to like you. The only thing you can do is to be yourself, be civil and friendly and if they don\u2019t like you, it\u2019s their problem, not yours. The more you will fight against them because of her, the more they will push back. Kindness and levelheadeness are likely win them over than your attitude.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Its more that I can pick up on that I'm an inconvenience to them and I would be mortified if my bf felt that way in family home no matter how long we've been together.
