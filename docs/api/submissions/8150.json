But you can carefully evaluate your budget (and her registry) and offer $150 (or whatever) towards expenses or a gift. Let her decide.", "Dude as soon as I hear \"dream wedding\" on this sub I know the person whose wedding is is going to be an AH.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSHe is selfish, not you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust have a lot less contact until the weding drama is over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents are AHs, too. THERE IS NOTING To MEDIATE. **JUST MAKE IT A NO.**", "NTA That is an insane amount of money.  She is the one who is selfish and frankly she sounds childish.", "Gonna get downvoted to the extreme, but it's perfectly reasonable for you to chip in the price of a wedding gift.  Chip in ~$100 and you're done.", "Nta it's not about the money you spend. My husband and I got married at the court house my husband and I have been married since 1989. We went to the court house and are happy. It's not about the party", "NTA. Not your place to pay. Don't be guilted. They need to try something novel. Get jobs and save or do something much smaller. Welcome to the real world. Beer wallet with champagne tastes.", "INFO: why would you ever spend a lot of money on a wedding that's not yours - that is your sister's?  I can see sending a check for a grand or two or something as the gift if you're very close and that amount won't hurt but...she and her fiance should fund her own wedding.  And if your parents or her fiance's parents want to chip in, that's fine.  Perhaps it's time to scale it down by half or more.", "Nope. Bye sista", "NTA\n\nThen let your parents do what they want and don't worry about chipping in.\n\nProblem solved.\n\nIf she decides to hold a grudge or be a certain way about it that's on her and would come off at entitlement.", "NTA.  It is not a sibling's responsibility to pay for a wedding.", "NTA! You are not being selfish. Sister is being incredibly selfish.", "Why do people expect their siblings to pay for their weddings?!?!\n\nNTA and don\u2019t! If she wants this expensive wedding, she needs to figure out how to pay for it without guilt tripping you into paying", "I'm just curious why she would expect a sibling to pay for her wedding. She doesn't want to pay for it herself and it's her wedding, so why should someone else foot the bill?\n\nYou either host a wedding that you can afford, go into debt and get a loan to pay for your dream wedding, or elope/go to the courthouse. Those are the options....\n\nEdit: I'm inclined to believe this is a _wedding culture rage bait_ since this story now involves OP having a lightsaber stuck in his bum during discussions about said wedding...... Reddit is a wild place....", "Next thing you know she\u2019ll be expecting for OP and her parents to help her purchase a $300,000 plus home for her and husband. Ugh, the entitlement.", "NTA. OP, tell your sister you love her and support her, but she needs to plan her wedding with YOUR budget in mind. You'll bring a wedding gift, and that's it.\n\nIf she wants some crazy big wedding, she can pay it off for the next ten years.", "I know I'm old but some of these weddings are a ridiculous cost. I mean if Brad Pitt marries Tom cruise and the tabloids pay the costs in return for exclusive photos then have at it and make many poor flower growers and dove breeders and people who wash champagne glasses very happy but if you have a mortgage or student loans or car loans don't get into more debt for a day that most of the guests won't remember in great detail 20 years later. Just keep it classy and stick to an affordable budget. And don't make your father pay and then tell him at the rehearsal that your step dad is walking you down the aisle and dancing with you.", "Honestly OPs post is a fantasy world post. Who tf would think they're possibly an asshole for this? Fake bs to try to get up votes. If it's real then they're still only after up votes bc he knows damn well this sister is an asshole. At least 50% of posts in aita is fake crap. Maybe I should make up some ridiculous story to feel more popular!", "Why should the sibling pay anything at all?? Not their wedding, not their responsibility, and certainly not their problem.", "Why should they?", "Maybe both? \n\nI make quite a bit more money than both of my siblings. (However, neither has asked me to pay for their wedding). I\u2019m here if they need extra money for an EMERGENCY or something reasonable but I\u2019d absolutely not pay for a wedding over THEIR budget.", "Found the sister.", "Um.
