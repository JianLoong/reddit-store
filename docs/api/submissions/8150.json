I have been saving up for a house and I don't want to blow all of my savings on a wedding.\n\nMy sister is furious with me and says that I am being selfish and not supporting her.

If she can't afford it she'll have to work out a budget for what she can afford!", "NTA, She should\u2019ve planned her wedding better if she couldn\u2019t afford 50,000. She shouldn\u2019t be blaming you or anyone else for not paying if she can\u2019t afford it herself, kind of hypocritical imo.", "NTA. In what fantasy world are you being selfish for not wanting to pay for someone else's wedding? If your sister can't afford all those expenses herself, she should have planned smaller.\n\nI bet if the situation was reversed and you asked her to help pay for your wedding, she would not give you a cent", "NTA.  This is ridiculous.  You are much more entitled to home ownership than your sister is to a fantasy wedding.  One is a fundamental need you would provide for yourself.  The other is a want you're being demanded -- unreasonably -- to furnish where no duty at all exists.", "NTA. Fifty fucking grand. Sheesh.", "NTA. Your sister is TA. If she wants her dream wedding, she has to be able to pay for it herself. It's not your responsibility.", "NTA - your sisters wedding is NOT at all your responsibility. If you offered to throw money in that's one thing, but an expectation of it? No, you do not need to pay for her, she chose to her budget and now it's on her to figure out how to pay for it.", "NTA. Would she be chipping in for your dream house if you could not afford it?", "So, you're selfish for not giving all of your savings to her? Don't give in. You've worked hard and have your own life goals.

Did she pay for your wedding? Did you win the lottery? Is it customary for you to pay for the wedding? \n\nI think that the main way to resolve this is to say that you are sorry but you are not in a financial position to pay for something so expensive when you need to save for a property. \n\nMaybe say you'll give her your time if that's something that would be easier like offer to run errands and as much as you can if that's something you'd like to do?", "NTA.\n\nShe's coming to you yelling \"GIMME GIMME GIMME!\" and then accusing *you* of being selfish?\n\nIf she calms down, I'd offer her whatever amount you'd have spent on a wedding gift in cash up front (with the understanding that it is your only gift to her) so she can spend it on the wedding if she chooses, and on the day of I'd probably get her an inexpensive/sentimental little something with the card. \n\nHowever, if she keeps up this ridiculous, greedy and entitled attitude, I'd just help her out by skipping the wedding so she wouldn't need to pay for my meal, then send her a gift card to Arby's as a gift in lieu of attendance.", "NTA. Your sister is selfish for expecting her family to pay for such a extravagant wedding. If she feels it's necessary, she and her fiance should pay a portion.", "NTA.\n\nStand firm. Perhaps ask her to chip in with your home purchase? Seems only fair to me.", "Nta. You aren't responsible for your sister's life, she is. If you are willing to help her a little, then tell her exactly in what way/how much. If she pushes back ask her how much she is willing to give towards your house purchase and if she has an issue with that, ask her why she's being so selfish and unsupportive of your life goals.", "NTA tell her you will give her the same amount as she gives you towards your home. This is a ridiculous request.", "This is absolutely wild. Some families live in different worlds. No, OP, you are NTA for not paying for someone else's wedding. I feel sorry that someone has to say that to you.", "Sister sounds like an entitled asshole, you are NTA", "Nta. Both you and your parents should work out what you can afford. If she asks for more than that she is being selfish.", "NTA. If you want to contribute, say, \u201cI will contribute X to the wedding, but no more.\u201d She needs to plan accordingly.", "NTA. Her wedding is literally a down payment on a home! If she has it to spend, fine. You do you boo. But if you don't have the money for this type of wedding, it's incredibly selfish and entitled to ask others to pay for it! Her priorities can't be shoved onto others. Don't do it OP. If you do contribute, pay for something specific that you feel comfortable with.", "NTA. Your sister is incredibly entitled. None of this is your responsibility at all. If your parents want to help her, they can do that. None of this should have anything to do with you.", "NTA.  She needs to pay for it herself, and your parents are the only people (arguably) who should feel obligated to help out. If she wants a 50k wedding she needs to be able to pay for it herself.", "NTA. What are all these wedding posts where the siblings are asked to help pay for them? It's traditional the parents pay, or help pay....but the siblings? Yikes", "NTA as in your case, I\u2019m sick and tired of people wanting ridiculous weddings that they can\u2019t hope to pay for. Weddings are really nothing about it, the next day it\u2019s over forever. It\u2019s just people who need to be the centre of attention.", "NTA. You are not selfish for spending your money on things that matter to you and not on things that matter to your sister. \n\nThe fact that she expects you to finance her wedding is inappropriate. Honestly this is a hill to die on.", "Generically NTA, but this:\n\n>I just can't justify spending that much money on one day\n\nis the worst reason to say no.  She's basically asking for a gift of cash for something that matters to her, that you wouldn't spend that kind of money on this particular thing yourself shouldn't factor into your decision.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she needed the money for major surgery, or even for higher education - those are more worthwhile than a massive event that NO one MUST have. Not everyone gets their fairy tale wedding.
