That's the only conceivable way I can think that this would be possible.", ">  She thinks that vegetarian food is bland and we will regret it when our guests go home hungry.\n\nI don't know where you're from but, where I'm from, wedding food is generally bland. Preparing dishes so that 100-300 people can all dine at the same time? I don't know, my friends and I go to weddings, and then stop at some fast/junk food place so we can get finally satiated, sponge up some alcohol and prolong the night. \n\nNo one seems to care that the guests are not 100% satisfied with the food.\n\n> Last night it came to my attention that she CANCELED our catering service and hired a new non-vegetarian one.\n\nThat's just selfish. \n\n> i should have made a compromise.\n\nIt's *your* wedding. Your mom had hers and I'm sure it was meeting her preferences. Why should your wedding too be about her preferences?\n\nIf she want compromise, she can have a non-vegetarian meal at her expense before the wedding. Everybody else who has trouble not having meat FOR ONE MEAL can do the same. \n\nThe only person you need to do compromises with when it comes to the wedding is the bride. \n\nNTA", "As a couple, it's your wedding, your choice.

All desserts are vegetarian. If your mother has genuinely never eaten a meal that didn\u2019t have meat in it, she probably has bigger problems in her future than being uninvited from your wedding, haha.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people in this comments section seem to be having a similar problem? Like, I guess the \u2018veg\u2019 part makes it sound like it\u2019s nothing but vegetables, but vegetarian just means no meat! MOST food counts as vegetarian, and everyone here probably has at least some days when they\u2019re technically being vegetarian. Nobody eats meat ALL the time.", "NTA.  Your mother canceling a catering service she didn't pay for definitely calls for an un-invite to the wedding.\n\nAm I'm really boggled by the comments saying you need more variety.  No, you don't.

Cancelling your caterer and not calling you beforehand is genuine insanity. \n\nShe is going to make a scene at the wedding if this is any indicator of her usual behavior. \n\nAs for the menu, there\u2019s no problem with having a vegetarian wedding. Everyone can eat veggies, no one is being left out because of their diet. \nA wedding isn\u2019t a house party \u2014 it\u2019s not about being a good host, as some said in other posts. This is your one party to celebrate your new union. You guys get to have it however you want it.

Non-vegetarians eat vegetarian things most of the time. They don't need meat constantly, they can eat something without meat *once* (as they have probably done 1000 times before). It's your wedding. You have a catering service that knows how to make tasty, vegetarian meals, your guests won't starve unless they can't eat anything, including the damn wedding cake, without meat.

Aw, hell no! I would have been pretty upset too! I don't think uninviting her to the wedding is unreasonable: If she's willing to sabotage the wedding and is not happy with how things are gonna be at it, she doesn't need to be there. \n\nThis is YOUR wedding. A day about YOU and your fiance. And BOTH of you are vegetarians. Not your mother. Not anyone else. There are plenty of vegetarian foods that non-vegetarians eat everyday that I'm sure you guys could incorporate into the menu. No one is going to starve haha. It's not like you're trying to starve people. haha! \n\nI'm not sure, but perhaps the relatives didn't understand the context of the situation? Regardless, it's up to you who gets to attend the wedding, what does/doesn't happen at the wedding, etc. If she can't be on board with accepting YOUR plans for YOUR wedding and she is going to make YOUR day about herself...She really doesn't need to be there.", "NTA .. seriously all these people hung up on food need to stop.. there are plenty of wonderful vegetarian options that can make a great menu.  Just regular spaghetti with tomato sauce is an example of a dish that is vegetarian but could also be great at a wedding.  Sorry your mom is making it all about her. It's a shame she will miss your wedding for being dense!", "Yes, you are the asshole for trying to push your dietary restrictions on your guests. As a good host, you should offer guests food that they would enjoy, not food that you enjoy. Offer several choices and let your guests decide what they want to eat. \n\nBut of course, your mother shouldn't have changed the caterer on you unless she is paying for it and in charge of that component.\n\nAt this point, reinvite your mother and diversify your menu.", "The only way your mother could cancel your caterer is if she were paying for said caterer. If she was not on the contract that should have never happened. Random people don\u2019t get to cancel other people\u2019s contracts. That\u2019s ridiculous that she did that\n\nNot offering your guest food that they would like to eat is not a great plan for a wedding. You are asking your favorite people to join you in celebrating your marriage not your choice of diet. The day is about you. The food is about your guests. \n\nNTA (but mom & caterers suck)", "NTA this is exhausting", "I am not a fan of forcing vegetarian food on a large room full of people, but I wouldn't call it an AH move.  Just kind of - not hospitable.  But it is your day.  \n\n\nNTA.  Mom is.", "A vegetarian wedding is awesome. NTA. Now check with all of the businesses you are using for your wedding. They have experience with control freaks trying to take over other people\u2019s weddings. Most businesses have a set protocol for this very reason. You don\u2019t need anymore surprises. Good luck OP !", "Your mother called and cancelled your caterer because \u2018she knew best\u2019. That\u2019s not a minor misunderstanding, that was your mother overstepping and disrespecting you as adults. \n\nNTA- she brought all this on herself.", "NTA - your mother was so far out of line, it's not funny.  It's ludicrous that some people are unwilling to try something new, and just eat their vegetables for just one meal.  Stick to what you know is right for you.  Your guests might realise that vegetarian food can be really filling and tasty if it's done right (like meat - do it wrong, and it's horrible).\n\nEdit: Keep your mother uninvited.

I get that y'all are vegetarian - but your guests likely aren't ALL vegetarians.  Are you willing to risk your guests going hungry for a 2-3 hour long reception?\n\nIt's your wedding and at the end of the day, it's absolutely your right to only serve the foods you *want* to serve.", "NTA.

That line really rubbed me the wrong way. Like, it seems you think you should be able to eat everything at a wedding simply because it\u2019s YOUR wedding, which fine, yes, that\u2019s technically true, HOWEVER, a wedding is about HOSTING your two families to join them together with your marriage celebration etc. You are HOSTING your family as guests and you should be treating them as such.
