Both adults in the situation need to know the full picture in order to act responsibly and support each other.", "A few things to consider, building off the \u201cWhat if he hid that he\u2019d lost his job\u201d comparison:\n\n1. What if he didn\u2019t have a job after 6 weeks? Wouldn\u2019t you be upset that you hadn\u2019t had the information to know you needed to budget more carefully during those 6 weeks?? (What if he assesses job offers differently or is less aggressive about applications because he doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s another baby on the way?) \n\n2. How would you feel if you found out he\u2019d lost his job before he actually told you?? There\u2019s no guarantee this will go the way you expect. He could find the order confirmation from the t-shirt or the shirt itself, or the progesterone, or see a voicemail from your doctor, or some other complication I can\u2019t think of right now. I imagine that when he\u2019s already feeling beaten-down and blindsided from the loss of his job, he\u2019d be at risk of having fears he\u2019d otherwise never consider \u2014 like that you may be hiding the pregnancy until you can be sure he\u2019s the father. You don\u2019t want him to accidentally find out in a way that makes the news feel like a scary betrayal when it should be so happy.\n\n3. If he hid that he\u2019d lost his job, that would be hiding news that\u2019s purely bad; a pregnancy is stressful, but *good* news. When he finds out, he may feel that you denied him 6 weeks of happiness and excitement at a time when he needed it most. I think you\u2019re so worried about adding to his stress that you\u2019re forgetting how happy this news could make him.\n\n4. Withholding losing his job would be much lower-risk than hiding a pregnancy: pregnancy has medical implications that he might need to know about. What if you\u2019re in a tragic accident and he doesn\u2019t know to tell the ER doctors that you\u2019re pregnant, resulting in medical decisions that cause a miscarriage? He may never fully forgive or trust you if that happened. You could also have a frightening symptom: the scariest moment in my dad\u2019s life was when my mom almost passed out at the top of the stairs; she barely made it to the bottom of the stairs, weakly calling out for help, before collapsing in the bathroom. After he rushed her to the ER, they found out she was pregnant (with me!). Things that are SO medically relevant should really be disclosed.\n\nOverall, I think it\u2019s okay to tell him that you don\u2019t want him involved in anything that would add to his stress (no need to accompany you for doctor\u2019s appointments, no need for emotional support as you worry about miscarriage, etc), but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re protecting him the way yoh think you are by hiding it entirely. Give it a day or two, sure, and maybe adjust how you approach the reveal, but don\u2019t keep it from him for 6 weeks.
