We do plan to marry. He just graduated college and got his first major job. \n\nHe wants his name on the deed, and I would agree to do so IF he was contributing to the down payment and was an active participant in the entire process. However he isn\u2019t in a position to contribute which I 100% understand, so this means that I have to take care of the entire down payment, closing costs, realtor fees. You name it, it is on me. \n\nI have been the one pursing this, alone. I found my referral agent, they partnered with me to find a lender, I got pre-approved and I hired realtors. I am also touring homes alone. He hasn\u2019t come to one showing with me, I am taking his mom to a few so she feels included. \n\nI do feel it is a bit unfair for him to get his name on the deed at the very end of the process when I have done all of the grunt work, and when I am the one who will be taking care of all of these fees plus a significant down payment. \n\nI feel like there is potential for me to be the asshole if I refuse to put him on the deed\u2026 and that it could be unfair to him because he just isn\u2019t in a position /yet/ to help as much as he would like to. \n\nIn a perfect cookie cutter world he would be on the deed no questions asked, however we just don\u2019t live in that reality. \n\n\n\nAdditional context (if needed):  \nBased on his earnings I have calculated a fair split of the mortgage at 60/40, where I will be taking on the larger portion here. I have factored in his estimated taxes, car insurance (we might share my car, so this could be less), health insurance. Utilities, internet and groceries I have at a 50/50 split. This does leave him with additional funds each month to do with what he pleases. \n\nOn my side, any \u201cadditional funds\u201d will be allocated to home maintenance or potentially overpayment on the mortgage. \n\nI have also calculated out for myself what the scenario looks like if I have to take on all of these costs alone, it is possible, it would mean I am paycheck to paycheck. I am prepared for this scenario if it is necessary. \n\nI have also had a very intense conversation with him asking if he is \u201cin or out\u201d on this, and on us. I bluntly told him that it is fine if he is \u201cout\u201d but I need to know /now/ because it does impact what I should be preparing for.

If his name is on the deed and you break up, he gets half, regardless of your sweat equity AND the amount of money you put in when he hasn't contributed. \n\nHowever, if you want him to pay 40% of the mortgage, well he deserves some assurances as well. I would have said N T A until you mentioned the mortgage split. If he is contributing to the mortgage but doesn't have his name on the deed, if you break up he gets nothing and has to leave the home, while you have gotten significant value from him paying part of the mortgage. \n\nThere's a middle ground here. If he isn't on the mortgage, he shouldn't be on the deed. You are taking the risk, not him. But over time, that risk will shift to him (you are getting equity in the home, he isn't). So, you can enter in to a simple agreement about what would happen if you break up, and there are lots of examples out there. He could get back the sum he paid in to the mortgage, a percentage of the sum, and/or at some point in the future, you could put his name on the deed.", "NAH - If he will contribute to the mortgage, his name should be on the deed. Otherwise he will be helping you pay for something huge while having no rights over it. You keep saying in the comments that it's \"just like paying rent\" but what's the average cost of rental in your area compared to the ammount he'll be paying in mortgage? (I'm asking, because where I live, mortgages are much higher than rent) If he were to rent a place with a roommate, would be of similar value as nearly half of your mortgage? Why are you even buying a house together? Buy it yourself, pay for it yourself (as you said it's within your means) and then draft a lease agreement with him if you two still want to live together. That way, should you break up, you can legally evict him and won't need to sell your house to split anything. You have the right to not want him in the deed but he also has the right to not want to contribute to the payments if he isn't.", "NTA. You\u2019re the one buying the house so your name should be the only one on the deed. However as a compromise, you should draft a lease for him so that he can be assured that if things don\u2019t work out between you, you will give him sufficient time to move out. You should also consider if you would ever be willing to put his name on the deed and what he would need to do to make that happen, such as reimbursing you for half the down payment.

The best part about buying a house is to go visit several and choosing the right one. If he's not even doing that, he's (going to be) just a tenant.\n\nEither way, i'd say NAH. I don't think he's an asshole for wanting his name on the deed, but i side with you on not agreeing to it.", "Ywbta. \n\nYou want him to pay a mortgage to a house that will not even be his. \n\nGo talk to a lawyer.

This seems the fairest way, although he may feel he's paying your mortgage for you.\n\nIf he pays mortgage, but isn't on the deed, I've heard some cases where upon separation they can still make a claim on the house.", "playing house together before you get married is ass backwards imo.

Otherwise you\u2018ve got to count for you the same amount as \u201eunhealthy personal habit\u201c money for your free use.\n\nThis is too high risk.

Wonderful.", "I'm not trying to be a dick here, but how much do you take care of this man?  Cuz if you're figuring out his budgets and including his hobbies so this can happen, what does he do for himself as an adult?\n\nNTA from what's here.  You're doing the down payment, you're in the process, you're buying the home and paying for everything.  Your name and your name alone should be on the deed.", "So, he doesn't have money for the down payment, fine.  What is his reason for refusing to do any of the mental labor of buying a house?  Why won't he do research and go to showings?  It doesn't seem like he had any interest until it was time to put a name on the deed.  Home owning is lots of work - is he going to help find good insurance or call a locksmith to change the locks or research the best air filters for the furnace?  Or is that all going to fall on you too?", "You don't need to calculate his anything. Don't mom him. Not involved? That's okay. You can revise homeownership and deeds in 2 years, or when he will have put effort into paying at least your downpayment in mortgage costs. This doesn't have to be a yes/no, or a now/never in terms of him getting equity in your home. He just has to show he can actively work towards it. He hasn't yet.", "If you guys weren't significantly younger, I would question if your boyfriend is my boyfriend, but at least my guy wouldn't dream of asking me to put him on the deed for a place I bought without him that he also showed no interest in while I was going through the process. \n\nWe split the mortgage 50-50, but I cover insurance, condo fees, taxes, upkeep, repairs (there were a couple he contributed to or covered as a gift because I've been so overwhelmed with how much shit has gone wrong in the last couple months, but the understanding is he does not have to do this. He only does this as a favor to me). \n\nYou can change the deed during a refinance FYI, and considering you are buying right now, I hope you do refinance at the first opportunity. I would propose the following compromise: if he can muster up a lump sum equal to 10% (or whatever) of the remaining mortgage when you guys refinance, you will change the deed to include his name. You can't have something for nothing, so he should be willing to give \\*something\\* in exchange for the very valuable thing he wants: property. If can't even compromise in that way, you have a very unreasonable person on your hands and I'd encourage you to reconsider the relationship.", "You're getting upvotes, but i encourage you to really think this through. You're acting like his parent not partner. Why would you want this?", ">if I put him on a savings plan for a car for himself\n\nYou should take a step back and seriously consider this statement. This is more like what the mom of 14 year old would say. Do you want a long term relationship where you have to handle 100% of the mental load regarding finances? What happens when his car dies but he\u2019s been using all his \u201cfun money\u201d on other things?", "Make sure it is clear on a contract that he is paying \"rent\" to you, not a share if the mortgage. If you concede he's paying a share if the mortgage then he has a claim to a share if the house.      \nHe as a tenant would be able to walk away free and clear if house prices collapse and interest rates soar while you as the mortgage holder would be liable. He can't have that freedom AND want a share if the ownership if prices rise. He can't have it both ways.    \nIf and when you get married you can always add him on or buy a bigger house equally. For now he's a tenant.", "Once you marry and he antes up on the loan. Then then deed can be adjusted in the future.\n\nDoing things out of step cause eventual is such a silly notion", "FYI, if his name isn't on the mortgage, the lender is probably not going to allow his name to be on the deed.

If OP marries this guy, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that he\u2019ll end up contributing to the maintenance of the house but if he\u2019s not on the deed, the house and its equity will belong solely to OP should they divorce. That\u2019s not fair. I know someone that experienced this. His wife owned the house before the marriage and never out his name on the deed. He contributed equally to the mortgage, the taxes and all the renovations during their 30 year marriage. When they divorced, she was awarded the house because despite his investment in the property, it was still a premarital asset. \n\nWhat I think should happen is if OP and her bf get married, they should get a place together and OP should rent out her house to cover the mortgage, taxes and maintenance.

Planning to marry someone and not putting them on the deed is sketch. Do you have doubts you won\u2019t make it to marriage? Then why even date him in the first place?

Not just renter and landlord.", "Do not do this. Do not put him on the deed and do not agree to give him anything.

If you put down 10%, you'd get that off the top and he'd split the remaining 20% with you.\n\nBeing on the deed and mortgage also means he's liable in a default, so it cuts both ways.

A live-in landlord is perfectly normal. People buy condos or houses and rent rooms out their roommates. Just check your local renting laws. It's honestly not that hard.
