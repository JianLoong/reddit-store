Maybe it\u2019s more of a GA/TN thing?", "weird, also from texas and i know women in their 30s who go by both names. my brother is in his 20s and his name is a 2-namer too", "Didn't say they couldn't, or even that OP is TA, because I don't think she is. We have three people in my family with the exact same first and middle name to honor somebody. _Three_. And we manage just fine. OP and her husband chose a different name after the hyphen so it isn't even the exact same. I was only replying to the fact that someone was saying ESH because they, a rando, personally didn't like names chosen to honor someone. But since I didn't give my judgment in my original comment: OP is NTA.", "That's infuriating. \n\nMy sister is due with a boy. I am due with a baby shortly after her. \n\nWe shared name lists but she goes first. She gets boy name dibs. I'd hate for her to shelf a boys name she loved to be courteous of me and for me to then have a girl. \n\nI have similar feelings of people who aren't even pregnant claiming names.", "Agreed. OP def the AH after pulling that stunt. One of my sisters always said what name she wanted to name her son if she had one, as soon as my other sister got pregnant with a boy she took the name for her son as his middle name. There\u2019s AH\u2019s in every family", "Oh no, the first half of a [double name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Compound_given_names) is the same! THE HORROR! How will ANYONE be able to tell the two kids apart?!?!?!", "In a universe where the family reunion has Mary Helen, Mary Rita, Mary Katherine, Mary Brigid, Mary Evelyn, Mary Agnes, Mary June, Mary Margaret, Mary Claire, Mary Christine, Mary Elizabeth, and Mary Tess.", "1. Mary is a common every day name. \n2. Double names are very regional and very standard in certain areas. In the US South, double names are frequently used. \n3. In double names, it is not first and middle.  It is a whole name. Saying they are the same name is like saying Michelle and Michaela are the same name because they start the same.", "Oh my god, you're serious.\n\nHow embarrassing for you.", "I almost went with Scentsy, very feminine", "Dude YES you should see it!!! So many great quotes.  My personal favorite is one we use for my very emotional father: \u201cwhy you want to leeeeeeave meeeeee?!!\u201d", "the greeks invented confessions!", "Omg you should watch it! You'll probably love it. There's also a sequel, and they're in the process of filming the third one now.", "What great grandmother? OP said her SIL wanted to use the name right now", "Yes it does, the SIL chose it first, then OP said they liked Mary-grace and SIL asked that they please not use it and then they kept it a secret(which also means they probably implied they won\u2019t if it ended up being kept a secret AFTER they told SIL). \n\nChoosing it first means telling people first. Nobody even slightly reasonable says they chose a name first before they announce it.", "Still NTA in my book. Is the grandmother not also OP's husband's grandmother? Is he not equally entitled to use the name then? Also, SIL knew OP liked the name regardless and knew there was a chance it could be used. It's not as though OP caught her completely off guard. Nobody owns a name, and having similar names within families is not the big issue that people make it out to be.", "No, OP isn't an asshole for using a name she liked just because someone else asked her not to use it. She didn't \"snatch\" the name up lol don't be ridiculous.", "Nope. sil doesn't own a name. I have so many Johns, Williams, and Maries in my family it's silly. \n\nMary- Grace and Mary-Kay may have even bonded over the shared name, who knows", "Google says #1 from 1880-1946 then teetered around the top 5 till the late 60s. That's not as many generations removed as someone named Agnes is the point I am making. Where as google states Agnes peak is 1900-1920. \n\nI'm not a fan of the name either way. But late 60s isn't that dated.", "It\u2019s moved up 18 spots since last year. It\u2019s increasing in popularity.\n\nA lot of names go through cycles.\n\n20 years ago, there weren\u2019t a lot of babies still being named Vera, Edie, Vivienne, Olive, Hazel etc. And they\u2019re becoming more popular names again in the last few years.\n\nHell, Kindergarten at my sons school has THREE Scarlett\u2019s. I was 31 when I met my first Scarlett (one of the kindy kids, in fact. Her sister is friends with my daughter.)\n\nMy old coworker has Edie. There are 4 other Edie\u2019s at her preschool.", "You just described my family (we're Italian) on my Dad's side. In my family there are six first cousins named for my grandmother and seven named for my grandfather. I also have four cousins named for my oldest uncle, and several named after the next oldest, and so forth.", "LOL", "\ud83e\udd23", "Yes", "Here ya go hun \n\nhttps://youtu.be/IRT1_lRcMJA\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6r5oGlRzkvk", "On second thoughts, maybe luck is on SIL's side afterall since she will have another chance of naming her child a better name while OP's child is stuck with Mary Grace.", "I could be wrong, but it seems like *she* (OP) picked the name and it has nothing to do with the grandma, just that she liked the sound of it (and/or wanted to spite her SIL for some reason): she never mentions anyone but SIL having any emotional attachment to the name, never gives any specific reason for choosing it, and refers to herself as picking the name, not herself and her husband.", "Yep. Southerner here and had a friend all through childhood/teenage years whose name was Mary-Helen and everyone called her Mary-Helen, never ever Mary because she wasn\u2019t Mary, she was Mary-Helen.", "It's funny, my grandmother was Mary Jo and only one of her brothers actually used her middle name, but then he had nicknames for just about everyone. Mine was Lil Bit, or sometimes Lil Britches. \ud83d\ude02", "And Ann too", "Neighbor is Mary-Jane and great aunt was Janie Marie.", "Yep. I knew a Mary Francis growing up, and she was always Mary Francis or Mary Fran, at least. If someone had said Mary, I don't think I would have thought of her at all. Her name wasn't Mary.", "It's a MS thing, too.  Oh, lord, is it ever.  I've had to baby shower more xxx-Grace girls than I can count. xxx-Beth and xxx-Leigh, too.  I have a middle name that is not Anne, but I still get called Xxx-Anne almost every day at work because it's \"cute.\"", "Jim Bob?", "We had 3 Thomases in my family. One went by Tom, the other went by Rick (Tom\u2019s son), & my brother went by his middle name. No one got confused except if they called our house & asked for \u201cThomas\u201d", "Oh no, if you think its just about the names and not OP deliberately causing family drama, then i guess you're not that smart as I thought.", "Indeed", "The only Greek I still remember are the dirty phrases from this film!", "geez I didn't know it sold well enough for a trilogy :o", "It says directly in the post that the SIL chose Mary Kay because it was her grandmother's name.", "I didn\u2019t tell anyone either of my daughter\u2019s names before they were born, but I absolutely told people their names were chosen. And I\u2019ve known many people to do the same. You can choose a name and tell people you did so without announcing what the name is. \n\nWhich is why I asked if SIL maybe said \u201cI chose a name\u201d and OP responded with \u201cus too! Mary-Grace!\u201d Then SIL disclosed her chosen name. OP\u2019s wording leaves room for that to have been possible.", "Could be her brothers wife, or her husband and his sister have different dads or moms", "She can do whatever she wants, but other people have feelings. She knew the SIL wanted the name to honor her grandmother. she knew the SIL specifically asked her not to use it so she waited to tell anyone until it was legally her kids name. Technically no one can tell her she can\u2019t name her baby something, but she can\u2019t go around people to do something they asked her not to and then go all surprised pikachu face when they get upset. \n\nShe had a choice between getting the name she wanted or doing the nice thing and caring about her SILs feelings enough to pick a new one. She\u2019s not required to give a fuck about her SIL wanting it but i hope the baby name was worth the relationship with her SIL.", "I have a Mary-Helen friend too, also from the south lol", "I had an Aunt Sissy and an Aunt Baby. Never knew they had actual names until I was a teenager.", "I only know one Annemarie and she always goes by the full name, nobody calls her just Anne.", "That's how we knew they weren't a family friend, but a telemarketer.", "The sequel came out 14 years after the first movie, just to give you an idea of how long people (myself included) clamored for that sequel. It's a great story, and it's impossible to not love the characters.", "There\u2019s no way of really determining who chose first if nobody told anybody. It\u2019s just a game of \u201cno I did\u201d. OP is actively acknowledging that SIL chose the name first. Which means that SIL chose the name first. If she didn\u2019t, OP would obviously have stated that as that\u2019s a point on her side."]}
