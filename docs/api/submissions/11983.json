In honesty you should have been respectful and choose a different name.

So, why can't you be original?", "A *lot* of people keep the name a secret until the baby is born for a variety of reasons. They want to make sure the name fits, or they don't want people to ruin the name by connecting it to someone negative, among many other reasons. That doesn't make you TA.\n\nThat said, ESH.\n\nIt sounds like you and your SIL were racing to the finish line and whoever got there first got the name. That's a crappy game to play.

I agree they are not identical, but they are similar enough that I can understand SIL not feeling like her daughter's name would be unique anymore.\n\nI don't really think you'll be an AH based on the response, but I do think there is some level of shadiness to deciding to take the first part of your SIL's daughter's name and coming up with something similar to it. Some people do actually care about that and it's really up to you on whether or not you want to potentially upset the peace by doing something like that. There's no reason for your SIL or MIL to berate you for it though. It's just a name and their kid isn't going to be defined by your child's name.
