His sister is getting married soon and she has like 10 events planned. My bf never responds to any of their texts, so they always text me. I barely know these people if at all. I have met this parents and most of his siblings a handful of times. I don\u2019t mind his sister or mom texting me every once in a while to coordinate wedding stuff or just to talk. I have them texting me and messaging me on fb all of the time. Some of his extended family are going to stay with us for the wedding and I have them trying to coordinate with him, he won\u2019t talk to them. I don\u2019t know what to say to them and it is uncomfortable for me to make excuses for him constantly. They ask me questions I don\u2019t the answer to. It feels like a massive waste of energy when he could just reply to his family.\n\nWhen I got home today I had 3 texts from his mother wanting him to call her. I told her I would talk to him and have him call her. I begged him to please start dealing with his family because it is constant and stresses me out. He told me to just ignore them too. I asked him how he thought that would go? Like they won\u2019t like me and I\u2019m not trying to start shit with them and I told him I would never make him deal with my family like that. We got into an argument, a real one. I told him if he didn\u2019t start dealing with them I am just going to reply every time that he didn\u2019t want to speak to them. He said that he was more busy than I am and that he doesn\u2019t want to deal with them all of the time either. He said this is good for our relationships and that they clearly like me. I told him that was such bs and that he is just making excuses. He called me a b and is not speaking to me. More happened but it was just us saying mean things to each other for a couple of hours. I am feeling guilty and like I overreacted. I also think he might be correct that it is good for me to talk to his family. I want us to make up but I am also so tired of dealing with this, but this is probably a small issue in the grand scheme of things.

You are not your boyfriend's assistant lol. \n\nAnd he's the asshole for calling you a bitch. That is intolerable and disrespectful as fuck. And the asshole for behaving like a stupid child.", "NTA please do not fall for the sexist trope that women have to manage the family. May I suggest what I do? Answer the important stuff once a week. And then I also tell my husband (32 years) that his mother is his problem. It isn\u2019t perfect and sure I still get involved. A few of them I even like. But I won\u2019t be the default and I\u2019m not a stand in, either.", "NTA\n\nI would be really bothered by his response. \"He said that he was more busy than I am and that he doesn\u2019t want to deal with them all of the time either.\" Wtf kind of response is that? So, he's more important than you and your time is less valuable so you're responsible for keeping up with his fam? You know this is long term right? How often are you going to have to get multiple calls/messages from his mom asking you to convey she wants to talk?\n\nHe seems wayyyyyyy too comfortable with you as his personal assistant. That doesn't fly with me, but you'll have to decide how willing you are to keep that up, potentially forever. Does that translate to keeping his calendar commitments, doctor appts, and event calendar? Women get put in this role far too often.\n\nIn your position, I'd tell his mom \"that's weird, he was on the phone with his friend earlier today\" or \"he's not responding? I saw an FB post from his phone a couple mins ago\" and never agree to pass along any messages. He needs to handle his own annpyance if he wants his family to keep talking to him.", "This will set the tone for the rest of your relationship.  Stop acting like his secretary.  Redirect all their queries to him.  Play dumb if necessary.  \n\n\"Sorry, you'll have to check with BF on that one\".\n\n\"I'm not sure, you should probably check with BF on that one\".\n\nThis also goes for organising gifts for his side.  His family, his responsibility.  \n\nThey'll be annoyed but that's the price of you not just rolling over and becoming the default social coordinator for his side of the family.\n\n\nYour BF is capable.  He's just content to let you take on the additional mental load because it benefits him.  \n\nI learnt from past mistakes where I somehow ended up as the social coordinator and hated it.  With my husband I didn't get involved from day one.  We are now 8 years in and he still coordinates all things relating to his family, including buying gifts for his mother, family dinners and so on.  \n\nI'm sure they think I'm a bit ditzy because I am always saying some variant of \"I don't know, you should check with husband\" but that's a price I'm happy to pay for peace.", "NTA, not your circus and not your monkeys.  You shouldn't reply for him that's his job", "NTA, and you already had the correct answer. Bf told you to ignore their messages.\n\nWhen they send you any message reply, \"Bf has instructed me to ignore messages from his family. I'm not about to refuse to obey him, so you'll have to take that up directly with him.\"\n\nIt's not a great solution, but it's the one he asked for. Let him and his family settle things.", "Nta. His family is his responsibility not yours. But as the other commenter said, he might not be either. He ignores them and said you could too. I realize you have valid reasons for not liking that solution, but it\u2019s your option.", "This is exactly what happened to me when I first moved in with my partner. His mom would send a group text to all the women in the family to organize events/meals/etc. it was extra ridiculous because I do NOT cook and my partner is an amazing chef so if you're planning a potluck...he's the one who needs to know about it and discuss what everyone is bringing, not me. Finally, I just started adding him into all conversations and not answering for us. Luckily, he also thought it was silly and we were in agreement that he would do the planning/organization for his family events and I would do the same for mine. We're now *both* included on those texts (though his brothers never are) but I don't feel like I have to deal with it because I know he's on it.\n\nIt is not up to you to play secretary for a grown man, especially with his own family!", "NTA \n\nBut your BF might not be either. Is generally less social or does he have actual issues with his family other than him being annoyed? He should think about that before expecting his girlfriend to act as his secretary.", "NTA - this is a great way for you to get to know them, the problem is it shouldn\u2019t be because he wont respond. That is awkward and stressful. \n\nThey very likely know how bad of a communicator he is so start throwing him under the bus and be honest with them. Maybe you can all bond about his poor communication skills.", "Nta, and I hate to say it, but you may be at the end of this relationship.  He's treating you very disrespectfully and if you are going to get past that you need to have a sit down discussion where it's clear him name calling you and treating you like his assistant will not happen again.  If it does, you're done. No third chances.  And he's responsible for his family.", "NTA. Even married women dont want this social chore - dont let your BF get away with it.  Tell him that his family are his problem and stop responding (except maybe to the people who will stay at your house).  Fix this issue now unless you want to break up (I would if someone called me a bitch) or unless you want to do this for the rest of your life.", "NTA... be honest with them. Tell them that you cannot act as go between because he gets grumpy at you when you ask him to respond to his family. \n\nTell BF you will not be his secretary- that you will tell his family the truth if they ask about you.\n\nThis is how the mental load gets transferred.  Refuse to pick up the rope. This is entirely his responsibility.  It is also a sign of what is to come with dealing with household responsibilities.  What have you notice so far?", "You know, the time he spent arguing with you and calling you names, he could have used to call his mother.\n\nUnless there was abuse, there is no reason why he can't speak to his family. He doesn't have to talk for hours, just answer some questions or send a text. And let him coordinate with his family stay who may be staying with you- he needs to take responsibility. \n\nPlease think about what your life would be like if you continue this relationship.", "Nta ignore them like he said too", "NTA\n\nI got trap in that kind of secretary relationship with my MIL years ago. It used to annoy me a lot and my BF used to say the same thing to me: \"Just ignore her\" while not understanding how uncomfortable I was with this idea. I did not want to be his PA nor did I want a bad relationship with my in laws.\n\nMIL thinks it is normal and sane that women in the family are talking to each other about the men. In a managing-their-life kind of way (not my style).\n\nShe's also really anxious and controlling. My BF is not giving her enough, not when she wants nor how she wants it.\n\nIn the end, it soured our relationship. I did not enjoy to talk to her or see her during that period because she was too demanding and became a conflict source between my BF and I.\n\nWell, you know what? I finally took his advise and began to ignore her too. It is not a job. If I am not available (physically, mentally, whatev), I ignored it until I was available for her. Gradually, it got better. I was not feeding her anymore. \n\nActually, my BF and I came to an understanding after I began ignoring his mom. Now, if she stops reaching out to him and try to go through me, it's because he pushed it too far and he needs to take over. And he does (not always happy about it tho but hey, it is HIS mom!).\n\nGood luck with setting boundaries! :)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
