She has kept her clothes from before she lost weight, not really sure why\n\nMe and her go clubbing quite a bit, maybe 2 or 3 times a week and our nights are usually quite expensive. She wanted to cut down because of how much I usually spend on alcohol for her and coke for me but we have a lot of fun so it\u2019s alright. \n\nLast week she told me we need to stop going out like this completely. She said that it\u2019s costing too much and she\u2019s not comfortable with me using drugs anymore either because she\u2019s scared I will become dependent. \n\nI\u2019m completely fine around drugs; nobody in my family had an addictive personality nor do I and I know my limits just like her. I have a very professional job and would never risk it over drugs. I told her this and she didn\u2019t respond.\n\nI also decided to sell her clothes to fund our nights out. They don\u2019t fit her anymore and she has no use for them therefore. I also bought her some of those clothes so I feel like I get a say\n\nMy girlfriend looked in her closet a few days after I put them online and saw that she had none of those clothes.

I read it as the drug at first, but then thought \"nah, no one would actually post about how they're doing coke these days, must be drinking soda\".\n\nNope, they really tried to convince us they don't have a drug problem while doing cocaine.\n\nYTA and if your girlfriend leaving you over your drug habit isn't the wake-up call, then I feel real pity for you, OP.", "That just seems like a incredible take to someone like me who lives in London lol. It's absolutely everywhere here", "coke is actually still big at Hollywood/West Coast parties bc it allows you to stay up later drinking more.

It's amazing to me how much he downplays a hard drug.\n\nHe's got no addition though, because no one in his family has an addictive personality. Didn't ya know that's how drug addiction works? /s\n\nEdit: my bad OP is a woman. A lot of comments I saw also said \"he\" and I missed it in the post, not an unusual thing to happen in this sub.

Things often start out like OP is describing- just on the weekends or a couple times a week, for fun... For me personally, that transitioned into pills on the days I wasn't doing coke. So it became a daily habit easily. Then when the pills dried up, turning to the hard drugs everyday felt like my only option... And I rationalized it because I was making enough money to afford it... I rationalized it because I hadn't hit \"rock bottom\" ...\n\nWell for so many people, rock bottom is death.
