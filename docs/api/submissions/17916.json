We've been planning this trip since February and we were really excited to go on this trip together. BUT here is the problem, a lot of them were struggling with money, and knowing this trip was going to cost a lot, I was willing to chip in more for payment so that way they were comfortable and able to enjoy Paris without worrying about money.\r  \nWe found an Airbnb that was a reasonable price and was close to everything in Paris, the total price of the Airbnb was 2,567.65CAD, with the first down payment being 1,306.59. Since it was 4 of us, the split cost would have been 326.64CAD, but knowing my friends are struggling with money, I was trying to be nice and make them pay me 200CAD. So that means I paid about 599.92CAD while they had it cheaper.\r  \nFast forward a few months, March, one of the girls backed out but told me to keep the money since she did promise to pay, which for her was very mature and kind, I was even willing to give her money back since I know she is struggling but the kindness of her heart allowed me to keep it so I didn't have to spend more out of my pocket.\r  \nNow we are in the Present time, where another girl backed out, after ghosting us for months, not letting us know if she is truly on the trip or not. She kept saying she is waiting on her passport since it's been a few months from applying. We were understanding and just wanted to know if she is down to go so we can book our plane tickets. She made us wait for months with no update.\r  \nNow that is 2 out of 4 not going, knowing I have to pay for college and the second half payment of the Airbnb back to back, I started to stress out over money. So I told the girls we should just cancel and save up for another time. I tried contacting Airbnb to see if I can get a refund of my $1306.64 CAD, for them to tell me I won't get a dime back. Now I am down 1.3k and 2 of the girls are demanding me to refund them their 200 dollars. Logically that's not fair or right IMO. Since I paid more than they did, I was the one that lost the most, and for them to come at me demanding I give them their money back that I didn't get back. I would understand if I got the refund and kept it, but them knowing I didn't get a dime back, and still demanding \"their money\" really has upset me. I explained the situation for them to go \"it's not my problem.\"One of the girls has even threatened to take me to court over a small claim case.\r  \nRight now I'm on the fence, cause I know I'm not in the wrong but them manipulating me by threatening to take me to court has been making me feel like I am in the wrong. After I was being so kind and understanding of their finances, they don't even consider mine. Is it wrong to think if there is no refund, no one gets a refund? If anything they owe me money?

Pretty much like when people say they\u2019re never gonna shop at xyz store again if you don\u2019t comply to their every wish. Also, have you shared your communication that you had with Airbnb to the other girls on the trip? Maybe they think that you received the refund and that you\u2019re trying to pull a fast one on them. Its hard for me to think anyone would expect you to pay them back for money you did not receive back. At least you learned who not to go on future trips with.", "INFO did you tell your friends when you booked that the lodging was non refundable? When the first friend backed out, did you unilaterally decide that she didn\u2019t need to contribute to the second payment or did you ask the others? When the second friend backed out, did you ask the remainers if they were willing to cover her unpaid portion before cancelling the trip? Did you contact the Airbnb host to try for a partial refund? Why did you book lodging so far in advance of plane tickets? What does the timing of your college payment have to do with the timing of a lodging bill you had already committed to paying?", "The only thing I can think of that would make you TA is if you cancelled the trip behind their backs, without telling them no refund. It should have been a discussion when other people\u2019s money is involved. If you said \u201cI can\u2019t afford it anymore, I\u2019m cancelling it.\u201d and did so without waiting for their response, I can see why they\u2019d be really upset to lose money and not get a say in that.\n\nLike, you were being very overly generous for paying more than everyone else. But they still have a right to be upset about their lost money.\n\nNow, I do think if you did discuss with them in advance about the cancellation, they agreed to it, THEN you told them you tried to get a refund and were working on it, they said okay, then you said couldn\u2019t get the refund, you\u2019re not TA. Because it was a mutual discussion and the results of it were out of your control. \n\nBut if at any point you didn\u2019t communicate the lack of refund before the cancellation was final, then its a case of ESH. Theres plenty of alternatives to cancelling it, like rescheduling for a better time when everyone\u2019s finances are in check, or inviting other friends to take the spots of the cancelled friends. So if you cancelled it without ever being open to discussion on these possibilities with your friends, their anger is justified.

If you can't afford it when it's split 3 ways - then give them the option of covering the extra cost now that you're down 1.

Just know that you\u2019re not in the wrong, is there other things you can do to try to get the money back? Possibly. But your friends should be telling you to try these methods and if it\u2019s unsuccessful then you should all take the hit together. It\u2019s not your fault they cancelled.", "I\u2019m sorry but I cannot follow how two girls want refunds but only one is out money. Regardless, yes, life throws curveballs and sometimes we have to make decisions in our own interests but you should also own your impact on other people.", "Then ghost girl is ridiculous. I could understand if she wanted to go and you cancelled, but she backed out making it so now YOU can't go either. Absolutely NTA. \n\nIf the girl who is going wants $200 - she should ask the 2 girls who cancelled, which put the rest of the deposit on you 2 to cover it. They were the ones the essentially lost that deposit for her, not you.", "thank you for taking the time and understand me <3 have a wonderful day", "INFO - Did everyone agree with canceling it before you did so?", "NTA\nand your friends are bad people!", "NTA - they can have an exact proportion of the refund compared to the money they put in vs what was expended in total  - which is still nothing. Let them take you to court.", "NTA. Let them take you to court, the judge will rule against them and you can countersue for the difference in what their portion would be.", "NTA. But unless everyone is absolutely going you should look for a hotel/Airbnb that has a refund policy. People are flaky!", "How will she take you to court if she doesn't have any money? NTA. You didn't get the deposit back so they don't get their deposit back either. It seems so logical....", " NTA.. no-one gets a refund.. they sound very dim", "NTA. \n\nTell her to take you to court. She'll lose and have to pay your legal fees. And then add you'll counter claim for the rest of the money owed. \n\nYou never got a refund. No one gets a refund. \n\nDon't be manipulated. You are in no way in the wrong here. \n\nGet new friends.", "NTA. They are not entitled to a refund. The money was not reimbursed due to cancellation   You even paid the most while giving them a huge discount. Do not give them any money back. They are the ones that canceled", "NTA", "Nta but in the future if you organize trips make it clear once its booked its non-refundable.  So if flaky friends cancel you are not holding the bag.", "NTA lesson learned you can't be nice with people that don't have consideration for you", "NTA the stay was non refundable so they are out of luck. If she wants to go to court, she will lose as soon as the judge hears that it was not refundable.", "YTA You are the one who cancelled.", "NTA. I get their annoyance but damn.", "Info: did the other two also wanna cancel the trip or? Was that kind of your choice?", "NTA\n\nYou are not receiving a refund so there is no money to return.  You are simply cutting your losses, and you lost more than they did.", "NTA you all lost your deposits. Period.", "NTA \u201cthere is no refund, we lost our deposit.\u201d  End of story, find some better friends.", "Yep. I\u2019m the poor friend, I\u2019ve turned nice offers down before because as much as people say \u201coh no it\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll pay for you.\u201d - it\u2019s not and you should worry about it. \n\nIt creates an imbalance in the friendship. The person paying sometimes gets miffed (I paid for X and she won\u2019t do Y). The person who can\u2019t pay feels guilty. It\u2019s just all around not nice feelings for everyone involved.", "considering 2/4 of us cancelled, i talked to the one left and she disagreed for me explaining its so much money to put into now and she said its not her problem. :(", "2 Cancelled on their own choice, one said I can keep the money the other demanded money back, but since its too much just for 2 people to pay for second payment I cancelled", "I'd suggest talking to the property owner, rather than AirB&B. The individual owner is probably more likely to be reasonable than the large corporation managing a few million bookings. We postponed more than one VRBO/AB&B trip this way in '20/'21 (what was going on then? can't remember \\*snicker\\*), and each owner was happy to work with us to schedule a year+ delay to our booking.", "They 100% have a full grasp of the situation. They just don\u2019t care. They want it to come out of yur pocket no matter what your loss is. These girls are not your friends.", "They're idiots. It's not that difficult of a concept to grasp. I'm assuming they do get it, they're just trying to brow beat you into caving. \n\nI'm sorry you had terrible friends, you sound like a nice reasonable human.", "Very true! She doesn\u2019t have to go through with the trip if they can\u2019t find replacements. It was just a suggestion as far avoiding a court case (and losing money unnecessarily) - OP can use her discretion to figure out what works best for her. Either way, I don\u2019t think she owes the 2 girls money.\n\nEDIT: added the stuff in parentheses for clarification", "I have it on reasonable authority that there might be other stuff worth doing in Paris.", "She might have some grounds to argue that she should get reimbursed, since she didn\u2019t want to cancel. \n\nHowever, since she couldn\u2019t even afford a quarter of the down payment, if she couldn\u2019t afford half of the remaining amount then you\u2019d be within your rights to argue that the trip HAD to be cancelled as the other two had broken the verbal agreement to split costs.", "She does not have every right to be mad. She can't afford even her portion of the trip. \n\nParis is an insanely expensive city.", "NTA. This unfortunately is an expensive lesson. Hopefully you can reschedule dates with Airbnb and bring other friends/family. Then these original ones would get their money back. \n\nYou also may want to reconsider these friendships. It\u2019s painful and it sucks \u2639\ufe0f", "You. I like you.", "The oldest house in Paris houses my favorite restaurant in Europe.", "Ooh, they have Nando's in Paris now?"]}
