Your place is much more ideal and more private.", "Info: does he sleep over at your place often?", "NTA. Honestly I feel like him sleeping at your house is a way better option, it\u2019s a bit odd that he can\u2019t see the benefits of your house over his, especially if you\u2019re doing \u2018adult wrestling\u2019. Maybe try and convince him to spend more time at yours and hopefully over time he\u2019ll figure out you have the better living space.", "INFO: how often do you sleep at his place?", "Ew what kind of 27 year old still lives at home? I got the ick just reading that", "NTA. I too would be uncomfortable sleeping in that sort of situation. Maybe he is just jealous that you are living independantly and he is not.", "nah", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth fighting over either.", "Yes. Maybe once a week. I sleep over at his house maybe\u2026 2-3x a month.", "About 2-3x a month", "Money would be a good reason. Or lack of", "Can we all agree this redditor is TA just for this comment alone?", "If anything, the fights would make me less likely to want to stay over! Stick to your boundaries OP- your reasoning is valid and you deserve to get to make whatever choice makes you feel more comfortable.", "Then I am gonna go with NAH.\n\nThe issue is more than just a comfort on your side OP. Your bf is probably a lot more comfortable at his place than he is over at yours (naturally since he lives there).\n\nYour reasons for not going are valid, but you have to learn to compromise here. If he sleeps at your place once a week and you're staying at his place 2 - 3 times a month, try alternating. That way you show your partner you're willing to make this aspect of the relationship work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I also wanted to add here that I see a few people are saying it's probably better for him to be at your place since you live alone and your bed is bigger. Please don't adopt that mindset. It might appear to be ideal but if it was than your bf wouldn't have any issue with you coming over to his place.", "I understand his reasoning.

Who wants to bunk with with an overaged teenager with his parent just down the hall?  It's time for him to launch already!", "yes", "Has he expressed to you why he wants you to sleep over at his place? This might be an issue where you both have a level of comfort issues here.", "He has told me; he works late and doesn\u2019t like driving to my house after a long day. His Xbox and etc are there and he has to unhook it to bring it here. He can\u2019t talk to his family / enjoy time with them when he\u2019s here."]}
