You don't want to feel like you are disrespecting or betraying your bio parents or \"full siblings.\" For teens, it often is harder to come to terms with this. When I was 16, my family became blended to the point all parents ... both bio and step... sat down with us and came up with a plan of action to be a family. We were informed that we were all brothers and sisters and to refer to each other as such. In my case, that meant full, half, step, adopted, and foster siblings were all my brothers and sisters. There was a lot of conversations on how to make our family work. Each household had their own house rules and were enforced. As my mom had full custody of us, in the beginning, the rule was mom enforced physical punishment, and my step-dad didn't physically punish us. His talks with us about how disappointed he was in our behavior was worse than mom chasing us down with the belt. We were a bunch of angry teens who felt like our world was ending. We blamed my step-dad for breaking up our family. Honestly, as an adult, I know it was my biological father who destroyed the marriage with his abusive behavior and alcohol use. My biological father even signed away his parental rights so he wouldn't have to raise us. Our step-dad willingly took me and my two full sisters on and raised 3 of my cousins without \"killing\" us. lol. He didn't have his own kids until my mom had my half-sister three years later. Other foster kids rotated in and out of our family. I called him by his nickname until my late 20s. It wasn't until then that I finally came to terms with everything and realized my step-dad was what a real dad was meant to be and began calling him dad. If I need the advice or comfort of a dad, it is now my step-dad that I call. Is anger going to be there along the way? Sure. Are we all going to make AH moves that we regret? Sure. Your brother's feelings, like your own, are valid. Just because he is struggling with accepting everything doesn't mean that later in life, he won't change how he is currently viewing things. It is important to keep an open line of communication without placing blame. I would advise you to apologize for your actions and ask your brother, sisters, and parents to sit down and create a plan of action in a non-argumentative way. It is okay if not everyone is ready to communicate. It happens that sometimes someone needs to move in with someone else for awhile for a cooling period and to figure out where they truly stand. I think us older three did that for awhile at various points.

He does not have that connection with his new step sisters. His entire life was changed and you all expected him to be ok with it instantly. Which probably made him even more resentful. The best way to handle this is to give him time, REAL time and space. You can\u2019t expect him to just replace the father you grew up with your step father because he cheated. Cheating is horrible. My father cheated on my mother when I was 12 (now 30)and they split. Both parents remarried within a year. I consider some family and some I don\u2019t(on both sides). AND THATS OK. You should really try to talk it out with your brother and see where he is coming from. He is probably hurting a ton and feels incredibly alone. Him going to your fathers was probably to be with someone to feel close to. Ultimately, no one gets to decide who you love, who you consider family, or who you keep in your life.

You view your step father as a fresh breath of air, and he views him as the guy who ruined everything. 3. You have no right to force him into having a relationship with anybody. Simple as that.

There are so many dynamics here.  He's the only boy of the kids, so he may have felt alienated on that.  He being younger may still have dreams that Bio-dad is a good guy.

Just because you've formed strong familial bonds with your stepsisters and your stepfather doesn't mean your brother is obligated to. He is his own person, capable of making his own choices.

Can I ask why you're so upset that your brother doesn't want to call your guys' stepdad \"dad\" and why he doesn't want to call your stepsisters \"sisters\"? Why are you so up in arms about him not forging strong bonds with people who have been \"family\" for only three years?", "Yes, YTA. Your brother had two new people forced into his life.

You threatened to repudiate your blood relative based on something so trivial as how he feels about other people. People ARE complex. You can feel many different emotions towards the same people.

Best thing you can do is best support your mother and your sibling at the same time, but NEVER disown your blood family. \n\nHe will either eventually see things different sooner or later or you should just accept things for what they are. You can not force anyone to like anyone or accept them in their lives. The best you can do as the older sibling is guide your brother to make the right decisions, and be by his side.", "YTA congratulations on chasing your brother away from yourself and your mother, I don't blame him for moving in with his father because I am willing to bet step daddy was harder on him because step daddy does not have a son of his own and saw him as an extension of  your mothers ex-husband, your mother probably will never hear from again and part of that is on her because she let her new husband punish him when she should have been the one to do that, it sounds like he walked away from a hot mess and I say good for him and that he has a happy life away from all of you.", "OP you\u2019re definitely NTA but your brother sure is.", "NTA.  Your brother went to far not you.  He refused to be civil.  \nYour mom wants to have a loving family including her son and she's going to be upset about it for a long time.  Her feelings are very different than yours, she knows he's been a problem for three years but he's still her son and she wants him to be there.", "I\u2019m not making a judgment.  Both you and your brother are still dealing with actions beyond your control.\n\nTo you, your dad is the villain of the piece. He cheated on your mom and destroyed your family.  To your brother, your mom is the villain. She divorced your dad, married someone else, and forced him to move away from your dad.  To me, both of your parents are the villains. Your dad for cheating and your mom for not getting you and your brother the help you needed to process the divorce.  Your brother\u2019s behavior for the last 3 years has been a cry for help and no one has listened to him. Maybe if he had someone to talk to he could have accepted your stepfamily.\n\nAs for you: you seem extremely angry for something that happened at least 3 years ago. That anger and bitterness is not helping you. They\u2019re why you blew up at your brother the way you did. I think the reason you are so mad at your brother is that he challenged the idea that you had this great new family. By refusing to accept your stepfamily, your brother has made it impossible for you to see your family as perfect.  The thing is that no family is perfect.\n\nNeither of you has dealt with the divorce or its aftermath in any real way. The only way forward is to make peace with your past.", "Huh? She was practically an adult (16) when the stepdad came into their lives but then you call the 16 year old brother \u201cstill a child\u201d? I kinda agree with what you say but it\u2019s flawed. 19 is only slightly more mature compared to 16", "Sure, everyone responds and acts differently to situations, but the brothers behavior towards his younger step siblings? Sure, he's young and can't quite process/channel his emotions healthily, still shouldn't get a pass on his behavior. He (probably the whole family) might benefit from some group or individual therapy. I'm gunna go with ESH", "Explain to me how at 16 OP was \"practically an adult\" but get brother, at 16, is a child?", "bro they're 3 yrs apart. be fuckin forreal.", "He's obviously not ready to accept the stepfamily and you are pushing way too hard.", "Also think of it from a boys POV. He gone from 50/50 chance of getting what he wants when your home. To having 100% choice of what to do. \nNow he has 2 other people to contend with when he wants something. \n\nBefore: bro: Mum can we have pizza for dinner?\n              Mum: let me check with your sister. \n                 You: pizza sounds good.\n\nNow: bro: mum can we have pizza for dinner?\n          Mum: sorry no your sisters don\u2019t eat it.", "Can you imagine if the roles were reversed and OP was living the grounded life? Clothes - slutty, behavior - trashy, unacceptable this and that and then your brother says to you \u201coh I don\u2019t understand why you are upset - I\u2019m golden here and you are over reacting \u201c this is the dynamic.\n\nYTA massively", "The brother shouldn't have had to simmer in his resentment as long as he did. Why the heck didn't the mom send him to therapy when it was obvious he was wallowing in anger? What mistaken notions did he have about his bio dad and stepdad? \n\nWhat happens if the brother finds out bio dad is a bio jerk? THEN where does he go?\n\nOP is young and foolish. Her ultimatum was ill-advised.", "how is her brother more of an asshole when she's a grown fucking adult?", "I would agree with her not being able to dictate how hey brother handles any of it. But if he is behaving poorly towards two young girls facing with the same situation he's in and a potentially decent parental figure, disowning him as a brother is valid \n\nNo one has any obligation to keep people with shitty behavior in their life. If you're going to disown someone, telling then why might give them some insight. Perhaps this wasn't done very well though. I get that he's a teen going through some stuff but that's not an excuse to be shitty imo. He needs to get help and see a therapist.", "And frankly I find it odd that OP developed such string attachments so quickly at age 16", "That phrasing doesn\u2019t sit right. Sounds like OP is using her anger to justify invalidating and driving away her brother. A strong YTA here for many reasons.", "One thing that stood out for me was op mentioned they were much better off. I think step dad bought op\u2019s loyalty. Younger brother wants his real family back and is being really horrifically bullied by the step family. Shame on all of them \n\nOP YTA", "I wouldn't be looking for that bone marrow donation...step siblings are notoriously not a match.", "For what it\u2019s worth", "I know OP is only 19 but I'm actually surprised they wrote in to AITA.  I mean this sub is full of parents telling teenagers, \"You are now a loving part of this blended family whether you like it or not!\"  And this sub universally and rightfully calls them an AH.\n\nDid OP think that because they are an older sibling and not a parent that they would not be called an AH?\n\nI fully agree that self reflection is not strong in this one.", "Also... Sperm donors don't do custody, which is what it sounds like their father is doing. If their/his father is willing to be an active participant in sons life you can't call them donors.", "> Materialistic much?\n\nIt does seriously come across as trying to overcompensate with her new stepfather because he is well off. I kind of wonder if he's the one paying for her schooling.", "<<Materialistic much?>>\n\nI don't think we have enough information to make that judgement.\n\nAt 16, it is very possible that OP was aware of money problems that Mother was having that a 13 yr old was not.\n\nWe don't know if Bio-dad is/was a deadbeat dad.  Don't know if they were on welfare/snap/, living in lousy housing.  If they were food/housing insecure.  \n\nIt is possible that OP saw the benefit/change and the stress that it took off her mother.", "Well you see, women are adults at 15 and men are babies until they're in their 30s. Hope this helps.", "They are 2 different people, how they react to divorce/remarry will not be the same. It sounds like because her brother doesn\u2019t grovel at step family\u2019s feet like OP does he\u2019s considered disrespectful? We don\u2019t know if step family has done anything to earn his respect", "Probably because she finally got sisters she's always wanted.", "How long has it been since the divorce?", "So you\u2019re doing the same thing as your brother. You\u2019re taking out your parents marriage issues on someone else. You on your father and he in his step father. You both have issues from it. Understandable. Your dad didn\u2019t cheat on you, but it\u2019s perfectly understandable to be angry anyway. You don\u2019t have to forgive him and it\u2019s great you developed a relationship with your step father, but that doesn\u2019t mean your brother has to. You\u2019re trying to dictate his feelings. You want him to hate your dad and love your step dad but sorry, he\u2019s his own person. Being alienated and yelled at to accept them is only going to push him away. If you\u2019re so angry on your mother behalf, realize you\u2019re making it worse for her by trying to alienate her son from the family.", "He may have cheated, but as far as i can see he's the only one not treating your brother as garbage.", "Quite frankly, that is none of your business. What occurs between a married couple simply stays between that married couple until and unless it degenerates into abuse. You don't know what was going through your fathers mind, you don't know what led to that situation occurring. And even if it was just propinquity, it's still none of your business and it has nothing to do with how you've treated your brother, or how his new step family has treated him, or how your mother and brother have reacted.", "So it's okay to punish the boy not to bow down and kiss everyone's ass? Op attitude is far more terrible I'm glad the boy was old enough to vacate himself from mental abuse from this bunch.", "She doesn\u2019t understand that he was a bad husband, not a bad father. His cheating on her mom has nothing to do with her. She needs to figure that out and stop trying to replace him. He will forever and always be her dad.\n\nI find it disgusting that someone so old would disrespect their father the way she does to him, even if he did cheat on her mom.", "I asked op how long it's been since the divorce, because everything seems so tidy in all of this.", "I could speculate that OP being so vindictive is redirected distaste for their father. \"Bio dad's a cheating slimeball\" \"If that's the company he wants then good riddance\"\n\nAgain it would take less effort on her part to still hate the father and not actively push her brother towards him like she is doing now...It's disheartening how much she is hurting her new family and her mom by being so fixated on forcing the issue.", "Yes, and her brother is now moving back to a less financially well off situation as he'd prefer it. He isn't being bought off by material possessions.\n\nI wonder what the brother is also dealing with as he lives in the house 24/7 while she only seems to visit.", "A deadbeat wouldn't support the kid moving back, they avoid any responsibilities including custody. Also OP is so hell bent in making herself look the morally right that I'm sure she would be open if the situation was this bad or if stepdad was this awesome.\n\n\nInstead, the only thing she gave to say is \"stepdad have money so idk why he's unhappy\". You're giving OP way too much credit when nothing in her post shows this level of maturity.", "honestly theres no guarantee there was that long of a dating period or that the families were allowed to get used to eachother first. Ive seen single parents jump to moving in and marrying in a few months.", "It's not normal to misbehave all the time at age 13. And you're not an adult with 16 either.", "I had much harder time accepting kids before the age of 17 ironically. Afterwards, i love kids.", "We are only getting on version of this dynamic  Op's version they very could have been using punishment to get the boy to basically bow down and kiss everyone's feet we don't know", "It literally says in the post that the brother was grounded for most of two years. The fuck did he do to deserve that? Because the reason op gave isn't good enough. It's obvious his mum and step dad are abusing their authority so I can see why he dislikes them. He's not an asshole. He's having a perfectly normal reaction to someone in his situation.", "And the stepdad's money, don't forget that.", "Or her new daddy bribed her with something.", "If she really loved brother she would put him in therapy instead of let stepdad keep grounding the kid til he snapped and went back to their dad.", "I know, most people I know don\u2019t use that term lightly: one of my aunts privately calls her bio father \u2018that man\u2019 because he SAed her and her sisters. A friend calls her child\u2019s father a sperm donor because he took advantage of her and then threatened their lives causing her to move far away to protect them from him.", "Eh, I think that it\u2019s okay for an adult child to cut contact with their parent for cheating. Affairs hurt families. OP doesn\u2019t owe her dad a relationship, and her feelings are just as valid as her brother\u2019s when it comes to who they consider their real family.", "How much you wanna bet that bro looks like dad?", "If my brother acted like that I would do the same exact thing this isn't about the asshole brother not bowing down it's been three years and he referred to them as mother's husband and daughters of mother's husband father and from the sound of it was planning on cutting them out of his life as soon as he moved out Everything that happened to him he put on himself.", "I'm wondering how much the step dad and bio mom is forcing the boy to call him dad are they trying to erase bio dad. And this is the reason why the boy is fighting back. We are only getting on version here Op's version and she like is because step dad has money", "If he no longer has to pay court ordered child support, he might.", "Wow, that would definitely be a difficult adjustment for some kids!", "I agree, definitely not normal to misbehave all the time. Understandable that he would have difficulties being reprimanded by a \u201cnew dad\u201d that was forced upon him. It\u2019s a tricky situation", "My guess that while OP slid into the \"perfect family\" blend mode.  Brother did not and was harangued to be one of the family.  We've seen other reddits here where kids were nagged and bullied about calling stepdad dad and \"bonding\" with siblings.  To be fair a 13 yr old teenage boy isn't going to magically bond with  6 & 10 yr \"sisters\" easily.", "Probably bought op with a car or college", "He's better off out of the house having to endure crap from Op she loves step daddy because he has money. And I wonder if the step father and mother and Op was trying to erase bio dad. She called him the sperm donor. Your only getting one version of this we have no idea how the boy was treated in the beginning was he punished because he didn't cave to them or not wanting to erase dad", "Honestly it's amazing she's embraced them as her family so lovingly. It's horrific how she's treated her brother who has a very realistic and common view of his step family, though. Step parents aren't parents and step siblings aren't siblings. Loving them as parents and siblings is 100% okay (and fantastic) but recognizing the difference and keeping that boundary is just fine. I can't believe OP was allowed to behave like this over a normal boundary. The comments he made are also awful but honestly not surprising if this is how the past couple of years have been.", "Yeah but your wife doesn't live with her step-siblings now lmao. It was only once I moved out that I was capable of not actively hating my step-siblings and step-mom because I finally felt like I had a degree of control over my life again. After my dad dies I'll absolutely never see them for Christmas again because I STILL resent how dramatically our traditions changed in order to basically just do their traditions. I'm civil and friendly and cordial now, but it's entirely for my dad's sake.", "My point is, we have no info to make assumptions about him being a bad father - but we do have to judge the mother and stepfather. Create all different scenarios where \"it could have been\" doesn't erase the fact that this poor kid spend two whole years, in a new city where he doesn't have friends or hobbies, grounded and excluded from activities because he wouldn't call his stepfather \"dad\"... the bio dad is not the problem.", "Not just new dad/new siblings but new town/new friends.\n\nHis whole life was uprooted.", "I mean causing a hard divorce because you can\u2019t keep it in your pants long enough to file for divorce does not scream good father to me", "Or the brother was younger and didn\u2019t understand what the father did. All he saw was his mother marrying a stranger and moving them away, making her the bad guy instead of the actual bad guy, the cheating father.", "The sperm donor was a cheater and the boy doesn't have to love the family if he so chooses but he is disrespectful to everyone and it's been three years he's had plenty of time to adjust", "Also the fact it's been only 3 years. That isn't much time at all for him to adjust in the middle of so much else that's happened in life *current events included *.\n\nI feel so sorry for the boy.", "Great point! That\u2019s a huuuuge amount of change for someone just entering their teen years", "And OP apparently went away to college, so she not part of the day to day life anymore. I vote YTA because you can\u2019t force someone to feel, and act how you want them to. This is especially true a kid barely a teenager, who\u2019s  had to adjust to a lot of changes.", "Yes the \"sperm donor \" was a cheater but how was mom and step dad towards the boy in the beginning. Did they want or force the boy to say step daddy is his new daddy and to never speak to his bio dad. Did step dad's money have anything to do with how Op is towards him. And if the boy is disrespectful is everyone forcing the boy in a corner is it step dad's house step dad's rules he is new dad real dad nor bio dad. Is the boy third class because step dad's daughters and princess Op. Also is there any custody or did step dad's influence have any say in this"]}
