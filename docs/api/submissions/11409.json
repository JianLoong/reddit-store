When I was 16, my family became blended to the point all parents ... both bio and step... sat down with us and came up with a plan of action to be a family. We were informed that we were all brothers and sisters and to refer to each other as such. In my case, that meant full, half, step, adopted, and foster siblings were all my brothers and sisters. There was a lot of conversations on how to make our family work. Each household had their own house rules and were enforced. As my mom had full custody of us, in the beginning, the rule was mom enforced physical punishment, and my step-dad didn't physically punish us. His talks with us about how disappointed he was in our behavior was worse than mom chasing us down with the belt. We were a bunch of angry teens who felt like our world was ending. We blamed my step-dad for breaking up our family. Honestly, as an adult, I know it was my biological father who destroyed the marriage with his abusive behavior and alcohol use. My biological father even signed away his parental rights so he wouldn't have to raise us. Our step-dad willingly took me and my two full sisters on and raised 3 of my cousins without \"killing\" us. lol. He didn't have his own kids until my mom had my half-sister three years later. Other foster kids rotated in and out of our family. I called him by his nickname until my late 20s. It wasn't until then that I finally came to terms with everything and realized my step-dad was what a real dad was meant to be and began calling him dad. If I need the advice or comfort of a dad, it is now my step-dad that I call. Is anger going to be there along the way? Sure. Are we all going to make AH moves that we regret? Sure. Your brother's feelings, like your own, are valid. Just because he is struggling with accepting everything doesn't mean that later in life, he won't change how he is currently viewing things. It is important to keep an open line of communication without placing blame. I would advise you to apologize for your actions and ask your brother, sisters, and parents to sit down and create a plan of action in a non-argumentative way. It is okay if not everyone is ready to communicate. It happens that sometimes someone needs to move in with someone else for awhile for a cooling period and to figure out where they truly stand.

My father cheated on my mother when I was 12 (now 30)and they split. Both parents remarried within a year. I consider some family and some I don\u2019t(on both sides). AND THATS OK. You should really try to talk it out with your brother and see where he is coming from. He is probably hurting a ton and feels incredibly alone. Him going to your fathers was probably to be with someone to feel close to. Ultimately, no one gets to decide who you love, who you consider family, or who you keep in your life.

I would kind of brush it off though and try to support my mom and tell my siblings to relax here and there. \n\nNow that they are almost 20F and 18M they have matured a little bit and have appreciated step dad for all he has done these past years. They don\u2019t argue with him or complain about him as much as they used too. It used to be really bad.

Materialistic much?\n\nYeah, maybe OP's little brother missed his dad who continued to fight to remain his father and clearly loves him. It's almost as though OP's little brother missed his dad and resents his mom and \"shiny new dad\" for trying to alienate him from his actual dad. Go figure.\n\n>  \n>  \n>A preteen who had to move home, towns, schools, move into a house that he shares with 3 new people - but hey Stepdad has more money so he should be happy.\n\nMakes you wonder about OP's priorities. \n\n>  \n>  \n>I wonder what the comparison was from his previous life to his new life - what else he may have lost out on?  Did he and his mother move into stepdad's existing house after the marriage where he got a downgraded bedroom because stepdad couldn't possibly ask his daughters to be inconvenienced.\n\nAnd let's not forget, how much was OP's dad having to downgrade the home OP and her brother shared with their actual father because of the increased \"child support\" he had to pay when their mom moved them away. (Yeah, the system is screwed up, she should never be allowed to uproot the kids like that).", "And it could also be they are both girls so now he is \"outnumbered\" by bio sister and stepsisters. Like, do the parents do anything just with him or that he prefers? Or is it all about the girls?", "Because people here wanna demonize one and not the other.", "And was he mistaken? Someone can do something inexcusable like cheating, but that doesn't mean any response to it is justified, and it doesn't mean they can't be redeemed. Cheating doesn't carry a death sentence in the western world, last I heard. I'd take a father who was great 99% of the time who cheated over a father who was shitty 99% of the time but hey at least he didn't cheat", "Because I'd made the mistake (oops) of assuming that the blended family was as welcoming to the boy as to the three girls.\n\nOP has had little to say about brother's experience, other than that he's spent a lot of time grounded.", "This \"decent parental figure\" has grounded him for 2 years in an important social time in his life, when you can be permanently stunted by not being able to grow. I dont care if that person is a saint in all other aspects, it's unlikely brother deserves that length of grounding.", "And a lot of daughters are closer to their mothers while sons are closer to their fathers.  So OP was willing to trade her \"sperm donor\" in for one who would buy her a car because she got to keep her mother and scored two bonus sisters.  Whereas her brother gained nothing but judgment and pressure, just lost.  YTA.  I hope your brother recovers from what you, your mother, and his new family have done to him.", "You\u2019re 19.

Your stepfather is not a saint. Grow up. \n\nYou were cruel to your brother.", "If your mother and you are anything alike I can see why your father cheated YTA", "I appreciate it Twat", "It's really not. OP's relationship to her steps can be vastly different to her brother's relationship to them. Plus, she sneers openly at her brother's relationship with *their* bio-dad. She seems to think both her and her brother should fawn over the stepfamily.", " It's obvious his mum and step dad are abusing their authority so I can see why he dislikes them. He's not an asshole.", "If steps haven't been welcoming, then brother is, of course, fully justified.", "\nI wonder what the comparison was from his previous life to his new life - what else he may have lost out!!!", "I read the sperm donor comment as an insult, not literal truth. She calls him sperm donor because he lost the right to be called father in her eyes", "That isn\u2019t what they meant. How old are you? Genuinely asking and not trying to be a dick. What OP said isn\u2019t truth and was meant to be an insult. I\u2019ve heard it used many times in my life so I didn\u2019t know if maybe it\u2019s cause you\u2019re too young or older.", "Also, while it may absolutely not be the case here, some parents, especially moms, will overshare with their children-particularly older ones-things they should never be exposed to. As OP refers to dad as \u201cbio dad\u201d, \u201ccheating slime ball\u201d, etc, I have to wonder if mom didn\u2019t put some of those bugs in her ear causing her to have different feelings toward dad than brother has (though I\u2019m sure age may have also played a role, with OP understanding more, even unspoken)", "i think it's also important to note that OP's brother went from being the youngest kid to a middle child, and now with OP not living with her parents he's in the \"oldest child\" position.  Your place among siblings honestly does have psychological affects.  Among one is that previously as the younger child he was probably more being pushed along to keep up with his sister.  Or he could have been indulged more as the youngest and only boy in their mom/daughter/son relationship.   Now in the oldest child position, he could be held back instead and told to be on his step-sisters' level.  You know, \"you can't do this if the girls can't\" or \"you can take the car to go to the mall but you have to take your sisters and keep an eye on them\".   Likely, this kid is all out of sorts and confused.  Honestly, it would be interesting to hear from him on this issue!!    \n\nHe's also the only boy with 3 sisters/step-sisters.   He's outnumbered.  Some people can embrace that.  Some people don't mesh with that at all, especially when it's sprung on you during puberty.   \n\nAnd, the brother is allowed to just not like them.  Sometimes we don't like our blood family.  As made clear by OP and her relationship with her bio father.", ">Well you see, women are adults at 15 and men are babies until they're in their 30s. Hope this helps.\n\nI'm older than that and I'm still a big kid at heart.", "If he was keeping his feelings to himself, that would be the case. But constantly telling your step siblings you hate them? Come on, he\u2019s an asshole. OP did nothing wrong. I swear this whole sub has serious mommy issues. Not every step parent is an evil step parent.", "It\u2019s been years, they\u2019re not exactly new anymore. Being 16 doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to be a dick to your family members.", "The brother here could absolutely be a brat. However, in my own life I've seen, repeatedly, the mixed family dynamic play out completely differently across genders. Step-daughters tend to get integrated much better than step-sons, whose presence in the house is something between tolerated and hostile.\n\nThe former's not even always positive. One of my nieces, a huge introvert, was basically forced into an older sister role for her step-siblings. Everyone assumed because she's a girl that she'd automatically love her new younger sisters and want them shadowing her 24/7, borrowing her clothes, etc. Blech.", "A lot of kids actually love their mothers and don\u2019t like to see their mothers heartbroken? I\u2019m confused why the OG cause of the family\u2019s split is being treated with such respect?", ">She doesn\u2019t understand that he was a bad husband, not a bad father.\n\nIf he was a good father to her, I don't think she would feel this way towards him. Regardless of the cheating. This post leaves a lot to be assumed.", ">I could speculate that OP being so vindictive is redirected distaste for their father. \"Bio dad's a cheating slimeball\" \"If that's the company he wants then good riddance\"  \n>  \n>Again it would take less effort on her part to still hate the father and not actively push her brother towards him like she is doing now...It's disheartening how much she is hurting her new family and her mom by being so fixated on forcing the issue.\n\nKeep in mind, the mom moved OP and her brother away from their actual father, and made her new husband with more money \"shiny new dad\", and it looks like OP's has either had to, or has decided to take sides in whatever conflict the parents had that led to their divorce...it has her pretty twisted. This new step family has only been there for about 3 years according to OP, yet OP chooses them over her 16 year old little brother that she's known all of his life, since she was 3. That's pretty dang cold.", "And it seems they likely share OP's negative attitude towards his biological father. If the stepfather was trying to replace the biological father, no wonder things went south.", "Let's not forget, the mom moved them away from their dad so they could have their new shiny \"new dad\", y'know, because parental alienation was only incidental. The way she refers to her father as \"sperm donor\" and such...when it's apparent that he was still an involved father makes it pretty clear what's really going on here. The mom involved the kids in her conflict with their dad, and OP took the mom's side. Parental alienation is child abuse, and OP's issues make it pretty clear why that is.", "My intent was to say as much... Since her bio father is clearly taking custody of her brother he is more than a sperm donor, so clearly OP is operating at a high bias against him to use such language. Clearly was phrased poorly, apologies for any churn!\n\nPS, I am very sorry for how OP appears to have been hurt by her father's actions, but she needs to know that her brother has a right to process how he wants. Loving someone despite their massive, crushing mistakes and failings is okay. I would say hating them is too, but ultimately hate hurts you more than the hated. I hope she can work through her pain to a place that is safe for her with the boundaries appropriate for her.", "Nah you're trying to be a dick. It's a pretty innane comment meant to point out OPs operating bias and you're making it a thing.

His mom and sister will be lucky if they ever see him again.", "Yeah you'd just be like who dose this asshole think he is haha, he shouldn't have the right to discipline and target him so much, sounds kinda abusive to me.
