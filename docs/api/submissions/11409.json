You don't want to feel like you are disrespecting or betraying your bio parents or \"full siblings.\" For teens, it often is harder to come to terms with this. When I was 16, my family became blended to the point all parents ... both bio and step... sat down with us and came up with a plan of action to be a family. We were informed that we were all brothers and sisters and to refer to each other as such. In my case, that meant full, half, step, adopted, and foster siblings were all my brothers and sisters. There was a lot of conversations on how to make our family work. Each household had their own house rules and were enforced. As my mom had full custody of us, in the beginning, the rule was mom enforced physical punishment, and my step-dad didn't physically punish us. His talks with us about how disappointed he was in our behavior was worse than mom chasing us down with the belt. We were a bunch of angry teens who felt like our world was ending. We blamed my step-dad for breaking up our family. Honestly, as an adult, I know it was my biological father who destroyed the marriage with his abusive behavior and alcohol use. My biological father even signed away his parental rights so he wouldn't have to raise us. Our step-dad willingly took me and my two full sisters on and raised 3 of my cousins without \"killing\" us. lol. He didn't have his own kids until my mom had my half-sister three years later. Other foster kids rotated in and out of our family. I called him by his nickname until my late 20s. It wasn't until then that I finally came to terms with everything and realized my step-dad was what a real dad was meant to be and began calling him dad. If I need the advice or comfort of a dad, it is now my step-dad that I call. Is anger going to be there along the way? Sure. Are we all going to make AH moves that we regret? Sure. Your brother's feelings, like your own, are valid. Just because he is struggling with accepting everything doesn't mean that later in life, he won't change how he is currently viewing things. It is important to keep an open line of communication without placing blame. I would advise you to apologize for your actions and ask your brother, sisters, and parents to sit down and create a plan of action in a non-argumentative way. It is okay if not everyone is ready to communicate. It happens that sometimes someone needs to move in with someone else for awhile for a cooling period and to figure out where they truly stand. I think us older three did that for awhile at various points.

He does not have that connection with his new step sisters. His entire life was changed and you all expected him to be ok with it instantly. Which probably made him even more resentful. The best way to handle this is to give him time, REAL time and space. You can\u2019t expect him to just replace the father you grew up with your step father because he cheated. Cheating is horrible. My father cheated on my mother when I was 12 (now 30)and they split. Both parents remarried within a year. I consider some family and some I don\u2019t(on both sides). AND THATS OK. You should really try to talk it out with your brother and see where he is coming from. He is probably hurting a ton and feels incredibly alone. Him going to your fathers was probably to be with someone to feel close to. Ultimately, no one gets to decide who you love, who you consider family, or who you keep in your life.
