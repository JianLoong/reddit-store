This is similar for all the women in my family. Genetics, man.", "Because like men, women often find men visually attractive when they are wearing clean, new, sexy clothes to bed. This woman is pushing too hard, but is most likely saying, \"hey isn't our sexual relationship important enough to ditch those comfy but unattractive shorts?\"", "I've had clothes since the 8th grade that still fit and are still in good condition.  Boots too.  \n\nSorry you had crappy clothing but good quality stuff, and maintaining it well, lasts longer", "Idk I had some Adidas track pants that I wore nearly every night for like 8 years, and I swear they looked as good as the day I bought them by the time someone stole them.  The elastic seemed fine too", "Who cares If they don't fit perfectly. He's fucking sleeping in them not going to ball lmao", "Oh god. You just made me feel so old, like the Clinton administration was this crazy long time ago.....", "i fail to see how any of that is actually relevant. he's sleeping, not going to a wedding or funeral.\n\nNTA", "Reverse the genders and then think about if your answer would be the same.", "She kicks him out of the bedroom for his choice of sleepwear? Seems quite extreme, and ridiculous.", "I agree. The only way to even feign objectivity in this is if the evidence is presented.", "Even if they are ugly, who fucking cares. I'm not with my partner because they chose to wear clothes their mom gave them as a kid when he's sleeping. \n\nIt's a non issue. She needs to grow up.", "So what if he is? They're HIS shorts. Why should he have to throw them away just because his wife \"thinks they're ugly\"? He's in bed for crying out loud. How big a deal can it possibly be?", "I don't need a picture I need to smell them. ! Clothes that have been worn frequently for years start to get a stink that just doesn't go away. Growing up I always associated that smell with my dad's dresser and thought it was just a him thing. Till I realized the comfiest PJ shirt I had started to smell exactly the same. Even after stripping it and soaking in vinegar and all that, the \"this has been well loved for many many years\" smell just never left. Since then Ive had other PJs meet the same fate. Same thing happens to my husband's work shirts. Doesn't matter if the seams are still holding up or how often you wash them, after so long that smells gonna set it. The difference is some go nose blind to it and some don't. I can't imagine shorts that have been worn 13 years haven't also taken on the smell.", "When my grandpa passed, you could read a newspaper through his two favorite shirts. But my grandma could not get him to part with them.", "INFO, OP do you have any mommy issues and you need to wear something, all the time, that your mom bought for you?", "I question how a 13 year old pair of shorts being washed hundreds of times are still in good condition.  I mean for 4 years his wife has been asking him to get rid of them. 100% the elastic will be no longer stretchy , they will have faded,  and be absolutely shapeless .A seam has split or there will be some fraying as well. The wife is sick of the sight of them..\n\nMake an effort dude and buy some new kit. My ex used to do this. He'd buy a single shirt or  pair of jeans and wear them repeatedly until they fell apart. It drove me nuts, particularly when he'd have a shower and then put in the same clothes he wore the previous day .", "Pretty sure they're gnarly.", "At this point, I can guarantee the wife would take a new Speedo over some nasty-ass, old ass gym shorts.", ">you married an abuser\n\nYall always take this shit way too far.", "My ex husband had what they used to call a smoking jacket that his mom made when he was a young adult. It's like a blazer length robe, something comfy to wear at home. Some people called them lounging jackets.It was wearing thin after 14 or 15 years and  I asked did he mind if I made him a new one. I borrowed her pattern to make it. He loved the new one, but never gave up the old one. He wore the new one if we had people over, the old one for everyday. I later made him a fancy one and he loved that one too. \nI really don't understand why this is an issue. But then, I comecfrom a long line of peeps that gang on to comfy clothing. I have two old sweatshirts with stains and paint and the sleeves cut short. I wear the when I'm cold. I think sometimes about replacing them, but the materials aren't the same anymore. For all I know my ex still has his original lounging jacket. It would be 60 years old by now.", "maybe he was a fat kid", "It's like he's in an immatuee argument with his 5 who he wants to annoy, not his wife, who he should love.", "Sometimes things really are that asinine actually.", "Yeah, the actual issue is that he's bad in bed and refuses to put any effort into getting better.", "Agreed. Even when it seems like a small thing, it's probably not really...\n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/she-divorced-me-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink_b_9055288", "It kinda weird.  Because while \"please don't wear gross thing in the bed we share\" is reasonable, op says she doesn't...how they look?  When they are under the covers?\n\nOp, don't throw out the shorts.  Wear them on lazy Saturdays or when you work out, or play sports....but not wearing them in bed beside her every single night is a pretty fair ask", "There's clothes that aren't sexy and there's clothes that are repulsive and by OP's own account, these shorts fall into the latter category for his wife.", "This!!! Baggy t-shirt and shorts is standard. It doesn't matter what you wear to bed. Seriously comfort for bed matters more, for both genders.", "\u201cThrowaway account\u201d\n\u201cNot their real names\u201d", "If my husband/wife insisted on sleeping with a baby blanket or stuffed animal in bed every night, regardless of wanting to have sex or not, yeah I would not be that happy with the arrangement. It's bringing childhood into the place where romance and sex should be at least an option.", "Damn that was a reach", "that's a good shirt!  But honestly it even if it had holes...it's your damn shirt \ud83d\udc83", "Why is everyone assuming OP is speaking in bad faith?  I own shorts I've had for over a decade that are still fine.", "I still wear clothes I got new during the original Bush administration as well as Clinton's, so I hear you!\n\nThe decades, they fly by...", "Give those shorts a nice deep sniff and tell me again it's a non issue.", "He shouldn't have to throw them out, but he should stop lying to himself lol. There is zero chance that those shorts are in the great condition he claims. He should just own it. \"Honey, they're my shorts and I don't care if you don't like them. If you can't stand to sleep in the same room as them, I'll miss you while you're on the couch.\"", "Yeah as long as he's in the privacy of his own home and understands that his wife doesn't find him attractive when he wears them then he should just wear them if he wants. I'm sure he doesn't like every article of clothing she wears either.", "You do realize people do other things in bed besides sleep, right?", "4 yrs.", "The fuck we don\u2019t lmao", "True.   \ud83e\udd2d", "No they're really not. The big blowout I had with my ex-girlfriend that was the end of our relationship was at her grandfather's funeral over a key lime pie. It wasn't *really* about a key lime pie. I doubt this fight is *really* about a pair of shorts.\n\nIt's about what the shorts represent. A 26 year old man can do all the grownup thing; buy a car, open a credit card, go to a bar, get married, and have kids. But he's still holding onto things from his teenage years. \n\nIt makes me ask questions like what else is he doing? Playing videogames for hours on end every night while she does the shopping, cooks dinner, and does dishes and laundry? I don't know for sure, I'm just guessing. But I do believe that there's way more to this story than just a pair of shorts.", "They aren\u2019t clean 2/3 of the time. \ud83e\udd22", "Especially someone he presumably wants to have sex with him.", ">.how they look?  When they are under the covers?\n\nBecause she, presumably, wants to have sex with him.", "Unless he\u2019s lying about them not being ratty or smelly, there\u2019s no reason she should be \u201crepulsed\u201d by gym shorts, a super normal sleep clothes of men everywhere", "100%", "[removed]", "\"nice pajamas, Simpson! Who bought them for you? Your MOMMY??\"\n\n\"...Well yeah, who else would have bought them for me?\"\n\n\".....you win this round, Simpson!\"", "Agree, it doesn't matter who bought them", "It would be weird if you want to have sex with your wife but are wearing emotional support shorts that you won't allow her to replace, because then they won't be from your mother.", "Jesus Christ, THANK you. What the hell world am I living in? He's worn the same shorts to bed every fucking night! A pair his wife has told him she doesn't like! If my wife told me she doesn't really like something I have, then I say, \"Huh, interesting. Good to know\" and then I don't wear that anymore. Because I want my wife to think I'm attractive. And I work hard to make it that way. Why the hell would I hold onto 13 year old shorts? God, that shit is gross.", "\u2018Throwaway account because my \u2018whoever\u2019 follows this sub\u2019 and then goes on to detail very specific events that would absolutely be instantly recognizable to their \u2018whoever\u2019\n\n\u2018AITA when I\u2019m obviously overwhelmingly the most compelling and sympathetic victim and everyone in my life is similar to YA werewolf story level antagonists\u2019 \n\nOr conversely,\n\n\u2018AITA when I\u2019m obviously the devil himself\u2019s evil, twisted twin who asked if I\u2019m the AH but will proceed to argue with anyone saying I am and somehow, in a breathtaking feat, will prove myself to be even more heinously horrendous in the comments\u2019", "Wow I hope you never date someone who gets attached to any specific things or has \u201cchildish\u201d likes, hobbies, or collections.\n\nWould you expect them to toss a blanket over their display cases and remove all the family pictures from the room before naked fun time?  Shove the nightstand they\u2019ve owned since they were a teen into the hall?\n\nAlso, I am guessing that OPs sleep shorts have little to do with his naked fun time.  Since he doesn\u2019t wear them under daytime clothes or date clothes and most people remove sleep shorts to have sex if the sexy times start after they\u2019re already ready to sleep.", "You seriously think he's washing his shorts every three days? His wife is doing the laundry.", "Right like, if they\u2019re in great condition after 13 years of nightly wear, I\u2019m gonna need to know the brand because that\u2019s amazing", "Because a lot of those are about jealously of girlfriends wearing skimpy clothing in public, wanting them to change their entire style or grooming, wanting things that take significant effort or cost, etc. And honestly, I have seen women told that they're not entitled to their partner's attraction for things like gaining weight, getting a tattoo or not styling their hair to his preferences. \n\nInsisting on wearing a specific pair of ancient clothing that she doesn't like *every night* when there are probably plenty of shorts in the world that are equally comfortable is much less reasonable, imo.", "Don\u2019t even have to look back too far - [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Ffwf6BmH1g) was today and the man was near unanimously the AH and called insecure, abusive and controlling for not wanting his wife to wear shorts showing her butt cheeks while out in public with their children.

Take good care of your clothes, reinforce and repair them when needed. Something like pants can last a lifetime if you maintain them well", "I guess I just don't think who bought someone something. \n\nI could possibly see if it was an anniversary gift from an ex or something.

Just recognize that your shorts are not good.", "Omg I just LOLLED so hard", "I doubt she doesn't like them because they aren't sexy. She probably doesn't like them because they're old, full of holes, and don't fit. There is no way that a pair of shirts that have been washed multiple times a week for 13 years are still in good shape, and I'd be surprised if a pair of shorts made for a young teenage boy also fit a 26 year old man.", "But again, its to sleep in.  Why do you care what someone else sleeps in.  For sexy time? Sure.  But my guess is they aren't having sex every night", "I don't care that much, but maybe they're just ratty and she hates them? If he's been wearing them every night for 13 years and washing them at least twice a week, they probably look awful. She might just think he deserves a new pair of shorts to sleep in instead of a pair that he's been wearing since he was a teenager.       \n\nBut it sounds like he wears them every night, so it would be hard to get into sexy time in those shorts. Men don't usually have lingerie, but wearing old shorts isn't going to turn anyone on."]}
