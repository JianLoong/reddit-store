Set your boundaries and make them very clear.", "NTA!  Its completely unreasonable for her to have invited and apparently assured HER coworkers who you have never met that they could stay at your residence, presumably for free, while traveling, before she even approached you about it.  \n\nIt would be ok if she asked you first before mentioning anything to her coworkers and then respected whatever your decision was, but she did it totally out of order.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA.

Hopefully she won't do it again.", "NTA, it's rude as hell to invite someone to use SOMEONE ELSE'S place and stuff.
