You have every right to be upset", "NTA. She absolutely should have asked first and it is inconsiderate to bring several people over to stay at your house.", "NTA. That's a very rude thing your friend has done. I most certainly would not have told her it was fine. It wasn't fine, she has no right to invite other people to stay at your place, without even asking you first.", "NTA. It's incredibly rude to invite people over to stay at somebody else's home without that person's buy-in. It just isn't done and it isn't ok.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s very disrespectful to the host. She didn\u2019t talk to you BEFORE making promises. You felt cornered. I suggest setting boundaries to keep your friendship, if you want to keep it.\n\nI understand where you\u2019re coming from. I host a lot at my apartment. My guests NEVER bring anyone if I don\u2019t have knowledge of it or approve of. It\u2019s just courtesy.", "NTA. \n\n>I just feel like she should\u2019ve asked me first before promising anything to anyone.\n\nYou don't mention how old you are, but seriously tell her this *to her face*. She needs to grow up. Asking for forgiveness, not permission is a surefire way to lose friends fast.", "You need to say no. Out loud. To her. It should be interesting to see if she respects your \"no\". That will tell you if your friendship is more important than free lodgings for random co-workers.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Call her back and rescind permission.  You are going to be rightfully resentful and possibly robbed.  I wouldn\u2019t trust strangers in my home.\n\nHey, I\u2019ve been thinking about this, and I am really uncomfortable with your coworkers staying in my home.  It\u2019s just not going to work for me.  You need to find somewhere else for them to go.  You shouldn\u2019t have invited them to my place without permission.  I am not a hotel and I fell really disrespected.", ">I just feel like she should\u2019ve asked me first before promising anything to anyone.\n\nAnd you're absolutely right, she should have. If this was a one-off, I'd let it slide & try to enjoy myself. I would make it clear that this absolutely cannot happen again, tho.\n\nEdit to add, it would still be NTA if you refused letting them stay. Totally your call.", "NTA - You can't invite people to somebody's else's house without asking, that's an obvious breach of social etiquette.", "NTA. But you need to make it clear that this will not happen again. You helped *her* save face this time, next time she'll have to explain that she invited people without permission and now *she* has nowhere to stay either.", "NTA you have every right to be upset. What your friend did is rude and shows her lack of respect for you and your space! I would let her know that she needs to ask you before agreeing to these things especially because you don't live alone.", "NTA. Your friend lacks basic respect for you, and is pulling manipulative bullshit with the after the fact \"I shouldn't have done that...\" \n\nYou've said fine this time, so I'd proceed, but I'd bow out of the trip citing energy, and after the visit, I'd be very specific about what's acceptable in the future.", "NTA. Who does this? I can't even imagine asking a friend if I could have other random people stay, let alone inviting them without even consulting my friend whose home it is. That's a wild lack of boundaries.", "NTA! She was way out of line here. No way in hell would I EVER promise people they could stay at someone's home without asking first, especially if they are strangers.", "NTA, you\u2019re friend needs to learn that your house is yours and not hers. Set your boundaries and make them very clear.", "NTA!  Its completely unreasonable for her to have invited and apparently assured HER coworkers who you have never met that they could stay at your residence, presumably for free, while traveling, before she even approached you about it.  \n\nIt would be ok if she asked you first before mentioning anything to her coworkers and then respected whatever your decision was, but she did it totally out of order.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It's a pretty crappy move to invite people to stay at someone else's home.", "NTA- if you don\u2019t want strangers in your home speak up", "NTA. She is inviting strangers to stay at someone else's home. That isn't okay. It really is okay to tell her no. It doesn't make you a bad friend. She doesn't get to promise your things or your home to other people.", "NTA. It's pretty nervy to invite someone to someone else's house before asking permission to do so...sounds like she saw that in the end though, which is a good sign.  Hopefully she won't do it again.", "NTA, it's rude as hell to invite someone to use SOMEONE ELSE'S place and stuff. Your friend is taking advantage of your hospitality and feels entitled to your stuff. You're not overreacting, more like under-reacting, and would've been completely in your right to tell them to go find lodging elsewhere when they showed up.", "NTA for being mad. You should actually tell her that you are upset, rather than hiding your feelings and growing resentful.", "NTA - That is SUPER rude and entitled. How in the world do you invite people to another persons home WITHOUT asking them first?!?!? I really hope you have a conversation with this \"bff\" about this so she knows you are not a doormat, or a free hotel for her friends.", "THis is easy: Just tell her it won't work out, and her coworkers can not stay at your place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. That\u2019s really unfair, to put you in the position of either having to accept random people in your home or be the bad guy and say they can\u2019t stay. Very poor behaviour on your friend\u2019s part and you are totally justified in being upset with her. She can\u2019t ask you if it\u2019s ok after she has already told them it is.", "NTA. that\u2019s some rude and entitled behavior from her. she mist\u2019ve forgotten that she don\u2019t live with you and thus does not have inviting random people privileges.", "NTa. I would have flat out said no. Nothing good will come of them staying with you.", "Be an adult. Say no. If she responds bad.. Cut her off. NTA.", "NTA. I think this is a good lesson in boundary setting. It would have been okay to tell your friend. \"I will host them this time since you already told them but please ask me next time before you offer my place up to others\". I think you will feel better about the situation once you discuss how you feel with your friend.", "YTA for not telling her no when she asked/told you about her co-workers staying with you too. \n>\nIt\u2019s very passive aggressive to not tell her no but then to give her attitude about her doing the very thing you did not tell her no about.", "ESH. She can\u2019t read your mind. Don\u2019t say \u201cyeah that\u2019s fine\u201d and expect her to know that means \u201cNo, and I\u2019m upset that you did that\u201d.\nPeople have different expectations and yours won\u2019t be acknowledged if you don\u2019t express them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are allowing her to make choices for you that she has no right to make. STAND UP FOR YOURSELF or I forsee this \"friend\" continuing to TAKE ADVANTAGE of you because you won't tell her \"NO\". You DESERVE RESPECT, so please don't be her doormat and continue to walk all over you. Saying NO doesn't mean you can't be friends, it just means you have HEALTHY boundaries and are willing to tell people what is and is not acceptable.", "Thank you.

Saying no takes some time. I know I\u2019m still learning \ud83d\ude05 but you got this! It\u2019s your home and you should feel comfortable in it and not feel obligated to have anyone you don\u2019t want there.", "I really think she should have known better then. Depending on your dynamic (and your personality, as said by a super non-confrontational person here!) it might be uncomfortable to call her out directly, but you'd be doing both yourself *and* her a favour by addressing the behaviour. She left you in a super uncomfortable position and effectively took your choice away. I doubt any friend actually wants to do that to the people they care about. :)", "Definitely. But if OP and her friend were like 16-17 I'd be willing to at least partially pass it off as \"she doesn't know better\". \ud83d\ude02 If they're adults ... Yeah, less possibility of an excuse.
