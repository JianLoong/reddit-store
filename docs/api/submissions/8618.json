I call bs on her being the favourite child though, simply because you said she rents there and doesn\u2019t live there, which implies that she pays him to live there.

Fair play to him.", "YTA", "Yta", "YTA.  If she's a tenant in residence there, and has made a bona-fide offer;  she could tie this up in court for years.", "YTA", "YTA.  The home is not on the market.  Don\u2019t limit your search to the Dad properties and specifically the one your sister is living in. You\u2019re very entitled, aren\u2019t you?  Either that, or you\u2019re just trying to stick it to your sister.", "YTA. 100% YTA. Buy a different property off of him, or buy a property that isn\u2019t owned by him.", "ESH - yeah your dad is showing favoritism, but just go bye a different house, it\u2019s that simple.", "I'm confused if your dad has 10 properties why are you trying to buy the one your sister already lives in and plans on buying? There are 9 more pick one of those.", "YTA. Your sister already lives there/is renting. She may be saving up to buy already and they may have worked out a long-term payment plan.\n\nIt sucks that you feel that your father favors her over you. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s true or not, but regardless, to feel like it is would be upsetting. I get it. But she already lives there and you\u2019re basically demanding he kick her out because you can afford to buy right now and she can\u2019t.\n\nEdit: Also, from a business perspective, it\u2019s his property. He gets to decide who to sell to or who to let rent.", "NAH. Remember, he is a dad and he will want what is best for all of his kids. If he knows you have the means to purchase a property, I know he will be so proud of you when you do wether it\u2019s his or another property. If your sister needs more hep than you, he is going to help her as a dad. \n\nI also understand your feelings because I have always been in the position feeling like my parents were picking favorites, and it wasn\u2019t until I was a parent myself I really understood.", "ESH but in the end, it's his property so he can do whatever he wants. Maybe look for houses that are not owned by your dad.", "ESH ..\n\ntalk to him and explain how you feel and go from that.\nTell him he puts her first.\nAren't there other properties you can buy?why do you need the one she lives in? \nI thin k you suck because of the one your sister is in\nYour dad sucks because of his comment\nAnd you both suck die to the lack of communication", "Tell him no thanks and get a realtor.", "YTA\n\nyou sound so entitled! it is his to sell to whoever he wants! it doesnt matter what is \"in your mind\" you dont get to decide what he does with his property.\n\nAlso you can't disrespect dibs.", "She lives there dude. She had \u201cdibs\u201d a long time ago.  Maybe buy your own house, or one of the other houses your father owns.", "ESH. Sound like your sister is the golden child, so that makes your father the asshole (although there is the possibility that he's not, im just taking you at your word). You're an asshole for wanting to become further entangled with your dad, either emotionally or financially. The only reason to buy from your father is hoping for the house to be \"cheaper\" or the process to be smoother. It won't be cheaper or smoother, and by observing the family dynamics you should know that. If it's cheaper in money, it'll be expensive in the emotional turmoil for years to come, when 15 years down the road, it comes up at the dinner table, again.", "NTA. OPs Dad said she'd have to pay more than double the worth of the house so he could buy sister a house.  That's some pretty blatant favoritism.  Also, OP, why would you even want something from him if this kind of thing happens often. He won't choose OP unless she pays him to, that's pretty sad.", "I\u2019m guessing the other investment properties are already rented/being bought/spoken for. OP feels like she can offer to buy despite her sister currently living there because she has the money to buy right now, while her sister doesn\u2019t. (Not saying I agree with this perspective at all.)", "Where do you see OP insisting on one property??\n\n>I called my dad to see if he would be willing to sell me ***any*** of his investment properties.\n\nOP asked for any of them. Not solely the house where Sister lives.", "If she\u2019s really that ready to buy a property, why is she insisting to buy his in particular? Sounds like she wants a discounted home AND be able to to kick out the sister.", "It's possible the other properties aren't suitable.  They might be business and not residential, far too small or too big, in bad neighborhoods, too expensive, etc.  He doesn't necessarily have 10 homes in decent neighborhoods that are all priced at $450k.", "he also won't sell her any of the 9 fyi", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing too. I can easily imagine it as (granted, maybe ill-advised considering OP\u2019s clear jealousies/resentment) joke too. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll kick out your sister who already lives in this house if you\u2019ll pay me a million dollars!\u201d", "Who wouldn\u2019t want a good deal in this housing market? Prices are out of touch with reality", "She wants a good deal? Is that such a bad thing? I have bunch of money and I want to spend it where I know I'm getting more for my penny. She asked her father if any of his properties were for sale. He could have just said no. But he made this a contest to show up for his  favorite child.", "I somehow missed that part.", "She\u2019s showing off that she\u2019s ready to buy while her sister isn\u2019t. She ready to buy *his* property if he gives her a discount in particular, not necessarily ready to buy in general.", "Op is the only one winning in this scenario. Dad has to kick out his other daughter (who already has dibs to the house she\u2019s currently living in) to sell OP a discounted home. Why would anyone agree to that?", "its a blip, but they ask dad for any of the 10 properties", "Yes, so why say it is for sale? I mean, she made it clear she wants to buy the house."]}
