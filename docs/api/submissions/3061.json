{"id": 3061, "submission_id": "z2xsu7", "title": "AITA For Telling Someone They Don\u2019t Have Autism Spectrum Disorder?", "selftext": "I (36F) was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at age seven. My parents noticed something wasn\u2019t right when I was four. At first I was diagnosed with ADD by a psychiatrist who barely spent 20 minutes with me.  My Mom pushed for more testing after realizing I didn\u2019t fit the profile. I was diagnosed with ASD after testing that lasted over 16 hours by a behavioralist, a speech pathologist, and a pediatric neuropsychologist. Needless to say, this was a very rigorous and thorough evaluation. After that I went through the wringer dealing with the public school system and the mental health care industry neither of which knows what to do with people like me.\n\nWhen I was 14 I met a girl at a summer camp who had ADD. She was very nice. We had a lot in common, we had similar interests and likes, and so we became good friends. We remained good friends until we went to college mainly for the fact that we were now 1000 miles apart.\n\nI kept in touch with her for the next six years.  I\u2019ve only gotten back in contact with her within the in the last two. I don\u2019t know what happened during the time I fell out of touch with her. I think she may have given into some bad influences, but I don\u2019t know for sure what went wrong. I also have a hard time verbalizing what I make of her life now. She\u2019s over 500 pounds, collects social security (I don\u2019t know what for,) no longer speaks to her parents, and doesn\u2019t seem to have a life outside of social media. One thing she does is she blogs endlessly about her life with autism spectrum disorder.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem; she doesn\u2019t have autism spectrum disorder. She\u2019s been subject to the same rigorous testing, and the same periodic reassessments as me. In her case ASD has been ruled out time and again. Bottom line, she DOESN\u2019T HAVE ASD. \n\nAs for her blog, her posts read more like unhinged harangues. She\u2019s clearly not well, but she doesn\u2019t have ASD. After reading one of her blog posts I pointed out she does not have ASD. Her counter argument was that she read and researched ASD and knows for sure she has it.\n\nSince then, a handful of her friends have unloaded on me, saying that I have no right to talk to her like that and who am I to say she doesn\u2019t have ASD? My response is I\u2019m a person who lives with ASD, which is a cradle to the grave thing. One girl argued that her blog is a show of solidarity with people like me. It\u2019s not solidarity, it\u2019s crowding autistics like me out of the conversation about autistics like me, which is a major ongoing problem for the ASD community.\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s probably more that I can do, but AITA for handling it the way I did?", "created_utc": 1669230947, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2xsu7/aita_for_telling_someone_they_dont_have_autism/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A lot of people are pointing out in the comments the changes in diagnosis since her testing, the failure to properly diagnose women in general, and you even went through your own personal misdiagnosis. \n\nBut, honestly, bigger TA for policing over what a former friend with clear mental health issues is doing online. You are really not being \"crowded out of the conversation\" regarding autism when it comes to a blog that has what? 10-15 readers max?

Keep your unqualified medical opinions to yourself.", "YTA. You looked at 16 year old records. My son was not diagnosed with ASD until 20. The doctors thought he had ADHD until then. They also tried diagnosing him with a mental disorder at 15. Treatments for this disorder always failed. ADHD meds always failed. His new psychiatrist looked over his records and recommended a new evaluation. He was diagnosed with ASD.\n\nEdit: I say NTA after getting some additional information from OP.", "YTA.\nWhat does her weight have to do with it?\nAre you her doctor? Were you in the room when she got tested? Do you know exactly what the doctors said about her results?", "TL;DR at end\n\nYou're not licensed to diagnose nor are you directly involved with her doctors.  While you may feel she does not have ASD, and even if you are correct, you are not her doctor.  She needs to figure out what is going on and how to best cope with what she is dealing with.  \n\nWith that being said, there are some people who milk the system and exclaim, 'woe is me!' to gain sympathy and help from people.  She very well could be making it all up to get sympathy and attention.  OR she really thinks she has ASD as there is something definitely going on with her mental health.  Also, I've seen people struggling with mental health issues, and with no doctor to diagnose and no clear direction, they pick a diagnosis that sounds like a buzz-word or something that is common and claim it, so they can fall under an umbrella even though the umbrella isn't correct.  A label is a powerful thing and she gave her struggles a label.  This allows others to have an instant idea of what she might struggle with and how she might fit into society.  For example, she is 500 lbs. collecting social security with a bad relationship with her parents and her only connections are coming through social media and the internet. Throwing out a label like ASD takes all responsibility away and replaces it with victim-hood.  So suddenly not working, being obese, and struggling with interpersonal relationships isn't a problem, its a side-effect of something she just can't control.  See how it takes away responsibility and accountability?  You no longer are allowed to judge her on any of those fronts, as she has a disability that everyone knows of and you look like an asshole if you question it.  So there is potential for some shenanigans going on, but also, she could just be in a really bad place mentally and this is sort of the outcome. \n\nUltimately, what is the most important thing here?  You say you are getting crowded out of the conversation... what exactly does that mean? Are you more concerned with her well-being? More concerned with calling her out and being right? Or more concerned with feeling you have a voice in the ASD community?    \n\nPerhaps you could ignore the label she tries to give herself, and be by her side to help her with her struggles.  The flipside is that it can be super annoying to watch someone continue to lie over and over to gain something (attention, money, food, sympathy, a place to live, etc.) and you KNOW they are trying to manipulate everyone around them for their gain.  Once again, I don't know her motives but there are many things that could be going on. \n\nThis is such a sensitive topic that you just can't publicly call her out like that, as it will make you look like the asshole (even if you are right).  You could possibly have a private conversation (non-judgmental, non-aggressive) about how she didn't have ASD in the past and it's a lifelong thing, and it makes you confused.  You probably won't get anywhere and she will most likely continue to dig in her heels that she has ASD.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: YTA if you tell her she doesn't have ASD.  Socially, it is in poor taste (even if you're correct).  You can't go around telling people which diagnoses the do and don't have.  It looks really bad, and there really isn't a lot to gain.", "Here\u2019s my thing-you talk about her posts sounding unhinged and you recognize that things have clearly not gone well for this person so how is telling them that they don\u2019t have ASD helping? It sounds like you care for her and want to help her so I think it would make more sense for you to reach out and be a friend to her rather than correct her or un-diagnose her when you\u2019re not a professional. I\u2019m going with ESH because she shouldn\u2019t be faking any sort of condition but I think you should handle things better if you\u2019re really her friend.", "Soft YTA - the fact that she openly told you that she didn\u2019t get reassessed and just self-diagnosed is what makes her the AH. Autism and Tourettes are trendy and there is a ton of people on TT that fake having it for views. Where you\u2019re the soft AH comes in is from openly pointing it out. She\u2019s not going to admit it publicly and will get angry and defensive and it does no good to you. The only time to point it out is to warn others if she\u2019s putting up dangerous information for others to follow. Other than that, it\u2019ll get you nowhere but some extra stress.", "Wow. Who died and made you the spectrum gatekeeper? If you really are on the spectrum, you\u2019d know that there are MANY diagnoses under that umbrella. As the mother of a child with Aspergers I am so offended. I can\u2019t even see straight. YTA\nHow are you even privy to her confidential medical records? Are you a doctor? Are you a therapist? Just leave her alone. Get on with your own life. I believe that the way you\u2019re acting right now is one of your symptoms. MOVE ON", "Soft YTA. It's her blog and you said it wasn't really a blog, and she's obviously not well. As long as she's not hurting anyone then let her live in her fantasy. It's sucks she's representing herself as someone with ASD, but at the end of the day very few people will listen to her.", "NTA... so many peoppe \"diagnose\" themselves as being autistic because they're \"quirky\" and shit... pisses me off since I have a brother who is severely autistic and will never be independent, and I spent a lot of time helping out that community (I know there's varying degrees of autism and such)\n\nAutism isn't something you can just \"self diagnose\"... saw someone claim they were autistic because they rub their feet together while in bed... it's absurd", "I believe YTA. You don\u2019t have the right to point out or decide whether another person has a diagnose or not. It\u2019s none of your business at all. So what if she doesn\u2019t have ASD? That\u2019s nothing you should care about or comment. Why is this such a big issue for you?", "So a doctor never said she has ASD? Nta but you\u2019re never going to get through to her or convince her. Cut your losses now", "ASD is trendy, if you have it, it makes you cute. \nSeems that's the way society feels about it, it's an insult to anyone who does have it.", "NTA  - am I missing something here? You can't auto diagnosed yourself and claim you have an illness because you match the check list on the internet, or because you \"want\". Unfortunately, I have seen a lot more cases than I should, just because \"how I feel is more important than the facts\". Until she is diagnosed, she doesn't have ASD. She can run a blog about it, but not being honest about her medical situation, is immoral (I think it would be better if she would run a blog about the struggles of knowing something isn't right, but not matching any criteria).\n\nNow, OP that the kind of people you want in your life? Do think her friendship is worth the fight?", "NTA if she is not diagnosed to have it several times now she can't just self diagnose herself. Lying about having a certain disorder is wrong and it is not wrong to call people out on that.", "I understand your frustration... self diagnosing isn't a diagnosis... especially if doctors have ruled it out... if I claimed to have an issue that I was told by a doctor I didn't have I'd be an AH... so nta... but sorta... you could have handled privately and then if she didn't drop it or get a diagnosis then I would have cut communication", "This may be controversial, but NTA. You have the right to say what you believe, as long as you weren't mean about it. \n\nI do want to note that ADHD and ASD have a LOT of symptoms and behaviors in common, and they often overlap. So, it is possible that she does have ASD, even if doctors didn't initially think so. \n\nHowever, overdiagnosis is becoming a major problem, and can be invalidating for those who do suffer with certain illnesses/disorders. A big contributor to this is self-diagnosis. My first thought is that, if you have the resources to be diagnosed by a professional, you should not self-diagnose. The reason for this is that, if a non-trained person were to look at the lists of symptoms for various mental disorders in the DSM-V, they would likely resonate with many of them. ADHD, ASD, even anxiety are very relatable disorders to most people, and social media has made many people believe that they have a disorder. \n\nYour friend should see a professional before posting about a serious, lifelong diagnosis online. Aside from the crowding you mentioned, this can spread misinformation and create misconceptions.", "Edit: NTA after getting more info.", "NTA. People nowadays try to compete in the Victim Olympics so they can seem special. All they do is crowd the space so people like you do not get heard. People need to be called out on this BS.", "NTA if they haven't got this diagnosis despite regular check ups by her doctors, you are right to be concerned. The blogs she is doing may give others the wrong details and advice. My son has been diagnosed as on ASD when he was 8 years old. We were asked whether we wanted to go through the formal diagnosis protocol as he was getting full support from his school. But we insisted so we had the full information regarding his personal issues. This didn't cost us anything as we live in UK. But I am aware that other countries there may be a cost which will prevent the formal diagnosis being done.", "Since I wasn\u2019t clear the first time I\u2019ll have to fill things in.\n\nHer and I were treated at the SAME pediatric psych facility and tested by the SAME team. I turned out to have the markers of ASD, she did not. No, I\u2019m not a doctor. But the people who ruled out Autism in her care ARE DOCTORS.\n\nMaybe she could have been diagnosed by a doctor, but she hasn\u2019t been assessed by a doctor since the age of 18.
