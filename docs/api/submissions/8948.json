I'm sorry for the dynamic in your household and I hope it will be a wake up call for them. You deserve to have people show up for you, and sadly they don't. I'm sure that was hard for them to hear / face but I hope they take it in a positive direction. As much as you can, hold firm but be gentle and kind as you can. Say repeatedly if needed, that you love them, and you would have loved for them to come, but that you've learned from prior experience they most likely would not.

I'm so sorry youre not being given the attention and love you deserve. Thank you to your godfather and his girlfriend for being there for you. It sorta sucks for your parents, but that's the consequence of not being around for you. Why give tickets to people who are most probably gonna be there? What about the years of wasted tickets? I dont think your mum is being fair wanting to get the ticket when she herself said that Ellie needs extra help. If you give that to them and made them promise to go, and they did, youre the one who would end up with a broken heart and still have to suck it up because Ellie can't help needing the attention she needs. \n\nI know they probably also wanna go see you perform. Go out, have fun, take a rest and for one second not worry about Ellie but this is your family's situation. Mum needs to acknowledge that what theyre doing isnt enough for the both of you and if inviting your godfather and his girlfriend instead of them means youre going to get the support, attention and love you deserve then she needs to accept that and thank them, and thank you as well for being understanding.\n\nI hope you have fun with your godfather and his girlfriend. Good luck on your show!", "NTA - you have every right to be upset and to give your tickets to people that will actually show up.

You are almost all grown up and your parents are being faced with their consequences for not attending more of your programs.  \n\nYou aren't taking your frustration out on Ellie.

But your choice of words, while true to how you feel, wasn't very diplomatic (not that I expect it from a 16 year old). Basically, you told them they don't care much about you.\n\nWell, they prioritize the younger kid with higher needs, which isn't necessarily wrong (though it's questionable if it's happening again and again, leads to broken promises and hurts you in the process). They may have neglected you over it more than they'd like to admit and maybe not even noticed it as much they should have.\n\nBut the issue at hand is that they never came when they got free tickets, and you gave them to someone who actually came. Your discussion should've been about the tickets. However, you took the opportunity to address your entire situation and frustration. It's understandable on your part, it requires serious self-control not to do it after years of getting disappointed. But it's not like your parents did it out of malice. I think they try their best, and suddenly find themselves 'replaced' by your godfather and his girlfriend. They took your love and affection for granted and all of a sudden there's a distance and an accusation. So I kind of understand why they suddenly felt attacked and started to bite back. Personally, I think it was more out of helplessness in that situation. Adults aren't always right, all-knowing and wise.\n\nBut it's an AH move of them to attack you for it. As adults they ought to have a bit more self-control and the ability to reflect upon the situation, how they treat you and why, after getting free tickets and not showing up repeatedly, you decided to invite someone else.\n\nTheir lack of self-awareness is certainly a problem, and I hope you get the opportunity to talk about your problems and find a solution. But coming to the realization that they weren't right to attack you, that's something they have to work out on their own. I hope they do.\n\nAnyway, NTA", "NTA, but if they knew that they weren't going to go, why did they want the tickets this time around?", "NTA - Your tickets to do with as you please.

Your parents aren't handling this well, I suspect that you're seeing the pent-up frustration of realizing that their boy is almost grown up and they've missed a lot of your life. Seeing the tickets go to someone else just highlighted how bad the situation is for you and them.\n\nThe fact that your parents won't spring for their own tickets really makes it clear that you made the right decision; even if you'd offered the tickets to your parents, they probably wouldn't come. \n\nTo your credit, you're handling this in a very mature way, and I think in time you'll come to see your parents as rather desperately trying to hold things together through a very difficult time, and perhaps forgiveness will come with that. That doesn't mitigate the neglect you're feeling right now, of course. \n\nBut, this is what severe medical problems and disabilities due to families, unfortunately.", "They created a precedent that you've gotten use to.

Maybe step up as parents to BOTH OF YOUR children.\u201d\n\nYou are not selfish. Don\u2019t let someone tell you otherwise. You are a child who also has needs. Not wants, needs. Your needs are not being fulfilled by your parents and hence why you extended it to people who will fulfill those needs and there is nothing wrong with that. \n\nNTA", "My point is that the parents likely didn't notice that they neglected their older child, as he was more or less independent compared to Ellie and her needs.\n\nWhen OP pointed out their past behaviour and said his parent didn't care about him, they got defensive. To me this is often a sign that someone didn't expect to get attacked, and the normal reaction to a sudden attack is either to retreat or to attack. His parents chose the latter, because they very likely believed they were morally in the right (which isn't too far off from the truth, considering that Ellie *does* need more care and attention).\n\nWhere his parents are wrong is when it comes to attacking OP over it, that much is obvious. They didn't see how much OP slipped through their fingers, they didn't notice the growing distance and the disappointment in OP.\n\nAgain, they're wrong here, but nothing indicates that they were acting out of malice towards OP. They do what they can, they thought everything was alright, OP would understand if they couldn't make it due to Ellie needing sudden care, and before they knew what hit them, OP invites someone else, tells them to buy their own tickets and they didn't care about him anyway, so what's the point.\n\nWhat would you expect to happen in that situation? They're just human, with feelings and all, they probably don't feel great about that, too. They reacted poorly, because the issue of the tickets unexpectedly put their entire family model of 12 years into question.\n\nWhat's done is done, and OP has every right to feel hurt here. But it's not fair to accuse the parents of willful neglect towards OP. Caring for a child that needs special care is hard. They did what they thought was best, which clearly wasn't. I just hope they take the time to sit down, think about their own wrongs, admit that they messed up and try to do better from now on.", "I can tell you the result right now \"Our child is broken, please fix him.

It doesn\u2019t have to be intentionally malicious to be neglect. Ellie may need more support but that doesn\u2019t mean that OP doesn\u2019t need any. OP and Ellie are both autistic and has said that his parents are dismissive of his meltdowns but care for Ellie\u2019s, and even if he wasn\u2019t autistic he\u2019s still a child and all children need care. \n\nThere is also only a 4yr age difference, OP may be 16 now (which arguably is still a child) but this has been going on since he was maybe in kindergarten/1st grade. That is a lifetime of neglect, regardless of the parents intentions.\n\nI get where you are coming from, and it\u2019s not wrong to have empathy for the parents, but I do think it\u2019s wrong to ask that of OP because intentions don\u2019t matter when the consequence is child neglect.

But what will he gain if we condemn the parents? He is still a minor and has to live with them.\n\nThere's not enough info on Ellie, maybe it was really poor luck and her condition really got worse whenever the parents wanted to use the tickets. Or she has a psychological trauma/irrational fear of sharing her parent's love whenever they try to be with OP and her illness \"suddenly\" acts up? Who knows, both is possible.\n\nIt's always easy to put the entire blame on someone (the parents in our case), but winning the argument about who's in the right and wrong here isn't going to help OP in the slightest. If he wants to get anywhere and make a substantial change in how his parents behave, he has to understand where his parent's behaviour comes from, because he thinks they don't care about him. Which isn't true, as the parents do seem to care. Just that they give more attention to the child that seems to need it more (which OP admits is the case), and sadly they overdo it without much thought.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that they don't care. I completely understand why OP said that, but as a parent, if my own child hurled such an accusation at me, I'd be immensely hurt and probably also get defensive.\n\nA bit of empathy goes a long way, and if it helps defusing the situation, its the right thing to do.

Right now they are giving her laser-focused attention, which even if meant well can be overwhelming and disempowering (I should know, I was the Ellie of your family). \n\nAlthough Ellie has more support needs, if your parents treat her less like a child and more age-appropriately, she will gain skills such as emotion regulation and problem solving that will help her as she enters young adulthood  and increasingly needs that space and independence. \n\nFurthermore, your parents' overfocus on Ellie and under focus on you creates an unhealthy family dynamic. Although it is the job of parents to treat children as individuals and attend to each child's specific needs, it is also important for parents to attend to the family as a team. You all need to have a healthy group dynamic, as (especially in the \"west\") our immediate family serves as a support system and community.\n\nAttending to your needs, as well as Ellie's, only strengthens your family dynamic, which gives Ellie a community she can receive love and support from and to which she can give back.
