I play sports and do musical theatre but neither of them come to my matches or shows bc Ellie doesn't like crowds, I've had my birthday parties/plans changed/cancelled to better suit what Ellie likes to do, stuff like that. Also, while my support needs are low, it doesn't mean they're non-existent and I don't always feel like they get met at home.

I'm sorry for the dynamic in your household and I hope it will be a wake up call for them. You deserve to have people show up for you, and sadly they don't. I'm sure that was hard for them to hear / face but I hope they take it in a positive direction. As much as you can, hold firm but be gentle and kind as you can. Say repeatedly if needed, that you love them, and you would have loved for them to come, but that you've learned from prior experience they most likely would not. If they really care so strongly to be in attendance - and not just be given free stuff - they will buy themselves  tickets and show up. I greatly hope for all your sakes that they'll do that.", "NTA. I'm so sorry youre not being given the attention and love you deserve. Thank you to your godfather and his girlfriend for being there for you. It sorta sucks for your parents, but that's the consequence of not being around for you. Why give tickets to people who are most probably gonna be there? What about the years of wasted tickets? I dont think your mum is being fair wanting to get the ticket when she herself said that Ellie needs extra help. If you give that to them and made them promise to go, and they did, youre the one who would end up with a broken heart and still have to suck it up because Ellie can't help needing the attention she needs. \n\nI know they probably also wanna go see you perform. Go out, have fun, take a rest and for one second not worry about Ellie but this is your family's situation. Mum needs to acknowledge that what theyre doing isnt enough for the both of you and if inviting your godfather and his girlfriend instead of them means youre going to get the support, attention and love you deserve then she needs to accept that and thank them, and thank you as well for being understanding.\n\nI hope you have fun with your godfather and his girlfriend. Good luck on your show!", "NTA - you have every right to be upset and to give your tickets to people that will actually show up. Just because your sister needs extra attention doesn't mean you deserve to be ignored and shoved aside and blamed for wanting what seems to be the minimum attention someone that says they love you should be providing.", "NTA They have done nothing to deserve the free tickets and as you said, they probably wouldn't come even if they got them.   \nHave you tried talking with your parents about your feelings?", "NTA - Your parents are crying because they are facing the consequences of their own actions.  Please be aware that they are under an extraordinary amount of stress raising two children.  I feel like they told themselves every performance and award they missed that \"We will go to the next one.  There will always be another performance or award for us to attend.\"  \n\nWell, now there isn't.  You are almost all grown up and your parents are being faced with their consequences for not attending more of your programs.  \n\nYou aren't taking your frustration out on Ellie.  You shared your free tickets with someone dear to you.  IF your parents make the effort to attend, as you said, tickets are available to buy.  You can give your tickets to whomever you want.  \n\nYour parents are just hurt and you should be sensitive of their feelings but they are hurt because of their failing.  Not yours.", "NTA. Unfortunately, this is the inevitable consequence of your parents blowing off the significant events of yours for your whole life. They may have had a reason, but that doesn\u2019t make the hurt it causes you any less. Your feeling are genuine and legitimate. \n\nYour parents are reacting badly because they have been forced to face the results of a lifetime of decisions, and they don\u2019t like the results. It\u2019s a shame, they had tough decisions to make, and they dropped the ball concerning you.", "NTA.\n\nJust because your sister has extra needs, it doesn't give them an excuse to ignore yours.

ONE of them should always be at your events if BOTH can\u2019t make it.\n\nThey are so incredibly selfish for the way they have treated you AND THEY KNOW THIS!!!!!\n\nInstead of apologizing to you and making more of an effort- they gaslight you into believing that YOU are the problem! \n\nYou are NOT the problem!!!\n\nEnjoy your Day with Mike & Julie supporting you!\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\n\nMake it the best Day ever!!!!\n\nAnd ignore your parents meltdowns and tantrums!\n\nIf they really wanted to support you & your School they would BUY the tickets!\n\nDon\u2019t waste ANY MORE FREE TICKETS on them.\n\nThey\u2019ve already proven they NEVER use them anyway!\n\nAlso:\n\nYou are very kind to acknowledge that you recognize your sisters needs \ud83d\udc9c\n\nBut you also have needs that your parents are neglecting.

But your choice of words, while true to how you feel, wasn't very diplomatic (not that I expect it from a 16 year old). Basically, you told them they don't care much about you.\n\nWell, they prioritize the younger kid with higher needs, which isn't necessarily wrong (though it's questionable if it's happening again and again, leads to broken promises and hurts you in the process). They may have neglected you over it more than they'd like to admit and maybe not even noticed it as much they should have.\n\nBut the issue at hand is that they never came when they got free tickets, and you gave them to someone who actually came. Your discussion should've been about the tickets. However, you took the opportunity to address your entire situation and frustration. It's understandable on your part, it requires serious self-control not to do it after years of getting disappointed. But it's not like your parents did it out of malice. I think they try their best, and suddenly find themselves 'replaced' by your godfather and his girlfriend. They took your love and affection for granted and all of a sudden there's a distance and an accusation. So I kind of understand why they suddenly felt attacked and started to bite back. Personally, I think it was more out of helplessness in that situation. Adults aren't always right, all-knowing and wise.\n\nBut it's an AH move of them to attack you for it. As adults they ought to have a bit more self-control and the ability to reflect upon the situation, how they treat you and why, after getting free tickets and not showing up repeatedly, you decided to invite someone else.\n\nTheir lack of self-awareness is certainly a problem, and I hope you get the opportunity to talk about your problems and find a solution. But coming to the realization that they weren't right to attack you, that's something they have to work out on their own. I hope they do.\n\nAnyway, NTA", "NTA, but if they knew that they weren't going to go, why did they want the tickets this time around?", "NTA - Your tickets to do with as you please.

You could have been polite and asked them first, but ultimatly NTA.", "NTA, you just have bad parents", "**NTA**   And TBH, your comment should serve as a wakeup call to them about how often they blow you off to take care of Ellie.   The next time they call you \"selfish\", point out that *everyone* needs to feel that cared for and that they have prioritized Ellie to the extent that they never consider even trying to meet any of your normal needs.   \n\n>They said they shouldn't have to and I should be prioritising them coming\n\nAsk them when they have ever chosen to prioritize you.  Do not back down.   If they continue to berate you, tell them they need some counseling about how to achieve some balance in their family.", "NTA\n\nThey feel guilty for how they're treating you and they are lashing out at the perceived source of their guilt. Mike (edit: and Julie) sounds like he's been more of a parent to you than your real parents. Sorry you're dealing with this.\n\nYou certainly didn't take your frustrations out on your sister by telling your parents that you feel abandoned.", "NTA. They don't like to be confronted over the fact they don't care for you. Tell them if they show up and buy the tickets, you may give them the tickets next year.", "NTA\n\nSuggest family counseling, or one day your parents are gonna wonder why you never call and never visit.", "NTA - it was your choice who to give the tickets to, and you wanted to give them to someone who would actually show up and be supportive. \n\nAs someone who grew up with a sibling whose needs always came before mine, I really sympathize and I\u2019m glad you have your godfather in your life to fill that role for you. It\u2019s possible to love your parents, understand that they\u2019re just doing their best to handle a challenging situation with your sister\u2026but still feel hurt at the way your needs are ignored. Making a choice like this, to invite people who will be supportive of you, is a big step toward learning to prioritize your own needs, and I think it was a really positive thing to do. \n\nI would maybe just let your parents know that you would love for them to come if they\u2019re able to and buy their own tickets, and it would mean a lot to you to have them there, but this is an important event for you and, since you understand sometimes they\u2019re not able to show up for things like this, you used your free tickets to make sure you would have someone there with you for sure.", "NTA. You're exactly right about this:\n\n>They said I shouldn't have given the tickets to Mike and Julie because they aren't my parents, but I pointed out that if they want to come to the event they could buy their tickets instead.

Actually, it doesn't seem you're really \"taking out\" anything on anyone. You gave your free tickets to a close relative/friend who will actually come to the show, and if your parents decide they actually can and want to come this year, they can buy their own tickets as you said.", "NTA. They have already blown this important event off a few times in the past, you need someone to show up for you and I\u2019m proud of you for asking your godfather and Julie. I have friends and family in similar situations and the parents take turns attending events separately if care is also needed at home- is that not something they could also be done?\n\nRaising a family \u201ctakes a village\u201d, and I\u2019m happy you have a strong and supportive godfather that will show up for you. I know your parents are likely overwhelmed and exhausted, but it sounds like you request about one night a year for them to focus just on you- that\u2019s not asking for much at all.", "NTA. Your parents aren't handling this well, I suspect that you're seeing the pent-up frustration of realizing that their boy is almost grown up and they've missed a lot of your life. Seeing the tickets go to someone else just highlighted how bad the situation is for you and them.\n\nThe fact that your parents won't spring for their own tickets really makes it clear that you made the right decision; even if you'd offered the tickets to your parents, they probably wouldn't come. \n\nTo your credit, you're handling this in a very mature way, and I think in time you'll come to see your parents as rather desperately trying to hold things together through a very difficult time, and perhaps forgiveness will come with that. That doesn't mitigate the neglect you're feeling right now, of course. \n\nBut, this is what severe medical problems and disabilities due to families, unfortunately.", "They created a precedent that you've gotten use to. It really sounds like there's a good chance they would have canceled if you gave them the tickets. NTA.", "NTA. Your parents have noped out of supporting you in your extracurricular activities, and that hurts.\n\nThey are probably overwhelmed with caring for your sister, but you are equally part of the family. \n\nIt could be that they need a carer for your sister. They should be there for you as well.", "NTA- Expressing your feelings doesn't make you selfish. It also makes sense that you'd invite your godfather because he always shows up to your events. You didn't do anything wrong, you went with your heart.", "I've tried a bit but it never really goes anywhere. It usually just boils down to them accusing me of being resentful of Ellie because of her needs and saying that I'm being unfair and blaming her for things that she can't help. I don't really know how else to articulate to them that the problem isn't with her having her needs met but with me being ignored so much without it turning into that though.", "> suddenly felt attacked and started to bite back.\n\nThere was nothing \"sudden\" about it.   The OP says that Mike has always been the one to show up for him, even paying for tickets.   His parents have *chosen* to not give him more minimal attention.   Now he has verbalized what everyone knew, they want to get upset...too bad.", "They always say they want to come and promise they're going to but then usually something happens day of, like Ellie will have a bad meltdown or be having a really bad chronic pain day or be feeling really depressed so they have to stay home with her instead.", "I am guessing their displeasure is more at being confronted with the idea or judgment that they don't show up, and being 'replaced' by people who will. It's terribly sad that they'd want tickets to go to waste - and their son to be unsupported at this event yet again - than recognize that in themselves.", "I get where you're coming from but OP is 16. The parents are the ones who gotta step up and do what's best for the family. If they can't even do that OP could be wasting his time pleading his case but at least his parents can't say that \"you never said anything\".", "You're not blaming Ellie, you're trying to hold your parents accountable for their actions and rightfully so. you can tell them that you're blaming them for pushing you aside instead of working together to make sure you and ellie are taken care of. \n\nI'm afraid that if this keeps up, ellie will come to learn that she can get anything she wants. they'll do anything to keep her happy even if that hurts her in the long run by making her entitled, and though i empathize with both of you, they need to show her things will be okay if she has coping mechanisms, and you need to be supported by them being there for you", "> I don't really know how else to articulate to them that the problem isn't with her having her needs met but with me being ignored so much without it turning into that though.\n\nTell them that their inability to actually listen and understand what you are saying is an indication of the very problem and that maybe your family needs a counselor to help you all find a better outcome.", "Do both of them need to stay every single time? Can't they take turns?", "I see. Your parents should be more self-aware that this wasn't just a one-off thing. This happens consistently, yet they still make it sound like they don't have a history of not being there for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefinitely family counseling would be the next step.", "I don't know why it has to be both of them every time, but whenever I've suggested just one of them do it they act like I'm being unreasonable and don't understand what goes into looking after Ellie, even though I've babysat for her by myself loads of times and think I get it. Granted I've never had to watch her on my own when she's having a bad day, though."]}
