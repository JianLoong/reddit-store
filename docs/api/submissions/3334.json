On day 4 of the trip, I got a text message from our neighbor Cindy saying \"Phran, I don't know want to alarm you, but I think you were robbed.\" I was absolutely terrified but Cindy said she notified the police and said she'd get everything settled so that I and my family could enjoy the rest of our stay. When we got home, we talked with the police and determined nothing valuable had been stolen... except our flat screen TV and a laptop and that our apartment was kind of trashed. The police also said it was a very bad idea for me to put a note on the door and I soon realized it was. But we lived in a closed-doors apartment where the only people inside would be our neighbors who for sure wouldn't have stolen from us.
