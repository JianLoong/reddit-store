Linda is a long-term friend of my niece Jess (F24), and Jess essentially begged me to hire her as Linda was struggling to find work in her field of study and wanted to live in the city I work in. I\u2019ve taken on a sort of mentorship role for Linda, teaching her the ins and outs of our field. Linda is a quick learner and has been able to largely succeed in her role.\n\nGiven how closely we work, we\u2019ve gotten to know each other quite well, and as such, Linda does regularly open up to me about her own personal life. That being said, for the past month or so, I\u2019ve been getting the feeling that Linda seems to want something more than employment. It was subtle at first, but I\u2019ve noticed she has started acting more informally around me. It started with many compliments and bizarre questions; then, her mannerisms started to change. She has also begun texting me outside of work hours (which is pretty normal) but about things that are more casual and non-work related. At our relatively recent holiday gathering for work, she kept coming into my personal space, and her behaviour and comments were a little suggestive, to say the least.\n\nThis past Friday evening, I and a few of the younger workers (including Linda) needed to work late to finish off a project. When it got late, I decided to order us some pizza. I said something along the lines of \u201cWhat do you kids want on your pizzas?\u201d Linda seemed taken aback by this comment and asked me if I thought she was immature or something. This caught me by surprise, so I told her that while I didn\u2019t think she or the other interns were immature, I mentioned how since they were all young and new in the field, they lacked experience and were therefore like kids from my perspective.\n\nShe seemed very disappointed by this and didn\u2019t speak with me unless work-related for the rest of the evening. She was also absent yesterday from work \"due to illness.\" I told one of my non-work friends about this last night, and he suspects it's probably because of what I said.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704302714, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xojyx/aita_for_comparing_my_intern_to_a_child/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Something is wrong with Linda. \"Kids\" was intended as a lighthearted and affectionate endearment for your younger colleagues, and it wasn't meant to imply immaturity. But she still shows how immature she is so she prob deserve being called a kid.", "NTA\n\nIt was a nice way to shut her down and keep it professional, in front of witnesses.", "NTA. When I saw this title I figured it was going to be about hazing or workplace bullying, but it is not. It\u2019s just said in jest, and lighthearted and a ridiculous overreaction by Linda.\n\nI\u2019d put a quick stop to the casual texts with a 19 year younger subordinate of the opposite sex though. That can\u2019t lead anywhere good.", "NTA\u2014I\u2019m 26 and address my 25 and 24 year old coworkers as \u2018kids\u2019 when I speak to them collectively (it\u2019s a joke because I\u2019m really short compared to them, but besides the point) \n\nIf she was offended it probably was because she had feelings, it\u2019s not a bad thing to say.", "Nta, you said nothing wrong and was just being friendly. Her problem is she obviously wants something romantic with you, and by calling her kid and her mind you're giving her too young for a relationship. You did nothing wrong. Wrong. This is just her and the fact that you can't tell business mentorship from looking for relationship proves that she is young and kid is appropriate", "NTA. She's outing herself as hot for the boss by throwing a (rather ironic) tantrum about how mature she is.\n\nA man in his 40s calling the interns \"kids\" isn't weird or offensive, and it was probably the cleanest way for her to get the message.\n\nLet her have a sulk and if she's absent for more than a reasonable amount of time for an illness, or if her performance suffers, have a professional discussion about it.", "NTA\n\nYou just made a friendly comment about a group of people.\n\nI'd be really careful around Linda if she pushes boundaries again & let HR know if need be to protect yourself.", "NTA she\u2019s young, probably started crushing on you and your comment hurt her feelings. She will be fine.", "Such nonsense. Of course you can. People get so serious about rubbish!!", "NTA - She got upset because she realized that you see her as too young for a romantic or sexual relationship, which it seems like she was interested in. Honestly, even if it was unintentional, I think what you said was the quickest and easiest way to \u201clet her down gently\u201d before she actually made a move and jeopardized her position.\n\n\u201cKids\u201d was a lighthearted form of endearment, and it seems like no one else was bothered. I think she was because of her feelings for you, and it shouldn\u2019t be a problem in the future.", "NTA Honestly, probably best you made your perspective clear to her this way, all of this could have gone so much worse.", "Maybe she was cranky cause she missed nap time?", "ESH. Calling them \"kids\" was patronising and inappropriate for the workplace. Separately, Linda's earlier behaviour towards you was also an inappropriate way to interact with a colleague.", "NTA. Please be very careful with this stuff. It wouldn't be the first time that a resentful woman will spin this story into you sexually harassing her. Please please please just keep everything work related. Linda is angry and now actually behaving professionally, just keep it this way. Its the best outcome.", "info:  \n\n\nis this an unpayed internship or is she actually employed?", "Calling an adult in their mid-20s a \u201ckid\u201d in a workplace environment is pretty condescending and inappropriate. I get that you meant it initially as a joke, but when confronted you doubled-down on it and actually stated that you thought they were kids. YTA for that.\n\nBut she has, more importantly, been acting somewhat inappropriately towards you so I feel you need to set boundaries here.", "NAH. She was interested. You found a very good way to let her know that you are at different points in life. Maybe in 10 years you might see her differently. but a 25 year old just starting out is very young compared to a 43 year old established in a career (an usually married 1 or more times).", "Sorry, I don\u2019t agree with calling colleagues kids.  Yes they are your juniors but they have a job now.  Kids is a dismissive term and really shouldn\u2019t be used.  Using it once to set a boundary with her is ok, but using it again or often is disrespectful.  I put it in the category of using the term girls at work.", "NAH don't call her kid and she shouldn't bet all butt hurt either.", "This is an example of a micro-aggression.  Some people don't like to be called things.  You are ignorant to that trigger for them.  It doesn't matter why it's a trigger for Linda; maybe she's been harassed for her age.\n\nThe proper response is to apologize for not knowing it was a problem for her and then don't call her that.\n\nBut you are NTA for doing it once... or even twice.", "YTA\n\nLinda's behavior is immaterial here (it's a problem, but not related to the issue at hand). You called a group of adult colleagues \"kids.\" Don't do that.", "YTA\n\nDon't call adults kids, even in jest.  Do they ask you if a storm is coming when your knees are bothering you, old timer?", "I was going to say NAH until you explained that calling them \u201ckids\u201d is a reflection on their age and lack of experience. Calling adults in their mid-20s \u201ckids\u201d isn\u2019t terribly respectful, especially in a work environment, but if it were lighthearted it\u2019s probably not a huge deal. \n\nThat explanation, on the other hand, was actively condescending. What does their level of experience in that field have to do with their level of maturity? Basically you told them that because they\u2019re not as experienced, you don\u2019t see them as full adults. Any adult in their mid-20s would feel insulted by that, and even if it\u2019s okay from an HR standpoint (questionable) it\u2019s not a good way to foster effective working relationships with your subordinates. People work harder for supervisors who treat them with respect, so you should probably apologize. \n\nAs for Linda\u2019s behavior, if she continues to push personal boundaries, you might have a chat with her about what is and is not professional behavior. If you\u2019re in a mentor type position, you have an opportunity to guide her and it sounds like she could use it.", "Very light YTA. It sounds like Linda has been unprofessional and if you were a good mentor you\u2019d call that out, but interns are your colleagues even if they\u2019re young enough to be your kids. Consistently treating them like colleagues will help reinforce those professional boundaries.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
