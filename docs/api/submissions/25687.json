If women can say other women are beautiful and gorgeous, then why can't a man say that about another man without there being something sinister about it?\n\nInteresting that your wife's friends don't want their sons around you now...but I wonder how they'd feel if your wife had made comment about another woman being gorgeous.  Would they have not wanted their daughters around her?", "NTA that's hilarious and your friends are either homophobic or mad stuck up.", "Going with NTA. Weird comment for sure, in front of others who may not share your sense of humor, in your spouse\u2019s office. But was it deliberately or inadvertently an AH move? No. \n\nNow if you had made some disturbing comments about his body, or implied what you\u2019d do to him in front of your spouse\u2019s coworkers, then I think that\u2019s closer to being a distasteful AH. Or just gross and creepy.\n\nI think your spouse\u2019s coworkers maybe have a problem with you complimenting and feeling (some level of) attraction towards another man. Maybe they\u2019re quietly homophobic? Because your wife obviously understood the joke and is not offended you have eyes and can observe others\u2019 appearances. She seems very comfortable with your sense of humor and confident in your relationship- if your wife is unconcerned I would follow her lead.", "NTA, they\u2019re definitely homophobic \n\nBut my brother, you\u2019re not on the gay spectrum, you *are* the spectrum \n\nIs your wife a cover? You can tell us, we won\u2019t judge", "NTA. It was an off the cuff comment, you didn't even say it to him. And seriously, they're that worked up trying to defend some man? I guarantee you that guy would have just laughed it off. I suspect this is really underlying homophobia from her friends.", "NTA.

No big deal. NTA", "NTA And her coworkers are absolutely ridiculous! There's nothing wrong with complimenting someone like that!", "NTA it was a slip up that didn\u2019t actually hurt anyone. Was it the best place/time for it? No, but that doesn\u2019t make you an AH. It wasn\u2019t a degrading comment. Your wife\u2019s friends sound homophobic.\n\nWhat is a concern is how their kids may be affected by this and then in return your kids. Homophobia is real and I hope they don\u2019t get shit from school and friends about you being gay/bi. That would be a terrible outcome to this.", "NTA. Giving another person a compliment is not a bad thing, unless the other person has explicitly said they are not comfortable with that.

I am completely ignoring the question of whether you find him sexually attractive.  That\u2019s not the point of whether you are an AH or not.  Your comment was best made _in private_ to whomever you wish\u2026not at work on front of that persons subordinates.  You put them, and your wife, in a very uncomfortable position.", "Slight YTA.

I DEFINITELY want to see a picture of the boss!", "Those aren't friends, no loss", "You're saying I would be the AH if her boss was a woman. I agree, but to truly flip the whole situation based off just the boss alone, we would need to swap more. I, a female, would visit my husband, and would call his female boss beautiful.

I'm saying he might not be straight because of the way he talks about her boss. It sounds like he's sexually attacted to him, not just physically attracted, and there's nothing wrong with that.", "You\u2019re reasoning is convoluted. You clearly felt a sexual attraction and made a sexual comment. The people around you felt the difference, you admit it was a sexual reaction.

How is that a difficult concept?", "\u201cGorgeous\u201d is not a sexual comment lmao", "The point of my comment was to clarify his comment since you had trouble understanding what he was saying. How is that a difficult concept?", "Again, he clearly states that he felt a sexual attraction. The other people in the room were made uncomfortable by the comment and or tone. It was an inappropriate time and place. Not difficult.", "Nope. It\u2019s inappropriate to make a sexual or physical comment at work. The sex/gender doesn\u2019t matter. He clearly states he felt a sexual desire and the reaction of the people around him indicate that the comment was seen as inappropriate. None of this is difficult."]}
