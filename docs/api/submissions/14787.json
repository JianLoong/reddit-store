I have thyroid disease and due to this, I'm roasting hot to a point of having difficulty breathing damn near constantly. The only comfort I have is my fan (we have two garage fans- one for my husband and one for me- that are small but throw off really cool air and work exceptionally well). We aren't allowed to stick an AC in the window OR have our windows open at all until June, per our lease agreement ($50 fee for every time they see a window open before June, as well as different fees for putting an AC in prior to June) because heat is included in rent.\n\nWhen I go to sleep at night my fan is pointed directly at me. My husband goes to bed much later than me and lately I've been working up at 2am-3am drenched in sweat and BOTH fans pointed towards my husband, who is cocooned in 2 blankets (he gets cold easily). So basically he has both fans on him for no reason. I'm quite admittedly becoming infuriated with waking up this drenched in sweat, to a point of feeling like I have pissed the entire bed. It's disgusting, I feel filthy and I'm uncomfortable and it's for no reason, as I said, because he's wrapped up in two blankets with both fans while I have no blanket on me, no fan and I'm drenched. I asked him to stop and originally he tried blaming the cats for knocking it to the fan and making it move, which IS possible. They are your typical cats who love being dinks and knocking things over. But this wasn't it and I found that out quickly, as I wasn't fully asleep one night and felt the fan off of me randomly and watched him put the fan to his side of the bed. I told him, sleepily, he had better put my fan back and he did immediately, no question. That was the only night I woke up with the fan still on me.\n\nSo I moved the fan. The way our room is set up is our dresser is off on my side of the bed and our office set up (computers) is at the end of the bed. Our rooms large. I moved my fan to the dresser and pointed directly on me. I woke up at 3am this morning and found my fan halfway moved down the dressed and kitty cornered to hit my husband and not me. I was fucking livid. I absolutely lost it. I told him to get out of the bedroom and go sleep on the couch in pure rage because he's being selfish and making me uncomfortable by putting both fans on him while he's wrapped in two blankets and making me sweat my ass off. He keeps trying to say I'm an AH and it's not him, \"it's the cats, I swear\" but I truly don't buy this excuse because I physically caught him once already moving my fan off me.
