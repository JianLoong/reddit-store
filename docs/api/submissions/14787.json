I have thyroid disease and due to this, I'm roasting hot to a point of having difficulty breathing damn near constantly. The only comfort I have is my fan (we have two garage fans- one for my husband and one for me- that are small but throw off really cool air and work exceptionally well). We aren't allowed to stick an AC in the window OR have our windows open at all until June, per our lease agreement ($50 fee for every time they see a window open before June, as well as different fees for putting an AC in prior to June) because heat is included in rent.\n\nWhen I go to sleep at night my fan is pointed directly at me. My husband goes to bed much later than me and lately I've been working up at 2am-3am drenched in sweat and BOTH fans pointed towards my husband, who is cocooned in 2 blankets (he gets cold easily). So basically he has both fans on him for no reason. I'm quite admittedly becoming infuriated with waking up this drenched in sweat, to a point of feeling like I have pissed the entire bed. It's disgusting, I feel filthy and I'm uncomfortable and it's for no reason, as I said, because he's wrapped up in two blankets with both fans while I have no blanket on me, no fan and I'm drenched. I asked him to stop and originally he tried blaming the cats for knocking it to the fan and making it move, which IS possible. They are your typical cats who love being dinks and knocking things over. But this wasn't it and I found that out quickly, as I wasn't fully asleep one night and felt the fan off of me randomly and watched him put the fan to his side of the bed. I told him, sleepily, he had better put my fan back and he did immediately, no question. That was the only night I woke up with the fan still on me.\n\nSo I moved the fan. The way our room is set up is our dresser is off on my side of the bed and our office set up (computers) is at the end of the bed. Our rooms large. I moved my fan to the dresser and pointed directly on me. I woke up at 3am this morning and found my fan halfway moved down the dressed and kitty cornered to hit my husband and not me. I was fucking livid. I absolutely lost it. I told him to get out of the bedroom and go sleep on the couch in pure rage because he's being selfish and making me uncomfortable by putting both fans on him while he's wrapped in two blankets and making me sweat my ass off. He keeps trying to say I'm an AH and it's not him, \"it's the cats, I swear\" but I truly don't buy this excuse because I physically caught him once already moving my fan off me.

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,until they act like a selfish jerk, then do unto them as they have done unto you and see if they learn anything when the tables are turned. Sorry you have to teach your husband such a simple lesson in fairness, but it is one he needs to understand.", "I'd put one of those doorknob alarms (less than $20 on amazon) on the fan so it goes off when he moves it.

This is selfish beyond reason", "NTA. I have hypothyroidism and if my partner constantly, needlessly, subjected me to those horrendous night sweats I would seriously reconsider the marriage. \n\nHe's being a selfish AH and purposely subjecting you to MISERABLE conditions because he wants to play cozy little baby. \n\nHonestly, at this point I'd chain the fan the fucking wall next to my bed or get a divorce", "NTA the landlords and the husband are both TAs here. No open windows? That\u2019s insane. Our weather is so good that windows should be open as much as possible.

The cats do this EVERY SINGLE NIGHT?", "oooh i\u2019m a fan of the superglue idea", "My husband likes to use velcro for everything. She should get some and use it to attach the fan to her dresser without telling him (it will ruin some of the dresser probably, but fuck it). No way he can deny he's been the one moving the fan when she hears that velcro at like 2am.", "My one thought was....what if he has a sleep walking issue? I know the chances are slim, but what if he legitimately has no recollection of whats happening? OP should have him consult a Dr. About it.", "100%. I'm not usually one to say break up, but this shit is personal.\n\nI live in Jamaica, the nights can be hot AF.

He is repeatedly increasing her discomfort and denying responsibility. He needs to go before he causes her real harm.\n\nNTA, OP", "> I\u2019d suggest having a serious conversation with him\n\nWhy bother?  He lies to her face, even when he knows she's aware he's lying.  There's no point in trying to have a seriousl conversation with someone who isn't honest.", "I'd wake him up by pulling his blankets off and then draping my sweaty hot self allllll over him and rubbing it in and then saying \"If I gotta feel gross, then so do you, buddy!\"", "I have night sweats too. What helped me was cooling sheets and Gabapentin.", "This was my first thought. I would comically drill the fan to my dresser, tape it, everything. NTA.

The landlord owned the house and lived in the lower floors. He had spent a lot of time and money restoring the house, and didn\u2019t want window A/C units because they would spoil the look of the house.\n\nIt was a cute little apartment and she used tons of dans everywhere, but it got way too hot in the summer.\n\nAnd the landlord wondered why he never had tenants stay more than a year. Because even in New England, summer temps can get above 90 F, 32 C, and attics get even hotter because hot air rises and also the sun beating down on the roof.", "\"Master of the house, doling out the charm...\"", " It's abusive. He could just get his own fan at this point, but he takes yours and lies about it. I would die on this hill.", "I totally agree with you.", "I'd fucking leave him. So infuriating.", "This is one of the few examples of actual gaslighting I have seen on Reddit.", "Especially because he physically moved the fan the laat time. Cats don't do that, their cute little paws no work that way.\n\nHe is being incredibly selfish, especially with OP having a medical condition. I wonder if this is the only way he is selfish in their relationship.", "I DID have a cat that turned on my touch lamp every night at 3:30am.

The fact that you think it is speaks volumes.", "It's not the fans.  It's the lying directly to her face, even when he knows she's fully aware that he's lying.  I have to wonder what else he's lying to her about.", "It's not \"over fans\". It's about repeated, unapologetic, sadistic treatment of his wife. He *knows* what he's doing.

Sure it takes up floor space, but it's more effective than a fan at cooling one room.", "I'm sure she says later \"until june\" as the heat is included in rent!  Not sure where they live to need the heat on till June, but if they are allowed at any point in the year, then it doesn't sound legal.

He takes both after she falls asleep.", "If he had another fan, she would wake up with him under three blankets with all three fans pointed at him and none at her.", "I would die on this hill.

It get's to be 105-110F in the summer there. One day he brought in one of those huge industrial fans. Set it in the entry hallway pointed towards the kitchen where we normally hang out. Plugged it in and turned it on, and it literally blew all the decorations off the walls lol My MIL and I laughed so hard! I think it took us a good 10 minutes before we stopped giggling.", "I actually have one of those on top of a shelf and pointed directly at me every night. It's amazing. The lowest setting is the highest on a regular fan.", "You could say that at the moment OP's is perspirational.", "This is why I love the dual temp layer my DH got me for my side of the bed about 2 years ago.  I can adjust it to be warmer or colder without it disturbing how he's sleeping.  It's expensive, but worth it to me.", "Nooooooooo that is upsetting. Sorry to crush everyone's dreams. Maybe there's a civilian version out there somewhere?", "I think people agree that the term gaslighting is overused, which is why a comment celebrating that it was finally used correctly got so many up votes.\n\nRemember the original gas light has the husband secretly adjusting the settings on the lights and then making her doubt her own perception that they've changed.\n\nShe SAW him move the fans once and he's pulling some bullshit about the cats to make her not trust her own eyes and conclusions. Instilling doubt and complete refusal to admit the situation is being actively manipulated by the perp is spot on for gaslighting.\n\nIt doesn't require him to convince her that she is doing it.", "I google it and gaslighting is defined as: a manipulative tactic in which a person, to gain power and control of another individual, plants seeds of uncertainty in another person's mind. The self-doubt and constant questioning slowly cause the individual to question their reality\n\nSo I would believe that intentionally moving the fans and trying to convince her she's being unreasonable and crazy by accusing him whilst blaming the cats. Even to the point where he flat out says it's not him when she sees him do it counts as gaslighting.", "Lying and saying the cat did something she saw him do is an attempt to make her doubt her perception of reality especially over time like this. It's a textbook example of gaslighting", "Just because he's not saying she did it doesn't mean this isn't gaslighting. This is one instance where the term is correct.  \n\nHer: Hey, I see you moving the fan. Put it back.  \nHim: Okay.  \n\nHer again on another night: I know you're the one moving the fans, I saw you doing it.  \nHim: No, it's not me, it's the cats.  \n\nHe's telling her what she saw with her own eyes/ remembers is wrong. This is textbook gaslighting.", "No, this is gaslighting. He's deliberately lying in a way designed to make her question her own perception. She saw him do it, she called him out, and he's still doubling down on the \"it's the cats\" lie to try to get her to not trust her own memory.\n\nI experienced gaslighting and I get frustrated when people use it to describe other things because it's a specific experience that can turn your whole sense of perception upside down if you don't get out. Garden variety lies or manipulation aren't the same thing. But this is exactly an example of what it is.", "The term might be overused but was used correctly here. He does not need to try to convince her that she committed the act for it to be gaslighting, it\u2019s enough that it\u2019s happening, he\u2019s clearly doing it and trying to convince her that he didn\u2019t and make her doubt her perception of what is happening and feel irrational for reacting to what he is doing.", "She *saw* him do it, and he told her it was the cats.  How is that not gaslighting?", "Yep. I think he\u2019s amusing himself with her discomfort and tells himself he\u2019s playing around or being funny and this little back and forth is just some banter they do. He\u2019s not hearing her or understanding how this is affecting her. I wonder if he is dismissive of her medical condition.", "Sleeping in a cold room with a breeze and lots of blankets is the best so I do understand that part. But I would never do this to my partner because I'm not a complete monster. I would honestly never be able to look at someone the same way if they knowingly and purposely caused me to suffer like OP's boyfriend is doing. This is a bizarre and cruel level of selfishness.", "I keep my room as cold as possible just so I can wrap myself in more blankets because I enjoy the weight of them.  Which might be what husband is doing, but he's being an absolute dink about it.  He clearly only cares about himself and is only thinking about his needs and not what's best for both of them.", "> Taking both and wrapping himself up in blankets like??? What's the damn point.\n\nI get what you're saying. But also, I've known people who turn the temp up and leave the window open in winter because they want to feel warm, but also want to feel a cold breeze.\n\nIt's infuriating living with someone like that.", "I had a friend who got one of those and would pull a blanket around himself like a poncho, with the cool-blowing end of the machine underneath it, put the machine on a long extension cord and drag it around him like he was some kinda Star Wars character. His own cool tent.", " I live in Jamaica, the nights can be hot AF.

Used it every night!", "Solving this issue should be a breeze", "Perspiration is the mother of aspiration!", "Actually, that's not what happened. In Gaslight, the husband is searching for treasure in the attic at night. Because he's using lights in the attic, the lights in the whole house would dim (that's how gaslights work). He's not purposely adjusting the lights to make his wife question her sanity or perception. It's just a byproduct of his treasure hunt. It's not targeted towards her.\n\nWhat he *does* do is secretly move a piece of jewelry and, when his wife can't find it, he tells her that she must have moved it and forgotten about it. He does stuff like that through the play/movie, and insists that she's misremembering things and/or crazy. It's those tactics that the community studying domestic abuse was referring to when they popularized the term \"gaslight.\"", "IMO in that scenario he needs to purchase himself a second fan on his own, otherwise he needs to use less blankets. Like deliberately making someone else uncomfortable so you can use more blankets is just horrible.", "I mean, I like colder air and my weighted blanket as well but I'd never turn BOTH fans in a room to me if we had two fans and two people, you know?

Don't force the other person to do that.", "Not before June though, as per the lease agreement.", "This is a FANtastic opportunity for some problem solving!", "TIL.
