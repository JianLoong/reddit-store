It might relieve stress on both of you (Sis was out of line, though. It would have been like telling someone who's pretty to make themselves ugly).", "So NTA. I hate bridezillas. Why should you have to make a long term change to your appearance for somebody's wedding? \n\n\nWhen I was in my early teens, I was due to be a bridesmaid at my uncle's (dad's brother) wedding. I had long blonde hair down to my waist. One of the older bridesmaids got her hair cut into a chin-length bob. The bride liked it and decided all the bridesmaids should match, so demanded we all had our hair cut into bobs. I was a self-conscious kid and there wasn't a lot I liked about my appearance but I loved my thick long blonde hair. I didn't want it cut and told the bride as much. She responded \"have it cut or don't be a bridesmaid. End of.\" \n\nI responded \"fine, I won't be a bridesmaid then\". This interaction got relayed to my uncle, who complained to my grandmother, who complained to my parents. I was told I was disrespectful and ungrateful. I was grounded and forced into having my haircut. At the wedding reception, the bride came to me later with a smirk and said \"there, it wasn't such a big deal was it and you still got to be a bridesmaid\".  She was expected agreement and even gratitude, and instead I just glared at her until she got uncomfortable and walked away. Not adding to my mood was the family member that remarked how much chubbier I looked with short hair. \n\nIncidentally, it took me longer to grow the hair back than the marriage actually lasted. Something to bear in mind!", "People will talk about it for ages: \"Remember that day we saw that woman with a very red hair? Did you know her sister married that same day?\"\n\nNTA. This is ridiculous. Does the bride has no shine at all that some hair will rob all the attention off her? And why does she wants to hog ALL the attention anyway?", "If she wont budge with her wanting to dye your hair you can either not go with is fine or you can just attend as a guest you dont need to change yourself for someone elses wedding its one thing if you dyed it and thats why it was so vibrant but that\u2019s just how your hair naturally is you shouldnr have to hide it your hair sounds beautiful! NTA", "NTA.  Generally speaking, you don\u2019t ask people to change their appearance significantly for your wedding.  You can ask the wedding party to style their hair a certain way (as long as it can be done without altering the length/cut of their hair).  You can have hair decorations for them to wear, like pearl headed pins or headbands.\n\nAt the very most, you could ask someone to delay a major change (eg, someone planning to dye their hair a radically different color, or make a big change to the cut).  But it has to be actually asking, which means you have to be willing to accept a no.\n\nMy mom and my sister are fiery bright redheads, and my MIL has slightly less bright red hair.  I\u2019ve got more common dark brown hair with just a hint of red to it.

As a culture, we seem to have agreed that you can ask a bridesmaid to humiliate themself by wearing an ugly dress, but asking them to change their hair color or otherwise disguise a natural or permanent part of their body is a step too far.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t threaten to not come to the wedding (although I\u2019d be tempted).

Of course, this could have a big impact on your future relationship with your sister. \n\nNTA. Your hair is a part of you, and you shouldn't have to change that, ever, if you don't want to. Ask her if she really doesn't want you there. Because chaging your hair isn't accepting you as you are.", "NTA. Sommmeeeoonnnneeeeeeee is jealous that she didn't inherit red hair. Does she know she can dye hers to get (or get close to) your color? Then you'd be matching sisters. But, no really, this is a ridiculously childish demand. Get a hot pink or rainbow or glitter wig -- poof you did what she asked.\n\n(Also, does she think you showing up to her wedding with a radically different hair color -- especially if it's a more subdued \"natural\" color -- wouldn't cause any reactions?

I\u2019m a hairstylist, and it\u2019s not as easy as using a \u201ctemporary\u201d color and expecting it to wash out back to your natural, that does not exist. You would have to go pretty dark to fully neutralize your bright red color, and it would not fade completely out. It would be a huge, potentially damaging, project to get it back to your natural, and even then it\u2019s impossible for hair dye to exactly match a natural hair color. \n\nWho the hell asks someone to alter their body features just for their wedding?! That\u2019s her own insecurity speaking. \n\nListen to your gut on this. Don\u2019t change your hair. Set a boundary with your sister! If she can\u2019t see why this is INSANE, then don\u2019t go.

Offer to pass on important information to the new maid of honor.\n\n2) Tell her you'll be happy to be a guest and enjoy her happy day.\n\n3) If she tells you you're not welcome, sadly but politely accept it and say that you hope she has a lovely wedding.

When my sister got married, it was going to be in a pretty conservative church.

Second, this wedding is going to by full of people who actually know you, right? So, you dying your hair would mean all their attention would be on you, wondering why you'd do that out of the blue. Kind of counterproductive, if the aim is to *stop* you taking focus from the bride. And, importantly, third, the bride can dictate a lot about her wedding, the dress, what part you play, that sort of thing, but she has zero right to dictate that you make changes to your body, especially when you've expressed you're against the idea and why. \n\nKeep your natural hair colour. Only go to the wedding if she drops the dye demand and apologises to you. Otherwise stay home.

At the very least, she should have told you about her hair color demands when she first asked you to be in the bridal party.\n\nIt's ridiculous how so many brides think it's OK to demand that their bridesmaids change their appearance for the wedding.

I have the photo album from my first wedding, and the number of times I looked t those pictures when I was married to my ex was pretty low after our second anniversary.  We did have a few framed pictures in our home, but that was about it.  What really mattered to me was that the people we loved were there to celebrate with us, and we had a great time.\n\nOn a side note - I think I have a business idea: a service that will find bridesmaids who will match a bride's vision for her wedding day so her friends and family don't have to put up with all the nonsense.
