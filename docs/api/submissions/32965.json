The 8 people included: the justice of the peace, the photographer, the couple, the bride's parents, and the groom's parents. She also mentioned her grandfather might be going, which I brushed off at the time, thinking \"Well, she's close with him so that makes sense\" even though he would've brought the \"strict\" limit up to 9 people. She reminded me that we would be included in photos and dinner afterwards, but neither my husband or I could be at the ceremony. As someone who also had a small wedding a year ago and had to make some hard calls, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. This was her day and these are the kinds of calls you have to make during a small wedding. My husband - the groom's only sibling - was understandably upset. I understood why and listened to his thoughts and was also not happy that he wasn't being included, but was trying to treat it like I hoped other people would feel about our day. I also figured that in the hierarchy of the family, if we have to make some hard cuts, then it makes sense that my BIL's parents are there, especially since he's close with them.\r  \n\r  \nA side note - my husband and his brother are not particularly close. There's no bad blood, and they do care about each other - they're just two very different people.\r  \n\r  \nThe wedding day comes and we arrive right on time to see the bride and groom exiting the courthouse...with the bride's grandfather AND grandmother. As we were walking to the spot for photos, the bride's mother told me that the courthouse had set up a room for 30 people and were confused that the couple didn't have more people attending. She also said that she didn't understand why her daughter didn't call and ask if they could include two more people so that my husband at the very least could be there.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, once they are back from their honeymoon and there's an appropriate time to talk to her (or both of them), I want to hear her side of what happened. But tell me...AITA for not addressing this sooner and bringing it up after the fact?

So, YWBTA if you do this without his consent.\n\nUltimately, though, this was their wedding.  They made a choice to only include parents and grandparents at the actual ceremony.  There could be a number of personal reasons for this that had nothing to do with space that, quite frankly, are none of your business.  A confrontation will either force them to discuss stuff they didn\u2019t want to discuss (hence the implication that it was a space issue\u2026implied but never actually stated) or create drama when they tell you it\u2019s none of your concern.  \n\nJust as an invitation is not a command, it\u2019s also not a right.  Couples are entitled to decide how big or small they want their ceremony to be.  Our desire to be present in the moment does not entitle us to being present in someone else\u2019s moment.  Can that hurt?  Yes, it can.  But their wedding isn\u2019t about you or your husband\u2019s hurt feelings.\n\nSo, I ask again\u2026what\u2019s the endgame?  What, exactly, are you looking for?  What are you hoping to accomplish?  Are you wanting them to admit they\u2019re wrong?  And if they don\u2019t believe they did anything wrong (likely scenario)?

Just because the courthouse had a larger room, doesn\u2019t mean they wanted a larger wedding. The \u201cstrict limit\u201d may have been their own calculations rather than a facility restriction, and they also may have wanted to have more space.\n\nOne thing we all have to adjust to, after Covid rules have waned, is that just because the official rules let people be more crowded doesn\u2019t mean everyone is comfortable being more crowded.

Why be petty? \n\nThey did things the way they wanted to, they wanted to keep it small. It\u2019s not like other friends or siblings were invited.\n\nThey\u2019re your family, it cost nothing to give them the benefit of the doubt and be kind in the situation.\n\nWhat exactly is the endgame of a confrontation? An interrogation does generally not bring people closer together. Do you want to be closer? Or not? If you don\u2019t, then why bother with a confrontation or even a question?\n\nAll this stupidness over not scoring an invite to a wedding. I can\u2019t believe believe anyone would make a big deal about this. And you were invited to the celebration after the ceremony. Petty.", "It's bad etiquette to expect any presents at all when you get married. Should guests give a gift? Yes. Is it a requirement to attend? No.     \n\nBut hosting a dinner after a ceremony definitely counts as a reception, and nothing in the OP says there wasn't any dessert after the meal. Cake and punch receptions in the church hall after an afternoon wedding ceremony don't include a venue or music, but they're still receptions.", "Exactly! And who knows maybe the court house charges for 30 people . Sounds like BIL and SIL were trying to keep the wedding less costly .\n\nI really think it\u2019s a simple miscommunication .", "It really wasn't fine. If there was no bad blood between the brothers, it was pretty hurtful to exclude his only brother and his wife. Family get togethers are going to be very unpleasant in the future. What were they thinking?", "Or, the bride asked a couple of years ago when there where other guidelines and don't think/care to ask again.", "Which makes BIL and SIL the asshole as SIL implied the courthouse had the rule, and even the bride's mother thought that was odd.", "Yeah same , if my brother and SIL blamed everything on my partner they would totally not be at my wedding.", "Yeah I read the OP different . The wording is weird to me . I feel like BIL and SIL had a strict 8 person limit . Not the court house so that\u2019s where my confusion comes in .", "Maybe they were thinking that they only wanted people they were close to at their wedding.", "I also read it as BIL and SIL set the 8 person limit. It sounds like they wanted a very small ceremony. I think OP will be the asshole if they don\u2019t let it go.", "Yes. If it had been the venue, it would have been impossible to stretch it to 9. So it was the couple\u2019s limit, and it didn\u2019t go to 11."]}
