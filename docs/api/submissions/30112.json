I remember her but I don't really remember her as the mom who did stuff with me. She got sick when I was 4 so I remember her sick. I used to sit with her in the bed and she'd read to me and stuff, and she'd sing, and brush my hair (I have long hair for a guy and always had) and she'd listen to me talk and sometimes she'd tell me stuff she wanted for me. My mom had a lot of jewelry. Her engagement and wedding rings, a charm bracelet that she had since she was a kid, a locket, a heart necklace, a birthstone necklace and some other items. Mom wrote in her will that I was to get them all. I used to wear one of her necklaces and I'd hide it with my clothes. But then my dad remarried and stuff got really awful.\n\nThe jewelry had been in my room and suddenly it was stored in the attic. Then my dad had a daughter with his wife and suddenly there were whispers about the jewelry. She's 7 now and there has been more talk lately that she should get some of mom's jewelry and my dad has said he would like her to have a piece or two, that he wants to include her in his old life, and show he loves her just as much as he loves me. He often tells his daughter that my mom is sort of like her aunt and she would have loved her and she'd be so glad his little girl could wear her jewelry. I told my dad it would not happen and all of it was mine like mom wrote in her will. My dad was always like it doesn't have to be a fight, we can discuss it more over time, and maybe let his daughter see it so she could decide if she likes any piece in particular.\n\nMy dad's wife told me it would be a beautiful symbol of our family being truly united. She spun this idea that the story that I wanted my baby sister to have a piece of my mom and to share my mom with her and prove that I love her as a sister and not just a half sister or a daughter of my dad would be the most incredible story ever. She said it would make her daughter feel so special. \n\nI freaked out that they would give her something against my wishes and so I spoke to someone I trust and I got the jewelry out of the house and with said person... a person I trust. I won't say where just in case my dad or his wife reads this. But it is safe and that person will keep it safe for me. I trust them 10000000%. My dad didn't notice for a while but then when he was getting the Halloween decorations down he was like what the hell. He asked me where I put them and I said he would never know. His wife was pissed and she told me I destroyed what could have been a beautiful gesture and story.\n\nMy dad told me I was a selfish little brat and how disappointed he was in me. He said he wanted to share a piece of mom with his daughter and why couldn't I let him do that with one single piece. I told him because the jewelry was mine. Mom wanted that. He told me taking it out of the house behind his back was still wrong. He grounded me for a couple of weeks because of it. He's still mad at me too.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698856191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17lg1sg/aita_for_taking_my_moms_jewelry_from_my_dads/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell him to open up his wallet and release the moths to buy something for her if he feels so compelled.\n\nThe fact that your Mom had to leave her jewelry to you in her will says she knew your Dad would pull this. My husband would give every bit of jewelry to our daughter if I was gone, no will needed.", "NTA. It is not a \"beautiful gesture\" for them to steal your belongings so they can show your stepsister that she deserves to be catered to at your expense. Ask them what beautiful sisterly gesture, in the form of expensive jewelry with sentimental meaning, she will be giving you in exchange? And how will your stepmother be making you feel like her Real True Son, in the form of expensive family heirlooms? When you marry, will Daddy be inclined to make beautiful gestures of family unification by giving your stepsister's things to your new siblings-in-law so that they can feel like your real siblings too? \n\n\"Daddy wants to cater to his new family by giving them his son's cherished heirlooms without his consent\" is not a \"beautiful gesture\", it is theft.

You did the right thing by your mom - and yourself.", "NTA, step-mom should give you her wedding ring as a symbol of her love to you. It would be a beautiful story to tell everyone how she wants to give up her jewelry as a gesture of how much you mean to her. She can brag to all in the land just how amazing and selfless she is as a step-mother.", "NTA. They want to create family memories? They can avoid stealing from you and completely disregarding YOUR MOTHERS last wishes. If they badmouth you to your sister when she is older explain that your mother left things to you as her child", "NTA. \nGood for you. \nRemember that your stepmother is an opportunist.", "NTA you did the smartest possible thing. It\u2019s hard to believe so many dads want to give their dead wives jewelry to their new kids because it\u2019s like a weekly post in here but no your dads new family does not get your family heirlooms he\u2019s insane", "NTA\n\nYour mom intended for you to have all her jewelry. End of story", "Nta. But you gave jewelry to a person you trust??? This is not safe at all.\n\nRegarding your father, if your mother left the jewelry to yourself only, it's yours. You're not in the wrong. He can't decide on his own to give a part of YOUR inheritance to a stranger (your half sister is a stranger to your mums family).", "Nope, you're not the asshole. If he really wanted to show her how much he loved her, he'd give her something that was valuable to HIM, not you. And given that he kept pursuing this despite you (his child) showing your discomfort to him over and over, you're not to blame for being more protective of that which you value. My mother is kind of the same, and when I wanted to play with her father's stuff and she said no because it was precious, I respected her wishes. Because I get that they were the last remnants of her father after his passing. Your father should have known better, if not his wife. Maybe try going to family therapy if you want to keep the family. But if you think it's not worth it... then it's totally okay to love someone and not want them in your life.\n\nOh, and it also seems like your father is fooling himself by including your late mother in the family he has with someone else. Complex families can be difficult, so protect what you can and give up what isn't worth it.", "NTA. If all of it was given to you in a will, your dad and stepmom can pound sand. Navigating the relationships is a whole other thing. It's nuts to even offer any of your mom's jewelry to a 7 yo that has no connection with her.", "NTA. If the jewelry was willed to you, it's your property not your Father's or Stepmom's so they don't get a say in what you do with it.\n\nTechnically, they don't have a leg to stand on, but as you're only 15, try to find a Family Member on your Mom's side who can advocate for you.", "Absolutely NTA - you took the steps you needed to protect YOUR belongings and inheritance from your mother. Your father and stepmother have no right to promise gifting items that do NOT belong to them in the first place. Good for you for standing up for yourself and not allowing them to steamroll over you (and your mom\u2019s) wishes", ">His wife was pissed and she told me I destroyed what could have been a beautiful gesture and story.\n\n>My dad told me I was a selfish little brat and how disappointed he was in me. He said he wanted to share a piece of mom with his daughter and why couldn't I let him do that with one single piece.\n\nHere's where it went off the rails for me. On the surface, it seems like what they want to do is wholesome and family uniting but their reaction to you hiding the jewelry.  Wow.\n\nNTA. I totally get that having hardly any time with your mother you don't want to share even a little piece of her. Perhaps you'll change your mind over time but for now, it's understandable.\n\nIf I could offer any advice, please remember your little sister is completely innocent in this. She will need you in her life. I hope you can build a wonderful relationship with her because I'm sure she's worth the effort...even when she's snotty to you. It's going to be a very valuable relationship so please, don't blame her for the ideas being put into her head.", "NTA. Normally I would say it was up to your dad, but if your mom specifically left these things to you, then they\u2019re yours. As soon as you\u2019re old enough to get  safe deposit box on your own, though, move the jewelry there.", "NTA- Your father is a thief and a liar.", "Lol NTA.. if it was some friendship bracelet or scarf collection, it wouldn't get the interest it does being items of monetairy Value", "NTA.  They're acting very suspect about this.  Why would they be upset about the box being somewhere secure.... if they really intended to \"talk\" about giving the sister a piece later?  I don't think they intended that at all. I think they intended to take something from the collection, and they're upset now because they can't.  \n\nIf they really wanted to do this right, they would also want the collection to be safe, and wouldn't mind they weren't the ones keeping it safe.", "NTA. You can either do this and save the jewelry or wait until you're an adult and sue him and your sister for replevin, earning the resentment of your sister when she's forced to give it back. This is cheaper and better for the whole family.\n\nI hate seeing posts like this with a dude disregarding his dead/ex-wife and prioritizing his new kids over the old ones. It's way too common. I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I hope you have a support system from your mother's side that will help keep her memory alive for you.", "What is beautiful about gifting someone else's possessions?\n\nThey should gift their own stuff.\n\nFor instance, your stepmother could gift you HER jewelry. \n\nThat would create the connection she apparently wants to create with someone else's stuff.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA \ud83d\udcaf. Your father is horrible. Im glad you got the jewellery out, keep it out and safe until you are 18.", "Stepmoms always making up some ritual everyone needs to do to show them how great they are", "NTA it\u2019s your property, your inheritance, you don\u2019t need to run it by him or anyone.", "NTA,  BUT what you can do, is get a necklace with your and your sister birthstone and give her that at Christmas and say it was part of  your mums jewellery .  She wont know and if you dad and stepmum  are wise, they will keep their mouth shut. It doesnt need to be expensive.\n\nIt isnt her fault  that she has two shitty parents, so she doesnt need to be punished.", "Nta and I'm glad you got the jewelry out of the house.", "YTA. If your dad was asking you to give him every single piece of jewelry or if he was trying to sell it and then keep the money, I'd be right there with you. But he wanted one piece of jewelry to help connect his old life with his new life in a meaningful and positive way. Yeah, you are being selfish, especially since that piece of jewelry would still be part of your life and it would be loved and enjoyed by your half-sister whom, hoepfully, you love and care for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
