I remember her but I don't really remember her as the mom who did stuff with me. She got sick when I was 4 so I remember her sick. I used to sit with her in the bed and she'd read to me and stuff, and she'd sing, and brush my hair (I have long hair for a guy and always had) and she'd listen to me talk and sometimes she'd tell me stuff she wanted for me. My mom had a lot of jewelry. Her engagement and wedding rings, a charm bracelet that she had since she was a kid, a locket, a heart necklace, a birthstone necklace and some other items. Mom wrote in her will that I was to get them all. I used to wear one of her necklaces and I'd hide it with my clothes. But then my dad remarried and stuff got really awful.\n\nThe jewelry had been in my room and suddenly it was stored in the attic. Then my dad had a daughter with his wife and suddenly there were whispers about the jewelry. She's 7 now and there has been more talk lately that she should get some of mom's jewelry and my dad has said he would like her to have a piece or two, that he wants to include her in his old life, and show he loves her just as much as he loves me. He often tells his daughter that my mom is sort of like her aunt and she would have loved her and she'd be so glad his little girl could wear her jewelry. I told my dad it would not happen and all of it was mine like mom wrote in her will. My dad was always like it doesn't have to be a fight, we can discuss it more over time, and maybe let his daughter see it so she could decide if she likes any piece in particular.\n\nMy dad's wife told me it would be a beautiful symbol of our family being truly united. She spun this idea that the story that I wanted my baby sister to have a piece of my mom and to share my mom with her and prove that I love her as a sister and not just a half sister or a daughter of my dad would be the most incredible story ever. She said it would make her daughter feel so special. \n\nI freaked out that they would give her something against my wishes and so I spoke to someone I trust and I got the jewelry out of the house and with said person... a person I trust. I won't say where just in case my dad or his wife reads this. But it is safe and that person will keep it safe for me. I trust them 10000000%. My dad didn't notice for a while but then when he was getting the Halloween decorations down he was like what the hell. He asked me where I put them and I said he would never know. His wife was pissed and she told me I destroyed what could have been a beautiful gesture and story.\n\nMy dad told me I was a selfish little brat and how disappointed he was in me. He said he wanted to share a piece of mom with his daughter and why couldn't I let him do that with one single piece. I told him because the jewelry was mine. Mom wanted that. He told me taking it out of the house behind his back was still wrong. He grounded me for a couple of weeks because of it.

Tell him to open up his wallet and release the moths to buy something for her if he feels so compelled.\n\nThe fact that your Mom had to leave her jewelry to you in her will says she knew your Dad would pull this.

It is not a \"beautiful gesture\" for them to steal your belongings so they can show your stepsister that she deserves to be catered to at your expense. Ask them what beautiful sisterly gesture, in the form of expensive jewelry with sentimental meaning, she will be giving you in exchange? And how will your stepmother be making you feel like her Real True Son, in the form of expensive family heirlooms? When you marry, will Daddy be inclined to make beautiful gestures of family unification by giving your stepsister's things to your new siblings-in-law so that they can feel like your real siblings too? \n\n\"Daddy wants to cater to his new family by giving them his son's cherished heirlooms without his consent\" is not a \"beautiful gesture\", it is theft.

You did the right thing by your mom - and yourself.", "NTA, step-mom should give you her wedding ring as a symbol of her love to you.

She can brag to all in the land just how amazing and selfless she is as a step-mother.", "NTA. They want to create family memories? They can avoid stealing from you and completely disregarding YOUR MOTHERS last wishes.

End of story", "Nta. But you gave jewelry to a person you trust??? This is not safe at all.\n\nRegarding your father, if your mother left the jewelry to yourself only, it's yours. You're not in the wrong. He can't decide on his own to give a part of YOUR inheritance to a stranger (your half sister is a stranger to your mums family).", "Nope, you're not the asshole. If he really wanted to show her how much he loved her, he'd give her something that was valuable to HIM, not you. And given that he kept pursuing this despite you (his child) showing your discomfort to him over and over, you're not to blame for being more protective of that which you value. My mother is kind of the same, and when I wanted to play with her father's stuff and she said no because it was precious, I respected her wishes. Because I get that they were the last remnants of her father after his passing. Your father should have known better, if not his wife. Maybe try going to family therapy if you want to keep the family. But if you think it's not worth it... then it's totally okay to love someone and not want them in your life.\n\nOh, and it also seems like your father is fooling himself by including your late mother in the family he has with someone else. Complex families can be difficult, so protect what you can and give up what isn't worth it.", "NTA. If all of it was given to you in a will, your dad and stepmom can pound sand.

On the surface, it seems like what they want to do is wholesome and family uniting but their reaction to you hiding the jewelry.  Wow.\n\nNTA. I totally get that having hardly any time with your mother you don't want to share even a little piece of her. Perhaps you'll change your mind over time but for now, it's understandable.\n\nIf I could offer any advice, please remember your little sister is completely innocent in this. She will need you in her life. I hope you can build a wonderful relationship with her because I'm sure she's worth the effort...even when she's snotty to you. It's going to be a very valuable relationship so please, don't blame her for the ideas being put into her head.", "NTA. Normally I would say it was up to your dad, but if your mom specifically left these things to you, then they\u2019re yours.

They're acting very suspect about this.  Why would they be upset about the box being somewhere secure.... if they really intended to \"talk\" about giving the sister a piece later?  I don't think they intended that at all. I think they intended to take something from the collection, and they're upset now because they can't.  \n\nIf they really wanted to do this right, they would also want the collection to be safe, and wouldn't mind they weren't the ones keeping it safe.", "NTA. You can either do this and save the jewelry or wait until you're an adult and sue him and your sister for replevin, earning the resentment of your sister when she's forced to give it back. This is cheaper and better for the whole family.\n\nI hate seeing posts like this with a dude disregarding his dead/ex-wife and prioritizing his new kids over the old ones. It's way too common. I'm sorry you have to deal with this.

She wont know and if you dad and stepmum  are wise, they will keep their mouth shut.

If your dad was asking you to give him every single piece of jewelry or if he was trying to sell it and then keep the money, I'd be right there with you. But he wanted one piece of jewelry to help connect his old life with his new life in a meaningful and positive way.

Look around your house and I bet you\u2019ll find that pictures and other items of your mom\u2019s have conveniently disappeared. As to the jewelry, you need to go and catalog every piece. Use a spreadsheet, or some other program, and list the individual pieces with a detailed description of the piece. Take pictures to attach to the document so there is a visual representation as well. Take the jewelry to a jeweler and get it appraised, even if it\u2019s clearly a $10 piece of costume jewelry and log those amounts in the document as well.

Even if you have an joint account with your dad, you may want to get a trusted relative from your mom\u2019s side to go help you open an account, again at a bank your dad doesn\u2019t use.

Keep in mind that your birth certificate is likely to be needed if you switch schools, or your passport if you travel out of the country.

He wouldn\u2019t have done that if he didn\u2019t care about it.", "How is a 15 year old expected to negotiate with two adults? By grounding him for a few weeks the dad is using his authority to bully his son!", "Bad idea, bet you my last dollar they\u2019d agree and just give him some random ass cheap thing from one of their grandma or great aunts houses that holds little to no sentimental or monetary meaning.", "NTA. This right here.  Tell stepmother you want some of her family's jewelry to bond you to her and make you feel connected to her.  I bet she treats you like you are nuts.  If your half sister comes to you to ask for your jewelry,  make sure she knows that you will be happy to share something of your mom's with her when her mom shares something of equal value both in price and sentiment with you.", "For real. They already decided they were just trying to convince you so they could avoid a conflict. Also your dad was trying to win brownie points with an old dime instead of spending a new dime to do so. \nThey\u2019re being selfish and inconsiderate of you. That is all that was left to you by your deceased mother for sakes. You\u2019d be justified in wanting to keep it forever but I don\u2019t suggest you point this out or die on that hill as you are 15 and like it or not your his son so you\u2019re in a tough spot.", "\"Is your step family willing to give up family heirlooms to you? I highly doubt it. Maybe tell them that if they give you some of their family jewelry and exchange you might think about it.\" \n\nThat was my first thought when I read this post! Somehow I think the giving and taking is only one sided.  Why would the step daughter be entitled to the jewelry of a woman she never knew and has absolutely NO relation to? Is there any monetary value in the jewelry besides the engagement and wedding rings?", "And stepmother is telling her daughter about this fantasy so then OP's half-sister will be upset when this fantasy doesn't happen. The half-sister would never give this another thought if her mom and dad weren't harping about it.\n\nAnd, seriously - what is with the stepsiblings/stepparents wanting property of a dead parent??? People they have absolutely NO relation to but somehow want things that belonged to them because \"it will create a bond\"... Crazy.", "Exactly.  Dad stole it once out of his room.  He put it in the attic as an excuse in case his son noticed, and he did.  Dad will steal it again if given the chance but the next time it will be hidden so OP could never recover it.  OP's dad is a huge asshole.", "I totally get where you're coming from, but it seems like the mom left all of the jewelry, including items that would be highly sentimental to the dad, to OP. I obviously don't know why this is the case, maybe it's a good reason, but it does seem strange to me. I've always felt that it does no good to assume the worst. If my wife passed and left all of her very sentimental jewelery to our son I'd honestly feel a bit bad about it. Like you said, maybe it was with the intent that it would be gifted to a future spouse, but there is more to the family now than the mom had foresight to know. A new wife, a new daughter from her husband, who is to say what she would have chosen knowing that. All I'm saying is that it not evil to seek sentimental belongings from a spouse who has passed.", "Is it so wrong to think of other people as humans with complicated lives?", "That's not entirely true, could have easily been done out of spite. Not saying that's true at all, I don't know OP, just attempting to include some kind of rationalization as this sub tends to always imply the worst in people they don't know.", "Exactly! And what is wrong with that stepmother? I'd never want a child to part with anything left by their mom. Never. I would protect their absolute right to keep those things as a tribute to mom.", "I agree except we need to leave the half-sister out of the fight. It\u2019s the grown-up\u2019s faults.", "Your suggestion is bad and you should feel bad. It isn\u2019t the daughter\u2019s fault that her mum and stepdad are thieving AHs and OP shouldn\u2019t involve them in the discussion.\n\nAdditionally, your idea is predicated on the idea that OP\u2019s dad and stepmother will behave honorably and not just pocket any jewelry OP brings into the house. Given that they were already planning to steal the jewelry, relying on their honor feels like a bad idea.", "Even better! Sweet! I hope OP\u2019s bank does!", "*HIS* inheritance, OP is a *male*.", "His inheritance.", "Please give us a 3 years later update of your escape", "It would only be fair, he wouldn't want a piece of junk in return, and that's what they would give him if they could, (and they would) ...", "OP is male, so his mom left to him.", "I did say he should only say something if his father and stepmother turn him into the bad guy....  \"Op is so selfish.   His mother meant for their little angel to have a special piece of jewelry.  Bad Op is keeping it all to himself. \"  My thinking is if and only if the parents use the daughter to attempt to manipulate him, he turns it back onto the parents and makes them the bad guys.  Hopefully, he will be able to have a good relationship with her when she is an adult, but I can see her parents turning her against him.", "Ahh, thank you.  Same point tho. I'd protect any childs right to their moms things."]}
