{"id": 3515, "submission_id": "z7shjh", "title": "AITA for asking my friend to return my hoodie?", "selftext": "I (21F) have this friend, Vera, that I no longer spend much time with, due to our differences. Our friendship is all but over, and I rarely ever talk to her, and that too when we are hanging out with mutual friends. Vera was much too toxic for me in a lot of ways. Hanging out with her became an exhausting task for me, because I'd end up going with a cheery mood and leaving with a sour sad one. She used to be a bully back in school, and hasn't grown much since then, which results in a LOT of comments about my body, dressing style, preferences, etc. She often makes me feel like I'm not feminine enough with her comments about my body, height and lifestyle. She has treated me like I'm her male friend for years, and I couldn't put up with it. \n\nSo here's the petty conflict. I have this black and red hoodie that's very meaningful to me. It was the hoodie I wore the day my boyfriend first told me he loved me. It is a silly reason to be fond of the hoodie, but it is what it is and it means something to me. A few months before Vera and I stopped conversing, she was going through a tough time emotionally and I was there for her through it. She was shivering and asked for my hoodie, so I gave it to her. I let her keep it for a few weeks and didn't ask for it back because I didn't want to bother her about something so petty when she was clearly upset. However, I started asking for it back after some amount of time, and she jokingly told me a lot of times that she's not going to give it back because it's hers now. Made a lot of comments about how it makes her feel safe because it feels like a guy's hoodie because it's \"huge\" (I'm not even overweight, but since she's very short, she's petite and thinks anyone who weighs more is \"fat\" even though the person in concern is much taller and cannot be the same weight as her). She also tried to make the whole thing cute as if this was  a playful argument between a couple. It pissed me off, but I let it go, thinking she'd give it back eventually. However, we had a blowout some time ago (unrelated reasons) and I stopped talking to her. \n\nA month has passed since the fight, and I haven't received my hoodie back. So, I contacted her to tell her to give it back. She started with the same bullshit again, and told me it was hers now. I pressed, and told her that it was important to me, but she said my reasoning was stupid and dumb and that she won't be returning it. We had a huge argument, and she accused me of being shallow and unreasonable, and that the hoodie was important to her because it comforted her when she was upset. And that by demanding it back, I'm taking that comfort away. I persisted still that I wanted it back. \n\nI know it's silly that we're fighting over a hoodie, but it's important to me... and after knowing it's important to her as well, I'm still not willing to let it go, and I don't know if that makes me an asshole. \n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1669724288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7shjh/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_return_my_hoodie/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's a huge AH and its a good thing u cut her off, her reasoning is probably fake since she has always done things to make other people feel bad.

She's toxic, as you've identified. You may not get it back, but you're well within your rights to demand it.", "NTA, the hoodie has sentimental value to you and its yours. Every normal person would return it. She is 100% an asshole.", "It's your property speak to the police", "NTA\nshe needs to give it back", "NTA but personally I'd sacrifice an item of clothing just to avoid that maniac. There must have been some other items that day that you were wearing that you can associate your memories with instead of the hoodie?", "NTA. If you're up to it do whatever you need to do for a little while to get back into her good graces, spend some time with her at her place, and find an excuse to leave the common areas, then find it/take it back. It's a bit unethical but needs must if you really want it back and she won't give it.", "NTA\n\nThe hoodie is your property. You loaned it to her because she was cold. You didn\u2019t gift it to her.

Since you don't like my body, height, weight or even the type/style of clothes I wear, you should return the hoodie before someone sees it in your home.\"\n\nMaybe that'll make her think about how she treated you. Maybe not. \n\nIf you have a mutual friend maybe ask the friend to get her to let the mutual friend \"borrow\" the hoodie so she can give it to you. I've actually done that before to someone who refused to give me back a beloved book.", "Nta", "NTA. Similar things have happened to me before and I suspect it\u2019s not about the hoodie itself for her. \n\nIt\u2019s about pretending she has a bf hoodie or a special hoodie. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s maliciously or consciously doing this. \n\nBut in my experience, when other girls (back in middle and high school) wanted things or kept things related to my boyfriends, there was that weird element to it \u2014 pretending they had a boyfriend who gave them the thing I was lending or asking them to keep for me. Eg. I asked one to hold onto a gift a guy gave me, full of love notes, and the girl pretended they were for her. \n\nI also don\u2019t think she necessarily is into you or your bf sexually or romantically. I think she\u2019s playing pretend in her mind about feeling loved. \n\nIf you want the hoodie back without fanfare, I would recommend getting a cheap big boyfriend hoodie at a thrift or something. Have a fun friend date with her and give her the hoodie as a reminder of the fun day you had. Then get your hoodie and ghost. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/3y_C03YkAjs the \u201cwomen\u2019s charity\u201d SNL skit is basically what you\u2019re describing. If you think it could be an icebreaker, maybe it\u2019s worth a share. \n\nOr alternatively, a mutual friend could just grab the hoodie for you. What\u2019s your ex friend going to say? That you stole something of yours? It sounds messy to involve others. It can be. I\u2019ve done this exact thing for friends, as the hoodie snatcher. \n\nI will also say this. \n\nYou\u2019re 21.

She may react unpredictably or get defensive and angry, and your friend group will probably get dragged into an exhausting amount of drama. It might be better to just bring one or two friends to her place and demand that she return the hoodie, rather than try to cleverly get it back during a gathering full of tears and drama.
