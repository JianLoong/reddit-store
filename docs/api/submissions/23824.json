I work and take care of all the bills while she takes care of all the household chores. That is our arrangement\n\nTwo years ago, the startup I worked at went through an IPO, because of which I made a small fortune. This money when invested properly was enough for us to lead a decent middle class life without me ever having to work again. And that's exactly what I did (invest the money) over the last two years. It now generates a good passive income and I was finally able to quit my job \n\nMy job was very hectic so I just want to relax now for a few years and then maybe do something else. But my wife now wants me to do household chores. I don't mind helping her a bit but she expects an even 50:50 split, since I don't work anymore and am mostly free\n\nThis is something I'm against as 1) I still pay all the bills. So even if I technically don't work anymore, I'm still holding my part of the deal and so should she. And 2) As stated before, I do intend to do something (maybe start a business?) a few years down the road and this is just a temporary break so it shouldn't warrant changing our arrangement \n\nMy wife thinks I'm an ass for this while I don't and we obviously disagree with each other over this issue.

She\u2019s your wife not your maid. Why don\u2019t you employ someone to do the chores then you can both enjoy the benefits of your good fortune.", "YTA. This isn\u2019t a logical debate. It\u2019s about caring for your partner. You got lucky. That\u2019s all that was. So now you pay the bills and want a maid to do everything for you? I mean wife. Wait I can\u2019t tell the difference. Help out your partner", "\"I don't mind helping her a bit but she expects an even 50:50 split, since I don't work anymore and am mostly free\"\n\nYour wife is right, you are wrong.  YTA  \n\n\"I do intend to do something (maybe start a business?) a few years down the road \"\n\nExcellent news!  You can go back to your previous arrangement, then.  Until then, get off your ass and do your chores.", "YTA. Part of the reason you were able to be successful as an engineer is because your wife took care of you and the home to make sure you could commit to your job. Even if you payed the bills, her labour still went uncompensated for and benefited you. \nNow that you don\u2019t work your agreement isn\u2019t valid anymore, the reason she takes care of the chores is so you can work, not just provide passively. You want to rest .. but what about her? She doesn\u2019t get time off? You either do the chores with her or pay someone else to do them.", "YTA.  I would NOT be happy if I was still participating in boring 'have tos' of life and my partner wasn't.  By sharing in those, you're also more equitably balancing time for 'want tos'.  It isn't just about paying the bills.", "YTA taking a (few) years holiday while your wife has to look after you.. TF you think you are, god??? Husbands go to work, not sit around under people's feet doing a whole lot of nothing (yes I have a job), or they get the boot.. do your chores or get a job. You are not an infant in need of care", "YTA. You are treating your wife like paid labor instead of a partner. You have all the free time to help her and show you value your home but you want to be lazy and hold money over her head instead. Gross. \n\nIf you're gonna start a business, go do that I guess but til then? Help the heck out.", "YTA. She's your wife, not your servant. If you contribute to the clutter of the home, you get to help clean it up.", "YTA. A marriage is a partnership. You share in the good times and bad times. To keep all the benefits of the situation and not give her any benefit is not being a good partner. Why not contribute more to make her happy and feel supported? You\u2019ll still have plenty of free time. Or hire a housekeeper to come once in a while if you hate cleaning so much and if you have the money. Your attitude is selfish and childish. She\u2019s your life partner, not a maid.\n\nIf she\u2019s been doing 100% of the home maintenance/cleaning, and you haven\u2019t done it in a while, you\u2019re likely underestimating the energy it takes. It can be a lot of work.", "YTA! I know, you are the breadwinner and you\u2019ve always done what you are supposed to. Things have now changed. If you both split the chores, you will have more time to spend together. See what she does for you and you can bond with her or at least have a new appreciation. Not that it matters but, do you make her mow the lawn too?", "If you were actively working, that would be one thing. But you aren't. You have the same amount of free time they do.\n\nYou worked hard, and got lucky. And now you don't have to worry about money anymore. Good for you. I'm a little envious.\n\nBut the chores are still there. They didn't go away. The obligation that you have to go to work went away, but the chores didn't. They are still there. They are still yours to split with your partner. Having money in your pocket doesn't mean your partner has to clean up after you. That isn't a partnership. You are treating her like a bangmaid. I'd be pissed too. YTA", "YTA. You make a mess\u2026 you have some responsibility to take care of it. \n\nPay someone if you\u2019re so distraught about it.", "YTA and I hope your wife leaves you and takes half of your money.\n\nYes, I'm serious. That's what she is entitled to. You did not luck out and work your ass off. *You both* lucked out. You know full well you could not have dedicated all that time to that IPO if your wife did not take a massive risk and agree to torpedo her career to take care of a house all by herself.\n\nNow that you both took the risk and both paid the price in labor, you want to keep all of the spoils of her sacrifice to yourself.\n\nWell, life's not like that, champ. You just think it is because you do not value your wife. You do not value her sacrifices. You think chores are just meaningless work for meaningless women, one of which is just your ~~bangmaid~~ wife.\n\nMy brother in Christ I make six figures more than my wife and I do just as much around the house as her because *her sacrifices* enabled me to be this high-earning and I am genuinely and fully and completely the asshole if I took all that she gave to our relationship, looked back, and said, yep, this is mine and told her that she is dogshit to me.\n\nApologize to your wife. Grovel. Buy her something nice and grovel more. YTA in this 100%.", "YTA Here we go again, it\u2019s another man who confused his wife for the maid. Your wife does not cook and clean because it is her job, her role, her place as a woman, or whatever misogynist bs you cooked up to justify not pulling your weight at home. She cooks and cleans because she supports you in your career and this allows you to focus on your job instead of spreading yourself too thin. You built this net worth BECAUSE of her help, and now you have the cheek to think of it as YOUR money. Now that your schedule is free you have no justification for not doing half. You are not \u201chelping her\u201d because she isn\u2019t your housekeeper/maid/cook and it isn\u2019t her job.", "YTA\n\nIf you have so much money and don't want to clean up after yourself get a cleaning service.  Your wife isn't your servant just because you made some money, its not the 1600s.", "YTA. What a ridiculous state of mind to have. You're an adult living with you partner. You both contribute to making the mess, you both contribute to cleaning it. Household chores are meant to be shared 50/50. You have no reason to escape having to do any chores because you made some money. If the thought of cleaning up after yourself is so abhorrent , hire a maid and I don't mean your wife. Why do imagine she wants to do all the chores? Where did this strange thought that this would be ok come from? Do you want a wife who resents you every single day or do you want to compromise and have a healthy relationship?", "YTA. You\u2019re approaching this like a business deal and behaving childishly, instead of acting like the adult spouse that you are.\n\nThe reason she took on 100% when you were working was 1) the income was necessary and 2) being charitable, you didn\u2019t have the time or energy to take on much of anything. These were the circumstances when the \u201cdeal\u201d was made.\n\nBoth of those things have changed, and we\u2019re talking about someone you\u2019re supposed to be building a life with as a partner, not dealing with at arms length like this is a commercial contract. You actively working is no longer necessary to sustain your household, you admittedly have inordinate amounts of free time, and you purportedly want to continue building a life with your wife.", "INFO: Do you like your wife? E.g. don't you wish she could enjoy the passive income? Or you two together could enjoy some nice things together? \n\nBecause if she didn't work unpaid for you, all these years, just ask yourself how much you would've performedwhile also stressing about the household AND paying someone to do the household.", "Yta. You think bc she stayed home and took care of household obligations, (which no likely helped to launch you to where you are financially now bc you only had to concentrate on work) you believe that her contribution is frivolous.  That your free time is more important than hers. You want a bang maid. Not an equal partner.  Huge AH", "YTA. It is not YOUR money, it never was. It is money you earn as a couple, you by working outside the house and her by working inside the house. Now there is no work outside the house so you have to share the work that is actually left to do, inside the house. Your logic is flawed if you think that the money you earn is not a shared asset because your wife stays at home.\n\nI also cannot believe you're fine with lazying around and enjoying free time while your wife should not change a thing. You suck as a partner really.", "If you were single and lived alone you would still have to do household chores. YTA. She is your partner not your maid/nanny", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re such as asshole.  I can picture you sitting around all day and just watching her clean up your mess and you repeating that it was all your hard work that made this life happen and this was the deal she agreed to.   To even have the audacity to ask this makes you a bigger AH.\n\nIf the situation was reversed and bad luck happened to your investments, you would expect her to work to make money.", "JFC pick up after yourself and do home maintenance, why are you making your relationship so transactional?\n\nYTA", "Yta , you said your agreement involved you working which you no longer are . \n\nIf I were your wife I'd expect 50/50 on chores , that way there'd be more time together or for me to focus on hobbies . \n\nShe's not your caretaker , she's your partner.", "YTA she did the chores before because you were at work now your home do your fair share just because you pay dosent mean anything marriage is a partnership and if you don't see that I hope she wises up and leaves you. Best hope you got a pre nup!", "Yes, YTA. You've got all the time in the world now, don't just slob around while your wife picks up after you.", "YTA.

Marriage isn\u2019t 50/50, it\u2019s 100% from both of you", "yeah YTA. the agreement was that she did all the chores because she stayed home. now that you stay home too, you should be sharing that responsibility. especially if you\u2019re making messes at home.", "YTA. Your agreement was to split the work evenly. Your situation has changed so now the split looks different.", "YTA", "YTA you wanna relax for a few years? How stressful do you think sweeping and laundry actually are?

Wake up.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t want to do the chores, hire a maid.", "Any arrangement about financial contributions vis-a-vis domestic contributions needs to be something that both parties are comfortable with. Having you around the house all day will naturally increase the amount of chores that need to be done and potentially disrupt her chore routines. You should, at minimum, be willing to offset that by picking up some slack. \n\nSoft YTA, but also, I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t have children because you didn\u2019t mention it. If you do have kids and she\u2019s handling 100% of that responsibility as well, then you\u2019d be a gigantic AH.", "YTA You are no longer working. You should be splitting chores. Part of the reason you could work so much before was that your wife was home taking care of everything.

I'd rather be a single parent than work my ass off around the house and raising children while watching my \"partner\" fuck off and do nothing.", "YTA. Would you have been able to devote as much time as you did to your startup if she hasn\u2019t been taking care of everything at home? Could you have pulled the same hours and put the same energy into it as you did because everything outside of work was handled for you? You didn\u2019t get there alone, you got there with the support of your wife, now that you have enough to live on there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t split chores", "YTA", "YTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is your wife not your maid. \n\nHelp around the house.", "YTA. So what exactly do you do all day? Sit on your ass and brag about your money? Your wife isn't demanding that you do all the chores, just half. You stuff your face with the food she cooks. You make at least half the messes. It isn't fair that you're demanding that she continue working for the rest of your life just because you have passive income. You're selfish and lazy.", "Hang on, let me get this right here. You want to sit round on your arse for a couple of years (!) while your wife is your maid? \n\nYTA. Can you hear yourself when you say this? You don't realise what is wrong with this?? \n\nThis is so disrespectful to your wife. She's supposed to be your life partner, not your servant.", "YTA.\n\nThe adults in the household are responsible for maintaining the household. Work with your wife to maintain the household and then you can both play video games and screw around.\n\nIt\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about being a team for the rest of your lives, and making the best life possible for the both of you together.", "Are you making 50% of the mess?  JFC you are such a jerk I hope she divorces you and takes half of everything.", "I\u2019m so confused. How many hours of chores will you have to do? You don\u2019t have kids, no? You can\u2019t spend 20 minutes a day folding a load of laundry and doing dishes? Like what sort of house work are you doing?!?", "YTA the only reason you were able to make a small fortune is bc your wife held everything down at home\n\nthis is exactly what my parents did, and to this day my dad tells everyone the only reason he\u2019s been as successful as he is, is because of how hard my mom worked to raise the kids and took care of everything at home", "YTA. Is understandable you want to rest but not splitting the chores at least 70/30 would be super unfair to your wife and you'll end up treating her as a maid. Also, you're not planning on starting a new business right now but some years down the line and then your agreement might change again. These kind of arrangement must be subjected to flexibility and changes, they're not written in stone.", "YTA.", "YTA.

Yes you\u2019re \u201cpaying the bills\u201d, but you\u2019re also lounging around the house meanwhile. It\u2019s common sense that you should pick up more chores (or any chores at all) since you\u2019re home more.", "YTA either stretch the budget to hire help OR find a part time job to bring in enough to cover YOUR half of the chores.

That you can't retire at 30 and have someone pull all your adulting weight outside your spreadsheets?\n\nGrowing up is hard, but with support you will surely get the hang of it. No? \n\nYou could let her out of the arrangement so she could find a man while you shoot for Peter Pan, but there would be a spousal support factor, and of course child support.

Also it's your space too.", "YTA \n\nYou sound about as cozy and flexible as being married to a laptop.", "YTA. So, you\u2019re comfortable sitting on your butt while your wife does everything. \n\nBecause of the agreement you both made you had the opportunity and ability to make a large sum of money, your wife never had that opportunity or ability.", "While you were working so was she: unpaid labour in the home keeping it clean, cooking, laundry etc. You never had to do that.

I work and take care of all the bills while she takes care of all the household chores. That is our arrangement\n\nTwo years ago, the startup I worked at went through an IPO, because of which I made a small fortune. This money when invested properly was enough for us to lead a decent middle class life without me ever having to work again. And that's exactly what I did (invest the money) over the last two years. It now generates a good passive income and I was finally able to quit my job \n\nMy job was very hectic so I just want to relax now for a few years and then maybe do something else. But my wife now wants me to do household chores. I don't mind helping her a bit but she expects an even 50:50 split, since I don't work anymore and am mostly free\n\nThis is something I'm against as 1) I still pay all the bills. So even if I technically don't work anymore, I'm still holding my part of the deal and so should she. And 2) As stated before, I do intend to do something (maybe start a business?) a few years down the road and this is just a temporary break so it shouldn't warrant changing our arrangement \n\nMy wife thinks I'm an ass for this while I don't and we obviously disagree with each other over this issue.
