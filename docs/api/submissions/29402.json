You are not a charity which provides rent geared to income housing. Your roomie needs to increase their income or cut their expenses.", "NTA. She is your roommate and only that. If she can't pay rent, she needs to find another place to live.", "I wouldn\u2019t even have a conversation about it I would just say \u201cI don\u2019t agree if you find that you\u2019re unable to afford the rent consider moving in with your parents and finding someone to take over your end of the lease \u201c", "NTA.  You're roommates, not spouses.", "NTA sit her down and explain proportional billing is only for dating and married couples.", "Nta the percentage split happens with romantic partners or say, one bedroom is twice the size of the other.", "Emily needs to get a new job or a second job.  Unless you have larger room or more amenities, even split stays. NTA", "NTA This would also be a huge mistake on her part. Let\u2019s say you agreed to pay for more than half (you should not), then anytime she wants to splurge on something, she\u2019s going to think you\u2019re judging her for it, which will only lead to toxicity between you two.", "The only time it may be appropriate to play differing rent is if someone has the primary bedroom and an en-suite, and the other person has a tiny room. Assuming everyone has the (about) same sized room, there is no need to spit rent in anything other than 50/50.", "Good point.  Though even with different sized rooms, that split should be negotiated way before anyone signs a lease.", "NTA.  Roommates don't do unequal splits.  That is couples.  Emily agreed.  Signed the lease.  Her opportunity to do something different.  Is when the lease expires.  Then she can move.  I don't care what her salary is.  You are not responsible for her.", "NTA. You're roommates not life partners. Het income isn't your issue; she can find a 2nd job or seek higher paid employment", "NTA you might want to find a different roommate", "NTA and Emily is a loon. I assumed that she was arguing that you have the bigger room, or the assigned parking or some other perk, making it reasonable for you to pay a bit more. Expecting you to just because you make more is not fair. She needs to tighten her budget or find a higher paying job.", "NAH unless her response to you was rude/entitled. She imo was not overstepping assuming she asked politely and accepted your answer, and you are obviously not TA for saying no.", "It's not a bad idea as long as Emily does all the cleaning and cooking for the two of you. Maybe the laundry also.", "Nta", "The way I see it. You're not helping her by paying more rent. You're paying for her elective expenses", "First, even if I agree that the difference in salary is irrelevant to the situation you still don't want to be that person who says ppl choose a lower salary and so it's there fault they don't have more money. Those lower paying jobs are still necessary for society to function and no one should be shamed for taking them.\n\nSecond, who has the bigger room? I've never seen a 2 bedroom where one room wasn't bigger or better in some way than the other. Whoever has the good room should pay anywhere between 30-50 a week more. \n\nYou are right, you are not required to supplement her costs of living.", "NTA. Socialism never works.", "Are you emilys spouse or parent that she expects you to finance her life?", "yeah no, NTA\n\nTell her that unless you are in a relationship(ie with fringe benefits), that finances are not shared.  That you pay what you agreed to pay(per lease/agreement).\n\nHer finances are not your concern.  She should NOT have chose to rent new apt if she could not afford it.  \n\nNow if you were getting a greater share of the apartment(ie an extra room as a home office).  Then that would be reasonable to figure out a fair distribution of rent per use.(or you moved in a partner). \n\nHowever, if the circumstances have not changed from the time of agreement, then you should not have to pay for her share of expenses.", "They are roomates - not SO's, not BF/GF moving in together, not partners, not engaged, not an on again/off again couple or two people who share kids. When you are roomates, you are electing to rent a place, on your own, for which your fiscal share will be one half of all expenses, regardless of circumstances.", "When you rent a place as roomates, you are each, individually, agreeing to rent a \"half apartment.\" Your decision to sign the lease is your own and you have no sensible reason to expect a roomie to pay more than there legally obligated half.", "Even in that scenario, the unequal rent split should have been agreed on ahead of time. It's unfair to try to change the agreement after the fact.", "Yes, or, we used to still split rent down the middle in that case BUT, the person with the master had to pay for the extra parking space."]}
