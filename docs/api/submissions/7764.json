No one under 18. But we have a lot of friends and relatives with children so we came up with what we thought was a great compromise.  \n\nWe arranged for the nursing rooms and the coffee area to be available at the church for anyone under 18.  And we included that on the invitations.  So mom's and infants could still watch the ceremony and older kids could stay glued to their phones without interrupting our wedding.  We even fot some church ladies to be available in the coffee area to help with any minor problems. \n\nAt the reception we arranged for a room at the hall to be made available for anyone under 18 and paid for some girls from the local high school to be there as babysitters since it wouldn't be fair to expect older kids to take care of the younger ones.  There was a tv in the room and we had Pixar movies running.  We also ordered pizza and pop for the whole group. Once again this was made very clear on the invitations.  \n\nBut we are still dealing with people who are mad at us for doing this.  My cousin is mad that her baby couldn't be at the ceremony.  Her baby is six and cannot go to McDonald's without having a fit.  \n\nSome of the older kids were pissed that they had to get dressed up to sit in a room. Then get their pictures taken. Then sit in another room. I have heard from a couple of my neices that they are upset with me for making them get dressed up but not letting them come to the wedding or reception. \n\nEvery time that is point out that I asked everyone not to bring their kids because they weren't going to be allowed at the ceremony or reception I get crapped on.  I feel like I was doomed either way.  I tried to compromise and now I'm still being called an asshole.\n\n#EDIT\n\nI didn't invite nthe children that came.  I did not ask the kids that showed up to dress up.  In no way, shape, or form did I insinuate that kids who dressed up would be allowed to come tomthe wedding or the reception.  When I said that the girls complained about getting dressed up it is because their parents made them dress up and blamed it on me.  They could have worn footie pajamas for all I cared.  They were included in the pictures because my grandmother asked.

My solution was \u201cno worries, just don\u2019t come\u201d.\n\nYou did great.", "NTA - people obviously need to work on their reading comprehension. This was a perfect opportunity to either a) not bring their kids at all, b) utilize the babysitting that YOU provided or c) just not attend the wedding. \n\nYou went above and beyond, but everything seems to think their kid(s) is special.", "You went WAY above and beyond here. This is seriously exceeding my own expectations of what a child free wedding with arranged childcare might look like. I say might because I've never heard of a bride being this cool about it. You sound awesome, and if anyone is upset about the accommodations you made, remind them that most child free weddings are up to the parents to figure it out. NTA.", "NTA. Do not discuss it further with anyone, if they bring it up. Do not engage.", "NTA. Honestly the fact that you arranged childcare is super nice and generous. Lots of people choose to have child free weddings and I get it, screaming kids can totally mess up a wedding. You cared enough to do everything in your power to include your friends and relatives with young children so they could attend and not have to worry about their kids, I really see nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. Your set up fills me with rage cause I\u2019m imagining how fucking miserable 13 year old me would be stuck in a room with a bunch of screaming crying kids with nothing but my phone and pixar movies to entertain myself. BUT, I would have been pissed at my parents for bringing me when I\u2019m old enough to be home alone. That\u2019s not on you to accommodate kids that don\u2019t really need to be with their parents (none of it\u2019s on you, but especially that)\n\nThe set up sounds nice for the younger kids, and I\u2019m not sure what else parents would expect you to do without compromising what you wanted your wedding day to be.", "NTA and a child-free wedding sounds like heaven.", "NTA. You and your husband (congrats btw) put a lot of thought and effort into finding a compromise that would allow children to attend your wedding while still maintaining the \"child-free\" atmosphere that you wanted.\n\nSome guests may not have been thrilled with the arrangements, but you made it clear on the invitations and took steps to make sure that the children would be well-cared for during the wedding.\n\nIt was your wedding and you had the right to make decisions about how you want it to be.

It was then incumbent upon the parents to make external child care arrangements if they weren't on board with your solution. I think you provided a reasonable solution to accomodate those who decided to bring their kids anyway. If the parents weren't happ or found your accomodation sub par, they should have just left the kids at home.", "NTA. If you want to go to events at which children are not allowed, and you don't want to pay for childcare, then don't have children. You cannot have all three of those things.\n\nYou went above and beyond by arranging an area for children at the venue. The guests who are mad at you are incredibly rude and entitled.", "NTA\n\nI got married almost 9 years ago and people are still salty about no kids at the wedding. We did not provide childcare.\n\nI wanted a loud ass party with an open bar, that's not a place for kids. Some of my relatives thanked me because they never get a night out without kids and a few of them are still mad.\n\nYou know who isn't mad? Me and my wife, we're happy as fuck.", "INFO: Did you ask that they be dressed up?", "NTA. You say you were clear about not inviting children so that should be it.", "NTA\n\nPSA for any future couples planning a wedding.  If you have lots of children in your family/friends, having a child free wedding will most likely not go over very well.", "NTA It was really nice of you to have a space for anyone under 18. If anyone was upset about their kids not being allowed to the ceremony, maybe they should\u2019ve read the invitation.", "NTA. You went above and beyond for them. They could have left their kids at home.", "NTA\n\nYou made it clear on the invitation children under 18 were not allowed. It is those parents fault for making thier older kids get dressed up to just come sit in a room. Unfortunately they're making it totally your fault. Next time I would say \"I'm sorry you feel that way. However, I made it perfectly clear to your parents that kids under 18 were not allowed. Here, it says right here on the invitation.\" Then let the parents deal with it.", "NTA. What you did was extremely thoughtful and generous. Many people have a child-free wedding and childcare is completely up to the parents. Anyone giving you crap about this is absolutely the AH.\n\nCongratulations!", "I N F O: *Did* you ask them to get dressed up for pictures?\n\nEdit: With added info, NTA. You gave an inch and they\u2019re mad they couldn\u2019t have the whole ruler.", "NTA. I have attended quite a lot of weddings over my years and have been a bridesmaid and maid of honor many times. As the bride, it\u2019s your decision to have or not have children under 18 at your wedding ceremony and reception. You even made the accommodations for your guests that they would not have to hire babysitters in order to attend your wedding. This was generous. I have been at weddings where no children under 18 were allowed, no exceptions. Other weddings had children allowed at the reception but not the ceremony. Others had children allowed at the ceremony but not the reception. \n\nUnfortunately children are not predictable in their behavior and as such can ruin weddings. Yes ruin them. I have seen at one reception where a little boy around 9 years old dressed in his suit, pull the white linen table cloth holding the wedding cake and other desserts, entirely off the table in a fit of rage. Everyone was surprised and the bride cried and the groom was horrified that their cake was on the floor and no photos would be taken of this special moment. What did the boys parents do? They said \u201cboys will be boys\u201d and laughed. Yeah. This was at the Four Seasons Hotel where his parents told the couple they were bringing their son and he is well behaved and would be good. They showed up with him even though children were not allowed. Yeah. So going back to what I wrote is that children\u2019s behavior are unpredictable and you cannot guarantee they will be well behaved and things can get out of hand quickly without supervision by their parents.", "NTA. I think you're being more accommodating than most.", "NTA - but I think you made the mistake of putting the responsibility of childcare on yourself and therefore became the target for people\u2019s grievances. I would\u2019ve just said \u201chey nobody younger than 18. Sorry but get a babysitter, workout a play date, I don\u2019t care. But this is how the wedding will be.\u201d Sure people would THEN complain you didn\u2019t provide any help. But those people are going to complain anyway so no point in pleasing them.", "NTA - Child free weddings are acceptable and you've gone above and beyond to make rules.  Personally I didn't want 12 and under, teens are not going to run around and ruin things.  Just know if you make rules, they have the right to say no.", "You're NTA. It sounds like you went over the top accommodating people with children. You did way more than most people do at their child free weddings.", "NTA. your wedding, your rules. you accommodated the needs of those who were underage and made it clear what was happening from the beginning through the invitation. people are just upset because they didn\u2019t get there way, but on your day, what they want doesn\u2019t matter. and if they can\u2019t respect your wishes on your wedding day, then that\u2019s their problem.", "INFO Why did they have to get dressed up for photos if they aren't part of the wedding?", "NTA. It's not your fault if people cannot read the invitations.", "NTA but having this on site was the problem - close enough to see but not allowed into the room? Not surprised the older ones got upset.\n\nThe plan was good but it should have been somewhere nearby not at the same venue", "I tried to arrange it the same as you did. No-one agreed beforehand, or were at least telling us they did not like that their children could not be at the ceremony and would be taken care of in another room. In the end we got married with our parents, our best friends and a photograpjer and his wife as the only guests lol. Of course every-one was not satisfied with that option either. But we were, it was a beautiful day. Life would get more difficult soon and we kind of knew that, so we made memory we could cherish.\nAnyway, NTA. You can't win these things I guess.", "NTA - People today feel that they are entitled to bring children, or even pets, anywhere they want.  YOU gave specific invites and even arranged for those who would need help in caring for the kids.  YOU are NTA!", "What the ...?!!!  If you threw a cocktail party, would you even have to MENTION \"no children\"?   A wedding is sooo much more special, and geared toward adults.  Not slamming those who want to invite children to their weddings, but good grief, other people.  Not your event!\n\nGuests have **NO RIGHT** ***(ZERO!  NONE!)*** to complain or even to comment about the guest list.  That is a blazing breach of the most basic manners taught in KINDERGARTEN, brainiacs!!  Unless your child is specifically named on the invitation you received, or receives a separate one, your child is not to show up.  \n\nJust remember, OP, the entitled minority is usually the most vocal.\n\nPlease hang on to all the compliments you must have received about a lovely ceremony and wonderful reception.  Ignore the ungrateful complainers who were lucky to be invited and given such extra consideration by you.\n\nedited for spelling and verdict NTA", "NTA omg people kill me like how are their choices your fault?", "So you make accommodations so that your friends and family don't have to pay for babysitters or opt out of the wedding, and they still complained!\n\nNTA, but the ones complaining sure sound like TA. Honestly, if you have anymore complaints coming in, I'd seriously tell them they made the choice to use your accommodations instead of paying for a babysitter, you get what you get.", "I think its shitty to make them participate in pictures and such if you exclude them from your wedding. I've been there though and it's a tough line to walk. I just found out 6 years after we got married that my brother and his wife are done holding their grudge about their 4 year old daughter, at the time,  not being invited. I get it. I think being a tight family, people expect their children will be invited as well. A lotttt of people have trouble separating the fact that their kids are still kids, they aren't a part of them. My family is my unit, one for all, all for one type deal. I get feeling slighted that someone I love could invite me but can view my kid as separate for a wedding invitation. Probably at least half is married folk have been in your boat. It's shitty. There's capacity issues, there's cost issues, and a lot of times above all- there's the issue of having kids throw tantrums and fuck up your wedding that takes so much planning and shelling out $$$. I don't think you're an asshole for excluding kids at the wedding, that's part of life and your family will get over it. You actually went above and beyond by finding a good way to accommodate them- somewhere on the premises so worried parents can still check in on the kids. That's huge and great of you. I think the only way you could be an asshole is if you were still vague on the invite, although, if they're close enough to be giving you shit over I'd think you'd have talked about the situation before hand. \n-\u2010-------\n\nSomething like:\n\nMr, mrs., thing one and thing 2 you're invited to our wedding! We will have another rooms for the things to watch movies and eat pizza! Hope to see you there!\n\n-----\nThat checks the specifics you mentioned but also leaves it vague enough to assume the kids are invited. I could see being pissed if I made my kids get ready and done up to come a wedding to get stuck in a room for 6 hours and only allowed to come out when you want them included in pictures and nothing else. That'd be shitty. It should have said kids won't be included but we've got a room and sitters if you're not comfortable or unable to leave them behind for the night.\n\nSo I guess I'd say info, but if I had to choose I'd guess not TA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
